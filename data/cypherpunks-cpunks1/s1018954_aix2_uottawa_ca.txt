Sorry if this has been stated before, but exactly when do Chaum's first
set up e-cash related patents expire? I looked it up in applied crypto
the last time I had my hands on it and couldn't find the dates. How many (and what) patents are there in this field anyway? (don't bother with that if it's too long to answer)
 my visit to Dachau
Well I don't think so. The pilots missions were to bomb the cities of England.
This was in turn to further the meglomaniac plans of the Fuhrer to create
a european police state under his personal rule with all objectors murdered.
Analysis of the aims of the research must not simply stop at the immediate
result but through to the wider goals towards which the research was intended to contribute. In this context we see that the objective was not to
save lives but to destroy them in the furtherance of a plan to enslave the
entire population of Europe. spread, I'm not a libertarian, or an anarcho-capitalist.  I do, however, support rapid deployment, without restrictions, of strong crypto.  Here's why:
(1) It is impossible to stop these technologies; someone on the list recently reminded us that a bright fourteen year old could reproduce the basic functionality of PGP in a brief period of time.  The mathematics of, say, RSA, are fairly basic.  I think it's unreasonable to outlaw multiplication of prime numbers, don't you?
(2) While these technologies allow people to violate the law, I have enough faith in humanity to believe that civilization won't collapse as a result.  There have always been criminals, and there have always been revolutionaries.  Only recently has "The State" been able to supress these forces without maintaining a physical presence.  Crypto merely returns us to that default.  (3) These technologies also allow honest, law-abiding citizens to protect themselves from criminals, both within and outside the government.  Industrial espionage can be defeated through strong crypto, for example.  J. Edgar Hoover would have been powerless to harass Martin Luther King, jr. had MLK had access to strong crypto.
Obviously, these aren't the only reasons to use strong crypto, and everybody will almost definitely disagree with them as I've described.  But it's one answer, anyway.

True, but there's still a licencing requirment in the states (might be different up here). So an authentication necktie (as opposed to cryptographic shorts and shirts) would be on the principle that one should
not need a licence to write software. They don't care, too easy to counterfeit. Inflation through photocopying
would make monopoly currency as worthless as the funny money it is now.
OTOH, if you threw in strong two-way anon digicash onto a networked version,
you'd basically have a gambling setup masquarading as a MUD. See how long that would last unscathed? It would be a nice way to introduce the masses
to the concepts though. Make the code available and you might see servers springing up faster than the present digicash casinos. And since any of the parties involved might be tempted to cheat ("upgrading" the server in the sysadmin's favor, ganging up ...) some authentication might be needed.
Which means even more education for Joe Gambler.
Since doing this for real money, even real digicash, is already illegal in many places, it would finally drive home the need for anon security
and crypto to the eager gambler (of which there are many more than eager
pgp users).
If you make it look loony enough, the authorities might find it beneath them
to do anything. Given any success you could launch some additional for-pay services based on the same platform.
It's only a game, right?

Wellcome to Ottawa.
Don't worry about it, Canada's not even a foreign country according to ITAR.
If you have pgp on that machine, you haven't exported it, but it's still covered by export controls.
We pretty much have exactly the same export restrictions on US origin software, but if it comes from anywhere else (including Canada of course)
it can be exported without a permit to all but four countries (iran, cuba
and two others) and cannot be exported at all to UN embargoed countries
(bosnia, iraq, angola...). Since none of these have good net access, it's not much of a prob. The issue of whether ftp is an export hadn't resolved when I asked, and there might be a headache regarding US intellectual property and that US origin problem. So basically you can't export pgp, nautilus, rsaref..., but if they were rewritten from the ground up in Canada and put on the net, you *might* be ok. (that ignores the last issue, so ask Foreign Affairs and maybe a lawyer first, though I really can't see how a public domain idea can have a ElGamal and IDEA would be completely without problems as they are not even American intellectual property.
Of course, I'm not a lawyer, and the gov has no obligation to agree with the advice of its own employees.
If you're interested I could mail you the address and phone no. of the export
controls division of external affairs. The policy officer was rather helpful. They also have a big booklet on export controls.
If you plan on going over, might as well ask about the American citizenship problem that's come up in the Anguila thread. Sounds very funny.

Canada had exactly the same tax and had to eliminate it two years ago
after massive smuggling (supposedly in large part through native
reserves that straddle the border). The cigarette companies were actively
(I won't say alleged, it was definite) involved in the process, as they
exported their goods to a non-existant US market and let the packs sit
in cargo trailers to be picked up. Needless to say, there was no tax on exports. The previous gov had imposed one but had to drop it after massive cig. co lobbying alleging that Americans (who never even received the Canadian cigs) would switch to their own brands and jobs would be lost.
Cigarettes are a rather large industry and at the time were basically
operating a black market. One wonders how much easier this will become
once someone gets around to setting up a hard credible anon payment scheme.
The corporate willingness is certainly there. And I really don't see the securities industry (specifically currency markets) sticking around
once some competitive and sufficiently anon alternatives to the SEC go online
and offshore. Some sort of market regs enforcement is essential though,
you'll never have enough investor confidence for economically significant
blacknet exchanges otherwise.

Does he mean mandatory commercial key escrow (as in clipper keys held
by credit agencies?) Or something totally voluntary but standardized
by the gov? *Rant mode on*
I've heard cracking into Equifax and TRW is considered a rite of passage in the phreaker crowd. The security would have to *damn* tight (as in forget it) for it to be trustworthy. And since it would probably be the big three
credit rating agencies (I forget the other one), their track record is not reassuring. I don't see these people securely using crypto throughout the entire org (in such a large org) in the future if they don't already.
Seeing my key sold to Son of Blacknet(LD) by Sons of Mitnick is not For that matter, what sort of databases would they consider holding this on?
And how easy would it be for the general public to get access to their key,
to verify for accuracy and revoke compromised keys. (big prob with the credit rating agencies) Who would be allowed (if anyone) or mandated (depending on which scheme) to certify the security? If NSA is mentionned, one might also point out the job Matt Blaze did on their Clipper. Bad production values don't make for good public security. Of course it all depends on exactly why they really want the escrow anyway.
If people will encrypt a second time with tomorrow's pgp, why should anyone
care? All you'd single encrypt for would be your income tax and the financial records you're already required by law to keep (I'm sure I've
misunderstood this. Can't be so useless.). I know that's not a particularily
diplomatic carry-over from the debated-to-death clipper thing, but really,
except as PR, why DO they still take this seriously? (unless you want to be paranoid about a ban, hmm, nevermind, debated-to-death)
Speaking of organizational crypto, anyone know what the scheme used in
Notes is? I know there's RSA... This seems rather more useful to examine
than MS's browser, considering corporations are making it a standard for groupwork. All you'd get on a browser would be credit no's and maybe e-mail.
Notes nets might carry the entirety of a company's docs and work in progress.

Strange things like crypto really become popularized (even through notoriety) when they "shouldn't" be had. Also seems like the only way to get any mainstream press. Bad press is better than next to none. BBrother schemes like clipper also generate lotsa mainstream
press. I can't wait for Freeh and Clinton to start making sweet releases about the sequel. Big ones. What's going on on that front anyway?
Being paranoid is a prerequisite for being on this list in the first place :-)
But seriously, yes I do agree with you. We know just how much they'd love
to get rid of it. That being said, wasn't legal protection for crypto the reason EFF caved on the dreaded DT bill? (sorry, DT law. Yech, that's tough)
First they're going to have to get rid of that. How strong is the protection anyway? *Begin flogging dead horse* (not a Unicorn)
Fine, let's just say I don't think I it can stick, we could argue this back and forth and I'm sure it's been done before. We benefit from any
move towards a ban through a measure of publicity. We benefit once again from a ban due to programmers like Phil Z. getting terrified and outraged
enough to write code. PGP is the product of a previous attempted ban.
We'd be have PEM or RIPEM otherwise (with no-one using them). If there is a market to avoid american anti-privacy and subpeona regs, openly or in the black, this is where it will get its start. I understand that key signing parties are all the rage at ietf meetings. I think a lot of those people would be angry enough to go for a strong privacy IP before any ban went into effect. Remember the US is not the whole of the world. Go to Anguila or Vancouver or Montreal or Baja Cali...with those thoughts in your head, and you can have your cpunk ietf meeting and implement and distribute the code. Flog Flog Flog
And then there's the courts...
I think any ban of a "desirable" product is self defeating. Just look at how little popular and even police support the marijuana ban has. Even Newt admits to having tried. Unlike crypto, marijuana has a physical presence and requires transportation, even then it's also totally unenforceable (even though it lands a very large amount of people in jail). A lot of people OTOH support the ban on cocaine, yet somehow, supposedly crack only costs $5/vial in NYC, and is available in every city in the world. A crypto ban would be even harder than making people pay for all their software. Pirate software is illegal in most of the world. Are the fine legislators of North America, where practically all the software is written, totally innocent of this heinous crime?
It can't stick. Either outcome puts crypto and anonymity ahead in some way.

   Fact [comp]
   512 Bit number factored by '97
   Before 1997 GMT a number of the following form will have been
   factored. The number must be at least 512 bits long, and be the
   product of two primes, each at least 200 bits long. The factoring
   method must not rely on any special properties of the number (except
   the fact that there are only two factors). In particular, if the
   factors were chosen by the group doing the factoring, then the
   technique must not have used any information about the particular
   factors chosen. The result must be published in a reputable journal.
   The paper must include a description of how the factoring was
   accomplished. The result must be reproducible, at least in theory (it
   need not have been reproduced). To be judged one year later to allow
   time for publication. Note: 512 bit number means number >= 2^511 A
   project to factor 512 bit number might not qualify because the factors
   are too small or there are 3 factors. They will know before you.    Owner: loki at nately.ucsd.edu, Wording changes allowed by Owner

obtainable from seeds of plants of the Datura family, as in Belladona (aka Nightshade), Stramonium (aka Jimson Weed) and a few others. They can be obtained from a variety of botanical catalogs (and probably in your backyard) and are highly toxic hallucinogens (only the bad ones are legal). I think their chemicals (atropine, hyoscamine and scopolamine) are also available as pharmaceuticals as they have some legitimate medical applications.
I've heard from several sources that the US mil also checked it out (once upon a paranoid rumor that turned into an urban legend mayhap) as truth serum. Supposedly in certain S. American countries it has been used for quite some time in thefts. An added benefit is amnesia.

I'm happy someone's trying to give some thought to language security during the design phase (no matter how ineffective, Perry).

A fair amount of alt.test postings seem to be pgp'd (though a lot were
Detweiler Blacknet tentacles, not that I've checked since Tim's Blacknet key was factored ). There was also an alt.anonymous.messages or something along those lines. Bad propagation.
It seems to me that receiving messages through newsgroups (sent through remailernet) and having them retrieved automatically by your newsreader
might be a better method of defeating traffic analysis. Sounds like Vinge's
piece in True Names about downloading the entire world bbs. All you'd need
to do here would be to scan your local feed of alt.test .
While this would work in the short run, with a low level of users, in a high usage scenario, you'd post a destinated pseudonym (you might want it encrypted) in alt.test along with the name of the specific newsgroup the actual message would be posted to. Saves computing power.

Nah. I'll take it back. Send encrypted through usenet, receive encrypted through usenet. Best of both, but very slow and only good for voluntary mail reception. You could also have an agent doing this scanning for msgs and posting unencrypted (or send mail to an  unwitting spam victim). While it protects all but the last mailer almost completely, it's far slower than remailernet and only protects against traffic analysis.

There already is. I think the *.test (or at least alt.test) groups have good propagation. Nobody "reads" anything but their own posts anyway, so the natives wouldn't be bothered. There are some "real" (as opposed to usenet posting tests) *.test newsgroups, so you'd have to be careful about which ones you post to.
ire hierarchy for this sort of thing widely
propagated. Last year I was a prolific contributor to alt.config. At one point someone on c'punks mentioned problems in getting alt.anonymous and
alt.anonymous.messages. I hoped my good reputation in alt.config (at that
time, anyway ;) might help my call for a round of re-newgrouping to increase
the groups' propagation. But I found that I couldn't convincingly justify
their existence against the objections raised by news admins. Let me summarize the arguments I've seen against alt.anonymous.*:
1) It's a hopeless mess for readers, because messages on all imaginable topics will be jumbled together there. Messages there won't fit conveniently
into the flow of threads in other newsgroups. So anonymous messages intended
for general consumption will be pointless in alt.anonymous.*
2) In light of 1), people won't look there unless they expect a personal message from someone. So most of the traffic there will be irrelevant to nearly everyone on Usenet. 3) If it has sufficiently low bandwidth for news admins to overlook 2), it should be a mailing list.
The fundamental conflict, as I see it, is this: For security reasons, we want messages to be distributed to a very wide
audience, although those messages are only of interest to a very narrow
audience. News admins understandably are generally inclined to accept
bandwidth only in proportion to readership. For practical reasons, they don't
want to carry messages to people who aren't interested in them. It's not
easy to convince the news admins to do it anyway out of altruism.

Yeah, but you can turn them off by having "Test" in your header. I disovered this after getting my mailbox filled with those bloody auto-responses. It isn't really important since you're posting your file encrypted a second time in the first remailer's key, so the received file
will bear no resemblance to the original. And as far as wasting a lot of bandwidth is concerned, it would never be worse than the alt.binaries newsgroups.

My school's using Elementary Number Theory and Its Applications 3rd edition
(I think it is just out) by Kenneth H. Rosen, Addison-Wesley, it seems to cover a bit of crypto and the latest improvements in factoring. For more crypto orientation, Schneier recommends A Course in Number Theory and Cryptography 2nd ed, Neal Koblitz, Springer-Verlag, 1994. The intro to
number theory is more of a review, but the crypto part kicks in after page 54 and spans the rest of the book. Getting your Num Theory from Rosen
and your crypto from Koblitz is a good bet, as your local university library's likely to have both (mine had both 2nd eds, just picked 'em up as
a matter of coincidence).
Rosen seems to be one of those "standard textbooks" (we're using his Discrete
Math text too) and as for Koblitz, books by Springer have extremely high chances of turning up in universities. (It's in the yellow Grad Texts in Math
series, not the familiar silver Lecture Notes in CS series)

*Overlong and badly edited argument in underhanded support of government
anonymity follows, it gets better towards the end, feel free to skim*
Here I go again.
I mostly agree with that argument on even days and mostly disagree with it
on odd ones. The way I see it mostly depends on whether or not you believe
in organizational thermodynamics ("the center cannot hold, entropy increases...") and positive and practical uses of absolute freedom of speech (and by extension the anonymity to keep it that way).
Should government employees be "allowed" to have access to the package deal
of anonymity (and money laundering) that we are pushing?
  First you should check whether or not they already do and in what form it comes. As we've seen in (among many other things) the persecution of Phil Z.,
there definitely are the proverbial nameless bureaucrats. Is this not   FOIA filings or suits cost money, time and sanity. While you can get the odd tidbit out of this method, it is not for the faint-hearted and will not get you anything that the government wants to keep classified (except in the really odd case that it was temporarily unclassified by   If government accountability is to be based upon this disclosure method,
then it is on very shaky footing. This is anonymity, not the overt and freely
usable anonymity of the cypherpunk style, but covert anonymity, that which
is exists for an entrenched institution while giving the public impression
of not being there and justifying inadequate measures like the FOIA.
This is a form of organizational stegonography, I guess.
 Consider on the other hand if a large part of the govermental communications
infrastructure, let's say email and groupware were conducted through a remailernet or somesuch cpunk-style anonymizing scheme. Would bureaucratic secrecy get any worse? Since I am neither an active activist nor a journalist, I cannot say.   I do know that besides the natural desire of the spook agencies
to work this way, many businesses have often claimed that there are pruductivity advantages to anonymous offices communications and boardroom meetings. They tend to generate creative ideas and encourage honesty and outspokenness by those lower on the pecking order. So there are legitimate
business uses for it. The more legitimate the concept becomes, the more
people get used to it and start thinking about the advantages and the implications of not using True Names. (I realize this has been said before,
bide with me.) Think of it as grass-roots crypto vs. institutional stego.
  Legitimacy, publicity and widespread use are one thing, giving it to government is another. The argument is that if we legitimize privacy for the gov, that's the end of democracy. IMO, if you sell people on the illusion
of fourth estate power to verify gov action and render them accountable, you are living in an even more dangerous form of self-denial and willful ignorance. So far so good, nothing new. But what if there are actual benefits
to be had? If cypherpunks have some latent desire to speak freely, maybe this is a natural tendency for everyone else too.   Ottawa is the bureaucratic capital of this country. In my short stay here, the most vehement opposition to the bureaucracy and red tape I have heard has been from the fed-up bureaucrats themselves. They are the poor saps who must deal with this stupidity and waste day-in day-out. I assume the military and the spooks have it the worst (and I have heard them say just that). AFAIK this is our best constituency. Notice
that Tim, of all people, is from a government town.
  Journalists frequently get anonymous tips, the gov even occasionally pays
lip-service to setting up an anonymous whistleblowers BBS. How were books
like The Puzzle Palace written if not with inside help and off-the-record
interviews. Need I mention the Pentagon Papers? Anonymity is something the government (the organization) craves, yet allowing its employees to use
the anonymity we as cypherpunks want could be the most underhanded present possible. Not only does it entrench it (if the entire government has it, how could they ban it?) but allows individuals within it to pass on the info they please without fear of persecution. If we are ever to get, let's say, the Skipjack algorithm, this scenario is much more likely than
reverse-engineering of Clipper. This has many implications. Anonymous
government employees are IMHO a far more effective check on power than
a disinterested easy-profit oriented mainstream press and overstretched civil liberties lobbies.  Think of it as one organization with 3 million potential unions. Can anyone imagine what would have happenned if even one of the pilots during the Gulf War had been able to anonymously post a video of the carpet-bombing of Iraq or any other contradiction of official reporting? No journalist could have done this.
 The decentralizing, entropic power of masses of thinking individuals has
more power than centralized paper-shuffling court-martialing rule. The gov is already out of control, maybe it will go out of control in a different direction once the technology of free speech permits it.
 There is also very little we can do to stop anyone from using it. As Louis Freeh has discovered, once the technological genie is out of the bottle, it stays out. Should I be wrong about these positive implications, once the
code written, just as the inventors of nukes turned pacifist, the authors
of crypto software will have no control over their creation. Giving to the
public amounts to giving it to the gov. I simply prefer that it be overt rather than covert.
 I will not even go into the positively underhanded benefits of giving the gov anon digicash. The issues are the same, but even moreso. Three cheers
for capitalism.

We have a topic (or goal) of cryptography and anonymity, codewriters to give us something other than politics to talk about, a persistent random noise function to increase diversity, and Perry as a factor of noise limitation.

Actually there's a pgp-based program that lets them do that with usenet posts. It is called NoCem ("No See 'Em") and is currently used to let users
avoid spam. With spam (or crud of your choice) being defined by those posters to alt.nocem.misc whom you trust the most. You can let canceller of your choice (anyone with pgp) censor your personal newsfeed.
Unfortunately, like all things unix or command line, it is not a no-brainer for Joe Sixpack (I couldn't manage to run it on this unix system, for example.) Of course any windows or mac hack could do the same trick. Try  Bryce's proposal from last week for a cypherpunks-message cancellation list is similar. (Sorry, Bryce, I'd help out if I had the time.)
And the above system would let them do it. One could also personally assign a "weight" to each rater and have messages cancelled once a threshold was passed (this proposed in the faq, since I couldn't run it, I don't know if it currently does it).
Who says pgp's web of trust is obsolete? This is an actual application.

   He is. Stephenson's an occasional programmer and mentions a few cpunks    from Communities.com at the end of Snow Crash. He also throws in tasteful    renditions of old hat stuff like Turing machines (hardly the pinacle    of high tech processing power), and does a great job with an example    of parallel processing stolen from A Fire Upon the Deep (but *so*    much spicier!). Who would have thought sex orgies would be a model    for computation? Or ritual drumming as IPC...? I can just imagine a    unix kernel for such a machine...(or beast?)
   >2) Around these, he weaves a boring, artless plot.
   Actually the plot is rather well done and does not focus nearly as    much on tech Snow Crash did. It's more of a story-telling novel with some
   very cute literary devices. It's got to be the only children's book    I'd recommend to anyone, especially people you'd like to interest in    basic CS concepts or crypto-anonymity issues and who wouldn't be     caught dead reading sci-fi, much less cyberpunk. I don't consider it    to be a thriller (though it has more sex and violence than your average
   kid's book.). It was even a bit sentimental.
   Those of you who enjoy conclusive story resolution, will not like    Stephenson's open-ended finale (though *I* think he got it right    this time, unlike in Snow Crash).
   It has me wondering was what a real "Young Lady's Primer" complete with    gentle cartoonesque intros to CS, crypto (recreational crypto maybe?)    and chaumian concepts would invlolve. I do remember Phil Z. mentioning on    the list that his original exposure to crypto was as a child by just    such a book (he announced this the day the author died). I have heard of the    occasional video game that teaches assembler or typing, it might be    interesting to create and release such a thing on the net for the topics
