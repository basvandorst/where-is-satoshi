@_subject: CRC-32 forger? 
Does anyone know of an existing tool to forge a CRC-32 fingerprint?  Meaning I can record the sig, edit the file, and then get this program to pad the file with junk to make an identical sig?  I know this is a pretty easy thing to do, but I'm looking for a tool so that I can say "there are already existing tools to do this".
