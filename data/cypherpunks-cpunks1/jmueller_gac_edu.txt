Maybe someone should mail the Constitution to president at whitehouse.gov -
just to make sure he hasn't forgotten.

Could anyone tell me, is it true that PGP 2.3 was watered down to
appease the RSA folks?  If so, would it be a better idea to use 2.2?  Thanks.

I know you are looking for legal advice, but the idea of some stiff trying
to stop a communication at the "border" just seemed rather ludicrous to
me.  Somehow I don't think he'll have much luck imposing national
boundaries on cyberspace, which has no borders, save those of private,
individual systems.  Once something is on the net, they'd do better of
thinking of it as instantly being everywhere, rather than beating their
heads against the wall with old, hidebound ideas of restricting the flow
of information.

It's just occurred to me - say that all the petitions against clipper are
ignored, clipper becomes mandatory, and other methods of encryption are
outlawed, and clipper gets a user base of several million.  One
well-placed explosive device that destroys even one of the two escrow
databases, and suddenly the government has supplied us with
secure encryption that even they can't break.      Of course, that is assuming that the government didn't lie and make extra backup copies (just for safety's sake, you understand, against just
such a threat) that are kept somewhere out of public scrutiny, so that
wiretaps can be made on a large scale without alarming people monitoring
the access of the "official" database.  Say all this happens.  Maybe the
government will even be the one to rig the explosion.  Suddenly people lose
all their reservations about using Clipper products.  The government
decides to give up escrowing keys (officially).  But they can still listen
in everywhere, and people won't be guarded.
    That first paragraph is also assuming that they didn't build in a back
door to the encryption system.  But then essentially the same scenario
would apply.

@_subject: Vernor Vinge info... 
This may or may not have been already mentioned, but I've noticed that
Vernor Vinge will be the Guest of Honor at this year's Minicon Science
Fiction convention in Minneapolis, MN over easter weekend.  I'm planning
on going, and was just wondering if anyone here had anything in particular
they'd like me to ask him, should I get the chance to talk to him
(considering that I know quite well the chairman of last year's Minicon,
this is distinctly possible).  If anyone would like to attend, memberships
are $25 until February 14, then $55 after that and at the door.  Contact
me for further info if you're interested.
