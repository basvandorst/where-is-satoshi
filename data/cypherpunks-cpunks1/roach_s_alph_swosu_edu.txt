If I remember my history right, the order that math was done often depended
on the model of calculator it was done on.  I remember being warned as late
as 1991 how some calculators may still still add before they multiply, and
to use those parenthesis for good measure, just to be safe.
I know where there used to be a basic model slide rule that spans about 10
feet, it was mounted on the wall of the math room where I spent junior high.
My dad actually taught me basic arithemetic on it.  (Ironically, on the
opposite wall were the computers, an Apple IIe, a Commodore 64, two
TI99/4a's and about 4 Tandy 1000/tx's, this did all take place before 1989)

At first I was afraid to comment, as I have been more than vocal in the last
24 hours, but then I decided that I thought this important enough to bring up.
This was the first time on this list that I noticed such an obvious
reference to race, granted I'm fairly new to the list,(quite new in fact),
and when I think about it, there were several references to Russians and
Jews in some of the other posts about Dr. Vulis and his practices.  In my
rose colored view, I had not taken notice, possibly because they were
comments about the statements made by an individual, more likely because I'm
gratefully ignorant to most of the filth of this imperfect world.  I was
unaware of some of the hardships some of my friends and their friends still
go through just because of their skin color.  Not Just with recognized,
individual bigots, but also with the police, and I live in a sparsely
populated area.
The point I was going to make was that this comment caught my eye, because
it bridged my real, though I should say corporal as this is quite real,
world with my online world.  For a week there, I was a individual in a
society of minds, our "race" depended on our individual views.  I like being
online, I am judged by what I think matters.  When something threatens my
ability to be free of the definitions put on my physical shell, I react.
Does this have any relation to crypto?  No  But it does have relevance to
anonymity.  Online I can be who I feel like, not what I look like.
For those wondering who I am, I may be an AI painted purple with a big intel
sticker on my side, it doesn't matter, what do you think about my ideas.

However, those armed thugs would come up with a bunch of public keys with no
names attached.  These keys could be used to check that "person X's" e-mail
was h[er,is] own but never know who was attached to that signature.  Also,
complaints could use that signature to close down the account, so that
"person X" could no longer send.  Of course, this would not prevent that
individual from resubscribing, (what would, if you figure that out, apply it
to Dr. Vulis), it would allow for the remailer to be used without the fear
of the government confiscating the names of the individuals.  The only thing
I can think of that I don't have a solution for, note this is just what I've
thought of, is the sting, where the government would take over the remailer
and let it continue to operate, but logging the return posts.
This could work simply for mailing lists, such as this one, where the sender
could verify that the message got there in person, and receive h[er,is]
responses straight from the same list.  For private mail, the person would
have to submit to being a part of a group of approximately 100 others, with
all of the posts put in a newsgroup which would be downloaded in mass.
Anyone watching for downloads would only see that the person was one of
one-hundred who might have made that post.  All of the posts could be
encrypted with the key in plaintext for easy filtering.  No need to attempt
to decipher everyone's mail just to see what was for you.  This would be
akin to stopping by a bullitan board in a hospital to find out what the test
results were.  Anyone could see that you were there, but they wouldn't even
know what type of test you were in for, be it a blood-sugar test, a chemical
analysis, an X-ray or veneral-desease test.  All they would be able to tell
was that you're patient number was on that wall somewhere.
Persons wanting more security could download the entire contents of several
newsgroups straight to the screen while they were going to the fridge for a
soda.  Akin to visiting several bulletin boards to cover which post you were at.
Granted, the second idea is less secure than the mailing list one, but could
be made to work.  In the hospital, you could send a friend in for the check,
on the net, you could have a daemon remail the newsgroups for you and then
self destruct.  You could always keep a copy of the daemon on your hard
drive, and use multiple telnet sites to do the job.

This may prove my ignorance, but I thought that the WebTV systems were going
to use a propiatory service.  I am assuming that this is true in this post.
If the WebTV product is using a propietory ISP for its operation, I assume
that WebTV sets sold outside of the United States will not be dialing up the
same phone number.  As the chip could easily communicate with the ISP, and
the ISP communicate, perhaps through standard credit validation systems,
with the merchants, why does the international version even need U.S.
developed encryption.  The international version could most likely be fitted
with the locally available strong encryption.  Since the WebTV ISP will
probably have a virtually private wide area network, the "foreign"
encryption could be replaced with a more standard type inside of the U.S.,
at the main offices.  Why give the U.S. government the ability to look at
the transaction information of non-U.S. citizens, off of U.S. soil.
If, however, the WebTV system does not have the ability to maintain contact
with its over-seas offices, this could be unfeasable.
Granted, this idea would mean that some computer would have access to all of
the relevant data,for the purpose of "trading" crypto, but I would rather
put my trust in a company, which I could easily quit dealing with, than the
U.S. government, which might easily institute an international sales tax system.
Can PGP be compiled to an EEPROM?  If so, PGP is well distributed and might
easily be accepted for online transactions, also, Mr. Zimmerman might be
willing to agree to a bulk liscense sale for the implemention of this idea.

Cypherpunks try to break each others crypto as well, in an attempt to evolve

it.  Of course, I just assume that those on the list are who they say they

I found the paperback in a school library and found that it said that the

I cannot say that I read the whole text, only the first half chapter and
then some skipping around trying to find the RSA algorthim.  I later found

@_subject: Mass-market crypto phones 
At first this seemed to be a challenging goal as public key encryption (at
least the type of which I am aware) requires a public key ring, but then I
thought, what would be the point in real time communitation?
Here is my idea.
The initiating phone sends a public key to the receiving phone.
The receiving phone takes this public key and uses it to prepare the session
key, or perhaps both session keys (one key for each simples circuit), as in PGP.
Both boxes would need to have hybrid circuits in them like the telephone
company uses to filter out the incoming signal from the outgoing signal.
The telephone amplifiers only amplify half of the signal, so it basically
consists of two simplex circuits from the local trunk to the other trunks.
This could be bypassed if the device set between the base and the handset.
Best would be to have the hybrid circuit so that it could work with the more
basic models.
I can only see two problems.
The first problem I can see right now would be randomization, (line noise
sampling?, hold the microphone close to a radio playing static until the LED
starts flashing?)
The second challenge would be getting public key encryption to work with an
analog system.  The device will have to have two analog to digital
converters and two digital to analog converters.  I believe that the
telephone operates with a carrier of about 3000 Hz, thus the box will
probably need to maintain a sampling rate of 1500 Hz or less, if this
frequency will carry voice.  The system will probably need some form of
run-time compression built in as well as sample voice at a low bit depth.
The result, under ideal circumstances will probably be a tinny sound and
loss of fidelity.
The D-A, A-D pair on the telco side could be replaced by a good modem, this
would eliminate some of the problems of the RBOC filters cutting out the
"noise" which would really be signal.
If you set the sampleing rate at 3000 cycles per second, by 8 bits of depth,
you would need to be able to transmit clearly 3000 * 8 bits per second or
24000 bits per second.  That would be 24 KiloBITS per second, about 1/8th
the 28.8 KiloBYTE modems that are commond today.  A 3000 baud modem should
be both cheap and easy to pack into a small package.  This would probably
allow for no compression at 8 bits of sampling depth.
So, the block diagram would be as follows.
                ________________     _______________     ___________
              | --> |             | --> |         |  Line
to       |
 Line from RBOC | 3000+ Baud   |-----| Public Key  |-----|A-D /D-A |
Telephone     |
----------------| Full Duplex  |     | Encryption  |     |  Pair
   <--->        | Modem        |-----| Layer       |-----|         |
<--->       |
______________| <-- |_____________| <-- |_________|
I was thinking that the device could be built into a case about the same
size as a modem or answering machine, possibly a little taller to accomidate
the modem circuit, should a full duplex modem replace the telco end A-D, D-A
Unfortunately, I have very little experience with circuits.  I can't even
draw out an asyncronis multivibrator right now.  (That is a square wave
generator involving 2 transistors, 4 resistors, and 2 capicitors, not a toy
based around a motor with an off center weight)
P.S. The line on the far right is for alignment, If this line is crooked,
copy and paste the diagram to a standard ASCII editor.  this should
eliminate the pipes and spaces from being shorter than every thing else.

Relax, bandwidth is limited, all transactions over certain amounts and in
certain areas have been logged for a long time, these will continue to be
logged.  Records made on the chip will probably have a shorter life than the
memories of those people present, still admissible in court.  Because the
computers logging the details, either on site or at the finantial
institution, have limited storage capacity, less useful data will be
continuously overwritten by more current data.  On site, this may be
nightly, at the bank, possibly weakly, maybe even monthly.  All records,
except those already logged, will have a fairly short halflife, this will be
especially true of locations which enjoy heavy traffic.  As for the "smart
card", it will have a half life as well, especially if you purposely flood
it.  Go to the ATM with the lowest rates, 0 if possible.  Pick one heavily
visited, the nearest to a coin-op laundry would have a particular poetic
justice to it, and transfer funds back and forth for several cycles to
overwrite the data on the card.  Suddenly, the card has been through too
many transactions to recall what happened 500 transactions back.  Someone
with experience with the technology might also modify an electronic wallet
to blank transaction records, this could be as basic as transferring funds
repeatedly between two cards.

I got something very similar from a friend who is much higher on the

big fair/trade-show/political rally that everyone attended.  Once a year I
think.  That in addition to stopping by three houses to report the killing
the killer had to report it at the next of these events to occur.  It was
also suggested that the compensation was a fairly fixed amount but that a
person who could afford it and really didn't want trouble from the heirs of
the deceased could pay more, thus suggesting that he considered the deceased
to be more valuable than the average man.  Sort of a post-mortem complement
by the killer.
Also, according to what I remember, the "protection company" was your
extended family.  Pay up or face the wraith of all the deceased's cousins,
nephews, uncles, neices, aunts, maybe his kids.
I would love to get more information on this, however, the friend who told

would be forced do deal with a more powerful curse.  Insurance companies
would be reconfigured to anonymously see to the death of whatever caused the
death of thier clients.  They would make money because if the death could be
ruled accidental, they would not have to pay.  If the person died of a heart
attack, and the food taster didn't, (the food taster would probably be the
cooks son by the way), then the bond that the tyrant had with the company
would be void.  The company would cash the check.  If the tyrant wanted to

different companies, each with a signature amount to give to the executors

them politically, and the U.N., of which they were a member.  End of source
Even those who oppose the taxes would be forced to pay as it would be the
army that would be collecting.  Then they could take the remaining monies
that they had to target the leaders, who would use the tax revinues to
protect themselves.  If more money was needed, nore taxes would be collected.
If it were a private corporation, the wages of the workers would be reduced
on occassion to pay for the different security systems of the owner.  Additionally, under our current system, the assassin would have his day in
court, perhaps he could escape the government, making the cost-benefit
analysis skewed in favor of crime.  Under a system as proposed, the assassin
would be forced do deal with a more powerful curse.  Insurance companies
would be reconfigured to anonymously see to the death of whatever caused the
death of thier clients.  They would make money because if the death could be
ruled accidental, they would not have to pay.  If the person died of a heart
attack, and the food taster didn't, (the food taster would probably be the
cooks son by the way), then the bond that the tyrant had with the company
would be void.  The company would cash the check.  If the tyrant wanted to
insure h[is/er] survival, (s)he would take out several of these bonds, with
different companies, each with a signature amount to give to the executors
to check their loyalty.  If the company paying 1295065 dollars didn't pay
up, the executors would tell the world.
The idea is, where a layer can be subverted, duplicate the layer so that at
least one element is bound to work.

Let's not tempt them with something that the common person on the street
would consider computer media, I.E. punched cards and dataglyphs.  Remember
the old fonts that used to be everywhere?  The ones with the thickened
letters at key places?  Look at a check some time, that is the type of font
at the bottom, its designed to be readable by both man and machine.  Print
out the source code in one of those fonts and mail that.  This is not as
data intensive as the other way, but at least it can be argued that it can
be read by an unaided person.
That way, on the other end, the text can be scanned in directly, using a
modified form of check clearing software, and converted into electronic
media, sans errors.

This time I have opted for a point by point.
This point I can not argue with, at least not directly.  I do believe that
the military way is wasteful of resources.  However, this is one area that
has actually benefitted the lower-income bracket in that it gives them
"inexpensive" (off-chance of death) access to good training.
Three things that promote technological growth, expansion, war, threat of war.
As for expansion. we really have no where else to go.  As for war and threat
of war, the computer was invented during a war, atomic energy was harnessed
during war, the internet was created during threat of war.  Many
advancements, though not all, come to benefit society later.  For that
matter, steel was probably invented during a war as well, but I can't prove it.
The patent system gives the innovator a reward for ingenuity, that person
can decide what to do with the invention for a short period of time, after
which it becomes available to all.  (BTW I really think that computer code
should be copyrighted and not patented, this allows others to reproduce the
work independantly without repercussions, gives the necessary protection,
makes it more obviously a form of speech.)
To this I can't argue, business is certainly leaner than government.  Of
course most desert plants are more robust than their resource-wasteful
wetland counterpart.  Where there is a near-bottomless supply of material,
as in taxes, true streamlining really doesn't happen.  Remember, the
automobile really didn't become anywhere near fuel-efficient until after the
energy crisis.
As it is, the "A" group, that's not us, is being promoted with virtually all
of the capitol, the "B" group, us, is being attacked in policy and attempts
are being made to keep us from getting any bigger.

What about totally uncentralized.  Instead of using a system like
majordomo.com, each person maintain a list of "subscribers", I would be
willing to at least attempt to be one lightening rod for "subscriptions".
Since I am using the schools machine to read the list, and I don't have any
extra priveledge, I would have to do it manually and might quickly stop, but
I would be willing to try.
In this way, everyone is moderately censored by the processor time expended
in mailing a message CC:'d to everyone, but no one could effectively do any
type of blocking of the list.
Those acting in the place of majordomo could regularly trade lists for
alphabetization, (so that the lists should be identical), and file comparing.
This list could then be sent to anyone who wanted to be a "subscriber" so
that they could post as well.
A more effective way would be to have the distributed list as previously
discussed, or even maintain one account or web-page to hold the names, but I
can't help with that.
Just an idea.
One small problem, with such a list, advertisers may feel less obligated to
follow standard rules of ettiquite.  They may feel that the list is even
more "open season" than they as a group feel now.
I hope that everyone will post to this thread as I would like to be able to
"fall in" with the majority decision.  To do that, there needs to BE a
majority decision.

You might want to set up a temporary majordomo on the same machine as one of
the permanent daemons for debugging purposes.  It is conceivable to me that
a message might be sent to one sub-list, be forewarded to two lists, and
then each of those foreward the same message to each other, causing duplication.
You might get around this if the daemons keep track of each others, unique,
message ID numbers.
In other words, if each unit were to apend the message ID with a personal ID
number when the message came from someone other than a majordomo, then they
could collate them by number, eliminate duplications, and send them on down
the line.
To do this, the majordomo daemons will probably have to have a guaranteed
seat in the front of the cue.
This is probably a stupid point to bring up as you have probably already
cured this problem, but I decided to post it anyway.

Here is another idea.
The merchant and customer agree on a price, with the merchant knowing that
the "bank" will take a cut for their services.
The merchant and customer both LOG IN to the bank seperately, each type in
their agreed upon price and cut & paste in the services rendered
information.  If they match, the bank makes the necessary transaction
between the accounts, e-cash stash, etc.  The bank also supplies both
parties with a clear signed receipt.  The bank can now no longer alter the
receipt, as the merchant and customer both have a copy.  And the customer
and merchant can not alter the receipt, because then it would fail the test
on the signature.
If a receipt for a transaction number were used, then the only threat would
be the same one that exists for remailer operators.  This could be negated
by daisy-chaining banks in a similair manner.  If each bank took a cut of
non-customers of $.0002 or .02% of the transaction, whichever was greater,
then a suitable system could be set up.
Another idea that has been festering.  If we could get a CPA involved in
this forum, I would be willing to have h[im/er] sign my key, (which is
seldom used, mostly because this is the only place I use e-mail), for that
reasonable fee that CPA's can charge.  I know that it is not a standard, or
even legally recognized, post for CPA's, but I think that enough people
would trust them.
This would take care of some of the "newly minted" key problems.  Since
getting someone who is trusted to sign your key is a recognized method of
getting people to believe you are who you say you are.  Just an idea.

from a ring, the messages that need to travel across that ring can no longer
do that.  This makes the loop only as strong as its most at risk remailer.
The star approach has already been seen in action, the trouble here is a

Full interconnectability is only feasible in a small net, but I would advise
this at first.  Check for the x-loop to see if another one got it first.  If
none, add one and send it on down the line.
A disjointed mess, if the remailers are given first access to the list,

As far as I am aware, a CPA is supposed to require a photo ID.  Since this
is the method by which absentee voting is accomplished.  A supposedly
anonymous system, (using two envelopes, the postmaster only knows that you
voted, the vote counter only knows that it came by mail, the public only
knows how many people are absentee voters, and who, the voter assumes that
the system works), requiring the CPA as a witness to the identity of the voter.
The problem would be getting the public to recognize the CPA as a key
signing authority.  This would presumably require a public announcement, the
backing of existing trusted users, etc.
Personally, I think that the netherlands? toying around with the post office
would be ideal for keys used solely for signing.  I just wouldn't trust the
government to have access to the one I used for encryption.
Maybe that's a better idea.  Let's all use a government accessable key for
signing, making it as long as possible to reduce identity theft.  And use
homebrew, super encryption for the actual secrecy.  Let GAK be our CPA.

@_subject: MULTI-JURISDICTIONAL TAXATION OF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE 
"Toll" tax.
If each packet were "taxed" as it entered a system, and due to the nature of
the internet, when traffic increases in certain areas, prices would go up,
driving activity back down, then each area could "tax" what it wanted.
The only real problem would be how to get people to pay.  Unlike the toll
booth at the entrance to a turnpike, internet users don't keep exact change.
There is no window to roll down to hand the attendant the money, there is no
accepted currency to hand the attendant either.
Taxation can't really begin until e-cash equipped browsers are common.
Plus, executables are fairly large, while text files tend to be small,
adding a bias against executables, images, and audio files.
In addition, since the packets have to originate from somewhere, the
location of the poster would get to tax at least.
Of course, if such a system were not mandatory in a region, then "freenets"
would get a whole new meaning.

So instead of all of the keys being stored in some guarded vault, the parent
key which each chip uses to encrypt part of the users key when transmitting
is kept in some guarded vault.
That way they get the key in some 10 messages unless you rotate often.
Or the keys are assigned according to some unusual system.  Assuming that
only 10,000,000 people were interested in the cards, then only 2^24 keys, or
16777216 keys need to be assigned.  An additional 100+ bits of "key" can be
thrown in, so long as the government has those, or can reconstruct them from
the others.
If you can only affect part of the key, can't a brute force attack get you,
knowing that certain random digits were always the same?
Of course this would become too obvious really soon, unless some elaborate
system were used to rotate the garbage.  such as having bits 2, 5, 9, 11,
12, 14, and 19 tell which of 128 different garbage sets to throw in.
Please correct me if this is unfounded.
Please inform me if I'm on the right track.

I understand that freedom of speech is a basic right, and I understand the

the signal to noise ratio is higher.
I also subscribe to the idea that in a forum where only speech is possible,
a persons use of that speech is the representation of that person.  (Not
that it never is otherwise.)
What I'm trying to get at is, when does freedom of speech in a "speech only"
environment" become soliciting?  To me, though it is only my opinion, it
seems that a telemarketer wishing to offer wares to a group on a mailing
list should get permission from the lists maintainer.  I apologize if this
is already the case, as my accusations would be pointless.
To me, it seems to be a breach of conduct for a company to use a mailing
list that is not thier own as a mass mailing technique.

@_subject: Airport security [no such thing] 
So, to successfully place a "package" on an international flight, take a
connecting flight that hooks up at the same terminal.  Go to your local "has
no x-ray, doing well to have a metal detector" airstrip and take a flight on
one of the commuter flights such as Eagle, (this way you might be lucky
enough to enter the next, probably major airport, in the same terminal as
some international flights.)  Now, its presumed that you have already been
searched at your last stop because you're already in the secured area.
Such a plan would require multiple stops and homework into the layout of the
airports (to know which airlines share the same terminals).
Also, the bag would have to be a carry-on, otherwise the dogs would get it.
BTW, the package could be just about anything, including chemicals, sarin,
TNT, artifacts, human tissue, or anything else with export controls and
being a physical substance.
This post is not meant to suggest ways of breaking state, federal, or
international laws.  Merely to point out the weaknesses of the system as it
stands.  If the airport network was a computer network, it would be
compromized inside of 48 hours.  All because the level of trust between
airports defaults to full.

There are currently on the market, phones specifically designed to modify
the voice of the user so that kids can answer as adults, women can answer as

There are currently on the market keyboards that allow you to sample some
real world sound and use it as a voice in your music, (the model I saw, a

achieve this.)
I have thought, if a machine were to take the incoming voice, analize
(apologies for spelling) it to get a spectrum signature, a pattern that can
be added or subtracted from another, and could then add the difference
between that and the victims signature to the users voice, then real-time,
on-the-fly con jobs would be easy.
The only thing that the user would be responsible for would be the accent,

I believe that I heard a suggestion here once involving accepting Vulis's
posts, all of them, but only distributing them to Vulis.
I have also heard, on a web-based bulliten board (please excuse the
spelling), about setting up a proxy for the CDA supporters routing all of
thier requests to a VAX loaded with only "clean" stuff, either by
engineering it for them, or routing all of thier communications to an
existing "clean" site.
The idea here is, if the government doesn't know what sites to block, i.e.
thier in office checks of said site checked out but everyone gets a
different look, they can't block them.  To begin blocking proxies, they
would have to get spies in the population to tell them where the "trash" is,
or pay a bounty for every such site, which they would then have to figure
out how to verify.  This would require spies on our part as well.  Ones to
say that so-and-so citizen has been informing to the government so that the
operators could put that citizen on the government list, the list of people
to give the filtered "wholesome" feed to.
Such an effort would require a great amount of effort and would probably be
best suited to the EFF or other existing freedom protection organization.
The setup would be similair to a "pirate broadcast" in the views of the
government and would thus be best operated from safe shores.
The spy ring would be simple.
A e-mail address or other semi-secure drop-off point would be maintained for
snitches.  This address would be well advertised on the board, a SINGLE system.
When a tattler is fingered by a fellow tattler, the government side tattler
is baited with highly inflammatory, but mostly worthless, articles about the
government.  If the site is blocked, the informer is blocked.
There are several kinks to work out.
The single site would be easier to maintain, having "disposible" repeater
sites which the government can see to block.  Thus the main site would never
be seen unshielded, though if it was, it wouldn't mean anything.

This may be true, but the example was to show how easy a defensive line
could be thrown up around the powerful.  For example, conventional body
guards could be included, ones with no real pay but with the fore knowledge
that they will be buried with the tyrant.  These body guards could be ten
children out of each local village.  Merely a human shield.  In an attack,
they would scatter, but the parents would know that the children would die
if a successful action were taken against the tyrant.  Also, the tyrant
could put an open bounty on anyone caught trying to harm him.  Just bring
the decapitated head of the assassin along with a VHS cassette of the
attempted action for a big reward.  By layering the defenses, it becomes increasingly difficult for anyone to
get through.
Obviously the castles walls are the first line of defense, so a reward is
given for anyone caught using any entrance to the fortress except those that
are provided.
The household is told that their participation will result in the
extermination of their families.  They are then told that if they know of an
impending action and fail to report it or attempt to stop it, they are
considered party it those actions.
A human shield of innocents is "given the privaledge to live in the fortress
with our great leader" so that actions by concerned parties is limited further.
A standing bounty is placed on the head of the assassin, who so ever brings
in the head of the assassin and all children parented by that person after
the assination will be given a reward of some set sum.  Probably 110%.
A bounty is set on security breaches, this bounty would probably be 110% of
the death mark on the tyrant.
A series of more conventional boobytraps are layed in normally inaccessable
areas, the layers of these either being prisoners who have unknowningly been
condemned to die, the tyrant himself, or some other disposable or trustable
deployment device.  The most common of these would probably be a mine field
between the two outer most walls of the fortress, and maybe a funnel-gun
parimeter inside of that.
An inner sanctum with self contained air, water, and food is maintained for
the tyrant and h[is/er] closest relatives/advisors.  This sanctum would be
accessed by biometrics and only used in a percieved emergency.
All dissent is declared illegal with capitol punishment for the mere
discussion of the impending death of the tyrant, exceptions to this would be
persons in the direct company of the tyrant with the tyrants full awareness,
and permission.

Obviously the castles walls are the first line of defense, so a reward is
given for anyone caught using any entrance to the fortress except those that
are provided.
The household is told that their participation will result in the
extermination of their families.  They are then told that if they know of an
impending action and fail to report it or attempt to stop it, they are
considered party it those actions.
A human shield of innocents is "given the privaledge to live in the fortress
with our great leader" so that actions by concerned parties is limited further.
A standing bounty is placed on the head of the assassin, who so ever brings
in the head of the assassin and all children parented by that person after
the assination will be given a reward of some set sum.  Probably 110%.
A bounty is set on security breaches, this bounty would probably be 110% of
the death mark on the tyrant.
A series of more conventional boobytraps are layed in normally inaccessable
areas, the layers of these either being prisoners who have unknowningly been
condemned to die, the tyrant himself, or some other disposable or trustable
deployment device.  The most common of these would probably be a mine field
between the two outer most walls of the fortress, and maybe a funnel-gun
parimeter inside of that.
An inner sanctum with self contained air, water, and food is maintained for
the tyrant and h[is/er] closest relatives/advisors.  This sanctum would be
accessed by biometrics and only used in a percieved emergency.
All dissent is declared illegal with capitol punishment for the mere
discussion of the impending death of the tyrant, exceptions to this would be
persons in the direct company of the tyrant with the tyrants full awareness,
and permission.

The above paragraph would be a problem, unless you wanted to update the
program with a great regualrity.  Each time the offending government got the
software and blocked all of those sites, the software would be worthless.
This would be no big deal if you could guarantee some means of someone
getting the software, which would certainly be illegal, again and again.
Better to have the user key in the proxy that h[is/er] cousin/uncle/best
friend/boss/client/guest told h[im/er] about.
Here is a similar idea.  Have your plug-in replace the part of Netscape that
checks the URL with INTERNIC or similar.  Have the system accept your
address for the proxy and send the requested URL to it, the server then
FTP's the contents of the page (and if server time is readily available, its
sub-pages), places them in a temporary directory on itself and allows your
computer to see it there thinking that it is on a totally different machine.
This way the proxy owner would not have to stay on top of the latest
restricted material.
The main problem would be that the system would absorb twice as much time,
once for the download to itself, and once to show it to you.
This is not terribly different to Netscape's caching of recently visited
pages in memory on the off-chance that you will return.
If you changed passwords at the same time that you changed addresses, and
reported them together, the government wouldn't be able to keep up.
When the government did its sweep of objectionable words, it would come to
this site that would have no such data.  Only by having the access password,
would they be able to reveal that site as a proxy.  If they knew the
password then they would already know that that was a proxy site because
they would have been given both the password and the address at the same time.
You then try to maintain several different addressess at a time, each with a
different password.  As the Government blocks one, change its password and
its address.
The software would be either two-piece, assuming a dedicated client plug-in,
or one-piece.
The pieces would be as follows.
The proxy, this software would be as small as possible and would only be a
front end.  Ideally this software should fit on one 3.5" disk.  The address
to this machine would be the address handed out.  In the one-part scenario,
this would be implemented as a web-page with a CGI script for the address.
The user types in the request and this bot fetches it, placing it in a
special directory for the use of this script, this directory would probably
be erased after the allotted space was filled, though not before, (you don't
stay logged in to the remote machine when using Netscape so erasing on
hang-up would mean continually reloading the data.)  The proxy would then
refresh your client with the requested information.  In the two piece
scenario, this proxy would interact with the plug-in in much the same way,
forgoing the CGI script.
The client, the plug-in, if present, would take over the Location field and
have a set up menu to type in the proxy's URL and password.  In that way the
user would see h[im/er]self as accessing the web page directly.  Certainly
more user friendly, once the client were configured, though not quite as
flexible.  In this system the government could make both accessing the proxy
and possession of the client illegal.  It would also be a problem for
persons who use a machine to which they have no control.  If the setup were
un changeable or reset after power-down, this system would require the user
to continually re set up the client.
The proxy could be as simple as an opening screen with a field for the
password and the URL.  The proxy should re-link all external links into its
own system so that the system can be transparent after the initial page.  In
other words, the links should be replaced with a second HTML document with
the password and search-criteria inside in much the same way that
search-engines relay your request to itself, in the URL.  This would be a
simple script that changed all occurances of "A
HREF="HTTP://This.is.the/real/site.html"" to "A

As I stated in the bottom, the children would be privaledged.  They would
merely be told that it is a great honor.  It could very well be.  Assuming
that the tyrant did not die, these children would live in comparable luxery.
They would be at risk only if the tyrant was.  By keeping the children at
hand, the parents would balk at taking action against the tyrant, not only
their own action, but also that of others.  The children would merely be
there to thwart the attempts of others.
The "Tiger Teams" would have to get through security on their own, takers on
this offer would be very few unless the bounty were great, the defenses were
weak, or the thrill level were high.  An encounter with a bloodless thrill
seaker might go like this "I hacked your system, here's proof, now pay up",
remember, for some, it is the proof that a thing can be done that is the
greatest thrill.  Also, the tyrant would feel bound to keep h[is/er] word to
avoid others deciding to take the challenge for the smaller sum.
Remember also that 10% controls 90%, this means that each potential tyrant
has on average 9% of the wealth, while the remaining 90% has about 1/90th of
the remaining 10%.  To match the wealth of the tyrant, these people would
have to get together 90% of their numbers and commit everything.
If 100 people were in the total population, and 1000 dollars in circulation,
10 people would be tyrants with about 90 dollars apiece, the remaining 90
people would each have 100/90 dollars, or 1.11 dollars each.  It would take
81 of them together to match the wealth of one.  With that many, they might
as well attack outright because they would now include practically all of
the population.  If the tyrant had more than 9 of the peasants close to him,
he would be at risk by conventional means.
The real threat would not be the people, of limited means, using the system.
But rather other tyrants using the system.

The barter economy has predated the artificial construct that we know as money.
It even predates the use of precious metals, which are pretty worthless for
most uses.
Get some non bank supporters to accept "coupons" for thier merchandise.  At
first, this could easily be information based.  Make the "coupons" work on
all of this initial merchandise, which can be sold again and again, so
there's no great loss to the supporters.  Granted, this brings us back to a
form of money, but one based on commodies as opposed to worthless yellow
metal that is only sought after because it doesn't corrode and is soft
enough to work, (ignoring electronics, dental, and stained glass as more
recent developments for the shiny stuff.)
If PGP could be registered with a certain amount of these units, the same
with other crypto applications, all the better.  If people want this money,
they can call up their friendly neighborhood software salesman and buy it
knowing full well that if they ever want to, they can always trade it back
for a good "DOOM97 Hell Freezes Over" game.
They can take these signed DoomDollars to a moneychanger web site to change

Another consideration is the government spin doctor.
With the Oklahoma City federal Building Bombing, the government had a new

This bad guy was the mostly Anglo-Saxon Militant Extreme Right-Wingers.
By tying this group to the bombing, something that in many peoples opinion
they did perfectly.  They assured that people wouldn't associate with them,
and would prosecute them for any little thing.
They immediately tied these groups with gun ownership.  They also tied these
groups with white supremism.
Now if you own a gun, you must be a racist and a militia member, if your white.
If your black, you are already figured as a drug dealer, another bogeyman,
so they had that base covered.
By tying crypto into the same militia movement.  Not hard since several

all be racists because everyone knows that militia members are all racist,

Is this just a way of forcing those who take this special treatment to bow
to additional government restrictions?  An action which they would have to
do as if they didn't, a competitor might get the inventors idea patented
before the inventor?
Sounds more like a manner to place certain inventions that are crucial to
"national security" under tighter regulations.
How long before they expand the definition?  Because, if they impose
additional contractual conditions upon the advanced patent, this could mean
that crypto could be regulated constitutionally in the future by regulating
who the inventor could share it with.

The version that I read was that the truck was merely parked next to a
pillar hoping that that would do it.
The guys weren't physics majors.  With enough people here who speak in pure
math, there might be a few who could calculate the best spot for such a
device based on blueprints of the building.
My opinion, one place the charges primarily along one side.  The north one.
That way, when the columns give, the building falls on more of Manhattin.
BOOM!  Timberrr..
This is speculation, of course.  Purely for academic consideration and all that.

1,300 engineers, and take years. Developing biological weapons could cost
less than $100,000, require five biologists, and take just a few weeks,
using equipment that is readily available almost anywhere in the world."

and around the house, but considering the way the government and media can
characterize any assortment of household items or literature a question
arises - If you have meat in your refrigerator do you in fact have the basis
for a biological weapon of mass destruction? The fact that many foods can be
readily converted (by improper handling or outright negligence) to poisons
can beg the question of whether having food in your posession does not
constitute a health hazard to your children. AND we all know that the well
being of one child is what it is all about. Don't we? Don't disregard them too quickly.
I can't remember the name of the fungus, or the toxin extracted from it,
(and my science and technology encyclopedias are 2 hours away), but there is
a common fungus found in soil.  This is the stuff that can survive high temp
IF memory serves, it's botulism, that is no guarantee.
Anyway, this toxin was listed in the text that I have access to as being one
of the strongest known to man.
And it is literally under your feet.
Of course I don't know how to distill it, but I could probably make some

What? And have another Juy Falkes Disaster?
One of Guy Falkes co-conspirators warned a parlament member who happened to
be Catholic to stay clear on the appointed day, that is how word got out.
You would feel compelled to tell your closest friends.  Who would, if they
didn't just blab outright, tell others that they might want to leave.
Ultimately, someone who dates a congressional aide will tell the aide, who
having a certain loyalty to the congressperson would warn the
congressperson, etc...
No, it's best that you die.
But at least you'll die a martyr.

Radio Shack.  It's called a FM Wireless Microphone.
You can probably get one for less than 20 bucks.
You can then take the shell off of this, probably a little black rectangle
or a childs toy microphone, and you will have a nie little circuit board.
Battery life is a problem, but you can work out a solution to that depending
on where you put it.
Hide it either on the underside of surfaces below eye level or on the top
surfaces of objects a foot or so above head level.
They sell some more dedicated hardware out of the back of magazines like
popular science and popular mechanics.  Look for advertisements that claim
that thier product can BROADCAST UP TO A HALF MILE and show a picture of
something next to a quarter.

@_subject: Biological Warfare 
I came up with an idea for fighting GAK.  Biological warefare.
This is a tried and true formula for war.
The Europeans used it to great effect against the Native Americans in the
form of Rabies and Smallpoxs.
The Europeans even used a form of it even earlier, throwing the rotting
corpses of dead horses into beseiged cities to spread desease.
The more modern chemical warefare has been used in both world wars and
possibly by Saddam Hussain during the Gulf War.
What I propose is a virus.
For GAK to work, there have to be lines of code in the encryption program to
give the government access.
It has been commented here that anyone who can get the source code can
comment those lines out.
Let's be frank, very few will have that option.
However, a software patch could be made that commented out the offending
code of any given product.  Perhaps also altering some visible part of the
program so that you know that your conversations are now secure.  Perhaps
the addition of a small ascii character to the corner of the screen.
The program that delivers the patch could be made in the form of a rather
innocuous computer virus.  Or, if you prefer, a worm.  This way, the program
can travel the same highways of silicon that the GAKked messages travel to
deGAK the software that it targets whenever it encounters it.
Give the software a relatively short lifespan, on the order of a year or so,
before all copies check thier date and decide to self destruct.  No need for
the virus if the software has been upgraded.  Then you'd need a new version
of the virus.
The project would be a large one as persons would have to get ahold of the
source.  Probably through decompiling it and figuring out what the now
undocumented source does at each step.  The actual virus would be easy to
code by comparison.
This should not preclude fighting the onset of GAK, rather the functional
incorporation of GAK.  What is the government going to do with 50,000
americans who have been using unGAKked software because they didn't know
that it had been infected?
Keep the visual clue as small as possible, maybe an extra period in a line
of periods.  That way an argument can be made for ignorance of the crime.
That is all.

I sent an e-mail to my representative, Mr. J. C. Watts Jr.  Regrettably, he
is on the national security board, so I don't hold out much hope of
converting him.
I presented him, however inelegantly my words, with the currently popular
housekey escrow with the IRS.  I also presented another of security cameras
in everyones homes for looking in occasionally.  Finally I asked that he
watch 1984 and warned him about not watching it in the company of minors.
Maybe he'll watch 1984, BECAUSE it has nudity, though.
