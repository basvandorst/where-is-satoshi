The following message is a courtesy copy of an article

No, just a cold staying in bed for a week.
So here is the anouncemant:
A new CDR Node has opened at koeln.ccc.de. The machine is Located
in NRW, Germany and keeps logs.
To quote   About Cypherpunks
  This is a european node of the cypherpunks distributed
  remailer (CDR). Other Nodes can be reached at
  majordomo at ssz.com, majordomo at cyberpass.net,
  majordomo at minder.net, majordomo at algebra.com and
  listproc at openpgp.net. There is also the classical
  cypherpunks at toad.com node which is in an undetermined state.
  The koeln.ccc.de node feeds minder.net and ssz.com. It recives
  feeds from minder.net, cyberpass.net, algebra.com
  ano openpgp.net.
  This specific node drops messages bigger than 32k and every
  message with more than 17 recipients or just a line
  containing "subscribe" or "unsubscribe" in the subject. This
  node is also available read-only by nntp.
  There is some Information how Jim Choate sees CDR history at
  szz.com. Older archives can be found at inet-one, at
  venona.com and lanesbry.com. If you interested in physical
  meetings visit meetingpunks.
  To see the collection of prior postings to the list, visit the
  Cypherpunks Archives.=20
I'm still not really happy with the software but it seems to work
without hickups. The nntp-part is still unstable but this
shouldn't affect the mail-part. One nice Feature is that you can
get a digest. Anonymous UUCP over TCP/ISDN/V.90 for cypherpunks
is planned but will take some time.
I still didn't get contact with algebra.com, openpgp.net and
cyberpass.net administrators to exchange backbone traffic.

In Germany there is a Group calling themselvs "Sportenthusiasts
of Lockpicking" -  They have a tournament
every year at the CCC Congress and be assured they open nearly
every Lock in James Bond Time.

@_subject: CDR: GEMA / tax Lars 
I just checked the Legal Status of the GEMA -
GEMA is a "eingetragener Verein" (registered Club) and has no
direct association with the state. But there is the
"Urheberrechtswahrnehmungsgesetz", sometimes called Lex GEMA.
It basically says that you have to proof to GEMA (it doesn't
spell out GEMA) that you haven't played music registered with
GEMA. If you don't they can sue you for royalities in court. They
don't have to proof anything.

@_subject: CDR: Type I Remailer Software. 
Can anybody suggest a Unix package for a Type I (Cypherpunk)
Remailer? To me it seems everybody just rolls its own. But a full
featured remailer with blacklisting, helptexts, headerrewriting,
key rotation, pool, delay, spam protection (?), stats and so on
has a significant complexty. I don't want to duplicate work done
already by others.
freedom seems to be the package which once got the most maintance
but there seem to be no active developed remailer software for
Unix today.
Any comments/hints?

@_subject: Talking to the Press Considered Harmful 
I share Tims experience regarding the impact of interviews. I was
doing some presswork for the chaos computer club -
 and found out that especially TV costs you a
hell of time and often thorow away everything substantial or even
the whole interview at all. TV wants to "visualize", but crypto
or hacking can't be visualized in a TV compatible way.
While TV is worest the same is true for 98% of the journalists I
have met: They don't try to understand the komplex things you are
talking about and if they finnally might understand you they
still misquote you. This shouldn't supprise you. This shouldn't
supprise me because journalists are information dealers trying to
get maximum value from minimum effort. Since "trouth" doesn't
really attribute to value of an information they sell, why should
they care about?
The problem is that they are used to people beeing proud to be
interviewed. If you consider an interview as buiseness they are
totally set up. "Sure I can explain tis DDOS thing to you, my
consulting fee is 1000E per day" makes them really angry.
On the other hand talking to journalists may help sometimes to
influence actions of the goverment. E.g. the Chaos Computer Club
got a lot of press coverage in the 80s which lead to involvment
of the hacker community in the law-making process for cybercrime
and to an 'hacking is not a crime per se' legistation which i
consider a good thing.
So between writing code and talking to journalists, what are the
other choices?

@_subject: Talking to the Press Considered Harmful 
Sure, thats why I and others at koeln.ccc.de started just telling
journalists to go away, it works fine for us and saves a lot of
time. Andy Mueller Maguhn can play the Media Bizz game with far
better success, but success for whom?
But I still would be very glad if you as a person probably
understanding the media biz can give a hint what is so
fundamentally wrong about the assumptions in above paragraph.
