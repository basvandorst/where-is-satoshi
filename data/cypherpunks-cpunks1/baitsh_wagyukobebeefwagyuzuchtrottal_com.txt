i have never been an animal person i swore id never have a dog who wants to pick up poop not me but somehow in my baby hungry weakness i was convinced to relent by the other two mccalebs who said they desperately needed a puppy fine whatever just take care of her and pick up the poop
like this one for instance my older brother uploaded it while reminiscing about the old buggie he rebuilt in the 80s i spent a few years calming down my teen angst and attempting to grow up i loved san luis obispo i was ready to chill there for good and how every plan ive ever made has been reconstructed into something harder and better than what i laid out as my own agenda i swear nothing makes me happier than a peaceful space and some needles all kits are shipped phew

my problem dear anne is that it is 2009 kids dont like to get all fussied up anymore and i dont think they would go to the trouble of making up stories about lost broaches to be able to go to a silly church picnic in my mind the little girls are wearing spring dresses and holding parasols with their gloved hands while the boys are eating biscuits and drinking homemade rootbeer with their hats and suspenders on but i live in a dreamland where i want everything stylized i know you understand me anne
