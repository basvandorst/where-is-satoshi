@_subject: Colorado Catacombs BBS: 303-772-1062 
Please note that the correct number for the Colorado Catacombs BBS is
303-772-1062.  I have been getting a lot of people calling my home voice phone number with a modem, and this is not fun, especially with those who do so at wierd times and without their speaker engaged.
Also, note that the old number for the Colorado Catacombs, 303-938-9654, has been disconnected due to lack of funds for the BBS.  Sorry about that, but in true cypherpunk style, I want to keep the BBS up and running with free service for fellow cypherpunks, so I rely on donations instead of subscriptions.
Colorado Catacombs BBS - 303-772-1062  (2 lines, same number)
8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity, up to 28,800 bps (one modem is 28,800, the other is 14,400), ANSI terminal emulation.  Access for all crypto files is free (in the USA and Canada), and you may use a psuedonym to log in if you like.  (I do ask for your real name, but that is for my own reference in evaluating uploads).
By the way, web lovers try  for pgp info.

WHERE TO GET THE PRETTY GOOD PRIVACY PROGRAM (PGP) FAQ
Revised 24 May 1996
Disclaimer -- I haven't recently verified all of the information in
this file, and much of it is probably out of date.
For questions not covered here, please read the documentation
that comes with PGP, get one of the books mentioned below, or search for
other relevant FAQ documents at rtfm.mit.edu and on the alt.security.pgp
news group.
A NOTE FROM THE FAQ MAINTAINERS
Peter Herngaard  is taking over the maintenance
of this FAQ until further notice.
Some of you sent me (Mike Johnson) corrections and suggestions for
this FAQ, and I stored them away on my hard disk to edit from. Then,
Windows 95 got indigestion (induced by a sound card) and destroyed
all of the data in that partition. If you suggested changes and they
aren't in this FAQ, please send them to Peter Herngaard

IS PGP LEGAL?
Pretty Good Privacy is legal if you follow these rules:
Don't export PGP from the USA except to Canada, or from Canada except to the
USA, without a license.
If you are in the USA, use either Viacrypt PGP (licensed for commercial use)
or MIT PGP using RSAREF (limited to personal, noncommercial use). Outside of
the USA, where RSA is not patented, you may prefer to use a version of PGP
(2.6.3i) that doesn't use RSAREF to avoid the restrictions of that license.
If you are in a country where the IDEA cipher patent holds in
software (including the USA, Canada, and some countries in Europe), make
sure you are licensed to use the IDEA cipher commercially before using
PGP commercially. (No separate license is required to use the freeware
PGP for personal, noncommercial use). For direct IDEA licensing, contact
Ascom Systec:
Erhard Widmer,  Ascom Systec AG, Dep't. CMVV      Phone  +41 64 56 59 83
Peter Hartmann, Ascom Systec AG, Dep't. CMN       Phone  +41 64 56 59 45
Fax:            +41 64 56 59 90
e-mail:         IDEA at ascom.ch
Mail address:   Gewerbepark, CH-5506 Maegenwil (Switzerland)
Viacrypt has an exclusive marketing agreement for commercial
distribution of Philip Zimmermann's copyrighted code. (Selling
shareware/freeware disks or connect time is OK). This restriction does
not apply to PGP 3.0, since it is a complete rewrite by Colin Plumb.
If you modify PGP (other than porting it to another platform, fixing a bug,
or adapting it to another compiler), don't call it PGP (TM) or Pretty Good
Privacy (TM) without Philip Zimmermann's permission.
Please note that there is an official distribution site for MIT
PGP and another for the International version:
WorldWideWeb references:
U.S/Canada non-commercial use: Norway/International non-commercial use: U.S. commercial use: WHAT IS PHILIP ZIMMERMANN'S LEGAL STATUS?
Philip Zimmermann was under investigation for alleged violation of export
regulations, with a grand jury hearing evidence for about 28 months, ending
11 January 1996. The Federal Government chose not to comment on why it
decided to not prosecute, nor is it likely to.  The Commerce Secretary stated
that he would seek relaxed export controls for cryptographic products, since
studies show that U. S. industry is being harmed by current regulations.
Philip endured some serious threats to his livelihood and freedom, as well as
some very real legal expenses, for the sake of your right to electronic
privacy.  The battle is won, but the war is not over. The regulations that
caused him so much grief and which continue to dampen cryptographic
development, harm U. S. industry, and do violence to the U. S. National
Security by eroding the First Ammendment of the U. S. Constitution and
encouraging migration of cryptographic industry outside of the U. S. A. are
still on the books.  If you are a U. S. Citizen, please write to your U. S.
Senators, Congressional Representative, President, and Vice President
pleading for a more sane and fair cryptographic policy.
WHERE CAN I GET WINDOWS & DOS SHELLS FOR PGP?
 Idaho)
WHAT OTHER FILE ENCRYPTION (DOS, MAC) TOOLS ARE THERE?
PGP can do conventional encryption only of a file (-c) option, but
you might want to investigate some of the other alternatives if you do
this a lot. Alternatives include Quicrypt and Atbash2 for DOS, DLOCK for
DOS & UNIX, Curve Encrypt (for the Mac), HPACK (many platforms), and a
few others.
Quicrypt is interesting in that it comes in two flavors:  shareware
exportable and registered secure. Atbash2 is interesting in that it generates
ciphertext that can be read over the telephone or sent by Morse code. DLOCK
is a no-frills strong encryption program with complete source code. Curve
Encrypt has certain user-friendliness advantages. HPACK is an archiver (like
ZIP or ARC), but with strong encryption. A couple of starting points for your
search are:
U.S. only availability:
International availability:
HOW DO I SECURELY DELETE FILES (DOS)?
If you have the Norton Utilities, Norton WipeInfo is pretty good. I
use DELETE.EXE in del110.zip, which is really good at deleting existing
files, but doesn't wipe "unused" space.
WHAT DO I DO ABOUT THE PASS PHRASE IN MY WINDOWS SWAP FILE?
The nature of Windows is that it can swap any memory to disk at any
time, meaning that all kinds of interesting things could end up in your
swap file.
WHERE DO I GET PGPfone(tm)?
PGPfone is in beta test for Macintosh and Windows'9 users.
The MIT has shut down their ftp distribution of PGPfone  for
Macintosh and Windows'95, so within the U.S/Canada you must obtain
PGPfone  using a WorldWideWeb browser.
U.S. only availability:
International availability:
WHERE DO I GET NAUTILUS?
Bill Dorsey, Pat Mullarky, and Paul Rubin have come out with a
program called Nautilus that enables you to engage in secure voice
conversations between people with multimedia PCs and modems capable of
at least 7200 bps (but 14.4 kbps is better). See:
U.S. only availability:

HOW DO I ENCRYPT MY DISK ON-THE-FLY?
Secure File System (SFS) is a DOS device driver that encrypts an entire
partition on the fly using SHA in feedback mode.
Secure Drive also encrypts an entire DOS partition, using IDEA, which is
Secure Device is a DOS device driver that encrypts a virtual, file-hosted
volume with IDEA.
Cryptographic File System (CFS) is a Unix device driver that uses DES.
CryptDisk is a ShareWare package for Macintosh that uses strong IDEA
encryption like PGP.
U.S. only availability:
International availability:
WHERE IS PGP'S COMPETITION?
RIPEM is the second most popular freeware email encryption package.  I like
PGP better for lots of reasons, but if for some reason you want to check or
generate a PEM signature, RIPEM is available at ripem.msu.edu. There is also
an exportable RIPEM/SIG.
U.S. only availability:
International availability:
HOW DO I PUBLISH MY PGP PUBLIC KEY?
Send mail to one of these addresses with the single word "help" in the
subject line to find out how to use them. These servers sychronize keys with
each other.  There are other key servers, too.
pgp-public-keys at keys.pgp.net
pgp-public-keys at keys.de.pgp.net
pgp-public-keys at keys.no.pgp.net
pgp-public-keys at keys.uk.pgp.net
pgp-public-keys at keys.us.pgp.net
WWW interface to the key servers: For US $20/year or so, you can have your key officially certified and
published in a "clean" key database that is much less susceptible to
denial-of-service attacks than the other key servers. Send mail to
info-pgp at Four11.com for information, or look at Of course, you can always send your key directly to the parties you wish to
correspond with by whatever means you wish.

@_subject: Crypto site move http://www.sni.net/~mpj/usa/warning.htm 
The method for accessing my strong crypto library ftp site has
changed to one that I hope is easier for those of you who are in
the USA or Canada.  Simply point your browser to
 and follow the
instructions. This should work even with text-based browsers,
like lynx, and should be easier to navigate for AOL customers.
You may be amused that the President of the United States has
determined that cryptographic software export controls are
necessary for U. S. "National Security" even though the same
software is available "or appears to be available" from outside
of the USA. For a partial list of cryptographic software sites
outside of North America, see

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
There is another change to the way I distribute strong
cryptographic software at my ftp site (ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/).
The strong cryptographic software is still in a hidden directory
with a name that changes periodically, but access is via a
password protected web form at  that
has the current hidden directory name expanded in it. To get
your very own user name and password, please fill out the form
at  and then watch your
email box.
This change is to comply with the new Export Administration
Regulation (EAR) changes that require "checking the destination
machine's address" to ensure that it is in the USA or Canada to
avoid being accused of exporting without a license.  My many
friends outside of North America need not feel left out,
however, as I have a nice listing of some good crypto sites that
they can legally access at which probably points to places with most, if not all, of the
cryptographic programs that are archived at my site.
Although the hoops are not so hard to navigate at crypto sites
outside of North America, I hope that a well-connected site in
Colorado will provide faster downloads for people in the USA and
Canada. This ftp site is rather busy, so if your connection is
refused, please try back at a time that is less busy.
If you have some high quality, strong cryptographic software or
libraries that you would like me to host, please let me know at
mpj at csn.net. Space is limited, but I have room for a few more
things, like programs to take on the RSA challenge contests,
