Below you will find the answers to the questions posed in your letter
dated 12th October.
1.	Is the implementation of European GSM encryption algorithm A5/1
reduced in strength to 54 bits?
10 of the bits are set to 0. Therefore the effective key length is 54 bits.
2.	Is the implementation of the A5/1 encryption algorithm used in
one or more GSM systems in Denmark reduced in strength to 54 bits?
all GSM operators in Denmark currently use the standard algorithm which has
the 54 bit effective key length.
3.	Why is the A5/1 algorithm reduced in strength?
in many countries regarding the use of encryption. As algorithms are treated
as dual use goods, similar to munitions, their movement and use is
regulated and certain countries place a limit on their strength. As GSM was
designed and developed to be used throughout Europe the design of the
algorithm had to take the restrictions of various countries into account.
4.	Who ordered the reduction of the A5 algorithm?
group would have decided on the key length.
