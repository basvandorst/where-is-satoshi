i am going to turn on some good music and choose to be happy.
i was given the irish name kelly after my great grandparents' last name. in a tiny town in idaho
i am determined to get the house clean so i can relax and sew tomorrow.
really really happy.
my happy plans for this evening include knitting and watching two favorite movies: far and away followed by tristan and isolde.
i told cate about st. patrick's day and ireland- she has a lot of irish ancestors through me. 3. i think that packages stacked all over the house are a nice decorative touch (and they remind me how good people are to donate to project 31) happy things! 1. in the craft room i throw everything on the homework table. that clears up the floor for more mess craft making. haha, that's my girl. soft and long lacy scarf light enough for spring, extra long for winter wrapping, elegant enough for church, cute enough for a tshirt...i really love this scarf pattern (gee can you tell?). and it's so yummy
we are happily enjoying being able to play outside again. What are your tips for clearing clutter so you can focus on such a project as sewing?" well mary, let me answer your question by showing you some examples of how i deal with clutter in different areas of my home:
may the light always find you on a dreary day.
and totally not what you are supposed to be eating
wooohoooo!" i love the color palette and obvious softness. she's cute
last minute trip to idaho to see my sister- so much better than home blogging!
