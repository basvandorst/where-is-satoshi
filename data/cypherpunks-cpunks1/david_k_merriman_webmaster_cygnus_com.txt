@_subject: Cookies on Microsoft Explorer? 
My MSIE3.0b2 does cookies - tho' I've told it to ask me if it's OK first I've even got a specific _sub-directory_ for cookies under my Windows dir. I just wish I could automate the refuse-it-if-it-doesn't-expire "policy" I'm running under.

@_subject: Cookies on Microsoft Explorer? 
I have IE3 configured to ask me for permission to accept a cookie. Yes, some sites send (n!)+1 cookies during a session. If they send too many, I personally move on to another site, after sending them email (!).
Sorry for the confusion - the refuse-it policy I mentioned is a personal policy; there's no option (yet) to configure something like that in IE3. The only two things I've personally seen have been cookies with specific expiration dates (which I usually accept, if the date is reasonable [IMHO]), and cookies that don't display an expiration (which I refuse out-of-hand). It seems to be a compromise that suits _me_; YMMV.
I can 'automate' to the extent of automatically accepting all cookies; yes, by not accepting every cookie, I'm obliged to make a decision for each request. One of the 'benefits' of being somewhate security-aware :-)
