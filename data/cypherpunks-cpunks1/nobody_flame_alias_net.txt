@_subject: Out of state gambling 
Hello C-Punks:
(nb This is posted anonymously because I had this idea the implementation
of which would be (probably) illegal.  I'm not sure whether putting my name to the idea would be a good idea for the reason that I can't be
sure that I wouldn't be implicated under the overbroad "conspiracy" or
"Rico" powers which are oh so popular as a way of putting people away
for thought crimes.  This message will in any case have appeared via
a couple of foreign remailers on it's way. I am proud of the idea, but
I appreciate those of you who know who I am keeping quiet about it, as
I'm just being prudent, and extra cautious.
The idea.....Out of state gambling, Internet style - lets give them a
taste of whats to come.
You may recall that a short time before Pres. Clinton got elected, the
Wall Street Journal had an article about gambling taking place in Moscow
and London on the outcome of the election.  The story told by the article
was that the bookmakers in London had more up to date and better info.
than Gallup and Roper obtained with all their phone polls.  The London bookie's accuracy was vindicated by the outcome, as Clinton
won, and by the predicted margin.
Ahhh...The power of the free market. Makes sense too, if it's your own
money on the line rather than someone else's phone call (during a meal,
of course) I wander how many US bets were placed in England (covertly,
via friends etc.).  The internet casino, which will soon be open for
business -  - adds a new Internet related twist
to this.  Could someone, perhaps a furriner, perhaps talk to the folks
at casino.org and see if they would be willing to open a book on
presidential election outcomes.  Or perhaps organize something with
an enterprising London/Moscow gambling house, preferably with fast
IP feed, and constantly updated odds on the web.
The Internet Casino is advertising that they will be having their "Grand Opening" on August 18.
My aim is to make cheap, timely & accurate poll predictions, not
to encourage contravention of the gambling laws, which are, after all,
oh so important to protecting life as we know it. If some people choose to avoid these laws I disclaim all resposibility, but the anon.
remailer is insurance that all of you will feel the same way.
The aim in writing this short missive to cpunks is to encourage
someone who is more able legally to help this idea happen.
Just attempting to add some substance to Tim's sig. quote, about
national borders being merely "speed bumps", my ideal implementation
would see lots of e$ bets, cpunk-remailers, and (for US citizens) strong
Any suggestions for books?
I've got a few (besides the obvious, "Who Wins"?) such as:
Which Republican will win the nomination?
Will "Speaker Newt" run.
Will "Moneybag$" enter the race?
If so, will he drop out and enter again?
Any comments on the practical and legal issues (such as exactly what
laws I'm violating) or on getting publicity for such a scheme? This
might be easier than we think, as the media [at least the WSJ] is well
aware of the bookie's superior accuracy & lower cost.
Thank you.

@_subject: UK Guardian article on 2nd SSL breaking 
from the "uk-pipeline":
  CYPHERPUNKS LEAD NETSCAPE'S NAVIGATOR ASTRAY
  A team of computer experts has succeeded in breaking the secure 'key'   used on international versions of the World-Wide Web browser, Netscape   Navigator.
  The key would normally have been used to secure transmission of sensitive   information, such as credit card details, between a Web-surfer and a Web   site, such as an on-line shopping service.
  However, the cypherpunks, as they are known, only cracked the 40-bit key   that is used by export versions of Netscape Navigator, since US   Government regulations prevent the export of software that uses stronger   cryptographic techniques. "We have, quite categorically, demonstrated   that 40-bit keys are too weak to use for commercial systems," said Dr.   Piete Brookes, a computer officer at Cambridge University who managed the   project.  The code cracking took 31 hours and 47 minutes of computer time   on around 300 machines strung across the internet.
  The team was able to crack the code because they had been provided with   the transcript of a secure transmission.  Such transcripts are not   impossible to acquire, according to Dr. Brookes: "All you need is a tap   on the line, or access to a computer in a suitable part of the network.".   The 128-bit key used by American versions of Netscape Navigator is "well   out of reach of any hacker groups in the forseeable future."  He   estimates it would take one billion, billion, billion, billion years to   break.

@_subject: The Recent Flurry of Anit-Crypto Activity... Why? 
from 'Buzz White': Good theory, but I think the major reason is more obvious. We have elected "representatives", led by a complete slimeball president, that
want to usurp every bit of liberty we have. Money, soul, healthcare,
private property, you name it. The sooner they can grab it, the more
completely they can control us. Crypto, digicash, and remailers work
against their attempts, so they try to stop them. The more they want
something from us, the stronger our effort must be not to let them have
it. They think we need their "help" to live our lives, and that without we would be helpless. They think we're all like those pathetic people in LA who had no clue what to do with their welfare checks when check cashing
stores were torched during the Rod-knee King Bar-B-Q and Block Party. The
sad part is that as more and more people are absorbed into the welfare
state, fewer remain to assert our right to personal liberty and our
right "to be left alone". We're likely to lose by attrition.

@_subject: e-cash gambling 
[I am posting anonymously, but about a half-dozen of you will know who
I am. Please keep it confidential. I have posted (anonymously) a while
back on this subject, and I am aware of the lame, hard to use college
site which does something similar to what I will again suggest.]
I would like to see e-cash gambling on US Presidential elections/primaries
[as is currently done in London & Moscow]. There was an interesting W$J
article that pointed out how the odds in these gambling houses track the
results of elections more accurately (from thousands of miles away) than
Gallup & Roper ever have, (and without calling me at suppertime). The
W$J article appeared right after Clinton's victory over Bush. A web-page
in London giving the odds in easy-to-read form would be nice, and might
quickly lead to demand for actual gambling from "this side of the pond."
This could be accomplished through anonymous remailers & strong crypto.
It would accomplish the cypherpunk goals of setting important information
free through use of our technology, it would encourage gamblers to learn
about strong crypto, and it would use crypto for something besides child
porn or drugs, which will be good PR for us. There will, of course, be
lame arguments about this "demeaning the integrity of the process," but
I think Letterman and Leno could be trusted to handle them without our
help. ;)

@_subject: NSA gets into the ISP business 
Recently I went out shopping for a cheaper ISP.  I found one which was very
inexpensive.  Too inexpensive.  At first I was thrilled...then I began to
wonder how they could charge so little.  Pcix.com is offering static ip
address, domain name, etc, the whole schebang for $20 a month, or $75 if
you want a dedicated line.  That's less then TLG, and TLG is a non-profit
As the saying goes, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
It seems our government friends have found themselves a new hobby.  I'm
not sure exactly what this sting operation was set up for, but I'm sure
you can use your imagination.
The user agreement is very interesting.  It states: 1) You're not allowed
to upload any encryption software (even if you don't export it) or have
any strong crypto in your shell account, and 2) They are allowed to
monitor anything you send over their network.  Spooks' dream ISP.
Highlights from the user agreement:
Section 2.7(b)
Section 4.1

@_subject: HipCrime and Spam 
I think you were referring to yourself, Robert.  :)
Since you don't seem to understand the concept of spam very well yet,
try this little experiment:
Go downtown to City Hall and post advertisements for your website on
all the walls and doors.  Be sure to put one on the Mayor's office and
all the members of the City Council.  If they complain, explain to them
why they are weak-minded souls who can't remove unwanted messages.
Go to the local art gallery and post your signs all over.  Tell people
that since your web site is an "art project", that you are posting EXACTLY
on topic, to an "appropriate group".  Ask, "So, what's your problem ?!?"
Pass out survey forms.  Ask people where they want to see advertisements.
Go to these sites and spray-paint your http address.  If people complain
that you are "harassing" them, ask them why a whopping eighteen letters
written on the wall is harassment.  Tell them it's not *your* fault,
that you're just doing what other people told you to.  Explain how many
trees you are saving by using spray-paint instead of paper.
When the police handcuff you and take you away, complain that they are
censoring you.  Tell the judge that you want to sue the cops for violating
your civil rights.  While you're in jail, think about why what you did
was wrong.
