2008 International Workshop on Multimedia Security in Communication  In Conjunction with ChinaCom'08
Beijing, China, August 25 - 27, 2008
The rapid development of communication techniques allows us to  transmit more than text/binary data in real time. Due to unique  characteristics of multimedia content, such as large data volumes,  interactive operations, and requires real-time responses, the problems  multimedia security need to address are different from text/binary  data security. Furthermore, multimedia security is highly services- dependable. Different services require different methods for content  transmission or distribution, paying, interaction, etc.
This workshop aims to bring together research work covering various  aspects of multimedia security in emerging services. The services may  work in the following environment: Internet, mobile TV, IPTV, IMS,  VoIP, P2P, sensor network, network convergence, etc. The paper may  focus on architecture construction, algorithm designing or hardware  implementation. Both review paper and technical paper are expected.
This workshop solicits papers reporting recent unpublished works in  the general area of multimedia security. The topics include but not  limited to:
Security threats to multimedia content in new services
Security model for new services
Lightweight multimedia encryption for services
Information hiding in multimedia content
Multimedia forensics
Secure multimedia adaptation
Multimedia copy tracking
Multimedia content authentication
Multimedia content filtering
Secure payment for services
Key management/distribution
User authentication in services
Biometric Security
Intrusion detection/prevention
Network filtering
Secure set-top box
Secure Smart Cards
Secure SIM card
Secure telecom/broadcast convergence
Secure mobile/Internet convergence
Interoperable DRM systems
Conditional access systems
Security protocols or standards
Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks in multimedia application
The submission should be done according to the guidelines on  . The revised or extended versions of the accepted and presented  papers will be published in the special issue of International Journal  of Security and Communication Network (SCN)    or International Journal of Universal Computer Science (JUCS)  (pending) Important Dates
