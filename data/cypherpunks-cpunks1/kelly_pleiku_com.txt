@_subject: secdev1.2, hp100lx and HP PCMIA card support and security(nonexistant) 
Well the elimination of a very weak security feature on the HP palmtop line
the hp 95lx password option, just a screenlock, in the hp100lx any pretence to privacy is now gone.    As a result I initially attempted to load the binaries for the secdev1.2 release and was chagrinned to find out they get divide errors on the lowly
8088 clone of the hp100lx...? any ideas?(I suspect they are compiled for 80386
and up and will disassemble to verify after intial recompilation to 8088 targets.. Has any done this already??
     cheers

@_subject: Harassment of a mailing list by lassie!jim%lassie@netcom.com 
And you sir have a netcom feed... as do I... I will be talking with Bob Rieger
about your harassment of other netcom users on this list...
I feel that you WILL lose your accounts with netcom if this HARASSMENT doesnt stop. I suggest you think about your highly immature actions of the last week..
a copy of this mail is being forwarded to noc at netcom.com as well as bobr at netcom.com... in fact I am sending a copy of ALL of your postings to
netcom management... mailbombing a mailing list IS NOT with in
netcom's AUP(that is Acceptable Use Policy). and IS grounds for revocation of
your accounts on netcom...
     Think about it...
