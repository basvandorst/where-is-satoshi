   -------------------------------------------------
 CNN's IAN GODDARD TWA 800 "PLOT"
(c) 1997 Ian Williams Goddard
I've tried to decisively extricate myself from my TWA 800 inquiry, but it
seems that CNN and the gov't don't want me to go. CNN is spreading gross
misinformation on television, indicating that I said my inquiry into TWA
800  was part of a "sham" and a "plot."  That is FALSE!! I've always
promoted what I believe, and now I believe promoting the Navy-missile
theory was a big mistake! I believe that the evidence is not sufficient to
blame the Navy and I wish to move away from that and all areas of
conspiracy inquiry forever. But I never said my inquiries were a "plot" or
a "sham."
Christine Negroni with CNN contacted me a few days ago to ask about my
change of direction,  I did not contact her. CNN reports now suggest that I
said my conspiracy inquiry was part of a "plot" (a secret scheme) to do
damage to the government's reputation. That's 100% FALSE !!
My only crime is honesty. I'm honest enough to admit, as I have for months,
that my inquiry into TWA 800 was an effort to identify untruth in the
government. I have a fact-based bias against government, I'm a libertarian.
My webpage was entitled "Anti-Authoritarian Journal," identifying my bias
up front, unlike most sources.
Such up-front honesty is NOT a "plot," as CNN attempts to portray it. The
fact is that anything that is labeled what it is up front is by definition
NOT a plot. I'd say CNN has a bias for the gov't line, however, does CNN
label its journalism "Authoritarian Journalism?" No.
WITNESSES NOT MY FAULT
I did not invent nor am I to blame for the fact that 150+ witnesses
reported having seen something fly upwards and explode at the spot TWA 800
was. That there were such wit- nesses, up to 154, has been widely reported
in the media.
CNN just reported in reference to me:
Joe Lychner of Houston, who lost his wife and two daughters in the crash,
told CNN that Goddard and Salinger owe an explana- tion to the American
The basis of the missile theory are the witnesses, and I did not invent the
witnesses. If anyone owes America an explanation for the missile theory I
think it's the wit- nesses, not me. All I did was report what they said and
commit the error of theorizing that maybe that fiery thing shooting up was
a Navy missile and the Navy is covering it up. I also did not invent the
Navy-missile theory. My explanation for that theory is that the Navy is
known to have many missiles and is known to be off- shore where the plane
crashed. However, an inventory showed that all Navy missiles were accounted
OK fine, I'm ready to move on, but it seems they aren't:
National Transportation and Safety Board spokesman Peter Goelz told CNN
that my re-reporting of witness accounts and theorizing that the Navy was
at fault has done "real damage" and "caused innumerable people great
agony." Wow! It seems I'm a human monster of immense proportions.
I am sorry for that, yet it would seem that the fault lies in part and
primarily with the major media for ever having reported the witness
accounts in the first place. I then made the mistake of suggesting that the
Navy may have been at fault and is covering it up, which I now see as a
mistake, for I could be wrong and if I'm wrong I've impugned the
reputations of America's finest, which is something I should not and do not
now want to do, and for which having done in the past, I am very sorry.
I don't know what happened to TWA 800, and at this point I don't care! I
just want to be left alone and no longer harassed by the major media and
others over the TWA 800 case. I'm sorry I thought the Navy did it. It was a
mistaken thought. I'm sorry my thoughts have "caused innumerable people
great agony." I'm a humani- tarian and have been a vegetarian for 19 years
because I want NOT to cause suffering to any living being.
CNN's "SECRET SCHEME" THEORY
I've never published anything I thought was false. I even published errata
notices when required. All claims I've made were meticulously referenced so
that readers could check up on what I said for themselves. Providing not
just referenced information and ideas but all the links necessary to access
the larger body of information about the case is what made my reports so
popular and what made this little guy the focus of world news.
My plan has been to end my "war on the Establishment." Wanting to move on
from conspiracy theory and set a new course, I asked Doctor David Stern,
who hosts the DEEP TIMES webpage, to remove my conspiracy reports. However,
due to CNN's misleading charges that I've admitted to having been engaged
in a "plot" and thus that I will- fully attempted to mislead people to
believe what I knew to be false, I have requested that David Stern
temporarily replace all my reports so that people can judge for themselves
if I was the liar CNN suggests.
It will take David some time to get the reports back up, but when they are
up you can access them directly at:  or
indirectly at:  Please check the first site
within the next few days.

A newly released, final version of the report on the Carnivore

US House Majority Leader Dick Armey made the following comments about the newly released, final report on the Carnivore cybersnooping system: This superficial review doesn't get to the heart of the matter. It does nothing to restore the confidence that Americans should have in the confidentiality of their online transactions.
Why should average Internet users have to wonder whether a rogue agent could snoop through their emails and other online transactions?
If this Administration were actually interested in an honest evaluation of Carnivore, it would have shut the system down until the serious privacy concerns had been adequately addressed. Instead, this review by a team with clear ties to this Administration raises more concerns than it answers.

      JORDAN (Star) - IT'S OFFICIAL: The Internet is the latest
    battleground. If you've been reading the news recently, you will
    probably have noticed reports on website hack-attacks between Arab and
    Israeli users.
    It started last week, with an Israeli attack on the Hezbollah website
    ( by which hackers crashed the site's server by
    flooding it with requests. It was an organized effort, carried out by
    several hackers.
    A news report stated that the attack on Hezbollah's site was first
    initiated by a message that was circulated over the ICQ instant
    messaging service. The message urged users to help their "Israeli
    friends" take the Hezbollah site down by using a ping command on their
    PCs. Throughout the day, Israeli users plotted their attack, and
    implemented it.
    Later in the week, a number of Israeli government sites were attacked,
    including the site of the Foreign Ministry and the Prime Minister's
    website. It became quite apparent that this would be the beginning of
    a wave of attacks and counter attacks, pitting the hacking skills of
    Arabs against the skills of Israelis.
    Reports began to emerge that all sorts of Arabic and Israeli websites
    were crashing under attack. Political, academic and even entertainment
    sites were coming under attack.
    The Amman-based news portal, albawaba.com, got hit by a flood of
    pro-Israeli messages on one of its discussion forums, which resulted
    in the political forum being closed down until the technicians
    diverted the messages and reopened it. On the other hand a newspaper
    reported, in detail, how an Arab hacker, who calls himself Dodi,
    succeeded in "defacing the Netanya Academy site in Israel, leaving a
    message that attacked Israel and the US and criticized Arab
    governments. The activist said he would carry on with his attacks
    until the whole Internet backbone in Israel was down." Obviously,
    there are enough Arab Internet users out there to counter attack. In
    fact, if numbers count in this new web- war, Israeli sites will
    probably be worried at the potential Arab Internet population! So, the
    skirmishes continue and are set to go on, with more dangerous
    prospects emerging as the networks of governments, and large private
    corporations may become more vulnerable.
    Hackers seeking to cause maximum damage will target public records,
    which should be easily accessible over the web soon, due to the
    adoption of the concept of e-government. That's quite frightening.
    Opening up some of the government's computer networks to 'outsider'
    access could compromise the security of government records and result
    in all sorts of damage.
    Citizens like you and me will be pleased to enjoy the convenience of
    applying for a license online, but 'nasty' hackers will jump to the
    opportunity of delving into this e-government server, and finding out
    how far they can get into the government's other networks through it!
    So, apart from Internet warfare, there is the somewhat more worrying
    aspect of security breaches in government Intranets.
    The issue here is whether there is enough security to prevent the
    possibility of any harm being done by an intelligent, motivated
    hacker. If the hacker is the 'enemy', then who knows what kind of
    remorseless data theft and data destruction will be carried out.
    Apart from the damage done, the downtime will frustrate the network
    users, just like 39,000 Microsoft employees were locked out of the
    company network this week due to a hack attack! Contrary to the
    'patriotic' nature of recent hacking incidents in the Middle East,
    hacking cases tend to be corporate crime incidents. That kind of
    hacking will soon be happening in our region too.
    However, for now, the hackers are using their skills for patriotic
    purposes; seeking vengeance for crimes committed against the
    Palestinian people. Some people are calling them the 'secret
    warriors'.
    I like to think of them as the digital warriors of Arabia, in a
    battleground that transcends the traditional limitations of state
    borders. What we are witnessing now is just the beginning. One thing
    is for sure, there's more to come!

Online Voting, Even if Secure, Won't Solve Election Troubles
By Gary Chapman
Copyright 2000, The Los Angeles Times. All Rights Reserved
The uproar over last week's election results, particularly the controversy over the vote in Florida, has fueled calls for online voting. Some experts think the problems of last week could be solved by computerized voting, while others insist that is fraught with Controversy about how computers handle votes has been around for a while. It was an issue championed for years by longtime Los Angeles civil-liberties activist Mae Churchill, who died in 1996 at age 84. Churchill was the founder of Pacific Palisades-based Election Watch, and 15 years ago she convinced many technical experts that there are serious problems when computers are introduced into the voting "Mae Churchill got me into this issue," said Peter Neumann, a researcher at SRI International in Menlo Park, Calif., and an internationally known authority on computer security. Now, he said, "I would not trust a computerized voting system even if I had written itmyself, because of the many ways in which such systems can be "It's so easy to rig an election," Neumann said. He cited the fact that "punch card" ballots -- the cardboard ballots that use a punched hole to read a vote -- can be invalidated simply by running a needle through a stack of the cards. That can make it look like a vote for two candidates for the same office. Florida election officials threw out more than 19,000 ballots last week because of the appearance of voters selecting two candidates in the presidential election.
In Boston in 1993, Neumann said, a local election's results were reversed after authorities discovered errors caused by "hanging chad," the tiny paper remnant of a punched hole that can hang off the back side of the card ballot and then reclose the hole when the ballot is run through a light scanner for tabulation. This problem reportedly caused some of the vote tallies to change in last week's recounts in Florida.
Also in 1993 in Florida, a St. Petersburg precinct that had no registered voters because it was an industrial area showed 1,429 votes for an incumbent mayor, who won by 1,425 votes.
Another Florida case happened in 1988, when there were 200,000 fewer votes in the Senate race than for the presidential candidates, and most of the missing votes came from four counties that used the same computer vote-tallying vendor.
"If it was built by man, it can be broken by man," said Doug Lewis, director of the Election Center in Houston, an organization that does training and consulting for election officials nationwide. "People asking for [online voting] don't understand the electoral process and the incredible safety and security problems that go into that."
"I do worry that computer elections systems are large and complex systems," said David Jefferson, the technical director of the California Internet Voting Task Force and a researcher at Compaq Systems Research Center in Palo Alto. "The main worry is not bugs in the software or in communications, but each time they are used they have to be configured rather elaborately. Ballot choices have to fit a voter's residence, which can often be a complicated task. If they are misconfigured they can produce erroneous results."
The California secretary of state's task force on Internet voting recommended against remote online voting earlier this year.
"We have to understand that the security problems for allowing that are so severe that we can't recommend that solution at all. These problems are inherent in the architecture of the personal computer," Jefferson said.
Instead, some online voting proponents are supporting an interim solution: polling-place computer voting. "That kind of Internet voting can be fielded now, and the security problems are manageable," Jefferson noted.
Polling-place electronic voting involves using a networked computer to vote at a conventional polling site. This method has the added security of controlling the machines and identifying each voter in Some argued last week that polling-place electronic voting would have solved some of the problems Florida encountered. "Spoiling a ballot would be prevented by computer," Jefferson said. The computer program could prevent a confused or deliberate vote for two candidates in the same race. Another benefit might be that counties could report real-time vote counts, which could help prevent television networks or Web sites from inaccurately guessing at how a state's electoral college vote might turn out. Vote totals also could be reported instantly after the polls closed.
But Jefferson said the alleged confusion last week in Palm Beach County, Fla., where some people claim to have voted for Pat Buchanan when they meant to vote for Al Gore, still could be a problem in electronic voting, Jefferson said.
"Someone with a good design sense has to be in charge of the design of a screen, just like a paper ballot," he said. Even so, the obstacles to adopting polling-place electronic voting are daunting. Aside from the expense of providing every polling place with multiple computer systems, there are still significant security issues and a dearth of trained personnel in our election system.
"Most of us who have been in elections a long time are uncomfortable with the idea of turning over elections to a private, for-profit company," said Lewis of the Election Center. Although private companies do run election systems, they are supervised by public officials, usually at the county level. Few counties in the U.S. can afford to pay for technical experts who can evaluate and monitor sophisticated networked computer systems with multiple redundancies, encryption, complex backup and security measures, and state-of-the-art equipment.
Moreover, Lewis said, fraud in U.S. elections is low because the systems we use are so decentralized and cumbersome. Centralized and computerized data would be a tempting target for hackers, subversives and perhaps foreign governments, he said.
"Even companies with tens of millions of dollars for protecting their systems are penetrated," Lewis said. "How many counties have that kind of money?"
"Electronic voting is not going to solve our problems," Neumann said.
Lewis added: "Everyone wants instant Internet gratification. We've been conditioned to expect this now. The truth is we're not going to have instantaneous Internet voting. We're not going to be doing this in 'Internet time.' "

@_subject: CDR: First, Mexico's future lies with free, "open source" software 
[Sent with permission-MG]
DIGITAL NATION
Mexico Has Resources for High-Tech Success
By Gary Chapman
Copyright 2000, The Los Angeles Times, All Rights Reserved
An open letter to Mexican President-elect Vicente Fox:
Congratulations on your historic victory in the presidential election. About 100 million Mexicans and others who love Mexico are eager for change in your country, and they have high hopes when your new administration takes office in December.
But clearly, one issue of great importance is how to bring Mexico into the "new economy" of the Internet, high tech and global commerce. Mexico has many resources in technology to exploit, but they have been obstructed by weak or bad government policies. You can change this.
Let me offer you some suggestions on how you might start.
First, Mexico's future lies with free, "open source" software like the operating system Linux, and Gnome, another open-source effort to build a Windows-like screen. Gnome itself was developed by a young Mexican programmer, Miguel de Icaza, who is 27 years old. This summer, De Icaza started the Gnome Foundation ( to unify and stabilize the Linux desktop software, and he acquired the support of IBM, Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard and Compaq, among other major U.S. companies. He is a hero to young programmers around the world, and he should be a hero to all Mexicans. You should meet with Miguel de Icaza and get to know him and young people like him. They are the best hope for Mexico.
Obviously, the biggest benefit of free software to Mexico is that it's literally free, and Mexico is a poor country that needs to preserve its capital. Mexico has a new law on software piracy, for example, and your government will need to enforce this law for Mexico to be regarded as a trusted partner in high-tech trade. But if you do enforce the software piracy law effectively, it will result in a massive transfer of pesos to the United States, and principally to Microsoft, the largest victim of software piracy in Mexico.
Alternatively, you could promote the use of free software such as Linux, Gnome and application packages such as Sun Microsystems' StarOffice suite, which are all free. No pesos would leave Mexico and you would get all of the functionality of modern software. Indeed, you'd become part of a trend that is sweeping the computing field in the U.S. IBM, Dell, Hewlett-Packard and Compaq are all offering Linux on computers now. IBM is essentially a Linux company these days, an astonishing transformation. Mexico would not lose anything by adopting free software, indeed, it would move to the cutting edge of Your government should also think about creating an elite but grassroots-oriented corps of young free-software evangelists, programmers, hackers and systems developers who could build on the culture and spirit of the embryonic free-software movement. Give them an identity with special shirts or jackets and specially painted pickup trucks to go out to villages and towns, and elevate them to hero status in Mexico. They should have an esprit de corps that reflects both their enthusiasm for their work and their patriotism. Send them around the world to technical and trade conferences and make them stand out -- make them the young, technically skilled enthusiasts everyone wants to work with.
Joakim Ziegler is one of these wizard-like programmers. He's Norwegian, but he lives in Mexico City because he loves it there. He works for Helix Code, the company started by Miguel de Icaza. Ziegler is also in his twenties. He told me, "A change as radical as the internal use of free software" -- meaning use by the government itself -- "would be an indication of real change." The Federal Election Commission in Mexico used free software to run this year's election, but other government agencies have yet to grasp its Ziegler also said, "Small companies run by enthusiastic young people don't have a lot of status in Mexico right now." Too many of Mexico's young entrepreneurs have moved to the U.S. to start companies. In Mexico, there's too much government red tape, credit is too expensive and there is a culture of "not what you do, but who you know," all of which are obstacles to building the kind of entrepreneurial spirit Mexico needs. You should make Mexico a place that is as easy to start a business in as it is in California or Texas.
Mexico also needs a better telecommunications infrastructure. Telmex, the recently privatized national phone company, and its competitors, such as Avantel, are slowly building up their capabilities. But they will not soon reach the vast numbers of Mexicans who live in underserved and poor areas.
So you should pay attention to a San Diego company called Tachyon Inc.( which is doing business in Mexico. Tachyon has a contract for using SatMex 5, the powerful Mexican satellite that covers all of Mexico. Tachyon is offering inexpensive two-way Internet service via satellite, and it can serve every town and village in Mexico right now.
The company's vice president, Santiago Ontañon, who is 33 and from Mexico City, told me that its price for broadband Internet connectivity for a typical Mexican school with five to 10 computers is only about $300 to $400 per month. This is thousands of dollars less than what Telmex can offer, and it can happen tomorrow, not in some indefinite future. Incidentally, the ground equipment Tachyon provides its customers runs on Linux.
With the combination of free software and inexpensive Internet connectivity, as well as building on Mexico's Red Escolar (SchoolNet) program for wiring Mexican schools, the country could become the world's leading example of affordable high-tech infrastructure for the rest of the world's developing nations. Moreover, the philosophy behind free, open-source software fits well with your important ideas about a new "open society" in Mexico.
There will be strong pressures, both internally and externally, for Mexico to adopt a conventional model of development, dependent on big corporate players and mega-deals.

Physicist Succumbs to Dangerfield Syndrome
By Mickey Spillane
Affiliated Print Writer
Cambridge, Mass (AP) -  Dr. Phallus Halitosis-Baker today went on a verbal rampage injuring six and boring five others.  Police were called to Dr. Halitosis-Baker's east side home after neighbors noticed him yelling at them that taxes were too low and complaining that they had too many NRA bumper stickers on their gas guzzling sport utility vehicles.  Before being led away to the Orwell Clinic for the critically underestimated, Dr. Halitosis-Baker vowed to return to fight what he calls the oppression of American excellence in science and education.  "It's not fair that I have to come to the United States so I can make good money." Dr. Halitosis-Baker commented from the police cruiser.
An initial diagnosis points to a severe case of Dangerfield Syndrome, named after American comedian Rodney Dangerfield.  The syndrome causes victims to resort to name calling and ad-hominem arguments when they're not accorded the respect they think they deserve.  Dr. Phallus Halitosis-Baker's episode was apparently triggered when a neighbor called Dr. Phallus Halitosis-Baker, Dick and not Dr. Dick as he prefers.  The prognosis looks bright however for Dr. Phallus Halitosis-Baker, especially after technicians cleaned his mouth out with soap and gave him a toothbrush.

[Note from Matthew Gaylor:  Declan McCullagh is Wired News's Washington, DC Bureau Chief and is in Washington State testifying at the Jim Bell trial.  Below is a message Declan sent to me concerning an invitation I sent to Freematt's Alerts and to a few other net mailing lists about the restart of Seattle cypherpunks meetings.  The infiltration of political groups is nothing new going back as far as nations have had secret police forces.  In the late 1980s and early 90s I served as a local Libertarian Party chairman in Ohio (Columbus).  Several strange happenings made be suspicious of several people that were active in the party.  Suspicious enough that it prompted me to file FOIA requests with the FBI.  After the usual several year process I was declined info about spying on the Libertarian Party-  But the FBI did confirm that by releasing the records they did have would have violated the privacy of a third party (The informant).  And yes I think I know who it is and no I won't say because I can't be 100 percent sure.   I have managed to unmask informants and out right agents, once at a machine gun shoot in Knob Creek, KY and once at another local civil rights organization.  I'll be writing a more lengthy response to this.]

"1.2 - Why do people want censorware installed on public computers?
Mostly, because their religious leaders told them so. Actually, there are initiatives to censor both from the far right ("The Bible says sex is evil") and the far left ("We must censor this to protect you"). Both are rather silly. There's never been a single case of information leaping off the screen and beating someone to death or hitting them with a car. Hundreds of people die daily in car accidents, none die as a result of viewing playboy.com. When will the U.S. get its priorities straight?"

My personal rule of thumb is that I don't say anything both online and off that I wouldn't mind seeing on the front page of the local paper.  I can remember being at a CFP a few years ago and having some beer and pretzels with some guys from the CIA who read my list.  Then later I went to a party at Declan's home and ran into a few more Feds and they commented on how much they liked my list.  My general impressions-  The CIA and NSA people were bright and on the ball but the FBI guys seemed more like your run of the mill cop types.  The Custom's guy seemed alright too, we walked out together and as we were walking down the street (In Washington, DC at night- Declan's 'hood seemed safe enough) I noticed he had a fanny pack on.  I commented that at least we'd be safe if attacked-  But he opened it up and just showed me his badge and wallet.  He said left his gun at home as it was too heavy to carry around.
I thought everybody knew the feds read this stuff?

@_subject: New York Times Mentions Matthew (Critic) Gaylor 
CARL S. KAPLAN has an article in the April 13, 2001 New York Time's CYBER LAW JOURNAL: "Law Professor Sees Hazard in Personalized News" which is an overview of Cass Sunstein's theories as contained in his book Republic.com.
Sunstein has a theory in his book "Republic.com" that the Internet allows a "Daily Me" phenomenon where users isolate themselves and watch, read, and communicate only with those who they agree with. This in turn will cause a move towards more extreme viewpoints and less tolerance.  As a solution to his imagined problem, he first wants web sites to link to "opposing" viewpoints voluntarily. And here is a direct quote from Sunstein: "If these routes do not work, it would be worthwhile considering content-neutral regulation, designed to ensure more in the way of both links and hyperlinks."
In other words Sunstein wants to force opinion journals like "The National Review" (An example he uses) to carry "opposing viewpoint" links and hyperlinks.  Needless to say, I first thought his theory of the problem was flawed, as anyone who has spent anytime online can testify.  And I found it idiotic in the extreme that Sunstein thinks the government could be trusted to implement "opposing viewpoint links" fairly.  Can you imagine the time wasted trying to satisfy this new bureaucracy that will have to be created to govern which links get chosen?  Which also does raise the question of who gets to decide what an opposing viewpoint is?  Some issues have multiple opposing viewpoints.  Couldn't you imagine the political ramifications of his plan?  Perhaps the government would only allow legally established parties to be considered as an "opposing view" on political web sites?  Or should a Black oriented civil rights site be legally required to carry KKK or other racist links?
In addition, Sunstein hasn't explained why his theory should or shouldn't apply to print books and magazines?  Could you imagine the mess that would cause?  His theory seems antithetical to private choice and free speech.
Naturally, when I first visited Sunstein's Web site at the University of Chicago  I saw no links to opposing viewpoints.  Since there isn't anybody much worse in my book than a hypocrite, I wrote the professor and requested he add links to opposing viewpoints.   I did this in Princeton Press's online book forum located at:  under the forum topic: "Why not practice what you preach".
I found it troubling that I had to publicly confront Sunstein to get him to test his theory voluntarily, for a theory he thinks should be enforced by law.  But I'm happy that teaching by example is something that Sunstein is apparently willing to try.

Surveillance by Design
WILL A NEW CYBERLAW BYPASS THE U.S. CONSTITUTION?
--BY WENDY M. GROSSMAN
Wendy M. Grossman, who writes about
cyberspace issues from London, is
also on the board of Privacy International
LONDON--A legislative move in Europe that would also affect the U.S. is
threatening the sometimes controversial ability of Internet users to mask
their real-world identities. The move, which is heavily backed by the U.S.
Department of Justice, is the cybercrime treaty, designed to make life easy
for law enforcement by requiring Internet service providers (ISPs) to
maintain logs of users' activities for up to seven years and to keep their
networks tappable. The Council of Europe, a treaty-building body, announced
its support of the cybercrime effort in June.
Anonymity is a two-edged sword. It does enable criminals to hide their
activities. But it is also critical for legitimate citizens:
whistle-blowers, political activists, those pursuing alternative lifestyles,
and entrepreneurs who want to acquire technical information without tipping
off their competitors.
Even without the proposed legislation, anonymity is increasingly fragile on
the Net. Corporations have sued for libel to force services to disclose the
identities of those who posted disparaging comments about them online.
Individual suits of this type are rarer, but last December, Samuel D.
Graham, a former professor of urology at Emory University, won a libel
judgment against a Yahoo user whose identity was released under subpoena.
Services designed to give users anonymity sprung up as early as 1993, when
Julf Helsingius founded Finland's anon.penet.fi, which stripped e-mail and
Usenet postings of identifying information and substituted a pseudonymous
ID. Users had to trust Helsingius. Many of today's services and software,
such as the Dublin-based Hushmail and the Canadian company Zero Knowledge's
Freedom software, keep no logs whatsoever.
But if the cybercrime treaty is ratified, will they still be able to? Would
they have to move beyond the reach of the law to, say, Anguilla? More than
that, will the First Amendment continue to protect us if anonymity is
effectively illegal everywhere else? Says Mike Godwin, perhaps the leading
legal specialist in civil liberties in cyberspace: "I think it becomes a lot
harder for the U.S. to maintain protection if the cybercrime treaty passes."
Godwin calls the attempt to pass the cybercrime treaty "policy
laundering"--a way of using international agreements to bring in legislation
that would almost certainly be struck down by U.S. courts. (On its Web site,
the U.S. Department of Justice explains that no supporting domestic
legislation would be required.)
In real-world terms, the equivalent of the treaty would be requiring valid
return addresses on all postal mail, installing cameras in all phone booths
and making all cash traceable. People would resist such a regime, but
surveillance by design in the electronic world seems less unacceptable,
perhaps because for some people e-mail still seems optional and the Internet
is a mysterious, dark force that is inherently untrustworthy.
Because ISPs must keep those logs and that data, your associations would
become an open book. "The modern generation of traffic-analysis software not
only can link to conventional police databases but can give a comprehensive
picture of a person's lifestyle and communications profile," says Simon
Davies, director of Privacy International. "It can automatically generate
profiles of thousands of users in seconds and accurately calculate
friendship trees."
In the not too distant future, nearly everything that is on hard copy today
will travel via e-mail and the Web, from our medical records to the music we
listen to and the books we read. Whatever privacy regime we create now will
almost certainly wind up controlling the bulk of our communications. Think
carefully before you nod to the mantra commonly heard in Europe at the
moment: "If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear." Do you
really want your medical records sent on the electronic equivalent of
Distributed without profit to those who have expressed a prior interest in
receiving the included information for research and educational purposes.
FOR ME
BUT NOT FOR YOU?
As counterculturalist Stewart Brand has said, anonymity can be toxic to community, because it can foster irresponsible activity and sow mistrust. But an experiment some years back on the WELL, the San Francisco--based electronic conferencing system, showed that people typically wanted anonymity for themselves--just not for others.
PRECEDENTS FOR PRIVACY
In the U.S., the right to be anonymous is protected under the First and Fourth amendments. According to Mike Godwin, author of Cyber Rights, two significant Supreme Court cases establish the precedents.
NAACP v. Alabama The 1958 ruling upheld the NAACP's refusal to disclose its membership lists on the grounds that this type of privacy is part of the right to freedom of assembly.
McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission The 1995 ruling struck down a requirement, instituted to control campaign spending, that political pamphlets include the name and address of their issuer.

Ex-MI6 agent put porn on police computer
BY JOANNA BALE
A FORMER MI6 agent is facing prison after he admitted yesterday downloading
pornographic images of children on to his office computer while working at a
police headquarters.
Alan Coates, 53, a Cleveland police communications manager, was found with
hundreds of explicit pictures of young girls and boys.
Coates, who is married, had earlier stood trial at Newcastle Crown Court on
15 specimen charges of making indecent photographs of children. The jury
failed to reach a verdict and a fresh trial was fixed for November. But
after protesting his innocence for more than three years, Coates pleaded
guilty yesterday to three charges from the original indictment.
The father of two, whose civilian responsibilities matched those of a
superintendent, linked up to pornographic sites using the "America on Line"

@_subject: Cultural libertarianism the real threat to America? 
[Note from Matthew Gaylor: I could have titled this essay Jonah Goldberg doesn't get it.  Mr. Goldberg is the online editor for National Review and has written a series of attack pieces on libertarianism.  Below is the newest example.  I did read one line that jumped from the page that is the crystallization of his view of  "You foster good character by limiting  "I've done lots of things in my life that are "un-conservative." Even now, my personal tastes are not entirely consistent with what most people associate with conservatism."  I can only regard his appeasement a personal rejection of the conservative values he is talking about, which I suppose he made in hopes of still being able to get laid-  But on to the "meat" of his argument-  I'm not entirely sure what ideology Goldberg wants imposed on us?  It surely can't be an American one as outlined in our first amendment" "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances."  I don't see a constitutional mandate to impose any religion on anybody? Nor can I see where limiting freedom by continuing the war on drugs to be anything beneficial?  I really have nothing but contempt and disdain for writers such as Goldberg who want to impose some sort of ill defined governmental "conservatism" while personally considering himself a member of the elite which doesn't have to follows rules made for the rest of the sheep.]

Freedom Kills
John Walker, Andrew Sullivan, and the libertarian threat.
By Jonah Goldberg, NRO editor
December 12, 2001 6:25 p.m.
First, George Bush refers to "the evildoers" at every turn, but insists on pronouncing it "the evil Dewars." And now the major news networks are constantly referring to John Walker, the American Taliban, as "Johnny Walker": "Is Johnny Walker un-American?" "Does Johnny Walker represent a viper in our midst?" etc.
Well, you can count me out of the "war on terrorism" if it becomes a proxy war on our most cherished brown liquors.
What John Walker Says About the Right
So let's talk about John Walker, the man, and leave poor Johnny out of this. Indeed, it's turning out that John is one of the most interesting cultural Rorschach tests we've had in a while.
If you haven't been following the argument, you should read the article in yesterday's New York Times comparing the life of Mike Spann - the "God and country" CIA agent who was killed in Afghanistan - to that of John Walker, the son of hippy-dippy divorced parents from Marin County, California. The article put some flesh on what a lot of conservatives have been saying over the last week. Spann is a red-state guy, Walker a blue-stater. Spann is from Alabama: He's religious, from a strong, stable family, and he always wanted to fight for his country. Walker comes from a wishy-washy, whatever-floats-your-boat family living in the shadow of - where else? - San Francisco.
The always eye-opening Shelby Steele made the definitive "blue state" argument in Monday's Wall Street Journal. In brief, Steele argues that Walker is a product of overly permissive, fashionably anti-American Left-coast liberalism.
Andrew Sullivan, of the coincidentally named AndrewSullivan.com, also saw Walker's obvious cultural significance, labeling him a poster boy of blue-state culture. But Sullivan then backed off from the "blue state" argument, after his readers persuaded him that he had it wrong. The Walker case is "much more complex and more interesting than my original impression," Sullivan writes. One of the arguments that persuaded him to drop his "blue state" analysis is the fact that Walker became a "right-wing" fanatic. He excerpts a letter from a reader making this case:
Maybe I missed something, but I am not sure how a religious fundamentalist and zealot like John Walker is an embodiment of the American Hating Left. He is a right wing religious nut just like the guy arrested here in Cincinnati last week for sending fake anthrax to abortion clinics. While you may be correct that his permissive parents and his multicultural context may have produced him (sounds like something some right wing nut case would say about homosexuality, right Andrew?), what it produced was a right wing Islamic religious nut who hates the West and America for its decadence (which he enjoyed and benefited from) and sin, just like his brothers on the right wing Christian extreme (like maybe Tim McVeigh, who was a Catholic to boot?). Let's at least be honest that Walker represents some of the worst of American permissiveness and multiculturalism, while being the embodiment of right wing religious fanaticism. I think we all get caught on this one.
The lefties, meanwhile, have been slow out of the gate, but basically think that tagging the Left with Walker is just so much McCarthyism. But that's not what I want to talk about.
The Problem of Andrew Sullivanism
What I do want to talk about is the problem with the conservative critique of Walker and with Sullivan's approach in general.
It's not surprising that Sullivan changed his mind after reading that letter. After all, he had already made it a project, if not a mission, to establish that so-called "theocons" (i.e. religious conservatives, particularly Christian ones) practiced a form of Talibanism - long before most people in the United States had ever heard of the Taliban.
For example, in the cover story for the current New Republic, on the future of conservatism, Sullivan uses the war on Islamic extremists to argue that America, and conservatives in particular, need to drop our own support for such "extremists" at home. "It is hard to fight a war against politico-religious extremism," Sullivan writes, "if you are winking at milder versions in your own political coalition." This is reminiscent of his argument during the Clinton impeachment battles. "For the new conservatives," Sullivan wrote in 1998 in The New York Times Magazine, "the counterattack on homosexual legitimacy is of a piece with the battle against presidential adultery."
Sullivan's essay in The New Republic is certainly worth reading, but in the end his conclusion is that all branches of conservatism are wrong, and that they should basically adopt Sullivan's own quirky, iconoclastic, personal brand of conservatism, complete with his imperative of incorporating gays into the mainstream conservative In a nutshell, this is my problem with Andrew Sullivan's conservatism. He's a brilliant and charming guy. But he seems to reject or critique all forms of conservatism that don't dovetail with his own personal priorities. I'm not referring solely, or even primarily, to his homosexuality or advocacy of gay rights. From what I can tell, Sullivan's conservatism is informed not just by his sexuality but by his Catholicism, his blue-collar British roots, his serious hang-ups about British authoritarian culture, and - not least - by the fact that he's a follower of the British philosopher Michael Oakeshott (if I were smarter and more patient, I think I'd be an Oakeshottian too) and a protigi of the classical conservative Harvey Mansfield. Moreover, Sullivan's conservatism isn't just informed by these things, it's informed by the perhaps insurmountable contradictions between these things.
For example: Oakeshott had a brilliantly nuanced and highly tolerant understanding of conservatism and of liberal society (he believed, I think, that the best metaphor for a good society was a good conversation). Meanwhile, Catholicism is wonderful, but it's hardly a democratic institution. And as for Mansfield, he's a leading opponent of gay rights. Further, anti-traditionalism in Britain may have its uses, but in America anti-traditionalism runs against many of the things conservatives rightly want to preserve. As Hayek pointed out, in America you can be a conservative traditionalist and still be a champion of liberty - because our institutions preserve liberty rather than combat it.
Anyway, my point is: That's all great. These sometimes competing, sometimes complimentary impulses make Sullivan a joy to read (and talk to). But the extrapolation of one's personal beliefs - or, more accurately, one's personality - to a broad universal philosophy is at minimum a form of arrogance, and at maximum a recipe for disaster.
Take me, for example. I've done lots of things in my life that are "un-conservative." Even now, my personal tastes are not entirely consistent with what most people associate with conservatism. But, I do not argue that conservatism would be better off if everybody adopted my own personal choices and tastes. Rather, I try to make the case for old-style conservatism in a way lots of people like me can relate to. The fact that I can't or won't live up to the ideal may make me hypocritical to a certain extent, but that doesn't mean the message is wrong. As the moral philosopher Max Scheler reportedly said: The sign that points to Boston doesn't have to go there.
Sullivan is right to criticize certain conservatives for being too ideological. But what he doesn't give credit for, to these same conservatives, is that a little ideology is always necessary in order to remember what your ideas are.
Chinese-Menu Culture
If Sullivan is guilty of translating his personal priorities into a public agenda, he at least does so by speaking in the vocabulary of morality. His arguments for everything from gay marriage to the war on terrorism are deeply moral and proudly conservative.
The real villains - the ones who take this sort of political solipsism a great deal further than Sullivan - are to be found elsewhere, and John Walker is a logical consequence of their political agenda. You see, the real enemy isn't the cultural liberalism Shelby Steele describes. It's the cultural libertarianism that is rapidly replacing liberalism as the real threat to America, and the true opposition to conservatism.
Cultural libertarianism basically says that whatever ideology, religion, cult, belief, creed, fad, hobby, or personal fantasy you like is just fine so long as you don't impose it on anybody else, especially with the government. You want to be a Klingon? Great! Attend the Church of Satan? Hey man, if that does it for ya, go for it. You want to be a "Buddhist for Jesus"? Sure, mix and match, man; we don't care. Hell, you can even be an observant Jew, a devout Catholic or a faithful Baptist, or a lifelong heroin addict - they're all the same, in the eyes of a cultural libertarian. Just remember: Keep it to yourself if you can. Don't claim that being a Lutheran is any better than being a member of the Hale-Bopp cult, and never use the government to advance your view. If you can do that, then - whatever floats your boat.
Of course, liberalism subscribes to something very similar, but today's liberalism is more of a condescending pose. It finds exotic ideologues - Marxists, black separatists, transgender theorists, whatever - fashionable and interesting as entertainment. The liberals who run the New York Times are simply thrilled to have these sorts of cultural rejectionists at their cocktail parties. But very few of them want their kids to become any such thing. They want their kids to go to private schools, attend an Ivy League or comparable liberal-arts college in New England, and become nice tolerant stockbrokers who are extra-careful to donate generously to the United Way, 'cause that might help people of color.
But, at the same time, modern liberals hate traditional orthodoxies. If you're a pious Zoroastrian, they will show you off to their friends as if you were an exotic fertility mask they bought on a vacation safari. But if you are a pious Baptist, don't wait by the phone, because you won't be invited over at all. And, of course, liberals see no problem with using the government to impose their cultural beliefs on others; they just won't admit that's what they're In this sense, cultural libertarians are less bigoted than their liberal cousins. The libertarians think all ideologies - so long as there's no governmental component - are equal.
But of course, the flip side of this is that cultural libertarianism is essentially a form of arrogant nihilism. There are no universal truths or even group truths (i.e., the authority of tradition, patriotism, etc.) - only personal ones. According to cultural libertarianism, we should all start believing in absolutely nothing, until we find whichever creed or ideology fits us best. We can pick from across the vast menu of human diversity - from all religions and cultures, real and imagined - until we find one that fits our own personal preferences. Virginia Postrel can write triumphantly that the market allows Americans to spend $8 billion on porn and $3 billion at Christian bookstores, because she isn't willing to say that one is any better, or any worse, than the other.
Unreasonable Reason
The leading champions of this ideology are the folks over at Reason magazine. Nick Gillespie, who recently replaced Postrel as the editor, is a voluptuary of the idea that we can all have individualized, designer cultures. While he's got a healthy disdain for identity politics, Gillespie keeps going beyond that, and argues that people should be able to be whatever they want. Perhaps because cultural libertarianism is so popular on the Left these days, Gillespie recently told the Washington Post that he will try to woo anti-drug-war liberals, and others on the Left, to the magazine.
For a long time, but now more than ever, Reason has essentially argued that being a drug addict is a lifestyle choice like any other. Because, hey, who are we to judge? Indeed, Gillespie is very fond of the usual argument of pro-drug libertarians: I've done lots of drugs, and I turned out okay - so why should I tell other people they can't? In the latest issue, featuring a big neon sign spelling "DRUGS" on the cover, Gillespie confesses that when he was younger, he did "pot and alcohol, mostly, but also acid, mescaline, Ecstasy, mushrooms, coke and meth... Mostly I did drugs because they were fun and I liked the way I felt when I was high." In other words, if it's good for me, it's good for everybody.
So what does all of this have to do with John Walker? Well, John Walker's father has told various interviewers that he was just delighted that his son believed in something. He liked the fact that his son had "passion" for something. The fact that it was a thumb-in-the-eye to traditional Western values made him more exotic, to be sure. But that was just gravy.
You don't turn children into responsible adults by giving them absolute freedom. You foster good character by limiting freedom, and by channeling energies into the most productive avenues. That's what all good schools, good families, and good societies do. The Boy Scouts don't throw a pocketknife to a kid and say, "Knock yourself out, kid. I'll be back in a couple hours." The cultural libertarians want to do precisely that.
Someone threw John Walker a copy of The Autobiography of Malcolm X and said, "Knock yourself out, kid." From there, left to his own devices, he slid down a long slope to the Taliban - because nobody had the moral courage or maturity to put him on the right path. He could just as easily have become another Columbine spree-killer, or a drug addict - or, perhaps, a fireman. But any of these, it seems, would be a surprise to his father.
It's hip and cool to say, "Be whatever you want." But - as in the case of the Boy Scout with the pocketknife - it's all fun and games until somebody loses an eye. If you tell kids they can believe in anything (and that anybody who disagrees is a bigot), you will eventually breed a bunch of kids who despise the very openness you Western civilization in general and American culture in particular are remarkably, almost uniquely, open to and tolerant of competing views and faiths. That's wonderful. But pluralism is not, to borrow a phrase, a suicide pact. Chesterton pointed out that when a man stops believing in God, he won't believe in nothing, he'll believe in anything. God isn't necessarily the issue here. But the principle is the same. Humans, especially children, very much want to believe in things. If we don't bother to teach - or impose - certain Western values on our own people, they will embrace values that are neither open nor tolerant. Belief in "something" just isn't good enough.

@_author: Matthew Gaylor 
@_subject: Jonah Goldberg Has It Ass Backwards 
[Note from Matthew Gaylor:  Last Thursday I sent a posting titled "Cultural libertarianism the real threat to America?" See:  by National Review Online Editor Jonah Goldberg where he made the claim that good character is fostered by limiting freedom". Goldberg was quick to point out however that he personally has "done lots of things in [his] life that are "un-conservative." His hypocrisy aside, Goldberg again restates his belief on the merits of limiting freedom by writing "Without character-forming institutions which softly coerce (persuade) kids - and remind adults -...", paradoxically claiming that such "coercion" is needed to foster our "open, free, and tolerant culture over others."...  Ay caramba!  Here we have what is colloquially referred to as compassionate conservatism, the notion that government is a loving father and that it's citizens are it's children. Goldberg aspires to an ideology that isn't even American, an ideology antithetical to liberty, and which is the underlaying ideological underpinning of the totalitarian state.  The great American author James Fenimore Cooper wrote that "Individuality is the aim of political liberty.  By leaving to the citizens as much freedom of action and of being as comports with order and the rights of others, the institutions render him truly a freeman.  He is left to pursue his means of happiness in his own manner."  Goldberg has it ass backwards, it is freedom and the respect of the rights of others that is inculcated in our institutions not the removal of freedom by our institutions that makes American culture superior.  It is said that the road to hell is paved with good intentions or as the great American libertarian writer  H.L. Mencken opinioned "Whenever A annoys or injures B on the pretense of saving or improving X, A is a scoundrel ."  So to Jonah Goldberg, I say go to hell.]
The Libertarian Lie By Jonah Goldberg, NRO editor
Responding to Nick Gillespie and Virginia Postrel.
Jonah Goldberg can be reached at (JonahEmail at aol.com).
December 18, 2001 3:35 p.m.
EDITOR'S NOTE: Yesterday I responded to Andrew Sullivan. Today I respond to the libertarians, primarily Reason magazine editor Nick Gillespie and former Reason editor Virginia Postrel. Virginia, whom I consider a friend, has also linked to numerous other sites taking me to task. I know that many readers are uninterested by these doctrinal squabbles. But others are, and I think they're worthwhile. Regardless, I promise this is the last you will hear from me about such things for a while. I'll be getting back to meat-and-potatoes G-Files starting tomorrow.
Lighten Up, Libertarians
Before we get to the heart of all this, let me address perhaps my biggest peeve about libertarians. Trust me, it's relevant. They are, without a doubt, the most defensive and thin-skinned group on the Right - far more so than Christian conservatives, gay Republicans, whoever. Maybe it's because so many of them became libertarians in the first place in order to escape criticism of any kind, or maybe it's because there's something about libertarianism that excites the region of the brain responsible for religious utopianism, or maybe it's the accumulated resentment at being in the backseat of the right-wing coalition - I don't know. But I am continually amazed by how so many libertarians can maintain a tone and posture of reflexive defensiveness and moral superiority, simultaneously.
Out of the hundreds of e-mails I got from angry libertarians, a sizable majority simply asserted that I didn't understand libertarianism. Not that I was wrong in the application of my analysis, or that I was being unfair or overly broad - but that I simply don't "get" it.
Now, as I conceded yesterday in my response to Andrew Sullivan, last Wednesday's column was not surgical in its argumentation, so I'm open to some thoughtful criticism on that score. But I get these letters anytime I write anything critical of libertarianism. Liberty magazine runs regular squibs mocking me for my obtuseness. Harry Browne, the 2000 Libertarian Party candidate, went out of his way to lecture me - on NRO - to explain how I don't get it.
Virginia Postrel suspects that my "anti-libertarian outbursts" stem from a desire to get her and other libertarians to link to my site. Well, we can put aside the suggestion that it's a web-traffic bonanza to get linked on something called "Libertarian Samizdata" (I actually lose traffic when I indulge my anti-libertarian bent). But Postrel seems to believe my arguments are so silly that they're better explained by some sort of cynical ploy. Hell, I've even got my own Greek chorus at LewRockwell.com, which can barely go a week without singing some tune about how I'm slow on the uptake (or how Abraham Lincoln tempted Eve into taking a bite of the apple).
So let me just say once and for all: I'm sorry, but your philosophy ain't that complicated. I think I've got a handle on it: The government uses force, so we should keep it limited; open society; maximize human freedom; respect contracts; free minds, free markets, blah blah blah. I get it. Good stuff. Thanks.
In fact, I thought the whole point of libertarianism was that it's simple. I mean, whenever I hear libertarians trying to convert people, they always make their creed sound so uncomplicated. They begin their sentences with, "We libertarians simply believe X"; or, "Libertarianism is just a partial philosophy of life." Harry Browne says conservatism is worse than libertarianism because it can't give you "one sentence" answers on every political issue. In fact, he makes libertarianism sound like a warm bath you can slip into to melt all your political cares and concerns away.
And that's all fine. Except for the fact that when criticized, all of a sudden libertarianism becomes this deeply complex body of thought with all sorts of Kantian categories and esoteric giggling about "rational fallibility" flying all about (many of my blogger critics actually sound like self-parodies). On offense, you guys are like the "Drink Me" bottle in Alice in Wonderland, or Morpheus's pill in The Matrix. But on defense, you turn on the smoke machines and cloud the room up with faculty-lounge verbiage. You can't have it both ways.
And besides, there's nothing particularly wrong with simple philosophies - which is why I'm pretty much a libertarian when it comes to the federal government. Regardless, please spare me the more-sophisticated-than-thou crap. When smart people (and I've always said libertarians are very smart) - whether they're Marxists, libertarians, whatever - claim that other smart people "just don't get" very simple ideas, they only lend credence to the impression that their intellectual adherence is the product of a religious impulse. Or, they just sound obnoxious.
Gillespie's Pose
Which brings me, inexorably, to Nick Gillespie's response to my column last Wednesday, which Virginia Postrel tells us is "the best so far (of course)." To his credit, Nick doesn't resort to a fog of jargon, merely a typical tone of smirking self-amusement and condescension (but who am I to criticize tone?). We do actually agree on quite a bit. I've long argued that libertarianism will be the real challenger to conservatism, and I've long conceded that I'm - to use his word - "anxious" about it. Nick makes this observation sound like this is some sort of penetrating analysis of the subtext when in fact it's pretty much just the text.
Let's be clear about a few other observations Nick seems eager to pass off as penetrating insights. He chuckles, "It's a funny thing, but conservatives are never so quick to call Rorschach on one of their own: For instance, when it came to light a few years ago that George Roche III, the fabled president of conservative Hillsdale College, had been carrying on with his unstable and suicidal daughter-in-law for years, that twisted scene carried no definitive ideological import."
It's an even funnier thing that Nick uses this example - since it was National Review, specifically my colleague John Miller, who broke the story of George Roche III in the first place. Not only did NR make a big deal about Roche, we did it first and more than once - despite a long association with Hillsdale College and Mr. Roche. If Gillespie cannot find the "definitive ideological import" in National Review's integrity in policing the Right, that's his shortcoming, not ours.
But then Nick has, I think, a much harder time "getting" National Review than I have understanding Reason. "Nothing exercises National Reviewers quite so much as the sense that despite their standing athwart history yelling stop, it still keeps on a rollin' without them," Gillespie writes. He later adds: "[I]t only makes sense that conservatives and libertarians would start to line up on different sides of the barricades that surround the battleground of individual choice and autonomy."
That's all cute and fine, and I'm sure it plays well in letters to subscribers. But it's worth noting that while I am against drug legalization, Bill Buckley and the editors of National Review called for - and continue to call for - an end to the drug war, and for the legalization of drugs, when Reason was little more than an obscure Nick might read a bit deeper into Hayek as well. Like so many other libertarians, Nick pulls out Hayek's excellent essay "Why I am Not a Conservative" as some sort of grand trump card. I admit this is another peeve of mine, but Hayek did not call himself a "libertarian" in that essay, as Nick gamely suggests. In fact, he explicitly rejected the label, calling it "singularly unattractive." "The more I learn about the evolution of ideas," wrote Hayek, "the more I have become aware that I am an unrepentant Old Whig - with the stress on the 'old.'"
Old Whig just so happens to be the same appellation the founding father of conservatism, Edmund Burke, used for himself - as Hayek approvingly notes several times.
More important, the conservatives in "Why I Am Not a Conservative" aren't even the ones Nick has so many problems with. Hayek was referring to the conservatives of the European tradition (de Maistre, Coleridge, et al), and he was a great deal more generous even to them than the folks at Reason are to the American conservatives of today.
Which is a shame because, as I pointed out in my column last Wednesday, Hayek argued that United States was the one place in the world where you could call yourself a "conservative" and be a lover of liberty - because we want to defend those institutions which preserve it. And that's why - despite a lot of propaganda from the folks at Reason - most conservatives are closer to classical liberals than a lot of Reason-libertarians.
Cultural Libertarians, Again
And that gets us, finally, to the meat of our disagreement. I say "cultural libertarians" are people unwilling to draw value judgments between various personally defined lifestyle choices, or "personal cultures." In response, legions of libertoids cry: "Not fair!" "You're talking about 'libertinism,'" say some. "Libertarians are just unwilling to use the state to coerce others into subscribing to our value judgments," say all.
Again, fine, fine - I get it. But I'm also not talking about most of the people who read my column and refer to themselves as libertarians. Most of these folks are fairly conservative people; they want a smaller government, and, hey, so do I. That's why I put the word "cultural" in front of the phrase in the first place. I'm beginning to think we should simply call such people " anti-state conservatives" and let the Reason types have the "singularly unattractive" label of "libertarian" all to themselves.
The people I am talking about are people like Nick Gillespie and the chirping sectaries on these various blog sites. These people quite proudly proclaim that maximizing individual liberty, and minimizing coercion by the state or the culture, is their mission. It's shouted from the rooftops in just about every issue of Reason. In fact, it's odd that Virginia cites Nick's rejoinder as the best so far - for a number of reasons, among them that he more or less concedes the lion's share of my argument. Nick concedes that he wants to maximize the "right to exit from systems that serve them poorly."
Porn Versus Christianity
Take this porn thing. Virginia is fighting mad at me for writing that she won't draw distinctions between pornography sales and Christian-bookstore sales. But she admits that she has no opinion on the issue, and concedes that many of my libertarian critics think Christianity, even in a liberal order, is a "bad thing." Meanwhile she also raves about this fellow Will Wilkinson who, according to Virginia, "makes the good (and obvious but not to Jonah) point that 'If you ask whether porn or Christian books are better, you have to ask "better in what respect?"'" "Goldberg owes us moral arguments against pornÂ if he wants to be taken seriously."
TouchÃ©, I suppose. But doesn't this make my point? Cultural libertarians are uncomfortable with, and quite defensive about, drawing distinctions between such bedrock components of Western civilization - in this case a little thing called "Christianity" - and the latest installment of On Golden Blonde. According to these guys, the burden is on me to explain why and how porn is worse than Christianity. I'd be glad to do it sometime (though I'm hardly an anti-porn zealot); it doesn't sound too tough.
Meanwhile, let's stay on track. Cultural libertarians, as Nick readily concedes, don't "blindly respect 'established authority' the way conservatives tend to." The "blindly" is, of course, a cheap shot, but we'll let it go. That's my point. We're not talking about the state here; we're talking about the culture - the thousands of ingredients which, in various amounts, combine to form the recipe for Western civilization generally and American culture specifically.
Virginia even faults me for not making the positive case for Western civilization in the same column - which, aside from being a fairly high standard for any argument, also seems to underscore the point that these folks don't see its superiority as a given. To the cultural libertarian, all authoritative cultural norms should be scrutinized again and again.
But just to be clear, some of the ingredients for Western civilization I have in mind are such categories as Christianity and religion in general, sexual norms, individualism, patriotism, the Canon, community standards of conduct, democracy, the rule of law, fairness, modesty, self-denial, and the patriarchy. Obviously, all cultures have these things (or their equivalent). But it is the combination of ingredients - and their relative potency toward one another - that make the recipe for Western civilization unique.
The Libertarian Dodge
It's also obvious that - just like conservatives, liberals, and the unaligned - cultural libertarians like some of these things a great deal, and some only a little, and others not at all. We all have our own suggestions for how we should improve the culture. But when criticized on their cultural priorities, they get all defensive and claim they aren't making a subjective cultural argument. "We're just neutral. We just want the state out of things." But then they go right along mocking the cultural choices of conservatives, and of anyone who respects the established cultural authority more than they do. Nick makes it sound like it's a concession to allow cultural conservatives to make their arguments at all, though I doubt he would be so grudging about allowing a polygamist make his arguments.
Because I won't brag about my past experiences with drugs or extrapolate from those experiences a pro-drug stance, Nick grandiosely says that my hypocrisy is "the vice virtue pays to tyranny" (taking, in effect, the position that current or former gluttons should always proclaim that gluttony is good for everybody). Well, if hypocrisy is such a crime, what about the persistent hypocrisy of those libertarians who say that they are "neutral" on cultural questions while they constantly make undeniably cultural Nick is on record denouncing America as a "grotesquely prohibitionist society" when it comes to drugs, and he's nigh upon orgiastic about the spread of pornography. If the anti-state conservatives who prefer the label "libertarian" want to tell me that the editor of Reason is unrepresentative of libertarianism, fine. But maybe you should consider the possibility that it's you who are unrepresentative of Look, the libertarian critique of the state is useful, valuable, important, and much needed. But, in my humble opinion, the libertarian critique of the culture - "established authority" - tends to be exactly what I've always said it was: a celebration of personal liberty over everything else, and in many (but certainly not all) respects indistinguishable from the more asinine prattle we hear from the Left. (The great compromise between libertarians and conservatives is, of course, federalism see " Among the Gender Personal liberty is vitally important. But it isn't everything. If you emphasize personal liberty over all else, you undermine the development of character and citizenship - a point Hayek certainly Kids are born barbarians, as Hannah Arendt noted. Without character-forming institutions which softly coerce (persuade) kids - and remind adults - to revere our open, free, and tolerant culture over others, we run the risk of having them embrace any old creed or ideology that they find most rewarding or exciting, including some value systems which take it on blind faith that America is evil and, say, Cuba or Osama bin Laden is wonderful. That's precisely why campuses today are infested with so many silly radicals, and why libertarians in their own way encourage the dismantling of the soapboxes they stand on. For cultural libertarians this is all glorious, or at least worth the risks. I just wish more libertarians had the guts to admit it. I disagree. I also wish some of them had the guts to admit it.

@_subject: Apologist for the Police State: Goldberg On Ashcroft 
[Note from Matthew Gaylor:  US Attorney General John Ashcroft said "to those who scare peace-loving people with phantoms of lost liberty; my message is this: Your tactics only aid terrorists - for they erode our national unity and diminish our resolve. They give ammunition to America's enemies, and pause to America's friends. They encourage people of good will to remain silent in the face of evil.". Lost liberty is exactly the term a rational patriotic American would use to describe the intrusive power grab that is occurring in America.  National Review Online Editor Jonah Goldberg asks liberals to stop comparing Ashcroft to McCarthy.  A better exercise would be to start comparing police state apologist Jonah Goldberg and John Ashcroft to totalitarians .

Liberals: Stop comparing Ashcroft to McCarthy
Like everyone else, I'd moved on from the public debates over military tribunals, racial profiling, detentions, etc. But, unfortunately, like crabgrass that feeds on inattention, a liberal canard has been growing wildly in the absence of public debate.
That's the trouble with liberal canards. You have to pull them out by the roots when they're young, otherwise they spread all over, crowding out everything else until they become accepted as actual The canard I'm talking about is this idea that Attorney General John Ashcroft is some sort of McCarthyite. Recall, if you will, a few weeks ago the Senate Judiciary Committee invited the attorney general to explain himself.

He knows when you are traveling.
He knows who you're around;
Tried in military courtrooms,
Not a lawyer can be found.
He's makin' a list,
and checking for race,
Gonna arrest those who are dark of face.

You better not pout,
You better not cry.

This is correct-
Col. Cooper had some interesting things to say about the Israelis-
"A couple of correspondents have asked us recently what we think of the Israeli "flat stance" in defensive pistol shooting. If you have seen the training films you know that the Israeli procedure is to rotate the pistol 90 degrees to the left so as to make it easier to operate the slide when the pistol is pointed at the target. It has been pointed out to me that a number of cinema presentations have featured this technique - apparently in an attempt to latch onto anything new.
It happens that Mossad, the Israeli attack squad, fancies the use of the 22 pistol as a murder weapon. This is quite sound when the pistol is used in a totally offensive mode, since the subject is confronted just out of arm's length and hit ten times quickly in the chest area. Ten 22-caliber holes in the thorax are fatal, as any qualified thoracic surgeon will tell you. In employing this system the weapon is carried in Condition 3 until the moment of confrontation, whereupon it is drawn, pointed straight out and the action is racked with the left hand. This is somewhat easier to do if the weapon is held flat rather than vertically. Accuracy does not matter and sights do not matter. Ten quick hits will do the job, whereupon the agent drops the pistol at the scene (for the laboratory to puzzle over) and walks quickly away.
Since the pistol is a totally defensive weapon, this Israeli flat technique is of only academic interest to us."

I wouldn't want to reveal my position to say a burglar with such a pistol-  Any of the other pistols mentioned along with other conventional DA/SA pistols seem to be a better choice.
Keep in mind that Glocks, while excellent, reliable and accurate do lead the pack in accidental discharges, even among "trained" police. I'd not recommend the Glock to a beginner or to someone who wouldn't put in the necessary practice.
The Kahr's are excellent firearms-  Especially if your primary purpose is to conceal it.  However as a general purpose pistol a higher magazine capacity model with better longer range accuracy is Regards,  Matt-

Have you experimented with doing that drill under stress or simulating a hand injury?  I think you'll find the design lacking.
You bring up one of my other objections to the design- The fluted chamber is tough on the brass.  If you don't reload it isn't a problem however, but the fluting puts striations on the brass that weakens it for subsequent use.  I've heard that certain loads (Silvertips) foul up the gas system on the P7 quicker than other designs.  If the P7 works and if your particular gun works for you and your happy with it that's great.  Personally I'd stack up my Sig226 or Beretta 92FS against the P7 anytime.

Press Releases | News About Viisage
GRAPHCO TECHNOLOGIES, INC. Provides Surveillance for Raymond James Stadium to Identify Known Suspects, Deter Crime
On January 28th, Criminals No Longer Another Face in the Tampa Stadium Crowd
Tampa, Florida, January 29, 2001 -Graphco Technologies, Inc. (G-TEC), a leading developer of technology and solutions for biometric authentication, secure access, and expert information-sharing systems, announced today that they provided a surveillance and facial recognition system at both the Raymond James Stadium in Tampa and at Ybor City, Florida. The system was in place from January 21 - January 28, 2001 to monitor potential criminal activities during the sporting events and related activities at the two locations.
In cooperation with the Tampa Sports Authority, Graphco Technologies partnered with Raytheon Company's (NYSE: RTNA, RTNB) Linthicum, Maryland office, Viisage Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: VISG), and VelTek International, Inc., to provide its FaceTrac facial recognition system to the Tampa Police Department and other federal, state and local law enforcement agencies.
"Not everyone comes to sporting events with good intentions," says David Watkins, G-TEC's Managing Director, "The multiple distractions at the nation's premier athletic events provide criminals with opportunities to engage in a variety of illegal activities. G-TEC's facial recognition system provided the Raymond James Stadium with a superior surveillance system that not only captures images of individuals but also compares their facial features against a database of known felons."
The FaceTrac core facial recognition technology provides the ability to locate faces, to build 'face print' templates and to recognize matches to images stored in a database. When integrated with G-TEC's law enforcement database, FaceTrac allows rapid search, comparison and identification of suspect facial photos within the database. FaceTrac may be used for surveillance with multiple locations networked to a high capacity site, for analysis and system-search results. G-TEC installed FaceTrac at the Raymond James Stadium as a single site system, integrated with a custom designed database and search result notifications for tracking faces in a crowd and monitoring access to secure areas.
Tom Colatosti, Viisage President and CEO said, "Places where large crowds are present, such as sporting events, are tempting targets for all types mischief, criminal behavior and larger threats. Using patented Viisage technology, G-TEC has introduced a new generation of tools for law enforcement officials to more effectively and non-intrusively provide for public safety. As an integral partner in the project, Viisage Technology provided G-TEC with the industry's leading and most robust face-recognition technology."
Viisage Technology's FaceFINDER software drives the FaceTrac surveillance and identification process. Viisage's industry-leading face-recognition technology has the world's largest image database deployment in surveillance and investigative applications. Viisage also provided the project with image acquisition and integration technology and services.
During the week of January 21st, G-TEC deployed the FaceTrac system throughout the Raymond James Stadium to detect and identify individuals who are wanted or suspect, and may present a danger to the public. Using standard cameras to recognize human faces during entry to the sporting event, FaceTrac continuously compared faces in the incoming crowd to an extensive, customized database of known felons, terrorists, and con artists provided by multiple local, state and federal agencies. A law enforcement task force of local, state and federal agency personnel monitored the system. Once individuals were matched with photo files in the database, officers of the joint task force, circulating throughout the complex, could be dispatched immediately to make possible arrests, quickly and discreetly.
In addition to installing cameras supplied by VelTek International at the Raymond James Stadium, G-TEC adapted its FaceTrac capability to cameras in Ybor City, Florida to oversee the celebrations before and after the athletic events. Raytheon Company, a global developer and supplier of high-tech products and services, and a G-TEC partner, provided sophisticated cameras and expertise to provide police with exceptional night vision capabilities for poorly lit or darkened areas in Ybor City.
G-TEC, headquartered in Newtown, PA, develops, manufactures, and markets secure database and secure communications systems worldwide. G-TEC combines information sharing, biometric authentication, secure access, and secure data facility technologies to provide technical infrastructure and applications in support of public and private law enforcement, corporate security, manufacturing, and secure web-enabled virtual communities. G-TEC's Intrapol Analysis Center offers secure-access data storage, sharing, and secure virtual community systems to corporate and law enforcement entities at the local, regional, state, national, and international levels. Graphco Technologies is located on the World Wide Web at Viisage Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: VISG), Littleton, Massachusetts, is a world leader in biometric face-recognition technology and in digital identification solutions. Viisage's face-recognition technology is widely recognized as the most convenient, non-intrusive and cost-effective biometric available. Viisage's patented face-recognition technology, originally developed at MIT, and its systems integration and software design capabilities, improve personal convenience, privacy and security while deterring identity theft and fraud.
Raytheon Company (NYSE: RTNA, RTNB), based in Lexington, Mass., is a global technology leader that provides products and services in the areas of commercial and defense electronics, business and special mission aircraft. The company is now successfully expanding its defense technologies into non-defense sectors such as air traffic control, data, image and information management, transportation and communications. Raytheon's Linthicum, Maryland office has expertise in network security and large system development and deployment for both national intelligence and commercial customers, and is the primary Raytheon branch that supported G-TEC's surveillance efforts at the Raymond James Stadium. Additional information is available at Veltek International, Inc. is a leading manufacturer of Closed Circuit Television and security related equipment. Veltek currently offers over 250 different CCTV products through worldwide distribution including standard and specialty video cameras, housings, video signal, remote transmission, digital video streaming and digital storage equipment.

War On Drugs Targets Tech
By Lewis Z. Koch Special To Interactive Week,
The new scapegoat for the failed War on Drugs is, of all things, technology.
The 120-page December 2000 International Crime Threat Assessment report -
created by basically every federal law enforcement agency in the U.S. - is
riddled with examples of how computer technology has advanced the cause of
national and international crime. Modern telecommunications and information
systems, state-of-the-art communications equipment, computers - they're all
to blame.
What the report fails to squarely acknowledge is that the oil that fuels
organized crime in the U.S. and abroad, including terrorist organizations,
is profit from the trade in illegal drugs bound for the U.S. - billions of
dollars in profit from drug sales that enhance the power of international
crime cartels and their ability to corrupt police, judges and governmental
officials from Tijuana to Tanzania.
"Through the use of computers, international criminals have an
unprecedented capability to obtain, process and protect information and
sidestep law enforcement investigations," the report stated. "They can use
the interactive capabilities of advanced computers and telecommunications
systems to plot marketing strategies for drugs and other illicit
commodities, to find the most efficient routes and methods for smuggling
and moving money in the financial system and to create false trails for law
enforcement or banking security."
It goes on to assert: "More threateningly, some criminal organizations
appear to be adept at using technology for counterintelligence purposes and
for tracking law enforcement activities."
In other words, it's not our flawed drug policy that's to blame - it's new
Where All This Began
In 1937, Harry J. Anslinger, six years into his 30-year-reign as director
at the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, testified before the U.S. Senate on
behalf of the "Marihuana Tax Act." This delighted the Hearst newspapers,
which, lacking a real war to increase newspaper sales, launched an all-out
battle against demon marijuana. Here are a few excerpts from Anslinger's
sworn testimony. Clearly, our drug policy traces its roots to reasoning
that was as racist and alarmist as it was wildly inaccurate:
* "There are 100,000 total marijuana smokers in the U.S., and most are
Negroes, Hispanics, Filipinos and entertainers. Their Satanic music, jazz
and swing, result from marijuana use. This marijuana can cause white women
to seek sexual relations with Negroes, entertainers and any others."
* "The primary reason to outlaw marijuana is its effect on the degenerate
* "Marijuana is an addictive drug which produces in its users insanity,
criminality and death."
* "Marijuana is the most violence-causing drug in the history of mankind."
With Hearst's backing, Anslinger's war on marijuana escalated to an all-out
war on narcotics.
Now, after six and a half decades of speeches and hundreds of thousands,
perhaps millions, of arrests, convictions and sentences, what signs point
to even modest success in this multitrillion-dollar war against drugs? Drug
trafficking is the most profitable of all illegal activities, according to
the International Crime Threat Assessment.
Where Do We Go from Here?
Instead of rethinking the sanity of our basic policy on drugs, federal
police agencies appear bent on blaming technology - unbreakable encryption
via e-mail, encrypted cellular phones and faster, cheaper networked
computers - for the losses sustained in the drug war. This is clearly
In 1999 alone, Americans spent an estimated $63 billion on illegal drugs,
according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy. And the National
Institute on Drug Abuse stated: "The estimated total cost of drug abuse in
the United States - including health care and lost productivity - was $110
billion in 1995, the latest year for which data is available."
In addition, a U.S. Customs Service report said the department will soon be
able to inspect only 1 percent of all goods entering the U.S.
This is the score after six and a half decades of our drug policy. Do we
have to wait until 2037 to recognize that we lost the Hundred Years' Drug
War? And,! in the meantime, will we see more and more attacks on technology
as the evil ally of narcotics?
The obvious yet politically difficult solution here is to remove the
profitability factor from drugs. Will there be more casualties? Will more
people succumb to addiction? Maybe. But don't we already have casualties?
You have to employ some tortured logic to rationalize how removing the
profit incentive from drug use could make things any worse than they are.
Now the Feds want to escalate the war as an excuse for having their way
with encryption. But encryption is an essential business tool and a means
of protecting our privacy. Outlawing it as a scapegoat of our drug policy
is like trembling in fear before the great Wizard of Oz and paying no
attention to the discredited man and his policies behind the curtain.

Never say never, especially since drugs had been legal in the United States.  Prior to passage of the Harrison Act in 1914 drugs like cocaine were widely available at any general stores or pharmacy.  And such drugs could be purchased by anyone, including children. Marijuana was criminalized in 1937.
BTW, cocaine is produced legally in some areas (It is used for dental procedures in some nations) and the price hovers around  $10-14 (US) for a kilo.
Incidentally, in the cocaine producing areas such as Columbia and northern Ecuador you can purchase a single kilo of refined cocaine for around $100 (US).

The Onion had a piece a couple of years ago that talked about the Police stopping people to search them for drugs when they see a Greatful Dead sticker on their car.-  A spoof that is all too real- The DEA along with various police training manuals mention to look at what kind of bumper stickers are on cars in order to know what to be on the lookout for.

The CIA for Kids?
The Central Intelligence Agency now has a web site for children.  And I'm not kidding. At their site you can "Fly High On Intelligence, NOT Drugs".  Kids get to learn why the CIA is involved in thwarting nacrotraffic and finding money launders while playing such games as "Break the Code" or the "Geography Trivia Quiz".  Or budding junior spies can bone up with the "Intelligence Book List" or take a virtual tour of the CIA.
Most of the alphabet soup agencies have rushed head long into providing content for children both overtly as evidenced by sites such as the CIA's and much more ominously, covertly.
You may have heard that the White House's Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP)  pays popular Hollywood TV programs to insert anti-drug messages into the story lines of the shows.  After some protests among civil libertarians, the ONDCP in conjunction with the TV producers agreed to mention in the credits that the program was supported by ONDCP. This is the same agency that was forced last June to stop tracking computer users who viewed their anti drug advertisements on the Internet.  Their use violated federal privacy guidelines.  See: What is less widely known and is not in my opinion publicized due to political reasons, is the US Justice Department's practice of inserting anti-gun propaganda in various TV programming. Much of the anti-gun messages are cloaked in anti-violence material.  In 1999 MTV, the popular music television station owned by Viacom International, released a CD Rom titled "Fight For Your Rights: take a stand against violence".  The CD included works by Lauryn Hill, The Dave Matthews Band, Everclear, The Backstreet Boys, Alanis Morrissette, Tori Amos and included sound bites from other popular artists.  Adam Yauch of the Bestie Boys on track 13, the last track of the CD, mentioned that the only way to stop violence was to ban I received my free copy of the CD-Rom directly from the US Justice Department's Office of Juvenile Justice.
And nary a ripple surfaced last year by the mainstream media when it was revealed that the US Army's Psychological Operations Units do Internships at CNN and other news outlets.
In March of 2000 I posted some information to my worldwide mailing list, Freematt's Alerts, on the subject of Psychological Operations On The Internet. I had posted some information on UKUSA's Echelon, the global spy network.
I posted some info from John Young's  excellent site:   In particular I posted this quote from  hmhd.htm
"They constantly broadcast disinformation to television and radio audiences in Haiti, Serbia, Colombia, Mexico and elsewhere."
Lo and behold, I got contacted by a member of the US Army Reserve's 246th Psychological Operations Company from Columbus, Ohio who took exception with that comment.  His title is All-Source Intelligence Analyst and Psychological Operations Specialist.
He claims to have contacted me as a private citizen and he mentioned that he didn't tell me anything that wasn't open information. I engaged with him over several emails then I switched into an IRC channel for a couple of hours and I quizzed him on several issues that some of you may find noteworthy.  I'll refer to him as Agent X out respect for his privacy.
I find it interesting how people with very little information about what information the U.S. Actually does put out are so quick to judge.  The USIA/USIS and Army Psyop do try to  earn people's support for U.S. policy.    This "disinformation" that is put out is Mine awareness so that children don't end up dead or maimed, they try to get civilians to clear military convoy routes so that relief aid can be  transported to the needy, like the orphanage in Haiti that had run out of food because a tropical storm had knocked out the bridge on the only road to  them.  The U.S. did not engage in the use of the Internet as an information tool in Bosnia as the legality of the issue was still under debate.  Under U.S. law and Army Policy no Psyop may be conducted on U.S. citizens.  The internet being an open medium would have allowed U.S. citizens to be subjected to the information.  As such the internet was not used.
An article written about my Psychological Operations Unit in Haiti:
Matthew Gaylor's response: I opinioned that sending troops down to Haiti to perform community service seems like a total waste of money as the service could have been done by a well equipped Boy Scout Agent X continued:
The goal of psyop is to win the hearts and minds...the nuns were greatful...do you think they supported our mission there after that? My  units mission is tactical meaning we coordinate radio broadcasts, distribute  fliers and do loudspeaker broadcasts.  I know the internet was not used for  psyop in bosnia for a fact.  The army was still developing its policy on that  medium.  There is a terrific after action report online that discusses the failure of the US to seize this medium.
This is the end notes that discusses the internet failure.  I warn you its  quite dry and the psyop bit is towards the end.  At the base of the page is  URLs to the rest of the site for the full article.
Matthew Gaylor responded:
I can fully believe that the Internet wasn't used in Haiti, after all it isn't used in Cuba either, because hardly anybody has a decent supply of toilet paper let alone Internet access.
Agent X responds:
As to the internet and haiti... the comment had to do more with our supposed  "disinformation" then on the use of the internet but you're right in Haiti that would be a poor medium.
The US is just now bringing its Psyop units up for capability to use the  internet.  All information distributed must be approved by the National  Command during peace time.  SO everything we get is drawn up by others.  That  way the entire campaign is coordinated effectively and no messages that would  offend are put out.
What I'm saying is that up to 1997 the US had not been involved in psyacts on  the internet.  That was Bosnia...now as to Kosovo in 1999 the situation
hasn't changed much...but we will use any means to cripple an enemies communication systems...such as denial of service and such in serbia.
The following interchanges occurred between myself (Wagthedogy) and Agent X using an instant message service. Some of the comments started out specific to Ohio, but then branched out.
Wagthedogy:	What does Sen. Mike Dewine (R) Ohio have?
Agent X:	Influence in Washington
Wagthedogy   I mean, what issues?
Agent X	He's pretty standard party line republican
Wagthedogy: You mean gun control, larger government etc.?
Agent X:	well theoretically...republicans want smaller government
Wagthedogy:  Don't listen to what they say watch what they do.  In psyopps you should know that.
Agent X:	yes but I'm not a total libertarian either
Agent X:	is why I pick and choose
Wagthedogy:	It doesn't matter how libertarian you are.  What matters is if you believe in freedom and the constitution.
Agent X:	I believe in strong national defense
Wagthedogy:	Me too
Wagthedogy:	But we have troops in Columbia fighting the drug war as an example.
Agent X:	we provide MI support
Agent X:	and occasionally we send units to train with the columbians
Wagthedogy:	Delta is on the ground in Columbia running missions
Agent X:	Yes and usarso has done it too and one of my good friends was there.
Wagthedogy:	What major issue to you differ with the Libertarians?
Agent X:	yes but I don't think we should have no government either
Wagthedogy:	Me either
Agent X:	I believe in some foreign aid and intervention
Wagthedogy:	How much and to who?
Agent X:	To any ally strategically of interest to us. Georgia is a huge one at the moment. It is important we keep russia from redominating half the world
Wagthedogy:	Like Chile?  Kissinger once remarked it was a giant dagger pointed towards antarctica Wagthedogy:	3 billion to Israel?
Agent X:	Georgia is at the center of a sphere of influence that surrounds the majority of the worlds oil.
Wagthedogy:	Here's a question for you.  What is your world view? What do you believe?
Agent X:	world view? meaning?
Wagthedogy:	Ideology, culture, religion, you're relationship to others, etc.
Agent X:	As an american I was brought up in one of the most ethnocentric cultures in the world as to religion I'm atheist as to a christian god...agnostic as to a God. I was raised lower income protestant Am now middle income. Is that what you wanted to know or?
Wagthedogy:	What about your political ideology.  What thinkers/writers have influenced you?
Agent X:	well not really political but I like Nietzsche...as to politics I haven't read much I've read Machevellis "The Prince", Thomas More's "Utopia", I've read Brave New World, 1984, Fahrenheit 451, Animal Farm...all those sorts of things.
Wagthedogy:	That's a good start.
Wagthedogy:	Do you plan to enter the Army full time?
Agent X:	no...having dual job specialties in the army...with psyop and mi always short handed I can be on active duty as much as I Agent X:	SWIC is the Special Warfare Instruction Center...well the John Fitzgerald Kenenedy SWIC...its at Ft. Bragg anyway their website will probably tell you more
Wagthedogy:	What schools in the Army have you been to?
Agent X:	basic training ft leonard wood, ait ft huachuca - all source intel analyst course,basic airborne ft benning,jrtc ft polk, ft knox psychological operations specialist.
Wagthedogy:	I sure hope you didn't help set up the loudspeakers at WACO
Agent X:	No
Wagthedogy:	That's an example of psyopps.
Agent X:	if any psyop was there at all it was the 321s or 5th I forget out of dallas. But I'm pretty sure that was FBI stuff not Army. National guard was there but they have no psyop assets. For psyop to have been there they would have had to be called up by presidential order.
Wagthedogy:	FBI with Delta advisors.

HAND OVER YOUR KEYS
Protecting privacy could soon be more difficult in Britain than anywhere in
the world, warns Caspar Bowden. Internet users may end up with fewer civil
rights than terrorists
[a review of]
"Crypto" by Steven Levy, Viking, $24.95, ISBN 0670859508
SINCE the Second World War, international communications have been hoovered
up from undersea cables and microwave links, and increasingly from computer
networks and mobile phones. Sorted and sanitised, they become the
intelligence reports intended for the eyes only of government ministers. In
Britain, the agency that performs this work is Government Communications
Headquarters (GCHQ) in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire.
It was here in 1969 that the mercurial scientist James Ellis invented
"public key" cryptography, a revolutionary code that allows secret
communication without sharing a secret key. As a direct consequence,
Britain acquired a new law last year that compels the surrender of computer
passwords, even by people not suspected of any crime. It means two years in
jail if you refuse, and another five if you breach a secrecy order and
complain publicly.
The story of what's brought us to this extraordinary state of affairs is
told in Crypto. Written from an American viewpoint, it relegates GCHQ to an
appendix and begins instead with the independent rediscovery of public key
cryptography in 1975 by Whitfield Diffie, a Stanford computer scientist.
Ever since, Diffie has championed the public's right to use it to protect
individual privacy.
How is it possible to devise a code that does not require the sender's
choice of key to be shared with the receiver of the message? The answer,
realised by both Ellis and Diffie, is for the receiver to construct a kind
of puzzle that the sender uses to scramble messages in a way that cannot be
reversed unless you know the trick of the puzzle. GCHQ worked out the
details (which involve enormous prime numbers) a few years before Diffie
and others in the US. But it was the Americans who were granted patents on
the underlying mathematics.
These algorithms are now fundamental to Internet security and e-commerce.
Before you enter a credit-card number on the Web, there should be a padlock
in the corner of your browser to tell you that all transactions to the
website are now scrambled. In that case, all the computers of the US
National Security Agency (NSA) will not be able put the pieces back
together again.
Whitehall's confederacy of dunces simply did not know what to do with this
invention. Not only did it let the American patents go unchallenged, it
also kept the achievements of the GCHQ scientists an official secret until
1998. The US successfully prevented the proliferation of these techniques
for more than a decade, using export controls, until a computer program
called Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) found its way onto the Internet in 1991.
Its author, Phil Zimmerman, was arrested for "munitions smuggling", and
prolonged Kafkaesque investigations made him an Internet folk hero.
Ironically, he was motivated by worries about computer networks becoming
embedded in society, and the totalitarian consequences if these were
systematically exploited for surveillance.
Last year, Britain belatedly abandoned an Orwellian scheme for "key
escrow", which would have meant the prior deposit of everyone's keys with
government. But now it has the Regulation of Investigatory Powers (RIP) Act
2000. Any public authority can demand keys, and can even keep this a secret
by using a gagging order "to protect investigative methods". The only
redress will be through a complaints tribunal that can hear secret evidence
which cannot be cross-examined. These powers are due to be activated in
October 2001, when the next general election should be safely out of the way.
The RIP Act can also require Internet service providers to install "black
boxes" that relay Internet wiretaps direct to the MI5 building, home of the
British security service. The Home Secretary says these powers are
necessary for catching drug dealers and paedophiles. But this will leave
every Internet user with fewer civil rights and safeguards than are now
enjoyed by terrorist suspects or asylum seekers (and for this Home
Secretary that is saying something). Even more staggeringly, a leaked
submission from the police and intelligence agencies to the Home Office
recently revealed that they aspire to a seven-year computerised archive
logging all phone calls, e-mails and web browsing. When online, this
amounts to surveillance of your stream of consciousness without a warrant.
Crypto is a well-researched book. Its one flaw is its exclusively American
perspective, which means that it overlooks the most repressive Internet
legislation anywhere in the world: the RIP Act 2000.

@_subject: John Ashcroft 
I happened to catch some of the confirmation hearings on CSPAN last night.  Of particular interest was John Ashcroft's responses to Dianne Feinstein's, (D-Calif.) questions.  Basically Ashcroft stated that both Brady and the assault weapon bill are constitutional and that he supported their continuance.  He said something to the effect that "We need to move forward on these issues". He also mentioned that he favored closing the "gun show loophole" (A view shared by Republican sellouts).
On both 1st and 4th amendment issues, John Ashcroft has one of the worst records on Capital Hill. Ashcroft sponsored the "Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation
Act" would have criminalized certain drug- and drug policy- related discussions on the Internet, and would have allowed police to conduct secret searches of homes, with the residents never being informed before or after that the police were there.
It is my opinion that Yale grad Ashcraft is a phony conservative (aside from the abortion issue) and phony constitutionalist.
Please visit  today and help stop the appointment of John Ashcroft as Attorney General -- or, just call the Congressional Switchboard at (202) 224-3121, twice, have them transfer you to each of your two Senators in turn, and urge they vote "no" on the Ashcroft appointment.

Proliferation of Surveillance Devices Threatens Privacy
Joint Statement of House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-TX,
And The American Civil Liberties Union
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Wednesday, July 11, 2001
WASHINGTON -- Over the past several days, a troubling expansion in the way technology is being used in the surveillance of ordinary Americans has come to light. In response, we are today joining together to call on all state and local governments to stop using these dangerous technologies now before privacy in America is so diminished that it becomes nothing more than a fond memory.
Majority Leader Armey will ask the General Accounting Office to study the extent to which the federal government is funding facial-recognition technologies. In addition, he will ask the relevant House Committees to hold hearings on law enforcement use of surveillance technology. The ACLU supports these requests.
Tampa, Florida drew attention to the importance of these issues with its highly publicized use of facial recognition technology during this year's "snooperbowl." The city recently took the next step by using the software to scan individuals in an entertainment district. Virginia Beach announced this week that it will seek state funding to install similar facial-recognition cameras in its oceanfront areas.
In Colorado, the Department of Motor Vehicles is moving ahead with a plan approved by the Legislature to create a database containing computerized three-dimensional facial maps of all those applying for driver's licenses.
There is an alarming potential for misuse of all of these systems. Used in conjunction with facial-recognition software, for example, the Colorado database could allow the public movements of every citizen in the state to be identified, tracked, recorded and stored.
These surveillance systems are ineffective and will lead the police to stop people who have done nothing wrong. According to the Los Angeles Times, a recent study by the National Institute of Standards and Technology found that digital comparisons of posed photos of the same person taken 18 months apart triggered false rejection by computers 43 percent of the time. Police relying on this technology will be led too often to stop and question the innocent instead of the suspect.
These cameras do not generate suspicion adequate to trigger a law enforcement stop. Instead, they may lead to high-tech "racial profiling" should surveillance cameras be placed in areas populated primarily by members of ethnic and racial minority groups.
We are extremely troubled by this unprecedented expansion in high-tech surveillance in the United States. We believe that technology should not be used to create a "virtual line up" of Americans who are not suspected of having done anything wrong.
The threats to privacy in America are all too real. We believe the privacy risk outweighs any benefits that these devices may offer. It's time to take notice of what has happened to privacy in America The ACLU of Florida has asked Tampa city officials for additional information about what its facial recognition program.

@_subject: Slashdot | Recording Police Misconduct is Illegal 
In Ohio curiously enough, it is legal to record as long as one of the parties involved know that there is a recording being made.  So in Ohio recording the police would be OK as long as you personally do the recording.  However, this spring near the Ohio State University, there had been an on going problem with out of control drinking parties that spawned setting fires, turning over cars, and tossing bottles and rocks at the police.
Over the years the police have responded with riot tactics, liberal use of pepper spray and giving students and residents free civic lessons on what happens when you're on the wrong side of a PR-24 or ASP baton. Which in turn has caused a plethora of civil rights lawsuits many being settled out of court and the city routinely hands out millions each year to settle claims.  What I did find surprising this year was watching a TV news video of the police spraying pepper spray from a fire extinguisher size sprayer at residents filming the police in action.  The police spokesperson said something to the effect that "The public has got to understand that it is just unacceptable to videotape the police from a porch in a riot situation."  The resident got sprayed on his own porch, not doing anything more violent than filming the Police.  This must be the latest technique to minimize another Rodney King episode from happening in the first place...Just think what might have happened if the King chronicler got peppered with a few large bursts.
So I guess the moral of the story is that if you must record the police you should do so clandestinely.

THE FBI AND THE X-FILES
The recent troubles of the Federal Bureau of Investigation are a far
cry from the nearly unanimous praise the agency received from the
federal government and the media for most of its life. Yet judging by
the popularity of the Fox-TV show "The X-Files," the American public
entertained doubts about the FBI years before it had heard about
Robert Hanssen, Wen Ho Lee, or the agency's missing firearms and
laptop computers.
What a tidal change. Before the show debuted, Fox executives worried
that the show's political undertones, implying that the FBI routinely
withheld Important News from the public, would turn off too many
viewers. Today, we know "The X-Files" was the hit that put Fox on the
"One can see what an extraordinary development 'The X-Files'
represents in American popular culture by concentrating on the fact
that, for all its science-fiction and horror elements, it is
fundamentally a series about the FBI," writes Paul Cantor in the
summer issue of THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW.
"As a TV advertiser might put it, however, this is not your father's
FBI -- and certainly not J. Edgar Hoover's. Far from being the hero
of the series, as one might expect on American television, the
federal agency is virtually the villain."
And the FBI's television villainy was not limited to bureaucratic
incompetence, although that was one aspect. "As the series developed,
it began to suggest that the opposition to [main characters] Mulder
and Scully is the product of sinister forces working within the FBI
or at least exerting pressure on it from other branches of the
federal government. We gradually learn that this agency, which more
than any other over the years has represented the federal
government's ability to uncover threats to its citizens is being used
as part of a plot to cover up the greatest threat the American people
have ever faced -- a worldwide conspiracy to aid aliens in taking
over the earth."
"Alien takeover" aside, the reality of the FBI's problems may simply
be inherent in the agency's operations as a government bureaucracy
subject to political whims and pressures.

Delegitimation of the Nation-State" by Paul Cantor (THE INDEPENDENT

Internet Security and Privacy Special Events
Software Development Forum Special Events
July 31st Event
A decade ago, Philip R. Zimmermann released an encryption program, Pretty Good Privacy (PGP).  For that, the Federal government charged him with violations of the Arms Export Control Act for munitions trafficking.  The government held that U.S. national security was jeopardized when PGP was spread around the world as free encryption software.  The case against Phil Zimmermann continued for three years. Without a paid staff, without a company to stand behind it, without sufficient funding, and despite government persecution, PGP became the most widely used email encryption software in the world. The feds eventually dropped their case against Phil Zimmermann.
Phil Zimmermann will make a rare appearance on Tuesday, July 31st in San Francisco to talk about encryption and the federal government's attempts to control the free speech of programmers through the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).  Mr. Zimmermann will also discuss the OpenPGP email encryption standard alliance, the future of public key encryption, and answer questions from the audience.
We are bringing in leading experts in many aspects of Internet Security and Privacy to discuss how to protect yourself and your customers against attacks over the Internet.  They will explain which threats you should pay attention to first, and how to reduce your risk.  Organized by Montebello Partners and PaperlessInvoice, our three special events will focus on the technologies for public key infrastructure, securing credit card information and transactions, and securing your network against intrusion with firewalls and virtual private networks.  Our speakers will provide a top-level view of best security practices, as well as practical technical advice on designing, implementing, and managing secure systems.
In addition, these events are a great opportunity to meet your colleagues who are also building and administering the latest Internet systems.  Find out what malicious activity others have encountered, and what they're doing about it.
Please join us, and bring your questions and experiences to share.  For further information, visit our web page, or email our organizers Ames Cornish (ames at montebellopartners.com) or Ira Victor (irav at degrees.com) with questions, comments, or suggestions.

Independent Libraries in Cuba Defy Government's Lock on Information
The movement faces poverty and repression as it collects books from the outside world
By MARION LLOYD
San Juan y MartÃ­nez, Cuba
The smattering of Catholic journals, poetry books, and yellowed Newsweeks that make up Valentin Almiral's provincial library seem an unlikely catalyst for revolution.
But in a country where the government wields nearly absolute control over information, the former biology teacher's private collection represents a significant challenge to state authority.
Mr. Almiral's Love, Peace, Democracy, and Freedom Library, housed in a concrete shack on the outskirts of this tobacco-growing town in western Cuba, is one of dozens of independent libraries that have opened in Cuba over the past three years to give scholars and other Cubans access to books that they can't always obtain elsewhere. Most of the libraries are little more than a bookshelf in the back room of somebody's home. But their content -- ranging from light fiction, like detective novels, to hard-core anti-Communist treatises -- and the long list of dissidents involved in the movement have made the Cuban government uncomfortable.
"It's hard not to have the feeling that these people are conspiring with a superpower that has been plotting against Cuba for more than 40 years," says Eliades Acosta, the director of the state-run National Library, referring to the United States. He notes that the vast majority of the independent librarians are active members of opposition political parties. In addition, he says, many openly receive money from Miami-based exile groups to support their dissident activities, as well as help in coordinating book donations.
The movement's founders, Berta Mexidor and Ramon Colas, deny that they have political motives, but acknowledge that the U.S. government helps the libraries with book donations. Both Ms. Mexidor and Mr. Colas, who are married, used to be professors. They say they are merely trying to supplement the offerings at state-run libraries, which have few texts critical of Communism.
Scholars who want access to controversial texts at those libraries must be affiliated with a university and get written permission from administrators in their department, according to diplomatic sources and academics who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Access to controversial books is further restricted by the university-admissions process. In order to be admitted to a university, students must prove that they have not been active in any dissident movement -- a requirement that screens out many Cubans interested in such books.
New books of any kind have been hard to come by since the collapse of the Soviet Union, in 1991, which deprived Cuba of its main supplier of textbooks and paper. "The latest books don't make it into the country," says Noedis Pita, an engineering student at the Jose Antonio Echeverria Polytechnic Institute, on the outskirts of Havana. Although the university -- like the University of Havana -- has an extensive main library and separate libraries in each department, she says her professors had to request copies of newer texts and then make photocopies of selected passages for their students. She studies at central Havana's century-old Masonic Library, which has an impressive stock of 36,000 books, but most date to before the 1959 Cuban revolution.
Ms. Pita says censorship does not tend to inhibit the study of engineering, but friends in political science complain about their lack of access to books on subjects such as capitalist theory. "Many of the books are there, but only certain students can get access," she says. Students skirt the problem by requesting books from family members abroad. Then, if the books somehow slip by the censors who inspect incoming packages, the students circulate them secretly.
Ms. Mexidor, who used to teach economics at the University of Las Tunas, in eastern Cuba, says that what the independent librarians want is freedom from censorship, so "ideology doesn't define what a person can read." She and Mr. Colas say they got the idea for the independent libraries from a remark Fidel Castro made in February 1998, during an international book fair. The Cuban president insisted that "there are no banned books in Cuba, just no money to buy them."
The couple took those words at face value and began soliciting book donations from Latin America, Europe, and the United States. Today, they say, more than 80 such libraries operate around the island, with new ones opening almost weekly.
In the process, however, the movement has attracted attention from the government, always a risky proposition. Soon after the couple opened the first library in their home, in March 1998, Mr. Colas, a former psychology professor, was fired from his job as director of a psychiatric hospital in Las Tunas. The couple were later evicted from their state-run housing in Las Tunas and sent to live on a nearby government farm -- a move that shut down their library. They later moved in with Ms. Mexidor's family, in Amancio, a farming town 60 miles from Las Tunas.
Their story is typical of the other independent librarians, most of whom are academics or journalists who were fired from government jobs after becoming involved in opposition politics. In the past year, the police have detained half a dozen independent librarians, according to reports by the independent CubaNet news service and Amnesty International, and supporters say at least a dozen more have been threatened and harassed. In December, Julia Cecilia Delgado, a librarian and president of the Association for the Recovery of Human Values, a human-rights group, was sentenced to one year in jail for "disrespect," in what supporters assert is punishment for opening a library in her Havana home.
In mid-March, five men said to belong to the government's Rapid Response brigades -- groups of young Communist Party activists who investigate "counterrevolutionaries" -- attacked Mr. Almiral's library here in San Juan y Martinez, ransacked the bookshelves, and beat up several patrons. After Mr. Almiral complained to the police, he says, the men returned the next night and threw sacks of excrement on the walls of the shack.
Following appeals from independent librarians, the International Federation of Library Associations sent a delegation to Cuba in June 1999 to investigate the alleged human-rights abuses. In a September 1999 letter to President Castro, the organization concluded that "the Cuba government has responded to the independent libraries with a campaign of threats, intimidation, detentions, evictions ... and has deprived these people of their jobs." The letter urged Mr. Castro to respect freedom of information and freedom of expression, which it described as "the right of citizens in all countries of the world."
Cuban-government officials say they have no knowledge of any attacks on independent libraries. They also deny any connection between the arrests and the library movement. But they are keenly aware of the movement's potential to attract unwanted international attention.
"We're in the presence of a carefully disguised campaign, which has a big appeal in the world today under the guise of free access to information," says Mr. Acosta, the National Library director. He charges that the movement is based on the false pretense that certain books are unavailable at state libraries. "I challenge you to find a book on [the independent libraries'] shelves that I don't stock," he Critics note that even if a book is listed in the National Library's catalog, that does not mean it is available to the public. A Cuban college student who recently requested a copy of a novel by the exiled writer Guillermo Cabrera Infante was refused by the librarian, who said the book was "counterrevolutionary." George Orwell's classic anti-authoritarian novel 1984 is not listed in the library's card Mr. Acosta blames a budget crunch for the absence of certain books, saying that with limited funds he chooses to stock only those texts that "contribute to upholding the moral fabric of the Cuban state." He also justifies the need to restrict access to anti-Communist texts by saying, "We are in the midst of a war [with the United States]. These are not normal times."
The debate over whether the U.S. trade embargo warrants the Cuban government's clampdown on information was the subject of an article in the April issue of American Libraries, the magazine of the American Library Association. The article took the form of a debate between Robert Kent, a humanities reference librarian at the New York Public Library and a leading advocate of the independent libraries, and Ann Sparanese, a librarian at the Englewood Public Library, in New Jersey, and a member of the library association's Social Responsibilities Round Table.
Ms. Sparanese defended the Cuban government's position, arguing that the independent librarians were more interested in waging politics than in promoting reading. "This is not about libraries; it's not even about intellectual freedom," she argued, adding that none of the people involved in the movement were trained librarians.
She also challenged Mr. Kent's assertion that book censorship is commonplace in Cuba, noting that the government did not confiscate any of the 4,000 books recently delivered to the island by Jarrett T. Barrios, a Democratic lawmaker in Massachusetts.
Mr. Barrios notes, however, that most of the January shipment comprised children's books and medical texts with no political content. He says he was not aware of the independent libraries before his trip. But by going through official channels, he says, he ensured that the books would reach the widest audience. "We have strong feelings about politics, but we also want to encourage democracy from within," he says.
U.S. officials in Cuba take a different view. The U.S. Interests Section in Havana, the only official representative of the U.S. government in Cuba, has actively supported the independent libraries, which officials say will broaden Cubans' knowledge of the outside world and help prepare them for life after Mr. Castro. The office makes monthly book deliveries to independent libraries around the island and weekly deliveries in the capital.
The Martin Luther King II Library, an other independent library in San Juan y Martinez, recently received a shipment that included Tom Sawyer and a set of how-to texts on raising children. Alina Alvarez, the librarian, says she has since requested English-language primers and American-history texts. The books are in high demand in a country where nearly everyone either is planning to emigrate to the United States or is receiving money from relatives already there.
The U.S. Interests Section also distributes books -- including Orwell's Animal Farm; The Power of the Powerless, by the president of the Czech Republic, Vaclav Havel; and politically neutral textbooks

I'm being represented by attorney Robbin Stewart (Brother of Cypherpunk Bill Stewart) in an anonymous speech case as we speak. Robin has had several victories in Indianapolis for anon political speech.  His first victory was inspired from Freematt's Alerts, Robbin had read some commentary from my list on McIntyre v.

Last month, when Citigroup bought Banamex, the second largest bank in
Mexico, the deal was praised as good for the Mexican people and good
for the banks. Citigroup vice chairman Robert Rubin told the press
that the deal was the result of an overture from Banamex chairman
Roberto Hernandez Ramirez, who is worth $1.3 billion and has been
promised a seat on the Citigroup board. On May 18, The New York Times
faithfully regurgitated Hernandez's rags-to-riches success story.
But the fruit vendor turned billionaire has a dark side. According to
statements made in 2000 by Al Giordano, publisher of the Mexican-based
NarcoNews.com, Hernandez has also been called a money launderer and
a drug dealer. Giordano says he has reviewed published photos and
testimony suggesting that Hernandez has shared his Yucatan
beachfront with the boats and planes of the cocaine trade.
Hernandez has denied the allegations since they were first reported
in 1997 by the Mexican newspaper Por Esto! Last summer, after failing
in his efforts to get Por Esto! prosecuted in Mexico, the banker
decided to sue his critics in New York. He hired Akin Gump Strauss
Hauer & Feld, a firm that has represented alleged money launderers in
the past, to file a libel suit on behalf of Banamex. His lawyer calls
the portrayal of Hernandez and Banamex as drug traffickers "utterly
false," and claims that Giordano's comments "injured Banamex's
business reputation"oa conclusion which seems especially odd now that
Banamex has been snapped up by Citigroup for $12.5 billion.
Wherever he found his money, Hernandez has enough of it to sue Narco
News for yearsoor at least until the Web site shuts down. But it would
be a mistake to underestimate my friend Giordano, a respected reporter
and activist who plans to defend himself against the libel charges.
In what is shaping up to be the summer's most entertaining media
trial, Giordano will appear in New York State Supreme Court on July
20, where he plans to throw curve balls during the first round of oral
arguments in the case.
In his motion to dismiss, Giordano chronicles his lifelong commitment
to free speech and claims that every one of his supposedly libelous
statements is what the courts call an opinion, because in each case he
cited the facts on which his opinion was based.
Via e-mail, Giordano wrote that the opinion defense has solid
precedents, including a case in which an umpire sued Yankees owner
George Steinbrenner for mocking his calls as "ludicrous" and
incompetent. Because Steinbrenner referred to specifics to back up his
opinion, his statement was found to be not defamatory. Giordano says,
"We razzed the umpire in this case, the government, which leaves
certain white-collar traffickers alone."
Attorney Thomas Lesser, who represents Narco News, also filed a motion
to dismiss, arguing that the court cannot allow Banamex to sue the Web
site in New York for content uploaded in Mexico. According to Lesser,
that would be tantamount to giving any libel plaintiff permission to
sue any Web site anywhere in the worldoa precedent that would
seriously threaten free speech.
In its response, Akin Gump calls Lesser's argument a "straw man" and
paints Giordano as having superhuman powers to raise money and affect
public opinion. The plaintiff also claims jurisdiction in New York
because Giordano has business contacts and does fundraising here.
It's too early to call a winner, but as of this week, Giordano will
stop posting new reports on his Web site. When he arrives in New York,
he intends to dispense with the technicalities and turn the spotlight
on the drug trade, which is the heart of the case. "We may be
out-hollered and out-dollared," he quips, "but we're not
Unlike Hernandez, who Giordano says is "hiding behind his bank," the
journalist will step up to the plate. "Just showing my face," he says,
"will speak volumes about which side of this dispute is telling the
truth." Given his passionate opposition to the drug war, Giordano
should have plenty of fans cheering from the bleachers.

An American Investigative Journalist Is Being Sued Over His Website's
Reports Of Drugs Trafficking In Mexico. So What Are The Implications
For Freedom Of Speech?
In 1997, a notable Mexican billionaire, Roberto Hernandez, general
director and majority owner of the National Bank of Mexico (Banamex)
and one of the richest men in the world, picked up a copy of Por Esto,
a modest Mexican daily newspaper. In its pages was the first of 15
investigative reports which alleged that he was a major drugs trafficker.
After a lengthy criminal libel trial lasting more than two years, a
Mexican judge ruled that Banamex had not been libelled, a decision
that was upheld on appeal in May last year. A third attempt to press
criminal charges in Mexico was thrown out of court. Hernandez has
never personally filed a libel lawsuit over any of the allegations
made by Por Esto.
It could have ended there and it nearly did. But next month Banamex
will be back in court - this time in Courtroom 205 of the New York
State Supreme Court - and a new defendant will stand in the dock
alongside Por Esto's editor Mario Menendez and his team of
reporters. On July 21, the Mexican hacks will stand
shoulder-to-shoulder with Al Giordano, a US investigative journalist
and publisher of a crusading website,  At stake, say
the defendants, is the future of free speech on the internet.
The Banamex suit charges the journalists with "defamation and
interference with prospective economic advantage", accusing them of
"maliciously smear[ing] Banamex with accusations that, among other
things, it is controlled and operated by narcotics traffickers and has
engaged in illegal activity".
If it hadn't been for Giordano, much of the world would never have
heard of Por Esto's allegations. Since leaving his native Boston, the
former political reporter has been operating - often in secret - deep
in the heart of Latin America's "narco states". He is the sole
publisher of Narco News, a website that aims at the reform of US drugs
policy. It attempts to expose corruption, offers translations of the
Latin press into English and aims to shatter "the illusion that the
drugs war is about combating drugs".
Banamex's lawyers claim that the defamation occurred last year when
Menendez and Giordano went on a publicity tour to New York. The
tour included an interview with Menendez in New York's Village
Voice, a radio interview with Giordano and Menendez, and a lecture
the pair gave at the Columbia University School of Law - all well
within the court's jurisdiction.But crucially, the libel action also
cites a number of articles Giordano published on his website, which is
produced and maintained in Mexico and uploaded to a server in Maryland
USA, not New York.
Speaking from an undisclosed location in Latin America, Giordano told
MediaGuardian: "If the National Bank of Mexico can sue a website
published from Mexico, over stories investigated, reported and uploaded
from Mexico, and sue that website in New York, that would set a
dangerous precedent that chills free speech throughout the internet. If
you say something that a large corporation doesn't like, not only can
you be hauled into court in Mexico, but you can be hauled into court
anywhere in the world."
According to Tamsin Allen, a specialist in media law at City law firm
Bindman and Partners, Banamex is practising a form of "forum
shopping". "It happens quite often," says Allen. "What it means in
effect is that the bank is looking around for a forum which is going
to give it the best result."
Giordano says he left the US because "journalism, as I once knew it,
seemed to be dying". After a year in Chiapas, living with the
indigenous Zapatista rebels, Giordano began operating from his secret
base in Latin America. In a little over a year, Narco News has broken
a string of scoops focusing on the war on drugs. It exposed a
conflict-of-interest scandal surrounding a series of Associated Press
articles about Bolivian politics, which led to the resignation of AP's
Bolivia correspondent, Peter McFarren. It also broke the news that the
president of Uruguay Jorge Batlle has recently begun calling for the
legalisation of drugs.
"None of the stories were about Banamex," says Giordano. "So you have
to ask: why doesn't Hernandez bring the suit himself?"
Narco News will be represented by Charles Nesson, the Harvard law
professor who came to prominence in 1987 when he defended Abbie
Hoffman and Amy Carter in their fight against the CIA. Akin, Gump,
Strauss, Hauer and Feld - the third largest lobbying firm in
Washington with clients including Colombia and Bolivia - will
represent Banamex. When proceedings begin next month the debate will
centre around whether Banamex has acted properly in bringing its
lawsuit in New York, when it has already been defeated three times in
Mexican courts.
In a bid to establish jurisdiction over Narco News, Banamex claims
that it is an "affiliate" of a media watchdog group called the Media
Channel, which is based in New York. "There's no money involved," says
Giordano. "Nobody pays to affiliate with organisations of like
interests. But imagine if affiliation could be used to sue Media
Channel in New York. It will have a chilling effect on media
organisations and citizen groups." Other affiliates include 78 UK
organisations, including Amnesty International, Comic Relief and
Guardian Unlimited.
"If this case is allowed to proceed, it means that any British
website, or any site in the world, could be dragged into a New York
court," says Giordano. "This case is costing me a lot of money that I
don't have. It's costing me time that is taking away from my
journalism, and it's a warning to every journalist that the same thing
will happen to you if you report about the activities of
Despite this, Giordano is relishing the fight. "If we go to trial, the
drug war goes on trial," he says. "This case has many interesting
elements, including photos of cocaine trafficking, and the outrageous
story of Mexican state persecution of journalists for taking such
photos and reporting the facts."
Also, "there is drug-money laundering, including in the tourism
industry, a US president and ambassador who were guests at the accused
trafficker's estate, and official complicity with and protection of
white-collar drug trafficking on both sides of the border."

By the way, the 240 economists who signed The Independent Institute's Open Letter on Antitrust Protectionism ( ) did not "deny the existence of network effects," and if you would simply read the letter itself, you would see this.  In fact, the words, "network effects," do not even appear in the Open Letter!  Furthermore, the Open Letter was not only about the Microsoft case, but as is stated, it was about "Headline-grabbing cases against Microsoft, Intel, Cisco Systems, Visa and MasterCard, along with a flurry of merger investigations now under way." The issue is about "path dependence" theory, not "network effects!"

@_subject: June 2, 1999 OPEN LETTER TO PRESIDENT CLINTON FROM 240 ECONOMISTS 
Concerned about a growing number of antitrust cases instigated by rival business firms, 240 distinguished economists signed an open letter to President Clinton that called for an end to speculative antitrust enforcement efforts. The ad, sponsored by The Independent Institute, appeared in the June 2, 1999, editions of The Washington Post and The New York Times.
AN OPEN LETTER TO PRESIDENT CLINTON FROM 240 ECONOMISTS
ON ANTITRUST Dear President Clinton:
Antitrust is supposed to be about protecting consumers against higher
prices and other consequences of monopoly power.  Accordingly, the Department's Antitrust Division, the Federal Trade Commission, and state
attorneys general are vested with authority to defend competition and
protect the well-being of consumers.
The current spate of heightened antitrust activism seems to suggest anti-competitive business practices abound.  Headline-grabbing against Microsoft, Intel, Cisco Systems, Visa and MasterCard, along with a
flurry of merger investigations now under way, would appear to demonstrate
the need for a vigorously enforced antitrust policy that will create checks
and balances to eliminate consumer However, consumers did not ask for these antitrust actions -- rival business
firms did.  Consumers of high technology have enjoyed falling prices,
expanding outputs, and a breathtaking array of new products and
innovations.  High technology markets are among the most dynamic and
competitive in the world, and it is a tribute to open markets and
entrepreneurial genius that American firms lead in so many of these
industries.  But, these same developments place heavy pressures on rival
businesses, which must keep pace or lose their competitive races.  Rivals
can legitimately respond by improving their own products or by lowering
prices.  Increasingly, however, some firms have sought to handicap their
rivals' races by turning to government for protection.
Where antitrust authorities respond to these protectionist demands, the
workings of markets are short-circuited.  Antitrust protectionism means
that market decisions about how to compete for consumers' favor are
displaced by bureaucratic and political decisions.  More of the energies of
firms are directed to politics, less to production and innovation. Successful innovators are penalized, scale economies are lost, competition is thwarted, not enhanced.  Instead of preventing prices from
rising, antitrust protectionism keeps prices from Many of these cases are based on speculation about some vaguely specified
consumer harm in some unspecified future, and many of the proposed
interventions will weaken successful U.S. firms and impede their
competitiveness abroad.  The cost-benefit test for antitrust has not been
met.  We urge antitrust authorities to abandon antitrust protectionism and
refrain from such speculative enterprises when actual consumer harm cannot
be shown.

@_subject: Why Not debate "network externality"-path dependence? 
It occurred to me that this would be a good topic for an organized online debate.  The results of which could be posted around.
Jim Warren  or "Jonathan Wallace"  would make good and fair moderators-  Jonathan especially so since he has already participated in a similar debate on my mailing list and on his online zine The Ethical Spectacle  . In that debate-  Both participants were lawyers so they wrote rather extensive and good ground rules for the debate.  But any trusted third party would work.
A debate such as this will remove any "heat of the moment" commentary and might provide more light than heat?
What do you think?

Robin Hoods of Cyberspace: A Philosopher Examines the Difference Between Good and Bad Hackers
March 4, 2001
Reviewed by STEVEN JOHNSON
It can sometimes seem as if the number of people who have speculated
on the social implications of Linux, the free computer operating
system collectively engineered by thousands of programmers
worldwide, exceeds the number of people who have actually used
Linux itself. Ever since the open-source software movement entered
into the public consciousness in the late 90's, we've been awash in
prophesies about the end of the Windows era and the birth of a less
proprietary digital age. Together, the emergence of open-source
software and the related Napster music file sharing system
constitute the most significant technological development since the
arrival of the World Wide Web.
  Up to now, most ruminations on the impact of open-source software
have limited their view to the computer desktop itself: does the
stability of the Linux platform prove that open software
development models are intrinsically more stable than the
proprietary ones used by Microsoft? Is there an economic model that
can support the development of free software?
  These are important questions, but they don't do justice to the
most remarkable fact about the open-source movement: at the very
epicenter of New Economy capitalism, something that looks a great
deal like a wired version of communism has prospered beyond
anyone's wildest imagination. While private companies are free to
sell ''flavors'' of Linux, and to sell technical support, no one
owns Linux proper. It belongs to the people. If the Web served as a
launching pad for the Xtreme capitalism heralded in magazines like
Fast Company and Wired, the launching pad itself was partly built
by freely contributed collective labor.
  Itself something of a collaborative project, ''The Hacker Ethic:
And the Spirit of the Information Age'' begins with the premise
that the programmers behind the open-source movement (called
''hackers'' throughout the book) represent a ''spiritual challenge
to our time.'' As Pekka Himanen writes in his preface, ''the hacker
ethic is a new work ethic that challenges the attitude toward work
that has held us in its thrall for so long, the Protestant work
ethic, as explicated in Max Weber's classic 'The Protestant Ethic
and the Spirit of Capitalism.' ''
  ''The Hacker Ethic'' begins with a breezy prologue from the
legendary programmer behind the Linux revolution, Linus Torvalds,
centered on what he calls ''Linus's Law.'' (His theory: people are
motivated by ''survival,'' ''social life'' and ''entertainment.'')
Himanen, a philosopher of technology who teaches at the University
of Helsinki and at the University of California, Berkeley, then
presents a longer essay -- the bulk of the book, really -- on the
core attributes of the hacker ethic, contrasting them with Weber's
work and that of his modern disciples. The techno-sociologist
Manuel Castells arrives in the closing pages to deliver a somewhat
freeze-dried rendition of his grand theory on the difference
between today's ''network society'' and the industrial systems of
  Because Torvalds's contributions are so slender, and because
Castells has presented his ideas elsewhere, ''The Hacker Ethic''
needs to be judged primarily on the substance of Himanen's
argument: that the values associated with the open-source movement
present a significant challenge to the Protestant ethic. While
Himanen's text relies on almost no primary research in terms of
interviewing programmers, his survey of the core components of the
hacker ethic (which he calls the nethic) is as comprehensive and
instructive as any to date. Unlike the dutiful labor of Weber's
Protestant ethic, the nethic embraces flexible hours, creativity
and a passion for one's work. The nethic also disdains monetary
reward for one's achievements, preferring what the open-sourcers
call Egoboo -- the respect of one's peers. While Himanen can
present a strained image of hacker sainthood, he makes a persuasive
case that the nethic stands in direct opposition to the Weberian
  But that opposition raises two questions. First, is the Protestant
work ethic still a useful category in modern industrialized
societies? Weber's theory had little room for today's frenzied
leisure-time consumption. (Sunday was a day of rest -- not the day
for PlayStation 2 and Old Navy.) We may be programming our TiVo's
with time-management skills that would have made the efficiency
expert Frederick Taylor proud, but surely there's a difference
between using those techniques to tape episodes of ''Temptation
Island'' and using them for crop rotation. The dominant culture may
still be clinging to older, Weberian notions of labor-as-duty, but
it certainly spends a great deal of energy persuading us to kick
back and live a little on the weekend. Himanen avoids dealing with
the prominence of today's consumer society by wishing it away with
the old ''false consciousness'' dismissals: ''Only when work uses
up all energy and people are too tired to enjoy the pursuit of
their passions are they ready to be reduced to the passively
receptive state suited for television.'' In other words, that
feeling you have of actually enjoying ''Seinfeld'' reruns -- that's
just an illusion.
  But even if you accept Himanen's most optimistic scenario -- a
band of impassioned hackers challenging the oppressive
establishment -- the question remains: What does it mean for the
rest of us? Can the playful, work-for-art's-sake nethic be
transferred to the analog world? For anyone who is excited about
the promise of the open-source revolution, that may well be the
most provocative question of all, and Himanen has meager answers
for it. ''The hacker open model,'' he writes, ''could be
transformed into a social model -- call it the open-resource model

Trampling on the theory of path dependence
Microsoft's judges may decide that consumer approval rather than illegal tactics led to the company's power
Published: March 5 2001 19:49GMT | Last Updated: March 5 2001 20:07GMT
[amity schlaes]
Microsoft looks as if it may evade the dismemberment ordered in the finding sent up by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson. Not only have federal appeals court judges shown some sympathy for the company's case, but the Bush administration may also revise antitrust policy and offer it a settlement. Microsoft stock's recent rise reflects these new prospects.
But what about the underlying theory that convinced Judge Jackson that Microsoft needed dismantling in the first place? He leaned repeatedly towards an economic idea known as path dependence.
The position that the appeals court or the Justice Department take on this issue will do much to determine Microsoft's fate. Path dependence is also a key part of modern monopoly theory generally, so has a bearing on other antitrust cases.
So what precisely is it? Path dependence says that a company may gain an overwhelming advantage in a market if it manages to establish an industry standard before anyone else. That standard then becomes so powerful that it becomes a barrier to better challengers. The company, in short, creates an impregnable monopoly.
The textbook example here has long been the qwerty keyboard. Its critics argue that it is less efficient than other key arrangements. Their position is that it has dominated for a century merely because one of the first manufacturers of the manual typewriter, E. Remington, adopted it early on, ensuring that it would become the standard. Path dependence emphasises, sometimes close to exclusively, the competitor as victim. Consumers are part of path dependence theory too - but only indirectly; they lose because the competitor Bunkum, say two professors of economics, Stan J. Liebowitz of the University of Texas at Dallas and Stephen E. Margolis of North Carolina State.* Markets are meritocracies where good products win, be they mouse traps or operating systems. An item's success is due more to its quality than to any industrial predation.
Start with the qwerty keyboard. The professors argue that qwerty was hardly the competition-free gladiator that received wisdom makes out. It turns out that there were 51 rivals to Remington's qwerty at the outset. Remington's qwerty prevailed not because of market share alone but also because qwerty typists won at much-publicised typing Then there is the showcase argument against qwerty: DSK, a keyboard arrangement patented in 1936 by ergonomics expert August Dvorak. Dvorak tested DSK in Chicago schools and found data indicating its superiority. In the second world war, DSK was pitted against qwerty at the US Navy. Recruits who had once performed at a measly 32 words a minute speeded up to a masterly 56. Yet the old qwerty standard still prevailed.
Messrs Liebowitz and Margolis have unearthed evidence to show that DSK's superiority is something of a fable. For one thing, as it turns out, the co-author of the landmark Navy study was Dvorak himself. And later studies failed to replicate the pro-Dvorak evidence.
Another supposed paradigm of path dependence is the famous Beta-VHS war. Sony's Beta, the argument runs, was a good product. But through sheer market aggression, RCA, the US distributors of VHS, managed to make VHS the US standard and so obtained an enduring monopoly.
But this, the professors note, is an incomplete account. While the technology of the two products was identical, Sony took a fateful step in crafting its cassettes. It believed portability would be the most attractive feature for the cassette. It made its product smaller - but with a playing time of only one hour, in contrast to VHS, which could handle full-length films. Filmgoers, as it turned out, became big video customers. VHS won.
In the Microsoft case, the company's advantage is Windows' superiority and not Microsoft's scheming. Messrs Liebowitz and Margolis criticise Judge Jackson's view that Microsoft did social damage by bundling its browser, Internet Explorer, in the Windows package. This may have hurt Netscape, a competitor, as the latter loudly claimed. But there is little evidence that it hurt the consumer, at least not in the long run.
The authors offer a telling example from an older industry giant, car manufacture. In the old days, US carmakers sold vehicles without the rustproofing necessary in bitter climates. Cautious buyers then took their new purchases to rustproofing specialists for treatment. Later, carmakers incorporated rustproofing into their own product.
This may have hurt America's big rustproofing company, Ziebart. It even disrupted car owner habits temporarily. But car owners in the long run were not unhappy to receive a road-ready product. Or, as the authors put it, "a rule that compels a look at consumer perception as though frozen in time will be harmful".
Given the failings of path dependence, why its prevalence as a way of looking at the world? Messrs Margolis and Liebowitz argue that path dependence survives because it is an argument that suits some of the biggest players in the global antitrust drama: competitors. Jack Welch of General Electric complained last week in a different context (the European Commission's review of GE's plan to merge with Honeywell), of regulators being more concerned with competitors than But while competitors have much to lose in battles against strong companies, it is not necessarily true that their defeat is also the consumer's. That is a valuable warning at a time when vigorous antitrust action has become the norm.

@_subject: Toy gun ban: This is pleasantly insane 
The British can own single and double barrel shotguns, but only if they're licensed and registered and they can only use birdshot.  If you take a look at British gun magazines, you'll see advertisements for really good replica firearms-  They're kind of expensive though.
An unintended consequence to all of this prohibitionist activity, and a not altogether harmful one IMHO, is that the average citizen is losing more and more respect for the government.  And the ultimate unintended consequence is the logical choice between violating the law by owning an illegal fake firearm or by violating the law owning a real one.  Most people will choose owning a real one-

Cass Sunstein is the Karl N. Llewellyn Distinguished Service Professor of Jurisprudence at the University of Chicago Law School and Department of Political Science. A former law clerk for Justice Thurgood Marshall, he has worked for the Office of Legal Counsel in the US Department of Justice.
His former works include: "Democracy and the Problem of Free Speech" (1993), which won the Goldsmith Prize from Harvard for the best book on free speech in that year. "After the Rights Revolution" (1990), "The Partial Constitution" (1993), "Free Markets and Social Justice" (1997), and "One Case at a Time: Judicial Minimalism on the Supreme Court" (1999).  His writings have appeared in the New York Times, and the New Republic.  He has also appeared on ABC's Nightline, the NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, NBC and CBS evening news and other In "Republic.Com" Cass Sunstein makes the point that in cyberspace individuals now have the ability to filter out everything they don't want to read or see and filter in only those whose opinions they agree with.  He calls this the "Daily Me", the ability to filter only the issues that concern you, read only the op-eds that only share your point of view.  In short he fears that the Internet will bring about a lack of diversity and will amplify extremism and hate groups (Whatever that means).  He writes of "cybercascades" that brings groups of people together who share similar viewpoints that in turn causes group polarization and radicalization.
Here's how he says it works: "Thus, for example, a group whose members lean against gun control will, in discussion, provide a wide range of arguments against gun control, and the arguments made for gun control will be both fewer and weaker.  The group's members, to the extent that they shift, will shift toward a more extreme position against gun control.  And the group as a whole, if a group decision is required, will move not to the median position, but to a more extreme point." (Chapter 3, pages 67 68)
He does his argument great damage by using as an example of a hate and extremist group the usual left wing target, The National Rifle Association (NRA) He trots out the usual suspects such as Skinheads and the KKK and fails to mention any of the other hate groups such as American supporters of Peru's shining path, environmental terrorists who spike logging areas, World Trade Organization protestors/rioters or other left wing extremists.  In Chapter three Sunstein speaks of the gun rights movement alongside the KKK, God Hates Fags, and other hate groups in what can only be considered as an attempt of guilt by  "FREE SPEECH IS NOT AN ABSOLUTE" his caps not mine.  In fact he mentions this line several times throughout the book.  He continues: "We can identify some flaws in the emerging view of the First Amendment by investigating the idea that the free speech guarantee is "an absolute", in the specific sense that government may not regulate speech at all.  This view plays a large role in public debate, and in some ways it is a salutary myth." He mentions the usual examples of child pornography, copyright and threats to assassinate the President as examples of the government restricting speech.   He creates what I consider a straw man argument by prefacing these remarks for his "Policies and Proposals" in Chapter eight.
He laments the fact that in the past the Public Broadcasting System (PBS) in a four station universe had a significant voice.  But with the advent of programming with hundreds of choices the justification for PBS is diluted.
As a partial solution he endorses Andrew Shapiro's suggestion from the book "The Control Revolution" that the government should support  "Public.Net would provide an icon, visible on your home computer.  You would be under no obligation to click on it; indeed in a free society perhaps you should be permitted to remove the icon if you really do not like it." He envisions Public.Net to include sections on the "environment, civil rights, gun control, foreign affairs, and so forth." (Chapter 8, page 181)
But what I find most troubling is his idea to require websites to maintain hyperlinks to those with differing viewpoints.  His example on page 188:
" We might easily imagine a situation in which textual references to organizations or institutions are hyperlinks, so that if, for example, a conservative magazine such as the "National Review" refers to the World Wildlife Fund or Environmental Defence, it also allows readers instant access to their sites."
Sunstein continues: "To the extent that sites do not do this, voluntary self regulation through cooperative agreements might do the job.  If these routes do not work, it would be worthwhile considering content-neutral regulation, designed to ensure more in the way of both links and hyperlinks."
Princeton sent me a free review copy of Republic.Com, which I'm glad they did as I would have been highly upset to have paid money for it. I can understand why Professor Sunstein makes the suggestions he does.  In my opinion it has less to do with wanting to expand free and open discourse and more to do with control.  Who gets to decide which links get to be included as "opposing viewpoints"?  I did note that many of Sunstein's examples involved a right wing organization being forced to carry left wing links.
The celebrated civil libertarian, John Stuart Mill, contended that enlightened judgment is possible only if one considers all facts and ideas, from whatever source, and tests one's own conclusions against opposing views. Therefore, all points of view -- even those that are "bad" or socially harmful -- should be represented in the "marketplace of ideas." And the Internet is an incredibly free and eclectic smorgasbord of ideas. And just as we have freedom to choose which sites we visit or what print magazines or books we read, it would be the end of freedom as we know it if the government forced us to read or watch what they want, even if it were only a link. Thanks, but no thanks to Republic.Com.

@_subject: Book Review: REPUBLIC.COM Reviewed By Matthew Gaylor 
An important distinction is that the filtering that Sunstein is
talking about is a what an individual or group does when they decide
what to view.  This is different than filtering software "censorware"
that the state uses to control who gets access to what information,
as used in the public schools and libraries.
What Sunstein is talking about is adding to the process state
mandated links and hyperlinks to sites with opposing viewpoints and
the creation of a permanently viewable link to a PBS equivalent
website (Public.Net).
So presumably in order to reduce radicalism and group polarization
which he considers a danger to democracy, a website run by such
organizations such as the National Rifle Association will be required
by law (If not done voluntarily) to add links to groups such as
Handgun Control, Inc.  Because in Sunstein's words 'FREE SPEECH IS
NOT AN ABSOLUTE".

@_subject: Gun Activists Have A Stake Against Filtering Software [Censorware] 
Both the American Civil Liberties Union and The American Library Association filed suit 3-20-2001 in Federal court to stop the Children's Internet Protection Act (CHIPA).  This is the act that forces libraries and schools to use filtering software (censorware). You can read both complaints here:
ACLU ALA Filtering software has been pushed as the solution to stopping children from viewing inappropriate materials, like pornography, on the Internet.  However, the software has numerous flaws, the most basic being that it doesn't stop all of the pornography.  More ominously, and more of a threat to our long term liberty is the fact that the software in many cases "blacklists" political and other material incorrectly.  Seth Finkelstein, who just won the Electronic Freedom Foundation's Pioneer Award, details a few gun related sites that are blacklisted.  If a school or library had the SmartFilter program installed, students would be blocked from viewing those sites.  As a point of information-   which is listed as "extreme" is the site run by the noted Police firearm's Instructor Massad Ayoob.  The site is His Lethal Force Institute, which trains qualified citizens and police in armed self defense techniques.  The other sites, are listed under the category of criminal skills.   is the site for Springfield Armory an American producer of fine firearms.  My recommendation is that everyone enter their favorite site's url at:   and see if their site or company is blocked.  Then I'd take whatever action, including the courts to have the incorrect designation removed.

This stuff is hardly new-  If you're going to engage in anti-governmental activity, even just speech, you're going to be a target of the investigatory police state.
On a routine basis I'm approached by what I consider either agents or agents provocateurs, both online and off, with an offer of some sort of illegal activity.  Usually they involve an offer of an illegal drug or an offer or a plea to help them convert a firearm to full auto. I politely inform them that those activities are illegal and I wouldn't be interested in them anyway (Which I'm not).
I've even outed a couple on occasion-  Once at a local civil rights meeting and another at a national machine gun shoot (Knob creek, KY).

@_subject: First Polygraphs and Then Torture? 
Note from Matthew Gaylor:  Today I read two more disturbing stories of America's slip into police statism.  The first is about a Illinois public school Nazi using a polygraph to ferret out the off school grounds activities of his students.  See:  . Dunlap, IL High School Superintendent Bill Collier said it was the right thing to do to sort the guilty from the innocent: "It may look bad, it may sound bad, but it's the fairest way."   -- One by one, the subjects were led into a room and hooked up to a polygraph machine.  The purpose: to determine whether the teen-agers violated Dunlap High School's code of conduct by attending a party where alcohol was consumed."
And I worry what might be the next step in America if polygraphs don't achieve the desired results. The New York Times reports  this chilling thought "In many quarters, the Newsweek columnist Jonathan Alter is considered a liberal. Yet there he was last week, raising this question: "In this autumn of anger," he wrote, "even a liberal can find his thoughts turning to . . . torture." He added that he was not necessarily advocating the use of "cattle prods or rubber hoses" on men detained in the investigation into the terrorist attacks. Only, "something to jump-start the stalled investigation of the greatest crime in American history." And the NYT continues:  "One week earlier, on CNN's "Crossfire," the conservative commentator Tucker Carlson said: "Torture is bad." But he added: "Keep in mind, some things are worse. And under certain circumstances, it may be the lesser of two evils. Because some evils are pretty evil."".
Now obviously giving children polygraphs and torturing terrorist suspects are very different, but what happens when the kids "crimes" are considered so heinous that stiffer measures are required? Considering the US government, public schools and other public institution's insane obsession with the war on drugs it is in my mind a hop, skip and a jump for them to come to the conclusion that torture, (like getting a teen drug pusher to revel his supplier) an acceptable technique.
Perhaps it's important to dust off your copy of The Bill of Rights and re-read the 5th amendment which explicitly states that:
"No person shall be nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law..."
See: I for one swore to uphold the US Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic and anyone who tortures suspects is someone I'd consider a traitor and enemy.

In refusing a federal prosecutor's recommendation of a jail sentence, U.S. District Judge Charles Shaw said Mr. Johnston's motivation did not appear to be devious and also ordered him to perform 200 hours of community service.

The Growing Power of Networks
The tragic events of September 11th made brutally clear that the fight for the future is not between the armies of leading states, nor are its weapons those of conventional armed forces. Rather, today's combatants come from terrorist groups like Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda, or drug smuggling cartels like those ravaging Colombia and Mexico. On the positive side are non-violent, civil-society activists fighting for the environment, democracy and human rights. What all have in common is that they operate in small, dispersed units that can deploy nimbly-anywhere, anytime. They know how to penetrate and disrupt, as well as elude and evade. They all feature network forms of organization, doctrine, strategy, and technology attuned to the information age. And, from al-Qaeda to the Intifadah to the drug war, they are proving very hard to beat...
Networks and Netwars: The Future of Terror, Crime, and Militancy, by John Arquilla and David F. Ronfeldt, Editors, (RAND, 2001) examines this new spectrum of conflict emerging in the wake of the information revolution. Netwar includes conflicts waged, on the one hand, by terrorists, criminals, gangs, and ethnic extremists; and by civil-society activists (such as cyber activists or WTO protestors) on the other. What distinguishes netwar is the networked organizational structure of its practitioners-with many groups actually being leaderless-and their quickness in coming together in swarming attacks.
Completed shortly before terrorists attacked New York and Washington, the volume includes an Afterword analyzing the Attack on America. The events of September 11, 2001, tragically reinforced Arquilla and Ronfeldt's conclusion that in order to confront this new type of conflict, it is crucial for governments, military, and law enforcement to begin networking themselves.
"Just as a half century ago, researchers at RAND sought to understand the profound changes in strategy brought about by nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles," says Brian Michael Jenkins, one of the world's foremost experts on terrorism and crime, "Arquilla and Ronfeldt explore the strategic implications of new information technologies in the latest installment of their seminal work... Networks and Netwars obliges us to think in new ways."
In Networks and Netwars, the editors and their colleagues examine the major instances of netwar that have occurred over the past several years-from Osama bin Laden's networked terrorists to the Battle of Seattle's social activists-and find, among other things, that netwars have generally been successful from the protagonists' perspective.
The authors also find that, despite their diversity, all networks built for waging netwar may be analyzed in terms of a common analytic framework. There are five critical levels of theory and practice: the technological, social, narrative, organizational, and doctrinal levels. A netwar actor must get all five right to be fully effective. The most potent netwarriors will not only be highly networked and have the capacity for mounting "swarming" attacks, they will also be held together by strong social ties, have secure communications technologies, and project a common "story" about why they are together and what they need to do. Like Osama Bin Laden's al-Qaeda, these are the most serious adversaries. But even those networks that are weak on some levels may pose stiff challenges to their nation-state adversaries.
With this in mind, it is necessary to go beyond simply diagnosing the nature of the networked nonstate opponent in a given conflict. "A particular challenge for the cumbersome American bureaucracy will be to encourage deep, all-channel networking among the military, law enforcement, and intelligence elements whose collaboration is crucial for achieving success," Arquilla and Ronfeldt explain in the Afterword. "U.S. agencies have been headed in this direction for years-in the areas of counter-narcotics as well as counterterrorism-but interagency rivalries and distrust have too often slowed progress."
Writers who focus on the technological aspects of netwar often miss the point. As the editors point out, "At its heart, Netwar is far more about organization and doctrine than it is about technology. The outcomes of current and future netwars are bound to confirm this."
Nathan Gardels, editor of New Perspectives Quarterly, and author of The Changing Global Order, says "Arquilla and Ronfeldt are a rare breed: strategic thinkers of the information age. In Networks and Netwars they grasp an emerging reality still lost on those preoccupied with the geostrategic balance of power: War in the future will be waged by leaderless networks that can come together quickly out of cyberspace to 'swarm' an opponent. Like few others, they recognize that the flipside of the celebrated global civil society born of the Internet is the 'uncivil society' of terrorists and criminals who will use the same means to spread havoc and "Rushing into an increasingly complex world, we need ways to probe the road ahead, to find the quicksand and pitfalls before falling in," says David Brin, author of The Postman, Earth, and The Transparent Society: Will Technology Force Us to Choose Between Privacy and Freedom? "Arquilla and Ronfeldt have taken on this hard task, searching for technological threats to a society that has grown reliant on data-based infrastructure... In this collection of cogent articles, by experts in the field of netwar, they clarify some of the dangers that await us-and reveal possible ways to avoid them. It's obviously an important and seminal work. I especially like their analysis of the key features that enable groups to be effective in this new arena of conflict."

    WASHINGTON (Variety) - The architects of the government's post-Sept.
    11 propaganda war may well want their MTV on the frontlines in the
    Arab world.
    Rushing to shift perceptions of the United States in the Islamic
    world, Washington and Hollywood are now brainstorming about how the

PGP creator defends right to encrypt emails against calls for a ban
By Mike Ingram
1 October 2001
[ Home page:  ]
Philip Zimmermann, the creator of Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)
encryption software, has issued a statement aimed at clarifying his
attitude towards encryption in the aftermath of the September 11
terrorist attacks in New York and Washington.
The statement, published on the technology site Slashdot, begins:
"The Friday September 21 Washington Post carried an article by Ariana
Cha that I feel misrepresents my views on the role of PGP encryption
software in the September 11th terrorist attacks."
Referring to a claim in the article that he was "overwhelmed with
feelings of guilt", Zimmermann says, "I never implied that in the
interview, and specifically went out of my way to emphasise to her
that was not the case, and made her repeat back to me this point so
that she would not get it wrong in the article. This
misrepresentation is serious, because it implies that under the
duress of terrorism I have changed my principles on the importance of
cryptography for protecting privacy and civil liberties in the
information age."
Zimmermann says that due to the political sensitivity of the issue,
he had the reporter read most of the article back to him by phone,
before she submitted it for publication. He insists, "the article had
no such statement or implication when she read it to me. The article
that appeared in the Post was significantly shorter than the
original, and had the above-mentioned crucial change in wording. I
can only speculate that her editors must have taken some
inappropriate liberties in abbreviating my feelings to such an
inaccurate soundbite."
He says he told Cha, "I felt bad about the possibility of terrorists
using PGP, but that I also felt that this was outweighed by the fact
that PGP was a tool for human rights around the world, which was my
original intent in developing it ten years ago."
Speculating on the reason for the misrepresentation in the Post
article, Zimmermann says, "It appears that this nuance of reasoning
was lost on someone at the Washington Post. I imagine this may be
caused by this newspaper's staff being stretched to their limits last
Zimmermann concludes his statement; "I have always enjoyed good
relations with the press over the past decade, especially with the
Washington Post. I'm sure they will get it right the next time."
Given the seriousness of the distortion that had appeared, this
reporter contacted Cha to ask if the Post would be issuing a
retraction of the article. Cha said in reply, "What I did not realise
was that some people would take the idea that he was feeling 'guilty'
would imply that he felt he did something wrong, despite the fact
that the story says he doesn't feel he made a mistake. That was not
my intention and I apologise for any misunderstanding. The way we
were thinking about 'guilt' was simply in terms of people feeling bad
or somehow responsible, even though there may be no reason for that.
She added, "I've talked to Mr. Zimmermann about this story several
times since it ran-in fact the day after the story was in the paper
he called me to thank me for it and tell me how much he liked it. He
did not mention any possible problem until this weekend when he
reached me at home." Cha said she accepted that Zimmermann, "needed
to put out a statement to clarify that he had not changed his views
that allowing the public to have strong encryption does more good
than harm."
Whatever the facts about Zimmermann's initial thoughts on the
article, his attributing the misrepresentations contained in the
article to editorial laxity is clearly not credible.
The September 21 Post article was published amidst a concerted
campaign by the Bush administration and a compliant media to channel
public opinion behind support for anti-democratic measures. The
tragic events of September 11 have been used to mount a wholesale
attack on civil liberties, one focus of which has been an
unprecedented intrusion into peoples' online privacy. Under these
conditions, it is hardly accidental that an interview commissioned
with Zimmermann is slanted to paint a picture of the man responsible
for the development of encryption consumed with grief and regret in
the aftermath of the terrorist attack. Such an article fits in with
the tenor of official propaganda insisting that so horrific is the
tragedy, only the most insensitive would object to a necessary
curtailing of civil liberties.
Zimmermann's public stance, as expressed in the Slashdot statement,
is entirely justified. Saying that the Post article "showed that I'm
not an ideologue when faced with a tragedy of this magnitude," he
"Did I re-examine my principles in the wake of this tragedy? Of
course I did. But the outcome of this re-examination was the same as
it was during the years of public debate, that strong cryptography
does more good for a democratic society than harm, even if it can be
used by terrorists. Read my lips: I have no regrets about developing
Rather than the response to a terrorist outrage, the present moves to
curb encryption and for closer monitoring of Internet use is the
outcome of a long held desire by the security services to be able to
monitor the movements and correspondence of every individual.
Sections of the US political elite have never reconciled themselves
to having been forced to abandon the so-called "escrow" plan,
requiring decoding keys used for private messages to be given to the
government. Neither have they accepted the December 1999 decision to
abandon controls on the use of "strong encryption."
Writing in the Online section of the Guardian newspaper in Britain,
Duncan Campbell exposes the claim that encryption played a key role
in regard to the terror attacks in the US. Campbell writes, "FBI
investigators had been able to locate hundreds of email
communications, sent 30 to 45 days before the attack... The messages,
in both English and Arabic, were sent within the US and
internationally... According to the FBI, the conspirators had not
used encryption or concealment methods. Once found, the emails could
be openly read. [Emphasis added]
Campbell cites Dr Brian Gladman, formerly responsible for electronic
security at the Ministry of Defence and NATO, who "believes that the
reason that the terrorists didn't use encrypted emails is that would
have 'stood out like a sore thumb' to NSA's surveillance network,
enabling them to focus on who they were."
For the real reason for the calls for increased surveillance and a
ban on encryption, one must look back to the period immediately prior
to the terrorist attack when tens of thousands of people were
protesting against the injustices of global capital in Seattle,
Melbourne, Quebec and Genoa. It was then that media commentators and
government spokesmen began talking about the role of the Internet in
allowing people to organise on a global scale and demanded an
effective means of preventing the free association of millions of
people desirous of social and political change.

@_subject: Anthrax! 
When asked about the current Anthrax scare, President Bush replied, "I don't  know what the big deal is all about.  I think it's perfectly safe to travel  by train."
Note from Matthew Gaylor:  I've heard that Israeli gas masks are now going for upwards of $150 with extra filters going for $30. Although they can be had cheaply enough on E-Bay.  That's a far cry from the case (12) I purchased years ago for something on the order of $5 per mask which included West German filters.  For those of you who aren't well prepared or aren't well heeled let me suggest The Junk Science, Do-It-Yourself -- Gas Mask below:

Wayne Hicks 10.03.01
(Note to my readers: I'll be following this with a Chem-Bio Protection system for small children, and a Do-it-yourself chem-bio shelter...  only here at Sierra Times!--WH)
Wayne has compiled a new e-book: Junk Science Survival that contains many instructions and much more information on how to apply some of these ideas to your own practical use!  Click below for more With the current state of affairs, and the repeated warnings by high-level Government Officials of possible, and even probable, Bio-Chemical Attacks on America, it seems to be time to apply the 'Real American Junk Science" philosophy to personal protection, and, based on the constant references in the news media to the demand for gas masks that can no longer be purchased, that item won first place in the list.
The strange looking girl in the photo above is my Daughter, DaniJo, and she is wearing a dual-filtered homemade gas mask that will, hopefully, afford her some protection in the event our small town becomes the target of a bio-chem attack.  The two-stage filter is made of plastic bottles containing various filter materials, connected together by medical-grade clear neoprene tubing, and mated to a standard oxygen nose-mouth face mask.  The eyepiece started out as an off-the-shelf eye-protector, and the housing is nothing more than a section of automotive inner-tube into which all of the relevant pieces have been secured with staples and rubber cement.
Air is drawn into the filter bottles through a length of 3/8 inch copper tubing which extends through the bottle's cap and all the way to the bottom.  The end is crimped so that air comes out of it in small streams.
The bottle contains rubbing alcohol, and air drawn through it rises through the alcohol in tiny bubbles, hopefully killing any germs along the way.  Also attached to the cap of the bottle, right beside the copper tubing, is one end of a length of our medical-grade tubing, and the air, which has bubbled up above the level of the alcohol, is now drawn through it to the second stage filter.
In this smaller filter bottle, the incoming tube also rests on the bottom, but it is covered with a large wadding of HEPA filter material removed from a HEPA vacuum cleaner bag.  It is then covered with four ounces of powdered activated charcoal, which is in turn sealed into place with a stuffing of more HEPA material.  The piece of tubing seen protruding from the side of the mouthpiece and wrapping around the mask is connected to the air exhaust valve, a small automotive one-way valve (called a PCV valve) that allows the air you exhale to vent from the filter system without building up positive pressure in the bottle.  When you inhale, the small amount of vacuum you apply to the filters and lines causes the valve to close, preventing any outside air from returning to the mask.  Since the exhaust-valve tubing is six inches long, any air in the tubing that might get sucked in before the ball can close is only air that you have already filtered and breathed out, and therefore presents no danger.  A second PCV valve is placed in the line from the filters to the mask, but reversed, so that it opens when you breathe in and closes when you breathe out.
Activated Charcoal absorbs many times its own weight in contaminants that pass through it, and while air flows freely through the charcoal powder and the HEPA material; particles as small as 0.3 microns do Powdered Activated Charcoal is well known as the world's most effective absorbent.  Activated Charcoal is like a magnetic sponge, that will adsorb any living or nonliving substance that has the opposite electrical charge.  It is made by cremating hardwood logs or coconut shells.  The resulting Charcoal is then steamed, producing microscopic tunnels.  Lastly, it is processed to produce sizes from blocks down to powder.  Different sizes of the resulting Activated Charcoal are used for different purposes.  When any gases or liquids pass by &/or through the Activated Charcoal, the substances as mentioned before will be attracted to it's surface.  Activated Charcoal can adsorb over 4,000 chemicals including drugs, poisons, toxins, and heavy metals, plus pathogens!  It is used in Air and Water filters all around the world.
HEPA filtration technology was developed by the U.S.  Atomic Energy Commission to remove airborne radioactive particles.  In order to be considered true HEPA filter it must be capable of removing 99.97% of particles as small as 0.3 microns.  Today HEPA filter is used in such places as hospitals and manufactures' clean rooms where clean air is absolutely vital.  ALL known bacteria will die when trapped in the HEPA filters, for after passing through the alcohol and Activated Charcoal elements, there is no moisture available to facilitate their growth, and they lose their own internal moisture rapidly.
This mask, as ridiculous as it looks, should be functional in protecting you against most bio-chemical attacks we may face, and here's why:
BIO ATTACKS: Because biological toxins are not volatile, as are chemical agents, and with rare exceptions, do not directly affect the skin, an aggressor would have to present toxins to target populations in the form of respirable aerosols, which allow contact with the more vulnerable inner surfaces of the lung.  This, fortunately, makes even our homemade gas mask potentially effective against such a threat, since it will absorb/trap particles as small as 0.3 microns.  Almost all biological attack threats are made up of aerosol particles between 0.5 and 5 microns in diameter.
CHEMICAL ATTACKS: During an attack with Chemical agents, the respiratory system must be protected against aerosols and gases in the air (at the same time, it's a good idea to protect the rest of the body against direct contact with chemical agents in the form of liquid or solid particles).
In addition, the respiratory system must be protected against evaporating gas.
The filter in a protective mask consists of two parts; an aerosol filter and a gas filter.  The aerosol filter is built up of a layer of fibers (HEPA).  The particles are removed when they collide with the fibers, to which they adhere.  If it is a volatile substance that adheres, it may subsequently evaporate from the aerosol filter. Consequently, it is important to design a filter whereby the gas filter component is located after the aerosol filter.
The gas filter component of the protective filter consists of Activated Charcoal, which absorbs over 400 varieties of chemical gases, including almost all known chem-warfare agents, and especially those which are most feasible to produce for use in large scale What all this tech-speak means is that this inexpensive alternative mask has a reasonable chance of keeping you alive for a period of time while you make your way to a shelter to await the "all-clear" and when I say "inexpensive", I mean it the whole thing was built for less than $30.00 in off-the-shelf parts and gathered junk, and only took about four hours of work!
The parts list runs as follows:
1 15 inch automotive inner-tube, scrounged free from a local tire store
1 pair of eye-protectors, $1.88 at Wal-Mart
1 Oxygen mask w/tubing, $3.00 from a local Medical Supplies store
1 tube "Shoe Goo" rubber cement, $2.97, Wal-Mart
1 4 oz.  Bottle of Activated Charcoal powder, $11.00, local drug store
2 small PCV valves, $2.49 each, Wal-Mart
1 package Hoover True HEPA vacuum cleaner Bags, $3.97, Wal-Mart
1 14-inch length 3/8 inch copper tubing, from an old air conditioner
1 bottle rubbing alcohol, $.88, Wal-Mart
1 2-liter pop bottle, from my trash can
1 20 oz Gatorade bottle, ditto Take a look:
Parts photo
All I did was cut out a fourteen-inch section of the inner-tube, and make cutouts for the eye-protectors and the nose/mouth mask, then push them through the holes and staple them in place.
The seams I coated with a liberal application of Shoe Goo, to ensure that they won't leak or come apart if you've ever used that stuff, you'll know what I mean!  And, by the way eye protectors have many little air holes around their housings be sure to plug them all with a layer of Shoe Goo!
Next, I removed the HEPA material from the vacuum cleaner bags in preparation for assembling and attaching the filters.  This is easy Just cut the top off the bag, and gently pull the HEPA liner out of the bag.  Be careful not to poke holes in it.
Assembling the filter bottles is the most difficult part, and even that isn't hard.  Drill two  3/8 inch holes in the cap, like so:
Make sure the copper tubing is clean, and push it through one of the holes in the cap so that it extends all the way to the bottom.  It's best if you can bend the end so that the opening cannot push against he bottom of the bottle, then use pliers to crimp the end slightly this will cause the air that comes through it to break up into small bubbles in the alcohol.  Next, cut the oxy-bottle-connector from the clear neoprene hose that came with your oxygen mask, and push the new end through the other hole in the cap, but only a short distance, say about an inch or two.  This end must always remain above the level of the alcohol in the bottle, and the bottle must always remain upright. Seal the tubes into the cap with lots of Shoe Goo!
The smaller bottle is for the dry part of the filter.  Again, drill two holes in the cap for this bottle, and then cut the neoprene line about twenty inches from where it enters the cap of the larger bottle, and push this end through one of the holes you just drilled. It should extend all the way to the bottom of the smaller bottle with a couple of inches to spare, so that you can lay it on the bottom of the bottle with cap still off.  Now, take about a ten-inch square of the HEPA material and fold it into fourths, then wrap this around the end of the tube you just put in the cap.  Secure it with a big glob of Shoe Goo and let it dry thoroughly.  Once it's dry, let it hang to the bottom of the bottle and pour in the Activated Charcoal.
Now take the rest of your HEPA material and pack it into the bottle. It doesn't matter if it gets pretty crumpled you want as much surface area exposed to the air coming through it as you can get! Once it's packed in, put the cap on and put a bead of Shoe Goo around the seam of the cap.
Take the end of the neoprene hose that is now left hanging from your mask, cut off a six-inch length and lay it aside, then push the remaining end through the last hole in the cap, only about an inch, and secure both hoses in place in their holes with more Goo!
Now, all that's left is to add the check valves, and hook it all up! This is a little tricky, so I'll go into heavy detail:
On each side of your oxygen mask, there are some holes arranged in about a quarter-inch circle drill or punch through one or two of them on one side, until you have a 3/8 inch hole, then use Shoe Goo to close up all of the others, on both sides.  Take the six-inch length of tubing you laid aside a few moments ago, and push it into the hole in the mask, then secure it with Shoe Goo, and use more Goo to glue it alongside the mask so that it curves upward around towards the ear.  Now, grab on of the PCV valves and look at the arrow on the side of it to see which way it allows air to flow.  You want to attach it to the hose so that it allows air to come I from the hose, but not go back in in other words, the arrow should point AWAY from the hose!  Seal the connection with Shoe Goo!
The final step is to connect the main filter line to the mask, and make sure that any holes in the connector (some have them) are sealed with Goo, and then cut the line about four inches below the mask, and get your other PCV valve.  This time, you want the arrow to point TOWARDS THE MASK this will allow air to come in from the filters, but will not let your exhales go back into the filter bottles. Instead, this will force your exhaled breath to exit the mask through the exhaust valve that we put alongside the mask itself.  Put the valve in place, then seal both ends of it to the hoses with Goo to make sure you don't have a leak.
Putting the mask on is a little tricky, and you need to practice until you can get it on and tightly in place in about four or five seconds.  Just pull the mask over your head, like a ski mask, but pull gently on the front of it and firmly on the back until it sits snugly in place and lines up on your eyes and mouth.  Adjust it for as much comfort as you can manage remember, it's part of an inner tube and may be a little tight.  This can be relieved partly by cutting away part of the back of the mask, making a hole that the back of your head can protrude into.  If it's still too tight, I'd suggest getting a bigger inner tube and start again I would never cut the back open and try to make straps work on it.
Well, that's about it You now have a gas mask that costs little, and while it may not be pretty, it will give you a lot better chance of staying alive than you'll have without one.
I'm making these for my whole family, and am working on a more portable design.  If you have any questions, feel free to email me directly at redneck at sierratimes.com.

@_subject: And Now Afghanistan by Murray N. Rothbard Circa 1980 
And Now Afghanistan
by Murray N. Rothbard
This article was originally published in the January-February 1980 issue of The Libertarian Forum.
These are grim times for those of us who yearn for a peaceful American foreign policy, for a foreign policy emulating the ideals of Thomas Paine, who exhorted America not to interfere with the affairs of other nations, and to serve instead as a beacon-light of liberty by her example. The lessons of the Vietnam intervention have been shuffled off with obscene haste, by masses and by intellectuals alike, by campus kids and by veterans of the antiwar movement of the 1960's. It started with Iran, with bloody calls for war, for punishment, for "nuking 'em till they glow."
But just as we have been whipping ourselves up to nuking Muslims and to declaring war against "fanatical" Islam per se, we are ready to turn on a dime and sing the praises of no-longer fanatical Muslims who are willing to fight Russian tanks with their bare hands: the heroic freedom fighters of Afghanistan. All of a sudden President Carter has gone bananas: declaring himself shocked and stunned by the Soviet incursion into Afghanistan, mobilizing the United Nations in stunned horror, levying embargoes (my how this peanut salesman loves embargoes!), and threatening the Olympics so dear to sports fans around the globe.
It's all very scary. There is the phony proclamation of personal betrayal Â Brezhnev not coming clean on the Hot Line Â all too reminiscent of the late unlamented King of Camelot before he almost got us into a nuclear holocaust over Cuba. There is the same macho insistence on regarding every foreign affairs crisis as a duel with six-shooters at high noon, and trying to prove that good ole Uncle Sam still has the fastest draw.
To set the record straight from the first: Yes, it is deplorable that Russia saw it fit to move troops into Afghanistan. It will, we can readily predict, be a disaster for the Soviets themselves, for tens of thousands of troops will be tied down, Vietnam-fashion, in a country where they are universally hated and reviled, and where they will be able to command only the cities and the main roads, and those in the daytime. But deplorable as the Soviet action is, it is neither surprising nor shocking: it is in line with Soviet, indeed with all Russian actions since the late 19th century Â an insistence on dominating countries on its borders. While unfortunate, this follows the line of Czarist imperialism: it is old-fashioned Great Power politics, and presages neither the "fall" of Southwest Asia nor an immediate armed strike upon our shores.
Indeed, the righteous horror of the U.S. and the U.N. at Soviet actions in Afghanistan takes on an ironic perspective when we consider the massive use of military force wielded not very long age by the United States against Cuba, Vietnam, Cambodia, and the Dominican Republic. Indeed, the ground for Soviet invasion: the backing of one side in another country's civil war, was precisely the groundwork or the massive and disastrous U.S. military intervention in Vietnam. In Vietnam, too, we intervened on the side of unpopular repressive regime in a civil war against a popular revolution: and now the Soviets are doing the exact same thing. So why the selective moral indignation wielded by: Carter, the U.N., the war hawk conservatives, the Social Democrats, the liberals, the media, etc.? Hypocrisy has become rife in America.
There are two crucial difference between America's and Russia's "Vietnam" in Afghanistan. One, that Russia will be slaughtering far fewer Afghans than we did Vietnamese. And two, that Afghanistan is, after all, on Russia's borders while we launched our intervention in Vietnam half the globe away from our shores. And Afghanistan, of course is even further away than Vietnam. The whole thing is ludicrous and absurd. Is Afghanistan now supposed to have been part of the "Free World"? Afghanistan has no resources, has no treaties with the U.S., no historic ties, there are none of the flimsy but popular excuses that we have used for over a century to throw our weight around across the earth. But we go, intervening anyway, loudly proclaiming that Russia's actions in Afghanistan are "unacceptable," and for which we are ready to scrap SALT, detente, and the feeble past attempts of the Carter administration to shuck off the Cold War and to establish come sort of modus vivendi with Russia. The conservatives, the Pentagon, the Social Democrats, the neo-conservatives, the Coalition for a Democratic Majority Â all the worst scoundrels in American life - have been yearning to smash detente, and to accelerate an already swollen arms budget and heat up the Cold War. And now Carter has done it Â to such an extent that such conservative organs as Human Events are even finding Carter foreign policy to be better in some respects than that of its hero The idiocy of the sudden wailing and hand-wringing over Afghanistan may be gauged by the fact that that land-locked and barren land had been a Russian client state since the late nineteenth century, when clashes of British and Russian (Czarist) imperialism came to draw the Afghan-Indian border where it is today. (An unfortunate situation, since northwest and western Pakistan is ethnically Pushtu Â the majority ethnic Baluchi: the same group that populates southern Afghanistan and southeastern Iran.) Ever since, the King of Afghanistan has always been a Russian tool, first Czarist then Soviet Â to the tune of no bleats of outrage from the United States.
Then, in 1973, the King was overthrown by a coup led by Prince Mohammed Daud. After a few years, Daud began to lead the Afghan government into the Western, pro-U.S. camp. More specifically, he came under the financial spell (i.e. the payroll) of the Shah of Iran, the very man much in the news of late. Feeling that they could not tolerate a pro- U.S. anti-Soviet regime on its borders, the Russians then moved to depose Daud and replace him with the Communist Nur Taraki, in April 1978. Ever since then, Afghanistan has been under the heel on one Communist ruler or another; yet nobody complained, and no American president threatened mayhem.
The reason for the latest Soviet invasions is simple but ironic in our world of corn-fed slogans. For the problem with Hafizullah Amin, the prime minister before the Soviet incursion, was that he was too Commie for the Russians. As a fanatical left Communist, Amin carried our a brutal program of nationalizing the peasantry and torturing opponents, a policy of collectivism and repression that fanned the flames of guerrilla war against him. Seeing Afghanistan about to slip under to the West once again, the Soviets felt impelled to go in to depose Amin and replace him with an Afghan Communist, Babrak Karmal, who is much more moderate a Communist and therefore a faithful follower of the Soviet line. There are undoubtedly countless conservatives and Social Democrats who still find it impossible to conceive of Soviet tools who are more moderate than other Communists, but it is high time they caught up with several decades of worldwide I deplore the Soviet invasion; I hope for victory of the Afghan masses: and I expect that eventually, as in Vietnam, the oppressed masses will triumph over the Soviet invaders and their puppet regime. The Afghans will win. Buy that is not reason whatever for other nations, including the United States, to leap into the fray. We must not die for Kabul!
The crocodile tears shed for the Afghans point up once again the disastrous concept of "collective security" which has provided the basis for the U.S. foreign policy since Woodrow Wilson and is the very heart and soul of the United Nations. Collective security means that any border skirmish anywhere, any territorial rectification, any troubles of any pipsqueak country, necessarily provides the sparkplug for a general holocaust, for a world war "against aggression". The world does not have one government, and so international war is not a "police action," despite the successful attempt of the warmonger Harry Truman to place that seemingly innocuous label on his military invasion of Korea.
U.S. hysteria over Afghanistan is the bitter fruit of the doctrine of collective security. If we are to avoid nuclear holocaust, if we are to prevent World War III, we must bury the doctrine of collective security once and for all, we must end the idea of the United States as God's appointed champion of justice throughout the world. We must pursue, in the immortal words of classical liberal Sydney Smith quoted in this issue, "apathy, selfishness, common sense, arithmetic." But we can't be apathetic in this pursuit, because time's a wastin.' American officials are ominously spreading the word that the Afghan crisis is the most threatening foreign affairs situation since the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, or even since World War II. No doubt: but only because the Carter administration and the war hawks have made it so.
Libertarians must mobilize to Stop the War, and to stop it now! We must stop the embargo (Carter's favorite foreign policy tactic), which is both criminal and counterproductive. Criminal because it aggresses against the rights of private property and free exchange. Criminal because it represses trade and thereby injures both the American public and the innocent civilian public of both Iran and Afghanistan. Counterproductive because, while hurting innocent civilians, embargoes do nothing to injure the power elites of either side. Embargoes will only unify the people of Iran and Afghanistan behind their regimes, which they will identify as defending them and their food supply against the aggressor Carter.
We must stop the war...and earn the gratitude of all Americans who cherish peace and freedom, and of future generations of Americans who will, one hopes, emerge from the bloody century-long miasma of nationalist chauvinism to see their way clear at long last for the truly American and the genuinely libertarian policy of nonintervention and peace.

@_subject: US Food Aid Propaganda 
Earlier I had sent notice of an article to my mailing list (Freematt's Alerts) titled "One object of information warfare -- or "infowar"..."  the original located at .  Then as a watched the news tonight I heard again what I've been hearing on various American media ad infinitum that the US Military had dropped 37,500 food packages along with the first wave of attacks on Afghanistan, on Sunday.  Realizing that there are several million refugees in the northern areas of Afghanistan, such a small number of food packages doesn't seem really that adequate.  But if you realize why the US Military would bother dropping such minuscule numbers of aid packages it only makes sense with a backdrop of PSYOPS.
"We call psychological operations (PSYOPS) the ultimate weapon," said retired Col. Jim Noll, who commanded the 13th Psychological Operations Battalion in the Persian Gulf War and helped develop tactics that led to the surrender of large numbers of Iraqi troops. For example, U.S. food distribution to Afghan refugees has "far-reaching psychological impact," Noll said."
My theory is that if you hear that the US is dropping food packages along with bombs it reinforces the propaganda that the US is doing this to "help" the Afghan people.  It doesn't matter from a psychological operations perspective if the aid is effective but rather it only matters if the target group thinks you're helping.  In this case the target audience being the Afghan refugees and the unwitting American media consumer.
I'm rather disappointed but certainly not surprised that the establishment media doesn't pick up on any of this.

@_subject: Censorware Article In November Playboy 
The November 2001 print issue of Playboy Magazine  has an article by Chip Rowe "Access Denied: coming to a library near you: censorware. (Forum page 55).  I just received my copy in the mail today.
Rowe cites an example from Bennett Haselton :
Begin Playboy quote: "Haselton created four web pages with titles such as "The Homosexual Agenda Information Center." He posted the anti-gay snippets without attribution.  He then reported the pages to various filtering companies.  Four companies blocked every page; two others blocked at least two.  Haselton shared the results with a reporter, who then phoned the companies to inform them of the ruse. Each refused to block the original sites. Today's lesson, kids:  It's not the content of the message but the clout of the messenger that will determine what you see." End Playboy quote.
Censorware refers to Internet filtering software that is federally mandated via The Children's Internet Protection Act.  The Act requires public schools and libraries to install the Orwellian software or risk losing federal funds.  In a recent show of moral courage the San Francisco City Library system refused to install the software and publicly stated that they'd forego the federal funds.

@_subject: 5 Reasons the Pro-freedom Movement Is in Trouble 
And succumb they do.
We now have these examples of alleged freedom advocates making the following non-freedom remarks.
1.) Reason Magazine Contributing Editor Cathy Young advocating banning encryption stating that: "Do I like the idea of people being able to encrypt electronic communications so that they are beyond surveillance? Frankly, I found it scary even before Sept. 11 - precisely because of the threat of terrorism.

@_subject: Reason Magazine And Foundation Support Encryption Rights 
I want to thank both Mike Alissi, (malissi at reason.com) Publisher of Reason Magazine and David Nott (davidn at reason.org) President, Reason Foundation who each sent me a copy of Jacob Sullum's October 16, 2001 essay "Fear of Prying" . Which I then sent to the subscribers of Freematt's Alerts (10,000+) and to several other mailing lists yesterday.
 "Boston Globe columnist Cathy Young, a colleague of mine at Reason magazine, has confessed that "the idea of people being able to encrypt electronic communications so that they are beyond surveillance" has always seemed "scary" to her, "precisely because of the threat of terrorism." This is like saying that computers or telephones or airplanes or box cutters are scary. Any technology can be used for good or ill. The question is whether the potential for evil justifies restrictions on legitimate uses."
And Sullum ends with: "Misuse of official records is not exactly unheard of in this country, and the problem would be magnified if every unsavory regime that has enlisted in the war on terrorism were to be trusted with the keys to its citizens' e-mail. For the dissidents Phil Zimmermann is rightly proud of helping, the whole point of encryption is to guard against official surveillance."
I was somewhat surprised and disturbed that Reason would publish Cathy Young's original article that appeared first in the Boston Globe, September 19, 2001 and then on Reason Online .  I think Freematt's Alerts subscriber Charles Platt , the distinguished science fiction author and senior writer at WIRED Magazine had the best "Bad enough that a contributing editor to Reason should indulge in the cliche-ridden handwringing of a statist apologist; far worse that these less-than-cerebral platitudes should be disseminated via an establishment publication, where Ms. Young is liable to be seen as a libertarian emissary.
To Cathy Young: All systems entail risk. As has just been demonstrated, a government-run system for terrorism-prevention does not eliminate risk. It only eliminates the superficial appearance of risk. This is far more dangerous than an honest approach in which risk is recognized and individuals are encouraged to deal with it instead of running to their elected representatives and asking to be "A free society is not a suicide pact"? No, it's a matter of principle, and of courage. I really think you should reconsider your political affiliations.

For better or worse Reason Magazine is viewed as a libertarian/freemarket publication. The magazine has in the last decade doubled it's circulation to over 60,000 which places it over conservative publications such as the Weekly Standard and nearly that of the liberal New Republic.  See Columbus Dispatch Metro Columnist Steve Stephens's   October 15, 2001 column "The Voice of 'Reason' Lives In Small Ohio Town" where he interviews Reason's editor Nick Gillespie  See: I'm optimistic that Reason won't lose it's way and veer away from their libertarian roots and I might add that Jacob Sullum's article is a step in the right and libertarian direction.

ID card idea attracts high-level support
Top executives, lawmakers back national identification card proposal
BY ELISE ACKERMAN AND PAUL ROGERS
Mercury News
Silicon Valley software mogul Larry Ellison's proposal to create a national ID card has gained substantial ground -- and the interest of top Bush administration officials -- in a signal that the controversial idea may be closer to reality than ever.
In an interview with the Mercury News on Tuesday night, Ellison, the chairman and CEO of Oracle, said he met with U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft and officials at the CIA and FBI in Washington, D.C., over the past week to discuss the idea. U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., has endorsed it, other tech executives have jumped on board and even some prominent civil libertarians have said the idea is worth pursuing.
``You don't give up much,'' Dershowitz said. ``Civil libertarians will come around.''

[Note from Matthew Gaylor:  It is an established procedure of a government to first hint at something that they are considering to gauge the reaction.  This has got to be one of the more disturbing items I've read over the course of the last couple of weeks.  The US constitution and bill of rights recognizes, not grants rights.  Any FBI agent who considers torturing a suspect should be fired and then prosecuted for conspiracy to violate civil rights.  Such an agent is also a traitor to the US constitution.  FBI agents when they take their oath pledge their allegiance to the Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic. Any law enforcement officer who tortures suspects or carts suspects off to be tortured in a foreign land certainly deserve to be considered Un-American and an enemy of the rule of law.]
Silence of 4 Terror Probe Suspects Poses Dilemma
By Walter Pincus
Washington Post Staff Writer
Sunday, October 21, 2001; Page A06
FBI and Justice Department investigators are increasingly frustrated by the silence of jailed suspected associates of Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda network, and some are beginning to that say that traditional civil liberties may have to be cast aside if they are to extract information about the Sept. 11 attacks and terrorist plans.
Said one experienced FBI agent involved in the investigation: "We are known for humanitarian treatment, so basically we are stuck. . . . Usually there is some incentive, some angle to play, what you can do for them. But it could get to that spot where we could go to pressure . . . where we won't have a choice, and we are probably getting Among the alternative strategies under discussion are using drugs or pressure tactics, such as those employed occasionally by Israeli interrogators, to extract information. Another idea is extraditing the suspects to allied countries where security services sometimes employ threats to family members or resort to torture.
Under U.S. law, interrogators in criminal cases can lie to suspects, but information obtained by physical pressure, inhumane treatment or torture cannot be used in a trial. In addition, the government interrogators who used such tactics could be sued by the victim or charged with battery by the government.

Several of my readers did the usual hand wringing worrying about getting the "F" word in their Dilbertized corporate business environments.

Nortel helping China to overhaul state surveillance architecture
By John Leyden
Posted: 22/10/2001 at 16:40 GMT
Human rights activists have launched an attack on Nortel Networks, accusing
it of contributing to human rights violations in China by helping the
country overhaul its ageing surveillance technologies.
The "Great Firewall of China", which controls content entering the country,
is failing, largely due to the increased volume of Internet traffic in
China, so the Chinese are looking to build a more sophisticated system
involving content filtration, and the monitoring of individual users.
That's one of the main conclusion in a report by The International Centre of
Human Rights & Democratic Development (ICHRDD) which states: "Old style
censorship is being replaced with a massive, ubiquitous architecture of
surveillance: the Golden Shield."
"Ultimately the aim is to integrate a gigantic online database with an
all-encompassing surveillance network - incorporating speech and face
recognition, closed-circuit television, smart cards, credit records, and
Internet surveillance technologies," it adds.
Many other Western firms are also involved in the development of China's
state security apparatus but Nortel, which like the human rights group, is
based in Canada, has come in for particular criticism in ICHRDD's report.
Among the Nortel projects singled out for criticism are:
Nortel's joint research with Tsinghua University on speech recognition
technology, for the purpose of automated surveillance of telephone
The Canadian firm's support for FBI plans to develop a common standard to
intercept telephone communications, known as CALEA, in conjunction with
technology transfer through its joint venture, Guangdong Nortel (GDNT)
The promotion of JungleMUX which allows video surveillance data to be
transported from remote cameras back to a centralized surveillance point at
the Chinese Ministry of Public Security (MPS)
The deployment of Nortel's "Personal Internet" suite in Shanghai, "greatly
enhancing the ability of Internet service providers to track the
communications of individual users"
A US$10 million project, involving Nortel, to build a citywide fibre-optic
broadband network in Shanghai (OPTera) enabling central authorities to
monitor subscribers at the "edge" of the network, principally through the
Shasta 5000 firewall.
Nortel's integration of face recognition and voice recognition technology in
collaboration with AcSys Biometrics, a subsidiary of Canadian firm NEXUS
Nortel is no stranger to controversy with its Personal Internet technology,
which was criticised on its announcement in February by consumers activists
and anti-junk mail campaigners, and has rejected ICHRDD criticism.
"Nortel Networks categorically rejects in the strongest possible terms the
notion that we are collaborating with any government to repress the human
rights or democracy of its citizens," a statement by Nortel said.
"Nortel Networks is a longstanding supplier of advanced telecommunications
products and technology in China where we have a broad range of customers.
Nortel Networks sells the same range of products and solutions in China as
we do elsewhere."
This response cut little ice with ICHRDD which believes Nortel's technology
will be used to clamp down on political dissent.
On September 28, four Chinese citizens were tried for subversion for
participating in an on-line pro democracy forum. The four are but the most
recent of several arrests in recent years for Internet-related crimes.
Pacific rim leaders are expected to announce an "anti-terrorism" pact at the
APEC summit this week which human rights advocates fear could be used to
excuse increased crackdowns on Internet privacy and human rights,
particularly in authoritarian states such as China. R

BILL WHITE: GUN GROUPS SEE STEADY BLEED INTO MILITIAS; DOMESTIC UNREST STILL GROWING IN UNITED STATES
When agents of America's US Marshals surrounded the Indiana Baptist Temple, accusing the church and its parishioners of violating US tax laws by refusing to pay social security taxes on non-clergical employees, they didn't charge in with guns blazing, as they did at Waco. Concern about bad publicity was there, but there was a more serious concern just under the surface - the Southern Indiana Regional Militia, a 250-man "unorganized" citizen's militia unit, had pledged to defend the church - and their threats were taken seriously.
"Steps have been taken and we are ready to respond if something does happen," Roger Stalcup, elected commander of the militia, told Indiana's Hoosier Times, "It's my opinion that if you've got people in that church and the U.S. marshals go in, anything can happen"
His statements were taken seriously, and his unit, which marches under the slogan "God Bless The Republic -- Death to the New World Order", was listed in a press release by the US Marshals as a major reason they chose to negotiate, rather than raid, the dissident religious group's headquarters. The Southern Indiana Regional Militia had been trained in small-unit tactics by former US military personnel, several of whom hold officer ranks in the citizen's group, and their ability to take on the US government in a fire fight could not only have been difficult for the federal police forces - it could have been disastrous.
The Southern Indiana Regional Militia is not an isolated phenomena - it is one of hundreds of similar units which have been growing in size and influence across the country since the announcement by George the First of his plans for a "New World Order" - a New World Order that many Americans believe is planning to destroy the US Constitution and enact dictatorial martial law in the name of the United Nations and the international corporate-socialism.
Origins In America's Gun Activist Community
There are three issues that motivate America's militia movement - support of gun rights, opposition to taxation, and opposition to the United Nations and the loss of America's sovereignty to global corporate rule - a system the militias see as socialism and anti-globalists label capitalism, and which is really a blend of the worst elements of the two. Among these issues, the most important, the one that seems most immediately threatening, and which has been the prime motivation for the existence of the militia movement, has been the possibility of nation-wide confiscation of firearms by the US Federal government. In America, the people know that the foundation of their liberty is their ability to use firearms to resist government police and military personnel, and it is widely believed that an attempt to confiscate their arms will be the first step in imposing a dictatorship on US citizens. Daily this has seemed more real, and thus there has been a steady bleed of activists out of mainstream groups like the National Rifle Association, and into more confrontational activist groups, like Gun Owners of America and the Tyranny Response Team, and eventually into militias and other armed non-governmental formations.
The NRA recently reported in the last election, with voters faced with the threat of anti-gun Al Gore
winning the presidency, that its membership surged from under three million to over four million. Some say that number is slowly edging closer to five. In a nation of 280 million people, nearly 1.5% of the population - one person out of sixty six - is a member of the country's largest gun lobby.
It is from these membership figures, and from the ability to mobilize large numbers of activists at the local level and bring them out to work polls and fill campaign offices for pro-gun politicians, that the NRA has always derived its power. While there is no doubt of the NRA's monetary power, it's opponents, often funded by billionaires like Andrew J. McKelvey, can usually match or exceed it in that arena. What the NRA has that anti-gun groups don't is the ability to bring out tens of thousands of Americans each election cycle to hand out literature, plant road signs, fold mailings, and engage in the community activism needed to fight anti-gun legislation. But it is in this arena that upstart groups have offered the most competition.
Gun Owners of America, headed by Larry Pratt, is a radically pro-gun organization that, in contrast to the NRA, has called for the elimination of all regulations on firearms purchases and ownership, including mandatory background checks, and which has taken a hard line against the United Nations. Pratt is a radical Constitutionalist and Christian who openly mixes his religious beliefs with his politics, and has been accused of sharing the stage with even more extreme leaders - including members of the Aryan Nations and the Ku Klux Klan (though he has not been accused of sharing their views). In 1996, that accusation forced Pratt out as an aid to the Buchanan campaign. In 1998, according to anti-gun researcher Kenneth Stern, Pratt's organization had 100,000 members. Now, similar anti-gun researchers estimate his group has grown to as many as 150,000 - 200,000 in size, and there is no question that the core of his strength is NRA grassroots activists who are leaving the NRA to be involved in more militant forms of activism.
Another group that has worked with Pratt's, and which forms an even more confrontational front of its own, is the Tyranny Response Team, a network of pro-gun "minute men", based on the minute men militias of the American Revolution, who go out to anti-gun events and to speeches by anti-gun politicians to confront and challenge the often skewed and distorted presentation of gun politics. The TRT, founded by Jewish gun store owner Bob Glass, has also gone beyond gun activism, holding regular 500-man protests against the Internal Revenue Service and the United Nations conference on small arms. While the TRT declined to give out membership information, it has branches in approximately 33 states, and most branches have 50 to 100 regular active members, meaning the group comprises at least 1500 regular activists nationwide - with an unknown number of less-active "supporting" members.
These groups, with their anti-globalist, anti-UN rhetoric and primitive class perspective - what Americans call "populism" - have begun to draw more radical elements of the NRA, such as Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre, to adopt similar rhetoric. In a recent issue of America's First Freedom - the NRA's fast-growing political magazine - LaPierre denounced global corporations, the wealthy, and ruling-class billionaires as being behind the plot to take away America's Second Amendment rights.
And while groups like Gun Owner's of America and the Tyranny Response Team are not militias per se, and often engage in very mainstream pandering in some of their rhetoric - the headquarters branch of the TRT in particular is ultra-Zionist, with its members sometimes appearing in public with yellow Stars of David reading "gun owner" in an attempt to link the current conflict between gun owners and the US government with the conflict between Jews and the German Third Reich - they serve as a bridge for gun owners who don't want to engage in the compromising, pro-Republican politics of the NRA, but who also reject the more extreme step of joining armed formations that openly challenge the power of the central government - groups like the Southern Indiana Regional Militia.
A Case Study In Radical Growth
Recently, in Montgomery County, Maryland, a relatively affluent suburb of Washington, DC, the local government attempted to ban gun shows - large, open exhibitions where guns and traded and sold on tables set up at the local fairgrounds. The result was a series of protests that destroyed the local NRA organization, led to the radicalization of its local head, and which left a definite imprint on local politics.
Augustus Alzona, an official in the Maryland Republican Party Central Committee, and the head of the County NRA's lobbying division at the time (NRA-ILA), was incensed at the decision of local officials to ban trading in guns. When he heard that a hearing was planned, he began organizing members to show up and protest the government's But Greg Costa, the NRA's official lobbyist in the State of Maryland, was equally incensed at Alzona's decision to hold protests. Costa views the NRA as a "moderate" and "non-confrontational" organization, and decided to make his legislative priority in the state not a pending local ban on gun shows, but stopping a noise ordinance that would have threatened a business investment he had made in a local shooting range. He ordered Alzona not to hold protests, and when Alzona refused, Costa fired him from his position in the NRA:
"I told him I didn't want them to protest and he wouldn't listen. I can't have people doing what I tell them not to do," Costa told a Pravda source.
The meeting collapsed in a raucous bout as pro-gun protestors threatened to shoot local Councilmembers if they passed the legislation. Local news media focused on the role of the Tyranny Response Team in the protests, though the truth was that most of the anger came from more radical elements not affiliated with the TRT group. For Alzona, it was a decisive moment. He took on a new role in the TRT Maryland group as its Volunteer Media Coordinator. Regarding the NRA, he told Pravda that Costa was a liar, and that his non-involvement in activism was a motivator for this defection:
"I've never spoken to [Costa] regarding the gun show bill and any of it's ramifications - never have, so far. I did try to reach him to discuss last February's hearing a week before the Âhearing, but, never did."
And Alzona isn't the only Maryland activist that sees the NRA and its lobby as ineffective, unreachable, and out of touch. John Latham, a gun activist who joined the NRA in the wake of the anti-gun hysteria that followed the Columbine shootings, decided to move over to the TRT as well. He has now declared he is running for the State Legislature as an Independent in Maryland's 16th legislative district, and told Pravda he left the NRA because he grew tired of the people and their perspective on what gun rights activism means:
"A man reaches a certain age he decides he wants to have a club," Latham told Pravda, "I don't consider that real activism Â that's a club, not a lobby."
The Real Activists
The Southern Poverty Law Center, a rather shady group of lawyers who make profit by suing organizations they label as "hateful", has been reporting that the number of "militia" groups active in the United States has been declining. Unfortunately, their research is badly skewed, as they count as a "militia" group anyone who opens a post office box and declares themselves a one-man "militia". Other figures, such as those circulated by the ADL, a Jewish organization which is opposed to the private ownership of firearms, estimates that while the number of groups may be shrinking, this is due to a consolidation of activists in a smaller number of larger organizations, and that as many as one million Americans may be sympathetic to, and peripherally involved in, militia activity.
This has been evidenced as well by the "radicalization" of mainstream groups that share common views with the militias, but until recently have not shared the militia's extreme image and tactics. Southern groups - groups that represent the values of America's White Southern minority - have been particularly radicalized in recent months with the continuation of a campaign by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, a pro-black group with origins in the communist movement of the turn of the last century, to destroy public monuments to the Southern Revolution and to the Southern Nation - known as "Dixie" -- which existed from 1861-1865 during the American Civil War. With a heritage based in revolt against the US federal government, and with an often deeply held belief in the independence of the states and the decentralization of government power, views that motivate Southern political thinking and ideology have definitely exerted their influence over militia thinkers.
One militia group based in Southern values that recently drew attention was the Militia of Georgia, an armed formation consisting of what researchers claim is 300 men who operate in at least 20 cells throughout the state, which ordered its members to mobilize in the wake of the September 11 bombings, and to be on guard against attempts by the government to use the bombings to create a New World Order. The local commander, Jimmy Wynn, in a message to his "When we cease to intervene in the affairs of every nation on earth, maybe some of these people will leave us alone. Â The WTC attack should be a WAKE UP CALL. I need each of you to become involved Â each of you needs to take preparedness seriously (we could go to war and it could reach our shores) Â The biggest thing we need is commitment: the commitment Â [to] prepare ourselves. THE TIME FOR ACTION IS NOW!!!"
The Potential For Separatism
America's Southerners aren't the only regional-ethnic groups seeking independence from the cosmopolitan internationalism of the nations' elite. Rural New Englanders have launched a "blood and soil" separatist movement of their own. Carolyn Chute's Second Maine Militia, a group that has mixed right-wing, left-wing, and green politics, as well as regional ethnic identity and national separatism, into a 500+ man armed formation based in Northern New England and Canada's eastern provinces, re-released a manifesto calling for people in New England and Canada to revolt and create a new nation - the New Atlantic Confederacy - independent of either government, should the impending war on terrorism cause the central government to lose the ability to maintain control in America's more remote rural areas. Her movement is explicitly pro-gun and anti-capitalist, and deals regularly with other "right-wing" militia organization active in the area. As Chute put it in a 2000 interview:
"Behind all those urban killings are people created by the Great Progressive Society. These people are not revolting against the Great Progressive Society. They are raw imitations of the Great Progressive Society. We are led to believe that the professional middle class are the winners, the working class are the losers. Â As I see it, class is about values, dependence and ways of communicating. The working class person values place, interdependence, cooperation, the tribe. Rural working class especially values land. Many of us would kill to keep our land, our home, which for thousands of years was not considered a crazy thing to do. Middle-class professionals are into "success" and they are a dependent people, happily dependent on the consumer system for everything. You call it independence. But if you lost your electricity, your service people, your access to stores, you'd see how independent you are! Working-class people have become dependent on these things, too, but working-class values resent this And Chute's movement is growing. She recently joked that she could probably maintain 1500 men under arms in the State of Maine alone "if she could keep up with the mail", and in a state of emergency, the number of women seeking protection under arms from ready formations would likely swell those ranks.
With groups like Chute's growing in every state of the Union, and the central government growing more and more willing to enact the kind of emergency measures that these groups are willing to fight against, the potential for wide-spread confrontation, and wide-spread revolt, particularly in the context of a break-down of government control caused by massive terrorist attacks, is growing.
Domestic Unrest and Anthrax
As the US has continued to see its media and government institutions attacked by anthrax-infected letters, a debate has raged over who is responsible. The Zionist-dominated US media has used the attacks as an excuse to implicate Iraq, though that effort seems to be motivated more by political gain than the actual facts. Though Iraq was found by UN weapons inspectors, during the 1990s, to have built two missile warheads with liquid anthrax payloads, the weapons were discounted by US experts as "ineffective", and Iraq is not known to have the ability to create the refined powder form of anthrax being used in the recent attacks. In fact, that ability exists in only two organizations in two countries - the US and Russian governments.
The US federal government also appears to believe in the domestic terror theory. Recently, the Center for Disease Control re-released a 1999 report authored by Jessica Stern of the Council of Foreign Relations, stating that most anthrax threats in the United States are linked to "far-right militia" organizations. Certainly, some of the recent scares, including the mailing of over 100 bogus threat letters to Planned Parenthood clinics, match the "far-right militia" pattern. But the possibility that the actual anthrax cases are linked to militia groups has been seized on by social democratic political lobbyists in an attempt to turn the US "war on terrorism" against dissident groups back at home. Australian terrorism "specialist" Clive Williams recently told the Times of India with utmost "I think the first instances of [the anthrax threats], the ones involving media, were more likely to have been caused by extremist militia in the US who have shown an interest in anthrax in the past and tried to acquire it. The subsequent instances were basically copy-cat episodes by mentally unbalanced people."
But no US militia group is known to posses the refined, military form of anthrax being used against the US media and government, and most US militia groups are more concerned with defending themselves against anthrax than spreading it in such a way that their families and communities might be affected. That leaves a third possibility - that the recent anthrax attacks have been committed by members of the US political establishment against other members of that establishment - a theory boosted by the revelation that two of the most recent victims - Tom Brokaw and Tom Daschle - are apparently good friends who's families know each other and often vacation together in the Dakotas.
In short, it appears more likely at this point that the recent string of anthrax threats in the US is the result of a deterioration of the internal political situation, than of an outside threat to the integrity of the nation. The question of whether it is related to the growing armed dissent against the central government is open however, as it may simply be a manifestation of political factions using instability as an excuse for assassination.
Conclusion: America's Militia Movement Is Not To Be Discounted
It is clear that the rural people of American - the mostly white population descended from the original European settlers of the nation - have become alienated from the cosmopolitan blend of urban white liberals and their train of ethnically defined special interests that have gained control of America's cities. One only has to look at a map of who voted for George Bush and who voted for Al Gore to see that a clear divide has occurred between the values of the country's elite and their lackeys, and the real working people of the nation.
America's white working class, so long reviled by the intellectuals and the clique that control the government, has been organizing itself into regional-ethnically based citizen militias that are prepared to fight to restore the values of their ancestor's revolution two hundred and twenty five years ago. For the first time in a century, more of America's white population lives in rural areas than in it's cities, and that demographic change is only one indicator of the larger, more widely spread divide.
Should the American nation fracture, whether due to a massive terrorist attack, the repressive domestic policies of its government, or a combination of both, it is clear that there are thousands, if not tens of thousands, of Americans who are already organized in paramilitary armed formation for the goal of seizing power and restoring the Constitutional Republic that they feel progressive liberalism has lost them.
Osama bin Laden has said that he feels that terrorist attacks can create enough instability in America that forces that already want to change the course of the government will see it weakened enough that an opportunity to act will emerge. With the growing divorce between an imperial government of usurpation and the nation's original Constitutional principles, bin Laden may not be far off.

Rape used as control in U.S. prisons
By NEVE GORDON
National Catholic Reporter, September 14, 2001
Many prisoners are targeted for sexual exploitation the minute they enter a
penal facility; their age, looks, sexual preference and other
characteristics mark them as candidates for maltreatment. In a new
groundbreaking report, Human Rights Watch documents the widespread
prisoner-on-prisoner rape in U.S. men's prisons. The rights group accuses
state authorities of not taking measures to prevent and punish rape and, in
many cases, for allowing this cruel form of abuse to persist.
One reads that in extreme incidents prisoners find themselves the "slaves"
of their rapists. Forced to satisfy another man's sexual appetites upon
demand, they may also be responsible for washing his clothes, massaging his
back, cooking his food and cleaning his cell. They are frequently "rented
out" for sex services, sold or even auctioned off to other inmates.
One prisoner from Arkansas wrote to Human Rights Watch: "I had no choice
but to submit to being Inmate B's prison wife. Out of fear for my life, I
submitted to [him]. In all reality, I was his slave, as the Officials of
the Arkansas Department of Corrections  did absolutely nothing."
"Rapes are unimaginably vicious and brutal," writes Joanne Mariner, deputy
director of the Americas division of Human Rights Watch, and author of "No
Escape: Male Rape in U.S. Prisons." Gang assaults are not uncommon, and
victims may be left beaten, bloody and even dead; they almost always suffer
from extreme psychological stress, including nightmares, deep depression,
shame and self-hatred, which may lead to suicide. There are also known
cases whereby the victim has contracted HIV.
No conclusive national data exists regarding the prevalence of this
phenomenon, but the most recent statistical survey, published in the Prison
Journal, revealed that 21 percent of inmates in seven Midwestern prisons
had experienced at least one episode of pressured or forced sex since being
incarcerated, and at least 7 percent had been raped in their facility.
Correctional authorities generally deny that rape is a serious problem. In
Human Rights Watch's survey of all 50 states, not one correctional
authority reported abuse rates even approaching those found by the rights
group. The authorities' reluctance to acknowledge the scale of the
violation is reflected not only in misleading official statistics, but also
in a glaringly inadequate response to incidents of rape.
When an inmate informs an officer he has been threatened with rape or,
worse, actually assaulted, his complaint is seldom investigated, and only
in rare instances is an inmate protected from further abuse. "U.S. state
prisons have failed to take even obvious, basic steps necessary to tackle
prison rape," Mariner writes. "This deliberate indifference has had tragic
In the report, one reads of M.R., a Texas inmate who was violently raped
and beaten several times over a period of several months by the same
prisoner. Fearful for his life, he reported the abuse to the prison
authorities, but received no protection. In fact one investigator dismissed
the complaint as a "lovers' quarrel." Finally one day the rapist showed up
in M.R.'s cell and attacked him. M.R. suffered a broken jaw, left
collarbone and finger, a dislocated left shoulder, lacerations to his scalp
and two major concussions that caused internal bleeding. The rapist was
never criminally prosecuted.
Why, one might ask, do prison authorities turn a blind eye to this horrific
phenomenon?  While Human Rights Watch does not directly deal with this
issue, it appears that the authorities' lack of response is premeditated.
Rape is an effective, albeit ruthless, mechanism of inmate control.
By allowing rape to go on, the "correctional" authorities ensure that
prisoner violence is contained within the cells. Frustrated prisoners are
permitted to release aggression on condition that they direct it against
other inmates, not the authorities. That the victims, who comprise as much
as 20 percent of 2 million inmates held in U.S. prisons and jail, live in
perpetual fear is also conducive to control. Divide and conquer is the name
of the game; the fact that it amounts to horrendous violations of human
rights does not really interest the prison authorities.

Gurion University, Israel.

[Note from Matthew Gaylor: I hope this doesn't turn out like the FBI's botched accusations that Richard Jewel was the Atlanta Olympics bomber, a charge that was completely false. With the absence of other suspects I suppose it's natural for the Feds to trot out the usual suspects.  Pravda had on October 18th all ready pointed out that the Center for Disease Control re-released a 1999 report authored by Jessica Stern of the Council of Foreign Relations, stating that most anthrax threats in the United States are linked to "far-right militia" organizations...

Of special interest in this article is the mentioning of Larry Wayne Harris, an Ohio microbiologist and former member of the Aryan Nations.  For a photo of Harris go to .  Being from central Ohio just like Harris I've seen him on a few occasions at local events.  I did make it a point not to engage him in conversation as I considered him a racist nut.  On one particular occasion at a gun and preparedness show in Columbus, Ohio sponsored by the Peoples Rights Organization, an Ohio gun and civil rights group, just before Y2K, Harris had a table and display selling his tapes and books on biological warfare. On his table he had a device for the spraying of biological agents such as Anthrax.  I examined the machine which looked like a stainless steel tube, like a coffee dispenser with a nozzle and valves.  The show had a prohibition in their rules about "weapons of mass destruction" and Harris was asked to leave.  As I remember a Franklin County Sheriff escorted Harris off the premises.  I don't think he was arrested.]
FBI and CIA Suspect Domestic Extremists
Officials Doubt Any Links to Bin Laden
By Bob Woodward and Dan Eggen
Washington Post Staff Writers
Saturday, October 27, 2001; Page A01
Top FBI and CIA officials believe that the anthrax attacks on
Washington, New York and Florida are likely the work of one or more
extremists in the United States who are probably not connected to Osama
bin Laden's al Qaeda terrorist organization, government officials said
Senior officials also are increasingly concerned that the bioterrorism
is diverting public attention from the larger threat posed by bin Laden
and his network, who are believed to be planning a second wave of
attacks against U.S. interests here or abroad that could come at any
time, officials said.
None of the 60 to 80 threat reports gathered daily by U.S. intelligence
agencies has connected the envelopes containing anthrax spores to al
Qaeda or other known organized terrorist groups, and the evidence
gleaned from the spore samples so far provides no solid link to a
foreign government or laboratory, several officials said.
"Everything seems to lean toward a domestic source," one senior official
said. "Nothing seems to fit with an overseas terrorist type operation."
The FBI and U.S. Postal Inspection Service are considering a wide range
of domestic possibilities, including associates of right-wing hate
groups and U.S. residents sympathetic to the causes of Islamic
extremists. But investigators have no clear suspects, and are not even
certain whether there are other undetected letters that contained the
deadly microbe.
But federal health officials said yesterday that a new case of pulmonary
anthrax in a man who worked at a State Department mail facility in
Northern Virginia has persuaded them that more than one contaminated
letter may have been sent to the Washington area. Health experts
previously believed that a single letter, sent to the office of Senate
Majority Leader Thomas A. Daschle (D-S.D.), likely caused all the
anthrax reports in the Washington area as it came in contact with other
pieces of mail in the system.
Now the "working hypothesis would be that this is not
cross-contamination," said Jeffrey Koplan, director of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. "There is not enough infectious material
from cross-contamination to do that."
However, ongoing searches of truckloads of undelivered mail to the U.S.
Capitol and other government buildings has turned up no other letters
laced with anthrax bacteria, leading FBI officials to assume that the
Daschle letter may still be the only local source. Two employees at the
U.S. Postal Service's Brentwood facility in Washington have died from
inhaling the lethal bacteria, and three other local postal workers have
contracted inhalational anthrax.
"This envelope, Daschle's envelope, is not watertight or airtight or
anything like that," one law enforcement official said. "It's porous. At
one or two microns, there's plenty of room for the spores to escape."
Although there is consensus at the FBI and CIA that al Qaeda associates
are planning more serious attacks, "nobody believes the anthrax scare we
are going through is" the next wave of terrorism, one senior official
said. "There is no intelligence on it and it does not fit any [al Qaeda]
No links between known foreign terrorist groups and the anthrax letters
have shown up on the daily Top Secret Threat Matrix, which includes the
latest raw intelligence on potential bombings, hijackings or other
terrorist attacks, one official said. Though "lots of things are
alarming" on the list, there is little agreement on how, when or where
an attack might be launched, officials said.
FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III warned earlier this week that
additional terror attacks are a "distinct possibility."
President Bush and other top U.S. officials have publicly voiced their
suspicion that bin Laden and al Qaeda -- accused of carrying out the
Sept. 11 suicide assaults on the World Trade Center and Pentagon -- may
be responsible for the anthrax mailings.
But Mueller, Attorney General John D. Ashcroft and other law enforcement
officials have said they have discovered no links between the mailings
and bin Laden. Authorities, speaking on condition of anonymity
yesterday, said they are increasingly doubtful that any connections will
be found.
One official said the only significant clue raising the possibility of
foreign terrorist involvement is the conclusion of FBI behavioral
scientists, who believe that whoever wrote the three letters delivered
to Daschle, NBC News and the New York Post did not learn English as a
first language.
But the writer could have lived in this country for some time, and the
other evidence gathered so far points away from a foreign source,
several officials said.
The anti-Israel message in the anthrax letters and bin Laden's
statements are echoed by U.S. extremist groups, said Rabbi Abraham
Cooper, associate director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los
One group, Aryan Action, praises the Sept. 11 attacks on its Web site
and declares: "Either you're fighting with the jews against al Qaeda, or
you support al Qaeda fighting against the jews."
Cooper said a meeting this year in Beirut was attended by neo-Nazis and
Islamic extremists united in their hatred of Jews. "Some extremists are
now globalized," he said.
White supremacists have been linked with anthrax in the past, but not in
relation to an attack.
Larry Wayne Harris, an Ohio microbiologist and former member of the
Aryan Nations, was convicted of wire fraud in 1997 after he obtained
three vials of bubonic plague germs through the mail. He was arrested
the next year near Las Vegas when the FBI acted on a tip that he was
carrying anthrax. But agents found harmless anthrax vaccine in the trunk
of his car.
Cooper and officials at the Southern Poverty Law Project, which monitors
U.S. hate groups, said they have seen no evidence of a domestic group
capable of launching a sophisticated anthrax attack.
One of the challenges that a would-be terrorist faces is learning how to
alter the anthrax so that it will float in the air and disperse widely.
The Washington Post reported this week that the spores in the Daschle
letter had been treated with a chemical additive using technology so
sophisticated that it almost certainly came from the United States, Iraq
or the former Soviet Union.
White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said yesterday, however, that
investigators believe a broad range of people are capable of the crime.
"The qualityanthrax sent to Senator Daschle's office could be produced
by a Ph.D. microbiologist and a sophisticated laboratory," he told
U.S. officials said the evidence so far does not point to either Russia
or Iraq. However, FBI checks of private and government laboratories in
the United States have not yet revealed any missing anthrax stockpiles,
disgruntled scientists or other suspicious circumstances, one top
official said.
Koplan, the CDC director, said he suspects more than one letter was
involved based on his understanding of how difficult it is to contract
inhalational anthrax. To cause the disease, 8,000 to 10,000 anthrax
spores must enter a person's lungs.
Although some officials said it is possible for that many spores to have
sloughed off the letter sent to Daschle onto another piece of mail,
Koplan said that is hard to imagine. "We all think that would be highly
unlikely to virtually impossible," he said.
Koplan speculated that there may have been multiple mailings and that
"there may be several places within the federal government that have
been deemed targets."
By contrast, the minuscule amounts of anthrax bacteria discovered at
Walter Reed Hospital and the CIA "may well represent
cross-contamination," Koplan said.
William C. Patrick, who is retired from the U.S. Army installation at
Fort Detrick, Md., said extensive studies show that once anthrax spores
hit the ground or other surfaces they stick, and are very hard to
There's a theoretical possibility that a few spores picked up by an
envelope might cause a skin anthrax infection, but a case of
inhalational anthrax "is highly unlikely," Patrick said.

Slevin and researcher Madonna Lebling contributed to this report.

    FBI Raids Muslim Businesses, Charity Organizations
    By Middle East News Online Reporter
    Posted Wednesday September 5, 2001 - 06:02:04 PM EDT
    DALLAS, Texas (MENO) - In another attempt to crack down on Muslims in
    the United States, the FBI hit again Wednesday, raiding a well-known
    Muslim Internet Service Provider company in Dallas, Texas.
    A Dallas area television reported that the raid involved nearly 50
    federal agents and was preceded by complete evacuation of the building
    that hosted the company, Infocom Corporation, among other businesses.
    No reasons were yet provided for the raid, but Muslim activists in the
    US fear that the US' backing of Israel is forcing it to become a
    "police state." The Muslim company hosts over 500 companies including
    leading Muslim organizations' web sites.
    Eyewitnesses say that agents from the State Department, US Customs and
    US Secret Services have also took part of the raid.
    Infocom is based in Richardson, Texas. Currently, the company's entire
    records are being confiscated, a process that might take a few days.
    The host company provides services for well-known organizations such
    as Council on American Islamic Relations, Islamic Society of North
    America and Holy Land Foundation.
    Muslim leaders in the US say that such actions are very alarming,
    especially as some of these organizations known for their charity
    works, not only for Palestine, but also worldwide.
    Bayan Elashi, the owner of Infocom, told reporters "We are just
    waiting for them (the FBI) to tell us what this is about."

    'Oman, Arab World Net Bandwidth Starved'
    By Conrad Prabhu
    Posted Wednesday September 5, 2001 - 10:18:38 AM EDT
    Muscat - Studies conducted by a strategic research company indicate
    that the Sultanate, along with a number of countries in the Arab
    world, will remain Internet bandwidth starved for several more years
    before improvements are forthcoming.
    According to the Arab Advisors Group (AAG), a Jordan-based specialised
    research and consulting company, the estimated 740,000-odd Internet
    subscribers in eight Arab countries share a grand total of Internet
    bandwidth of no more than 777 mbps.
    The combined Internet bandwidth of the Sultanate, Egypt, Saudi Arabia,
    Lebanon, Jordan, Morocco, Syria and the United Arab Emirates pales in
    comparison to what Internet users have in Europe and the United
    States.
    The combined bandwidth of these eight Arab markets is equal to what
    518 cable modem subscribers in the US have, the study concluded.
    The group's findings explain why the total Internet bandwidth in Oman
    and the Arab world is very low compared to that of other countries. It
    compares the Internet bandwidth among the Arab countries by using the
    group's 'Regional Bandwidth Index'.
    "In looking at what the AAG refers to as the 'Regional Bandwidth
    Index', we note that Internet users in Oman, Morocco, Egypt and Jordan
    have better bandwidth availability than those in the UAE, Saudi
    Arabia, Lebanon and Syria," said Jawad Abbassi, AAG's president.
    "Syria is the most bandwidth deprived of the countries with a score of
    0.19. Egypt topped the rankings with a score of 2.11." The AAG
    calculated the Regional Bandwidth Index by dividing each country's
    share of the total Internet bandwidth available by its share of the
    total subscribers' base.
    A score of more than one indicates a better than regional bandwidth
    per subscriber.
    The higher the index the better the bandwidth situation in the country
    compared to the region.
    The research group tied the intra-regional variance to the different
    dynamics of competition and liberalisation in the Arab countries.
    However, the overall low Internet bandwidth in all of the countries is
    a direct result of high costs, it pointed out.
    "Overall, Internet bandwidth costs in the region remain at much higher
    rates than those in the US or even Europe. Being small operators on
    the global scene, the ISPs/operators still lack any 'peering'
    arrangements with international backbone operators.
    As such they continue to pay the complete cost of full-circuit
    connections to the International Internet backbone operators.
    Add to this, the existence of cross subsidisation (local rates by
    international rates) by monopoly operators and the cost becomes even
    higher," Abbassi explained.
    "The statistics in this research note are based on extensive and
    painstaking primary research in all of the markets analysed," Abbassi
    noted.
    "AAG's team of analysts are based in the region and periodically
    travel to the countries they cover to meet with operators, regulators
    and vendors as well as to cement their relationship with AAG's
    in-country researchers.
    The strong emphasis on primary research stems from AAG's commitment to
    providing the most reliable research, analysis and forecasts of Arab
    communications and Internet markets," he added.
    With liberalisation and privatisation steps gathering momentum across
    the region (five of the markets already have plans to introduce
    competition in international service by 2005), the AAG predicts an
    easing of the situation as international bandwidth rates in these
    markets come down and ISPs expand their international bandwidth
    without extra costs.
    The AAG's team of analysts produce a subscription only Strategic
    Research Service that provides its clients with country by country
    projections and landscape analysis report covering the Internet,
    telecommunication, and technology industries in the Arab world.
    The service also includes trend reports that analyse major trends and
    outlines best practices and strategies in Internet, telecommunication,
    and technology in the Arab world, and periodic Research Notes
    analysing major events and developments.

...Mark Enoch, a lawyer hired by InfoCom after the raid began early
Wednesday, said the company had no links to terrorist groups and was
cooperating with the FBI, even helping agents navigate the computer
system. A search warrant requested by federal authorities was sealed by
U.S. Magistrate Judge Paul Stickney of Dallas, and agents outside
Infocom's offices declined to comment on the investigation.
InfoCom's Internet operations manager said agents cut off Internet service
to the company's 500 clients...
...Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic
Relations, linked the raid with U.S. opposition to international efforts
to criticize Israel's handling of the conflict with Palestinians.
"We suspect that all these attempts are to please the Israeli government
but not to protect the U.S. interests," Awad said. "Siding with Israel, a
racist country and state, I think does not do us any good."
Others viewed the raid broadly as the product of anti-Muslim bias.
"We have deep concerns that this once again is an attempt to rush to
judgment and to marginalize the American Muslim community simply because
... many of them are immigrants," said Mahdi Bray, political adviser to
the Muslim Public Affairs Council. "There is a pattern of bias that often
permeates all of these types of investigations."
Bailey declined to say why authorities targeted InfoCom, but she denied
any bias...
US MUSLIMS BLAST SEARCH OF MIDEAST INTERNET PROVIDER
Agence France-Presse, 9/07/2001
WASHINGTON, Sept 6 (AFP) - US Muslim leaders Thursday condemned a federal
search at the Texas offices of a Middle East Internet service provider,
calling it part of an "anti-Muslim witch hunt..."
...The search disrupted satellite television service in the United Arab
Emirates, according to reports from Dubai.
"American Muslims view yesterday's action as just one of a long list of
attempts by the pro-Israel lobby to intimidate and silence all those who
wish to see Palestinian Muslims and Christians free themselves of a brutal
apartheid-like occupation," a coalition of nearly a dozen Muslim groups
said in a statement. "We believe the genesis of this raid lies not in
Washington, but in Tel Aviv."
Among the groups voicing their discontent were the American Muslim
Council, American Muslims for Jerusalem and the Council on American-
Islamic Relations.
One of InfoCom's clients was the Qatar-based Al-Jazeera satellite
television network, the coalition said, a popular Arabic news outlet
frequently criticized by Israel for its reporting on the situation in the
Palestinian territories.
FBI DENIES BIAS AS US RAID SHUTS ARABIC WEB SITES
By Marcus Kabel, Reuters, 9/6/2001
DALLAS, Sept 6 (Reuters) - An 80-strong U.S. terrorism task force raided
the Texas-based host of Arabic Web sites, including that of the Arab
world's leading independent news channel, prompting charges on Thursday of
an "anti- Muslim witchhunt."
But the FBI, which took part in the raid on Wednesday at privately held
InfoCom Corp., in the Dallas suburb of Richardson, denied any anti-Arab
bias and said it was executing an unspecified federal search warrant...
...Several American Islamic groups condemned the search as "an anti-Muslim
witchhunt promoted by the pro-Israel lobby in America," according to a
statement from 10 organizations, including the Muslim Public Affairs
"We are deeply concerned that there is a pattern of stereotyping that
permeates all these types of investigations. There is a marginalization of
the American- Muslim population," Mahdi Bray of the Los Angeles-based
council said at a news conference outside the closed InfoCom office.
The FBI denied the raid was any kind of witchhunt.
"We were executing a search warrant as part of a criminal investigation.
It had nothing to do with anti-Islamic or anti-Palestinian or anti-Middle
East issues or anything like that," said special agent Lori Bailey,
spokeswoman for the Dallas FBI office...

BERKLEY DENIES MAKING COMMENTS ATTRIBUTED TO HER IN TEL AVIV NEWSPAPER
By TONY BATT, Las Vegas Review-Journal, 9/6/2001
WASHINGTON -- Rep. Shelley Berkley, D-Nev., described Israel as "our
country" during a meeting last week with a top Palestinian official and
said Palestinians could leave if they didn't like living under Israeli
control, according to a Tel Aviv newspaper columnist's account of a
meeting last week including the lawmaker and a top Palestinian official.
Berkley, who aides said has been receiving angry calls from constituents
after a Muslim group started circulating the report, on Wednesday, denied
making the comments. The column ran Tuesday in Ha'aretz, one of Israel's
leading newspapers. "I think there obviously was a mistake in the
translation," Berkley said. "There was no press at this meeting, and there
were several inaccuracies in the story..."
...Written by Akiva Eldar, the column in Ha'aretz described an exchange at
a meeting involving Berkley, other lawmakers, and Saeb Erekat, the chief
Palestinian negotiator in talks with Israel.
Eldar, a former Washington bureau chief for Ha'aretz, did not quote
sources for the information. He could not be reached Wednesday night.
"Berkley reprimanded Dr. Saeb Erekat for daring to use the term
`occupation,' reminding him that `this is our country' and `we' won the
war," Eldar wrote.
The column went on to say Berkley rejected Erekat's suggestion that he
should be given full civil rights by Israel. Berkley told him, the column
said, that if the Palestinians don't like the present situation, she is
not going to prevent them from leaving. The American Muslims for
Jerusalem, a small Washington lobby group critical of Israel, issued a
statement Tuesday criticizing Berkley for being "slavishly supportive of

SHIN BET STILL TORTURES PALESTINIANS
By Moshe Reinfeld, Ha'aretz, 9/6/2001
A report issued Thursday by the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel
says that the "defensive barrier" set up by the High Court of Justice two
years ago, against the torture of Palestinian suspects during
interrogation, is ineffective.
The organization argues that the court left practical gaps in its ruling,
which allow the Shin Bet security service to continue torturing prisoners

If Brian Dalton hopes to have his conviction for pandering obscenity thrown out, his new attorneys will have to prove he received poor legal counsel.
But the attorney who represented Dalton said that wasn't the case. "With all the facts that I know, I believe he was effectively represented,'' said Isabella Dixon, Dalton's original attorney.
As part of a plea agreement, Dalton, 22, pleaded guilty on July 3 to creating a journal in which he describes in detail the torture and sexual molestation of children. Dalton said the writings were fictional and were never distributed to anyone. Still, Franklin County Common Pleas Judge Nodine Miller convicted him of pandering obscenity involving a minor and sentenced him to seven years in The case shocked lawyers who specialize in First Amendment and obscenity law.

911 call preceded fiery Pennsylvania crash
Frantic passenger relates hijacking via cell phone
By Julia Keller and Jon Yates, Tribune staff reporters. Tribune news services contributed to this report
September 12, 2001
LAMBERTSVILLE, Pa. -- The call came at 9:58 a.m., a frantic message from a passenger aboard United Airlines Flight 93, on a wayward path over western Pennsylvania.
Dan Stevens, spokesman for the Westmoreland County Department of Public Safety, said a dispatcher received a 911 call from a man aboard the flight just before 10 a.m. EDT. The man, calling from a cell phone, told the dispatcher the plane had been hijacked.
"He repeated that phrase several times," Stevens said.
The man told dispatchers the plane "was going down," said Glenn Cramer, a dispatching supervisor at the call center. "He said he heard some sort of explosion and saw white smoke coming from the plane." Officials said the call cut off after about one minute.

BUSH'S FAUSTIAN DEAL WITH THE TALIBAN
Enslave your girls and women, harbor anti-U.S.  terrorists, destroy every vestige of civilization in your homeland, and the Bush administration will embrace you.  All that matters is that you line up as an ally in the drug war, the only international cause that this nation still takes seriously.
That's the message sent with the recent gift of $43 million to the Taliban rulers of Afghanistan, the most virulent anti-American violators of human rights in the world today.  The gift, announced last Thursday by Secretary of State Colin Powell, in addition to other recent aid, makes the U.S.  the main sponsor of the Taliban and rewards that "rogue regime" for declaring that opium growing is against the will of God.  So, too, by the Taliban's estimation, are most human activities, but it's the ban on drugs that catches this administration's attention.
Never mind that Osama bin Laden still operates the leading anti-American terror operation from his base in Afghanistan, from which, among other crimes, he launched two bloody attacks on American embassies in Africa in 1998.
Sadly, the Bush administration is cozying up to the Taliban regime at a time when the United Nations, at U.S.  insistence, imposes sanctions on Afghanistan because the Kabul government will not turn over Bin Laden.
The war on drugs has become our own fanatics' obsession and easily trumps all other concerns.  How else could we come to reward the Taliban, who has subjected the female half of the Afghan population to a continual reign of terror in a country once considered enlightened in its treatment of women.
At no point in modern history have women and girls been more systematically abused than in Afghanistan where, in the name of madness masquerading as Islam, the government in Kabul obliterates their fundamental human rights.  Women may not appear in public without being covered from head to toe with the oppressive shroud called the burkha , and they may not leave the house without being accompanied by a male family member.  They've not been permitted to attend school or be treated by male doctors, yet women have been banned from practicing medicine or any profession for that matter.
The lot of males is better if they blindly accept the laws of an extreme religious theocracy that prescribes strict rules governing all behavior, from a ban on shaving to what crops may be grown.  It is this last power that has captured the enthusiasm of the Bush White The Taliban fanatics, economically and diplomatically isolated, are at the breaking point, and so, in return for a pittance of legitimacy and cash from the Bush administration, they have been willing to appear to reverse themselves on the growing of opium.  That a totalitarian country can effectively crack down on its farmers is not surprising.  But it is grotesque for a U.S.  official, James P.  Callahan, director of the State Department's Asian anti-drug program, to describe the Taliban's special methods in the language of representative democracy: "The Taliban used a system of consensus-building," Callahan said after a visit with the Taliban, adding that the Taliban justified the ban on drugs "in very religious Of course, Callahan also reported, those who didn't obey the theocratic edict would be sent to prison.
In a country where those who break minor rules are simply beaten on the spot by religious police and others are stoned to death, it's understandable that the government's "religious" argument might be compelling.  Even if it means, as Callahan concedes, that most of the farmers who grew the poppies will now confront starvation.  That's because the Afghan economy has been ruined by the religious extremism of the Taliban, making the attraction of opium as a previously tolerated quick cash crop overwhelming.
For that reason, the opium ban will not last unless the U.S.  is willing to pour far larger amounts of money into underwriting the Afghan economy.
As the Drug Enforcement Administration's Steven Casteel admitted, "The bad side of the ban is that it's bringing their country--or certain regions of their country--to economic ruin." Nor did he hold out much hope for Afghan farmers growing other crops such as wheat, which require a vast infrastructure to supply water and fertilizer that no longer exists in that devastated country.  There's little doubt that the Taliban will turn once again to the easily taxed cash crop of opium in order to stay in power.
The Taliban may suddenly be the dream regime of our own war drug war zealots, but in the end this alliance will prove a costly failure.  Our long sad history of signing up dictators in the war on drugs demonstrates the futility of building a foreign policy on a domestic obsession.

@_subject: The Assault on Civilization by David Kelley 
The Assault on Civilization
by David Kelley, Executive Director
Most of us still find it impossible to grasp the destruction of the World Trade Center. It was real, we saw it, but it does not belong in any reality we can understand. We saw the airliners, full of people who might have been us, streak incomprehensibly toward the walls of steel and glass. We saw them morph into fireballs that trapped thousands of people, working at their desks on a routine morning, in an inferno that killed most of them. We saw the shimmering towers collapse, and the towers of volcanic smoke that rose to take their place in the New York skyline. The images have been imprinted on our minds, never to be forgotten, but they will not compute.
In that sense, the terrorists succeeded. They have rocked our sense of reality. They have confronted us with a horror we could not have imagined, and may never assimilate. But they have also revealed, for everyone to see, the real nature of their cause. The assault is being described as an act of war against America, and it is. But unlike the Pentagon, the World Trade Center had no military significance. Unlike the White House--which the fourth, unsuccessful plane had apparently targeted--it had no political significance for U.S. policy in the Middle East, or anywhere else. The attack on the twin towers cannot be seen as an effort, even a twisted effort, to redress the grievances of people who feel dispossessed. It was an act of sheer destruction, for the sake of destruction.
With rare unity, Americans have grasped that this was an assault on their values, and it was. The buildings were obviously chosen as symbolic targets. But the values are not uniquely American, or even uniquely Western. They are the values of civilized life anywhere. This was an assault on civilization as such.
When it was built in 1973, the World Trade Center was an engineering marvel, innovative in structural design and in the construction techniques invented to erect the towers on that site. Though larger, taller structures have since been erected, New Yorkers were justly proud of these towering symbols of technical, industrial audacity.
The buildings' tenants were a cross-section of a productive economy: insurance companies, engineers, banks and investment houses, law firms, educators, employment agencies, construction companies, travel agencies. The tenants included great names in American finance--Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Lehman Brothers. They included Empire Health Choice, which provides health insurance and medical services to millions of people in New York State. Dow Jones, one of the world's great publishing companies, had offices in the South Tower. The top floors of the North Tower housed the transmitting facilities for the major broadcasters in New York. Fuji Bank of Japan occupied three floors, and scores of businesses from other countries had offices in the building. Befitting its name and the intent of the builders, it was a crossroads of international commerce, a symbol not only of wealth but of trade as the civilized mode of human interaction.
"World trade means world peace," said the chief architect, Minoru Yamasaki. "The World Trade Center buildings in New York had a bigger purpose than just to provide room for tenants. The World Trade Center is a living symbol of man's dedication to world peace. The World Trade Center should, because of its importance, become a representation of man's belief in humanity, his need for individual dignity, his beliefs in the cooperation of men, and through cooperation, his ability to find greatness."
These towers became landmark of the skyline of New York City, which has always been a powerful symbol in its own right, a beacon of freedom and opportunity. From the Statue of Liberty to the Empire State Building, that skyline was forged from the melting pot where the best in man is refined from the accidents of race and nationality. In Ayn Rand's Fountainhead, the famous novel of a New York architect, one character says that when he sees the city, "I feel that if a war came to threaten this, I would like to throw myself into space, over the city, and protect these buildings with my body." Many of us wished we could have done just that when we saw the towers finally crumple and collapse.
Technology, achievement, trade, law, peace, freedom-these were the values under attack. They are not American values but human values, the values of civilized life.
Though it is not yet known for certain which particular terrorist band committed the atrocity, we have every reason to believe they sprang from a fanatical subculture of Islamic fundamentalism. But our enemy is not Islam, which created one of the world's great civilizations, nor is it the Arab or Iranian or Afghani peoples. Our enemy is the nihilism of this subculture.
The terrorist leaders claim to speak for Palestinians. But the grievances of that people, even if legitimate, cannot explain the motivation for this act, much less justify it. The terrorists claim to speak for the victims of Western imperialism. But any literal imperialism is a thing of the past, long since redressed by the wealth that Europe and America have showered on these countries. It is clearly not the military or political power but the cultural power of the West that they resent.
What makes them denounce America as the great Satan is nothing as superficial as Coca-Cola or blue jeans. It is our secular culture of freedom, reason, and the pursuit of happiness. They hate our individualism; what they want is an authoritarian society where thought and behavior are controlled by true believers. They hate capitalism as a system of trade, production, innovation, and progress; what they want is a return to a primitive mode of existence from which these "materialist" aspirations have been banished. They hate the political system of individual rights, the rule of law, and secular government; what they want is a tribal society ruled by The nihilist subculture is a worldwide phenomenon. We see it in the Japanese Aum Shinrikyo sect that released poison gas in the Tokyo subways. We see it in the hate-filled eyes of Christian killers in Northern Ireland. We see it in the eco-terrorists who spike trees and blow up electrical transmission towers. We see it in less murderous forms in the anti-globalization protesters who want to stifle international trade. We see it in the theorists of primitivism from Jean-Jacques Rousseau to the Unabomber.
Civilization has always attracted parasites who wanted to steal wealth from those who produce it. But this phenomenon is different. The nihilists do not seek wealth for themselves. They want to destroy the wealth of others. They do not seek freedom from domination. They want to abolish freedom. They do not seek a place at the table of world commerce. They want to smash the table. They do not seek a better life. They glory in death. They represent the worst form of envy, the most vicious form of human evil. They hate us not for our sins but for our virtues, and they will not be appeased.
The United States and its allies must cease the policy of trying to counter terrorism by negotiation. Negotiation is an exercise of reason that civilized people use to resolve their differences. We are not dealing with civilized people. We must cease the policy of excusing their violence by their poverty and trying to buy them off with subsidies. We are not dealing with people who seek such gain. We must declare war on the terrorists and use whatever force it takes to render them incapable of posing any further threat. In the early 1800s, Thomas Jefferson sent the United States navy to rid the Barbary coast of pirates. We urge President Bush and the Congress to undertake a similar campaign not merely against the perpetrators of this outrage but against every nest of terrorists who have declared themselves, by the death and destruction they have wrought, to be enemies of mankind.
In doing so, we will be acting in our own self-defense, with the moral authority of those who have been attacked. But we should understand and declare to the world that we are acting to preserve a world order on which civilized values depend, and civilized peoples everywhere must join in this cause.

Freedom flees in terror from Sept. 11 disaster
By Paul McMasters First Amendment Ombudsman
First Amendment Center
Last Tuesday's terrors were so calamitous that they threaten to shake us loose from our constitutional mooring. A civil liberties catastrophe looms as citizens surrender to fear, fury and frustration and as lawmakers throw money and shards of the Bill of Rights at the specter of terrorism.
Some of our elected leaders predict a gloomy future for freedom.
"We're in a new world where we have to rebalance freedom and security," said House Democratic Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo. "We're not going to have all the openness and freedom we have Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., repeated the warning: "When you're in this type of conflict, when you're at war, civil liberties are treated differently."
Even staunch First Amendment advocates, haunted by the suffering and devastation in New York City, near Washington, D.C., and the Pennsylvania countryside, are tempted to temporize in the face of insistent calls to suspend or re-examine our commitment to civil The First Amendment fallout commenced within hours of the airplanes crashing into their targets. Tuesday afternoon, FBI agents fanned out to persuade Internet firms and service providers to hook up e-mail sniffing software to monitor private citizens' e-mail. While the desire to marshal all resources in such circumstances is understandable, there are serious consequences for private speech and public discourse when ordinary citizens fear that law enforcement officials with broad powers to investigate and detain are listening Expressive activity was curtailed in a variety of places. A high school official reprimanded a student who distributed a flier asking her classmates to pray. Officials at the Baltimore Museum of Art took down a Christopher Wool painting containing the word "Terrorist" (later, they promised to provide "new interpretation" for the painting when it is reinstalled). New York police and members of the National Guard confiscated film from journalists and tourists.
If only that were the worst of it.
Government officials and policymakers immediately called for measures that would chill public discourse, disrupt reporting by the press, and interrupt the flow of information to the public. They want an expansion of law enforcement powers to spy on telephone and Internet traffic, to restrict the use of Internet encryption products that thwart online monitoring of private email, to slow down and divert funds from the declassification of secrets, and to force public libraries to reveal information about patrons' use of their computers.
In Congress, prospects brightened for several troubling measures, including:
*	The Cyber Security Information Act, which among other things would blow a gaping hole in the Freedom of Information Act.
*	Anti-leaks legislation, dubbed the "official secrets acts" by those who are deeply concerned about its impact on speech and the press and the flow of critical information to the public.
*	The Flag Desecration Act, which would for the first time in the history of our nation amend the First Amendment to prohibit burning the flag as a form of political dissent.
To compound the threat, there are disturbing examples of private or self-imposed restrictions on expression. Web pages shut down or removed content, a radio network circulated a list of songs that would be problematic to play, an employer confiscated American flags from the desks of workers, and a wire service withheld news footage after Palestinian threats against a photographer.
It would be foolish to dismiss such events - public or private - as mere nibbling at the edges of our rights. In fact, each nibble diminishes our commitment to freedom and the principles that distinguish our way of life from all others.
In such an atmosphere, voices of dissent grow silent, probing questions by the press are viewed as unpatriotic and subversive, and whistleblowers inside government with vital information are quieted. In such an atmosphere, propaganda, rumor and paranoia fester and infect. In such an atmosphere, citizens are denied their place as full partners in their own governance.
By suspending some of our most precious principles, the risk becomes not just terrorists whose hearts have grown rancid with hate but also a citizenry whose hearts are filled with fear.
There are things we can and should be doing rather than joining the stampede to ditch our rights. As columnist Thomas Friedman put it: "We have to fight the terrorists as if there were no rules and preserve our open society as if there were no terrorists."
First, we must remember that we've gone down this road too many times before. We have suspended freedom of speech, press and assembly during wartime and other crises, to the point of sending prominent Americans to jail for long terms for uttering unpatriotic words. And always we've looked back in wonderment that we could have been so stupid, that we could have so easily cast aside our democratic We must demand of ourselves that a distinction is made - in public discourse as well as public policy - between what is merely inconvenient and what strikes at the heart of our most important We must demand of those proposing a degradation of our freedom that they provide an immediate and convincing argument that such an approach represents a real solution rather than a false hope.
Finally, before we begin to contemplate forfeiture of any of our essential liberties, we must thoroughly examine the lapses in public policy and operations that have become so cruelly evident in the wake of the disaster. Lapses in intelligence collection and analysis; in basic security measures at airports; in granting and monitoring of visas; in national, state and local emergency preparedness.
As much as we wish to be safe forever from the horrors of last week, we simply cannot protect freedom by forsaking freedom. As much as we want relief from this time of national duress, we simply cannot make ourselves more secure by making fundamental freedoms less secure.
The words of Samuel Adams, in a different time and context, present a challenge to our natural impulse to sacrifice freedom in the face of "Contemplate the mangled bodies of your countrymen, and then say, What should be the reward of such sacrifices?  If ye love wealth better than liberty, the tranquillity of servitude than the animating contest of freedom - go from us in peace. Crouch down and lick the hands which feed you. May your chains sit lightly upon you."
What an affront to the courage and heroism shown by those who gave their lives in rescue efforts or in forcing hijackers into a crash if we give in easily to fear or panic.
Fire from the skies and hatred from afar last Tuesday caused human carnage and suffering at an unthinkable level. They dealt terrifying blows to our financial institutions, our transportation and communications systems, our political and military nerve centers, and to a nation's sense of self and security.
Do we really want to add constitutional freedoms to that sorrowful list of casualties?

@_subject: Why the Palestinian Candy Story Was Believed 
There are reasons why alleged urban legends such as when CNN filmed the Palestinian candy celebration are believed.  It is in part due to an innate distrust of government and the fact that governments do engage in propaganda and disinformation campaigns.
"The Pentagon is a master at deception campaigns aimed at the news media. They constantly broadcast disinformation to television and radio audiences in Haiti, Serbia, Colombia, Mexico and elsewhere."
Most of us should remember the mini-flap (Which should have been much larger) when it was revealed that the US Army's psychological operations units intern at CNN. Now "Ha'aretz Daily" reports that an Israel Defence Force (IDF) film crew was dispatched to film candy being handed out in East Jerusalem and the Palestinian newspaper "Jerusalem Times" reports that the candy shop owner was paid for the candy by the IDF.

URGENT ACTION ALERT
The Administration's proposed Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001 is currently scheduled for mark-up by the House Judiciary Committee tomorrow (Tuesday) morning. It is critical that consideration of the legislation be delayed until the Committee holds comprehensive public hearings on the serious civil liberties issues the proposal implicates. The Committee is currently planning to proceed to mark-up after testimony only from the Attorney General and a short, informal "briefing" on the issues that raise constitutional concerns.
There is an urgent need for concerned organizations and individuals to contact members of the Judiciary Committee and urge them to delay consideration of the bill until its impact on civil liberties can be carefully and fully considered. These contacts need to be made IMMEDIATELY to delay tomorrow morning's scheduled mark-up.
Committee members and their contact information follows. It would be particularly useful if constituents of these members express their concern. Please forward this alert to your members, affiliated organizations and appropriate mailing lists.

@_subject: Clueless CATO Institute Thinks Ban On Knives A Good Thing 
[Note from Matthew Gaylor:  I usually highly recommend the CATO Institute as they nearly always take a principled pro-freedom stand on the issues.  Below is an exception.  CATO's Ivan Eland writes that "The ban against sharp metal objects (i.e., knives) aboard aircraft is a good one."  Making airline passengers an even more inviting target is not something that strikes me as smart idea let alone a pro-freedom market liberal ideal.  In the early 1960s American airline passengers could carry firearms on their carry on luggage-  A period that didn't see hijackings I might add.  It was only after government regulation via the FAA that effectively emasculated personal defense from both the pilots and passengers have we seen in flight terrorism.  If you're disappointed with CATO's position I suggest you contact CATO Executive VP David Boaz . Or write or call the Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W.

Don't Give Bin Laden Total Victory
by Ivan Eland , Director of Defense Policy Studies, Cato Institute
The monstrous and despicable attacks on the Pentagon and World Trade Center have given the terrorists two victories. We must prevent them from gaining a third.
The first victory-achieving mass casualties-was obtained with a nefarious, but deft, lightning strike that converted ordinary airliners into explosive, building-busting weapons. The second victory was achieved by inducing first panic, and then fear, into the American public through the publicity that the attacks received.
The first two victories were wrought by the terrorists' own efforts but whether they achieve a third victory is up to us. As bad as the mass casualties and widespread fear were, the worst and most long lasting scar from the attacks could be an alteration of the American way of life. Politically, the United States is the freest nation on earth. Our citizens enjoy freedoms unmatched anywhere in the world. If the attacks result in the curtailment of American civil liberties in the name of increased security, the terrorists' triumph will be Added airport security might be needed but the measures chosen should not be applied in a broad and draconian way to show that the U.S. government is "doing something" about the problem of terrorism. The government's tendency to overdo its response to crises is well known. For example, after the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center and the 1995 poison gas attack on the Tokyo subway, Congress passed the draconian Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. That law reduced civil liberties but did not institute measures that would have prevented those types of attacks.
Instead, any new airport security provisions adopted should specifically help address the threat. The ban against sharp metal objects (i.e., knives) aboard aircraft is a good one. The bans on electronic ticketing and curbside check-in seem to be an example of government measures that have only a tangential relationship to the problem of hijacking. The apparent justification for them is that terrorists might opt for other means of attack if hijacking with knives is denied to them. If that is the case, then maybe we should prohibit all air travel.
Although the public's desire for increased security is understandable, security measures should not be so onerous that air travel becomes a nightmare. If the speed limit on the highways were reduced to 5 miles per hour, many lives could be saved but our society would grind to a halt (or at least slow down dramatically). In anything we do in life, we take some risk. Despite the heat of the moment, terrorist attacks and airplane hijackings are still rare Terrorism is like water flowing in a stream-it follows the path of least resistance. Like moving water, which flows around rocks, logs and other obstacles, terrorists will change their tactics to move around defenses and attack the weakest point. Terrorism, perpetrated by loose associations of small shadowy groups, also is hard for intelligence agencies to detect and is therefore difficult to stop. We can only institute so many security measures to prevent terrorism before the burden to an open society is too great.
Therefore, in the long-term, when the dust settles after the predictable and justifiable military response to this heinous act, we should ask ourselves why the United States is the target of almost 50 percent of the world's terrorism. That percentage is high for a nation that is half a world away from most of the world's conflicts, has no ongoing civil war, and has no hostile neighbors. We should also ask ourselves whether increased security or intelligence gathering would trash the civil liberties that make the United States unique and great. That would be the greatest victory for Bin Laden and probably the most long lasting tragedy for America.

Hello Aimee,
Who might the "we" include?  You and who else?
But to comment on your statement-  Have you ever viewed the after action notes of FBI HRT member Lon Horiuchi after he shot Vicki Weaver in the head while holding her infant daughter?  Horiuchi's diagram of what he saw clearly shows the outline of Vicki in the doorway to their cabin- (Made on a hotel notepad.)  A clear indication that Horiuchi did in fact target her and not hit her by accident as alleged in the official report.
I'd have respect for the Bureau if they upheld the constitution and the rule of law over the blue wall of silence.

Matthew Gaylor responds:
I would hope it's not a debatable point when your Director of Defense Policy, Ivan Eland thinks victim disarmament is a good idea when he states "The ban against sharp metal objects (i.e., knives) aboard aircraft is a good one." [See I think libertarian economist Walter Williams has the correct, and  "The new air safety regulations are consistent with today's anti-crime strategies: If people commit crimes with guns, call for gun control; if people commit crimes with knives, call for knife control. Current law prohibits pilots from having guns to protect their crew and passengers.  That law should be changed. Instead of meekly going along with the FAA's new, costly, oppressive and stupid safety regulations, Americans should rebel against them. Are we so timid and feminized that we'll accept anything politicians do in the name of safety?"  See: So my question to Mr. Eland is why is he willing to accept FAA regulations over freedom? And isn't Ben Franklin still right when he  "They that can give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety."?

Civil liberties may take a hit
By Cathy Young
It's such a cliche to say that the reality hasn't sunk in yet -- but it's true. Despite all the devastating images, part of me still doesn't belive that the Twin Towers are no more, or that the station where I have so often arrived in downtown New York by local train station from New Jersey lies under a pile of rubble, or that thousands are dead in what is unquestionably the most devastating terrorist act ever committed, not just on American soil but anywhere.
And there are so many other cliches that come so easily right now and that are true: above all, that the world will never be the same.
As always, there are those who would exploit an unthinkable tragedy for their own hateful agendas. On the left, a few commentators, such as filmmaker-activist Michael Moore, have found this a good time to decry the sins of American capitalism and US foreign policy for which we are supposedly being punished by the world's dispossessed.
On the right, a few so-called men of God have found this a good time to decry the "wickedness" of gays and lesbians, feminists, the American Civil Liberties Union, and abortion providers, for which we are supposedly being punished by the Lord.
So far, however, the divisive rhetoric isn't finding many takers.
Americans are united in mourning and just anger. The way we have come together to help and support those affected by the horror of last week's bombings shows us at our best as a people.
And yet moments of national unity and resolve are always of concern to those of us who are concerned with the expanding powers of the state and the fate of individual rights and civil liberties.
Historically, individual freedom has not fared well in wartime, understandably so. And whatever military action we may take at the moment, one of the fears is that a war against terrorism may be, at least for the foreseeable future, a permanent war.
There are libertarians who say that it doesn't have to be that way. They argue that, if our government only withdrew from meddling in regions where we have no real interest, stop playing global policeman, and limited itself to providing for a national defense against foreign attack, we wouldn't be a terrorist target.
Alas, this is a myopic position. Aside from whether a 21st century democracy can survive in isolation, the sort of people who carried out this monstrous act hate us for much more than our foreign policy.
Note that their targets included not only the Pentagon and (apparently) Capitol Hill or the White House, but the World Trade Center - a symbol and a bastion of international capitalism, not of US military power.
Philosopher David Kelley, director of the Objectivist Center, makes this point eloquently in an essay on the center's Web site, "The Assault on Civilization." (which strikes a chord whether or not one shares the center's philosophy, based on the writings of Ayn Rand).
The fanatics behind the bombings, Kelley writes, hate the West's cultural power most - "our secular culture of freedom, reason, and the pursuit of happiness. They hate our individualism; what they want is an authoritarian society where thought and behavior are controlled by true believers."
We could stay out of world affairs and they would still hate and fear our influence.
What to do, then?
To sacrifice our freedoms to fear of terrorism would destroy the very way of life that we seek to protect and hand the terrorists a victory. On the other hand, a free society is not a suicide pact.
We will undoubtedly have to put up with tougher security at airports. The movements of foreign visitors will be scrutinized more closely. Perhaps most alarming to many civil libertarians, it's likely that the government will expand its ability to monitor electronic mail, which has been a controversial issue for some time.
Do I like the idea of the government intercepting e-mail? No. But, as long as there's judicial oversight and due process, that's no different from its longstanding power to intercept regular mail.
Do I like the idea of people being able to encrypt electronic communications so that they are beyond surveillance? Frankly, I found it scary even before Sept. 11 - precisely because of the threat of It is said that there are no atheists in foxholes; perhaps there are no true libertarians in times of terrorist attacks.
Even in the Declaration of Independence, the right to liberty is preceded by the right to life.

NO FRIENDS OF LIBERTY IN FOXHOLES?
by David M. Brown     Exclusive to TLE
Are there no libertarians in foxholes?
In a recent op-ed first published by the _Boston Globe_, reprinted by
_Reason Magazine_ at their web site, then reprinted by the electronic
newsletter _Freematt's Alerts_, Cathy Young opines that maybe
individual rights and human freedom aren't so sacrosanct after all --
not if we're in a foxhole and the terrorists are lunging at us with
box-cutters in their teeth.
Just as there are no atheists in foxholes, perhaps there are no
libertarians in them either, Young suggests.
I don't know. It's a theory. Perhaps no foxhole residents possess any
convictions of any kind. Perhaps the human spirit simply shrivels and
withers in foxholes. But I doubt it.
"Do I like the idea of people being able to encrypt electronic
communications so that they are beyond surveillance?" Cathy Young
asks. "Frankly, I found it scary even before September 11 --
precisely because of the threat of terrorism. It is said that there
are no atheists in foxholes; perhaps there are no true libertarians
in times of terrorist attacks. Even in the Declaration of
Independence, the right to liberty is preceded by the right to life."
How sad to read these comments. Is Cathy Young implying that if I
don't want the government to be able to open my mail at will, I'm an
enabler of terrorism?
I agree that the right to liberty is _grounded in_ the right to life.
It pertains to what my right to life entails in a social context --
what others owe to me and what I owe to them, if we are to be able to
function in support of our own individual lives and also get along
with each other. It's true that the right to liberty doesn't mean the
right to do any old which thing I choose to do. I don't have the
right to threaten my neighbors or do arbitrary violence to them. If I
act as a criminal, I do forfeit the right to walk as a free person.
And if government has (true) probable cause to suspect me of
criminality, yes they should have every reasonable power to
But how can I be asked to forfeit my right to protect my own personal
privacy in advance of _any_ reasonable evidence of _any_
rights-violating wrongdoing or planning of same?
When I am in a public context like an airport, whose managers might
reasonably request the ability to search my suitcase as a condition
of my doing business with them, I can understand submitting to an
inspection ... though I might not agree with it and might even think
it's offensive and obtuse, depending on how long they linger over the
But Cathy Young is talking about another case altogether. She is
suggesting that I must give up a particular right to act on my own
behalf when the private enterprise involved is entirely willing to
sell (or give me) the particular good which Young says I have no
right to possess: robust encryption software.
Why? Because I "might" act as a criminal? Or does encrypting my
private stuff per se constitute a violation of somebody's rights?
And if so, whose?
Young also says that it would be okay to check out my electronic mail
as long as there is "due process." Well, that sounds okay, though
with the FBI's notorious Carnivore technology, my private email may
well be read in full if the Carnivore system gleans one or two
suspect words. No warrant required.
Surely Cathy Young is aware that the government does not always have
good reasons for the things it does. At least if the feds and the
cops must apply for a warrant, they has to give a court _some_ before
prying into my personal things. But from what I gather, Carnivore is
premised on the notion of _not_ having to bother about warrants
before inspecting the email of particular individuals. It supposedly
can gulp and scan every single piece of email that goes through a
particular electronic hub, without any differentiation between one
individual and another. That is the point. Are "probable cause"
warrants going to be granted to scan the email of all the millions of
email users -- and if so, doesn't that destroy the notions of
probable cause and warrants?
I don't suppose such considerations even apply to making it illegal
for people to effectively encrypt their email and documents so as to
head Carnivore off at the pass, as well as other possible info
thieves. That's some other kind of violation of constitutional
protections and basic rights.
Young's rationale for violating my rights seems to be the same
rationale offered by the critics of bearing arms and other methods of
protecting yourself. Gun control is also a violation of liberty in
the name of safety. Of course, far from ensuring safety, gun control
deprives people of a means to provide for their personal safety.
Don't believe me? Well, think about this. Suppose a thug comes at you
and if you had a gun you could overpower him and protect yourself,
but because of gun control/victim disarmament laws you don't have a
gun and you can't overpower him and protect yourself. Well, it is
true enough that in that moment you also don't have any ability to
commit a terrorist act or shoot little babies with that gun you don't
have. But you also can't use that nonexistent gun to protect
yourself. See, you don't _have_ the gun. You can't use things you
don't have. I should think this would be obvious.
In the same way, Young would deprive persons of a means to provide
for their personal privacy and the safety and security of their
private information on which, who knows, their very lives may
sometimes well depend. Certainly robust encryption might be very
useful to dissidents living under totalitarian rule, for example.
If guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns. If robust crypto
is outlawed, only outlaws will have robust crypto. Or does Ms. Young
believe that terrorists be obliging enough to use only the
government-approved crypto technology, the one with the backdoor
entrance for the FBI?
What's next? A camera in every street corner and living room? Should
the government know where everybody is at any moment, and every
single thing everybody is doing in any given moment? Well, why not?
Rights, as Young implies, must give way when "safety" is at risk. And
surely if there is a computer-searchable video bank of everything
everybody does, it will be hard for terrorists or anybody to cover
their tracks. As Winston Smith discovered. (Never mind whether such
universal surveillance and cataloging and retrieval of the video
clips is technologically feasible right at this moment. If it's not
technologically feasible today, it will be technologically feasible
tomorrow. And you would only need to sign up about 50 percent of the
American populace for the job of keeping an eye on themselves and the
other 50 percent.)
Let's say that lives are indeed "saved" as a result of universal
surveillance. Since per Cathy Young, life per se -- survival per se,
whether or not in freedom -- in itself trumps liberty as a value,
there can be no objection that the trade-off is too excessive at any
particular point in the process of giving up our liberty. If Young
disagrees, then I would ask her what _is_ the criterion or principle
that she would employ to determine when the trade-off becomes
unjustified? (Too Draconian? Big Brother run rampant? Oh come on.
Hello. Safety. Remember? Safety.)
Any such principle would also have to show that the rights which I
thought I had and which are now to be traded away -- i.e., including
the right to take peaceful action in self-protection of my personal
privacy -- were never truly my rights at all. A right -- a
fundamental right, based on my nature as a human being and the basic
requirements of my survival in society -- is something that can't be
traded away merely because of some abuse that somebody _else_ (i.e.,
somebody who is not me) might commit.
Young also seems to assume that if a criminal or terrorist is
deprived of one convenient method of developing their plans in
privacy, he will not then resort to some other method: for example,
code words and regular mail. Or getting together in a hotel room.
(Oops. Forgot. All the hotel rooms will have video camcorders
installed. So they meet in the woods.)
Then there is the fact that there are many effective things that can
and should be done to anticipate and combat the terrorists that do
not at all entail violating the rights and constricting the peaceful
action of innocent persons. After all, until September 11, we didn't
even take the threat all that seriously. It was only a few embassies
here and there being wrecked.
The free society is not a "suicide pact," Young writes. I agree.
Well, if the passengers and crew aboard all those planes that met
disaster on September 11 had a) not been tutored to cooperate with
terrorists and b) been armed at the time of the hijacking (at the
very least, if the crew had been armed), might not all that death
have been prevented?
This is war, but it is a war on two fronts. With the exception of a
few deranged left-wingers, Americans are united against the
terrorists. We agree that we want to live, and that it is wrong to
kill us. Let us also be united in defense of our individual right to
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness as practiced in daily
life here at home. Maybe it is too much to demand that all Americans
be consistent in this cause, given all the engrained confusions of
modern politics. But it should not be too much to demand such
allegiance at least from those who up until September 10 professed to
be informed advocates of the principles of the Declaration, and gave
some evidence of actually being that.
When you're in a foxhole, it is nice to have compatriots in adjacent
foxholes. It is nice to soldiers who stick with you through thick and
thin. So let there be no more defections to the other side. Cathy
Young, come back. You are managing to get published in the _Boston
Globe_. That's great. Fight for liberty there.
Defense of life requires defense of liberty, including the right to
bear arms and robust crypto. Now is a time not to surrender our
rights, but to recognize and fight for them.

Euro bank notes to embed RFID chips by 2005
By Junko Yoshida, EE Times
Dec 19, 2001 (5:14 AM)
URL: SAN MATEO, Calif. - The European Central Bank is working with technology partners on a hush-hush project to embed radio frequency identification tags into the very fibers of euro bank notes by 2005, EE Times has learned. Intended to foil counterfeiters, the project is developing as Europe prepares for a massive changeover to the euro, and would create an instant mass market for RFID chips, which have long sought profitable application.
The banking community and chip suppliers say the integration of an RFID antenna and chip on a bank note is technically possible, but no bank notes in the world today employ such a technology. Critics say it's unclear if the technology can be implemented at a cost that can justify the effort, and question whether it is robust enough to survive the rough-and-tumble life span of paper money.
A spokesman for the European Central Bank (ECB) in Frankfurt, Germany confirmed the existence of a project, but was careful not to comment on its technologies. At least two European semiconductor makers contacted by EE Times, Philips Semiconductors and Infineon Technologies, acknowledged their awareness of the ECB project but said they are under strict nondisclosure agreements.
The euro will become "the most common currency in the world" at midnight on Jan. 1, when 12 nations embrace it, according to Ingo Susemihl, vice president and general manager of RFID group at Infineon. The ECB and criminal investigators in Europe are already on high alert, worried not only about counterfeiting of a currency most people haven't seen, but also of a possible increase in money laundering, given the euro's broad cross-border reach.

Right...like in a darkened bedroom as you crouch down waiting for your attacker... The squeeze cocker is a solution for a non-existent problem.  Do you really think a P7 is intrinsically safer than a Sig226 which has no operator manipulated safety?
Having a weapon that goes click clack is a detriment.
