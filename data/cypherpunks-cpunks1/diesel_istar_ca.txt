Douglas Diesels Limited
of Nova Scotia, Canada
Has been working on a project with cooperation with several other companies. This project includes construction and turn on of commuication cables at sea. The amount of time spent on this is 11 months to the day. Once the whole operation is up and running the shares will be taken to the Toronto Stock Exchange, We are in the process of creating a company called "Canber Communications", here in Canada. This company exsists of 100 million shares. So far up to date we have buyers for 14.5 million shares at $10.00 a share. However, we are trying to sell off 49 million preferred shares in total. We are looking for investors and people to help us find investors. If we can agree upon a reasonable commision we would be willing to give each broker a percentage of shares to sell. Anyone interested in doing business with us and would like more information on this must sign a non disscloure agreement. If interested let us know and we will forward the non disclosure agreement.
