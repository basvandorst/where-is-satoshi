While I'm certainly not saying "I don't buy it", how does this  reconcile with the reality of The Silk Road still being in existance.  One would think that governments would use these techniques against  the site if for nothing more than to catch/punish them for all the tax  evasion going on.
If this paper is true, the only reason I could think of why TSR is  still alive is because it is some kind of government front, though  there is no evidence of that at all.

While I'm American, I've been paying close attention to the Wikileaks  Party in Australia. Could it be the political embodiment of the  cypherpunk movement?
Regardless of what some think of Julian Assange, he certainly holds  true to the cp ethic and the parties belief in accountability,  privacy, and justice, seem well aligned with the movement.
So what do you think? Is their finally a political party more closely  aligned with the cypherpunk ideal than the Libertarians?

There's definately a chance it could become corrupt. But I think the  big difference between the Wikileaks Party and other, more traditional  parties, is that the WLP is focused on more than just grabbing power.  The whole organization is about speaking truth to power, destroying  secrets, informing the populace, and holding those in power  accountable. That a little different than most others.
Of course that could all be hyperbole just like Obama's promises of  change but we don't know yet.  While I agree that a cryptoanarchist  poses a bigger threat to the power structure than a political party  does, could this not be a good forward step?

The solution *could* be to host their own mail server if it were made
easy enough for them. I'm thinking something like a Raspberry Pi with
very well designed web UI for simple configuration and management.
Include a nice webmail client and even most non-techies could probably
do this.

I've looked into the Pirate Party but, at least from the American side
of things, they seem like a 'one hit wonder' who's nearly solely focused
on IP law reform. Perhaps this isn't the same in other places (I can't
imagine they would have won major elections with a single issue
platform) but here in the States, where they exist, it seems to be the case.
