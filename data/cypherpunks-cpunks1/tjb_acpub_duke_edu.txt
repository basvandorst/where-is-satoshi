@_subject: Update of Secure Edit a0.3.3->a0.3.4 
UPDATE/PATCH OF *SECURE EDIT* for Mac
FROM a0.3.3 to a0.3.4
(AND MAILING LIST NOTICE)
There was a bug in Secure Edit a0.3.3 that would cause it to
crash when setting a default startup pass phrase on 68k macintoshes, but
not power macintoshes, which is what I was testing it on.
I was not planning to release any upgrades before a major update and
release in which I would overhaul most of the program, including changes
advised by Colin Plumb and others. However, I thought this was important
enough to release a patch.
I have uploaded a patch to upgrade a0.3.3 to a0.3.4, as well as a a0.3.4
package, to ripem.msu.edu in the directory /pub/crypt/mac. These correct
the bug. However, please save your work regularly as well as before using
this feature, just to be safe. I am overhauling much of the program
completely for the next release.
The method for verifying the default password has also been changed from
the previous "baroque" method. Now, it takes the MD5 hash of the key,
encrypts this hash on the key, and uses the first 8 bytes of the
resulting ciphertext to validate the default startup key.
Please report any problems/suggestions/improvements you may have
regarding Secure Edit.
Also, if you wish to be on a list of email addresses that will receive
information about Secure Edit updates or other Miyako Software releases, please send me an email to that effect. Anonymous IDs are,
of course, fine. No code will ever be sent by email. Actual programs and source code must be FTP'd from ripem.msu.edu

@_subject: setting up an non remailer 
setting up an anon remailer
To those who might know the answer....
I'm running a power mac here, and I have an ethernet port and my own IP
address. To do email, I telnet to my University's unix system.
I was thinking, this sort of arrangement might allow me to set up an anon
remailer. Does anyone know if I can do this? If the technology is available?
If there is a way to do this from a macintosh, I'd like to give it a try.
Of course, I would ask the sys admins if necessary for permission. (i.e.,
if it can come straight to my IP address then it isn't necessary I assume).

@_subject: Are there *any* internet services runnable from powerpc 
I'm still thinking I'd like to provide some internet services from my power
mac. I have my own IP address and the folks at network services said they
don't mind if I run a WWW server, and they will even change the name
assigned to my IP address if I don't like it. So it sounds to me like I can
provide internet services. I hesitate to run a web server because I hear
there are lots of security bugs and I won't subject my mac to that. I am
looking for a unix emulator that is freeware for the macintosh. I was
directed to one apparently freeware unix platform for the mac by someone on
the cypherpunks list, but it says it does not support ethernet which is how
I am interfaced.
I have a power mac 7100 with an ethernet port to the internet. Does anyone
know if I could, for example, get scripts for Eudora to snarf mail and run
a keyserver, or set up an anon remailer, or do anything at all remotely
cool and for the betterment of the crypto/privacy/pgp/etc. services
available to the internet public? I could leave my mac on 24/7 serving up
services. When I'm debugging code it might crash, but I suppose there
should be fail-safe systems.
It doesn't seem like I can do much unless I buy a unix emulator, and I
don't have the money for that. I'm a student.

@_subject: RELEASE: Secure Edit a0.3.1 for Macintosh 
Miyako Software(tm) presents...
            SECURE EDIT(tm) VERSION ALPHA 0.3 FOR MACINTOSH
SECURE EDIT is an editor designed for editing sensitive text buffers. It is
designed to prevent plaintext from ever being written to disk, even
if only momentarily. You might fail to overwrite or encrypt such plaintext
properly, or your opponent might be able to retrieve some of the information
even though you wiped it (see docs for details). Word Processors generally create temp and scratch files that leave plaintext on your drive whether you like it or not. Secure edit fixes this problem. Sometimes you need to quit in a hurry and have all your data encrypted and saved. Or you might prefer to have your files encrypted at all times so that you never forget to
re-encrypt a file you worked on. Secure edit sports the following features to serve these and your other data security needs:
* Plaintext is never written to disk - Secure Edit locks all sensitive   buffers in memory so that virtual memory will never swap them to disk.
  This includes the text you are editing as well as any encryption keys
  in use.
* Secure Edit never creates plaintext temp or scratch files, ever.
* Secure Edit offers the option of saving files directly in encrypted format
  so you never have plaintext on the hard drive.
* Your data is compressed and encrypted in RAM with the IDEA algorithm, then
  written to disk in encrypted format. The key is the MD5 hash of your   passphrase. This is the same basic technique used in PGP conventional   encryption. The SHA hash and the MD5 hashes are used to create information
  against which to validate keys without compromising their security. See   docs for more details.
* Secure Edit can mantain a secure, private clipboard, interconverting with
  the system clipboard only when you use OPTION-cut,copy, and paste. This
  prevents the system from getting a copy of your sensitive data and possibly
  writing it to disk, or leaving it around for another user to see.
* Secure Edit can open foreign text files, and DOD wipe them on request when
  you save the file in encrypted format.
* Secure Edit offers a default passphrase option so you only need to enter   your passphrase once. It also offers the option of validating your phrase
  against secure validation information that can be used to check that you
  have entered your standard pass phrase, but which cannot be used to recover
  the passphrase by an opponent. This prevents you from saving under a
  bad passphrase and losing data.
* Secure Edit offers a time-out option, whereby it will save all files and
  quit after a certain idle time period
* Secure Edit offers an option-quit feature, whereby it will assume it is   okay to save all files, and save and quit as quickly as possible
* As far as I am personally aware, Secure Edit does not have any bugs which
  could cause data loss. However, as I am the only person who has used it
  until now, I am considering it an ALPHA TEST RELEASE, version a 0.3. Hence,
  store important information at your own risk. Save regularly!
* Secure Edit alpha 0.3 is available to U.S. citizens in the U.S. at an   ITAR-compliant site near you. I'm presently uploading it to ripem.msu.edu
  and others.
* The source code is, of course, available for your inspection.
* Questions about Secure Edit should be directed to me, at Thanks for your attention.

I'm sending this message to test the waters regarding how useful such
a new site would be. I considered setting up a new PGP keyserver
earlier, but the consensus of net.opinion when I asked about it seemed
to be that there were plenty of keyservers that worked fine already, so
I abandoned the idea. :-) Does anyone have an opinion they could send me

as public archives for programs to password-protect hard drives, encrypt
files and volumes, monitor AppleShare access, do stegnanography, and so

dictionaries, password crackers, interesting documentation and clippings
from EMAIL and net.posts from people who know their stuff, and so on.

eligibility, whereupon I'd create for them a non-anonymous account. The
non-crypto stuff would be in directories accessible to anonymous FTP
This sounds like a lot of fun and I'd enjoy running it. However, if,
like my keyserver idea, I wouldn't be doing anything really new or
useful, it might just be a way for me to spend lots of time not getting
much useful stuff done. :-)

mean potential users. No mail to this effect would mean folk already
have sufficient FTP resources. Any opinions appreciated.

This is not exactly what secure edit does. It hashes in the following
manner to generate a session key:
MD5 [ (128-bit salt) MD5[passphrase] 0 MD5[passphrase] 1 MD5[passphrase] 2 ... ]
to get the session key. The 0, 1, 2 is a single byte. So there is only one
level of nesting of the hashes. This is actually a common and well-regarded
technique for increasing the security of weak passphrases.

I'm not going to waste any more bandwidth sending the announcement (sorry),

If you'd like to verify the signature on the announcement for secure edit,
please finger me at tjbryce at amherst.edu. In my plan is contained the
announcement with a valid signature from Miyako Software's public key.
Even though I had "treat source file as text" selected, I think there must
have been left over some weird character in there that is not transmitted
through email properly. What I did to get the signature to validate was
place the announcement in my plan at amherst.edu, finger myself, copy the
signed announcement, detach the invalid signature with mac pgp, sign the
leftover text and copy just the resulting signature, log back onto amherst,
and I edited the plan.txt file, pasting the new signature onto where the
old signature used to be. FINALLY WORKED!

@_subject: ideal secure personal computer system 
Here's a question: if one were designing for oneself a secure personal
computer system, for use in, say, word processing, spreadsheet,
communications, the usuals - what system would one purchase and how would
one set it up?
For example, on the Mac I would envision this as the ideal system:
(1) Get a power mac
(2) Partition the hard drive into two partitions:
    install the system folder on one and a copy of CryptDisk
    make this the startup partition and make it READ ONLY with aliases to
    folders you want to be modiyfable (such as Eudora Folder in the sys folder)
    place these folders on the encrypted partition
(3) Completely fill the other partition with a CryptDisk file so there is no
    room for other stuff to be written. Adjust the partition size if needed.
(4) Install a screen saver (such as shareware Eclipse) that will password lock
    the screen after a few minutes of inactivity, and set CryptDisk to dismount
    the external partition after a few minutes of inactivity (or longer)
This would be a basic setup. If one had more complex ideas, such as setting
it up so casual onlookers would not notice the system was protected, you
could do things like have a decoy normal partition with system folder to
boot from by default, to be bypassed with an external locked system folder
disk, after which one could dismount the decoy partition and mount the
encrypted partition.
If locking the startup volume turns out to be too much of a pain, one could
install trashguard from Highware software and set it to triple overwrite
deleted files, and otherwise not lock the startup partition.
How would things work on Windows 95? I imagine most of the old DOS-based
encryption utilities may have compatibility problems with W95. What would a
similar ideal system be for a PC?

@_subject: ideal secure personal computer system 
Thanks for the link to the CryptoBook stuff - it's useful info.
Could you address further the issue of plaintext from scratch files,
virtual memory, and so on, from the standpoint of your CryptoBook system?
The advice to make the temporary directory on the encrypted volume and so
on, and the general pointer to wipe utilities, is good, but is there a
systematic way of making sure *no* plaintext gets written to disk, or if it
gets written, that it is properly wiped, with this system?
I believe there is a utility for DOS to intercept calls to delete (I'm a
mac person, pardon if I'm getting this wrong) and wipe all files before
deletion. (Real Delete? Secure Delete?) Would this be compatible with
Win95/cryptobook, and if so, would this address virtual memory concerns?
The larger question I'm wondering about here is, if one were starting from
scratch and trying to build a maximally secure Mac/Dos/Windows/Unix/other
platform for oneself to do one's daily work, which machine and what
configuration would one want? The mac I configured earlier seems pretty
darn good, can anyone see a flaw in it? I think the pain in the neck
resulting from the write-protected startup volume could be problematic, but
aliases to writeable files/folders on the encrypted partition should solve
most of this. I may set this up on my own mac to test it out, when I have
some time.

@_subject: ideal secure personal computer system 
The fact that you can start up and run your system from a CD rom proves
that you can lock your startup disk. Grab a DISK TOOLS disk from your most
recent system installer disks (mine is 7.5) and flip the write protect tab,
then start up from it. Clipboard works, too. I haven't worked with such a
system extensively enough to see if there are any glitches (such as copying
large amounts of stuff to the clipboard, etc.) but it should get the job
done for the truly paranoid.
I have a few items in the system folder presently aliased out onto other
disks - my Eudora Folder is on an encrypted partition, and there's no
reason one couldn't do this with the whole preferences folder and other
Right. I'm proposing this as a compromise if you wish to trade security for
Colin Plumb gave me estimates of what you needed to wipe a disk clean once,
which he researched for SFS. It depends on whether the erasure pattern is
custom designed for the data to wipe. It was something vaguely like (don't
quote me) 15 passes if custom designed, and 25 if not. This refers, as I
recall, to data freshly written to the disk. Data that hangs out for a
while 'leaks' deeper into the disk, with adjacent molecules becoming
aligned further between tracks and deeper into the disk and is harder to
erase. A dejanews search under colin's name should yield his extensive
posts on this topic.
