Bruce Schneier to speak on "The Future of Privacy" Tuesday
You are cordially invited to an exciting opportunity to hear the
renowned security expert, technologist, cryptographer, author and
thinker Bruce Schneier discuss "The Future of Privacy," sponsored by
the ACLU.
The recent NSA spying scandal is just the latest sign of our times -
how rapidly evolving technology is opening up new possibilities for
surveillance, and how governments and companies are rushing to
exploit them.  With his unique background, Bruce Schneier is
positioned to offer a fascinating and insightful perspective on the
future of privacy in America at a time of churning technological change.
This talk and discussion also kicks off of an exciting new ACLU
speaking series, The Forum on Technology & the Future, which will
feature experts discussing and debating cutting-edge technologies and
their implications for the future of civil liberties. Events will be
held on a roughly bi-monthly basis in Washington DC (a schedule is
available on the ACLU website at Looking forward to seeing you there,
Barry Steinhardt
