ROBERT'S INDEPENDENT RECORD STORE NEWSLETTER  If your anything like me and independent music store owner - you wonder how the music business will change in the next several years. I know one thing is for sure though, I probably would not be in the record business now if it hadn't been for my Musicware POS System. I don't know how I managed go so long without a computer in my store. My life has become so much easier and I am making more money by being able to reorder stock quickly and keep customers happy. I strongly suggest that you look into the MUSICWARE POS System for your store. WWW.MUSICWAREPOS.COM
