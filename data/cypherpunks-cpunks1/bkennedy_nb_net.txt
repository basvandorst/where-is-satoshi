I am not so much worried about the bank stealing money out of my account as I am worried about them loaning to deadbeat countries to support some governmental idea of foreign policy.  Then, of course, there is always the possibility that they will loan it to some deadbeat country, not because of the government, but because of just outright stupidity.

SINGAPORE (ITN) * Singapore announced rules Thursday  aimed  at  blocking
anti-government views and pornography on the Internet, adding to the thicket
of laws that regulate books, movies and public discussion here.
   But authorities insisted the latest rules -- one of the first attempts by
any country to screen the Internet -- do not amount to censorship.
   The  government  will  hand  out  annual  licenses  to  Singapore's three
Internet providers, as well as to political parties that maintain Web sites,
groups and individuals who run discussion sites on  politics  and  religion,
and on-line newspapers.
   Beginning  Monday,  these  groups  will  be  responsible for blocking out
material deemed objectionable by the government.  Violations will result  in
licenses being revoked.
   "We are not censoring discussion groups.  By registering these groups, we
are asking that they behave responsibly," said  the  Singapore  Broadcasting
Authority, a governmental regulatory body.
   The  free-wheeling  global  computer  link  up has provided the Singapore
government a major dilemma.
   Singapore promotes the Internet as part of its objective to make the city
of 3 million people the hub of high-tech industry.  One in three homes has a
computer,  and the number of Internet accounts doubled last year to 100,000.
A government plan calls for connecting each home to a  computer  network  by
   But  the Internet has also brought into Singapore what the government had
successfully kept out for years -- criticism of the administration  and  the
judiciary, pornography and discussions on race and religion.
   About  10  SBA  officials  will  surf  the  net  daily  for objectionable
material.  A government-appointed panel of prominent  citizens  will  decide
what  is  objectionable,  said  Goh  Liang  Kwang,  chief  executive  of the
Broadcasting Authority.
   But he admitted that even with regulations,  the  SBA  cannot  completely
police the Internet.
   "We  don't  claim  we  can  regulate  the  Internet.  We  just don't want
objectionable material to be easily available. We want to keep our immediate
neighborhood clean," said Goh.
   Still, a lot of rules remain vague.  Although political parties will need
   licenses, it is not clear if individual
politicians would be allowed  to  post  anti-government  views  on  bulletin
boards.  The  SBA  guidelines  say  it will not allow contents that "tend to
bring the government into hatred or contempt,  or which excite  disaffection
against  the  government." The definition of hatred or contempt has not been
spelled out.
   The government will also ban: -- contents that jeopardize public security
   or national defense.  -- anything  that  ridicules  racial  or  religious
   groups.  --  the  promotion  of religious deviations or occult practices.
   -- the "gross exploitation" of violence,  nudity,  sex or horror.  -- the
   depiction  of  "sexual perversions" such as homosexuality.  All these are
   already banned from books, magazines, newspapers, movies and
public forums.

     _________________________________________________________________
   RADICAL plans to take the genetic fingerprints of everyone in Britain
   and put them on a compulsory ID card are being considered by Labour.
   A database of DNA identities would be used to solve crimes and cut
   benefit fraud. Frank Field, tipped as a possible Social Security
   Secretary in a Labour government, has drafted proposals to produce a
   genetic database of the nation. Blood samples would taken from babies
   and from people applying to live in Britain.
   The samples would be used to extract DNA. Only identical twins have
   the same DNA, making it a more accurate fingerprint. Chris Smith,
   shadow social security secretary, confirmed that the party was
   examining the plans. "We are not ruling them out. We are determined to
   cleanse the national insurance system of fraud."
   John Wadham, director of the pressure group Liberty, said it was
   incredible that a senior Labour politician could suggest such a
   "draconian" measure which breaches European law. "There is no evidence
   that such a massive invasion of our privacy would do anything very
   much towards stopping crime."
   Mr Field, chairman of the Commons Social Security Select Committee,
   also advocates taking compulsory fingerprints from every citizen as a
   fall back to confirming a person's identity. The combination of
   genetic and physical fingerprints would be used to "rebuild the
   national insurance system", Mr Field said yesterday.
   Each person would be given a number at birth, combining national
   insurance and health numbers, which would tally with their genetic
   code. The information would go on a computerised identity card. It
   would also contain an individual's address, medical history or
   criminal record. It would be impossible to claim benefit without the
   card. Mr Field believes that Mr Blair is "sympathetic" to the
   proposals and that any opponents would be "Old Labour". Mr Blair will
   express his determination to reduce fraud in a speech tomorrow.
   Mr Field, MP for Birkenhead and described as one of Blair's "gurus",
   believes that the scheme would eradicate the use of multiple
   identities by benefit fraudsters and wipe off a large part of the
   annual �2.5 billion cost of social security fraud. There are millions
   of bogus national insurance numbers in circulation. It would also
   allow police to solve more crimes because traces of semen, hair or
   skin found at a burglary or rape would lead to the culprit.
   Ann Widdecombe, the Home Office Minister, said: "There are huge
   practical and resource implications. Think what it would cost to test
   every person in the country." Mr Wadham said there was no guarantee
   that the benefits would follow. "Not all fraud is to do with bogus
   national insurance numbers. I do not understand why, even if you have
   an identity card, you would need a genetic database."
   Mr Field advocates setting up a commission to regulate the use of the
   information. It is unlikely that any policy would be announced before
   the general election. Mr Blair, who is known to be looking for radical
   ideas on social security, has told shadow ministers to "think the
   unthinkable" and remind the public that "with rights come
   responsibilities".
