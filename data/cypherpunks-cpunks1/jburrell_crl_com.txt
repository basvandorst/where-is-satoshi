@_subject: PGP-Pine Scripts? 
Are there any scripts out there to set Pine 3.91 up to use PGP for message encryption and signing? I would prefer to stay away from installing a 1MB+ executable, since I have neither the root privlidges on this machine or the disk space for such an endevour. Thanks.

Is there an encrypted filesystem for Linux out there? I'm speaking of something like Secure File System(DOS), but for Linux. The kernel in question is 1.1.59, soon to be upgraded to a later version. IDE drive, ex2fs formatted file system.

I'm quite concerned about that myself. Is there a way to tell if your
computer has been tampered with? Assume that looking at the case doesn't
do much good (they get by that easy), and if they want to hide the bug
they can. Voltage monitoring? Ah. Glad you put in the "No, I'm not Lance" part. I was wondering when I read that paragraph. :)

I can't speak for the rest of the rant-viewers, but I don't think that's the real Detweiler. In fact, the guy is (almost) denying that he is the real Detweiler anyway. I'm sure csn.org has been flooded with complaints. I really don't know, though, if the messages originated at csn.org or not. I never checked the headers, as I know the account exists.

Well, no, but I do have access to a lot of computer equipment(*) and some 'unusual' connectivity software floating around.
* - The 'good' powered stuff isn't here; just this thing that runs like a
486/10 on valium.
I seldom have any visitors to speak of here.
That describes me perfectly.
I don't.
The times for much of my activity could be described as quite unusual.
That's definately me. Ask anyone who knows me.
I guess this proves I'm a spook. My friends probably suspected as much... :-)
You know, now that I think about it, I probably *am* quite "mysterious" to the great majority of people who know of me personally (off-net), for a variety of reasons.

@_subject: PRZ encrypted voice software release imminent 
This doesn't fall into line with the "mainstream" of personal computing, of
course, but does anyone know if there is a planned release for a Linux
version, preferably with SoundBlaster support? I mention Soundblaster
support because, even though it's old, it seems to be the standard, at least
indirectly. The GUS has a Soundblaster emulation mode, for instance, if I'm
not mistaken.
Of course I suppose the real reason I'm asking is because I run Linux and
have a Soundblaster. :)

*Sigh*. Are we really ready to go back to UUCP? It looks like we'll have
to. That is, if someone doesn't set up a couple cryptographically enhanced
subnets first, or come up with some better idea. Interesting prospect,
actually. Anyone wish to comment on the prospect of a double blind server, set
outside U.S. borders, that can act as an interface to the rest of the
world, perhaps encrypting or stego'ing the data transfered between it and
the user? Basically, an anonymous remailer that acts as a cross between an NNTP, POP3, and SMTP servers.
God help us all.

@_subject: Responding to Exon -- technology is not enough 
[This document was Exonized at The Exon-Hyde Center for Thought Cleansing.]
You're right here, definately. While I'm not volunteering, I think
something could be written, such as an encrypted UUCP transfer system, and
a better premail. PGP is reasonably user friendly, if you have any kind of memory at all. It
isn't, of course, user friendly if you have to save your message to a
file, shell, encrypt it, exit the shell, load it back in, and send it. I
think that there is the major problem with PGP. I *know* that kind of
thing is a problem with chaining anon mailers, unless you have installed
an application such as Premail. I think that we'll eventually see applications such as Eudora pop up with PGP support, directly or indirectly.
I was thinking more along the lines of an offline message packet that the
server creates, encrypts, chains through anon mailers with an response
block, and sends to you. You get it, run it through a filter, run your
offline reader, such as Yarn, write your replies, run another program to
get an encrypted, reply-blocked, ready to send packet, and drop it right
into the SMTP port. I don't know if the AOL and MSN software would even
allow this without difficulty, as I haven't seen it. I just used it as an example, though. I'm sure there are much better ideas
out there. Here's a chain of events:
1) Congress gets their wish, and it all passes.
2) President signs into law.
3) ISPs:
   a) Shutdown, which isn't really likely,
   b) Severely restrict service, or
   c) Tell the government where to shove it (and watch themselves       promptly prosecuted). After one or two ISPs are busted, the rest
      will "fall in line."
4) Someone gets caught writing "" in E-MAIL or on USENET, or    committing some other form of thought-crime, and is prosecuted.
5) While this person is fighting his or her impending exonization and    cleansing of dirty thoughts, the rest of us have our free speech    severely restricted. Would I be wrong in saying that it would take a    long time, and a lot of money to fight this up to the Supreme Court?
Then we risk the Supreme Court ruling in favor of Congress, however
unlikely that may seem. The S.C. could just as easily tell us to "exon off" to keep the world safe for mentally impaired children that, while smart enough to operate a computer and go looking for pornography, are damaged by it and/or the word "exon."

Assuming that this isn't contradicted by other parts of the legislation,
doesn't this outlaw distribution "to computer networks" software for
everything from compression to data structures to TCP/IP to ROT13 to PGP? The bad part is that they might "compromise" and, by the time its over with, it still outlaws non-GAK crypto. At least when its overly broad it has a better chance of getting laughed out of court.

ftp.csua.berkeley.edu:/pub/cypherpunks/filesystems/linux. I haven't looked through the code very hard yet, but I do wonder how the
passphrase and such is stored. If I run losetup and setup
anywhere that isn't secure from non-root processes, or that is kept after
the filesystem is unmounted? I figure the passphrase definately is removed
as soon as the filesystem is unmounted, and that this is stored in
protected kernel memory.

If you mean something like a 132x60 character terminal, you can get a
utility from Sunsite called SVGATextMode which will do that for you on a
standard VGA monitor, provided you have a graphics card which supports such a mode. I have an STB Nitro 2MB ISA card, and am running a 132x60 mode on a
14 inch monitor.
I think you mean /usr/spool/mail/postmaster, but I could be wrong. ;)
Indeed. :)
