@_subject: A Quote for the List 
Here's a quote I snagged off an h/p bbs... thought it was particularly
true of cipher-technology as well as computing in general.
As life moves to this electronic frontier, politicians and corporations are
starting to exert increasing control over the new digital realm, policing
information highways with growing strictness. Before we even realise we're
there, we may find ourselves boxed into a digital ghetto, denied simple
rights of access, while corporations and government agencies make out their
territory and roam free. So who will oppose the big guys? Who's going to
stand up for our digital civil liberties? Who has the techno-literacy
necessary to ask a few pertinent questions about what's going down in
cyberspace? Perhaps the people who have been living there the longest might
have a few answers.

@_subject: Avoiding snags in the Law : Remailers. 
In Message 19 Dec 92 19:45:33 EST,
     Perhaps the solution to this is to run encrypted remailers,
anonymously.  The remailer could either run on it's own, or under
instructions by an anonymous source [i.e PGPed instructions and software
updates signed by the owner who has created a second key for his identity
of remailer operator [Let's call him Oz].
         Joe creates an account on a random system, installing the nessicary
         software to run a PGP remailer.  This software would be modified to
         accept instructions from a specific anonymous identity, for which
         Joe creates one, leaving the public key with the remailer.  The
         remailer also has it's own key pair to decrypt and forward messages
         [of course].
         People could now route their messages through Joe's remailer to
         anywhere they wish.  The remailer should be set up to NOT keeps
         logs, except errors.
         Now Joe decides he wants to update his remailer with the latest
         scripts.  He mails te scripts [thru various remailers], encrpyted
         with the remailers key and signed by Oz's key.  The remailer
         decrypts the mail, verifies that it belongs to Oz, and updates
         itself.
In this way no person can be held responsible for mail passing thru it's
remailer.  The only way to stop such a remailer would be to downright shut
it down, or to communicate to Oz via the remailer [the scripts would allow
Oz to pick up any mail left directly to the remailer withour a forwarding
header -- of course it would reroute the messages, encrypted, thru various
other well-known remailers].

     Perhaps they could alter the message, use a bogus public key, and

     I didn't realize you had included a signed key.  Minus one point
     for research.  Yes, people SHOULD know not to use a publicly posted
     key.  But do they?
     Then posting your public key was clearly the right thing to do.  I
     have noticed; however, that people have posted their public key
     along with a signed message before [there was a discussion on mangled,
     signed plaintext] and thought I would mention this to anybody who
     thought they were using infallible methods or authentication.
     I must urge everybody not to accept any key from a source other then
     person to person [or using a fone call to exchange MD5 hashes] unless
     it is signed by smoebody you HAVE exchanged keys with in this way.
     I hope nobody sees a message with a public key attached to it and says,
     "Oh!  There's a key I can add to my keyring", and abandons the entire
     key-exchange method.  TTFN!

I havn't waded thru the entire stream of CypherPunks mail yet... but I

If the clipper chip DOES in fact become widespread, in telephones, modems,

cypher and PGP keys] that uses the same pinouts as the Clipper chip.  We, on
the list, have been waiting for devices with the capability for encryption..
and it sounds as if ATT will be making it easier for us!  Of course there
might be some legal conflict with modifiying the devices.. and I think
that's where our battle begins.

message around for a specified # of times +/- a small random # [users
choice with a max. limit set by remailers].  The second to last
remailer would recognize the last remailer from it's public key
encrypted message [::Request-Remailing-To: FinalDestination] and send
it on down to the last remailer which would decrypt the final remailing
block using it's secret key and send the intended message to it's final
destination.  This would provide random remailing routes without
compromising the ending not originating location.  The first remailer
wouldn't know if it had just received a message from a person, or another

     So this doesn't seem possible to you, does it?  10 years to me seems

like USENET and mailing lists.  10 years AGO we were happy to have the
tiny 5 1/4" floppy disk as opposed to the 8".  Now we have flopptical and
WORM..  Perhaps the world of mainframes moves slower than the rest of the
world.. but that doesn't matter because in 10 years the many PCs will be on
the internet with ISDN with plenty of free cycles to maintain [or consult] a
database of positive reputations.
     It's not a way to RUN a society... it just happens.
     Isn't that what we have now?  If the DEA busted down your door could
you defend yourself?  If NSA wants to waste more of your money do they ask
you?  Because we have rules I think people are misled into thinking it's
