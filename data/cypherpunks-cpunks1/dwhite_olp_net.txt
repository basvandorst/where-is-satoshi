The boring recommendation: Debian
* Lots of eyeballs
* Timely security updates (well, timely as far as vendors go)
* A wealth of pre-packed software, which can be twiddled down to size
* Some fancy features out of the box (like remotely booting a LUKS
   encrypted root filesystem via an initramfs ssh daemon)
* Patching your locally installed (packaged) software must be done with
   Debian build scripts, or you quickly lose the benefits of the apt system
* Stupid patches have made it past the package maintainer (the OpenSSL
   2008 patch being the one that comes immediately to mind)
If you're willing to compile your own software or security updates, then I
think your choice of OS/distro may be mostly moot.
I'd recommend against a specialized security (linux) distro, unless you
know what you're doing. Support for many of them seems to be pretty spotty,
according to my unscientific observation from
