list about what your response will be if masked ninjas invade your home.  If
they end up shooting you (and I think their is a significant likelihood that

if never sells a single bushel, even a single peanut, on the alleged grounds that his act of growing a crop will affect what he and his family buy...and thus this affects the local Safeway store's business! Call it the "Suppression of Competition and Protection of Special Interests Ruling." (The usual sources, like Findlaw, have scads of references. This one is "Wickard v. Filburn.")
people to travel to New York instead of Iowa, on the grounds that these kinds of books "influence interstate commerce"? The mind boggles at what lawyers have done to these united states. Time to fire up the ovens and send them to the showers.)

people finally understand that Fedgov doesn't give a rat's ass about any
alleged 'right to privacy'. Americans allegedly have  right to 'keep and bear
arms' as well, spelled out on paper (currently being used as toilet paper in

headlines. "Two Dozen Crypto Munitions Exporters Arrested in Midnight
Raids; Ties to Money Laundering, Terrorists, Child Pornographers" would
get the AG's name in the papers and distract Congress's attention from
looking into just what BXA is doing. (Neal Knox noticed that criminal
shooting sprees seem to take place before Congressional votes on gun
restrictions. Maybe coincidence, maybe not. I'm extrapolating to a
different department.)
How about a small Pancho Cypherpunk? Come out with your pistolas buring or Districto Colombia VIPs in you reticula?
