A few years back i ran thru a paper emanating
from a navy labs researcher (i think the name was Peccora)
about using synchronised chaotic signal generators as a
signal scrambling/encrytpion scheme.
Has there been any kind of progress in this line of work,
practical applications ?

I agree with the assesment of where we may be going, but the
technology is available now.  (Marshall Rose uses it; if you want to
get mail into his private mailbox, offer him some $ via imbedded FV
authorizations in the mail, and it goes into his inbox.  If he thinks
it was worth his time, he doesn't charge you.)
Anyway, the code is defeintely available now.  The back end is a
little kludgy, but it was needed for an auto ley retreival script.
This could easily be hacked to include a +pubring=$people line.  The
script gives you a keyid, which you can then use to filter on, ie:
* -----BEGIN PGP
# the sender unknown script is below
? [ $KEYID = (`cat .buddies`) ]
# unknown returns a keyid, exits 1 if the key is known
# $output is to get the exit status. Othierwise, this would be a one liner.
OUTPUT=`pgp -f +VERBOSE=0 +batchmode  -o /dev/null`
echo $OUTPUT | egrep -s 'not found in file'
EV=$? if [ $EV -eq 0 ]; then         echo $OUTPUT | awk '{print $6}' exit $EV

@_subject: Cylink gives away encryption kit 
Cylink to offer free SDK for
  embedding encryption security   By Jessica Davis   InfoWorld Electric   Posted at 1:21 PM PT, Mar 29, 1996   Lobbing the latest bomb in a patent war over public key/private key
  encryption technology, Cylink Corp. will offer a Software Developers Kit
  (SDK) free-of-charge so that software companies can embed security and
  encryption technologies in their products.   Cylink's move to offer Passport Gold for free follows a failed attempt in
  federal court to stop another company, RSA Data Security Inc., from
  selling a similar kit allegedly based on Cylink patents.   The two companies have been engaged in a public relations feud, as well as
  a federal court patent dispute and IS mind share war over public key/private
  key/certificate authority encryption technology. Cylink lost the latest round
  in federal court in early March.   Cylink and RSA both participated in the creation of public key/private key
  technologies through their partnership, Public Key Partners. PKP was
  formed in 1990 to establish security standards to license to software
  vendors. The partnership fell apart over the patent dispute.   Cylink's PassportGold modules and APIs allow software developers to
  enable their applications to access national certificate authority electronic
  commerce and correspondence services that are planned by the U.S. Postal
  Service's ECS system and other commercial certificate authority facilities.   Cylink expects its revenue stream to come from a series of products,
  existing and planned, that enhance the speed and effectiveness of such
  encryption technologies. Cylink has also announced SecureFrame, one of
  those products that provides a high-speed data encryption and security
  system for frame relay-based Wide Area Network environments.   Working in conjunction with any public or private frame relay network,
  Secure Frame dynamically encrypts data while authenticating its source and
  destination, delivering throughput of up to 2.048 Mbps.   SecureFrame is priced at $5,995 and will ship in April.   Cylink also introduced SecureNode, an SNMP and TCP/IP-based data
  security hardware and software card for secure end-to-end data transfer
  and communication. The PC card is available now and provides network
  independent security management at the desktop level without hitting users
  with crippled CPU performance by acting as an "encryption and
  authentication accelerator."   SecureNode cards for ISA or for PCI are priced at $595 and $695
  respectively. The standalone software product is priced at $199.   Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Cylink can be reached at (800) 533-3958 or

<<"In other words it was stvation/devastation city">>
  It was lot worse than that on the Japanese-imperialits occupied islands of the Pacific when the Nisei troops choosenot to surrender and instead, mad last-ditch charges against AMerican lines - which killed not a small number of Americans. And of course, there were the suicide bombers.
Submarine operations don't cost zero lives, either. In fact, just plain old regular military logistics - keeping the boys mobilized and in place ina theatre of operations - don't cost zero lives, even if there are _no_ And while all the starvation and devastation was going on in Japanese
cities, the Japanese troops were torturing and murdering Allied POWs, and
Asian civilains in all the Japanese-occupied teritories. Those people
deserved liberation, too. I think you give your game away when you complain about how we were being unfair to Comrade Stalin.
As far as Pax Americana goes, the Japanese just _volunteered_ to_increase_
the payments they make to support the American garrison in Japan. The
non-Okinawans want us in their country. I guess they know that the
alternative is a Red Chinese garrison. And lots of other Asians are afraid of the same alternative - or of Japanese garrisons in their homeland. THey've "been there, done that".

Just as many people program their televisions using VCR-Plus codes to
record the shows they want (using TV Guide as a rating service)
it would be easy for any rating service to publish a list of the
codes for Approved Shows, Banned Shows, Rated-by-interestingness shows, etc.
without putting any government-mandated rating chip in the TVs
or forcing the TV producers to rate them (which also has a chilling
effect on the shows produced.)

On the other hand, of course, there are laws that are ostensibly for
the purposes of regulating businesses whose primary effect is
to limit the privacy or actions of individuals.  For instance,
California's law requiring that mailbox renters provide two forms of ID
and make their mailbox companies agents for service of process is ostensibly to "protect" consumers by regulating businesses that operate out of mailboxes (which the law claims there are 7 million of here);
it furthermore lets the Post Office specify what kind of ID to use
(which some local postmasters are far more extreme about than others),
and requires revealing True Addresses.

Remember that there's a major difference between "corporations"
and "business"; you seem to be mixing them up.  A corporation is
a legal fiction that treats a cooperative effort by one or more people
as if it were a person in itself, and normally involves limiting the
liability of the corporation's investors by putting it all on the
fictional person.  A business is what one or more people do to make money.
Most corporations are businesses, though not all.
Governments can legitimately tell corporations what to do because
that's part of the price of the legal fiction; a government can't
abuse a corporation because you can't beat up a legal fiction,
though it can say "Poof!  You're not a legal fiction any more",
and conversely, if the people who own the legal fiction don't like
what the government's telling it to do, they can dissolve it.
(Governments also enjoy regulating non-corporate businesses,
but they're no longer on solid moral ground.)
How are you going to _know_ that a "violation" occurred, if company A
tells company B your address or favorite liquor?  Only by having access
to the records of both companies.  Getting that through the courts,
for only the parts of their information relevant to you, is better than
blanket permission for the government to rummage through their files,
but after the first lawsuit lets investigators in, everything they've got
is clam bait anyway.  It's still major privacy violation - for the company
whose machines are being violated, and for the non-suing individuals
whose data is also on those machines.  #				Thanks;  Bill

Basic laws of politics... The reason the telecommunications bill got
signed into law in spite of the Exon ammendment is that the bill it was attached to was politically unvetoable. Not only was telecommunications reform an important part of the Clinton/Gore Agenda from 92, but also the amount of lobbying and financial muscle being put behind the bill was such that a veto just because of the CDA would not have been sustained - further, such a veto would be perfect fodder for this Autumn's festival of negative delights. Since it is clear that the courts must reject this part of the bill, it's better to denounce the measure, but sign the bill anyway, knowing that the nasty bits will be cut out (or rather, the nasty bits won't be ... oh, you know what I mean).
If the CDA wasn't so blatantly unconstitutional, then I believe that the
President would have vetoed it- the anti-abortion elements make it
completely unacceptable; however, since the courts really have no choice but to remove the indeceny provisions, Bill gets a pretty nice equivalent of a retroactive line-item veto.
Talking about Negative Ad's: there's a great new book out called "Going
Negative" by Stephen Ansolabehere and Shanto Iyengar. This book is an
extended write up of some extremely well designed experiments designed to
measure the effect of poltical advertisments on the public. For perhaps
the first time ever in the Social Sciences, the authors performed actual,
real, honest to goodness experiements, and the data are quite convincing.
The most worrying results are that 1) Political advertising is isomorphic to the prisoners dilemma, and once
an opponent uses a negative ad, the only way to respond is with
2) One of the main effects of negative advertising is not to change peoples votes, but to reduce turnout.

Actually, I think the primary targets will be either the middle level manager types, or the ones who have attracted a substantial amount of bad publicity by "following orders."  Lon Horiuchi (the sniper who shot Vicki Weaver) for example, would be a excellent example of a person who'd try to claim, "I was just following orders."  Okay, maybe he was, but so was Adolph Eichmann.  Once the tax collectors/enforcers were targeted, the rest of the government wouldn't be able to operate, and would collapse.
And, of course, you've just ruined their lives.  Think about it.  By doing this, it is made absolutely, completely, and abundantly clear to them that THEY are considered "the enemy" and that their lives are forever put at risk.   Previously, government employees could hold their heads up high and be proud of their "public service."  Now, if they're discovered, they have to disappear.  Does this treatment sound familiar?  Their job description and circumstances will more closely resemble that of a Mafia enforcer than a proud public servant.  They'll have to teach their children to lie about what their parent does, rather than risk getting exposed.
Who, exactly, would want to work for the government under such circumstances?  Remember, we're not just talking about a tiny fraction of their number; if the most egregious ones were hidden the ones that were less secure would be killed in their place.
Remember, the only reason the government can even afford so many employees is because taxes are collected; what happens when literally every IRS agent resigns to avoid the bullet or bomb?  The remainder, the "less bad" ones, couldn't be paid.  At that point, government collapses.
Except that you can't do this for every government employee, and who's going to want to work for the government if it is made clear to them that someday they'll either be killed, or discovered, or they will have to "go underground" to survive.  Not a very good prospect.  And what happens if they think there's a fairly good chance that my system will succeed?  Most people want to be able to retire with a pension; what's the prospect for collecting a pension from a demolished government?!?
Then they'll target the "names," the ones who show their faces.  See how this works?  If the only way  you can maintain the government is to keep them all absolutely anonymous, then that government has FAILED.
Furthermore, this system's anonymity allows disgruntled public employees the chance to collect money by "turning in" their bosses to the public's ire; if the personnel list for the government is nominally a secret, it will "leak" eventually and those on the list will be followed, confirmed, and targeted.
I'm not a betting man, but if I were forced to place a bet, your position doesn't have a prayer.

I guess I've gotten turned around on this -- last week I was arguing your But:  China's problem is internal, not external, and it's political, not sexual.  Let's assume that they can build a successful firewall -- despite the fact that the people here on this list who design and install such firewalls for a living don't believe that the Chineese plan is feasible.  Let's assume that they can prevent people from grabbing photos from playboy.com.  So what?
Who's in a position to formulate devastating criticisms of China's
government?  Americans?  Or people who live under the system and
understand it?  And what's subversive, anyway?  Breasts enhanced with
silicon and airbrushing, or plain honest talk about liberty and
government? Any net that lets the Chineese people publish and talk to one another is going to create problems for the government.
On top of that, the firewall isn't even going to keep out foreign traffic. The firewall model doesn't work for internal security -- it assumes that
the people on the inside are trustworthy, and it focuses on protecting the
internal net from people on the outside.  The Chineese have to deal with people on the inside trying to subvert the wall by building illicit links via telephone lines or satellite channels.
Let's put it another way.  Suppose a company has a strong firewall installed by a first rate security consultant.  If an employee who has access to the internal net puts a modem on his machine and lets anyone who wants to dial in and connect to the internal net, what good does the firewall do?  You can't come in over the Internet, but you can come in over a pots line.  Either way, you've got your access.

At the risk of blowing my usual horn, I would argue that one advantage in vocal, common, and loudly hostile talk against government is that they have begun to understand how unhappy we are with them.  To make an analogy with late-1700's France,  the sound of a guillotine being tested probably had a remarkable effect on the upper strata of their society; likewise, dicussions of how we can all chip in and bump off the whole lot of the bastards might remind a few of they key government players that they are not immune from eventual retribution.  Resulting in "a lot of turnover."
If we make a "reasonable assumption" that most of those government employees aren't stupid, and they discover that the prospect for Crypto-Anarchy (trademark owned by Tim May?) is good, it seems reasonable to assume that they'll want to avoid being around when THE END comes for their employer.

Bingo!   That's why this system will be so effective; it will DETER bad behavior on the part of the government and its agents.
Yup; it's interesting that Franz didn't see this... Maybe he just didn't
WANT to see it!
Your question was actually a two-parter.  I will separate it below and comment on the pieces:
"Who needs leaders"?  Think about this, carefully.  The current political system is based on the idea that if you don't like the way things are being done, you have to publicize your unhappiness, to organize, and for that  you normally "need" leaders.  With "Assassination Politics," _leaders_ will not only not be necessary, they might be the prime targets for unhappy people!  But this will work both ways:  "Christian Coalition" LEADERS will be targets themselves if they publicly advocate the killing of abortion doctors.
I wish there was some sort of "perfect, easy solution" to this dilemma, but it's possible there isn't.  Ultimately, anybody who does anything that angers enough people, ENOUGH, will be a potential target.  I don't think this is a major admission however; society has ALWAYS been this way.  In the early 1600's in Salem, women were killed simply due to false accusations that they engaged in 'witchcraft."  Governments have prosecuted (and persecuted) people for violation of what we now call victimless crimes.  In the pre-1960's South, being black was a de-facto "crime":  They could be arrested, tried, and convicted on a pretense.  Over 60% of prison cells are filled with people who sold chemicals (drugs) to willing buyers.
I think it's clear that there are ALREADY plenty of violations of rights going on; at most, you can claim that "Assassination Politics" is "imperfect" in the sense that it doesn't completely solve this problem.  But since I do genuinely believe it will eliminate war, militaries, governments, taxes, and other evils, I think we'll end up with a far better society than we have today.
All is not lost, however.  I contend that society would likely IMPROVE to the point where the kind of behavior you want to avoid will not commonly happen.  Wishful thinking?  Well, consider a point which was driven home to me a week ago at a dinner with my parents, sister and brother in law, and my two nieces, ages 4 and 9.  We were eating spareribs, and my father (age 65) commented that such meat used to be considered trash meat, and "only the niggers bought it."  (BTW, my father was not and is not a bigot, quite the opposite; he used this terminology to relate the general opinion during the time frame he grew up in; he used this terminology to reflect on and deride that public opinion back then.) My older niece looked mystified, and said she hadn't even HEARD the term "nigger." (and she's substantially above average in vocabulary and intelligence for age 9, BTW)   While I am not going to claim that bigotry is dead in the younger generation, I think it's clear that it went out of style in the 1960's and progress has since been made in eradicating most of its more egregious effects. In short, in that issue, society has improved, if by no other method than waiting for the bigots to die off naturally and develop a new generation of more tolerant people.  Call this "political correctness" if you wish (and I'm about as much an opponent of "political correctness" as you'll find) but the fact is that things are getting better with regards to race relations.
Similarly, I think that once public advocacy for killing abortion doctors and others was deterred (by judicious use of Assassination Politics, for example, even if a given example of such use might be considered "wrong" because it was a violation of "free speech") pretty soon it would be hard to gather much enthusiasm for such bad acts.  Few people would risk calling publicly for that; the next generation will "never" hear such a thing, etc. Is it unreasonable for me to suggest that over time, the faults you fear will tend to disappear?

The big question I have for you is, what do you mean by "stealth" PGP?
Do you want a PGP message which doesn't say to whom it is encrypted?
Or do you want a PGP message which does not even acknowledge that it
is a PGP message?  If what you want is the former, then that can fit
under the PGP API fairly well.  If you want the latter, it will not.
The reason is that PGP, by definition, is a self-describing packet
format.  Without that description there is no general way for the PGP
library to discover what kind of message it is parsing order to
perform the proper operation to open the message.  OTOH, if just the
keyID is missing, the library will happily try all the keys on your
secret keyring until one succeeds or they all fail (I'm not sure if
this is implemented, but it fits quite nicely under the API).
The other question I have is: who do you think the "customers" of PGP
are?  If you think the majority of PGP's customers are the
crypto-privacy activitst types, you are highly mistaken.  PGP has hit
the main stream, and is being used by many non-crypto-aware people.
Probably more of them than there are of us.

The issue of what I do with my time is a red herring. As it happens, many
folks in the "cyberspace activism" spend as much time or more as I do on
the Net. In any case, who cares how I spend my time?
I also note that for several years Perry was clearly spending a whole lot
more time than even I am now on the Net, making the "Top Ten Usenet
Posters," or somesuch.
I am sure that when Perry was a Shearson-Lehman, or Lehman Brothers, or
whatever it was called, and was posting several articles an hour on
Extropians, Cypherpunks, Libernet, Usenet, etc., that he would have roughly
 "Perry, you are
writing too much--some of us are trying to get some work done!" He would
likely have dismissed their complaints as irrelevant, that no one is forced
to read his articles.
Likewise today. No one is forced to read my posts, Perry's posts, or anyone
else's posts. This is what filters are for. As it happens, I do *not* read
all of the posts here. In fact, I delete about 90% of them after scanning
the first paragraph, the subject, and the author. Takes me about 15
seconds, tops, to do this, and sometimes I'm even faster. (Do the math: I
can "dispose of" about 50 or 60 messages a day in 10-15 minutes...and this
is about the best that can be hoped for, even if Perry were the moderator
and the 10 or so messages a day that are truly off the wall were screened
out...it just wouldn't change the basic time to screen all that much.)
Spare me, Perry. As I mentioned, you certainly used to write a truly vast
number of rants to Extropians, Libernet, and, yes, even Cypherpunks. A
check of the archives will show this clearly.
It is well and good that you apparently are now very busy and cannot write
your customary number of articles. But spare us the insinuations (in
several of your perrygrams) that because you are too busy to write you are
doing critical work and because some of us use our time to write we are
I write because setting down my thoughts and exploring ideas is far more
important to me than just about anything else I can imagine doing,
including writing C programs. If you don't like this, learn how to use
filters and filter me out, or leave the Cypherpunks list. Seems simple
enough to me.

Why There Exists No Middle Ground in the Crypto-policy Debate
[This message only appears to be posted anonymously, if you
 have the correct tools, you can learn my name and e-address.
 Take that auto-WWW indexers!]
Decius  recently presented an essay,
entitled ``Crypto-Absolutism,'' which described ``Why and how the
middle ground should be found in the crypto-policy debate.''  The
essay is clearly wrong in its assumptions and thus its conclusions.
Given the perceived flaws in the assumptions, his commentary must be
Within the context of this rebuttal, ``T-Camp Cypherpunks'' are those
``Cypherpunks'' (whatever they are :-) that follow a technology
evolution-based line of reasoning to arrive at the inevitable coming
of crypto-anarchy.  As well, ``A-Camp Cypherpunks'' are those that
advocate crypto-anarchy because they like the social and political
implications.  It is possible to be an A-Camp Cypherpunk or a T-Camp
Cypherpunk without being the other.  Of course, it is quite possible
to be both.  It has often been said on Cypherpunks, that ``we'' are
not a ``we''.  Decius falls into a trap by assuming that all
Cypherpunks are in the A-Camp.  This mistake colors the entire essay.
The main problem with Decius' essay is that it assumes that
Cypherpunks _merely_ advocate crypto-anarchy.  In fact, T-Camp
Cypherpunks do not stop at this puny point.  They observe that
crypto-anarchy is the _likely_ _outcome_ of the current technology
trend (this trend is discussed below).  Note that this observation of
fulfillment, if correct, is a far stronger statement than merely
advocating that crypto-anarchy should happen or would be a really good
A-Camp Cypherpunks also advocate that this trend should be exploited
to its conclusion, sooner rather than later, to preempt any massive
government crackdowns that would only prolong the transition pains.
The rationale being that these supposed government crackdowns have no
place in the natural evolution of a free society.  And that the
continuance of a free society is preferable to that of a move towards
a police state, which would be required to facilitate the useless ---
in the end --- crackdown on this information technology.
Decius is also wrong when he states that crypto-anarchy means people
will never again be accountable or recognized (pure A-Campers might
like this to be true, although I doubt it).  In the T-Camper's view,
crypto-anarchy means that people have the choice of when they wish to
be accountable and recognized for their statements and information
movement-related actions and when they wish otherwise.  People are not
forced under the crypto-anarchy model to be unaccountable or
unrecognizable.  Likewise, the crypto-anarchy model allows people to
ignore those that are unaccountable and unrecognizable, if they wish.
Decius fails to recognize that people could be recognized, and even
paid, for example, when operating under a pseudonym instead of
completely anonymously (this concept links two Cypherpunks favorites:
untraceable anonymous e-cash and anonymous reputations).
As primary counter-points to Decius on this issue:
- - The people who wrote the Federalists' Papers did so anonymously,
  yet I suspect that all were well-known and transacted business and
  other politics under their ``real names'' most of the time.
- - Individual articles are anonymously published in the _The Economist_
  yet I suspect that people are being paid to contribute information
  to this newspaper (at least, I know I am paying a lot per year, for
  a newspaper, to get the information :-).
- - The recently released ``Primary Colors'' book by Anonymous.  Yet
  this person, if the publisher is to be believed, is well-known to
  President Clinton (I think it may all just be a good marketing scam :-).

A govermental solution designed to regulate and legislate morality. History has demonstrated that every time a government makes attempts to enforce what is considered the basic tenants of civilized behavior then the game has already been lost. The people and the politics have become so corrupted that no form of democracy will survive for long - as it is dependant on the individual's willingness to abide by the principle of personal honesty.

I've just mailed off to Sameer Parekh the January '96 release of the
NRL IPv6 sources.  For those not in the know, this code implements the
IPsec protocol for both IPv4 and IPv6. IPsec is a cryptographic
protocol for securing IP datagrams -- it is now an IETF Proposed
Standard, defined in RFCs 1825-1829.
The code probably could use some work, but its not bad and a
reasonable start for all sorts of work.  This is a new version that
reportedly has lots of bug fixes -- I'm also given the impression it
may be the last NRL release of this code because the people doing the
work have left there -- if it gets adopted by the BSD community, it
will probably end up integrated into future NetBSD, BSDI and FreeBSDs,
which would be where to look for future releases.
The code should drop into BSDI almost out of the box -- it requires
more work for NetBSD and FreeBSD.

Which simply proves my point;  money is not the limiting factor, here.
But remember, Rushdie is merely ONE PERSON.  And keeping him safe has consumed a lot of resources.  You don't think the government could protect each of their most publically hated employees to a similar level if a reward of, say, $20,000 were put on each of their heads.  How much could we collect to "get" Lon Horiuchi, for example?  Or the hundred or so agents immediately participating in the initial Waco incident, or the dozen or so decision makers immediately above them?   Etc.
The Rushdie incident is simply so far removed from "Assassination Politics" that it can't possibly be used to refute it; I still believe it actually demonstrates how much effort somebody has to go to, to protect a targeted person.  One targeted person is easy to protect.  10,000 would be FAR harder.  And the moment a few of those guys got "whacked," the rest would want to resign their jobs and hope they would be allowed to retire in peace.
In a sense, qualitatively you absolutely correct, but (quantitatively) you're wrong.  I think the problem is that when most people hear the term "Assassination", they think of only the highest-level targets.  Quite the contrary; I think this system will get the medium and even the lower-level people FIRST, de-populating the government primarily by hurried resignations of worried people.  The remaining  people would be terrified to actually make anybody angry, and they wouldn't have a paycheck because they couldn't collect any taxes.  The whole system would collapse in a heap.

believe in strong government with strict regulation of business, an

no secrecy in government of the type required in the private sector,
bias toward small businesses and sole proprietors, etc.
Letting business "do whatever they want", really doesn't qualify.

Credit card check sums are based on the Luhn code.
Double the odd digits (1, 3, 5, etc.).  Use the sum of any 2-digit results.
Add all these numbers together to end up with one single digit.
Add this single digit to the sums of all the even digits.
The Luhn check digit is the mod 10 of that final subtotal.
For example 641205002340106 yields 4.

I have just read your conditions for releasing the information tha the group felt was necessary to evaluate your product. A couple of comments.
First, the Cypherpunks are not an organized group who can agree to your conditions. This is simply a mailing list not a corporate entity to be contracted with. To attempt to treat them as such and to use their resources for your marketing gain is, in my opinion, less than honest. If the code has not been broken in 5 months, nothing will have been proved. A better model to follow would be that used (eventually) by Netscape. Release the code for comment and make changes based on weaknesses discovered by the group.
you not release the information to Canadians? It cannot be ITAR, because it does not apply to Canadians. How can you claim that the Cypherpunks failed to break your system if you exclude its most brilliant members! .

I am answering the courteous inquiry from Thomas Womack about my request for help with a Visual Basic-only PRNG.  The premise is that those who will not or
can not afford hardware-based RNG's need something relatively secure in the
face of nothing at all or at best a lesser implementation.
I was reluctant to post code at first but rather asked for an interpretation of 10 runs of 9999 characters each.  I want peer review of source code but the threads in CypherPunks have been of a shall we say "low signal to noise" ratio of late.  Even more so than usual.  I just didn't want to feed the beast at this time.
That said, here's the outline of what I'm doing.  A splash screen loads first
displaying a random tip'o'the day about good key management.  I make use of the getcurrenttime() Win API a lot.  Said to have 50 millicent increments.
' Load splash screen first
Sub Form_Load ()
  ' first randomize using number of milliseconds since Windows was launched
  Randomize getcurrenttime()
  ' then rotate the tip'o'the day (30 currently, adding unknown some delay)
  For j = 1 To Int(n * Rnd + 1)
    Select Case j
      Case 1
        hint.Caption = "You passphrase is SUPPOSED to look like gibberish."
      ...
      Case n
        hint.Caption = "Change your passphrases often."
       End Select
  Next j
End Sub
' user clicks an OK button and up comes 2nd screen
Sub Form_Load ()
 ' mix things up
  Randomize getcurrenttime()
End Sub
' main screen's OK button
Sub Command1_Click ()
  Screen.MousePointer = 11
  scramble = ""
  keyLen = Val(keyLength.Text)
  ' repeat for the number of characters in the desired key
  For i = 1 To keyLen
    ' character set is ASCII 33 to ASCII 127
    scramble = scramble & Chr$(Int(94 * Rnd + 33))
    ' reseed
    Randomize getcurrenttime()
    ' now make it wobble to throw off any regularity in the loop
    ' this loop works because as the 7 increases, so does execution time
    For j = 1 To Int(7 * Rnd + 1)
      'idle
    Next j
  Next
  Screen.MousePointer = 0
  secondaryForm.keyLabel.Caption = scramble
End Sub
I'd be happy with an analysis of just how random this is.  My working assumption is that over a >8 character key, it beats trying to dream one up in one's head.  Besides the getcurrenttime API, I don't know what else to sample without an external DLL or hardware.
I started out attempting a keyboard timing routine but had second thoughts.
My software company has been doing bar code printing tools for years. Now we're moving from simple encoding to encryption.
After playing with RSA Secure briefly, I realized that one way to spoof a request to type willy nilly to initialize anything is to use a bar code scanner.  The common type is sometimes called a wedge because you plug your keyboard into it, and it into the keyboard port.  It's wedged between the keyboard and the CPU.
So when asked to type (obstensibly to input randomly timed events) I scan a very large block of bar coded material.  I fill the keyboard buffer at a fixed rate; the throughput of my scanner and PC.  If I scan a large bar code, yes, I'll fill the keyboard buffer as fast as possible.  Little entropy in my eyes.
Oh yeah, with common symbologies like Code 39 and Code 128, I can recreate the whole lower ASCII 128 including tabs, LF/CR, etc.  So I can tab to activate buttons in some UI scenarios. Or do macros any any combination that may include control characters.
So gang, what about bar code scanners being used to thwart random typing Jerry Whiting

At any rate, it's an excuse for me to ask some questions:

Is there any class library support in Java+{Navigator, HotJava, Mosaic, NetCruiser, the AOL web tool, etc.} for applet calls to the local mail agent that's configured in the browser ?  I would prefer not to reimplement SMTP using the Socket class in my own applets. Ideally I'd like to have an applet that presents a form with some entry boxes and check boxes, quantizes and encrypts the input according to the check box settings, and spews the resulting byte streams to the MTA. (1) As I recall, I used to be able to set (as an Option) the path and name of the local MTA (e.g. /usr/lib/sendmail) in an earlier version of Netscape. That seems to have disappeared in Navigator 2.0. Is there indeed no longer a way to set that ?  It occurs to me that we could have achieved partial integration of
remailing into Navigator quite cheaply with that option.
Comments from Sun and/or Netscape and/or anyone else would be welcome.

 hours in order to allow us to clean it.  The cleaning process, which
 eliminates dead email and inactive ftp, www and gopher sites, allows for
 a better-working and faster Internet.
 This year, the cleaning process will take place from 12:01 a.m. GMT on
 Feb. 29 until 12:01 a.m. GMT on March 1.  During that 24-hour period,
 five powerful Internet-crawling robots situated around the world will
 search the Internet and delete any data that they find.
 In order to protect your valuable data from deletion we ask that you do
 the following:
 1.  Disconnect all terminals and local area networks from their Internet
 connections.
 2.  Shut down all Internet servers, or disconnect them from the Internet.
 3.  Disconnect all disks and hardrives from any connections to the
 Internet.
 4.  Refrain from connecting any computer to the Internet in any way.
 We understand the inconvenience that this may cause some Internet users,
 and we apologize.  However, we are certain that any inconveniences will
 be more than made up for by the increased speed and efficiency of the
 Internet, once it has been cleared of electronic flotsam and jetsam.

Pretty much, yep. The only part of this that really annoys me is that there
isn't currently any real place to talk about actual crypto matters from a
user's point of view.
Sure, I can carve out space for myself on my own Web pages to talk about the
things that interest/concern me - and I have - but it's tough to find
anyplace to _learn_ in any way except random experimentation. And sure, if I
could read C well enough to puzzle through the remailer code and had the
UNIX knowledge necessary to compile and run one myself, for instance, I
could answer all my questions about remailer operation. But I don't. And I
wish I didn't have to. Unfortunately, there seems to be a huge gap between
the tiny handful of people who create the stuff and the bulk of us who are
merely interested in using it.
At this point, I acknowledge that I'm reinventing Alan's screed about how
"cypherpunks teach" should be as true as "cypherpunks write code". If more
people don't work on bridging the aforementioned gap, smart people of good
will who happen to be occupied enough with other things not to be able (or

You got my position completely backward on this.  I've always supported Carl's arguments in the past on this issue (for example see the tread "subjective names...").  You may be thinking of what I said about the cost of defeating traffic analysis.

"Assassination Politics" Part 8
The following article appeared in the Sunday, February 4, 1996 issue of Asahi Evening News, in an article written by columnist Paul Maxwell, page 6. He writes a regular column about the Internet for this newspaper.
"Networks:  Paul Maxwell"
"Dial Internet for murder"
'The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers."  (Shakespeare, Henry VI).
A startling and controversial idea has surfaced on the Internet recently--fear with me for a moment while I explain it.  It is based on two technological developments:  digital cash and encryption software.
Briefly, digital cash is a system for transferring funds from one person to another on the Net.  For this system to be as good as cash, the transactions must be capable of being conducted anonymously, just like in real life.  (You go into the Seven-Eleven, buy a Cafe Latte, and nobody knows your name or your credit history.  The purchase is not recorded in a database of your consumer preferences.)
Several competing schemes for digital cash have been launched,  but the one that eventually gains universal acceptance will surely have this anonymity The second innovation is a kind of software called public-key encryption.  It allows you to send a file or an email message that is "locked" in such a way that it can only be opened by the intended recipient.  The recipient, however, cannot open it until given a "key."  This "key" may then be used to encrypt a return message that can only be opened by the original sender.
Freelance visionary and tinkerer Jim Bell has been following both of these developments for the past few years.  Recently, he asked himself a couple of tough questions:  "How can we translate the freedom afforded by the Internet to ordinary life?"  How can we keep government from banning encryption, digital cash, and other systems that will improve our freedom?"
Suddenly, Bell had a revolutionary idea.  ("Revolutionary" is the word he uses, and it fits.)  You and me--the little guys, the ordinary working people of the world--could get together, all pitch in, and pay to have every rotten scoundrel in politics assassinated.  And we could do it legally.  Sort of.
Bell imagined an organization that would award "a cash prize to somebody who correctly 'predicted' the death of one of a list of violators of rights, usually either government employees, officeholders, or appointees.  It could ask for anonymous contributions from the public, and individuals would be able to send those contributions using digital cash."
He explains that "using modern methods of public-key encryption and anonymous digital cash, it would be possible to make such awards in such a way so that nobody knows who is getting awarded the money,  only that the award is being given.  Even the organization itself would have no information that could help the authorities find the person responsible for the prediction, let alone the one who caused the death."
Are you following this?  Let's say that we, the public, decide we've finally had enough of [insert name of villain].  Ten dollars from me, ten from you--suddenly there's a million dollars in a fund.  The money will go to the first person who can "predict" the date, time, and circumstances of the villain's death.  Obviously, this information is only known in advance by the assassin.
He sends an anonymous, "locked" message.  He kills the villain.  He sends the "key" to the message.  He has, without ever revealing his identity,  "correctly predicted" the murder.  The "key" that he has provided is then used to "lock the award money in a file that is then publicly posted on the Internet.  Only the person who originated the key may open the file and claim the digital cash.
In other words, public anger could finance cash awards for assassinations.  The organization that collected the money and announced a list of possible targets would never know about a crime in advance, and would never know the identity or whereabouts of a criminal.  It would not technically be guilty of conspiracy or complicity.
Jim Bell has thought about this a lot, and feels that the idea is technically feasible, practical, even foolproof.  Suppose for a moment he's right?  What are the implications?
World leaders live with the threat of assassination every day of their lives.  But at the local level, this could really have an impact.  And the "target" list wouldn't necessarily to politicians--any offensive public  personality would be fair game.  Picture yourself a year from now, sitting around with friends.   Somebody says, "Remember when Juice Newton got whacked?"   And you say, "Yeah--best ten bucks I ever spent."
Satisfying as it might be to declare war on asinine pop singers, Bell has a more civic-minded suggestion:  Let's kill all the car thieves.  He reasons that a very small number of career criminals are responsible for nearly all car thefts.  If one million car owners in a given metropolitan area contributed just four dollars a year, it would create $10,000 a day in "prize money" for the "predictor" of any car thief's death.
"Assuming that amount is far more than enough to get a typical car thief's 'friends' to 'off' him," he writes, "there is simply no way that a substantial car-theft subculture could possibly be maintained."
Jim as high hopes for his plan--he thinks it could eventually lead to the end of political tyranny.  But if you don't like this idea, he has others.  In a recent email exchange, I asked what he was doing now.
"I recommend that you rent the movie, "The Day the Earth Stood Still.," he answered.  "I'm working on a similar project."

This method is so dependent on the uniformity of the initiator (the cap in this instance) as to be nearly useless.  Normal blasting caps do not detonate with the uniformity required to initiate each of the tube paths at the same time.  In the off chance that you contemplated surrounding the cap with liquid explosive of a sufficent type, (which still wouldn't assure proper uniformity with any certainty as the liquid explosive is as likely to detonate slightly off left to right as up to down) you still have extremely difficult problems to overcome.
1>  Interference from the milling shape and accuracy of the openings to the tubes containing the liquid explosive.
2>  Mild to obscure impurities in the liquid explosives causing differences in velocity with respect to other tubes.  Even small changes in pressures within the tubes might cause enough timing problems to make uniform initiation of the primary high explosive assembly impossible.
3>  Interference from the milling shape and accuracy of the terminus of the tubes containing the liquid explosive.
4>  Overpressure in the device causing premature detonation of the near portion of the high explosive assembly.
All of these might cause enough timing error to prevent uniform pressure and thus prevent uniform compression and make supercriticality impossible.
Remember, kryonic switiches are necessary even when dealing with the speeds of electric conductivity.  The velocities of even hydrazine based explosives are signigicantly lower.  The margin for error is similarly lower.
Plutonium gun is still the easiest method for the home grown nuclear device, even if it requires more fissile material.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ > I wrote this just a few hours ago.  Let's have a vote:  Who thinks I have some idea about the subject?
It's probably a partly practical consideration.  For a given (reasonable) size of wire, it's going to take a certain amount of current to explode it sufficiently rapidly, and that translates into an approximate voltage.  For argument's sake, assume that the voltage necessary is 5000 volts.  (I don't know what the "real" number is...)  Capacitors of 5000 volts are reasonably easily "doable."  However, if you try to hook all those wires together, and if you have a couple of dozen trigger locations, that works out to 125,000 volts total, which is a rather impractically high voltage for "routine" use. (to say nothing of the ability to SWITCH such high voltages).   I suspect that "parts availability" drives nuclear detonators just as it does most more innocuous electronics. 'course, their budgets are a lot higher!
In addition (and this is probably at least as important a reason, if not more so),  if you put multiple wires in series, while the current through them is equal, the voltage across each one may vary.  Thus, the energy put into each wire will also vary, and those where the voltage is higher get more power, and get hotter, and higher resistance, and more voltage, and more power, etc.
In other words, it's an unstable equilibrium, and this would almost certainly lead to a situation where some some triggers happened substantially later than the others.  Putting them all in PARALLEL would avoid this, sorta, but that has its own problems.
A few weeks ago, I downloaded a GIF of the H-bomb, and it shows an element which it referred to as a "shock absorber" (at the appropriate location)and identified the material as graphite.  Graphite is very stiff; a high modulus of elasticity (Young's modulus).  But it isn't very dense.  I would imagine that the velocity of sound in graphite is about as high as you can get in a solid material.  I haven't done any math to determine how effective a match this would be, but maybe it doesn't really matter.
Oh, one more thing.  What the lay person (or even the person who THINKS he "knows it all", as opposed to US, who do.  !) doesn't realize about bomb
design is that the "highest tech" bombs are not the largest, but are in fact the SMALLEST bombs.  Chances are good that a Hiroshima-sized bomb was just about the smallest that was technically do-able in the 1940's.   I would imagine that most of the work that has gone into bomb design in the last 30 years has been the technology to develop smaller (LESS explosive power) bombs,  aside from making them physically small enough to fit in a launch bus.
I forgot about the beryllium.  Beryllium, I understand, is described as a "neutron reflector".   Now how GOOD a neutron reflector it is I don't know, but if you're trying to make a bomb with the smallest amount of material at the primary's core it would help a great deal to have a neutron reflector.  Presumably, it would be used to coat the inside of the "hammer."  If beryllium were a "perfect" neutron reflector, you could use arbitrarily low amounts of plutonium or U-235 as the core (analogy:  If you were in a room with walls which were perfect mirrors, and "you" were invisible, you would see "forever" and the volume of space you were in would appear to be infinite), and you could make the core as small as you want.  (But it isn't, so the improvement effected by beryllium is limited.)
It might also help to make the "pit" hollow, but I don't know about that.  This might assist in the mechanical impedance match, too.  If you could get the chemical implosion timed  "just right" you might be able to get away with using a really THIN layer of plutonium that crashes together at the core.  This might provide optimum densification because you would be able to accelerate the hollow plutonium sphere centrally at near-detonation-velocity speeds, which would result in very effective density increases.
There is also supposed to be a beam trigger in modern bombs.  It ionizes
helium to form alphas, which are fired at beryllium targets which releases neutrons at "just the right time" to start the compacted core going at just the right time.  (More on this if you're interested...)
(BTW, keep in mind as you read what I'm writing that I've never had a nuke-E course, never talked to a bomb maker or anyone who ever talked to one (and probably never talked to anyone who talked to a person who talked to a bomb-maker, etc), have had zero access to classified information of any type (including non-nuclear).   So take what I'm saying with a grain of sodium chloride.  Actually, I'm not particularly interested in bomb design anyway, so I really don't know why I started this thread?!?  That's probably true, but it's still likely to be a very mismatched system.  The density of plutonium is really high.  Now we know why computers were so important in the 1960's and 1970's to bomb design (and still are, I guess!):  Doing a quasi-3 dimensional simulation of the trigger is vastly cheaper than actually exploding a bomb, and you can get far more information from the simulation as well.  Probably the only reason they kept setting off real bombs was to ensure that their mathematics represented reality. (Well, also to test the reliability of "working" warheads...)
BTW, a few years ago I heard about a new explosive material, octanitrocubane.  If you are familiar with chemistry, you'll suspect from the name what it is:  A cube-shaped arrangement of eight carbon atoms, each connected to a nitro (NOT nitrate) group.  It has at least two things going for it:
1.  It is stoichiometric internal to the molecule.
2.  It has ENORMOUS ring strain, which translates into a dramatically greater detonation energy.    It is probably the current record-holder for carbon/nitrogen/hydrogen/oxygen explosives, by a long shot.
Its main disadvantage is predictable, if you know any organic chemistry:  It is an extremely difficult compound to synthesize, or at least to develop the synthesis for.  Thus, it is probably exceedingly expensive.  That means that for "ordinary" use, almost any common explosive is better.  This material is only going to be practical for the "highest-level" usages of explosives, and nuclear detonators are one of these.  Of course, since we're DISMANTLING bombs and not building them (at least as much as we used to!) then new technology to build bombs isn't  particularly useful.  I'm "sure" Los Alamos has probably simulated an octanitrocubane-triggered bomb, for curiosity's sake if nothing else.  The B-28 (?) H-bomb GIF identified this gap as being "vacuum," but we know there is no reason to have an actual vacuum there.  In fact, as I have read, plutonium "pits" get warm to the touch due to radioactive decay.  If it were REALLY put in a "vacuum" it would be so well insulated that it would get EXTREMELY hot before radiative cooling equilibrated the temperature.  Since air is 99.9% of the way to a perfect vacuum compared to a solid, air (in a foam) is plausible, like a harder version of styrofoam.  Plenty of such foams exist today.  And it's possible they augment and stabilize the position by embedding a few relatively thin carbon rods radially between the pit and the hammer.
After a while, things become obvious, don't they?
Even so, and even though my "mechanical engineering" background is weak, I find it hard to believe that modern technology can't provide some sort of "graded impedance" covering that acts like a broadband anti-reflection coating.  (the mechanical equivalent to the covering for the Stealth bomber and fighter plane.)   The main problem would have been simulating such a complex material on a computer, at least in the 1960's.  Something tells me they would have pursued this at least theoretically,  perhaps lacking anything else to do.
The real problem, it seems to me, is that to do this simulation would require a pressure-versus-density curve for plutonium up to nearly a million atmospheres.  This is, of course, hard to test, and that is one reason it would be useful to have deeper atomic physics background.  Perhaps physicists would have been able to estimate such a curve on theoretical grounds.
That's exactly what computer simulation is intended to avoid the need for.  I'm sure instrumentation is a real headache for the testers.
But not for me.  I have no "nuke E" credentials, and don't enjoy programming, and I'm busily working on my "Assassination Politics" debate.  (which, incidentally, will (I believe) force the dismantling of all nuclear weapons in the world, if you've followed the debate, as well as eliminating all wars and militaries and governments.  Tell me, who do you think will win?)
Why put it in sawdust?  The only reason I can think of is to keep it from flowing like a liquid.  Nitromethane is "oxygen-poor" to start out with.
Easily.  And even better, ammonium nitrate is "oxygen rich" so tht you can get efficient use of the nitromethane.  A 2-1 mixture by weight (AN, 2,
nitromethane, 1) is stoichiometric, as I recall.  They are not miscible in all proportions, however, so you'd have to settle for a finely-powdered slurry.
That's why I specified a HOMOGENOUS liquid as the tube-filler.  At least that way you know it's a consistent mix, as opposed to a slurry which would I doubt this.  I'll test it, however, within the next year or so.
That wouldn't be surprising.  TNT is EXTRAORDINARILY 'oxygen-poor.'  It's about as far as you get from being an "efficient" explosive. Hours?  Aw, C'mon!  Minutes!  Maybe even 60 seconds.   The biggest impediment is figuring out how to open the tank, but even that could be avoided by drilling through the wall with a self-sealing "screw" assembly, one that would drain a bit of liquid into a detonator channel...    These tankers are probably usually made either of aluminum or stainless steel, and they could probably be pierced comparatively easily with a screw or a pointed  probe, or even a drill arranged to seal after the flukes had pierced. (Makita's are REALLY useful!) Drilling aluminum is easy; drilling stainless steel's normally a bitch because it work-hardens, but you're not looking for a pretty result so you'd just design with a nicely-sharpened carbide tip (a little work with a masonry bit and a sacrificial grinding wheel will work wonders) and be prepared for anything up to and including tool steel.  The hole would only have to be 1/8" or even smaller (or maybe not even necessary, triggering through the wall is certainly possible, too, but it would require more than a lowly cap.) and you can apply enormous forces to a short drill bit.
I don't think it would be worth it.  If the tanker was full, you'd merely be replacing one fair explosive with another, and it would take a lot of work to grind up the AN and mix it with the contents of the tank.   You'd be wasting time, risking the operation of an anti-highjacking alarm system,  and risking detection and leaving evidence of intent.  Just highjacking the truck, later followed  by a huge explosion, would "leave 'em guessing" about what really happened.
I guess the world is fortunate I'm not into this sorta stuff, huh?!?
Me, I'd do it digitally.  Set up a master 100 MHz clock, for 10 nsec time resolution, feed it to a master counter made up of modern 74ACXXX synchronous counters, then take the count chain and buffer it into a bus connected to a slew of edge-triggered latches, with appropriate amplifiers and  extra circuitry to guard against double-clocking.  You could connect up as many latches as you wanted, fed from various points in a triggered system.  ("fanout limited," but then again, multiple buffering is easy to do, as well.)   "All" the data could be taken in one shot, maybe.  Dozens or even hundreds of locations.
I'd test simultaneity after multiple long lenths of parallel fine tubing, variations in velocity with diameter, effect of curvature, everything.  One "bang" and I'm done.  It would be easy to measure the detonation velocities of the "lens" explosives as well, probably to well under 0.1% accuracy.  (I wonder if nitromethane could act as one of them?!? Would it dissolve or weaken a solid explosive?  Can a solid explosive with a "compatible" detonation velocity be found?)
I only have a fair background in optics, but since the principle of the lensing effect is general it should be easy to figure out what the shape of the lenses would be.  Casting the lenses is probably the technique I'd use, since surprisingly enough most nitrated organic explosives will melt long before they might be inclined to explode.  TNT, for instance, has long been poured as a liquid into artillery shells, melted in steam-jacketed kettles.
At least four molds would be necessary:  Pentagonal and hexagonal versions of the inner and outer explosive.
ed THIN also True, but I suspect that the variation is going to be smaller than is significant, or at least it can be measured and compensated for.  Chances are that "military-grade" accuracies are straightforwardly possible.
BTW, feel free to keep and forward this note to anyone you feel would be interested in this information.  I'd appreciate getting confirmation or corrections, for curiosity's sake if nothing else.

First of all, let me apologize for not being very knowledgable about CA's
and https and SSLeay, apache, and generating renegade (ie, your own)
certificates. If someone wants to go over this [again] certainly it'd be
I was today playing around with a Mozilla 2.0beta5 that someone gave me
[more bells and whistles than my 1.12, but not much more bang for the buck]
and was showing a friend all the nifty information that netscape tells
about you when you visit sites, then went to c2 to show off the apache
web server and when I tried to use https:// to show off how you can have your
own encrypting web server for free and everything, a window popped up and
said the certificate was expired.
I couldn't really tell if it meant that the certificate that Sameer generated
really needed to be updated, or if Netscape beta 5 had just been rigged to
reject non-netscape certificates, but the end result was no encryption.
(Jeff, if you're reading this, of course we know that Netscape, with it's open
loving policies wouldn't do anything underhanded, but the thought does come
to mind, and by the way, when are we going to see an option to turn off or
control what information is passed out to the other end. Specifically, I'd like
 to come up nearly blank.)
Soooo, anyway, I was wondering if anyone knows anything about the use of
privately generated certificates. Yes, Jeff, we know that Netscape is jumping
to fully support user-specified certificates, but personally I saw, relating
to certificates, a lot of *nifty* options and displays, but really didn't
see much in the way of anything that looked like "add".

has a lengthy and evidently well-researched article bylined Richard Behar
on the efforts of BFI, a large regional trash hauler and recycler, to
break into the (by most accounts) Mafia-controlled garbage collection
industry in New York City. Cypherpunk relevance: BFI is cooperating closely with the DA in helping to
prosecute its allegedly mob-affiliated competitors, which raises a lot of
very interesting questions, for which I have yet to formulate any answers.
Also a sidenote about how NYC's disclosure laws actually aid organized
crime by helping the various bosses track who owns what territory. Electronic surveillance. Money laundering. Steganography (sending messages
by way of the disembodied head of a dog). Open access to information and
free-market capitalism versus violent bozos, with and without uniforms.
Pen trumps sword. Rich says check it out.

[suggesting that Alice encrypts 24 bits of key under NSA's public key,
    Bob repeats calculation and checks that the two LEAFS are the same]
No, you're wrong, the process you've described does not work.
Note that RSA normally is used as probabilistic encryption: encrypt the
same plaintext twice, and you'll likely get two different ciphertexts.
Thus, if RSA is used in the normal probabilistic way, the receiver can't
tell whether the sender was compliant.
Now you might suggest that the sender should not include probabilistic
padding, and use RSA deterministically, so that (somehow) the receiver
can check whether those 24 bits are correct.  That again won't work,
since a third-party eavesdropper will be able to do a 2^24 brute force
calculation to recover those 24 bits.
There are complicated ways to prevent a non-compliant copy of Lotus from
inter-operating with a compliant copy (as others on cypherpunks have kindly
pointed out), but they are complicated, and would require a re-design of
Lotus Notes' encryption module.  Since the export version is interoperable
with the non-export version, this would seem to require too much foresight
and work to be very likely.
In any event, I've heard that the export version of Lotus Notes 4 always
sends a LEAF, but the receiver never checks it.  So I think a simple binary
patch to change the NSA's public key should work.
P.S.  So does anyone know how large the NSA's public LEAF key is?

Russ, since you weren't present at the workshop I'll repeat the very first
words I said in the presentation I gave there.
Functionally, from a user's perspective, there is for all practical
purposes no difference between any of these technologies.  Today I would
add that we could pick one out of hat and just move on.
However, there are differences in the technologies.  Some are easier to
implement, some are more flexible, some perform better, and the list goes
on.  We need to explore those differences to develop a criteria for
evaluating the technologies so we can provide the best possible solution to
the user community.  I proposed one possible criteria in my presentation,
by no means the only one and by no means complete.

I asked one of the NorTel sales reps. about this at the RSA conference. As
I recall, CAST is an espionage-enabled version of DES -- i.e. 16 of the key
bits are sent in the clear, or have a fixed value, or something along those
lines. The guy I spoke to didn't know the technical details.
Of course, maybe we should consider 56-bit DES espionage-enabled at this point too !

Mail*Link(r) SMTP               FWD> ADMIRAL WILLIAM O. STUDEMAN
Gee I guess we can trust these guys....
    CONCORD, Calif., Feb. 28 /PRNewswire/ -- Premenos Technology Corp.
(Nasdaq: PRMO), a leading provider of electronic data interchange (EDI)
software solutions for electronic commerce applications, today announced
the election of Admiral William O. Studeman, U.S. Navy-retired, to its
Board of Directors effective immediately. Studeman will also act as
consultant on special projects including security and encryption issues.
          Admiral Studeman, age 56, is the former Deputy Director of Central
Intelligence and served for five months in 1995 as the acting Director
of Central Intelligence. He retired from the Navy in October 1995. Prior
to his assignment at the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Studeman was
the Director of the National Security Agency (NSA), and before that was
the Director of Naval Intelligence. In these positions, Studeman was
involved in attempting to develop public policies and technologies that
addressed the complex and often conflicting issues of enhanced economic
competitiveness, law enforcement's warranted requirement for information
transparency in pursuit of criminal investigations, national security
interest in combating potential information warfare threats, and the
country's overall increased need for enhanced protection of its
information-related systems and applications.
          In commenting on his election to the Board of Premenos, Studeman
stated that "Premenos is not only a leader in facilitating the promising
future of electronic commerce, it is the first company in the
marketplace with a product line for enhanced protection, security and
integrity for the Internet and other electronic communications-related
business transactions." Studeman added, "In working with Lew Jenkins and
others in the company, I have an opportunity to better frame the
government-industry dialogue and define the infrastructure, standards,
regulatory, technical and other directional factors which must be
addressed for electronic commerce -- a rapidly evolving industry segment
so fundamental to the future of the American lifestyle and national
          Lew Jenkins, chairman and founder of Premenos said, "The
infrastructure for moving critical business data over the Internet is
crucial to the success of electronic commerce. We welcome Admiral
Studeman to our team and look forward to his help in developing a
trusted model for the electronic commerce market and establishing a
solid infrastructure similar to the stringent military requirements that
have been in place for decades."

The database size is really only half the problem I think.  The bigger
problem is managing the database.  I can't quite see it being possible to
have one organization serve as a distribution point for all keys. With
millions of billions of certs, you're going to have having thousands or
millions of database updates on a daily basis.
It does seem though that if you can truly eliminate revocations then things
get a lot easier.  You never have to go back a check with the issuer about
anything. This will probably work for some applications, but there's
certainly others for which it won't.

      The commission finds that the patchwork of 14 separate
      intelligence agencies is functioning well in its current
      form. To meet tbe growing threat of worldwide criminal
      activity the panel suggested creation of a high-level

      Global Crime Committee. It would be chaired by the
      president's national security adviser and would include
      the AG, State, DoD, and the DCI.

      CIA's covert operators do not want to reopen the debate.
      As Turner put it, "Is the media case stronger than
      businessmen or academics? The covert operators are
      worried that we may reach a point where prohibitions
      will get us down to where there is nobody left to spy
      but the Foreign Service."

   "Commission Recommends Streamlined Spy Agencies."
      Most of the changes the report will recommend are
      evolutionary, not revolutionary. Intelligence officials
      used the same word to describe it: "underwhelming." The
      report fails to answer the big overstaffing problem. An
      official said the resistance within the intelligence
      agencies to staff cutting would be so strong that the
      downsizing would never happen.

I think we are in violent agreement here...
Perhaps you misunderstood what I mean by "central keyserver model".
What I mean by that is the status quo, where we have a set of central
keyservers and each keyserver knows about each key.  When I say that
this will disappear, I mean that we will move towards a more
distributed system, similar to the DNS for looking up hostnames.  Yes,
we will need a distributed, hierarchial [sic] system in the future,
and if we want to continue using PGP we will need to provide a simpler
way to use that.
This is true.
I disagree.  I know the addresses of the people with whom I
communicate regularly.  I know my parent's USnail address, my
grandparents', my SO's, etc.  I dont need to tell the Post Office
"Send this to my parents" and trust them to do it.  I give them a
destination address and trust them to send it to the proper
destination.  The same thing is true in the electronic world.  I put a
destination on the email, give it to the mailer, and trust it to send
it to the appropriate destination.
A similar anology can be made when I dont know an address: I ask
someone for it.  Same thing with an email address/PGP key, I need to
ask for it before I can use it.
The same thing is true of hostnames.  I can find a hostname<->IP
address for just about any host on the planet.  Do I have them all on
my local disk?  No, of course not.  I look them up when I need them.
However, I do cache local copies of the names I frequently use.
Yes, this is true.  And it is used -- its called regional phone books.
If I want to get a number for someone, I go to the regional phone book
and look them up.  I have to know something about them first, so I
know where to look.  If I asked you to find the machine
"incommunicado" and tell me it's IP address, what would you do?  You'd
have to look in every domain for machines named "incommunicado".
However, if you knew that I meant "in the 'ihtfp.org' domain", you'd
know exactly where to look.  The same is true of phone numbers.  The
same is true for keys.
True.  The problem is that with PGP messages, the only information
about keys is a "random" keyID.  From a keyID there is no way to
determine that key unless you already have it.  This means that if you
do not already have the key, you have no way to find that key.  See
the problem?  This is like the "find 'incommunicado'" problem above.
What I propose is to modify, slightly, the PGP signature certificate
to add a "hint" field.  This hint field would tell you where to look
for the key.  This is the way to add the "ihtfp.org" info to the
PGP signature.
I hope this clears up any misconceptions...

While that would be useful in a lot of cases, I would hope that
all that path gunk wouldn't be required.... most people would
have one key, at least initially, and so a simple
would be enough for them.  I wouldn't want to prevent people
from using your system, in fact it's a good idea.  I just don't think
that it should be required, just recommended.
Something else to add would be a specifier for the type of key, i.e.
The reason for the keytype specifier is obvious, so that the
system can support more than just PGP keys.  The problem with
the above example is that the 'pgp' part is imbedded in the path.
Since the apps that read these key URLS need to know which ones
are for PGP and which for DH or DSS or whatever, the keytype
specifier needs to be in a standard location in the URL.
Suggestions?  maybe key:/pgp/slack.lne.com/ericm/key/asc?
Finally, a question:  should the keyserver be able to serve
keys in a way that is secure from a MITM attack, or can it depend
on the certificate chain in the key certificate itself to
validate the key certificate?  I think it can, but I am not
sure, so perhaps someone smarter than I can explain why, or why not.
The attraction is obvious, if the key server doesn't have to
validate the keys it serves, the whole problem of distributed
key servers becomes much easier.

Financial Times, March 6, 1996, IT Section, p. V.    Network Security: Operating under a cloud of uncertainty       Companies face a complex web of technical, legal and       moral questions    The IT security threat has long been depicted in terms of    wild-eyed hackers hunched over terminals late into the    night. But while there is real cause for concern about    criminal activity over computer networks, large    corporations are very worried about another threat to their    use of electronic communications.    Meanwhile, government restrictions on the use of data    encryption codes in various countries are limiting the    ability of commercial organisations to protect themselves.    Cryptography is at the heart of this dilemma. Governments    all over the world rely on specialist intelligence units to    break down data transmissions from other nations and    individuals while encrypting their own messages.    The US National Security Agency and the UK's Government    Communications HQ are the best-known of these agencies.    The NSA is notorious for obsessive secrecy. Meanwhile, in    the UK, the GCHQ has lifted its traditional reticence in    recent years to offer advice to British companies concerned    with data security.    Mr Roger James, chairman of Cheshire-based communications    software specialist Boldon James, has worked with GCHQ to    define data standards for UK government departments. Mr    James plays down the cloak-and-dagger imagine of GCHQ, but    instead he describes his contact with its staff as    "horribly technical". He also portrays the Cheltenham    code-breakers as "very down-to-earth people".    There are two ways of looking at security, he says "one is    the practical approach, which means accepting that perfect    security is impossible to obtain. The other is the Ivory    Tower approach, which involves dreaming of a world in which    security is absolute. There are a lot of 'practicalists' in    GCHQ".    Mr James, whose clients include the Britannia Building    Society and the German Navy, is active in the European    Electronic Messaging Association. He is concerned at the    lack of a co-ordinated European policy on encryption. And    he fears that effective security measures could become    illegal with the advent of future legislation curbing the    availability of encryption software.    It is illegal at the moment to use strong cryptography    techniques in France without first depositing the key to    unlocking your codes with the French government. UK    companies developing sophisticated security programs find    their software classified as munitions and subject to tight    export restrictions, even within the EC.    In the US, the author of strong encryption program, called    'Pretty Good Privacy', found himself facing a Grand Jury    and possible charges of exporting prohibited technology.    The NSA has proposed that all personal computers made in    the US contain the Clipper Chip. This security feature    would give easy access to any data communications, however    the user chose to encode it. The proposal is currently    stalled, having met with ferocious opposition.    Both suppliers of information technology and industry at    large need to clear a path through this international maze.    The legal structure surrounding the use of encryption    technology is of particular concern to anyone working in    electronic commerce.    "The Clipper Chip debate raised a fundamental moral issue,"    says Mr James. "Software technology means that strong    encryption, previously available only to the military, can    now be obtained by the public. If governments then find    messages hard to break, it leads immediately to a conflict    of interest."    One company that has confronted this apparent conflict of    interest between state and commerce, with its attendant    uncertainty, is the Anglo-Dutch oil giant, Shell. Mr Nick    Mansfield, a Shell technical consultant specialising in    information security, says the company is enthusiastic    about the potential for eliminating paperwork across its    sprawling global operations -- "we are committed to    electronic trading," he says. "We have a vast    electronic-mail network. But there is still a section of    our business where we have to use paper".    Contract agreements are at issue here. Until security can    be absolutely guaranteed, bilateral agreements must be seen    to be tamper-proofed. Shell is about to deploy technology    to secure personal computers and PC servers across the    world. This e-mail security system will cost around L1m in    software purchasing plus L100,000 a year to run. It will    have 4,000 users.    Far from escalating costs, Mr Mansfield explains that    expenses are falling as security improves. Shell used to    run a secure telex network that cost L4m in technology and    required L200,000 a year to support 120 sites. This was    superseded by a secure fax network costing L1m in systems,    plus L100,000 in annual maintenance for 200 sites. The    latest system will expand secure messaging beyond the fax    network's remit.    But setting up this security system involved Shell in a    long and involved process. Its chosen security software is    subject to close scrutiny by the UK authorities, who worked    with Shell to customise the program before it could be    released for use overseas.    While Mr Mansfield is pleased that Shell's security system    is so strong, it required an export licence and he echoes    the concerns of EEMA's Mr James -- "it's a cart and horse    situation. Until governments agree on policy and relax some    restrictions, industry won't be encouraged to development    extreme standards of encryption".    There needs to be a broad European debate on this issue.    Until this complex web of technical, legal and moral    questions are resolved, secure commercial data networks    will be operating under a cloud of uncertainty.    Michael Dempsey    [End]    Note: Shell's Nick Mansfield was a speaker at the OECD    cryptography conference in Paris in December.

The Leahy bill is actually much better than Stanton lets on.  Take a
look at it, it affirms Americans' right to choose whatever algorithm or
technique they'd like, as well as takes great pains to go on record to
say that Congress treaded very carefully to preserve Americans' right
to not use key escrow algorithms, and if they did, not to use escrow
agents.  You don't get much more of a guarantee than that.
Regardless of the ulterior motives of the White House, key escrow
programs are still voluntary as read on the books.  The best we can
write into a law is to have our rights reaffirmed.  Leahy has given
this to us in spades.
Let's not soft-pedal this legislation.  Leahy and Goodlatte are going
head to head with the White House to undermine the strongarm export
tactics of Clipper and Son of Clipper.  They've stuck their necks out for
us, we need to back them up.
Just wait until the White House starts to act in reaction to this.  It's
not going to be pretty....

Sure you do: Goodlatte's more direct prohibition on the Exec. branch mandating Key Escrow.  What's the problem here?  We know Goodlatte's version, on this provision at very least, is better. Why can't we just agree that it is, and support that?  Goodlatte's bill isn't competing with Leahy's, they were introduced simultaneously in different chambers, and are intended to get the same message across. I can't see a problem with saying "we like this particular phrasing better, let's have it in both versions."  The entire point of all this is to have the same bill on both sides of Congress anyway.  It can either happen early, or (on the off chance it ever gets that far) in conference committee. Here we have a large say. In conf. cmte. we have almost no say.  Again, what's the problem?
What are we arguing about?
I disagree.  A better thing we can write into law is to simultanously have rights reaffirmed, and send a more direct message to the Admin that it cannot tread here.
Let's not hard sell flawed parts of it, when fixes are not just available but already introduced as "live" legislation.
No kidding.
I expect either an attempt to mandate escrow, a worsening of the export controls, and/or an all-out assault on American's rights to encrypt at all, or without some kind of worse-than-GAK registry or licensing.  If not all of the above.

I won't repost the entire article here, but here are some highlights:
  - The system is initially intended to secure email between federal
    government employees.  Deployment is expected to begin next year.
  - Key management is decentralized; each department hands out its own keys.
  - Top-secret messages will be encoded using "palm-sized computer cards"
    (presumably some kind of PCMCIA device).
  - The Communications Security Establishment (~= NSA) helped to design
    the system, and claims that it's "more sophisticated than existing
    public versions".
    (This is the part that still worries me a bit, even though EFC's
    David Jones is quoted as saying that he has no concerns.  Will the
    algorithms be published?  Also, why develop a new, untested system --
    why not just buy the thing from RSA, Viacrypt, etc.?  Stay tuned...)
  - There's a great quote from Bob Little, deputy secretary of financial
    and information management for the Treasury Board:  "[The CSE] don't
    have access to the keys . . . and never will.  We did it to avoid
    the American experience with the Clipper Chip."
  - The RCMP (~= FBI) is not amused.
All in all, it sounds like a positive development for once.

That's all this guy said.
Here's my more verbose response.
You are _entitled_ to not "agree" with me.  What you are NOT entitled to, however, is to have a government that violates my rights by attempting to restrict crypto and other freedoms, even if it is with the support of 51% of the Congress or 51% of the voters or 51% of the population.  (or even substantially more.)  If you actively support such a government, or even encourage such a government, you are doing what is analogous to "inciting a riot":  You are guilty of inciting the government to take improper, illegal, unconstitutional, or simply immoral actions against me and others, and in my opinion if such actions are taken you enter into that conspiracy.
You may be alarmed that I might consider you a criminal for just exercising your "free speech."  (If you're not alarmed, you SHOULD be!)  I myself would greatly prefer to live in a society where speech was totally free:  There would be no laws against libel and slander, and you could "yell 'fire' in a crowded theatre" without the possibility of prosecution.  (All the other potential customers will be home watching on tape rental, which will make what you can do in a theatre less significant.)
But until we live in such a world, I consider that yelling "child porn!" or "terrorism!" or "drug smuggling" in "a crowded Congress" or _to_ "a crowded Congress" that's anxious to restrict our rights ever further, is an incitement to violate my rights.
No, I don't think you do.  You've done NOTHING to actually _support_ my right to disagree, except possibly waste a few bytes of information space on a message that you did not see fit to publicize.  (I did, however.)  Clearly, your "support" for my "right to disagree" is essentially non-existent.

I don't think this is definitional.  If nothing else they can take the equipment.  If you don't incorporate, your personal assets are at risk; if you do, you have to keep a real separation between the corporation and yourself, pay the taxes, etc.  Ok, make it a non-profit labor of love; low risks, no returns, then maybe you are right.

I wonder whether they've actually considered the liability situation

It seems that once again, big business is trying to get in the way of
progress and competition because they are afriad they are going to lose
some money.  It seems to me that the ACTA is upset because someone found a
way to "do it cheaper" and the telco's stand to lose a lot of long distance
dollars.  So rather then using this technology and perhaps lowering LD
rates, instead they seek to block out the technology from the public.  I
wonder what would happen if someone discovered an drastically cheaper
alternative to gasoline, but it never made it main stream because the oil
companies would go out of business.  Seems like the same type of situation
with the telco's.
No, the technology is surpassing the telco's ability to provide low-cost
Permissible communications?  This sounds like something out of the CDA ...

Since someone other than Jim Bell and THE LIST OF SHAME author thought I
was being serious, I thought it wise to respond.
The notion that a measure of criticism from a known enemy, Dorothy
Denning, corrects the many problems with Leahy's legislation is absurd.
As a case in point, remember that Rush Limbaugh, Catharine MacKinnon,
and the radical religious right group American Family Association
criticized the CDA. That does not make the CDA worth passing.
(Of course Rush likes dirtysexycybertalk so he can pick up chicks
online, and the AFA wanted not less, but _more_ liability for ISPs, but
I trust my point is clear.)
Speaking of the CDA, I'll be in Philadelphia tomorrow and Friday for the
hearing. Any other cypherpunks planning to attend?

why people go anonymous while supporting their right to do so. Sometimes
anonymity is necessary, sometimes it's just for fun, sometimes its
cowardice, sometimes it's deception. Your point about "stop whining and write code for anonymous reputations"
is misplaced.  Such code ALREADY EXISTS. There are lots of nyms out there
with PGP keys. If you're already PGP-encrypting your message to send it
to an anonymous remailer securely, it's really no more trouble to sign it

AO on MS response to Java:
I think this is a very good example of why nobody should bemoan Java.
when it was first introduced I heard a lot of grouching and sniping
at this really outstanding software (that was admittedly overhyped).
but look what we could have gotten as the first potential standard:
the above system.
MS was apparently caught completely off guard with Java. they had not a clue about what it was about, why it was important, and scrambled to deal with it.
they have apparently only reluctantly licensed it as a temporary ploy.
the above motions suggest they ultimately want to control this standard.
all the MS responses to Java outside of licensing it appear to me to
be pathetically missing the point. they don't seem to understand why
Java is so important, namely its decentralized security model you refer to. you cannot create this by adding a few function calls on
top of an already insecure language like Visual Basic.
it has to be done incredibly carefully from the ground up as it was
done with Java. I don't think people realize how carefully this language
was constructed, it was developed extremely delicately in a way unlike
many other languages. this is a real breakthrough in software that theoretically creates a "secure" programming environment, something that has been sought for decades and is now being delivered to the desktop due
to some very hard work and visionary effort.
I noticed that Denning, in her Leahy protest letter, referred to glowingly of this MS "endorsement" scheme. I have
a very bad suspicion that MS is like a dog that rolls over whenever
the NSA comes to visit them and tell them how to write their software
(apparently this happens routinely).
anyway, I totally agree with you that their centralized scheme is
really horrible, and its inferiority and headaches are likely to
be spotted and yowled about by many developers as you write.
 there is no probably no need to fear MS's schemes at the moment. as long
as they have an inferior standard its not going to gain much attention
or use and Java already has a very intense momentum going. just because
MS does something in some area is not necessarily reason to take them
seriously. they have had situations where they come out with stuff
that never turns into anything and silently evaporates like all companies have. (far less than others, but nonetheless)
one thing I just don't really understand about MS is their seeming
drive to conquer every market. it seems that whenever a new software
market emerges they feel they have to invade it and dominate it
like pirates. this has a lot to do with the psychology of Bill Gates.
the idea that "gosh, somebody else has already done that really well,
and it would be awfully tought to beat them, let's not bother with
that" seems to be lost in that environment completely. instead, it
is, "oh no!! they are beating us!! we have to make a better widget
or we'll all die!!" -- a good example of competition taken to extremely unhealthy extremes imho. I suspect like others that MS'
glory days are receding and in fact all extremely large companies
may undergo major shifts once our economy fully shifts into the
information age.

(All perfectly legal according to the DDK, just ot documented worth a damn.)  All of this is designed to work directly with the functionality given to us by the NT-Security layer.
Basically, I'm now questioning the C2 rating of Windows NT.  The entire security layer is  modular to the Kernel.  As a modular driver, it can be removed, rewritten, and replaced.   So, what makes it secure?  What gives it the C2 Rating?  How would one go about getting a C2 rating?

News from the ACLU National Headquarters
                 ACLU V. RENO:  Background Briefing
              Three-Judge Panel to Hear ACLU Testimony in            Landmark Challenge to Internet Censorship Law
PHILADELPHIA, PA--Beginning tomorrow, a three-judge panel in
federal district court in Philadelphia will hear testimony in the
consolidated cases of ACLU et al v. Reno and American Library
Association et al v. Reno, the landmark challenge to censorship
provisions of the Telecommunications Law of 1996. Free speech in cyberspace is at stake as the first major legal
challenge to censorship on the Internet gets underway.  The case began
when the ACLU filed a motion for a temporary restraining order against
indecency provisions of the Telecommunications Bill immediately after
it was signed into law by President Clinton on February 8.  The suit
challenges provisions of the law that criminalize making available to
minors "indecent" or "patently offensive" speech.  Acting on behalf of 20 individuals and organizations that provide
information via the Internet -- including itself -- the ACLU said it
was moving quickly because it feared that the telecommunications
legislation would have an immediate impact on the Internet.  Following this action, a second legal challenge was filed on
February 26 by a coalition of more than 20 corporate and trade
organizations known as the Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition
(CIEC).  The CIEC suit, organized by the American Library Association,
America Online and the Center for Democracy and Technology, was
formally consolidated  with ACLU v. Reno.  The CIEC lawsuit, which addresses essentially the same issues as
the ACLU challenge, further illustrates the broad spectrum  of
individuals and organizations that would be affected by the censorship
provisions, and strengthens the case for a finding that the law is
unconstitutional.  The Court Case According to procedures laid out by the judges, direct testimony
in ACLU v. Reno is to be submitted via affidavit.  During the three
days of testimony allowed, which will take place over March 21 and 22
and April 1, lawyers for the Department of Justice will cross-examine
coalition witnesses, after which lawyers for the ACLU and ALA
coalitions will have an opportunity to redirect, i.e., question their
witnesses in response to the government's cross-examination.
In preparation for the case, lawyers for the Department of Justice
have been deposing all the ACLU and CIEC witnesses it may choose to
cross-examine.  So far, government lawyers have declined to cross-
examine only two witnesses: Christine Soto and Hunter Allen, teenagers
whose affidavits attest to the importance of uncensored access to the
Internet by minors.  The government is scheduled to present its witnesses for cross-
examination on April 11 and 12, 1996.  A fourth day of testimony has
been scheduled for April 26, to allow the ACLU and ALA coalitions to
present witnesses rebutting the government's testimony.   Following
these six days of trial,  the judges will issue a ruling.  Depending
on the outcome, either side may seek an appeal to the U.S. Supreme
Court.   The Witnesses

Tim Fulbright <100022.3167 at compuserve.com>
there  seems to be a lot of hyperventilating in the military arena
about "information warfare" lately. I find it rather strange and incomprehensible. there are two chief areas that this frenzy seems
to be in response to:
1. propaganda/espionage areas.
2. hacking. (i.e. breaking in, crashing, etc.)
as for (1), I don't know what the fuss is about. what it suggests to
me is that there are branches of government that take "psyops" (psychological
operations) extremely seriously and are very intent on setting up camp
in cyberspace & the internet, and have probably already done so.
it is as if they are deathly terrified of the ability of individuals
to communicate not only with other individuals but other masses through
web pages and email. I find it quite frightening how many people in
our government have the mindset that "free communication can be a very
dangerous thing." personally I think an application for government
should reject anyone that hasn't memorized the entire bill of rights..
but the recent Strassman & Marlow paper on remailers, which addressed (1),
seemed a bit incomprehensible and bordered on unintelligible.
they talked as if remailers are like weapons that can be fired on
an enemy. (huh???)  either they are deep into psyop or spook psychology, or they just don't "get it" that remailers are pretty harmless. I tend to believe it is a little of both.
(2) is definitely something to take very seriously. if you want to
learn about how/why infiltrating computers is incredibly appealing
to many in the government, check out info on "danny casolaro" and
Inslaw PROMIS software.
the behind-the-scenes theme to a lot of this is that our massive
cold war apparatus is bored and listless now that the Soviet bogeyman
is gone and they are just moving into new territories to continue
to suck up billions of dollars.
but its awfully hard to read the various scrambled entrails that have
been emerging such as the Leahy bill, Strassman & Marlow paper, etc. in
relation to info warfare-- I tend to think some of it is just evidence that there are some amazingly addled people in our government.
BTW I like "boardwatch" mag, read it regularly, and highly recommend it to anyone as one of the better & more quality cyberspace mags. try

At 12:05 PM 3/20/96, Perry E. Metzger is rumored to have typed:
What amuses me most about this series of rantings by whomever, other
than the paranoid and baseless claims made by the anonymous poster,
is the number of people who have been complaining about the author doing
so anonymously through a remailer.  The irony of such a situation is
too rich to pass up.
It seems that cypherpunks can dish it out when other newsgroups and
mailing lists suffer such problems ("well, the remailers do nothing
that telneting to port 25 cannot do..." or "internet identity is such
a fiction anyway, get used to it"  seem to be common responses), but
when the cypherpunks lists is the victim of unpleasant anonymous messages
we fall back to the tired refrain of "if you have nothing to hide why
are you posting anonymously."  How sad.
So, why the hypocrisy here?  If you don't want to be bothered by these
messages there is a simple solution, use a mail agent that can filter
out remailer postings and trash them.  Of course this would also kill
interesting messages from others who use remailers, but that's the price
we pay for having remailers that do not support anonymous identity upon
which reputation can be built.
Oh yeah, I forgot...cypherpunks write code (snicker).  So why not stop
bitching and write a bit of code that provides for useful anonymous
reputations and/or fix the glaringly obvious problems with current
jim, who is sorry that he is not the one posting such trolls to the list
just to make the puppets dance...

I mean, its obvious that, whatever its flaws, passage of the Leahy

As our statement on the bill made clear, *EFF does not support the Leahy bill*, nor do we endorse it, like it, find it useful or any other synonym.
We're happy to see the issues raise again, a la Cantwell, but we specifically recommended simple and complete deregulation. As our co-founder John Gilmore points out, the Leahy bill as written pre-supposes Congressional authority to legislate in this are, and Executive authority to regulate under that legislation. These are notions that we, and Phil Karn, are challenging in court with Constitutional tests we are throwing at the ITAR export regs.

You used to claim "our system is absolutely safe, we're sure of it, but we
can't tell you the algorithm cause it's secret."  People said that was
stupid, so you finally agreed to show people the algorithm (apparently
sending it to them unsolicited, and then expecting them to be bound to some
sort of non-disclosure agreement?  You might want to hire a lawyer to
familiarize you with how trade secrets work legally, cause they don't work
like you think they work).  The people you showed the algorithm to pointed
out flaws in it.
Now you say "Yeah, okay so there were flaws, but we'll fix them and then it
will be perfect, except you can't see the code or algorithm cause it's
secret."  Sounds like we're back where we started, eh?   No one was willing
to trust the algorithm before without it being reviewed publically.  No one
will be willing to trust it now either, _especially_ after the previous
concerns that the algorithm wasn't secure were _confirmed_.
The cypherpunks list doesn't have to provide free cryptanalysis to you.  I
doubt anyone will want to waste their time looking at  future iterations of
your algorithm, if you deign to show it to them.  The fact that people on
the cypherpunks list don't want to waste their time doing free
cryptanalysis for you doesn't mean that your code is secure, or endorsed by
anyone.  It means that even those who may have thought it possible that
your algorithm was secure after all have given up on that thought, or at
least decided that it's unlikely enough not to be worth much further
consideration, at least until you start behaving reasonably.

I'd say that anything directly dealing with digital cash, its
implications, deployment, and technical issues associated with
it. General discussions of whether the Federal Reserve is a bunch of
evil old men and the like are what are out of bounds.
This means:
"How does blinding work"
and "Do you think that digital cash systems will hurt bank regulatory
are fine things to talk about but
"Do you think the Federal Reserve issues counterfeit money"
are not.

[Excellent points about gold's practical use, good timing, and industrial value countered by the current lack of industrial value.]
I was with you until this.  In fact diamonds are anything but rare.  Their value is the result of the most exceptional marketing by DeBeers, and the very tight restrictions on supply.  I might note that the restrictions on supply are even somewhat tangential.  DeBeers has created one of the most historic, long standing and impressive market distortions anyone has ever seen.
Of course this only goes to further the argument (which I think you are adopting) that it is fairly simple to estlablish a commodity of "value" regardless of intrinsic worth)
Even gem quality stones are relatively abundant believe it or not.
Again, even absent the intrinsic value of the substance it seems that marketing and perception will dictate "effective value."
This is precisely the point, and why, while I agree with your comments about gold today, I think the most important issue is the long term solvency of a commodity.  As you have noted, anyone can make a substance worth something in the short term.  (Tulips)  The challenge, and the goal in my view, is to create a currency based on a backing which endures the long term, and the unthinkable (collapse of a major government or some such).
When the value of the intrinsic worth of a commodity in question does become apparent is in periods of transition, flux, disorder, or strife.  The security of a currency is going to be a major factor, especially immediately following introduction, to its popularity- except in unusual circumstances (tulips, market distortions, etc.)
I'm not sure this is precisely true.  While gold itself might not be the best choice, the general principal that a commodity based currency is less secure or trustworthy than a government backed one (even a powerful and imposing government) is not one I'm prepared to endorse without I believe this correct.
Just like diamonds.
Again, while the commodity itself (gold) may not be appropriate, I don't believe this ends the argument.
Which suggests that private currencys must utilize e-cash (if at all) merely as monetary instruments which continue to look much like what exists today.  (e.g., drafts, checks, bonds...)
I concur.
I concur again.
Yet here I must differ.  I'm still not convinced that a legitimate commodity somewhat resistant to the market distortions you cite does not exist.  Don't ask me what it is yet, I'll have to give it some thought.

Does anyone have ANY code for DES or RSA encryption for use on a PIC
microcontroler?  A friend and I are developing an ASCII terminal (dumb term)
that encrypts data going to the serial port and decrypts data coming from
the serial port, so you could successfully send a message over a modem and
have it automatically encrypted\decrypted.  We have all the hardware almost
done, but we are having a hell of a time writing the code for the encryption...

Here is an abstract of a report the German newsmagazine Focus
published on March 11, 1996 (p. 16) - "Spaete Ermittlungen gegen
Techno-Spione" (late/belated investigations against technology
spies). I do not include a translation of the whole original text
for copyright reasons.
"Specialists of the German Federal Police Agency (BKA) have decrypted
44 floppy disks from the former [East German] Ministry for State
Security" (MfS). A defector had handed over the floppies to the
German Federal Intelligence Agency (BND) in spring 1990. The disks
contain information on East German spies in former West Germany.
Judicial inquiries against 29 suspects have started now. Apparently,
the BKA got the data no sooner than 1994. This is because the BND did
not tell law authorities about the floppy disks. German federal DAs
learned about the data in late summer 1994 by chance. The article
does not say whether the defector came over with the keys. - Probably not, otherwise prosecution should have started much earlier. It is likely that the extremely paranoic MfS used a cipher and a key
length it believed to be sufficiently strong. According to Bruce
Schneier's Applied Cryptography East Germany was quite aware of DES,
it even produced DES chips. Another possibly strong algorithm used in
the former Soviet block is GOST (a block cipher derived from the
concepts of DES, also described by Schneier). Let us assume BKA
specialists have broken the code using a combination of
cryptoanalysis, brute force and good luck. They are policemen, not
espionage professionals. Further, the BKA is much smaller than the
FBI. Imagine what code breaking capabilities a well-funded, big
intelligence agency should have then!

You don't.  Blind signatures only work with "pure" RSA.  You cannot
use PKCS encoding to perform blind signatures.  PKCS nullifies the
multiplicity that is required for these blinding techniques to work.

I have some stupid question about how to implement blind signature.
I Know it works as follows:
If A wants B to sign X but donot know it is X, A can send
   X*PK(random)  : PK is public key of B
Then B signs on message:
  SK(X*PK(random)) ==> SK(X)*random
Then A can obtain SK(X) by SK(X)*random/random
My question is when I see how RSA encrypts using PKCS
The PKCS block is like this
 00 01 FF FF FF FF ... 00 input
Then SK(00 01 FF FF FF .. 00 input) .
If the input = X*PK(random)
then SK(00 01 FF FF FF .. 00 X*PK(random)) will not produce SK(X)*random
How to solve this??

@_subject: Another Anti-Privacy Bigot Heard From (was: The Guilmette/Burnore deba 
That won't work for two reasons:  First, Gary is now "cloaking" his
posts with an "X-No-Archive" header to keep them from being archived
by neutral parties such as DejaNews.  In addition, if you do a
search on his name as author in the old database, you get a bunch of
matches that say "article not available", indicating that he's
requested that such articles be removed from the archives.  Second,
how does one search for something that was never posted?  The only
thing I see in the Deja News archives is Jeff Burchell's explanation
of Burnore's $cientology-esque attack on his remailer:
-> Subject:    Re: DataBasix vs. the Remailers -- Gary Burnore's ->             Dirty Tricks Exposed (was: Jeff's Side of the Story.)
-> From:       toxic at hotwired.com (Jeff Burchell)
-> Date:       1997/07/02
-> Message-ID: <5pc9mb$omg$1 at re.hotwired.com>
-> -> [...]
-> -> : > Mr. Burnore requested a copy of my (non-existant) logs.
-> : > I told him to get me something in writing, signed by his lawyer that
-> : > stipulated that the logs were confidential, and not to be revealed to
-> : > anyone outside of the lawyer's office.
-> :
-> : He requested the logs of the messages of *EVERYONE* using Huge
-> : Cajones?  What was his rationale for such a fishing expedition?
-> : (Cases like this are a good reason for remailers to NOT keep logs.)
-> -> I have no idea of his rationale.  And I don't know of any remailer
-> operator who keeps logs that would identify a user.  I had my machine
-> configured to log in a fairly standard way, but I used a different
-> sendmail configuration for the remailer, that had all logging (except
-> for certain error conditions) turned off.
-> -> Part of me thinks he wanted the logs so he could tell if I was going
-> to be able to identify him when he started his attacks.
Thus far, that's the best explanation I've seen for Gary Burnore's
threats and harassment.
True, but the chance that somone might be offensive is not
sufficient reason to censor it.  (If that were true, Usenet
references to Whitewater might be declared "pornographic" by the
Clinton administration.)  Gary Burnore keeps whining about posts
from "ANON assholes" not just "assholes" in general.  That
definitely reveals something about him.  If he were to gripe about
posts from "black assholes", one might (rightly) conclude that he
was a racist.  If he were flaming posts from "gay assholes", you'd
probably figure that he was a homophobe, right?  The fact that he
doesn't flame the CONTENT but some characteristic about the author
marks him as a bigot.
You've got a point there.   I don't place much faith in what I
see in the From:  line, even if it appears to be a valid e-mail

Diversified Product Inspections, Inc. (OTCBB: DPRI)
BUY AT $1.25
SELL TARGET $4.60 = DIAMOND PLAY !!!!
MAJOR CONTRACT ANNOUNCEMENTS AND HUGE NEWSLETTER COVERAGE THIS WEEK FOR DPRI !!!
Revenues for DPRI, a 10-year old, fully-reporting company, have  skyrocketed 600% higher this
year to over $8 Million on substantial US Government and Insurance Industry contracts. DPRI's
client list of over 50 major insurance companies includes Allstate, Fireman's Fund, Travelers,
Liberty Mutual, Prudential, Hartford, and Nationwide.
We are expecting significant news this week regarding increasing revenue and contract
expansion from DPRI's Fortune 500 customer base. The stock has already bounced sharply from
its 52-week low and will continue moving up immediately. We think the stock could easily climb
above $4 in less than a month.
WE ARE PROJECTING RECORD VOLUME AND PRICE APPRECIATION AS DPRI MAY VERY WELL BE ONE OF THE
MOST UNDERVALUED STOCKS ON THE OTCBB!!!

MAJOR CONTRACT ANNOUNCEMENTS AND HUGE NEWSLETTER COVERAGE THIS WEEK FOR DPRI !!!
Revenues for DPRI, a 10-year old, fully-reporting company, have  skyrocketed 600% higher this
year to over $8 Million on substantial US Government and Insurance Industry contracts. DPRI's
client list of over 50 major insurance companies includes Allstate, Fireman's Fund, Travelers,
Liberty Mutual, Prudential, Hartford, and Nationwide.
We are expecting significant news this week regarding increasing revenue and contract
expansion from DPRI's Fortune 500 customer base. The stock has already bounced sharply from
its 52-week low and will continue moving up immediately. We think the stock could easily climb
above $4 in less than a month.
WE ARE PROJECTING RECORD VOLUME AND PRICE APPRECIATION AS DPRI MAY VERY WELL BE ONE OF THE
MOST UNDERVALUED STOCKS ON THE OTCBB!!!
