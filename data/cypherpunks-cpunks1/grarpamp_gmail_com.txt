@_subject: Random chaff [was: more work for Grobbages] 
I was thinking solely of taps capable of observing user1, user2...
If user1 injects 1.21 MB of data on one side, and 1.21 MB of data
pops out the other side at injection time + network delay, the users
are made. Regardless of whether the observer can see inside the
network/crypto or operate in the network. And especially if the net
or users are quiet at that time.
But if there's chaff present, chaff that is only known to be chaff
by the network, or minimally by the recipient and generator, then
the game becomes harder. User1 and user2's pipes are always
independantly full of cap = ( chaff + wheat). Chaff is requested
from the network by the user's node to fill the cap during idle
times. The cap could be optional random dynamic, perhaps shrink
after some time of no wheat nearing the cap so as to not be needless
Users's nodes make [close?] peers just for traffic generation.
Tagged and controlled out of band. Involve the client's knowledge
that its socks or hidden service ports are generating n kbit/sec
of wheat.
Middle node link traffic could be similarly managed, albeit without
socks/hs knowledge, just bandwidth.
Any intelligent cell based clocking or committed rate management
within seem very hard when riding on the public internet. So it
would just be shoving bits into a hungry mouth until a gag message
comes back.
Maybe the problem with this idea is that the chaff generation system
might not be able to react fast enough when the real wheat travels
the pipes. So a 1.21 MB injection might still create some sort of
observable ripple at start and end times. The only way it might not
is if the pipes are oversubscribed _and_ packet lossy by design,
not just having the usual TCP congestion managed slowness. But that
would be terrible bad for most user facing applications and stacks.
Maybe it is the ripples that need hidden or randomized instead of
just filling pipes.
It seems safe to presume that near global passive adversaries exist.
And certainly ones cabaple of covering various regions. And that
offline processing of the mesh of flow information from them is
probably within current capabilities. I'm actually amazed we're not
seeing canaries kicking off all over the place. Particularly ones
involving exits.
The advice to run a relay while using the client seems sound due
to whatever free chaff it brings. Who knows.

@_subject: [tor] Softlayer finally kicks us from their data center 
Didn't know Cogent had gone that low yet, thx. HE is more a
provider of mixed services (colo/host/transit) than traditional
pipe though.
Sure. I guess my mention of being an ISP should have said it was
for purposes of going naturally alongside direct allocation.
In a former life, I did send notices to upstream pipe as needed.
ie: If there was an issue requiring it... traceroute, lookup and mail.
So even an independant ISP, in their own room, buying circuit from
L3/etc, could have a ticket lodged at L3. That was also the point about
structuring. Companies layer and silo things as suits them.
As would many rightly do, laws of other countries don't apply. Business
seeks to minimize cost, ignoring saves cost with minimal risk.
Yep, I left that part out of my prior note. That's a big problem as far as
opening up shop as a new ISP. For this or any other purpose. Especially
if you want to keep it private [held and funded] with organic growth... no
time left for that. Save for givebacks and if IANA/etc brokers private swaps,
direct v4 allocation simply won't exist, everything will be SWIP.
The v6 net, current OS's, DNS are all ready. A fair number of popular apps,
certainly opensource ones, do v6. So yes, Tor needs to become v6 capable.
The v4 game may be played out. But given that true global v6 adoption vs
NAT everywhere has what maybe a 50/50 chance?... early v6 ISP's could
make a killing. Maybe we'll be among them :)
Oh well, kindof off topic. Cheers.

@_subject: [tor-talk] What is tor used for? 
Tor is used for a lot of different things. Sure, the kiddy pron, drug and chan
waste and all the talk about those things is disgusting to see infiltrating
everywhere. But with nothing to do about it you just have to ignore it.
Yes, it would be cool to see stuff like EFF, EPIC, ACLU, Red Cross and
whatever else makes you happy all be multihomed into the anonymous
space. But really, if you can't get to them on the clearnet, or via Tor exits,
you probably have worse problems on your hands, like finding work, food,
shelter and not getting shot. Nor do they see it as being all that
helpful to them.
On the plus side, lots of people use Tor for totally benign and boring everyday
stuff, I certainly do. Think about it... IRC with friends, dating,
reading the paper,
contributing to forums and various projects, blogging, doing your banking and
school stuff, email, internet and systems work, looking for work,
writing freely with
random people, buying stuff. Whatever it might be that people do. It
all feels just
a bit better knowing your ISP. employer or government doesn't really
have such an
easy task anymore of cataloging or quoting you, tracking your home/work/travels,
turning you into a statistic, optimizing your online experience, or
any other such
things you might not want to happen. These certainly aren't examples of 'working
for the greater global good of humanity' or whatever, but it all adds
up. Kindof how
anti-spam systems reduce the profitability of spam. And in a way,
gaining back some
of the anonymity by default that everyone had before everyone and everything
went digital, online, databased, monetized and controlled in the 90's.
It's unlikely you'll find those who really need Tor for their
activities standing up and
saying here I am with their use cases in hand. They simply have better
things to do
and that would entail risk.
You're more likely to find relay ops and coders evangelizing to the
good. They are
the interfaces to the use cases and know what's out there. Just seeing
packets flow
through the occaisional relay I prop up makes me happy knowing at least some of
them weren't full of the aforementioned trash... even if they are just
our boring
daily stuffs.

And although I might trust Tor, it's not wise to trust a GPA such

easy to presume some reverse mail covers against the sellers

at least that long for any really big sealed case to go down in
public. So we truly must wait much longer in order to presume
the statement in (4) is true.
Tor cannot accept known 'illegal' money, therefore acknowledgement
is moot. About the best Tor could do is be able to accept anonymous
donations in the first place. Then publish a bitcoin address for donations
from anyone. Then surely some unaffiliated and helpful bird would send
to SR the links to that address and to this thread.
Not sure, but I think at one point Tor accepted bitcoin, but then recanted.

This is where Phantom has a huge advantage over Tor... always on, native
IPv6 transport via tunnel interface. You don't have to create all sorts of
'only with Tor' hooked apps like come with I2P. All the software you use
today just works [1]. Just point OS, apache, games, azureus, etc into that
address space and you're done. And so long as you don't mind
src spoofing, extra setup, and some non-optimums here and there,
you can get that on Tor with onioncat today.
[1] You did IPv6 feature ticket your favorite IPv4 only app didn't you...
Torproject isn't inventing select cases, they're the only cases they
can publish.
And they do so for two reasons... 1) Attract funding 2) Attempt to stave
off legal action to shut it down... such standoff hopefully made possible
through big sticks doing the funding, and a verifiable subset of published
use cases.
There's nothing stopping anyone from forking Tor, throwing it up on
github and moving to an unfunded, unspoken development model to
do all these things.
People can even fork their own and specifically pimp it for drugs, guns,
contract killing and CP. It won't do them or Tor or either's users any

Well, very few places take cash or money order in the mail. Call
them stupid to not take the money. Then there's AML with bitcoin,
Building a persistent nym is handy if you wish to establish such a
personage for compartemented tasks, etc. However, there are linkable
nyms and unlinkable ones.
Advocating that users or sites evolve to support only linkable nyms
is not a good idea. For example, the 'invite' or 'cell number' type
nym systems are an example of terrible privacy policy.
People need the ability to create new, unlinked, taint free, accounts
whenever they want. They many need more than one persona, or to
come back as a fresh incarnation of themselves when up against
unwarranted/irrational dislike.
Linkable nyms are worthless for some people and purposes, so I've
no problem with that lack.
If I ran a system, I would allow signups from anywhere, no 'recovery'
email, no name, no cell, no geoip. Nothing but username, password,
and a few strong captchas to keep out the bots. Maybe even a time
delay (n days) to calm down the impulse users. AND definitely... a
policy that allows me to nuke misbehaving accounts at will. Because
let's be honest, if you've got the helpdesk cycles to learn all
about VPN's, scrape proxy lists, scrape Tor, sink ip's etc... you've
surely got it to sink accounts on verifiable abuse reports. Come
on people, hitting 'delete' just isn't all that hard, especially
when your policy permits it.
Do NOT penalize those who need multiple random unlinked accounts
by blocking ip's, making up nym systems, etc. Penalize the accounts
that act up. They are the bad ones, not the former.
I would actually donate much more to Tor/EFF project if I could
earmark it for a formal emissary to talk with some of the sites
I've seen implementing bad policy. And hopefully report back to me
with the positive results ...
... because when I do (under a separate unlinkable nym of course), I
end up ignored as the expendable small guy.
Exactly! And when I can't use these sites in perfectly good,
responsible, creative and nice ways... because they have implemented
crap blocking policies... it pisses me the fuck off.

Subject only to Tor's defenses, such as CIDR block restrictions, a
node is a node. Going with the USA idea: what if the FBI, in the
normal course of business, calls up all their local cable/dsl/fiber/cell
providers and has a few lines run to each office and outhouse
nationwide. Not enough nodes? Maybe they offer their workers free
internet access and give them a secure little 'router'. Or use
routing and vpn tricks to buy/borrow enough CIDR safe node IP's
from whoever and route them all back to a node farm for easier
Only the node list needs to be classified against FOIA to prevent
blockage. Once the tech is figured out to the point that product
is producible, the remaining thing is what can be legally done with
it all. Warrantless and dragnet tap projects are holding up pretty
well so far, right? Certainly targeted actions are no problem.
No news of Tor daemons being cracked to date, right? Isn't Tor full
of nodes running all sorts of untrusted software under less than
perfect admin skills? It's pretty unlikely that 'chat room' busts
use Common Criteria systems either.
There is this thread for starters:
 I would also look to make sure the timing to a node makes sense
with its presumed geolocation. It should never be shorter than
possible, nor really much longer either.

Yes. They are two separate camps. Who now more regularly talk with

It's likely only a legal question as to what tools either may use.
Then saying, 'hey, we have this program', seems not a big deal.
Based on 4+ year old methods up against a first time case.
What were the lessons learned? What gaps are being filled?
Of course. That's why I put out possible examples that would only
utilize publicly known methods. There are no secrets in anonbib.
Secret projects have secret nets with secret admins...
I'm not really suggesting that any such global or national all
seeing system is in place. Only that given budgets and current tech,
the odds are surely not zero on some of the scenarios.
Particularly concerning results available even with limited visibility.
Such as running both a HS and an entry node that a user happens to
use. Or running enough nodes that having an interesting circuit
transit all three/six is less than a rare occurance.
Scaling Note: If the network needs to scale, such as keeping nodes
very busy but not saturated, non-exit relay by default (NE-RBD)
could be metered out by way of a client self enabling it (or whatever
other scale factor) based on the client's/relay's own fingerprint.

@_subject: [p2p-hackers] Distributed filesystem choices (aka: none yet?) 
Been looking for a distributed filesystem with no luck, any ideas?
Distributed meaning that there is no single central access point.
So the concept of mounting might mean amongst the roving set able
to service it, or some underlying graph of it, something like:
mount -t dht dht:// /dist1
Users add their free block devices to the global backing store which
was initialized with certain ZFS-like integrity and redundancy
Files would never vanish unless there are no longer enough blocks
in the backing store to meet the init time guarantees.
Users could either copy their hierarchies into the space, or attach
them into the space for continued local maintenance.
The one time init setting of a space could include whether pki
recognized root users could maintain the overall hierarchy.  Uid's
might be an insertion node id.
There may need to be voting authority on file/tree expiry if under
space pressure, perhaps bitcoin-like, with the metrics established
at init time.
Users could add their block devices to whatever pool had the metrics
they like.
Anononymity and crypto would provide incentive to donate resources
since unlike say bittorrent, no legal fear means no hit and run
I don't really know what it might look like. Just that it needs
sha2/3 integrity, redundancy, and file lifetime guarantees. It needs
to be global, anonymous, and be a usable file system. And somehow
deal with abusive fill such as dd if=/dev/zero of=zero, which implies
some kind of moderated hierarchies appointed by the initializing
AFS is nice that users can bolt their filespace into the tree, and
it has filesystem semantics.
ZFS/BTRFS is nice due to their sha256 integrity, raidz redundancy
and simple backing block device ideas.
FreeNet/GnuNet/BitTorrent and all other 'filesharing' protocols are
no good because there is no guarantee that files will not vanish.
And they have no filesystem semantics, only push/fetch.
RedHat GFS / DragonFly HAMMER are interesting as a distributed
filesystem in which real work can be done on live files.
Tahoe-LAFS is nice due to adding in block devices, but no good
because of the central access point. Perhaps that could be distributed?
Phantom/I2P/Tor could be used as the backend IP transport.
The only thing that makes it worth while is that a lot of people
have free space, want to give an get data, safely, and don't want
to see their work in populating it wasted... so it can't go away.

Resnick: The recent article in Wired describes where and how the NSA plans to
store its share of collected data. But as the article explains, the Utah
facility will have another important function: cryptanalysis, or
code-breaking, as much of the data cycling through will be heavily encrypted.
It also suggests that the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), expected to
remain durable for at least another decade, may be cracked by the NSA in a
much shorter time if theybve built a secret computer that is considerably
faster than any of the machines we know about. But more to the pointbis
encryption safe?
Guessing it's pretty much as on the wrapper. In another interview
Binney speaks of a cryptographic breakthrough. If you look at the
physical size of the datacenters, you can easily envision massive
index tables, rainbow or otherwise, for storing shortcuts to various
projects. Note that ever since MySpace, network analysis has been
the rage. Combine that with 15-20 years of public datamining and
10-15 years of easily tappable fiber and datacenters. Toss in some
really smart people and PhD's and sure, there are bound to be some
big and secret advances in data processing and even crypto in play
You don't need big DC's for that, just better software and human

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor and P2P 
Allow me to combine some quotes from this recent thread alone...
It seems pretty clear we are at the point where there are current
and growing ideas and demand for all manner of anonymous P2P services.
In part driven by global news, and thus global awareness, that
governments, business and others have questionable regard for
privacy, etc.
And if consumers continue to demand and drive openness into products,
there will soon come a day when open, BSD/Linux capable, pad devices
(PC + wifi + cell) the size of a DVD case are common. Demand,
compounded by utility.
Regardless of the capacity for the sort of projects listed below
to handle it, people WILL build these services. Some of them are
out there today, and being largely unknown, they are performing
well enough. More users will try them and adopt them based on need,
utility and performance. The only question is how will the networks
perform at each stage of popularity.
Given that these services are surely coming in force... and from
directions that see these networks more as a raw transport than
say, primarily for the purposes outlined on their respective web
pages... it seems the usual echo of "we're a nice project, don't
do that, too much load" may not be useful. This should not imply
fault, but merely suggest that it's dated and hopeless.
And since the networks are anonymous, countermeasures would affect
all users matching the metric, even those using it for said purposes.
So maybe there's room for more focused/funded research into the
actual impacts of different traffic models (leading to proper
resource giveback by apps/users/groups), development improvement
in the networks to handle the traffic, even up to creating an
entirely new anonymous network optimized for P2P ...
... before this certainty happens.
Do what is needed to go forth and conquer :)
P2P services should look at the current strong anonymization projects
that could provide transport. The ones I know of are:
More links are welcome.
People should not make the mistake of assuming they can freely use
any network without negative impact. Including fatal impact for
their own service. They should offer sufficient resources back to
the network. Contrary to popular belief, P2P is not a free ride.
Relay, directory and index is expensive and the cost is bandwidth,
CPU and storage.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor and P2P 
Is, or can Tor be, useful or optimal? On which platforms? With what
P2P apps or traffic patterns?
Assuming these are the only cores available at this time...
Running a P2P app will require running one of the above cores. Which
means all peers already have access to each core's internal addressing
scheme, respectively: i2p, private IPv6, onion. And thus they have access
to each other.
So though Tor is unique in having exit facilities by design, those
facilities are not needed for a global P2P mesh to work.
Tor's uniqueness and its perhaps as yet uncharacterized ability to
handle certain P2P loads should lead to a comparative review of the
utility of other cores.
If you can speak IPv6, you can speak Phantom, which makes app
development incredibly simple. Written in C. Probably the lightest
weight core so far. Needs some review. Presents a native, node
specific, source address.
I2P has the most network experience so far with lots of P2P connections
going on, ala bittorrent. More work is needed to interface apps
with it. Written in Java. Does not present a native, node specific,
source address?
If you need to use exit for other things, you may not have room to
run multiple cores, provide some resources back, etc. So Tor would
make sense in that case. Does not present a native, node specific,
source address.
There are certainly more comparisons to be made.
It does provide an IPv6 interface/layer, that is definitely a win since
you can use all the usual network programming methods and apps.
It is not a P2P app, only a shim for Tor and I2P. And it needs
further work to provide IPv6 to HS/I2P PKI authentication. I might
be inclined to sign all the traffic ala IPSEC before attempting
some ping pong scheme.
On a big scale, it might make sense for all the anonymous networks
to use interfaces and IPv6 node addresses for interop purposes.
Though there are some current problems there... Tor's 80 bits may
be too small, I2P's 256 is wider than can be packed under an IPv6/48.

I likely ran into some of this a while back with something I was

If you're expecting to be doing lots of session initiation, I think
you're going to hit some significant local CPU issues, especially
those of you thinking of P2P applications running on "smaller than
laptop" devices. An occaisional message in the manner in which you
might normally 'text', would work ok. But if you expect to have
some sort of pidgin/sip buddy list full of status and people bouncing
around doing things, it could become ugly. Certainly far worse for
torrenting as the extreme example. And when thousands of people
come online with P2P like that... yeah.
On the other hand, once the session state is up, things seem better
and you're back to the usual latency, bandwidth and reliability
limits of the relay system.
P2P doesn't generally keep sessions up, so it's back to step one.
So it would be interesting to see where this could go.
- Extending circuit and other timeouts for hidden services?
- Storing related TCP or Tor states locally?

bit of extra setup for that is all.
They use it a lot for that. Admittedly I really should learn more
about the full mechanics of this one.
When I last looked briefly at this one a couple years back, the
users were not necessarily anonymous to each other. It seemed to
require users to know and/or trust one another. If that was the
case, anonymous transport layer would have been required underneath
it to match the level of anonymity the three projects I listed.
Maybe they solved that since then?

@_subject: [tor-relays] BitTorrent complaint 
As opposed to torrenting via exits, I'm amazed more people haven't
moved their torrenting to operate entirely within anonymous networks.
The performance of I2P and Tor (and I guess Phantom during tests) is
actually quite usable so long as the user excercises content selection
and patience. And regarding this thread, the freedom of operators and
users from complaints regarding takedown would be invaluable.
I'm not sure if these networks could scale to handle the node count
and chatter, but I think the bit about spare cycles is right and might
even act as a natural limiter to that sort of traffic. For instance, my
tests show that establishing connections to many onions in parallel
is quite costly and prone to failure without available headroom. But
once connected, things are ok.
Perhaps torrenters simply can't put aside their 'must download it all
right now' mentality which keeps them away from our nodes. Or there
is a major influx waiting to happen upon some future enlightenment
whether they're misguided or not.

You don't need to offer webmail.
The setup is not hard.

All of them teaching the user how to encrypt, exactly where

There are already cleanslate systems cryptographically
secure against content and internal addressing snooping.
The resistance to global passive/active adversaries
from connecting the realworld IP talkers needs work.
And to truly replace traditional email (especially in the

messaging clients...  lots of spec decisions to be made
there... lots of traction with existing thunderbird, mutt,

swap out their legacy smtp/imap network semantics.
Then you have the userspace key management for end2end
message security to work on as well.
All of this is interconnected too... once you start designing

Yes, applying some of the areas you mentioned to building new physical

Almost everyone can find some cheap 3+ ethernet port
routing capable device these days. Add protocols on top.
I should have been more clear on the topic of my note... right now we
have really good content encryption for I2P/Tor/etc type networks. And
pretty good intelligently random multi hop routing mechanisms.
But because of our silly desire to not fill our pipes with chaff,
we've made it easier in some cases for GPA's [1] to watch and
connect the inputs/outputs across a relatively silent backbone...
whether by timing, or transfer amount over time. Now if you dedicate
N kbps to the net and fill it, and everyone else picks their commit rate
and fills it, that passive weakness goes away. A bit like ATM, you
won't move any more than your rate over it, but you idly fill it
with chaff that gets discarded somewhere else at no extra cost.
Keeping lines full is inverted thinking, so I'm not sure if anyone's

Gmail seems intent on refusing signups via Tor without
supplying other linkable and not rationally expendable
data such as phone. I expect they'll bleed off users who
need this to other providers through attrition, and incur
negative publicity from prospective new users for failing
to support it in these days.
There were a few threads over on tor-talk in which a
gmail staff participated. Some community suggestion
was made for refundable bitcoin deposit to appease
the google claims, not sure where that went.
Amongst your convinceable and tutorable peers, yes
of course. Amongst the rest of the world..
..I don't agree. It will be a long time before anything
replaces traditional email worldwide. Until then traditional
email services do need to be out there... accessible via
Tor and free / donation based for basic messaging use.
Independant mail nodes can work if done well, that's
essentially what TorMail, Lavabit, SC, Hush, etc are.
And though you may encrypt the body, there are uses
for which you don't want to (non crypto peers). Know
the weaknesses, your tools, and pick the right one for
the right use. TorMail was in some sense the most
interesting thing since the mail mixes. And other services
that try to do crypto for you, can't, it's impossible hype.
Better to continue building OpenPGP etc into traditional
mail clients smoother.

No, that is old model. Yet how ahead and gracious are the punks?
imap4[s only], submission[starttls only], transport smtp[s preferred,
and fixed keyed amongst peers], nothing asked for but username and
password, allow connections from anywhere including Tor, simple
documentation for the user (thunderbird, mutt, outlook, openpgp,
enigmail, ...)
The demand for these things is very high right now.
You don't need to offer webmail.
The setup is not hard.
There could be 30 new mail providers running around the globe in
three months.
All of them teaching the user how to encrypt, exactly where
it belongs.
And that's just for simple mail, a big win, even without resorting
to more exotic  systems.
Unless it is the user who keeps and manages their own keys, no
service with any 'offer of encryption that actually protects' can
ever be true. Services are classed by who manages the keys. Any
service that manages keys on behalf of the user and claims to offer
protection is nothing more than a false marketing SCAM.
Unfortunately, people keep buying the bullshit.

When you cleanslate things you are not held back by the past.
Napster, bittorrent, icq... all completely new and instant mass appeal,
because they did something that people wanted. That overrode every other
consideration the user had, including... now hang on, I know this will
be hard for some to believe.... downloading and installing the app and
actually learning how to use it.
These days, there is a want for secure messaging. Thanks to recent

now want to 'send secret messages'. I don't have time so the standard
answer is usually 'read and pick something from prism-break.org.'
There are already cleanslate systems cryptographically
secure against content and internal addressing snooping.
The resistance to global passive/active adversaries
from connecting the realworld IP talkers needs work.
And to truly replace traditional email (especially in the
business world) you will need a community of powerful
messaging clients...  lots of spec decisions to be made
there... lots of traction with existing thunderbird, mutt,
etc UI/handling frontends. But can you save that and
swap out their legacy smtp/imap network semantics.
Then you have the userspace key management for end2end
message security to work on as well.
All of this is interconnected too... once you start designing
a strong messaging system, it begins to look like a general
purpose transport, possibly one with parameterized options.
Then you start thinking how to plug other apps into it. So
you're back to looking like another I2P, Tor, GnuNet, Phantom,
Freenet, AnoNet, etc... lots of the same stuff under the hood.

Yes, applying some of the areas you mentioned to building new physical
networks, grafting in pieces of the existing net where needed... good stuff.
Almost everyone can find some cheap 3+ ethernet port
routing capable device these days. Add protocols on top.
I should have been more clear on the topic of my note... right now we
have really good content encryption for I2P/Tor/etc type networks. And
pretty good intelligently random multi hop routing mechanisms.
But because of our silly desire to not fill our pipes with chaff,
we've made it easier in some cases for GPA's [1] to watch and
connect the inputs/outputs across a relatively silent backbone...
whether by timing, or transfer amount over time. Now if you dedicate
N kbps to the net and fill it, and everyone else picks their commit rate
and fills it, that passive weakness goes away. A bit like ATM, you
won't move any more than your rate over it, but you idly fill it
with chaff that gets discarded somewhere else at no extra cost.
Keeping lines full is inverted thinking, so I'm not sure if anyone's
tried to napkin mechanisms for that.

That's why you should only use services that send such

Encryption is only part of it. There's transport, elimination of
central storage, anonymity, p2p, etc. Many things people want
simply can't be done with modifications to the current system.
With p2p model and every node as a key/address, you don't
need 'pgp' because the node is the key and does lookups and
encrypt2dest / decrypt2you for you. But you can still use pgp with
the usual tools around message bodies if desired for additional
encrypt/auth or if you're disk isn't encrypted. P2P daemon
takes over and all the old transport headers go away.
Spam/AV becomes another local daemon. Mailing lists are

@_subject: The next generation secure email solution 
Moving the last couple days talk to this thread seems fine.
Though unclear, that sounds like the old trust of a CA/PKI system problem.
In general I suggest that people wish to use messaging with each other
once they already know them (or have some other trusted web to them).
As in, Hey John, nice to meet ya today, what's your key (address), I'll
message you later. Or Hey Jane, what's John's address. Same for
employers, businesses, etc. Such peer groups bootstrap and grow
very fast. Thus the perceived need for a cold lookup of Ralf, isn't much of
a real one.
Once you know the address (node crypto key), you put it 'To: ',
mua hands to spool, p2p daemon reads spool, looks up key in DHT and
sends msg off across the transport to the far key (node) when it is
reachable. Hopefully the transport looks like I2P/Tor in being a secure
random hop layer. In fact, those could probably be used today, they
have the keys as nodes and user facing ports for inbound/outbound
daemons. They just need scaling work to n-billion nodes (users,
aka: the hard part). People are already plugging postfix, bittorrent,
etc into these networks.
Tor is not currently addressible at the user level by the full key,
it 'shortens' the key into a 16char onion address. As you may be
hinting at... yes, that is bad... collisions, and needing secondary lookup
layers into the full key. Tor may be moving to full key addressibility
soon, see tor-dev for that.
I2P (and Phantom, and probably GnuNet) are addressible with full keys.
So you can send to 'account with them if you want, and keep the
John/Jane/Ralf human style lookups in your MUA addressbook (once
you know them) without needing a secondary lookup layer into the full key.
No, I am not sure. But when looking at some of the p2p transport
layers that have come along so far, it seems like a fairly strong
possibility for a new backend transport model while retaining user
level mail tools... mutt, maildrop, mailman, Thunderbird, etc. Most
of what you'd need there is support for very long addresses and
split horizon handoff to local daemon/spool based on recognizing
what the destination net is... .onion, .i2p, etc.
I'd like to read what Pond and I2P-Bote are doing with some parts of
this as well.
I don't believe you need a trusted CA/PKI service to successfully
bootstrap users and their addresses/keys into a new global messaging
system. If I want to know what some unknown like Bruce's key is, I'll
look it up on his website, social net, list posts, etc. If that's what you

As an aside: If you can make that overlay net present an IPv6 tunnel
interface on the local host, that lets you use any IPv6 enabled

Everyone knows there are active attacks against
'Tor' users... ie: the apps they attach to it. Those are
cheap wins for the adversary and unrelated to Tor.
There are attempts to exploit Tor daemon and other various
access to 0wn or run the relays themselves to get at the
plaintext or the service running behind Tor. Not much
to do there but harden Tor and the relays and run more
independant ones. And nobody's cracking the crypto on
the wire anytime soon. Those aren't really related to
Tor, but standard practice.
Tor can have it's hidden services found via various
published attacks involving deploying analysis nodes.
There are caveats, and the cost isn't that much, but
it takes time. It's in the papers.
I'd caution on one debated thing about adversaries... we know
there are at least a few adversaries in the world that have *very*
good regional coverage with network taps. So contrary
to some opinions, I'd suggest it would be rather possible for them
to use those and determine who is talking to who by correlating
traffic passing the taps... if your traffic happened to begin and
end within that region it could be game over. That's in the
papers too.
Low latency nets that do not use fill traffic are simply
not resistant to timing/correlation attacks. Tor is low latency
and does not use fill traffic. It's not a break, it's a design
choice/tradeoff. Depending on how you use these networks,
it may or may not be an issue for you.
Tor was never meant to do everything, yet it's quite good
at what it does, and publishing what it doesn't.

Obviously. It will never be able to escape the non-body
header content and third party routing, storage and analysis with
any form of patching over today's mail. And it's completely
ridiculous that people continue to invest [aka: waste] effort in
'securing' it. The best you'll ever get clients down to is exposing
a single 'To:' header within an antique transport model that
forces you to authenticate to it in order to despam, bill, censor
and control you.
That system is cooked, done and properly fucked. Abandon it.
What the world needs now is a real peer to peer messaging
system that scales. Take Tor for a partial example... so long
as all the sender/recipient nodes [onions] are up, any message
you send will get through, encrypted, in real time. If a recipient
is not up, you queue it locally till they are... no third party ever
needed, and you get lossless delivery and confirmation for free.
Unmemorable node address?, quit crying and make use of your
local address book. Doesn't have plugins for current clients?,
so what, write some and use it if you're dumb enough to mix
the old and new mail.
The only real problem that still needs solved is scalability...
what p2p node lookup systems are out there that will handle
a messaging world's population worth of nodes [billions] and
their keys and tertiary data? If you can do that, you should
be able to get some anon transport over the p2p for free.
Anyway, p2p messaging and anonymous transports have
all been dreamed up by others before. But now is the
time to actually abandon traditional email and just do it.
If you build it, they will come.
I'm strongly against most the ideas to abbandon current email systems,
because the results will be to create wallet garden.
We need something interoperable with existing systems or the system will
just be used by a bunch of paranoid people or fostered by the marketing
of few cryptography company acquiring customers, not user.
It would be interoperable with current end user interfaces/tools, but not
directly with you
As with everything else, today's seeds grow into tomorrows garden, sometimes
you just have to thorougly plow under last year's chaff first, that's by design.
E-mail is basically business correspondence.
    - E-mail is stored.
    - E-mail is sent to many people outside your personal social network.
    - Business recipients of email are often subject to corporate and/or
      regulatory policy constraints that are in conflict with end-to-end
      encryption.
The above list of features can be greatly expanded, and the
consequences elaborated, but I doubt may on this list truly need
to be re-educated about email.
So I will confidently predict that end-to-end secure email will
remain a niche service used by a tiny minority.
Even businesses that one might expect to implement at least encryption
to the "gateway", are in many cases choosing to out-source their
gateway to 3rd-party providers (anti-spam and anti-virus offerings
only work with un-encrypted email, and in many cases the provider
also operates the entire mail store).

Nothing here changes, only the backend transport between nodes.
Once your node decrypts the message to your local system pipes,
you can do all this and more with it. Including running a 'business' node
and doing whatever you want with the plaintext after your node daemon
passes it to you. This is not about those ancient protocols. It's also
about 'messaging' not strictly 'email'... those lines are already well
blurred, no need to distinguish between them anymore. A 'light'
messaging client could simply ignore the non transport email headers,
or use your standard msg address.
Please do not continue to talk about antique tradional centralized
systems in this thread, except of course to bash and route around them.
The speed of a real P2P/DHT replacement at scale is a research challenge.
this would make an interesting bet!  i too believe this to be
impossible given the constraints.
I'm not so sure about this, look at all the global resources being poured
into traditional email, and attempts to 'fix' it. Now redirect fractional 1%
of those resources and put them into a P2P replacement. That's ftw.

which didn't seem scalable or reliable at all. I may be
wrong as I read more later.
I think that's working now. And is the general idea, create a strong
overlay network with a frontend MUA's can speak to.
As an aside: If you can make that overlay net present an IPv6 tunnel
interface on the local host, that lets you use any IPv6 enabled
app over it. I'm doubting the world needs a dozen application
specific overlay networks. More like just a few classes of network.
- message based store and forward
- low latency IPv6 transport
- data storage and retrieval
Bote mail doesn't have to be used for it's anonymous properties, for
me that is just a bonus. For many people it is more than enough to be
able to know that it is impossible for anybody else than the intended
recipient to read the message thanks to public key addressing.
Guaranteed end-to-end security if you can verify the address.
I don't think anything that doesn't fundamentally rely on public key
addressing is the (long term) future. There will inevitably issues
otherwise, including more issues of the type we have with CA:s today.
For those who want to make it more user friendly, nothing stops you
from adding a transparent "address translation layer" where servers
are involved. When you want to send a message to a person with a human
readable address at a server, then the server could then reply with
the public key based address to the mail client, and the user would
have the option to see what that address is. It could even be logged
by the client, with TOFU/POP style trust system that reduces the
amount of trust you have to place in the server. No need to trust
anybody with plaintext.
I suggest such interfacing with the current legacy system will only prolong
it's long past due extinction. Build a better system and let them come to you,
not the other way around. And bolting in exits will only make it harder to
do correctly and optimally what you need to do as a P2P system. Please,
just forget about interfacing with the legacy transport system. If you really
need that you can run your own p2p daemon node that acts as your
automated gateway between the two. This is mostly about design of
the p2p side, not that.
It is my understanding of the proposed replacement for email.  Magic
email addresses that in fact correspond to an identifier of a public
key, for example the hash of a rule that identifies the public key,
and which result in your message not in fact being passed along by
email protocols.
If you're not going to send directly to the very long account then
yes, you'll need to create another layer on top to hold your h(key). However,
the key must still be obtainable behind that since that is what the messages
will ultimately be encrypted and routed to. It's not much of a stretch beyond
that to ensure userland mail tools can handle say 8k long addresses. I'm not
against such a [vanity/shorthash] layer.
Bote mail and I2P messenger are two pieces of serverless software that
ALREADY is public key addressed within I2P. Have you tried them? You
need to add the public keys of the recipients to be able to send a
message to start with, although the DHT based search system Seedless
allow you to publish Bote mail addresses to the network.
(IMAP support for Bote mail is planned but not yet implemented, right
now it has a local web interface.)
Maybe Namecoin could work together with them to enable you to register
your key addresses to your nickname in a secure manner, but then you
still have to have a globally unique nickname and tell people the
exact spelling.
Though unclear, that sounds like the old trust of a CA/PKI system problem.
In general I suggest that people wish to use messaging with each other
once they already know them (or have some other trusted web to them).
As in, Hey John, nice to meet ya today, what's your key (address), I'll
message you later. Or Hey Jane, what's John's address. Same for
employers, businesses, etc. Such peer groups bootstrap and grow
very fast. Thus the perceived need for a cold lookup of Ralf, isn't much of
a real one.
Once you know the address (node crypto key), you put it 'To: ',
mua hands to spool, p2p daemon reads spool, looks up key in DHT and
sends msg off across the transport to the far key (node) when it is
reachable. Hopefully the transport looks like I2P/Tor in being a secure
random hop layer. In fact, those could probably be used today, they
have the keys as nodes and user facing ports for inbound/outbound
daemons. They just need scaling work to n-billion nodes (users,
aka: the hard part). People are already plugging postfix, bittorrent,
etc into these networks.
Tor is not currently addressible at the user level by the full key,
it 'shortens' the key into a 16char onion address. As you may be
hinting at... yes, that is bad... collisions, and needing secondary lookup
layers into the full key. Tor may be moving to full key addressibility
soon, see tor-dev for that.
I2P (and Phantom, and probably GnuNet) are addressible with full keys.
So you can send to 'account with them if you want, and keep the
John/Jane/Ralf human style lookups in your MUA addressbook (once
you know them) without needing a secondary lookup layer into the full key.
No, I am not sure. But when looking at some of the p2p transport
layers that have come along so far, it seems like a fairly strong
possibility for a new backend transport model while retaining user
level mail tools... mutt, maildrop, mailman, Thunderbird, etc. Most
of what you'd need there is support for very long addresses and
split horizon handoff to local daemon/spool based on recognizing
what the destination net is... .onion, .i2p, etc.
I'd like to read what Pond and I2P-Bote are doing with some parts of
this as well.
I don't believe you need a trusted CA/PKI service to successfully
bootstrap users and their addresses/keys into a new global messaging
system. If I want to know what some unknown like Bruce's key is, I'll
look it up on his website, social net, list posts, etc. If that's what you
I feel like I walking in halfway into a conversation, I'm guessing this
started on the cryptography list that I'm not on.
Your DHT comment caught my attention though.  What in particular about
DHTs don't seem scalable or reliable?
Seems like DHTs are regularly in the 5-10M range and I don't see any
reason that DHTs couldn't be 10 times that.
Any reasonable churn rate and reliability could be handled with
replication.  The bit-torrent DHT for instance claims that 45% of users
that bootstrap from a central node are reachable 15 minutes later.  So
typical setups involve 8 nodes per bin, and 20 bins.  So every 15
minutes you ping 160 hosts, only reach 45%, and do some work to
repopulate the missing slots.
Given the simplicity of the bit-torrent DHT I think there's plenty of
room for improvement.  Larger routing tables are obvious (at the cost of
more network bandwidth to track peers).
The most promising idea for DHT improvements I've seen is to divide
peers into 3 latency groups.  High, medium, and low.   Much like L1
cache, L2 cache, and main memory.  That way common queries are very
fast, yet all queries still to find keys globally.
Bittorrent is already in the 100m node range. That's not enough. This
needs to replace every possible messaging user on the planet over
the duration of their actiive lifetime. That's at least a couple billion nodes.
Don't forget, you can always use disk to cache things.
But at the same time the system has to not say, "I can't deliver your
message to that person because an invisible gnotzaframmit that I won't
describe to you seems to be unavailable to me in the flabogrommit."
Address books as usual. Name layer if need be. We are humans, we
learn new lexicons, we write manuals, that part is nothing to be afraid of.
Being afraid only holds you back.
This is an interesting idea, because it provides certificates on
demand for ordinary users, if they decide to sign up to a certain
site. The
certs are then being used for other purposes, so the site does act as a
bootstap for using crypto. The one thing that this proposal relies on is
the availability of a common piece of software (user agent) that stores
the private key for the user. It's this part of the picture where things
get tricky.
There can be no non-distributed/redundant elements in this p2p system,
aka: no 'sites', certainly none with a realworld IP on them, and none where
very high percentages of them vanishing will disrupt the system for others.
This must replace email, therefore system disruption is intolerable.

More summary pasting...
Encryption is only part of it. There's transport, elimination of
central storage, anonymity, p2p, etc. Many things people want
simply can't be done with modifications to the current system.
With p2p model and every node as a key/address, you don't
need 'pgp' because the node is the key and does lookups and
encrypt2dest / decrypt2you for you. But you can still use pgp with
the usual tools around message bodies if desired for additional
encrypt/auth or if you're disk isn't encrypted. P2P daemon
takes over and all the old transport headers go away.
Spam/AV becomes another local daemon. Mailing lists are
a repeater node someone runs, or the usual local mailman stuff.
It's a transport replacement, so business can use it account
All the MTA's [connected directly to the internet] die off in time.

I think this is one of many design choices to be made.
Extra bandwidth is hard to avoid, unless the topology is
point(sender)-to-point(recipient). Yet with that, there is no effort made
to hide who is physically talking to who. We want to try to defeat this
type of analysis, so we can't be simply point-to-point.
 ie: bittorrent and today's email are point-to-point, no multihop.
Next is storage (mix) vs. latency (tunnels). This seems less clear to
me when up against analysis. Filling circuits (tunnels) with chaff
seems interesting. And with deliverey directly to your recipient over
some tunnel circuit, you don't have to build in complex message redundancy
protocols (more storage float outstanding) to ensure your message 100%
gets there when 90% of the nodes go offline taking your stored message
with them. You also get direct realtime delivery confirmation too.
The question arises, how does one provide free anonymous transport
to those anons who simply can't pay because they are anon? How
do you 'get users' when the mentality is 'for free'? Bittorrent/Tor are
free and seem to work ok. Though it's also probably not unreasonable
to suggest (and harder to enforce) that you get 1:1 what resources you
donate to it. ie: I need to push 1GiB this month, so I need to provision at
minimum 1+Nx1GiB to do that... 1 for me, Nx1 for the net due to my use
(where N is some impact ratio inherent in the design of the net, such
as number hops.)

It is worth noting that Phantom does this natively without needing an overlay on
top of another net. It may also use disk to cache some network information, at

I'd assume the design will rightly provide complete end2end encryption between
your source spool and your recipients spool over whatever bits are in between,
as a result of having the key, equivalent to the node, equivalent to
the address.
Store and forward might need to expose only the destination key to the storage
and routing net. A direct circuit would not.
All the legacy 'received' headers are gone by definition. A full raw message
might contain some required bits for continued use with your favorite mail tools
post handoff to you:
recipient. Since the net itself would seem to need to be anonymous, then it is
likely not. Nor is it a problem if it is... you just generate yourself
a new node if concerned.
To, Cc, Bcc
Antispam/antivirus becomes responsibility of the sender/recipient so no
headers there. No legacy dkim, spf, etc, either.
There may be a new set of transport preference headers if the design calls
for it. ie: You might be able to use the net with full mail clients
like mutt, thunderbird.
Or with a light 'messaging' client protocol. Each of which might have
a slightly different
interface into and out of the node.
Addresses might look like:
[user/function or protocol/arbitrary string] pubkey/hash]
I've no idea, only to see if interested people think some sort of nextgen
P2P/DHT system is actually possible at scale.

Afaik, skype used a central lookup to get to unknown peers, not a DHT.
So they perhaps knew who wanted to talk to who. Of course now skype
is untrusted by anyone with a clue.
Sure, there's a class of users that want this, a big class. They can
have and use their modified legacy centralized email as they wish.
There's another big class that want's something more than that.
We're also going to see faster hardware, lighter code, and maybe
even wearable battery packs... because as you say, these users
want it all and are willing to go to almost any means to get it.
There could also be ways to make the heavier weight anonymous
routing p2p transport let these lightweight clients stub in just to make a
direct p2p connection for encrypted voip/messaging (if say you
published your node as accepting that option).
We're exploring ideas. What is to say we are able to develop into it some
kind of automaton taho-lafs delivery storage nodes. Storing messages in
transit under some expiry policy is not a huge space concern. So who knows.
Maybe everyone with their uber important phones will end
up VPN to their home/colo servers where the horsepower is.
Predicting mobile is hard. Throw more apps out there and your
$30-50/mo unlimited data plans go away. Now is everyone going
to pay $150+/mo for that? Where is free open wifi going to end up
spanning? And so many other things.
What I think is clear is that there will for the far to indefinite forseeable
future be some form of real workstation/laptop in the home and office.
Phones just can't replace that. Maybe we're seeing something in how
you see larger tablet/netbooks/laptops with headsets being carried about
now as if it is natural. And lots of those people will want a highly
secure system to communicate over with their peers in this new
world of disgustingly gratuitous surveillance and databasing.
I would not underestimate the demand for that sort of a comms system.
That could be the multimodal thing above. Or the in network thing.
DSPAM, spamassassin, clamav and the like do fairly well enough
on their own locally.
I suggest not cataloging a defeatist list of what you think you can't
do... but rather what you could do, what you would gain and what
could happen if you build it :)
That's why you should be doing the development of these new
protocols entirely within existing secure networks such as Tor
and I2P. And why you should bootstrap via peers instead of
clearnet authorities like Tor that can be shutdown... it's a little
less secure, but you can have in network authorities wrapped
in web of trust and then rejoin listening only to them later. And
if clearnet get''s that bad, it becomes a freedom of speech issue
which is well, SHTF time.

Everyone knows there are active attacks against

There are attempts to exploit Tor daemon and other various

to do there but harden Tor and the relays and run more
independant ones. And nobody's cracking the crypto on

Tor can have it's hidden services found via various
published attacks involving deploying analysis nodes.
There are caveats, and the cost isn't that much, but
it takes time. It's in the papers.
I'd caution on one debated thing about adversaries... we know
there are at least a few adversaries in the world that have *very*
good regional coverage with network taps. So contrary
to some opinions, I'd suggest it would be rather possible for them
to use those and determine who is talking to who by correlating
traffic passing the taps... if your traffic happened to begin and
end within that region it could be game over. That's in the
papers too.
Low latency nets that do not use fill traffic are simply
not resistant to timing/correlation attacks. Tor is low latency
and does not use fill traffic. It's not a break, it's a design
choice/tradeoff. Depending on how you use these networks,
it may or may not be an issue for you.
Tor was never meant to do everything, yet it's quite good

This thread pertains specifically to the use of P2P/DHT models
to replace traditional email as we know it today. There was
a former similarly named thread on this that diverged... from the
concept and challenge of P2P/DHT handling the transport and
lookups... back to more traditional models. This thread does not
care about those antique models, please do not take it there.
In short, we're attempting to examine and develop some form
of new transport that looks somewhat like a mix between secure
anonymous networks, string at pubkey node addressing, massive
decentralized dht-like scaling and finally a user facing daemon that
moves messages into and out of local spools for use by normal
user/system tools.
Pasting in a very rough and unflowing thread summary to date
for interested people to pick up and discuss, draft, etc.
How many times has this been rehashed the last six months?
You can't fix email as we know it today using todays bolt-ons,
protocols and corporate stakeholders/services trying to profit from it.
The only way to have any real global seamless success is to go
ground up with a completely new model. IMO, that will be some
form of p2p message system where every address is a crypto key,
masked for grandma by her contact list, decrypted out your p2p
daemon and piped into your local mail processing (MUA/filter/lists)
and filesystem (encryption). At least that way your local mail tools
will still work (no one will give those up anyway).
The problem is the antique centralized backend, it needs bypassed.
You've got neat stuff like Tor, bittorrent, bitcoin, etc already... so
boost email into the 2020's the same way. Then let the old world
email services try to keep up, and slowly die like everything else.
Obviously. It will never be able to escape the non-body
header content and third party routing, storage and analysis with
any form of patching over today's mail. And it's completely
ridiculous that people continue to invest [aka: waste] effort in
'securing' it. The best you'll ever get clients down to is exposing
a single 'To:' header within an antique transport model that
forces you to authenticate to it in order to despam, bill, censor
and control you.
That system is cooked, done and properly fucked. Abandon it.
What the world needs now is a real peer to peer messaging
system that scales. Take Tor for a partial example... so long
as all the sender/recipient nodes [onions] are up, any message
you send will get through, encrypted, in real time. If a recipient
is not up, you queue it locally till they are... no third party ever
needed, and you get lossless delivery and confirmation for free.
Unmemorable node address?, quit crying and make use of your
local address book. Doesn't have plugins for current clients?,
so what, write some and use it if you're dumb enough to mix
the old and new mail.
The only real problem that still needs solved is scalability...
what p2p node lookup systems are out there that will handle
a messaging world's population worth of nodes [billions] and
their keys and tertiary data? If you can do that, you should
be able to get some anon transport over the p2p for free.
Anyway, p2p messaging and anonymous transports have
all been dreamed up by others before. But now is the
time to actually abandon traditional email and just do it.
If you build it, they will come.
I'm strongly against most the ideas to abbandon current email systems,
because the results will be to create wallet garden.
We need something interoperable with existing systems or the system will
just be used by a bunch of paranoid people or fostered by the marketing
of few cryptography company acquiring customers, not user.
It would be interoperable with current end user interfaces/tools, but not
directly with you at some.dotcom.
As with everything else, today's seeds grow into tomorrows garden, sometimes
you just have to thorougly plow under last year's chaff first, that's by design.
E-mail is basically business correspondence.
    - E-mail is stored.
    - E-mail is sent to many people outside your personal social network.
    - Business recipients of email are often subject to corporate and/or
      regulatory policy constraints that are in conflict with end-to-end
      encryption.
The above list of features can be greatly expanded, and the
consequences elaborated, but I doubt may on this list truly need
to be re-educated about email.
So I will confidently predict that end-to-end secure email will
remain a niche service used by a tiny minority.
Even businesses that one might expect to implement at least encryption
to the "gateway", are in many cases choosing to out-source their
gateway to 3rd-party providers (anti-spam and anti-virus offerings
only work with un-encrypted email, and in many cases the provider
also operates the entire mail store).
[and others also said: tls, dane, skype, smime, ca's, smtp, etc]
Medical, Financial
Nothing here changes, only the backend transport between nodes.
Once your node decrypts the message to your local system pipes,
you can do all this and more with it. Including running a 'business' node
and doing whatever you want with the plaintext after your node daemon
passes it to you. This is not about those ancient protocols. It's also
about 'messaging' not strictly 'email'... those lines are already well
blurred, no need to distinguish between them anymore. A 'light'
messaging client could simply ignore the non transport email headers,
or use your standard msg at nodekey address.
Please do not continue to talk about antique tradional centralized
systems in this thread, except of course to bash and route around them.
The speed of a real P2P/DHT replacement at scale is a research challenge.
this would make an interesting bet!  i too believe this to be
impossible given the constraints.
I'm not so sure about this, look at all the global resources being poured
into traditional email, and attempts to 'fix' it. Now redirect fractional 1%
of those resources and put them into a P2P replacement. That's ftw.
Say hello to Bote mail on I2P.
I2P provides encrypted anonymizing networking, Bote mail provides DHT
based serverless encrypted mailing with public crypto keys as
addresses (ECDSA or NTRU).
 and i2pbote.i2p (if you don't have I2P installed, add
.us to visit it via an inproxy).
There is also I2P Messenger that is encrypted P2P IM within I2P also
using public keys as addresses.
You may have a look of "I2P Bote" it is severless, encrypted mail
system, address is the public key, P2P based... nice tool.
  As in another post of mine, I'll be looking at that again.
My first take was that it stores the messages in the DHT,
which didn't seem scalable or reliable at all. I may be
wrong as I read more later.
I think that's working now. And is the general idea, create a strong
overlay network with a frontend MUA's can speak to.
As an aside: If you can make that overlay net present an IPv6 tunnel
interface on the local host, that lets you use any IPv6 enabled
app over it. I'm doubting the world needs a dozen application
specific overlay networks. More like just a few classes of network.
- message based store and forward
- low latency IPv6 transport
- data storage and retrieval
Bote mail doesn't have to be used for it's anonymous properties, for
me that is just a bonus. For many people it is more than enough to be
able to know that it is impossible for anybody else than the intended
recipient to read the message thanks to public key addressing.
Guaranteed end-to-end security if you can verify the address.
I don't think anything that doesn't fundamentally rely on public key
addressing is the (long term) future. There will inevitably issues
otherwise, including more issues of the type we have with CA:s today.
For those who want to make it more user friendly, nothing stops you
from adding a transparent "address translation layer" where servers
are involved. When you want to send a message to a person with a human
readable address at a server, then the server could then reply with
the public key based address to the mail client, and the user would
have the option to see what that address is. It could even be logged
by the client, with TOFU/POP style trust system that reduces the
amount of trust you have to place in the server. No need to trust
anybody with plaintext.
I suggest such interfacing with the current legacy system will only prolong
it's long past due extinction. Build a better system and let them come to you,
not the other way around. And bolting in exits will only make it harder to
do correctly and optimally what you need to do as a P2P system. Please,
just forget about interfacing with the legacy transport system. If you really
need that you can run your own p2p daemon node that acts as your
automated gateway between the two. This is mostly about design of
the p2p side, not that.
It is my understanding of the proposed replacement for email.  Magic
email addresses that in fact correspond to an identifier of a public
key, for example the hash of a rule that identifies the public key,
and which result in your message not in fact being passed along by
email protocols.
If you're not going to send directly to the very long account at nodepubkey, then
yes, you'll need to create another layer on top to hold your h(key). However,
the key must still be obtainable behind that since that is what the messages
will ultimately be encrypted and routed to. It's not much of a stretch beyond
that to ensure userland mail tools can handle say 8k long addresses. I'm not
against such a [vanity/shorthash] layer.
Bote mail and I2P messenger are two pieces of serverless software that
ALREADY is public key addressed within I2P. Have you tried them? You
need to add the public keys of the recipients to be able to send a
message to start with, although the DHT based search system Seedless
allow you to publish Bote mail addresses to the network.
(IMAP support for Bote mail is planned but not yet implemented, right
now it has a local web interface.)
Maybe Namecoin could work together with them to enable you to register
your key addresses to your nickname in a secure manner, but then you
still have to have a globally unique nickname and tell people the
exact spelling.
Though unclear, that sounds like the old trust of a CA/PKI system problem.
In general I suggest that people wish to use messaging with each other
once they already know them (or have some other trusted web to them).
As in, Hey John, nice to meet ya today, what's your key (address), I'll
message you later. Or Hey Jane, what's John's address. Same for
employers, businesses, etc. Such peer groups bootstrap and grow
very fast. Thus the perceived need for a cold lookup of Ralf, isn't much of
a real one.
Once you know the address (node crypto key), you put it 'To: ',
mua hands to spool, p2p daemon reads spool, looks up key in DHT and
sends msg off across the transport to the far key (node) when it is
reachable. Hopefully the transport looks like I2P/Tor in being a secure
random hop layer. In fact, those could probably be used today, they
have the keys as nodes and user facing ports for inbound/outbound
daemons. They just need scaling work to n-billion nodes (users,
aka: the hard part). People are already plugging postfix, bittorrent,
etc into these networks.
Tor is not currently addressible at the user level by the full key,
it 'shortens' the key into a 16char onion address. As you may be
hinting at... yes, that is bad... collisions, and needing secondary lookup
layers into the full key. Tor may be moving to full key addressibility
soon, see tor-dev for that.
I2P (and Phantom, and probably GnuNet) are addressible with full keys.
So you can send to 'account at key' with them if you want, and keep the
John/Jane/Ralf human style lookups in your MUA addressbook (once
you know them) without needing a secondary lookup layer into the full key.
No, I am not sure. But when looking at some of the p2p transport
layers that have come along so far, it seems like a fairly strong
possibility for a new backend transport model while retaining user
level mail tools... mutt, maildrop, mailman, Thunderbird, etc. Most
of what you'd need there is support for very long addresses and
split horizon handoff to local daemon/spool based on recognizing
what the destination net is... .onion, .i2p, etc.
I'd like to read what Pond and I2P-Bote are doing with some parts of
this as well.
I don't believe you need a trusted CA/PKI service to successfully
bootstrap users and their addresses/keys into a new global messaging
system. If I want to know what some unknown like Bruce's key is, I'll
look it up on his website, social net, list posts, etc. If that's what you
I feel like I walking in halfway into a conversation, I'm guessing this
started on the cryptography list that I'm not on.
Your DHT comment caught my attention though.  What in particular about
DHTs don't seem scalable or reliable?
Seems like DHTs are regularly in the 5-10M range and I don't see any
reason that DHTs couldn't be 10 times that.
Any reasonable churn rate and reliability could be handled with
replication.  The bit-torrent DHT for instance claims that 45% of users
that bootstrap from a central node are reachable 15 minutes later.  So
typical setups involve 8 nodes per bin, and 20 bins.  So every 15
minutes you ping 160 hosts, only reach 45%, and do some work to
repopulate the missing slots.
Given the simplicity of the bit-torrent DHT I think there's plenty of
room for improvement.  Larger routing tables are obvious (at the cost of
more network bandwidth to track peers).
The most promising idea for DHT improvements I've seen is to divide
peers into 3 latency groups.  High, medium, and low.   Much like L1
cache, L2 cache, and main memory.  That way common queries are very
fast, yet all queries still to find keys globally.
Bittorrent is already in the 100m node range. That's not enough. This
needs to replace every possible messaging user on the planet over
the duration of their actiive lifetime. That's at least a couple billion nodes.
Don't forget, you can always use disk to cache things.
But at the same time the system has to not say, "I can't deliver your
message to that person because an invisible gnotzaframmit that I won't
describe to you seems to be unavailable to me in the flabogrommit."
Address books as usual. Name layer if need be. We are humans, we
learn new lexicons, we write manuals, that part is nothing to be afraid of.
Being afraid only holds you back.
This is an interesting idea, because it provides certificates on
demand for ordinary users, if they decide to sign up to a certain
site. The
certs are then being used for other purposes, so the site does act as a
bootstap for using crypto. The one thing that this proposal relies on is
the availability of a common piece of software (user agent) that stores
the private key for the user. It's this part of the picture where things
get tricky.
There can be no non-distributed/redundant elements in this p2p system,
aka: no 'sites', certainly none with a realworld IP on them, and none where
very high percentages of them vanishing will disrupt the system for others.
This must replace email, therefore system disruption is intolerable.

@_subject: The next gen P2P secure email solution 
More summary pasting...
Encryption is only part of it. There's transport, elimination of
central storage, anonymity, p2p, etc. Many things people want
simply can't be done with modifications to the current system.
With p2p model and every node as a key/address, you don't
need 'pgp' because the node is the key and does lookups and
encrypt2dest / decrypt2you for you. But you can still use pgp with
the usual tools around message bodies if desired for additional
encrypt/auth or if you're disk isn't encrypted. P2P daemon
takes over and all the old transport headers go away.
Spam/AV becomes another local daemon. Mailing lists are
a repeater node someone runs, or the usual local mailman stuff.
It's a transport replacement, so business can use it account at node.
All the MTA's [connected directly to the internet] die off in time.

@_subject: [cryptography] The next gen P2P secure email solution 
I think this is one of many design choices to be made.
Extra bandwidth is hard to avoid, unless the topology is
point(sender)-to-point(recipient). Yet with that, there is no effort made
to hide who is physically talking to who. We want to try to defeat this
type of analysis, so we can't be simply point-to-point.
 ie: bittorrent and today's email are point-to-point, no multihop.
Next is storage (mix) vs. latency (tunnels). This seems less clear to
me when up against analysis. Filling circuits (tunnels) with chaff
seems interesting. And with deliverey directly to your recipient over
some tunnel circuit, you don't have to build in complex message redundancy
protocols (more storage float outstanding) to ensure your message 100%
gets there when 90% of the nodes go offline taking your stored message
with them. You also get direct realtime delivery confirmation too.
The question arises, how does one provide free anonymous transport
to those anons who simply can't pay because they are anon? How
do you 'get users' when the mentality is 'for free'? Bittorrent/Tor are
free and seem to work ok. Though it's also probably not unreasonable
to suggest (and harder to enforce) that you get 1:1 what resources you
donate to it. ie: I need to push 1GiB this month, so I need to provision at
minimum 1+Nx1GiB to do that... 1 for me, Nx1 for the net due to my use
(where N is some impact ratio inherent in the design of the net, such
as number hops.)

It is worth noting that Phantom does this natively without needing an overlay on
top of another net. It may also use disk to cache some network information, at
least their whitepaper says they are 'for' making that choice. Perhaps it can be
scaled?

I'd assume the design will rightly provide complete end2end encryption between
your source spool and your recipients spool over whatever bits are in between,
as a result of having the key, equivalent to the node, equivalent to
the address.
Store and forward might need to expose only the destination key to the storage
and routing net. A direct circuit would not.
All the legacy 'received' headers are gone by definition. A full raw message
might contain some required bits for continued use with your favorite mail tools
post handoff to you:
recipient. Since the net itself would seem to need to be anonymous, then it is
likely not. Nor is it a problem if it is... you just generate yourself
a new node if concerned.
To, Cc, Bcc
Antispam/antivirus becomes responsibility of the sender/recipient so no
headers there. No legacy dkim, spf, etc, either.
There may be a new set of transport preference headers if the design calls
for it. ie: You might be able to use the net with full mail clients
like mutt, thunderbird.
Or with a light 'messaging' client protocol. Each of which might have
a slightly different
interface into and out of the node.
Addresses might look like:
[user/function or protocol/arbitrary string] pubkey/hash]
I've no idea, only to see if interested people think some sort of nextgen
P2P/DHT system is actually possible at scale.

Tor is, in part, about freedom. And freedom is seriously
serious business, not some 'whatever'. Seriously.
So create some, and post it, anonymously or not. You have that
freedom. Whether a thousand word illustrated essay or boiled
down to a single image, there's no real difference.
The 'intelligent satire' above could be offensive to some. Maybe
these boiled down intelligent satirists are offensive to people too...
But you know, let's just decry and ban it all.

re: bitmail, goldbug, etc.
With all due respect, I doubt few here have or will anytime soon.
You spam out links to binaries no one's heard of, your source probably
isn't deterministic to your binaries, bsd/linux support?, your development
model doesn't appear open, code is hosted on a site few care about anymore,
you've no papers, presentations, mailing list or community involvement,
you've advertised the good name of other projects as being affiliated with
your work without their permission. And you've failed to address any of
this publicly despite people kindly prompting you to do so. In these
communities, that's a big red flag.
As always, full benefit of the doubt is given. If you need hosting for code,
lists, website... some code review, testing, etc... just ask an appropriate
list. We need more cool ideas and software... but you really need to step
up to the plate in these areas if you want people to take you seriously.

Afaik, skype used a central lookup to get to unknown peers, not a DHT.
So they perhaps knew who wanted to talk to who. Of course now skype
is untrusted by anyone with a clue.
Sure, there's a class of users that want this, a big class. They can
have and use their modified legacy centralized email as they wish.
There's another big class that want's something more than that.
We're also going to see faster hardware, lighter code, and maybe
even wearable battery packs... because as you say, these users
want it all and are willing to go to almost any means to get it.
There could also be ways to make the heavier weight anonymous
routing p2p transport let these lightweight clients stub in just to make a
direct p2p connection for encrypted voip/messaging (if say you
published your node as accepting that option).
We're exploring ideas. What is to say we are able to develop into it some
kind of automaton taho-lafs delivery storage nodes. Storing messages in
transit under some expiry policy is not a huge space concern. So who knows.
Maybe everyone with their uber important phones will end
up VPN to their home/colo servers where the horsepower is.
Predicting mobile is hard. Throw more apps out there and your
$30-50/mo unlimited data plans go away. Now is everyone going
to pay $150+/mo for that? Where is free open wifi going to end up
spanning? And so many other things.
What I think is clear is that there will for the far to indefinite forseeable
future be some form of real workstation/laptop in the home and office.
Phones just can't replace that. Maybe we're seeing something in how
you see larger tablet/netbooks/laptops with headsets being carried about
now as if it is natural. And lots of those people will want a highly
secure system to communicate over with their peers in this new
world of disgustingly gratuitous surveillance and databasing.
I would not underestimate the demand for that sort of a comms system.
That could be the multimodal thing above. Or the in network thing.
DSPAM, spamassassin, clamav and the like do fairly well enough
on their own locally.
I suggest not cataloging a defeatist list of what you think you can't
do... but rather what you could do, what you would gain and what
could happen if you build it :)
That's why you should be doing the development of these new
protocols entirely within existing secure networks such as Tor
and I2P. And why you should bootstrap via peers instead of
clearnet authorities like Tor that can be shutdown... it's a little
less secure, but you can have in network authorities wrapped
in web of trust and then rejoin listening only to them later. And
if clearnet get''s that bad, it becomes a freedom of speech issue
which is well, SHTF time.

In the context that Bitcoin needs an anonymizing layer to be anonymous,
yes, it's rather silly.
Abuse through the plain old internet is likely far more of a problem
regarding volume of tickets generated.
There is this
That's why you should only use services that send such
deposit defaults to established third party 'charities' you preselect
when creating your account. The Bitcoin blockchain could be
used to prove your default was sent to such third party by posting
the txid to your account that you are now otherwise locked from
using (at least until some future deposit/appeal is made). A service
provider that has this charity policy, cancels an account, and then
chooses to steal the money for themselves would quickly develop
a painfully public reputation issue.
Some say service providers really shouldn't cancel accounts except as
matter of Law, not their own policy whim, but that's another issue altogether.

John/Jane/Ralf human style lookups in your MUA addressbook (once
you know them) without needing a secondary lookup layer into the full key.
No, I am not sure. But when looking at some of the p2p transport
layers that have come along so far, it seems like a fairly strong
possibility for a new backend transport model while retaining user
level mail tools... mutt, maildrop, mailman, Thunderbird, etc. Most
of what you'd need there is support for very long addresses and
split horizon handoff to local daemon/spool based on recognizing
what the destination net is... .onion, .i2p, etc.
I'd like to read what Pond and I2P-Bote are doing with some parts of
this as well.
I don't believe you need a trusted CA/PKI service to successfully
bootstrap users and their addresses/keys into a new global messaging
system. If I want to know what some unknown like Bruce's key is, I'll

Everyone knows there are active attacks against
'Tor' users... ie: the apps they attach to it. Those are
cheap wins for the adversary and unrelated to Tor.
There are attempts to exploit Tor daemon and other various
access to 0wn or run the relays themselves to get at the
plaintext or the service running behind Tor. Not much
to do there but harden Tor and the relays and run more
independant ones. And nobody's cracking the crypto on
the wire anytime soon. Those aren't really related to
Tor, but standard practice.
Tor can have it's hidden services found via various
published attacks involving deploying analysis nodes.
There are caveats, and the cost isn't that much, but
it takes time. It's in the papers.
I'd caution on one debated thing about adversaries... we know
there are at least a few adversaries in the world that have *very*
good regional coverage with network taps. So contrary
to some opinions, I'd suggest it would be rather possible for them
to use those and determine who is talking to who by correlating
traffic passing the taps... if your traffic happened to begin and
end within that region it could be game over. That's in the
papers too.
Low latency nets that do not use fill traffic are simply
not resistant to timing/correlation attacks. Tor is low latency
and does not use fill traffic. It's not a break, it's a design
choice/tradeoff. Depending on how you use these networks,
it may or may not be an issue for you.
Tor was never meant to do everything, yet it's quite good
at what it does, and publishing what it doesn't.

@_subject: The next gen P2P secure email solution 
This thread pertains specifically to the use of P2P/DHT models
to replace traditional email as we know it today. There was
a former similarly named thread on this that diverged... from the
concept and challenge of P2P/DHT handling the transport and
lookups... back to more traditional models. This thread does not
care about those antique models, please do not take it there.
In short, we're attempting to examine and develop some form
of new transport that looks somewhat like a mix between secure
anonymous networks, string at pubkey node addressing, massive
decentralized dht-like scaling and finally a user facing daemon that
moves messages into and out of local spools for use by normal
user/system tools.
Pasting in a very rough and unflowing thread summary to date
for interested people to pick up and discuss, draft, etc.
How many times has this been rehashed the last six months?
You can't fix email as we know it today using todays bolt-ons,
protocols and corporate stakeholders/services trying to profit from it.
The only way to have any real global seamless success is to go
ground up with a completely new model. IMO, that will be some
form of p2p message system where every address is a crypto key,
masked for grandma by her contact list, decrypted out your p2p
daemon and piped into your local mail processing (MUA/filter/lists)
and filesystem (encryption). At least that way your local mail tools
will still work (no one will give those up anyway).
The problem is the antique centralized backend, it needs bypassed.
You've got neat stuff like Tor, bittorrent, bitcoin, etc already... so
boost email into the 2020's the same way. Then let the old world
email services try to keep up, and slowly die like everything else.
Obviously. It will never be able to escape the non-body
header content and third party routing, storage and analysis with
any form of patching over today's mail. And it's completely
ridiculous that people continue to invest [aka: waste] effort in
'securing' it. The best you'll ever get clients down to is exposing
a single 'To:' header within an antique transport model that
forces you to authenticate to it in order to despam, bill, censor
and control you.
That system is cooked, done and properly fucked. Abandon it.
What the world needs now is a real peer to peer messaging
system that scales. Take Tor for a partial example... so long
as all the sender/recipient nodes [onions] are up, any message
you send will get through, encrypted, in real time. If a recipient
is not up, you queue it locally till they are... no third party ever
needed, and you get lossless delivery and confirmation for free.
Unmemorable node address?, quit crying and make use of your
local address book. Doesn't have plugins for current clients?,
so what, write some and use it if you're dumb enough to mix
the old and new mail.
The only real problem that still needs solved is scalability...
what p2p node lookup systems are out there that will handle
a messaging world's population worth of nodes [billions] and
their keys and tertiary data? If you can do that, you should
be able to get some anon transport over the p2p for free.
Anyway, p2p messaging and anonymous transports have
all been dreamed up by others before. But now is the
time to actually abandon traditional email and just do it.
If you build it, they will come.
I'm strongly against most the ideas to abbandon current email systems,
because the results will be to create wallet garden.
We need something interoperable with existing systems or the system will
just be used by a bunch of paranoid people or fostered by the marketing
of few cryptography company acquiring customers, not user.
It would be interoperable with current end user interfaces/tools, but not
directly with you at some.dotcom.
As with everything else, today's seeds grow into tomorrows garden, sometimes
you just have to thorougly plow under last year's chaff first, that's by design.
E-mail is basically business correspondence.
    - E-mail is stored.
    - E-mail is sent to many people outside your personal social network.
    - Business recipients of email are often subject to corporate and/or
      regulatory policy constraints that are in conflict with end-to-end
      encryption.
The above list of features can be greatly expanded, and the
consequences elaborated, but I doubt may on this list truly need
to be re-educated about email.
So I will confidently predict that end-to-end secure email will
remain a niche service used by a tiny minority.
Even businesses that one might expect to implement at least encryption
to the "gateway", are in many cases choosing to out-source their
gateway to 3rd-party providers (anti-spam and anti-virus offerings
only work with un-encrypted email, and in many cases the provider
also operates the entire mail store).
[and others also said: tls, dane, skype, smime, ca's, smtp, etc]
Medical, Financial
Nothing here changes, only the backend transport between nodes.
Once your node decrypts the message to your local system pipes,
you can do all this and more with it. Including running a 'business' node
and doing whatever you want with the plaintext after your node daemon
passes it to you. This is not about those ancient protocols. It's also
about 'messaging' not strictly 'email'... those lines are already well
blurred, no need to distinguish between them anymore. A 'light'
messaging client could simply ignore the non transport email headers,
or use your standard msg at nodekey address.
Please do not continue to talk about antique tradional centralized
systems in this thread, except of course to bash and route around them.
The speed of a real P2P/DHT replacement at scale is a research challenge.
this would make an interesting bet!  i too believe this to be
impossible given the constraints.
I'm not so sure about this, look at all the global resources being poured
into traditional email, and attempts to 'fix' it. Now redirect fractional 1%
of those resources and put them into a P2P replacement. That's ftw.
Say hello to Bote mail on I2P.
I2P provides encrypted anonymizing networking, Bote mail provides DHT
based serverless encrypted mailing with public crypto keys as
addresses (ECDSA or NTRU).
 and i2pbote.i2p (if you don't have I2P installed, add
.us to visit it via an inproxy).
There is also I2P Messenger that is encrypted P2P IM within I2P also
using public keys as addresses.
You may have a look of "I2P Bote" it is severless, encrypted mail
system, address is the public key, P2P based... nice tool.
  As in another post of mine, I'll be looking at that again.
My first take was that it stores the messages in the DHT,
which didn't seem scalable or reliable at all. I may be
wrong as I read more later.
I think that's working now. And is the general idea, create a strong
overlay network with a frontend MUA's can speak to.
As an aside: If you can make that overlay net present an IPv6 tunnel

app over it. I'm doubting the world needs a dozen application
specific overlay networks. More like just a few classes of network.
- message based store and forward
- low latency IPv6 transport
- data storage and retrieval
Bote mail doesn't have to be used for it's anonymous properties, for
me that is just a bonus. For many people it is more than enough to be
able to know that it is impossible for anybody else than the intended
recipient to read the message thanks to public key addressing.
Guaranteed end-to-end security if you can verify the address.
I don't think anything that doesn't fundamentally rely on public key
addressing is the (long term) future. There will inevitably issues
otherwise, including more issues of the type we have with CA:s today.
For those who want to make it more user friendly, nothing stops you
from adding a transparent "address translation layer" where servers
are involved. When you want to send a message to a person with a human
readable address at a server, then the server could then reply with
the public key based address to the mail client, and the user would
have the option to see what that address is. It could even be logged
by the client, with TOFU/POP style trust system that reduces the
amount of trust you have to place in the server. No need to trust
anybody with plaintext.
I suggest such interfacing with the current legacy system will only prolong
it's long past due extinction. Build a better system and let them come to you,
not the other way around. And bolting in exits will only make it harder to
do correctly and optimally what you need to do as a P2P system. Please,
just forget about interfacing with the legacy transport system. If you really
need that you can run your own p2p daemon node that acts as your
automated gateway between the two. This is mostly about design of
the p2p side, not that.
It is my understanding of the proposed replacement for email.  Magic
email addresses that in fact correspond to an identifier of a public
key, for example the hash of a rule that identifies the public key,
and which result in your message not in fact being passed along by
email protocols.
If you're not going to send directly to the very long account at nodepubkey, then
yes, you'll need to create another layer on top to hold your h(key). However,
the key must still be obtainable behind that since that is what the messages
will ultimately be encrypted and routed to. It's not much of a stretch beyond
that to ensure userland mail tools can handle say 8k long addresses. I'm not
against such a [vanity/shorthash] layer.
Bote mail and I2P messenger are two pieces of serverless software that
ALREADY is public key addressed within I2P. Have you tried them? You
need to add the public keys of the recipients to be able to send a
message to start with, although the DHT based search system Seedless
allow you to publish Bote mail addresses to the network.
(IMAP support for Bote mail is planned but not yet implemented, right
now it has a local web interface.)
Maybe Namecoin could work together with them to enable you to register
your key addresses to your nickname in a secure manner, but then you
still have to have a globally unique nickname and tell people the
exact spelling.
Though unclear, that sounds like the old trust of a CA/PKI system problem.
In general I suggest that people wish to use messaging with each other
once they already know them (or have some other trusted web to them).
As in, Hey John, nice to meet ya today, what's your key (address), I'll
message you later. Or Hey Jane, what's John's address. Same for
employers, businesses, etc. Such peer groups bootstrap and grow
very fast. Thus the perceived need for a cold lookup of Ralf, isn't much of
a real one.
Once you know the address (node crypto key), you put it 'To: ',
mua hands to spool, p2p daemon reads spool, looks up key in DHT and
sends msg off across the transport to the far key (node) when it is
reachable. Hopefully the transport looks like I2P/Tor in being a secure
random hop layer. In fact, those could probably be used today, they
have the keys as nodes and user facing ports for inbound/outbound
daemons. They just need scaling work to n-billion nodes (users,
aka: the hard part). People are already plugging postfix, bittorrent,
etc into these networks.
Tor is not currently addressible at the user level by the full key,
it 'shortens' the key into a 16char onion address. As you may be
hinting at... yes, that is bad... collisions, and needing secondary lookup
layers into the full key. Tor may be moving to full key addressibility
soon, see tor-dev for that.
I2P (and Phantom, and probably GnuNet) are addressible with full keys.
So you can send to 'account at key' with them if you want, and keep the
John/Jane/Ralf human style lookups in your MUA addressbook (once
you know them) without needing a secondary lookup layer into the full key.
No, I am not sure. But when looking at some of the p2p transport
layers that have come along so far, it seems like a fairly strong
possibility for a new backend transport model while retaining user
level mail tools... mutt, maildrop, mailman, Thunderbird, etc. Most
of what you'd need there is support for very long addresses and
split horizon handoff to local daemon/spool based on recognizing
what the destination net is... .onion, .i2p, etc.
I'd like to read what Pond and I2P-Bote are doing with some parts of
this as well.
I don't believe you need a trusted CA/PKI service to successfully
bootstrap users and their addresses/keys into a new global messaging
system. If I want to know what some unknown like Bruce's key is, I'll
look it up on his website, social net, list posts, etc. If that's what you
I feel like I walking in halfway into a conversation, I'm guessing this
started on the cryptography list that I'm not on.
Your DHT comment caught my attention though.  What in particular about
DHTs don't seem scalable or reliable?
Seems like DHTs are regularly in the 5-10M range and I don't see any
reason that DHTs couldn't be 10 times that.
Any reasonable churn rate and reliability could be handled with
replication.  The bit-torrent DHT for instance claims that 45% of users
that bootstrap from a central node are reachable 15 minutes later.  So
typical setups involve 8 nodes per bin, and 20 bins.  So every 15
minutes you ping 160 hosts, only reach 45%, and do some work to
repopulate the missing slots.
Given the simplicity of the bit-torrent DHT I think there's plenty of
room for improvement.  Larger routing tables are obvious (at the cost of
more network bandwidth to track peers).
The most promising idea for DHT improvements I've seen is to divide
peers into 3 latency groups.  High, medium, and low.   Much like L1
cache, L2 cache, and main memory.  That way common queries are very
fast, yet all queries still to find keys globally.
Bittorrent is already in the 100m node range. That's not enough. This
needs to replace every possible messaging user on the planet over
the duration of their actiive lifetime. That's at least a couple billion nodes.
Don't forget, you can always use disk to cache things.
But at the same time the system has to not say, "I can't deliver your
message to that person because an invisible gnotzaframmit that I won't
describe to you seems to be unavailable to me in the flabogrommit."
Address books as usual. Name layer if need be. We are humans, we
learn new lexicons, we write manuals, that part is nothing to be afraid of.
Being afraid only holds you back.
This is an interesting idea, because it provides certificates on
demand for ordinary users, if they decide to sign up to a certain
site. The
certs are then being used for other purposes, so the site does act as a
bootstap for using crypto. The one thing that this proposal relies on is
the availability of a common piece of software (user agent) that stores
the private key for the user. It's this part of the picture where things
get tricky.
There can be no non-distributed/redundant elements in this p2p system,
aka: no 'sites', certainly none with a realworld IP on them, and none where
very high percentages of them vanishing will disrupt the system for others.
This must replace email, therefore system disruption is intolerable.

More summary pasting...
Encryption is only part of it. There's transport, elimination of
central storage, anonymity, p2p, etc. Many things people want
simply can't be done with modifications to the current system.
With p2p model and every node as a key/address, you don't
need 'pgp' because the node is the key and does lookups and
encrypt2dest / decrypt2you for you. But you can still use pgp with
the usual tools around message bodies if desired for additional
encrypt/auth or if you're disk isn't encrypted. P2P daemon
takes over and all the old transport headers go away.
Spam/AV becomes another local daemon. Mailing lists are
a repeater node someone runs, or the usual local mailman stuff.
It's a transport replacement, so business can use it account at node.
All the MTA's [connected directly to the internet] die off in time.

@_subject: [cryptography] The next gen P2P secure email solution 
I think this is one of many design choices to be made.
Extra bandwidth is hard to avoid, unless the topology is
point(sender)-to-point(recipient). Yet with that, there is no effort made
to hide who is physically talking to who. We want to try to defeat this
type of analysis, so we can't be simply point-to-point.
 ie: bittorrent and today's email are point-to-point, no multihop.
Next is storage (mix) vs. latency (tunnels). This seems less clear to
me when up against analysis. Filling circuits (tunnels) with chaff
seems interesting. And with deliverey directly to your recipient over
some tunnel circuit, you don't have to build in complex message redundancy
protocols (more storage float outstanding) to ensure your message 100%
gets there when 90% of the nodes go offline taking your stored message
with them. You also get direct realtime delivery confirmation too.
The question arises, how does one provide free anonymous transport
to those anons who simply can't pay because they are anon? How
do you 'get users' when the mentality is 'for free'? Bittorrent/Tor are
free and seem to work ok. Though it's also probably not unreasonable
to suggest (and harder to enforce) that you get 1:1 what resources you
donate to it. ie: I need to push 1GiB this month, so I need to provision at
minimum 1+Nx1GiB to do that... 1 for me, Nx1 for the net due to my use
(where N is some impact ratio inherent in the design of the net, such
as number hops.)

top of another net. It may also use disk to cache some network information, at

I'd assume the design will rightly provide complete end2end encryption between
your source spool and your recipients spool over whatever bits are in between,
as a result of having the key, equivalent to the node, equivalent to
the address.
Store and forward might need to expose only the destination key to the storage
and routing net. A direct circuit would not.
All the legacy 'received' headers are gone by definition. A full raw message
might contain some required bits for continued use with your favorite mail tools
post handoff to you:
recipient. Since the net itself would seem to need to be anonymous, then it is
likely not. Nor is it a problem if it is... you just generate yourself
a new node if concerned.
To, Cc, Bcc
Antispam/antivirus becomes responsibility of the sender/recipient so no
headers there. No legacy dkim, spf, etc, either.
There may be a new set of transport preference headers if the design calls
for it. ie: You might be able to use the net with full mail clients
like mutt, thunderbird.
Or with a light 'messaging' client protocol. Each of which might have
a slightly different
interface into and out of the node.
Addresses might look like:
[user/function or protocol/arbitrary string] pubkey/hash]
I've no idea, only to see if interested people think some sort of nextgen
P2P/DHT system is actually possible at scale.

Afaik, skype used a central lookup to get to unknown peers, not a DHT.
So they perhaps knew who wanted to talk to who. Of course now skype

Sure, there's a class of users that want this, a big class. They can

There's another big class that want's something more than that.
We're also going to see faster hardware, lighter code, and maybe

want it all and are willing to go to almost any means to get it.
There could also be ways to make the heavier weight anonymous

transit under some expiry policy is not a huge space concern. So who knows.
Maybe everyone with their uber important phones will end
up VPN to their home/colo servers where the horsepower is.
Predicting mobile is hard. Throw more apps out there and your
$30-50/mo unlimited data plans go away. Now is everyone going
to pay $150+/mo for that? Where is free open wifi going to end up
spanning? And so many other things.
What I think is clear is that there will for the far to indefinite forseeable
future be some form of real workstation/laptop in the home and office.
Phones just can't replace that. Maybe we're seeing something in how
you see larger tablet/netbooks/laptops with headsets being carried about
now as if it is natural. And lots of those people will want a highly
secure system to communicate over with their peers in this new
world of disgustingly gratuitous surveillance and databasing.
I would not underestimate the demand for that sort of a comms system.
That could be the multimodal thing above. Or the in network thing.
DSPAM, spamassassin, clamav and the like do fairly well enough
on their own locally.
I suggest not cataloging a defeatist list of what you think you can't
do... but rather what you could do, what you would gain and what
could happen if you build it :)
That's why you should be doing the development of these new
protocols entirely within existing secure networks such as Tor
and I2P. And why you should bootstrap via peers instead of
clearnet authorities like Tor that can be shutdown... it's a little
less secure, but you can have in network authorities wrapped
in web of trust and then rejoin listening only to them later. And
if clearnet get''s that bad, it becomes a freedom of speech issue
which is well, SHTF time.
