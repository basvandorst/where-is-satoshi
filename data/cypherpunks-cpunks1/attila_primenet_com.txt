Markoff is not the best on criticism. write the editor direct.
                       ----------------------------------
   Microsoft particularly does seem to place a death grip on things, but
more industry consortiums are forming and Billy has been required to accept
the heat; Java is one, except Billy always finds a way to subvert the
process. Billy is like Karl Marx' premise: "sign all treaties; break them when it is convenient."
   The conundrum is trying to decide "when" a particular company is a monopoly by either the classic definition of the Sherman and Clayton Acts or an effective monopoly, or "bad" player as defined in the Robinson-Patman act.     Bill Gates more than satisfies the requirements of defining a monopoly
in Sherman and Clayton with 85% of the desktop locked in and an assualt
with "almost" standards on the open-system server market. NT is already
garnering more than 25% of server installations in business --big
business, since it will be "guaranteed" compatible with their desktop 95s. The rest of us, stay with the real thing.
    Add to MS' virtually absolute domination of the desktop and its impending domination of the commercial servers the fact that MS has 95% of the front line office products --WP, Spreadsheet, Database, and mail with the last be non-standard to long established rules and you do have a problem to be considered.     Will the market correct itself?  Very questionable since MS rode to its position on IBM's back and capitalized on IBM's failure to recognize what they had stumbled into. IBM did not fall by the market rejecting IBM --the market exploded with the PC for price and diversity reasons: you can not compare direct entry, full screen aplications and transportability of a PC against a looped, expensive main-frame connection, if the boss even approves the cost.
    However, Bill Gates' more serious offense involves the fair trade
provisions of the Robinson-Patman act and the subsequent fine-tuning of
the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) which has its own courts. Bill Gates
has used his operating system dominance to force hardware vendors to ship
MS products on _every_ machine, or pay substantial penalties in rates 2
and 3 times larger for all MS products --cheap only if it is universal. Under these conditions, why would they ship OS/2 or UNIX? Add a few more
of his contractural items and Anne Bingaman was correct in charging Bill
with restraint of trade.    The real issue in DOJ v. MS was that although Bill complied with a consent decree, he _immediatley_ found other ways to apply the screw, and many of these newer terms are even worse, but more subtle. And, there is no question the verbal threats have been significantly worse. To software vendors it is the threat of denial of technical information on GUIs and APIs, to hardware manufacturers it is threats of ecomnomic sanctions, including publishing decertification of the platform for various WIN95 and NT compliant stickers, etc.
    Bill Gates is NOT an ethical businessman. If the fact was that Bill
was able to garner his position from hard work, a better product, and a
well-greased advertising and marketing organization would not justify the
application of the classic Sherman and Clayton anti-trust rules; the
market will either continue to accept them or not.     However, Bill has used his position of 85% in OSs not only to dictate OS considerations, as bad as they are with DOS nothing more than a boot sector virus and Windows a pretty program loader, but he has used this position to dominate the applications market by bundling and forcing machine integrators to include the MicroSoft applications in return for the OEM discount on the operating systems.      Preloading the market by those means is _not_ ethical or good
business. Bill Gates _clearly_ violates the FTC provisons on ethical
conduct and restraint of trade by a monopoly or quasi-monopoly position. Why were nearly 30 OEMs represented anonymously in "friend of the court"
briefs? --and the first thing Billy's (hired virtually every high end firm
in SF) attorneys' did was subpoena the _names_ of the consortium under the
rules of evidence --welcome to the "Kiss of Death."     Personally, I think it is time to dismember Bill Gates --give him a
choice of his OS group or his applications group and literally force him
to sell all direct or indirect interest in the one he does not choose,
plus forego any involvement.    An example of the "ill" is Gate's clear announcement that _all_ MS
programs would now be geared to direct interface to the internet --again
initially only the Microsft Network with proprietary standards.  This may
be commendable on the intended results of better integration to the world,
but not in terms of free trade as _everything_ MS does is proprietary, or
they do not release _correct_ API information until they have taken a
commanding lead in the market (witness Compu$erve and the rest on no
access to Win95 --IBM put their network and a button for other networks,
with a working PPP interfacein the same folder).     Anyone who thinks Bill Gates or Microsoft is a benevolent 800 pound gorilla has not paid attention in history classes:

    both Blaze and Weinstein are bound by their employment contracts from     discussing political hot-potatoes. Weinstein did state rather   emphatically the opinions of the crew at Netscape did not conform to
  the apparently misguided statements of the dupe of government.
    blaze has sent plenty of code our way --even obtaining permission from

  crypto and kernels ? - I have.
    Did I ever break into systems or alter data --no, that's not ethical.
    Could I? -yes, presumably some.
    "Membership" in Cypherpunks is not predicated on supporting _your_
  political agenda or beliefs. In fact, too much bandwidth is expended
  on arguing about political policy. I agree with Perry that postings   should be crypto design and implementation.     I have suggested that even announcements of crypto political
  activities should be put up like John Young posts: one paragraph
  synopsis and a reference to get the whole thing, but no discussion   --take it elsewhere.
    As for the attacks on Perry, they are inexcusable. You obviously   have no idea what crypto Perry codes.
    I have not published crypto code for a long time.  I am wrapping up,   after a _long_ hiatus, one which will really take their socks off --with
  their shoes still on.  I'd love to release it to public domain, but____
    What am I going to do with it? dunno, probably put the tape on the   shelf; I escaped the hard hand of justice, a poor man, the last time   when I tried to enter the code in evidence. Now I am "20 years older and
  deeper in debt" [Tennessee Ernie style]; is it worth it? I've done my
  time, and code has a signature. I think I would prefer to enjoy my five
  children and a few grandchildren. But it has been a good exercise....
    No, Mr. ECafe Anonymous _chicken_, you're the despicable party. Put   your imprint on your attacks and accusations: the Constitution says you   are entitled to _face_ your accusers.
    If you want to argue about constitutional or God given rights --do it in   other forums. If you want to denigrate blaze, weinstein, perry, and maybe   even tcmay, just drop yourself off the cpunk mailing list.
    meanwhile, get out of our collective faces and let us do a little   code, I intend to finish my work, and then I can have a depression

@_subject: e$: Mandarins, Lifers, and Talents 
one point to add to the discussion of pioneers, "evangelists" and "prophets" in this thread:
   1.  they were all ahead of the curve --yes, they were visionaries.        almost all were pushed aside as it became a "business."
   2.  most were pioneers: a specific example is Bob Norris who walked
       out of a Fairchild board meeting being being rejected for his        eighth try at replacing Germanium because the first seven had
       failed. A couple of VCs, among them Arthur Rock and Bob Perring
       said: "...we believe you, let's try silicon..." and we have Intel.         But, who drives Intel today? --Grove, who is labelled as the
       founder.  Grove made the _business_ -the brains have been        forgotten. Norris was the darling of the VCs for a couple years
       until they figured he couldn't spot a _financial_ success.
This same scenario was repeated at Apple, and hundreds of others. Grove
was an exception to the rule that the startup management, quite often
including developers, is replaced by plain vanilla suits. Why even the
evangalistic and prophetical developers?  --because they don't deviate
from their vision to comply with the soley profit oriented modes of the
new marketeers. I look at it this way: our nation runs on _money_, whether we like it or not (I don't). Money for the sake of money is evil money as it gives nothing in return, particularly when everything is to be produced as cheaply as possible for more profit to the money folks.
Reminds of two excellent quotes from John Ruskin:
 "He who buys for price alone is this man's lawful prey."
 "The price of oats is significantly lower after processing by the horse." I write code because I enjoy it -even it is addictive.

@_subject: Corrections about Bob Noyce and Intel 
you are probably correct, I did not follow the actual technology. I
    do know that from the financial point of view, there had been too many
    failures to justify another large project --yes, that could have been
    the silicon-gate MOS theory.  But there certainly was a parting of the
    ways over funding, to the probable good of the industry since
    Fairchild was already very stodgy. You do need a new, ambitious     venture to exploit a new technology --one with a single goal, and
    Intel certainly was that vehicle.     The closest I got to Fairchild Semiconductor was when I was consulting
    as a hatchet man to "save" another, newly acquired, Fairchild division
    which had a desparate need for 100K ECL parts which were not really     on the market in 1977.  The labs in the old building 2 were in pitiful     shape, and that is where 100K ECL had been ostracized --the new
    division's product was hot on the list of then current Fairchild
    president, Cronin, who suffered through my presenation of why I     needed $1M plus the 100K lab and fab upgraded --funding for both was
    the same day, not the usual 3-6 months.  Nice corporate jet at the
    time.... :)  and, yes, both projects were _very_ successful.
    Grove _was_ a technologist, but his current competitive tactics may     have been the tutor for Bill Gates  --or is the other way around? :)
    since Bill is the most effective and feared, even by government, of
    competition by terror tactics ever seen --beats even Cornelius
    Vanderbilt who tried to contain Edison so his gas businesses would not
    suffer --CB _financed_ Edison and then tried to block Edison --who
    then essentially gave NYC the downtown power station, building it in     defiance of CB.
    But, even if Edison was the inventor, he was not a visionary: he had
    Tesla, who already had an AC motor, in his employ in the 1880s; they
    parted as Edison would not budge off DC and Tesla sold his AC     Techology to George Westinghouse who had a great deal of money from
    his air brakes.  When Tesla received the Niagra Fall power generator
    contract, DC was history and the huge generators Tesla designed are
    still running at the base of the falls --90+ years!     The same analysis can be applied to to Bob Noyce v. Andrew Grove     --Andrew Grove may have been an engineer, but he also became a     visionary, as did Bill Gates.
    I have not seen, or had the pleasure of seeing, Gordon Moore for at     least 10 years. Yes, he is a technologist; AND, he is a gentleman.     I do not know Craig Barrett.  A Barrett presidency may change Intel's
    voracious competitiveness, or it may not.      your history is generally better than mine, Tim, but I will differ on     that point. in the 70s and 80s I was consulting to 3-7 of the heavy     players at that time in the Sandhill group plus the old guard     downtown on high-tech ventures --I always figured I would get the call
    when their fear exceeded their greed.  :) (and so stated by one of
    their own).     you may be correct that Bob Noyce hit a couple of winners, but,     overall he did just the opposite. as two of the heavies stated over
    lunch one day, "...having Bob Noyce's recommendation became the kiss     of death in this town..."      Now, granted, the VCs have their own point of view of what a     financial success is --after all, they base their views on an
    investment strategy for 10 deals:  1 real winner (not necessarily a     NetScape or an Intel, but at least go public with a bang), 3 make
    decent profit, 3 investment returned (or most of it), and 3 dead, or
    close to dead, losses.     My objection to the VC financing strategy was that they also took
    personal notes from the startup team and selectively enforced them,
    usually on the pioneers and not the president and comptroller they
    installed as part of the deal; and they have been known to take     homes....     Today's VC is a far cry from John D. Rockefeller who was vilified in
    his day for his business practices --John D. took 10%, not 51% or more
    plus personal notes.     BTW, John D. was the first "big" anti-trust case in the U.S. Ohio     drove him out of cleveland to NJ with their anti-trust actions in     1890 (or thereabouts) and the U.S. under Teddy "Rough Rider" Roosevelt

@_subject: Design proposal: crypto-capable generic interface 
_anything_ that has open access on a piece of hardware is a point
     of intrustion --sendmail for instance, or open password files, etc.      the issue is trading off risks to _maximize_ security and      impenatrable access.
        even assuming we were to post 100% of the source code, a
     translation daemon is a _translation_ model --even if it is capable
     of translating pgp, garbage in equals nothing out...
        one of the biggest problems with _any_ crypto system, and pgp is      no exception, is tmp files, followed closely by insecure memory.
     insecure memory is a separate issue, but some of the temporary file
     problems can be relegated to reduced risk by passing the daemon the
     user's preferred location for tmp file --for instance, on any net
     access machine, I globally specify TMP, TEMP, etc to a local tmp
     directory which is at least somewhat safer than public tmp files.
     obviously, you expect the daemon to wipe clean each memory block      before it free()s it --I's sure we all have routines handy for that.
        presuming the daemon is constructed so it can only respond to its
     current process owner, this leaves the security problem of swapping      in a daemon which also responds to an interloper --and this same risk
     applies to a libppg or a .dll file (more so to a .dll file) to an      even greater degree.  However, if a daemon is swapped, the system has
     a more _serious_ problem with the system administrator, not the
     daemon.
        if the IPC strings are intercepted in the daemon initializtion,      again we have a basic hardware and system security problem.
     Even If Ralph Levian believes daemons are serious risk problems      (which they can be if not properly implemented), I do not agree that      the libppg() or .dll offer anything additional.  I dont presume to      believe that anything is safe anyway, just safer than the alter-
     native.
        NB:  _nothing_ should ever be assumed secure!              assumption is fuckup's mother.          one must hope to have considered every possible line of attack,      and a few which have not been conceived, which goes back to our
     cypherpunk "credo" which says that private standards are not safe
     --let's all have at it --even if we break it, there probably is a way
     to block the attack, we just did not block it or consider it the
     first time,
        I have been playing with all three approaches, and I keep going      back to the daemon despite the fact it is not portable to the brain
     dead.              I don't know if W95 permits daemons as I have ignored MS
             for a number of years --if I can not run as many processes
             as I want without some MickeySoft program blowing away a
             day's work.... I prsume NT will run 'em, and maybe the              next release of NT will be more useable, more secure, and
             more stable.
        Since pgp() has been pulled from crypto10, I need to modularize      pgp to a pgp() and include the relevant goodies such as MIME and its      variations.  And, of course, we need all the "we do it here" types to
     buy into a standard interface.
        And, to add fuel:  the module needs the ability to encode and      place clear text into a MIME format specified by the calling program.
     think it would be easy enough to sell IAPs on a daemon.

attila->
    the daemon, in and off itself, is not dangerous -it becomes critical
if it is accessible via the port number tables. the problem with a user
invoked slave process via a socket mechanism is the same as with a .dll or
likable library: the application need to determine the authenticty of the
single application socket"     the system wide multi-process daemon has an advantage in one respect: it
can only be loaded by the administrator, and as long as each invocation declares (and wipes at exit) its one memory allocation, including any pseudo-static variables --keep in mind that it must not be tied to the external tables.  Therefore, in order to not be passing keys, passphrase, and all that good stuff across a lan, the daemon must be able to verify that the caller is literally local.  This works even on diskless workstations as long as they have sufficient memory to support the application and the processes are specified non-swappable.
 <-attila
     the temptation here is to use plugins to reduce the load
component.  Again, you have the problem of tampered linkable libraries or
.dlls.  Secondly, the problem with diskless workstations rears up, again
--the diskless workstations must obtain their loadable modules from the
LAN/WAN unless RAM is infinite and everything is preloaded --except, hear
comes the LAN/WAN again before load.     of course, both the basic daemon and all the loadable plugins can an
also be encrypted with the header containing at least lateral and linear checksums, if not polynomial check subroutines for authentication. in both cases, the base daemon must verify the authenticity which means it needs a system manager modifiable list table.
    the use of public/private key pairs which can me modified for each
sight by a system manager with either a special routine or a debugger,
provides an additional level of security.     although you could enable a similar service between the daemon and the calling module using DH for each "session," thereby making it even harder for an interloper to monitor any IPC connections, even if LAN/WAN usage was permitted under these conditions --just how far do you want or need to push the limits of "secure."  I'll answer that the usual way for anyone who has written code, let alone secure code or crypto --to the max --better snooping tools are alway around the corner (it's just like the arms race).  --and, there is always the wrapper approach on top of this.
     No, that is not is not always true; again, user space
sockets present the same security risk as loadable modules unless you have
a base socket which decrypts and authenticates each loadable module. And, user sockets are more easily attacked.
     in order for a "user" to decrypt public key paired messages,
the users private key must be passed to the daemon --obviously in a secure
packet which again can be initiated with DH; the alternative is a lookup
from a standardized location such as ~/.private/ring which can be
non-readable except by the owner or by the daemon running suid as the user
at the authentication level.     Personally, I would rather pass the private key from the user module
intereface in an authentication packet and not have it necessarily visible
--the same goes for the pass phrase.     this checking and rechecking may be necessary for maximum security on a multi-user machine, but you may have more authentication overhead than translation overhead in a short packet...
    and, what do you do with MickeySoft?  with as much 3.1 base code as there appears to be from the complaints, W95 looks like a problem for multi-process packetizing, etc. Maybe NT is better?  I do not use either and will stay with some form of BSD (Solaris and FreeBSD currently). I may be the last holdout on earth as the posting yesterday detailed, but I will be a holdout.
     there is nothing that says you can not use a 64 or 128 bit
public key; nothing says you must use 1024 bits for the public. the fact
the private key is 1024 bits is irrelevant other than the fact it
increases security. there are some advantages of simplicity for
simplicity's sake! :)

pass if you are a member, but no one should be discriminated agains
membership --no politics, not even the alerts which we really should be
aware of as public "policy" (if you can call it that) does concern how we
approach crypto in general. sci.crypt.research is a little more techinical
that it needs to be and rarely has the give and take we have in this list
--particularly when we are kicking around a proposal (like the universal translator of this thread.
    I would suggest that the code arguments be cross posted to the current list.  we might find some interesting political considerations may lead to proposals for code.
    The problem is the the moderator --who has the time? If not John Gilmore, maybe TCM???     I have more or less retired from active consulting and would do it if
I were not overcommitted including some travel for the next several months
--I do have a fast notebook, but toll charges are a bitch.  It is
important that there is "moderation" which blows away ideas despite
personal bias and preference.     One possible way to set the moderated list is to post as we always have to cypherpunks, and the moderator pops all the code related postings over to cypherpunks.moderated at toad.com (or whereever). This means the main list is complete, with the moderated list code limited. Once a message thread is identified, procmail would pick up the thread and forward it. .procmailrc commands could be handled automatically with a small script.
    Currently, after procmail breaks incoming into lists, I sort
cypherpunks by subject and "pre-delete" all the noise discussions (other
than a few like tcm or gilmore or perry, etc.). I could get nasty with a
more aggresive procmail (mine only splits incoming into separate lists and
wipes out Dr. Fred before it even gets to any list).     Do a few of us wish to hash this problem out in email?  Maybe we could swap the responsibility around when someone is out of town.

I think they have that one covered --not only is it violation of ITAR's intent to send a programmer out of the U.S., but is illegal to hire a foreign national to program for your non-U.S. products.
    the test is going to be with someone like Sun who "bought" a group of Russian crypto programmers and left them in Russia.  Now, the problem with ITAR is that if you import that code, you can not then export the code since it is now covered by ITAR.
    secondly, it appears there is a move afoot to make it an ITAR violation to hire the foreign nationals to circumvent ITAR --basically, the Feds want to stop cryptography _everywhere_, including telling Russians they can not work for U.S. companies!  Just where do they think they are getting off?

@_subject: SUN, UNIX, et al versus MS standards 
my only comment on Sun's non-portable software is that it
**used-to-be** a case of excessive Berzerkely attitude. Solaris is an
effort, and a very credible effort to meet industry and consumer
standards.  The code is compatible to Sys V R4, and on x86 implementations
will execute Sys V R4 binaries, as well as SCO binaries which opens that
whole set of markets (software availability).    at the Solaris 2.1 and 2.2 levels, Sparc Solaris and X86 Solaris were
not even compatible to each other. I just took 200K+ lines of code from a
Sys V package and ported it to both Sparc and X86 Solaris 2.4 --perfect.
The code also had defines for 4.2+ BSD --those also compiled.  Take your
pick.    Sun got the message on standards; their respone was to meet both; and,
they have done a good job of it. Secondly, there is no such thing as
bug-free code --that's like free-lunch and it's all relevant.  Which would
you rather have? patches available on the net, or be forced to upgrade to new bugs with MS plus a few more overkill features.
   Again, my point is: why bad mouth Sun?  This is what has fractured UNIX
in the market place and gives the MS assholes the ability to not only
stomp UNIX with reviews which always ask "...which flavour of UNIX is it
this month?"  but, even worse, it gives Gates an opportunity to set YET
ANOTHER **PROPRIETY** MS STANDARD --that does not run securely with the
mainline.  Do you wish to give Microsoft, whose intentions have never
waivered from getting a piece of every transaction in the world,
**complete** control over everything? on every desktop?  In other words, do you want to see Microsoft, and possibly only
Microsoft/Intel, in the marketplace. Network managers complained about the
Ray Noorda cult, but wait until everybody is forced to join the Bill Gates
cult.    SUN is not the enemy; MS is.  Do you wish to live with MS who,
according to the head cultist, **never** issues a maintenance release
since the software does not have bugs.  Just updates, **expensive**
updates, which fix some bugs, add a few overkill features, and introduce
new bugs.    Is there any really good software for **applications** on UNIX at
even close to windows compatible prices --let alone the wealth of material
available.  Sure WABI gets the main productivity pieces, but PagerMaker
and Corel are frozen at Version 5 for WABI.
   Personally, I use OS/2 as the front end to my Suns;  OS/2 is likewise
frozen at W3.1 level software --but at least WinOS2 does not crash my
entire system or network.  I want some of the features in the W95 versions
of Corel and Pagemaker, such as HTML --they will never be made available

I do not think it is particularly paranoid. the     trend is set. As the UN accumulates power it gains larger support from
    the third world who significantly out-vote, in terms of US standards
    of one man, one vote traditions.     members of the security counsel to justify their singular veto power     (except China, of course). The UN, as it is currently chartered
    effectively leaves the power in the hands of the security counsel; the
    general assembly generally is a forum for anti-American,
    anti-European, etc. rhetoric.     US is boxed into either defying the court with all the intendant
    public relations problems or surrendering its ecomnomic interests.         what it boils down to, a decison must be made between compelling     economic interests and one man, one vote; the latter choking the US     rather quickly.
         got any real samples where forreign courts are     impartial to domestic interest v. US interests?
         I think you're to idealistic as to the results     based on ideology!  or, maybe I am too cynical...  :)
         history is compressing the time frame as     new "history" is made.  As for the nation-state collapsing first, no,     I think it will be a case of the nation-state being helped along by
    the NWO or whatever globalization of power.
        I would certainly rather believe it is a long way off, but the US     is no longer solvent. It has gone from the largest creditor country in
    the world to the largest debtor (v. all the rest of the world
    combined) in a space of less than 50 years.  This is nothing more than
    a self serving bureaucracy promising all things to all people and
    blowing it on basic high school level economics --it is the equivalent
    of kiting checks or credit cards, for which we would go to jail.

I tried to board my 15 year old son on Delta's Sky West in St George UT for SLC last week --they _required_ ID, and it took me almost 5 minutes to back a very polite counter agent down from the requirement.    Now, maybe I am an obstructionist, but I have been foregoing the IRS deductions for my 5 children since I refuse to obtain SSNs for them. Again, that made life interesting at passport time --I entered 000-00-0000 for the kids and passports were issued.     Likewise, I have had more than one hospital _try_ to refuse service for
lack of SSN.    At close to 300 lbs and dressed in black and concave inverter reflector
lenses, it becomes an excellent example of "...intimidation is just
another form of communication...."    Whether we like it or not, "they" intend to tag us --there was a very
informative article on non-intrusive scanning of the iris for
identification within the last month -not sure which rag. from "their" perspective, scanning the iris is far more secure than the imbedded chip.  Maybe we can scuttle it on disrcimination against the visually impaired! :)
   This topic may be relevant since crypto -probably "their" private
crypto after banning ours- will be essential to establish communications
to the central data bank somewhere under the NSA monolith or whereever... On the other, the list topics are too fragmented and I agree with tcm, futplex, etc. that we need more concentration on crypto "methods" -rather than speculation on what method the Feds are going to try to screw us over with next.

"free" access to source code and "free" source code w/ free binaries are too often confused. in and of itself, GNU or Stahlman are not providing free software for whatever use.  GNU allows free distribution, but not free commercialization --a good idea except critical maintenance is at the time-available consideration of the author.
   Sun permits access (well, relatively free) access to their source code for the Java Series and is actively promoting open porting. personally, I like Java/Hot Java.
   as to a GNU-like product, I concur with TCM -it needs to be done before the commerical interests, politicians, NSA, and assorted crooks control the means whereby we communicate, and the browser, IMHO, has improved our communication and access to information by many orders of magnitude. Now, if any of the non-Gates browsers could fully support multi-use/multi-view mail, news, and info browse at the same time....

I personally would be first and foremost concerned with
all the ramifications of destroying evidence; and, testing the rules of
discovery.  In no way am I condoning any action which may be contrary to
the rules of justice in any jurisdiction.
    Keep in mind what "schwarzerPford mit gehornt" said: having asked for help in a public forum, the Co$ attorneys potentially will be going for discovery violations.
    That said..................
    The only way you are going to get automatic disk encryption with OS/2 is to write a driver which would need to distinguish between
drives and/or partitions as you would probably not wish to encrypt the
operating system and routine files.      Secondly, if you have _all_ your files encrypted, you are begging
for a contempt citation if you refuse the keys.  alternatively, you
could reverse engineer one of the disk compress programs (__.sys
drivers) and add a stream function for encryption --again begging
    A better way from my perspective to preserve some of my first amendment rights would be to use an IOMega optical floppy (flopitcal).
    IOmega has a new 100+M byte unit for around $200 which can double as a standard 3.5 floppy and runs on SCSI cards like the Adaptec and
others (they may have an EIDE version).  I believe there is now a
version which is bootable.  The blank disks are under $20/100MB (quite
reasonable).  Unless you are storing an enormouse amount of data, 100MB
is a lot of space (maybe not on my OS/2 system which has 4G!).
    Again, if you wish to run the encryption automatically, then you are   required to write a new driver.     Keep in mind, with a driver, you are immediately faced with the problem of the encrytion keys --particularly if they are embedded in the controller.  You could have one of the keys embedded in each floptical and a utility program to enter the second key, password, etc.  when the
driver started up...  however, from my perspective, you would be better
off to just convert your encrypted files to plain text to work with your
files; then re-encrypting the material when you are done.
    needless to say, the floptical is not very obvious...  and
confiscating your system does not give away the keys, etc.  However, you would be wise _not_ to involve another individual, etc.  Not only is
that a weak point, but it puts them in the loop and provides the government with an opportunity to include conspiracy --which carries the
same penalty as the "crime" and additional charges of obstructing     pgp is available for OS/2, obtainable from Hobbes. BTW, do NOT keep
your key ring, particularly the private key king, on the hard disks;
keep it on a *separate* floppy.  do NOT keep it on the floptical with
the encrypted material.
    we are all concerned with privacy: the first, second, fourth,  fifth,etc. amendment rights --what little there is left of them.  However, regardless of any anarchistic-libertarian viewpoints, the best advice is
not to raise your head --put your helmet on the rifle butt and raise
that if you must --and, if you're riding in a helicopter, sit on your
    revenge may be a dish best served up cold, but anonymous remailers, particularly the encrypting ones, (do not use penet) are wonderful tools for the underground publishing of unpopular political and/or religious beliefs.  There is a long line of court decisions which permit anonymous publishing --despite the fact Bubba certainly intends
to take away our rights, particularly in cyberspace.
    lastly, learn from many who have preceded you: don't stonewall the court --that "fool" in the black robe can ring your bell however he wishes with contempt citations; there is little you can do about it and the local jails are not Club Fed.

Addressed to: Rich Graves               Cypherpunks I'll see your bet...  and raise you five....
 THE MARK OF THE BEAST
        "He causes all, both small and great,         rich and poor, free and slave,         to receive a mark in  their right hand         and in their foreheads, and that no one         may buy of sell except one who has the         mark or the name of the Beast,         or the number of his name"
                Revelation 13:16-17
The following article appeared in Nexus magazine Vol 2, No.20:
        The Microchip and the Mark of the Beast
Dr Carl W. Sanders is an electronics engineer, inventer, author
and consultant to various government organisations as well as
IBM, General Electric, Honeywell and Teledyne.  He is also a
winner of the Presidents and Governors Award for Design
"Thirty two years of my life was spent in design engineering and
electronics designing microchips in the Bio-Med field.
"In 1968 I became involved, almost by accident, in a research and
development project in regard to a spinal bypass for a young lady
who had severed her spine.  They were looking at possibly being
able to connect motor nerves etc.
"It was a project we were all excited about.  There were 100
people involved and I was senior engineer in charge of the
project.  This project culminated in the microchip that we talk
about now a - microchip that I believe is going to be the
positive identification and mark of the beast.
"This microchip is recharged by body temperature changes.
Obviously you can't go in and have your battery changed every so
often, so the microchip has a recharging circuit that charges
based upon the body temperature changes.  Over one and a half
million dollars was spent finding out that the two places in the
body that the temperature changes the most rapidly are in the
forehead (primary position), right below the hairline, and the
back of the hand (alternative position).
"Working on the microchip, we had no idea about it ever being an
identification chip.  We looked at it as beig a very humanitarian
thing to do.  We were all excited about what we were doing.  We
were doing high-level integration for the very first time.  This
team was made up of people out of San Jose, people fron
Motorolla, General Electric, Boston Medical Center - it was quite
a group of people.  My responsibility had to do with the design
of the chip itself, not the medical side of if.
"As the chip came to evolve, there came a time in the project
when they said that the financial return on bypassing severed
spines is not a very lucrative thing for us to be into, so we
really need to look at some other areas.  We noticed that the
frequency of the chip had a great effect upon behaviour and so we
began to branch off and look possibly at behaviour modification.
"The project almost turned into electronic acupuncture because
what they ended up with was embedding the microchip to put out a
signal which effected certain areas.  They were able to determine
that you could cause behavioural change.
"One of the projects was called the Phoenix project which had to
do with Vietnam veterans.  We had a chip that was called the
Rambo chip.  This chip would actually cause extra adrenaline
"I wonder how many of you know that if you can stop the output of
the the pituitary gland (the signal from the pituitary gland that
causes oestrogen flow), you can put a person into instant
menopause and there is no conception.  This was tested in India
and other different parts of the world.  So here you have got a
birth control tool, based on a microchip.  Microchips can also be
used for migraine headaches, behaviour modification,
upper/downer, sexual stimulant and sexual depressant.  This is
nothing more that electronic acupuncture, folks.
"There are 250,000 components in the microchip, including a tiny
lithium battery.  I fought them over using lithium as a battery
source but NASA was doing alot with lithium at that time and it
was the going thing.  I had talked to a doctor at the Boston
Medical Center about what that concentration of lithium in the
body could do if the chip broke down.  He said that you would get
a boil or grievous sore.
"As the development moved along, I left the project and came back
as a consultant several times.  I was used in many meetings as an
expert witness in regard to the uses of the microchip.
"I was in one meeting where it was discussed.  How can you
control a people if you can`t identify them ?"  All of a sudden
the idea came:  "Lets make them aware of lost children, etc."
"This was discussed in meetings almost like people were cattle.
The CIA came up with an idea of putting pictures of lost children
on milk cartons.  Since the chip is now accepted, you don`t see
the pictures anymore, do you.  It's served it's purpose.
"As we developed this microchip, as the identification chip
became the focal point, there were several things that were
wanted.  They wanted a name, an image (picture of your face),
Social security number with the international digits on it,
finger print identification, physical description, family
history, address, occupation, income tax information and criminal
"I've been in 17 "one world" meetings where this has been
discussed, meetings in Brussels, Luxembourg, tying together the
finances of the world.
"Just recently in the newspapers they`ve talked about the Health
Care Program, the "Womb to Tomb" identification!  A positive
identification.  There are bills before congress right now that
will allow them to inject a microchip in your child at the time
of birth for identification purposes.
"The president of the United States of America, under the
"Emigration of Control Act of 1986", Section 100 , has the
authority to deem whatever type of identification is necessary -
whether it be an invisible tattoo or electronic media under the
skin.  So I think you have to look at the facts, folks:  this is
not coming as some big shock.  The paving has been done ahead of
"The road to tyranny, we must never forget, begins with the
destruction of the truth."         -- Bill Clinton, Oct. 15, 1995 at the University of Connecticut.

    under Title 18 861(a), I can vouch for the method...   all
    "they" need is a judge like Peck in El Paso (assassinated on
    the bench) or Foley in Vegas (retired and gone --a hero)
    --both were better known as "Judge Ray Bean, law west of the
    Pecos"  and just about as knowledgeable and reliable....
        First, let me state: this is not a frontal attack on     Zimmermann himself, but a question given some of the     historical precedents and circumstances, and their     implications on the basis of human behavior             --particularly the act of saving one's ass.
        Zimmermann is a political flake, a warmed over 60s
    liberal.         I would find it difficult, despite his apparent altruism
    and left-over 60s need for redress, to believe that
    Zimmermann's coding of PGP was other than a commercial
    stepping stone (judging from both his prior and later     actions); and,
        Zimmermann is nothing but the true liberal he always     was --most of the 60s liberals were against the government
    for one thing only: Vietnam --a morality issue as they saw     it --but they are *still* liberals with liberal morality and     a 'government solves all' outlook on life.
        I won't go into chain of command and discipline, but I     consider my service to have been *wasted* by a government     interested more in a weapons testing playground far more than     any ideology or righteous need of the free world (but we sure     used the ordinance; after all, the difference between men     and boys is the price of their toys!).
        --but the 60s liberal was inflamed by a sense of     (im)morality.
        therefore, we are back to the same old question: does the
    leopard ever really change his spots?  have you ever seen a
    liberal who would not sell his soul to the devil?          I do not wish to blow a conservative horn, but given:
                "the ax and the firing squad are merely stones             on the road to freedom."
                    --attila
    the sacrificial lamb is certainly not your average
    warmed-over 60s liberal who is generally no better than the
    Stalinist "socialist" sympathizers which dominated both the
    State Department and the White House during FDR's reign, as     their cadres gave the Manhattan project and Eastern Europe to
    Old Joe.           FDR's fiasco was also the first perfect example of
    OSI/NSA not willing to prosecute since they were cracking
    Russian crypto.  For instance, I always WANTED to believe     Alger Hiss was innocent in so much as his son, Tony, was a     classmate at Harvard and we were on the editorial board of     the Harvard Crimson at the same time  --but he certainly
    wasn't innocent with the recent release of 50 year old NSA     files.
        therefore, I would not even hesitate to say in relation     to the accusations against Zimmermann: QUITE POSSIBLE; and I     would certainly expect our sleazy government to make the     offer.
        I am not interested in sitting in judgement of Phil     Zimmermann --let his conscience be his judge.         however:
        ***  WE WOULD BE FOOLS NOT TO EXAMINE WITH A FINE ***
        ***  TOOTH COMB PGP's IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RSA   ***
        ***  ALGORITHMS                                   ***
        secondly, there is nothing to prevent us, as a group,     from building a universal RSA application with a portable GUI
    (I think we can all afford Zinc (yuk...  but it covers the
    platforms cheaply --and this is not an exotic interface     requirement), and we can leave open hooks and interfaces for     mail, streaming, and every other purpose with a single     structure call.
            ANYONE WISH TO VOLUNTEER?  --for both problems.
        and, if no-one else has the guts to post the new PGP key     server compliant system software as freeware source code, I
    do!  "Their" only solution for me is murder, which is
    certainly not below their dignity; but I am old enough not to
    care.
        NOW, given that Zimmermann was supposedly insolvent at     the time of the "their" investigation, where did the money
    come for PGP, Inc. and where did the money come for the
    acquisition of ViaCrypt (the commercial licensee)?          Zimmermann was NOT funded prior to the acquisition and     PGP, Inc. was announced virtually the same day the DOJ     dropped the case.          not intending to slander Phil, but these are types of
    prosecution deals our "government of whores" (O'Rourke) is     famous for proposing  --in other words: the premise is
    open for interpretation.
        I've always believed it is not only to be clean, but to     appear clean in that there is no reason for suspicion of     anything but clean...   does Zimmermann make the test?
        HOWEVER, I do think the RSA algorithm (for instance,
    the freebie RSA routines used in mixmaster) and its
    associated code are safe to a given bit level which     theoretically can be incremented indefinitely as hardware
    performance advances accordingly.         --I seriously question "they" can break the algorithm
    itself except by brute force. The question is how far up the
    bitstream are "they?"          and, we should never be so complacent as to presume
    "they" will not land on an algorithmic method to create the
    primes from the bit stream --after all, they have two of the     four numbers and the products...
        just playing a hypothetical game on "their" fears,
    "their" pronoucements, "their" tolerance of low number
    bit encryption, and NSAs use of hardware at least a
    generation ahead, I would gamble NSA's brute force methods
    can probably break 1024 bits currently, and in a "reasonable"
    time.
        NSA is a game --they will grant the public 64 bits based
    on their estimate of the time required with a given level of
    hardware to break EVERY message in a finite number of
    sub-seconds --leaving the heavy hardware for the good
    stuff,
        at this point Thomas Scheling's theories come into play
    --I took Scheling's first course in "Game Theory" at Harvard
    in '60 --he was extremely ignorant on number theory and
    related statistical analysis --we called the course: "War
    Games."
        secondly, NSA, and the rest of "them," will play the game     of appeasement, fighting the good guys with delaying tactics
    as they surrender 64, then 128, then 256, etc. --talk, talk,
    talk...  and Nero is still fiddling...
        meanwhile NSA's capability to crack the good stuff is
    increasing rapidly enough to keep up with the directive that
    they must be able to decode EVERYTHING.          there are routines to eliminate brute force as a means of
    decryption, but they are painful and cumbersome in a public     key system.   plus, publication will bring the morning after
    visit from two or more spooks in raincoats...   who are not
    your friends.
        the game of appeasement depends on enough people WANTING
    (not necessarily willing) to believe that what they hear from
    big brother is the truth, or maybe better expressed as that
    old "Faith in America, land of our fathers" routine.
        anyone around here with insufficient cynicism to buy into
    NWO appeasement?

    I had a roommate at Harvard (late fifties) who had incredibly deep         pockets. his mother died his freshman year, leaving him her estate     on the tip of Fisher's Island, including the costal defense battery     positions and bunkers.
    he had an Apache twin for which I managed to get a license including     instrument very quickly --we then went to FI for weekends and     built and fired everything you can imagine.  only a few curious     paid us any mind as the closest estate to hers was at least 1/2     mile.
    can you imagine that today? --the tip guards the entrance to     the New London pig boat pens and the LI sound!      there were still plenty of professors with both knowledge on the     early rockets, and open enough to "private" teach. My advisor was a     Nobel prize winner, very accessible, and provided both help and     introductions to men most never knew even existed in the vast     science complex north of the yard.  most were in the same old     building (Pierce) with the RF screens on the outside walls to     shield against the primitive radar  --long dark and narrow halls.
    It is a whole different ball game in academia. men whom I have
    recently met are nothing like their predecessors who were open and
    warm --everyone is so "professional" and they are _cold_.
    sad story in general.
    some bright spots though, I guess.  I was rather surprised by
    experiments and their depths in AP Chemistry offered my third son
    by St George's Dixie High School --impressive and not the usual     restrictions on "oh, poor Johnny might hurt himself while clowning
    ...err learning."  a) we have better discipline which works; and
    b) we don't put up with those silly whiners (so far).
    but the future does not speak well with declining tests scores     which, for instance, require the SATs to be watered 20-30% so the
    median would still be 500!  to think that the pair of 800s I
    received in the 50s can be acquired by someone scoring less than
    650s --what value has the US placed on education?  enough so our
    students now rank well down in the second 10 on international     tests!  what makes that worse is the _majority_ of Korean
    students can perform --the lower 1/3 of our students have already
    dropped out of school, and the second third are too uneducated
    to participate.  junior colleges are graduating students who
    would not have passed out of tenth grade 20-30 years ago.
    and, the government wants more mind control --even Bitch's "It
    Takes a Global Village."  at least it's fat chance out here in
    the high desert.

    well, I class out as a Generation 1, born before the war --as a     multi-disciplined generalist.  during the 70s and 80s, we sat     in the king's chair when they need us. by the late 80s and in     the 90s, all they want are narrowly focused specialists, ignoring
    the generalist concept of overview and understanding the "big     picture. we are considered too broad to understand the high tech...      --and obsolete.     I used to call most of my contracts "on the job training"  --but     the point of a generalist is the ability to comprehend the narrow     field and separate the bullshitters and space-shot dreamers from     the doers.  just who on that team can cooperate well enough to
    get it out the door when it is months (or years) behind.  it was
    the last legal stand of the man with a mask and gun.
    My only complaint is that generation 1 generalists were dead about     five years too soon --unless you were Gordon Moore, etc.  those of     us who were cowboys --the last and best gunslingers in the West;     we were passe. I never once in my 35 year career collected a W2     wage, (and sometimes none in any form --feast or famine).
    Tim May probably pulled off the best of all gigs --on the Intel
    wagon as it went down, with stock options which gave Tim full
    independence in his low forties.
    I may not have much of a pot to piss in, but it was one long
    rockin' and rollin' ride  --basket to hell and all. you don't     look back, you just slam the throttle forward --same way I fly     stunt planes or hang from the apes of my hawg.      several of my five children are true generalists. have I (am I)
    advised them to go the route of the cowboy --not on your life!     but I certainly do not recommend engineering in any form --they     would be bored out of their squashs and in-trouble/restless all     their lives.  I encourage academia --the last refuge of the     absent-minded professors and researchers.  I do not like academia
    in general, but at least you can breath.     all the government wants and expects is mindless robots, useless     automans. I have "persuaded" more than one school district and its     teachers to stop playing with my kids' heads, trying to change     them to Hillary's mold for a global village... (so I practiced a     little: "...intimidation is just another form of communication"      --BFD, whatever works...).
    even today's computer kids are poorly focused; they have no concept
    of what's under the hood, or why!  they have no interest in the
    technology, methodology, or the modular concept of solution.
    they in the turn, and sooner than later, will be burned out without

@_subject: Cypherpunks as Philosopher Kings [was permanent invasion of privacy] 
Currently, I am not sure what the charter of cypherpunks     really stands for, if anything.  As it stands, the list has     a far more erudite group than the list it probably should be.     certainly more privacy and social engineering issues resulting     from the deprivation of privacy than code.
        I don't believe Cypherpunks was ever intended to be a technical
    forum; I was not on for the first few months so I missed the     formative discussions of the elitist few, most of whom, other than
    founder tcmay, have left for greener pastures.         In the beginning years, there was a substantial amount of     crypto code, etc. passed around and argued. However, the few of us
    who do code, do not generate enough messages relating to code to     warrant a list; therefore the passionate interests which travel     as coders' baggage seem to explode and others, some technically
    competent and some not, join the list and the circus goes on.
        Frankly, I have hired and "mind-fucked" (pardon my french, for
    lack of a more descriptive expression) scores of hacker grade
    philosophers.  That is exactly where it runs: they are philosophers
    first and creative coders second. As to their knowledge of philo-
    sophy, and the direction of their creative talents to a logical
    and usable conclusion, they score a fat zero as by and large they     are geeks and idealistic social nerds. --hence the need for subtle     background manipulation to make these philosopher-coders think your
    design is actually their great philosophic-coder design.         Yes, and _never_ assign two of them to the same compartment:     the code never works  --absolutely will not share tasks. Common     interface boundaries? No problem for their minds, but too     creatively selfish to code associative modules.  For that reason     alone, I hold C++ in contempt: a black box that is _supposed_to_     to look for 'this' and give you 'that.'  C++ is an ignorant
    managers ultimate wet dream:  "reusable code containers for     disposable programmers."  For some reason, Bjorn elucidated a     strenuous objection to my statement.         For what it's worth, the above is my perception of cypherpunks:     an interesting collection of philosopher kings, some of whom are
    putting their convictions to the means of thwarting the common     enemy.  It is no accident most subscribers, and certainly all the
    doers, are anti-government with a preference for social anarchy,
    the anarchy tempered by some level of realization that the mass
    of humanity can not govern itself in a society which is inherently
    evil. However, if the Libertarian Party can not field a better     candidate than Harry Brown, anarchy, or a premature dictatorship,
    it will be.  The US is in the last laugh of the oligarchy at this
    point in time. In <1.5.4.32.19961218084853.005de95c at popd.ix.netcom.com>, on 12/18/96    at 12:48 AM, stewarts at ix.netcom.com said:

@_subject: some clarification of jurisdiction in Berstein (long) 
the question:
::I've seen two other reports (one from NBC) that say the ruling
::only covers the one federal district.
::Any lawyers want to clarify?
        The caveat: the following is a personal opinion and is not, in     any way, to be considered either legal opinion or legal advice.     Hire an attorney who specializes in these issues before you do     anything rash which might qualify you for three hots and a cot.
        Basically, jurisdiction is all a question of who wants to     honor whose decision until a higher level either affirms or     rejects the lower court ruling (or sends it back w/o a full ruling     but requiring a review of some part of the decision by the lower     court).
        Generally speaking, the decision is valid for the Northern     District of California, but a Federal district judge anywhere in     the U.S. can make a concurring decision based on citing Judge     Patel's decision that source code is protected under Amendment 1.
    In other words, the cite is valid anywhere, and can be used as the     basis of a decision.         Likewise, another district judge somewhere in the U.S. can     issue a contrary ruling, still citing Judge Patel's ruling, but     disagreeing with its tenants; or even ignore the decision and     forge new ground.         The basic rule of thumb is each federal judge is 'Judge Roy     Bean, Law West of the Pecos' in his own courtroom, and able to     virtually ignore even USSC rulings by claiming the action is not     the same for some silly reason.  He may be reversed on appeal...         As for Judge Roy Bean, there have been a number who might     qualify for the type in the Ninth Circuit who come to mind: Manny     Real in LA, Hadder in LA, Foley in Vegas, and one in El Paso     (whose name escapes me --maybe Peck), who was assassinated,     probably by the drug trade, about 20 years ago. These are     mavericks with a high percentage of cases reversed on appeal. Two     of the four are of questionably diminished mental abilities, one     was of questionable ethics, and one is just plain nuts --or at     least off the wall (IMHO).          I have not read the full Bernstein decision as yet, but I     understand there are a fair number of unresolved issues such as     binary objects. This again can spawn additional test cases, either     by someone challenging the issue as Bernstein challenged the     source code, which I consider was the correct decision as anyone     can read source --understanding source code may be more difficult     than reading a bad Russian translation of the nuances in Alice in     Wonderland for some... (your mileage may vary...)
        Leaving government appeals out of the equation, if there are     two or more district courts within an appeals circuit, whose     fundamental opinion: 'source code is protected under Amendment 1     rights' do not agree, the obvious step is for the Ninth Circuit     Court of Appeals, either by a 3 judge panel, or a full court     review, to take jurisdiction and decide which of the two opinions     suits their fancy. If a 3 judge panel does not give the decision     expected, there is also a possible review by a full court on the     motion of either party.
        Now, suppose the Ninth Circuit affirms Judge Patel. At that     point every district court within the jurisdiction of the Ninth     Circuit uses the Bernstein case as a given, an affirmed precedent;     the rulings will reflect that unless some clever clown adds a     twist and the judge falls for it.         Again, setting aside appeals, there are multiple circuit     appeal regions.  None of these are bound by the Ninth Circuit     decision, but it is a citation of importance.  Now, if there are     significantly different opinions in the appeal circuits, then the     Supreme Court will decide whether they will accept the decisions     for review, deciding which decision is valid; or the USSC can     ignore it.
        Personally, I would publish anything regardless. I've had more     than one go around with the simpletons.         The first time the goons in gray trenchcoats shake you out of     the rack in the early morning, there is a real adrenalin rush;     after that it's: "Oh, shit, you guys again, who wants some     coffee?"  Whatever you do: keep your mouth shut; even teh previous     thought is risky the assholes might charge you with attempted     bribary of a Federal official.          I have been quiet for 20 years; as you get older you get a lot     more cranky, and less concerned with your welfare. You know:     "strike another blow for Liberty, FUCK the CDA" and so on.  Be a     martyr; give your all for the cause.  Eventually you end up in     Springfield, Missouri, home for Federal Criminally Insane     political victims.         Larry Flynt (Hustler) managed to get away from the Feds who     can hold an "insane" individual in their custody indefinitely:     certifying him insane with one hand, while the other hand gives     him a chemical lobotomy. Larry Flynt was sent to Springfield by a     Federal Judge in LA for contempt of court --wearing an American     flag as a diaper in his wheelchair (paraplegic).          Unless you're a little crazy, I don't think I would start     publishing source code yet. Oh, I expect it would be difficult     for the Feds to get convictions with a strong precedent decision.
        But, keep in mind, federal judges are appointed on the basis     of an ad in the local bar rag: 'wanted: middle aged person with     failing law practice and good political connections.'  A Federal     judge is appointed for life; after age 65 they are able to choose     cases which interest them; most of them seem to die on the bench     (some would dispute they were ever alive on the bench).         It's been said, "what do you call a lawyer with an IQ of 40?"          "Your, Honour."
        If you wish to lay down the bait trail in the Northern     California district, by all means, go ahead, but you might find     yourself charged in a criminal action, and the government     presenting a case that your charges are 'different' than the     Bernstein case: Bernstein just wanted to publish an academic     paper, you are charged with violation of the munitions act and     maybe treason and espionage.         And, always remember your opponent is a drug-crazed 800 lb
    gorilla with a mission: conviction.          This case is the big one: Bernstein was the plaintiff, in a     civil action. You will be the _defendant_, in a criminal action.         I would not put a scenario like this past the DOJ scum; maybe     multiple times to try and obtain results which match their     corroded mental image of peace, prosperity, and union harmony.
        The DOJ is not interested in either justice or the Bill of     Rights. Federal attorneys are striving for high conviction rates,     like Vietnam body counts --and are enforcing the policies of the     administration, not the courts, the constitution, or the people.         If you managed to get here through the convoluted logic, I     would be careful of how you loosen the floodgates.  At this point     we have made a statement which is a serious breach of their armor.     We obviously need additional test cases to clarify the position,     and the decision must ultimately be decided by the USSC.         I would caution for another reason: if the Feds choose a     preferred defendant who is flagrant, obnoxious, and on flaky     ground; _they_ may have a good precedent, not us. Academic     challenges are certainly among the best --a bit easier to make the     point for education than for pornography.         The next step IMHO, should be a challenge that object code is     just a shipping container for the source code.

        and where does the average hacker find a reliable attorney in     these matters?  more likely you will find the usual charlatan     mouthpiece who will give it a whirl, be body-traded out, and still     take your money.
        and that is just what is so special about pro bono attorneys:     they have their soul on the line; and, even better, when the     horsepower has the folks at Baker & Hostetler behind them (even if     their head office is in Cleveland --my mother remembered Hostetler     when he helped his father deliver milk door to door in East     Cleveland (in the 1910s!))

        Absolutely!         Given the concept I propounded a few days ago that each Federal     District Judge is his own 'Judge Roy Bean, Law West of the Pecos,"     he still has reference to the decision; he can either use it as the
    basis of the decision in his court, or he can ignore. If the case has            been to appeal and affirmed; and, Judge Roy is in the same appeals     circuit, an adverse decision is not likely to stand.
        What's the point?  PRECEDENCE!
        Bernstein (who hung on despite dealing with a mute point in his
    own case), the EFF, and all the  pro bono  attorneys who made
    the case successful are to be congratulated.          We, if we love our freedom, owe all of the players a rather large     debt of gratitude for blowing a hole in Fort Clinton.
        and, I will stand up and say "thank you!" any place I can.

a good review by Greg Broiles of the reasons, expressions of     "faith and doubt," etc. on the part of Judge Patel, and further     confirmation of my statements on the wide open plains of judicial     discretion on the federal bench.  Judge Patel is also to be     commended for her courage of standing up to the pressure from the     DOJ and the White House; I doubt she is high on their popularity     chart...         I think my comment on firing a shot which has breached Fort     Clinton and the thanks we owe Bernstein and all the lawyers is     about the bottom line --we have hit the target, but we have not     killed the beast.  It will take many more decisions, on a case by     case basis, to fight the administration, and a few brave souls     could be looking at three hots and a cot before it is over.
        have no doubt:  Bubba has no intention of backing down. Free     speech, and private communication over open public lines, removes     the power of the government to intimidate the populace; and takes     away the media's slanted exclusivity.      Expect a wave of prosecutions as the DOJ goes for broke.

@_subject: Just another government fuckover: New crypto regulations 
books are and have been protected prior to the US Constitution.     one can presume books with crypto source code would be protected     accordingly; one Federal judge (Patel in SF) has ruled source code     is protected under freedom of speech and therefore can be published;     yet another judge in the Washington area has ruled it is not.  There     is no question the feds will appeal Patel's ruling in the Ninth     Circuit (known to be pro rights in general, but difficult to     predict).  eventually it will go to the US Supreme Court.
        my personal opinion is the Supreme Court will rule against it     using a rationale that the actual source code sections of a book can     be classified as can any other intellectual property under the     National Security Act. Secondly, they will not consider that form of     speech an inalienable right.         I had my rounds with the bastards years ago, no fucking humour     whatsoever, and prone to use the IRS to enforce what the courts     could not afford to enforce due to the requirements of disclosure in     the courtroom at the time (which have since been plugged); and if     that does not work, set you up for financial fraud, fraud by wire,     or dope.  Today dope is the perfect charge; it has been whipped into     a frenzy by the feds and their CIA infiltrated media.  let me assure     any doubters the real extent of terror which the spooks can apply.
        the US Government has not been a legal government for years; it     is a private club which can be bought, and its services sold to the     highest bidder.  It is a collection of whores who are part of a     cabal of the very rich and powerful; it is totally unaccountable     to the public it represents.  Waco, Ruby Ridge, and the bombing of     their own federal building in Oklahoma City in order to scare Joe     Couch Potato into giving up personal freedoms for security are     perfect examples of a government drunk on it owns powers.  Just like     Oswald, they have a perfect patsy with the defendants in OKC.
        P.J. O'Rourke states it correctly:
            "And the Clinton administration launched an attack
                on people in Texas because those people were
                religious nuts with guns.
            Hell, this country was founded by religious nuts with guns."
        O'Rourke also said:
             "Giving money and power to the government is like
                giving whiskey and car keys to teenaged boys"
    and there is no better example than the cocaine stoned, reckless     mentality of Bill Clinton.
        an important fact to keep in mind in US judicial review: few of     the judges can be relied on 1) to resist pressure from the Feds and     2) to take the rights of the people seriously and as 'inalienable     rights.'  this may sound pessimistic and cynical, but the courts     have been sliding, in some cases rather quickly, to a position that     echoes the UN Bill of Rights:
        the UN's "International Covenant on Civil and Political
        Rights" (ICCR): Article 18 states that "everyone shall         have	the right to freedom of thought, conscience and
        religions or beliefs may be subject only to such         limitations as are prescribed by law and necessary..."
        in other words, I do not think we will see the feds permit the     use of books to export cryptography.  this almost becomes irrelevant     outside the academic world in the provisions of the regs which     effectively block hardware or software products and in effect seem     to cut off the loophole of US companies funding overseas operations     and importing the results, etc.  the new regs basically ban it all     ways.  and the new regs are not the supposedly improved and friendly
    versions promised --they are draconian.
        books are an intellectual 'solution' to the problem. the real     problem is the hardware. in order to negate governments and their     virtually stated intentions of blocking our inalienable freedoms,     particularly freedom of speach, we must be able to distribute     universal crypto worldwide, and be able to improve it as the shadow     governments of the various spook shows improve their ability to     break our code.
        this last round on the ITARs blew out distribution.  asking     visitors to your web sites if they are U.S. citizens is not going to     be sufficient for Bubba's goons: Janet Reno and Jamie Gorlich.
        the only real solution is guerilla warfare; anonymous     distribution; overseas' establishment of clearing houses for updates     and source code.         freedom of information is just that simple; there are no     compromises.  Patrick Henry said:         "Give me Liberty or Give me Death."
        publish, publish, and civil disobedience. Patrick Henry used     handbills.         knowledge is knowledge --get it in the public domain, and     in the public's hands even if you must go door to door like a     fuller brush salesman...  but your product is free and it is for     their freedom.
        don't waste your time getting out the vote; get out there and     fight.  contribute.
        if you do not have the balls to do it, you are not for freedom.
        the only natural cure for corrupt government is bright sunshine.
    and a rope.

        free speech, which is what we are talking about. supposedly     absolute freedom of speech in America was in the Articles of     Confederation and was a major point of the Declaration of     Independence.  free speach was an "intention" of the Magna Carta.

        just a little bit too close, is it not?  The Kremlin then, and
    the Kremlin of Yeltsin also suffer the same malady: the personal
    expression of power. Gorbi will be remembered in history as not a
    great statesmen as he was initially hailed in the West, but as the
    'great concessionaire,' giving Russia's "imperial" power away.     Russia never had a communist government, it was a dictatorship
    somewhat tempered by the power of the apparati (which under Stalin
    was a joke); it just so happened they practiced the art of the
    commune in collective farming --except they stole the bulk of the
    communes' production.  Any concept of the commune ownership was
    fantasy.         but the bottom line with Brezhnev was the "drunk with power" of
    each of the petty fiefdoms.  Old Joe and Beria is a perfect example,
    except Joe took care of his problem promptly to prove the rule that
    'thou shall not covet thy boss...'.         compare today in Russia: Lebed is a prime example. Even under
    Brezhnev he would have walked the one way tunnel. Fact is, it
    appears Lebed has been closer to the mark than the rest of the
    pompous fools; but that certainly has not helped if one considers
    Lebed would need to assume absolute power in order to clear the
    errant course of the Russian ship of state --absolute power corrupts
    absolutely.         the US has two or three power factors depending on your point of
    view. The visible US government with a totally corrupt and
    depiscable asshole at the helm --a sublimely and malignantly corrupt
    man installed as a puppet gone drunk on his cocaine power pack;  he
    thinks he has shaken his masters and his battle is to control the
    CIA and the rest of the hidden spook show.  Even his loyal puppy,
    John Deutsch, was unable to control the CIA, let alone the rest of
    the apparati.  The lame duck cabinet is more impotent than the last,
    who almost to a man jumped as rats from a sinking ship.  His thrust
    for power is masked in rhetoric of "for the good of the country" or
    "to protect the country from the evils of private speech which might
    be criminal or subversive" that we may all be free.  Is it
    coincidence free speech is the cornerstone of democracy?         So who does control the real apparati?  check behind the silent
    curtains of the dark drawing rooms; check behind the facade of US
    Department of State postings since WWII, and compare names with
    events and the social register and the rolls of Harvard, Yale, and
    Princeton; check the bunkers at Fort Meade and other places; check
    the shadows and the denials; particularly check the denials.         don't wast your time with the myriad of 'culprits' starting with
    the Bilderbergers, the CFR, the TLA, the Bavarian Illuminati, etc.     they are just drinking clubs of the power hungry united only by a
    common greed.  greed and absolute power as America careens into
    history and disenfranchisement.         is there then still a third force?  speculation?  fact!     avengers?  too little, too late?  hunted to the status of endangered
    species or even to extinction?  sacrificial lambs or goats for the
    alter of the temples of the doomed?  or saviours?

        20 years ago, the Vietnam protests were just dying down. the     movie industry which has been one of the more vocal anti-war     centers (except in making violent war movies which make money) was     still somewhat respectful of the USG.          Other than the liberals who give Bubba a birthday party     --probably more for their own publicity (except Barbra), most     everybody is getting fed up with the government and beginning to     realize the USG not only over governs, but the public is also     beginning to understand the usurpation of power, and the basic     unconstitutionality of the regulatory agencies.          Utah is as good an example as any; they have never been     Fed supportive (even if it was Republican), but the church mandate     is to support the government --however, they are quickly swinging     to a large majority which not only does not like the Federal     government, but who are also actively stating the government is     illegal--  and the church is silent.
        The other Intermountain states have been just plain independent     minded, but tolerated the Feds. Not any more.  Idaho and eastern     Washington are not a safe place for the Feds.  Montana makes no     bones about it; Wyoming, Colorado, and New Mexico are vocal. And AZ     is as pissed as they come over the MJ pronouncement "--what do you     mean the Feds are telling us our vote is worthless and our States'     Rights don't mean pig shit."  Nobody particularly cares about the     MJ, it's the pure and simple emphasis on States' Rights and the     Voters' Rights to self-determination and the 10th Amendment.

@_subject: WSJ: Cable Ruling may Portend Internet Regulation 
WSJ 01 Jul 96
Cable Ruling May Portend Internet Content Restrictions
What looks at first glance like a Supreme Court victory for free
expression in cable television could turn out to be a First Amendment
quagmire encouraging restrictions on the Internet.
That's the view some constitutional experts are taking of a high court
ruling Friday that struck down parts of a 1992 law designed to curb
"indecent" programming on cable channels leased to local groups or set
aside for the public.
"It's a sweeping victory for legitimate First Amendment expression,"
declared Michael Greenberger, one of the attorneys who represented
public-access cable producers who challenged the law. Conservative
advocates on the other side of the case also claimed victory because  part of the law was preserved. "American families fighting to  shelter young children from cable-television pornography won a major  battle today as the Supreme Court upheld the right of private cable  operators to screen pornographic programs," said Cathy Cleaver,  director of legal studies at the Family Research Council.
But some liberals were less sanguine. The ruling "tastes sweet at  first," said Prof. Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School, "but it turns  out to be a sugar-coated poison pill for the First Amendment." He  argued that the reasoning in the court's main opinion, written by  Justice Stephen Breyer, was highly cautious and pragmatic rather than  sweeping. This approach could be used to permit aggressive regulation  of the Internet if the government can show that the global computer  network gives children access to indecent material, meaning material  that depicts sexual activities or organs in a "patently offensive" way.
The Supreme Court produced six opinions but not one that commanded a  majority; the vote counts were 6-3 and 5-4 to strike down two of the  cable restrictions at issue, and 7-2 to uphold a third.
In a separate case last month, a special federal court in Philadelphia  invalidated key parts of a 1996 law aimed at curbing indecent material  on the Internet. The Clinton administration last week said it would  appeal that ruling to the Supreme Court. The Philadelphia court relied  on ringing First Amendment rhetoric to decry government interference  with the Internet.
Justice Breyer's opinion on Friday was strikingly different in tone and  method. He took great pains to underscore the seriousness of the  government's concern about exposing children to adult programming and
explicitly rejected the sort of categorical legal analysis that looks  with great skepticism at any restriction on the content of programming.
The trio of provisions at issue in the case were pushed by Republican  Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina as last-minute amendments to a  broader 1992 cable-regulation bill. They authorized cable-system  operators to prohibit indecent programming on leased channels and  public access stations reserved for educational and governmental use.  If an operator chose to allow indecent programming on leased channels,  the Helms amendments required the operator to "segregate" such  programming from other offerings, block it and provide it only to  customers who requested it in writing.
Supporters of the legislation said they were targeting leased-access  programs in New York and elsewhere that feature hard-core pornography.  The Supreme Court case arose from lawsuits filed by community-access
programmers who argued that the law would ban legitimate shows on sex
education, abortion and other topics that could be defined as indecent.  (In the legal lexicon, indecent material receives some First Amendment
protection, whereas "obscene" material, defined as that which lacks any
social or artistic value, doesn't.)
In Friday's ruling, the high court by a 7-2 vote upheld a provision  that encourages -- but doesn't require -- cable operators to prohibit  indecent programming on leased access channels. There is plenty of  evidence on those channels of pornographic material that lacks social  merit and should be kept away from children, Justice Breyer said. The  provision isn't overly broad, he added. Adults seeking racy shows can  look to the larger commercial cable channels, where they are plentiful.
By a 6-3 vote, however, the court struck down the provision that
requires operators who choose to allow indecent programming to block it  for all but those viewers who request it in writing. Justice Breyer  questioned the need to force customers to disclose their viewing  appetites, and he asserted that other, less intrusive means exist to  tailor dissemination of adult material if it is to be provided. As  examples, he pointed to a recently enacted requirement that commercial  cable operators "scramble" or block stations dedicated to sexual  material and another that obliges television manufacturers to install  "V-chips" in televisions that can automatically identify and block  sexual or violent programming. (The high court didn't rule formally on  the constitutionality of these devices.)
Finally, by a 5-4 margin, the court struck down a measure that  encourages cable operators to ban indecent material on public-access  stations. There isn't much, if any, indecency on these channels, but  the law threatens to cause censorship of controversial shows on health,
politics and art, Justice Breyer said.
Daniel Brenner, a lawyer with the National Cable Television  association, said the group was pleased overall with the ruling because  it left operators "with the ability to protect our customers as to  leased access. We wish it had done the same for public access."
The Federal Communications Commission, which had defended the Helms
amendments, managed to find something to celebrate as well. The   decision "reaffirms that the Supreme Court believes that caring about  what kids see on television is a compelling government interest, and  there are constitutionally permissible ways for government to act to  protect kids," said FCC Chairman Reed Hundt. He added that the ruling  "is also significant because it confirms that the government's  definition of "indecency" is not unconstitutionally vague."
Only Justices John Paul Stevens and David Souter joined the Breyer  opinion in full. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor dissented in part.  Justices Anthony Kennedy and Ruth Bader Ginsburg would have struck down  all of the challenged law. The court's most conservative wing -- Chief  Justice William Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence  Thomas -- would have upheld the entire law.
Contractors' Speech
In a pair of other First Amendment cases, the high court ruled 7-2 that  independent government contractors can't be fired for expressing their  views on public issues or for supporting the wrong candidate. In cases  from Illinois and Kansas, the court said that contractors have roughly  the same free-speech rights as public employees. Justice Scalia, joined  by Justice Thomas, dissented from both decisions. "Favoritism," he  wrote, "happens all the time in political life, and no one has ever  thought that it violated -- of all things -- the First Amendment to the  Constitution of the United States."  (Wabaunsee County, Kansas vs.  Umbehr, O'Hare Truck Service Inc. vs. City of Northlake, Ill.)

The official name     of the church since 1838 (eight years after founding) is "The
    Church of Christ and the Latter Day Saints" --therefore preference
    for 'LDS' or 'Saints.'         the use of "Mormon" to describe our members is obvious from the
    "Book of Mormon,"  so named by the fact the prophet Mormon compiled
    and/or authored much of the book, although the last prophet and
    custodian was Moroni (the gold statue on top of LDS Temples is of
    Moroni). = Anyway, I should point out that Mormons (or Latter Day Saints, I = guess) are spreading quickly around the world...all WITHOUT using = "conversion by the  sword," as some other well-known religions are = wont to do. =          our mission is simple: we only ask that you read the material     (preferably including the Book of Mormon) and privately (possibly
    including your family) to get on your knees and humbly and openly

    and more than one U.S. Army was sent by Washington to subjugate
    and/or exterminate us.

        The LDS position of war and conscientious objects is dual: if
    you profess to your Bishop you wish to be a conscientious objector
    (following the example in Alma), you will be supported; or, if you     wish to be called to duty (as the striplings of Helaman who had
    not covenented to not raise arms). you will be supported,         as this example from the Discourses of Brigham Young:
        them we will cover you up, and there will be no more of you.'         I never think of that little company of men without the
        next thoughts being, "God bless them for ever and for ever."         All this we did to prove to the Government that we were         loyal.

        I think most of the basics were covered in the list response,     except each had a piece or two to say, part of which was usually
    incorrect, and none caught the scope of the issue in its fullness.
        Until a patent is sucessfully challenged _and_ "destroyed," it     is resumed valid in the country of issue, regardless of the
    source of a competing product which may have been manufactured in a
    country where patents mean little, if anything.  --e.g.  any
    country other than the U.S., Canada, and Western Europe.
        GOOD patents, with claims which are both narrow enough to     define what is patentable and broad enough to cover "work-arounds,"
    are expensive to obtain:  >$10,000 domestic plus foreign costs.     there are arcane rules as to the time of filing for foreign patents
    if they are to be valid, often requiring separate efforts, and
    different claims, in each jurisdiction.
        smaller companies are obviously at a disadvantage since     resources, particularly in development houses, are small.     development companies tend to recover their expenses with immediate
    product (much smarter than waiting for the patent office to declare
    you King Kong) thereby also avoiding being beaten in the market
    window by an also-ran product.
        An alternative theory is to pray that a Fortune 100 releases     product which violates your patents.  Caveat:  it is still your
    responsibility to "protect" your product and not lose your rights
    by default. This is expensive and further requires that you reduce
    your theory to practice -- you do reduce the theory to practice,
    you are in a very weak position --again, unless you are IBM, AT&T,
    etc.  who practice law by intimidation and burying the opposition
    in excessive and frivolous paperwork.
        Then there is the problem of the capital required to litigate     an interloper.  When I attempted to litigate the Fortune  company
    10 years ago --the MINIMUM advance fee requested by every lawyer
    (even ones I have previously consider fiends) was $2 MILLION;     which, although still less than the contractual royalty claim, was
    not exactly in my bank account!  --and, the greedy bastards also
    wanted 10-15 years to collect and 33-50% of the recovery plus     expenses.
        So, I litigated the claim myself (9 months), and won in Federal     District Court. I was lucky, with a never-used-in-the-US law
    degree; the five other companies in the same bag received nothing
    on their claims:  they could not afford the legal expenses.  I did
    not like lawyers as a breed prior to this incident, and I like them
    significantly less now. we will not discuss the issue of respect or
    their value as a food substitute (really.., they taste just like
    chicken).
        patents are further cluttered by the fact it averages 3 years     to obtain a patent, and technology moves far too fast.  then, even     with fundamental patents such as RSA is holding one of, there are
    the legal challenges as to both the validity and whether or not it
    expresses claims which are both original and non-obvious.
        non-obvious is a key factor --you can not patent the "fact:"     "a chunk of sodium tossed into a toilet ball often destroys the
    toilet...."
        lastly, particulary in software, there is the challenge:     "...all knowledge should be _free_!"  Well, that is fine and good,
    but how do you pay researchers?  have them pump gas all week and     donate research time on the weekends?  very few researchers have
    the piece of mind to be creative when their children are starving.     --oh, well, we still have the unmarried nerds who require only     space to sleep (standing up), BigMacs and chips....
        from my perspective, the patent system is absurd --not because     of the protection it purports to provide, but that it is         a)  ridiculously slow and arcane, dominated by how a lawyer             who has no clue, writes _claims_, in words, defining what             is unique; and         b)  it is insufficient to deal with _intellectual_ property
            rights which can not always be reduced to a simple
            mechanical/hydraulic drawing and some words _claiming_ its
            uniqueness.          The real rub in patents is that _words_, not the technical
    definitions and diagrams, or even the "experts" in trial, that wins     patent litigation.  The circuit diagram or the mathematical     equation is noting more than a sidebar note. Therefore, patents     have become a weapon, a weapon of the established to intimidate the
    new kid on the block.
        what are the chances for meaningful patent reform?  slim to     none. why?  it will offend the lawyers, and their $10,000 words!
        any of you have been involved in patent litigation must realize
    the absurdity of a Federal jury deciding the validity of high-tech     patents.
        and, if you, the developer, take the product to market, you run
    the risk of a major company patenting _your_ idea and litigating     you!  but "I have prior art you scream!" --yes, and they will have     notebooks with a paper trail and you will have none. what does the     legal system require? paper trail.
        personally, I think RSA has been most generous in their     licensing: a personal use license of the basic algorithm is free.     How do you suppose PGP really exists?  it's free!  RSA has done     more to advance cryptography with this policy than any other in many
    years.  the political and public relations benefits to our rights     to cryptography and the public relations bonanza for public     awareness is not even estimable, let alone measurable.  The Federal
    persecution of Phil Zimmerman was a PR bonanza and a rallying cry.
        on the other hand, the Free Software group, despite the     tremendous value to those of us who develop, does nothing to
    protect our basic freedoms, and place the issue before the U.S.     (and world) forum.                                                           whether or not we like like RSA's "charismatic" leader,     give credit where credit is due.  if you are creating a commercial     product, you pay royalties.         remember, patents and patent royalties are a trade-off in the     system.  would you not expect royalties for your patent? I know I     do; have collected many; and, hope to be able to continue to     collect same, despite by dislike of the current U.S. Patent Office.
        that's all, folks!
Fuck off, Uncle Sam. Cyberspace is where democracy lives!

We don't have to like him, just get him to open the gate for us, = and close it for our opponents. =          _all_ politicians face reelection, all politicians must raise     money --special interest groups control large blocks of money, or as
    Mark Twain put it:
        "Congress is the only natural criminal class in America."
    or Will Rogers:
        "Circus?  Why would I want to go to the circus when Congress is         in session?"
        the Federal government as a whole certainly is not the friend of
    the people --we have not had a free election since Lincoln in 1860,     with the possible exception of JFK, whose only true claim to
    greatness was issuing Treasury notes in May '63 --which circulated
    only until he was assassinated.
        how many _truly_ "populist" presidents have we elected?     Jackson, Lincoln, JFK?  Despite the immense fortune (from Joe's
    questionable endeavors); the social connections, even if he was
    Irish-Catholic; and some "ideals" (not necessarily mutually mine),
    JFK was _not_ a product of the establishment, nor the "real"     political machine until he "captured" it.  I was a _paid_
    "consultant" in the JFK '60 campaign, and again for Teddy in '62
    --no amount of pain will acquire further discussion of political
    campaign ethics....
        "mech" is correct, IMHO, in the gatekeeper analogy. Therefore,     *personal* villification of our "enemies" is counterproductive to     our efforts.  unicorn stated:
                "Mind you, I never said Leahy was a giant in the             movement for crypto and privacy interests, just that I             was glad someone had a clue."
    is not our task to educate the Congress critter?  Is it not better     to deal with the critter if he, or his staff, is at least aware of     the issues?  again, unicorn further stated v/v Leahy:
                "His staff are some of the most astute people on the
            hill technologically.  That their view might tend to the
            statist side disturbs me, but I wasn't talking about their             politics. On the hill a competent and fairly reasonable             enemy is much less a problem than an incompetent publicity             seeker."
        generally speaking, communication is _not_ facilitated by     punching your intended correspondent in the nose. extremist demands     are dismissed as such.  maybe I might prefer to clean the house that     greed and control built; but, practically, we either work within the
    system as erudite and rational "educators," or the class is ignored,     if not labelled "dangerously subversive" --which means we will be     first on the roundup....
        however, all of the above ignores reality:  the Federal Reserve     Bank, a quasi-government agency with private owners, represents the     power. JFK recognized the inherent impossibility of debt reduction     when even your interest is borrowed.  The Fed also represents the     international big money pool, and the means of historical     revisionism and the consolidation of power.
        the "ruling class" underestimated the explosion of the Net, just
    like China underestimated the fax. Now the ruling class is playing     catch up, and attempting to sandbag the Net --they probably will not     succeed as the Net will go underground around the world --technology
    is moving faster than regulations.  they may kill mainstream     information privacy, but the innovation of the underground will     outpace their regulations.  Secondly, regulations which are despised
    are ignored and confronted --sure, a few high profile cases will go     forward for intimidation --was PKZ granted "Constitutional due     process?" --or should I phrase that: "...any due process?"
        unless we are willing to patiently and persistently educate the     governing class, no matter how "ignorant" they may appear from our     perspective of inalienable rights, the "enlightened" position is     dismissed as revolutionary excess, and labelled subversive to the     US government.  --and, not only must we educate the governing class,
    but we must educate the people, and the people's media to prevent     the governed from surrendering their inalienable rights for a little
    security.
            "They that give up essential liberty to obtain a little                temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety."
                        --Ben Franklin (Historical Review of PA -1759)
    and, the bottom line is:
              "It is not the function of our Government to keep the citizen
                  from falling into error;                it is the function of the citizen to keep the Government                   from falling into error."

.Just wondering...doesn't such a call for a group purchase of such a
.dangerous book constitute a RICO (Racketeer-Influenced and Crypto
.Organizations Act) violation?
.--Tim May
        I trust your RICO (Racketeer-Influenced and "Crypto"     Organizations Act) is tongue in cheek?   The original title was
    "Corrupt" not "Crypto," though I am sure our friendly 'rules for
    them and rules for us' racketeering influenced corrupt organization
    for a government could define it whatever it to suit their
    purpose....
        as to the suggestion/question --how would you contstruct the
    group purchase of a book to involve RICO?   "racketeering" is     defined as a criminal association whose purpose is to intimidate     others and to deny them theor pursuit of the American dream...     (over-simplified).
        maybe they could try "conspiracy" under Title 18 in general,
    maybe attached to "treason?"  -the ACLU would have a field day; and,
    I, for one, would sign up just to get charged with that in mind     --even fully understanding that only in the US can you be convicted     of the thought of "comspiring" to perform a criminal action.
        surprised I am not sent to jail every time I pass a luscious
    expression of feminity or 'hot potato.'          although the book is not published here (probably from pressure
    applied by the spooks), the book is not _banned_ here which would be     rather difficult to get past the first federal judge, regardless of
    any Jamie Gorelock sniveling claims to national security needs and
    requirements or any of the usual drivel,
        I've seen and been there on stretching the meaning of the     charge, both more than one; I've seen feds lie on the stand     regarding Miranda and the fifth --and get away with it because their
    credibility is still supreme in the courts         the feds still to need some form of charge that is
    "understandable;" and, some compliance with a tame charge --even if
    false, or they expose themselves to the revelation of even more
    information, none of which they want on the table.  trying _us_ on     the allegations contained in the book would be a bonanza for us with
    the first evidentiary round!  what a feast!   --no way will the     funny farm open up on that one.
        Secondly, even if they charged us, they would be on the defense     to try and prove we were "treasonous"  --and they would be trotting     out lots of dirty laundrey for the judge, jury, and press (who     probably could not give a shit).

WIPO Treaty:  Worse than CDA
                Deadline 22 Nov 96 for comment to Congress
        WIPO was introduced this spring to Congress.  It is not     understood by either the Clinton administration or the Congress and
    few of the public are aware of the problem!
        CP internal bad mouthing and intellectual assignations need to
    to come to a dead halt --if we want the net at all, or for the net
    to be an information provider, the impact of the CDA would be     chump change for peanuts in comparison.
        The WIPO clauses involving rights to collections of what are     commonly public domain "fact" will become private property     --literally; even more so than the restrictions of the 'fair use'     conventions. The availability of knowledge emasculated; the impact     on web is catastrophic;  web information and fair use policies     are gutted.

            The following message is an excerpt of a message from James         Love  forwarded by attila         see  Consumer Project on Technology:                     -------------------------------------------------------------------------
.	Sports fans in the United States will be surprised to learn .that U.S. Government officials are pressing for the adoption of .an International treaty that will (if enacted) significantly .change the ways sports statistics are controlled and .disseminated.  The treaty isn't specifically directed at sports .statistics --         it is a much broader attempt to create a new     property right in facts and other data now in the public     domain -- but it will have an enormous impact on the legal     rights  [...] on sports, stock prices, weather data, train     schedules, data from AIDS research and other facts are
    controlled....  See, for example:
                        The treaty addresses much more fundamental issues regarding     ownership of information currently in the public domain...         I am deleting the bulk of the report for brevity, including only
    the definition of the "database" as it applies to WIPO.
.WHAT IS A DATABASE? WHAT ISN'T A DATABASE?
.
.The treaty would protect "any database that represents a .substantial investment in the collection, assembly, verification, .organization or presentation of the contents of the database." .
.This term should be understood "to include collections of .literary, musical or audiovisual works or any other kind of .works, or collections of other materials such as texts, sounds, .images, numbers, facts, or data representing any other matter or .substance" and "may contain collections of expressions of .folklore." The "protection shall be granted to databases .irrespective of the form or medium in which they are embodied. .
.Protection extends to databases in both electronic and non-
.electronic form" and "embraces all forms or media now known or .later developed. . . Protection shall be granted to databases .regardless of whether they are made available to the public. This .means that databases that are made generally available to the
.public, commercially or otherwise, as well as databases that .remain within the exclusive possession and control of their .developers enjoy protection on the same footing."
.
.WHAT ARE EXTRACTION AND UTILIZATION RIGHTS?
.
."The maker of a database eligible for protection under this .Treaty shall have the right to authorize or prohibit the .extraction or utilization of its contents." What is "extraction"? .Extraction is defined as, "the permanent or temporary transfer of .all or a substantial part of the contents of a database to .another medium by any means or in any form." "Extraction . . . is .a synonym for `copying' or `reproduction' . . . by `any means' or .`any form' that is now known or later developed."
.
."Utilization" is defined as "making available to the public all .or a substantial part of the contents of a database by any means, .including by the distribution of copies, by renting, or by on-
.line or other forms of transmission," including the right to .control the use of the data "at a time individually chosen by .each member of the public."
.
.WHAT IS A "SUBSTANTIAL PART" OF THE DATABASE?
.
.The treaty sets out tests for determining if an extraction is ."substantial," and these tests are both highly anticompetitive, .and extremely broad in scope.
.
.The "substantiality" of a portion of the database is assessed .against the "value of the database," and considers "qualitative .and quantitative aspects," noting that "neither aspect is more .important than the other . . . This assessment may also take into .account the diminution in market value that may result from the .use of the portion, including the added risk that the investment .in the database will not be recoverable. It may even include an .assessment of whether a new product using the portion could serve .as a commercial substitute for the original, diminishing the .market for the original."
.
.Then the treaty adds that a "substantial part" means any portion .of the database, "including an accumulation of small portions . . .. In practice, repeated or systematic use of small portions of .the contents of a database may have the same effect as extraction .or utilization of a large, or substantial, part of the contents .of the database."
.In the US implementing legislation, the only types of data use .that would not be regulated would be "insubstantial" parts, ."whose extraction, use or reuse does not diminish the value of .the database, conflict with a normal exploitation of the database .or adversely affect the actual or potential market for the .database." Under this language, a database owner could say that .it might in the future want to charge for each transmission of a .fact or an element of a database as part of its "normal .exploitation" of the database. With the Internet and digital cash .this claim is likely to be made. The public would not have "fair .use" rights, since fair use is only defined in matters involving .copyright.
.
.FOR HOW LONG? 15 YEARS, 25 YEARS, OR FOREVER?
.
.The Treaty would require a minimum term of protection (15 years .in the EU proposal, and 25 in the United States proposal) for the .database. But this is extended each time the database is revised .or enhanced. According to the draft treaty, "any substantial .change to the database, evaluated qualitatively or .quantitatively, including any substantial change resulting from .the accumulation of successive additions, deletions, .verifications, modifications in organization or presentation, or .other alterations, which constitute a new substantial investment, .shall qualify the database resulting from such investment for its .own term of protection."
.
.The provision on revisions raises the specter that protection for .many databases will be perpetual. This could indeed be the case .if the original versions of the database  are only "licensed" by .the vendor for a limited period of time, so that the only .available versions would be the new ones, which would have a new .term of protection. [Database vendors write these restricted use .licenses now].
.
.    The proposals for a new legal environment for publishing .facts are outlined in a draft treaty on "databases" that will be .considered at a December 1996 meeting of the World Intellectual .Property Organization (WIPO), in Geneva, Switzerland.  See:
.
.    .  .    The proposal would require the United States and other countries to
.create a new property right for public domain materials. "Texts, sounds, .images, numbers, facts, or data representing any other matter or .substance," will be protected. . .    The treaty seeks, for the first time, to permit firms to ."own" facts they gather, and to restrict and control the .redissemination of those facts.  The new property right would lie .outside (and on top) of the copyright laws, and create an .entirely new and untested form of regulation that would radically .change the public's current rights to use and disseminate facts .and statistics.  American University Law Professor Peter Jaszi .recently said the treaty represents "the end of the public .domain." . .Copies of the proposed treaty, a federal register notice .asking for public comment, and independent commentary can be .found at:

.          .
.WHO IS PUSHING FOR THE DATABASE TREATY?
.
.	In 1991, the US Supreme Court ruled (in the Feist decision) .that the facts from a telephone "White Pages" directory of names, .addresses and phone numbers were not protected under the .copyright laws, and that in general, "facts" could not be .copyrighted by anyone.  The Feist decision alarmed several large .database vendors, who crafted this new "sui generis" property .right that would protect facts, and just about everything else.
.[The vendors have already succeeded in obtaining a directive on .the database proposal from the European Union, although no European .country has yet passed legislation to implement the treaty]. The .most active supporter of this new property right is West .Publishing, the Canadian legal publisher. A West Publishing .employee chairs a key ABA subcommittee which wrote a favorable .report on the treaty.  A number of very large British and Dutch .database vendors are also lobbying hard for the treaty.
.West wants the new property right to protect the "page .numbers" and "corrections" it adds to the judicial opinions it .publishes in paper bound books.  Telephone companies want to .protect the names, addresses and telephone numbers they publish, .and other database vendors what to protect scientific data or .other non-copyrighted government information they publish.  In .seeking to protect these items, the treaty was written to stamp ."owned by" labels on a vast sea of information now in the public .domain.  Copyright experts J.H. Reichman and Pamela Samuelson  .say  it is the "least balanced and most potentially anti-
.competitive intellectual property rights ever created."   see:
.
.            .
.	In Feist, the Supreme Court noted:
.     (a) Article I, Sec. 8, cl. 8, of the Constitution mandates .     originality as a prerequisite or copyright protection. The .     constitutional requirement necessitates independent creation .     plus a modicum of creativity. Since facts do not owe their .     origin to an act of authorship, they are not original and, .     thus, are not copyrightable.  .     [From the Syllabus of the opinion, at:
. .            .
.Since facts cannot be copyrighted, the supporters of the .treaty have framed this as a new "sui generis" property right, .which will have a separate statutory framework.  "Originality" or ."authorship" will not be required.
. .As a "sui generis" property right, the database proposal .does not incorporate the fair use principles from copyright that .reporters and value added publishers often take for granted.  The .leagues would be able to require license to publish box scores or .other statistics in any media.  One can imagine a world where the .leagues wouldn't require licensing of box scores to print based .periodicals like daily newspapers, but that a much more .controlled regimen would evolve on the Internet.  The leagues .could require licensing of box scores and other statistics for .Internet publications, or linking to the leagues own web sites, .such as:

Enigma Welcome Page
Welcome to Enigma & Co.!
The following text contains various terms that you may not be familiar with.
Please refer to the Glossary section for a description of those terms, or
feel free to call us for more detailed information on how we can help you with
your data security needs.
A data protection system for businesses and individuals, the Enigma & Co.
related products offers security with the means to create personalized encryption schemes in an infinite variety.  In addition, the versions include a complete package of security management tools to enable it to be used in a business or office environment under the oversight of authorized administrators. It also provides routines to handle binary encryption and decryption of both text and non text files as well as all the capabilities needed to accommodate BBS, E-Mail and Internet It is for these reasons plus many more which you will discover in using the
software why our users think it is the finest cryptographic software ever
In addition, unlike public key and other mathmatical cryptographic programs, there
is nothing in the messages and files you encrypt that aids in the deciphering of
your data.  If you encrypt twenty bytes, then the encrypted file is twenty bytes,
containing no clue on how to decipher it.
 About Enigma & Co.'s Cryptography Products
Here's some insight into the enormous power and security offered by Enigma &
Company's products.  You do not need to know all the in's and out's of these
features to use it effectively.  We've designed our systems to be extremely
easy to use.  Some of the main features are:
Wheels: Our Enigma's can use from three up to eight wheels at a time.  A Wheel is a scrambled dataset of characters that is used by the Enigma
systems that your computer randomly creates.  There are
no limit to the number of WheelSets (datasets of wheels) that you can create.
Usable Characters: Our Enigma uses 83 characters on its text wheels and 256 on
its binary wheels. This gives the Enigma user more than six billion more text wheel configurations ("shifts") to choose from, each one of which
will produce an entirely different encryption.  The use of all eight
binary wheels, of course, exceeds this number tremendously. Indicator Word: To make the enciphered message even more difficult
to break, our software provides another feature which allows the sender
to enter a word or a simple phrase that has the effect of adding a
virtual ninth wheel to the text enciphering combination.
Multiple Cryptions: Probably one of the best features of the Enigma
products, you have the means of storing your personalized WheelSets and your Schemes
and then do cryptions in a multiple fashion, using different
WheelSets, different Schemes, and if in text mode, different Indicator
words.  You can also Cross Crypt, that is encrypting in text (83
character) and then in binary (256 characters). Parameters:We created even more power over the cryptive process by adding parameters for both Text and Binary which allow the user to define the direction the wheel in each slot will rotate, and the number of turns before it triggers the next wheel to rotate in its predetermined direction.  Predefined WheelSets and Schemes are also included as well as data files to save and restore parameter settings.
Passes: The Enigma systems allow
the passing each character back and forth as many as 99 times, a device which effectively turns an eight wheel encryption to a 792 wheel encryption or
a 891 wheel encryption with an Indicator Word.
Personal Schemes: Added to the above, the Enigma user is not confined
to the wheel "wirings" that come with this software. He or she is
encouraged to create personalized wheels and schemes, setups that can
be tailored for groups of correspondents or individuals. And to avoid
the possibility of using the wrong scheme with the wrong person, Enigma
allows each special setup to be given a separate file name for later
Slots and Shifts: Each user has the ability of placing different
wheels into the slots in whatever order they prefer and then shifting
them prior to the cryption process.  The act of shifting can in effect
create a totally different wheel from the original positions of that
Shift Ratios: To further complicate the encryption process you can
specify the number of shifts the wheels will rotate when it is triggered instead
of only one rotation.
System Files:All your system files can be removed (cannot be recovered),
transferred and restored either all at once or individually.  The system files
consist of WheelSets, Schemes, Parameters and Code Book data.  About Enigma & Company's Ultra Enigma
The Ultra Enigma system evolved by the addition of a ten numeric input 'key' in the parameter screen.  These ten sets of numbers are used to 'shotgun' the original
message anywhere between eight and five hundred plus times its size, depending
on the values in those ten 'key' inputs.  Ultra hides your data in a sea of
data, thus making decoding by brute force an absolute nightmare.
As our system evolved, three modes of cryption were developed and all three
are present in Ultra Enigma and can be utilized as part of the operating system. Styles 1 and 2 are one-to-one processing (files are not expanded).
In addition, all sensitive data files used by Ultra Enigma can be Transferred,
Restored and Killed (unrecovering them are impossible) leaving your computer
useless to theft and misuse.

.I've often wondered how effective disk encryption programs, like DiskCrypt,

        I don't have any direct experience with 'serious' error     recovery either; however, over a few years span listening to some
    my friends who have not come in from the cold,  I received the
    very definite reading the key is a differential measurement on flux
    and organization which expands the 'hearing' range exponentially
    -even if it is multiple destructive formatting.
        I written software programs for C2 and B1 clearance, including
    primitives which wiped as they went.  I used a pattern which     shifted and repeated itself --not too ridiculous on unix if you are
    using type 2 read/write primitives.  messy? yes, in its own simple
    way.
        The software was certified by multiple fairly sensitive regula-     tory agencies, plus the usual few for whom there is no name. you
    don't expect, and you do not receive, anything more than a yes/no.
    but it was in these circumstances I 'heard' the comments on recovery.
        and their ability to measure that differential gets better     every year!   No, I do not consider 'erased' disks safe from a
    determined federal agency.  I keep sensitive stuff on zip drives
    which are removable, and easily crippled forever.  that and our
    principal [a]vocation: stronger cryptography than the hardware can
    bruteforce or trick.

        well, Jim, at least you are consistent...
        I will not fault your logic in terms of the mental gymnastics
    below, but it is 'method.'   it's like anarchy is the perfect non-
    government in a perfect world.  well...  the problem is the
    perfect world is it not?  then we look at the libertarian view-
    point which starts on the premise of "benevolent" anarchy --but it
    might be a "benevolent" republic or despot to reign in the non-
    reformable greedy, violent, and generally all around "offensives."
        before you get through with just what type of government can
    support the perfect anarchy, your back in the loop trying to find
    the perfect anarchists...   next, who has the power?  --power     corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely.
        could a rule of civil, not common, law which operated under
    fundamentalist islamic rules --except a little more humane in the
    physical application of the punishment work?  would we go so far
    as to suggest a set of "requirements" for any public servant in     office where failure leads to beheading, no appeal.  public     beheading like the Islamic, following afternoon prayer services?
    why not?  it does not seem to be a pleasant way to die.          if I were to face the ultimate sanction, I would take the     firing squad --but not tied to a chair with a bag over my head
    being targeted by seven slobbering men, 3 of which have blanks so
    noone knows who really did shoot the lump of coal tied to the     chair  --they will not shoot you like a man because the state is a     coward, not the man about to die.  the fact you might see your
    executions frightens them --in Utah, which used the firing squad
    a month ago, the condemned _never_ sees his executioners.
        crap!  what's wrong with standing against the wall or a pole?
    can not a man die with a little dignity?  are the 4 out of 7     executions who fire a fatal shot to heart *painted* on the coal
    bag going to be cursed by the condemned?  crap!
        regardless of logic, and temptation to clean up the environ-
    ment, the population is not capable of altruism and will immedi-
    ately slide into a continuous round of retaliatory executions as
    the usual pharisees change your money at the tables set up at
    the temple gates.
        if we had the perfect population base, and no bad apples, we
    would not be in the position of being subject to the Gadianton
    Robbers in the first place.  the problem degenerates to the fact
    the AP scheme will degenerate in a population where everyone is
    just another Gadianton Robber practicing rape, pillage, and burn
    on the countryside.
        the original objective, I presume, was to create the perfect     pseudo-anarchy, and the perfect, innocent as the day they were

    many really good people do you see?          I always say:              "people are generally good people

        we might even be perceived as a good, not evil force...  but
    I doubt it; the press mentality is too low.
        no, I certainly do not think hardware in particular is a bad     idea.  .I assume .that it would be generally straighforward to build a cracking chip that .tries 10 million keys per second, with a great deal of internal parallelism .and pipelining.  .
.Now, THAT sounds like a real threat!
        particulary if the design emphasizes unlimited linear extension!  .An even more ominous configuration would involve perhaps 50 .chips per full-length board, seven boards installed in a stripped-down  PC, .which would produce a crack in 4 months average with one system alone.
.
        without a doubt, this is the best approach, but you will find
    the chassis have a mix of ISA and PCI, or in some cases like I
    specify, they will be EISA and PCI .           I know where there is a 20 slot PCI passive backplane in a     rack mount for $350 and I think the vendor has P133 cards with     either 128 or 512 M 72 pin slots.  512M is about 4,000 smackaroos
    at this point.
        PCI is much easier to interface than ISA and you have the bus
    bandwidth to support the processor to co-processor transfer rates.
        I'm not going to go through the mental masturbation of what DSPs
    and FNGAs could manage in iterations/second until there is a firmer
    design, but 350 chain/parallel or tiered chips sounds like it might
    be more than 10% of the way to a terawhatever.
.So how would all this be done?  First, write a serious proposal for the .project and circulate it among companies with fab capacity.
        disagree, I would not even consider begging at the door of any
    charitable fab until the design, and probably the layout, is in     the can.  we might find it necessary to expand the trace depending
    on the capabilities of the offered facilty, thereby by burning     both more power, and reducing our yield per wafer.          secondly, circulating a proposal among the hungry pack is
    shopping around, which is almost always suicidal in raising money
    and finding manufacturing partners.  they all know each other, and
    you will end up with a "decision by commitee" and we know
    committees are always formed to absolve the participants of blame
    for failing to act, or whatever.
        on the other hand, I may personally have a rather strong     distaste for selected reviewing, but it does give a taker some-
    thing to crow about, that he was honoured to float this little     package....  part of this is getting to the 'good-feeling' state
    where the CEO thinks he will be a hero.
.Likewise, find a politically-sympathetic designer with access to IC .layout software, etc.
        that, and determining what form or methodology will optimize
    the design itself, are the two criticial first steps.  until that is     resolved,  nothing should be done; and get a provisional layout
    before finding the big sponser.  .The way I see it, there has to be a huge amount of .unused 0.5-0.7 micron IC capacity around the world.
.
        yes, in older fabs. but the < 1u lines are loaded as of the
    August summary.
.Remember, we're only .talking about a few hundred wafers.
.
        the real issue is a working prototype --if it's ready to go,
    there should be no trouble persuading a fab to run a batch.
    I think the Tylan and Therm etchers are loading about 100
    six inch wafers and eight inch may be on line.  a six inch
    wafer has 27 sqin total and depending on the size of the     individual .Anyway, the way I see it, you're probably going to burn up over a million .dollars worth of ELECTRICITY alone on a single crack with Pentiums. .
        4500 machines for $1M per year power?

        you wish to hand over the project to Billy?  so all our good     designers are shunted off into never-never land as Billy stands     up in the spotlight and claims it was his brain, and the muscle he

    type design, or a digital filtering processor architecture     --easier to correct small mistakes, too.  If the KISS principle is     used exclusively,  and mutiple step-and-repeats for the layouts,
    a large house like Intel could make real short work of it.

AFTER THIS POST, ALL RELIGION MUST GO OFF THE LIST! see banner below
First, in re: Dimitri's scurrilous attack:
    to paraphrase Winston Churchill...
        Dimitri: "attila, you are drunk!"
        Attila: "ah, Dimitri, you are ignorant,                     but I shall be sober in the morning!"
        I have met some pretty ignorant and some pretty violent men in
my life; despite your alledged education, you are a social abomination, an uncivilized boar, rooting in the gardens of
civilization, snorting your pleasure while distorting facts and reason.  You obviously fattened too long at the table of eminent
Russian diplomats like Kruschev, or even the brooding Brezenev.
If you must practice barbarism, go ahead --but go home. Life is
short enough without a constant stream of filth and errors from
an obviously small, illiterate, and undisciplined mind.
Now, concerning the completely ignorant, erroneus, and  slanderous
comment of Dimitri, the facts will follow the usual disclaimer:

    *******************************************************************
now, back to our regularly scheduled programming the following is a compilation of information which is as reasonable a representation of the foul deed as I could assemble.
 Mountain Meadows Summary Regardless of whatever the facts, fears, and motives; under pressure
from the Paiute Indians, who had already surrounded the wagons, Mountain Meadows remains as the sole instance of an essentially unprovoked attack which possibly may have been assisted by a few Mormons; Mormons
who rarely even raised arms to defend themselves, and who trusted in the Lord to protect and preserve them. the wagon train in question at Mountain Meadows, which is
about 10-15 miles south of Enterprise and 40 miles northwest of
St. George on the Spanish Trail was beseiged by the Paiute Indians who had tolerated the wagon trains for many years.  However, this
train was insufficiently provisioned and they plundered both the Indians and the few settlers in the region for provisions. With at least 50 armed and mounted men, they were a significant force in the region at that time.
The Paiutes called on the local Mormons to help destroy them, or face attack from the Indians themselves.  Perceiving the wagon train as part of the general threat to their community, John D. Lee alledgedly lured them from their wagon train and the Paiute murdered all but a few of the children.
However, given the continued persecution of the Saints for almost
thirty years, persecution which even followed them to vast empty lands
of the Utah Desert, the belief the wagon train was a group of prior
persecutors from Missouri, and the imminent presence of a full United States Army to occupy Utah, there was substantial and justifiable fear among Lee and his fellow settlers.
The true facts of John D. Lee's actual involvement in the Massacre will
never be known.  There is no positive indication that anyone other than
Lee was involved; the community he founded immediately shunned him, even to the point of threats and ostracizing his children. Given John D.
Lee's fervor, he may have made the decision himself, therefore assuming the responsibility in the eye of a very biased federal territorial judge sent from Washington to enforce new federal laws which encompassed
confiscation of Mormon property and dissolving the church. Despite Lee's denials, and no material witnesses of fact. John D. Lee was tried
a second time and executed more than ten years after the incident. It is recorded that Jon D. Lee walked to his execution at Mountain
Meadows after his bitter final declaration, saying to his executioners:
    "...aim for the heart, boys.  Don't sully the flesh."
Unfortunately, the Mountain Meadows is always one of the first items printed; in this case, even of questionable historical accuracy, after the usual overstated references to polygamy without regard for the economic and social necessity of the extended families in a society
with so many more widowed and unmarried women then there were men, to assemble complete family units.       Polygamy, for instance,  existed in the Old Testament times,
basically for the same reasons, and with basically similar rules.   John D. Lee Biography    John D. Lee - Last Words      NOW, LET'S KEEP THIS OFF THE LIST.  join the newsgroup

    ------
        pro-GAK?   either me or the average Utahn?   really?            no way.          other than Salt Lake City area which might be more pro-GAK,
    which were it not for Temple Square, etc. could be just any other
    large city with a Mormon MINORITY.  the population influx asking     to be able to join our safe communities and values has not only     changed the balance of power in favour of outsiders, but the     outsiders brought their social problems (gangs, drugs, morals, etc.)
    with them.   and maybe willing to trade their freedoms for     temporary security.  surprised?
        ask questions before you quote me (or anyone) as to their     position on constitutional matters.  your innuendos and depravity
    is unworthy of any educated Western individual, or do you not
    consider yourself a Western intellectual?  maybe you really are     only capable of playing the Vodka sotted Russian fool?  where is
    your dancing bear?
        I think I have more than a few credentials for being anti
    anything the Feds propose on curbing the Bill of Rights and the
    Constitution  --including more than several visits from the boys     in grey trench coats in the early morning, and being arrested and
    charged by the Feds with both crypto and 'trading with the enemy'     --the fear of public disclosure is what stops them from going even
    to indictment.  and, I endured one of their standard forms of pay-
    back, at a personal price we shall not discuss.
        a man is considered lucky if he has one true friend when he is
    down and being kicked by the Feds;  I found a virtual army of good
    people, many outside my immediate ward, who not only did not turn
    their backs, but actively supported; many not even knowing what     the fight was about, let alone understanding it other than not
    only my rights, but theirs as well, were be trampled upon by the     Feds.          do you have any friends like that?         --to you, that is a loaded question which  probably should     been framed as '...do you have any friends?'              but I shall give you the benefit of the doubt.

.Mark Twain had some very negative things to say about your criminal cult.
.
        WRONG, read the entire article.  in the balance he was rather     positive in his "review" of the Mormons, particularly family life     and work ethic.  the first part of his rambling was critical more
    from the very negative attitude to the Mormons in MIssouri at
    the time Samuel Clemmons was growing up.  The three bloody marches
    in winter with a loss of over 6,000 lifes were less than 10 years     history in his childhood.
        One of our most basic beliefs in the 13 Articles of Faith
    (in addition to the ten commandments) is that we believe everyone
    should be allowed to practice the religion of their choice, any     religion, as they wish to observe;  we only ask the same of them.
        For instance, when the Catholic Church established a parish in
    Salt Lake City, they had no meeting place.  Brigham Young granted
    them the free use of the Tabernacle on Temple Square why they were
    raising money to build their own church.
        The same was true in St. George; the classic tabernacle at
    main & tabernacle was used free of charge by the Catholics until
    they were able to erect their own church, school, etc at 200 N 300W,
    two blocks down the street from Brigham Young's winter residence.
        I have never believed we have been persecuted for religion.
        the work ethic, and the extended 'ward' family, where everyone
    cooperated on advancing the community --for instance, one family
    took the responsibility of making soap (nasty job which takes time)
    for everyone, and so on.  This is cooperative "husbandry"/industry,     and it was beneficial to everyone; there are numerous others.
        even today, our wards are organized so individual families
    have a "skill" for the ward should we find ourselves isolated
    in a wall street disaster, a natural disaster, or whatever.
        do you have 3 years of food storage?  almost 4,000 lbs.
    and 9,000 gallons of drinking water for 3 years for a family of      5?  --that's 72,000 lbs (36 tonnes!... ) almost 10,000 cu. ft.
        we work and we share. which means prosperity, which means
    economic success, which usually means stable, cohesive politics.
    and this too often creates not only jealousy and hostility from our
    non-Mormon neighbors, but fear.          therefore, the basest of arguments and untruths are used     against us to justify the quick  annihilation of the "offenders in
    our midst."
        but what inflames the anti-mormon passions the most is the     paid clergy of other organized religions whose employment is     the paid ministry to their flock.  Mormons threaten their jobs;     the mormons have no paid ministry; it is all part of our     "callings" to do the Lord's work.
        The 40,000 young men and women who leave MTC in Provo,     and other training centers, each graduation to scatter to every
    country in the world, have earned their *own* money to support     themselves on their two year missions. these young men and     women return with unbelievably positive attitudes and the     satisfaction they earned the money themselves --which took     planning and perseverance.
        Dimitri, try reading a balanced analysis of the LDS faith, the
    teachings, and their accomplishments before you jump off and prove
    your ignorance and bigotry...  it will not harm you, and you might
    be surprised at what you learn, particularly "forgiving those who
    trespass against us."  -no retaliation.
        remember, all members are missionaries in a way; noone will
    *ask* you to join. all we do is offer you the opportunity to     *investigate* our beliefs and our community.  After *you* study
    the materials and ask questions, it is up to you to get on your     knees and ask the Lord if you should join.  We neither ask nor
    tell you you will die an agonizing death, again and again in     eternity, if you do not join.  everyone is there own free agent,
    and we can not influence your "free agency"  --we will not
    pursue you if your prayers are not answered; but we will still be
    you friend, and our offer to participate in our services and our
    activities is still extended.
        For instance, I will never attack you with hate speech, and     even my sarcasm is questionable, despite the fun a good play on     words provides;  you could probably snitch me off to my bishop and
    I would likely face a church council.  As a high priest, that is a     serious matter.
        something else you probably do not know:  we NEVER pass the
    plate at any service.  tithing is a private matter.

.
        dont worry, there has never been a book burning in Utah --even     when it was fashionable in the East for almost two centuries.      anyone who advocates book burning in Utah is not LDS.
        the LDS church does not disseminate a list of proscribed
    literature, and does not actually 'preach' anything other than
    what we consider 'acceptable' morality.  everyone has their own
    "free agency" and if they are practicing, certainly understand
    what those standards mean.  personally, I see nothing wrong with
    nudity, but R pictures have starting to approach what was X and
    is now NC-17 (under 16) --and NC-17 now includes almost what was
    XXX.
        the Church does not dictate, nor actually moralize --each     individual is left with their own responsibility and the impending
    review of their mortal life.
.I suppose I'm chagrinned that a thread I named, "Utah as a Religious Police
.State," has been followed by *so many* religious flames, pro- and con-
.Mormonism. (I use Mormonism as shorthand for LDS...sosumi.)
.
        tim, at the end (instead of here where it probably belongs) is
    some extended food for thought on how a corrupt Fed regulates
    thought and action --starting in the 1800s, proving that the party
    in power, even in a supposed democratic republic, still dictates
    what you will read, think, and practice.  the more I study (what is
    now --going on since I started school in 1945), the more cynical
    I become of human nature and the abuse men have permitted
    from whatever government extant.          if you think about it, the actions against the LDS in the 1800s
    is very little different than the power hungry, corrupt Feds of     today who are attacking the Bill of Rights as obsolete in the
    face of todays terrorism (is it so different from any before except
    it is faster and deadlier?).
        In our (LDS) terms I refer to the Feds as the Gadianton robbers
    who were the insidious 'mafia' which usurped government power     under the guise of 'law and order' in a period of the book of     Mormon...
        --or even the Pharisees (the temple money changers) of Jesus'     time. The same concept of the Pharasees is still practiced by the     Jewish faith today.   (another comment on today's pharisee's --a
    truly amazing eye opener, towards the end). .My point was not to attack Mormonism, esp. the religious beliefs.
.
        No, I sure it was not --but you may have been the only one!  .Personally,
.I think cults are useful in keeping people off the streets (better than
.police-enforced curfews). I was mainly challenging Attila's glowing opinion
.of how his community "enforces curfews big time." .
        Frankly, we do not wish curfews, and there never were curfews     before the immense immigration into the area, mostly from So. CA,
    over the last 15 years which changed St. George from the small     town of less than the 5,000 in 1970 when I left St. George, to the
    almost 30,000 when I came home within the last year.          I chose not to actually return to St. George, where a two lane
    main drag had been changed from a two lane, tree line "road"     to a glitzed 4 lanes plus center lane boulevard, instead moving
    North to the rural high desert  (we have no legislated curfew).
        St. George today is not Mormon dominated politics, but the
    bulk of the immigrants expected to find, and maintain, that small
    town innocence --which they have more or less done.         However, these people, Mormons (some good, some inactive) and
    non-Mormans alike, unfortunately brought with them the alien     cultural they were trying to escape: bored children without super-
    vision, a junk food way of life, dual-income families, and children
    feeling aliented and lost in a world they do not understand --not
    St. George, but the world itself and its television age.
        It was in this atmosphere the "non-homogenous" but somewhat
    like thinking apparently demanded the permanent curfew --there is     absolutely nothing to do by that time, and milling around what
    passes for a mall here (grocery store) was/is not considered
    acceptable.  Secondly, St. George seems to attract an influx of
    3-5,000 high school students at Spring break (it is very warm
    by that time, despite the 3,000 ft  alt)          --but why?  there is nothing here.  they wanted beer, but they
    could not legally buy beer, or rent a hotel room under 18 --does
    not make sense.  so they had a milling, loose crowd of "foreign"
    teenagers.  --just like Sonny Bono, as mayor of Palm Springs,
    found himself with every year: illegal drinking,  convertibles
    with even pre-pubescent girls standing naked on the trunk decks,
    etc.  --don't say "where? where? where!?!
        well, that prompted the curfew, but they found it also     maintained the semblance of peacful family oriented community
    among the lost and alienated families --so it is apparently here
    to stay.  other than the fact we are telling tparents who do not     wish to manage their children they must keep them home or take them
    somewhere, what does the law do? .Telling people when they

.them what they can read and what they cannot.

        that was my initial reaction -you wouldn't tell me that!  but     consider the right of society to legislate and  regulate in the     common good, despite both my and your abhorence of law in an of
    itself.          it is an effective means of forcing parents who do not seem to     care, or parents who wish to shift their responsibilities to social
    workers who are not available, they have a responsibility.  what
    happens to the violators --few are arrested, they are asked to go
    home. there is no great wild-west roundup of teenaged cattle! any
    who resist or commit minor vandalism are taken to the center --but,
        unlike every other city I have seen, they do not mix the     'miscreants' with the juvenile delinquents, repeat offenders, and     the teenagers who are obviously on their way to the dead end.
        what is the penalty?  call their parents for a ride home.  they
    are not fingerprinted and mugged, etc.  very few are required to
    even see a social worker.  consistent repeat offenders eventually
    enter the system --as they should.
.I still urge Attila to rethink his enthusiastic support of state-enforced
.curfews, or state-imposed bans on alcohol (not that I recall him supporting
.this particular law), etc.
        actually, the curfew laws are local laws, and I reluctantly
    decided to support curfew laws for minors after looking at the
    means and results --it does provide an early point of intercepting
    behavioral patterns with the *parent* being the judge and warder,
    and hopefully give those parents a wakeup call they need to guide
    their children as they are fast approaching adulthood where they
    are fully accountable.
        alcohol is available at any large grocery store; it has not been
    banned to any extent since prohibition, but not necessarily avail-
    able in rural areas.          in Salt Lake City and the more heavily populated north, there     are bars.  prior to about 15 years ago, you could brown bag your
    own hard liquor to a restaurant; today restaurants have full     permits.  In St. George there actually is a bar! --you do need to     *know* where to find it (I was told a few weeks ago the area, but     I could care less).
        I do not think you can prohibit anything from adults --drugs,
    prescription or recreational, included --no matter how destructive.
    all 18 of the US code provides is a 'illegalization' of a criminal
    class with enormous financial power --and, worse, a corrupt and
    lawless enforcement agency with an equally corrupt and evil class
    of attorneys to protect both the distributors and the corrupt     opponents  --modern, legal, efficient predatation on a class.         legalize drugs, etc. and the ATF, the DEA, and a host of allied
    agencies which cause billions of dollars per year and provide
    nothing in return will be totally unnecessary (except to snoop for
    paranoid Bubba...)  --even Bubba could enjoy his five lines a day
    and not be in defiance of our legal system!
        and think of the destruction of the narco-terrorist gangs;
    --there would be no money, power, or illicit prestige; no enormous
    slush funds to put Uzis in the hands of an 8 year old, or bribe     cops and politicians.  our urban decay and combat zones would be
    boring --some might find it necessary to even learn enough to be
    able to watch a robomachine do the work!  this is beginning to     sound like utopia.
        so why do we not legalize dope?  simple: George Bush's income
    stream would dry up along with the literally thousands of other
    supposedly law-abiding politicians who are on the gravy train!
        take away the illicit profits for Congress and we might even     an honest reformer or two in Washington.
        certainly we are justified in ranting against any abridgement of     our right to freely (and privately) communicate, freedom of     *peaceful* assembly, a truly free press --certainly not the New     World Order blinded press printing the official line dictated by
    political/economic Boss Tweeds of what is effectively an oligarchy     --they do not possess common principles sufficient to even be
    called 'national socialists' (fascists).         or, there is a government like Washington where they are trying
    to, and may anyway, implement President Hillary's "It takes a     Global Village" so the state can dictate everything and raise a new
    generation of robots in the mold of their revisionist history which
    we are now suffering by attrition....           If Bubba and the President are reelected with a Democratic     Congress, we will not recognize our once almost free country in
    the space of a few short years.  Bubba is a space cadet political
    wonder  -the front man, wandering in his drug induced sub-space;
    Hillary is a the intelligent, crafty, 60s idealist socialist     liberal --dedicated and determined to impose her order at whatever
    expense of liberty necessary.
        or, Hillary's social order which plays directly into the hands     of the NWO, the very rich, old family elitists.  first the cradle to
    the grave thought control welfare state; and entire amorphous
    classes of thoughtless drones  --then comes the changes for the
    survival of the human race: the total disenfranchisement of major
    components of the underclass, and the establishment of an effec-
    tively feudal structure with a serf labor pool.
        or, the disturbing trend of an almost exponentially increasing
    prisoner class who are being shifted to prisons run by defense
    contractors who are permitted to "employ" them at minimum wage;
    paying WH, FUTA, FICA, and all that good stuff; and taking all but
    chump change for their room and board.  Today that decuction
    does not cover their actual confinement, but we can obviously rest
    assured the defense contractors will take the burden off the tax-
    payers (at what cost human suffering) *and* make a profit!         in other words, encouraging the breakdown of the classic     American family actually benefits the NWO by providing a lawless
    element which can be imprisoned for profit, and reduce the birth
    rate simultaneously --what a benefit!

some historical thought on why lack of religious freedom:
        actually, when you look back in history, what was it that just just
    lit the fires in Washington which provoked the Feds to even
    legislate laws which contravened the whole concept of what the
    Constitution stands for --laws which literally dissolve the Church
    a legal entity, confiscated Church property in excess of $50,000
    [not that much by 1875], revoked woman's suffrage in Utah
    (Wyoming (which is heavily, though not predominantly Mormon,
    at that time enacted woman's suffrage first in the nation a few
    months before Utah), disenfranchised all officials of the Church,
    and any members practicing polygamy?
        other than the fact a number of territorial governors after
    the first one sent from Washington with Johnson's Army (trapped
    at Fort Bridger) who was gracious and therefore replaced by some
    pretty vicious and greedy slimeballs who transmitted messages to a
    very distant Washington of "rebellion" by armed and dangerous     outlaws, what was it?
        utah was a land no-one, including many of Brigham Young's
    followers wanted, but they had transformed a very inhospitable land
    into a virtual land of plenty.         even though Brigham Young was replaced as governor in 1858 by     the territorial governors from Washington, the Church was both
    monolithic and defensive --understandably.
The Pharisees are alive and well today:
            in my previous ward in California, the LDS chapel was "leased"     gratis, other than janitorial fees, (including totally rearranging our     own worship schedules to accommodate) to one Jewish temple's     overflow for the Rosh Hosana (sp?) and Yom Kipper holidays.
        their advance guard 'required' six hours to set up and I was
    still in our ward offices (member of the bishopric)  at the start...
    they litterally set up two rows of _money changing_ tables at the
    entrance (tables you must pass between); they had sold tickets of
    admission; and the seats in the chapel were sold like opera     tickets: priced according to location.          OK, that's their deal, I thought --so what?  but curiosity got
    the better of me, and I asked one of their people who appeared
    to be approachable about the seating --it was he who informed me
    of the price schedule --the front area seating was $10,000 per
    seat --anything moving into our multicultural hall (gym, etc.) which
    has acoustical 'curtains' between the chapel was still >$500!  I
    did not have the courage to ask what it cost to sit upon the dias!

.
        come, come, John...   you would deny those bright, eager faces
    of our missionaries, who spent several years earning the money to be
    able to support themselves on a two year mission?
        and, they do not "ask" you to join our religion;  they are only
    offering you the chance to "investigate" our religion; your decision to
    join is based solely on your willingness to pray, by yourself,     asking the Lord if joining the Church of Jesus Christ and the Latter
    Day Saints is the _right_ thing to do, a true Church of Jesus and
    the Lord.           It is not for our missionaries to ask you to join the Church;     they are only to assist you in your _investigation_ of our Church.
    Don't worry, I realize some overreach their mission authority with
    their enthusiasm.          However, if you are ever pushed by a missionary, send his/her     name to me and I will pass the information along to the mission     leadership that they might pause and potentially dampen his/her     fire a little bit.  it happens, as to be expected.          BTW, the mission leaders are adult couples who volunteer for     3 years. we had a man in our ward who was close to 70 accept a     calling with his wife to oversee land acquistion and construction     all over the Far East --he was out there almost 10 years -- he and     his wife had 11 children and he is now close to 90 --still going     (falls asleep in his chair after dinner....).
       please just remember these kids are filled with their youthful     zeal and the exuberance of their mission.  they are some of our     best kids, and they are giving two years (10% of their life to date)
    for their service.  I really regret that I did not go on a mission at
    19 --interrupting college for 2 years.   Harvard had no provision
    for it, and I surrendered my chance over 37 years ago. .If the LDS church would just give up this damnable proselytizing, I'd find
.you no more objectionable than the Tibetan Buddhists (whom I actually hold in
.rather high regard, .
        our Articles of Faith include the missions.  our first     missionaries covered amazing distances in the mud, and generally on
    foot starting in 1830, the year the Church was founded, covering     much of the Eastern U.S. and Canada plus very rewarding missions     to England, Europe, Scandinavia, and even to Australia/NZ/Tahiti in     the first 15 years.  there is an enormous population of LSD members
    in the Solomon Island area today.
        and we belief that everyone should be permitted to practice
    religion in any way they choose (or not choose), only asking that     we be shown the same consideration.  we will even fight to grant
    you that right!  or give you, without cost, the use of our chapels
    if you do not have your own.  For instance, the Catholic Church
    managed to start their congregations in Utah by using our chapels
    in the 1850s.
.although they're never going to convert me either!)
.
        try investigating and see if you still can make that     statement!         what would you do if you found yourself "volunteering" to     accept the LDS faith?
.-jcr
.PS:  I do think it's a Good Thing that mormons don't pay the clergy. .
        accepting the call to be the Bishop is an enormous responsi-
    bility, sometimes without much encouragement in some wards
    where there are spiritual or family problems above the norm. We
    are not perfect.
.One positive for LDS.  Did you pick up that idea from the Ba'ha'i?
        I seriously doubt it; Joseph Smith never would have known about

        2000 years ago, the wag Marcellus said: "...the lowest element

.         essentially, assault weapons are illegal; in california (where     else), the possesion of a weapon with a flash suppressor is illegal;
    as is possesion of the older 10 shot clips for the .223 class     weapons (not to mention the 20 and 30 shot clips or the double     sided bananas at 40!).
        the government is just being realistic  --why should they grant
    us a right which we might use to protect our constitutional rights
    and topple their corrupted government?
        crap!       --or, maybe galloping prairie muffins!
        I'm not sure I want my neighbors to park a loaded panzer in     their front yard...   or indulge in clipping every midnight     (exhausting a clip in wanton fire)...  or store 5+ gallons of liquid
    nitroglycerin (which should be interesting in our 120 degree
    summer heat)...
        my neighbors and I might be justified in gently placing one big
    mutha of a blast mat over the neighbors property --even if that
    might be prior restraint, but to go so far as to say let's kill him
    before anything happens is certainly preempting his rights.
        unfortunately, those are the same arguments our imperious     government uses to justify limiting or prohibiting our personal     armaments, no matter how small.  even BB guns are facing regulation
    now....          ...and to think I received my very own .22 rifle and 4-10X     scope for my sixth birthday!  the life expectancy of the local     'herd' of jack rabbits took a sudden nose-dive!  by 10 I had a     semi-automatic and the ratio fell again --multiple kills before     the field was clear!  the arrival of the .223s years later made it     exciting --the explosive level suddenly became satisfying!

        as tanatlizing the argument for AP may be, it is a childish
    and petty display, a temper tantrum: the cowardly exercise     of revenge.
        very little, in anything, warrants revenge; there are needs to     redress legitimate wrongs, and therefore ways.  what has     fundamentally gone wrong in our society is there is little justice,
    particularly v/v our corrupt elected officials and their     paymasters; and execution takes over 10 years by the time     every bleeding heart tries an appeal for the occasionally condemned.
        Big Ed Davis, who preceded Daryll Gates as LA police chief,
    had a perfect solution for airline hijackers:
         Big Ed Davis actually parked a long semi-trailer in front of     the American terminal at LAX for the purpose:  at the front was     the judge's dias, a jury box along one side, lawyers opposite,     and a gallows at the far end.          there would be an immediate trial by selecting a jury of 12 of
    his peers, chosen as they cleared the arriving flight doors,  and     even places for the 3 judge appeal required by CA capital punish-
    ment laws.
        very efficient --and it would not cost the state $10-15 MILLION
    to execute just one criminal.  --the execution would be public,     obviously, immediately after the appeal!  I mean, you could do the     whole deed and serve justice on your lunch hour!           you should have heard the liberals scream about what was     nothing less than poetic justice!  even a jury of his peers, real
    peers!
        Big Ed left it parked in front of American until the ACLU filed
    and successfully obtained a permanent injunction against him.           Big Ed was a bit colorful ; interesting; and definitely not     unintelligent --he was my CA state Senator for years after retiring     from the force.          Anybody wanna guess his party affiliation? --at one time he     was on the ballot as both a republican and a libertarian.         you should hear Big Ed on privacy issues --he makes all of you
    sound like lost jacklegs and pikers.

        CAVEAT:  under no conditions could I ever condone Jim Bell's
    Assassination Politics --it may be anarchistic in and of itself, but
    it is a thinly disguised criminal amentality, not only from the     extant of trying to 'moralize' murder, but a form of power politics
    (and shadow government) which actually exceeds the abuses of our

    Not only is revenge politics immoral, but AP is a corruption of     society by lawless and arbitrary behavior of a few players who can

.However, there are certain things my phone company does *not* do. They don't
.keep _copies_ (recordings) of my phone conversations. .
        true, so far
.This means a court
.order can't yield copies of past conversations.
.
        true, so far
.They also don't track
.incoming phone calls to me. (I don't believe such records of incoming phone
.calls are kept; maybe I'm wrong. Certainly with Caller ID, storing incoming
.phone numbers is possible....I just don't think local or regional phone
.companies care about such records, and hence don't bother to accumulate
.them.)
.
        Not true.  they *do* track incoming calls, including caller ID, etc
    even if blocked by the originating customer; even pay phones give
    out their ID which means if the callee is tapped, they have the caller's
    location in a flash by reverse reference.     Caller ID of blocked senders is available to anyone who wants to     read it.  the  "disable" bit can be programmed out of existence if
    anti-privacy snooping is your business ( you can modify software     and/or firmware in most of the the WinTel hardware platform     add-ons for phones to do so).
.Now, should the phone company keep such records, they would be accessible via
.court order.
.
        Sure are; and they are there.
.My point? ISPs are currently in a position to turn over *far* more
.information than phone companies are able to turn over. It's as if the phone
.companies kept audio recordings of all conversations, without even the need
.for law enforcement to do a wiretap or pen register or whatnot. It would be
.trivial for law enforcement to say: "Phone Company, here's a subpoena/court
.order for the last 6 months of phone conversations Tim May has had. Please
.ship the tapes via FedEx."
.
        exactly;  recording of calls is not done without a court order
    --or an LEO operative having a buddy or bribee in the switch room.
        besides, LEOs do not wiretap suspects without a court order     (really)  --but they *do* just happen to talk loud enough in certain
    places about wanting that information (including inbound CallerID),
    that whatever information is desired is handed over by a snitch for
    the usual 30 shekals, or more.
.This makes the ISP case a bit different. Not legally, but technologically.
.
        Unfortunately, the same "problem" applies here --the ISPs can be
    ordered to keep logs of mail traffic.  So far, the fact this is not     current Fed policy is what permits our remailer networks to     operate at all.  If remailers were required to keep logs --of what
    value would remailers be?
        Obviously, this not mean that some brain-dead Fed, Jamie Gorelick
    for example, will not ask Congress to attach a rider to some other bill
    which will pass with high numbers  --remember the "manager's mark"
    which added the CDA provisions we object to after the House voted
    410-2 for no-CDA?
.There are some fixes.
.
        valid only until the Feds order ISPs to log, and to whatever level.
. [snip]
.(Recall that Ollie North thought he had deleted his incriminating White House
.PROFS messsages, but that they were faithfully preserved on backup tapes, and
.could be retrieved.)
.
        sure makes a good argument for ZIP drives does it not?
            --of course, supposing PRZ did not sell out to get off,      the messages should have started our with PGP --you can always
    lose a keyring           or, have a second internal file which is non-incriminating     which pops up with the dummy key --talks about your kids or     whatever.  that and pray your recipient gets the decoded message
    off his disks pronto.  would not take much to modify PGP to be
    two (or split) keyed.  of course, we might as well shift over to
    the newer lattice crypto theories and up the price to play.
        or, interleaving which is a particularly nasty means of playing
    the game  -it gets their attention real fast;  been there and seen
    the two grey suits at the door at 5 am a few times --unpleasant
    men.
        or, as I do with all mail, despite the small fraction I consider     sensitive:   all inbound mail goes to a ZIP disk --decoding,     including tmp files, is on the ZIP --I may even switch to JAZ and
    keep the archives on optical (which is also a lot faster).
.[snip...] .(* Prepaid phone cards, paid for in cash, and payphones, tell us that True
.Names are not needed with the phone companies. And so on.)
        so far, this is one of the few freebies we have, but is it a
    freebie long?         with the new digital wiretap provisions and sophisticated     speech reconition, the Feds can scan and monitor active payphones
    and still have their cake after they have eaten your rights.
.We don't have to make it easy for them.

@_subject: is there no end to AP & Creative Wiretap Arguments? 
after months of patient explanations to Jim Bell and     sympathizers, going over the same points in 31 flavours,
    the same arguments of what I would call "respectable" anarchy     (well stated by Tim May) rather than the "world at war" anarchy of     Jim Bell --  where are we?!?
        I read Jim's first "manifesto" at least 18 months ago; and, the
    "refined manifsto" less than a month ago.  I have yet to see an     application of civilization which brings AP society up to even the     level of Tombstone AZ just prior to the OK Corral.
        Jim's theories all hinge on betting pools which supposedly can
    be run like the lottery where the poor can share a ticket     (egalitarian, of course), anonyminity (which as an argument is     appropriate, but what for in a selfish immoral act?),  and a     justice is served attitude, even if there are mistakes.
        the whole concept of AP does not even support the concept of
    "justice is expeditiously served!"   it is a resort to the manners
    of dogs and monkeys sitting at the same table --a spiteful,     arrogant player can move the betting pools to assassinate anyone.
        In other words, are we planning to use James Caan as the lead
    runner in "Roller Ball"  --except this time we're playing with a     "live" society for which we hold in common the utmost contempt?          are we trying to return to the bread and circus mentality of     Rome on its deathbed and slide to subjecation by Attila the Hun     who was actually stopped from sacking Rome after the Pope so     impressed him with his regal robes....  deciding  tribute from an     established dictatorship was more reliable?  --and less costly?!?
        has anyone seen a single social moral fiber in Jim's often     passionate arguments for AP, or even in the "results" in a society
    which will never breed another leader: religious, secular, or even
    political?          does AP permit anything except slaves and drones which can     just as easily be replaced by robots?  maybe noone will miss news
    reports (as 'canned' as they are), or movies which entertain or     provoke?  or ice cream sundaes at the soda fountain?
        ...and the disappearance of grocers, and doctors, and dentists
    bringing forth a new age of subsistence farming and hunting for     the lucky few who might live to a readjusted live expectancy point
    of 30 yrs, burning books and computer printouts for cooking and     warmth.
        why have books or knowledge when there is noone willing to
    accept the responsibility of educating your children, the instructor
    waiting for the parent of Dumb Suzy to avenge her failing grade?      after all, Suzy does not need to read, not even well enough to     take the test for a driver's license --there is no infrastructure;
    no need to learn math well enough to possibly balance a checkbook
    --after all, there are no banks...
        well, killing for my country was once my civic duty;  I never     killed in revenge --there was no need, we never left enough living
    for them to attempt their revenge.          was it desensitizing, yes.  killing is just another days work...
        would I even consider doing it again for our "proud and just"     republic?  what "proud and just" republic? it has not even had
    the resemblence of a republic, let alone "proud and just" since
    Stanton and his crony Cotton arranged the assassination of
    Lincoln --it only cost Cotton $50,000.          sacrificing 55,000 men and frying the brains of another
    1.5 million solely to fatten the industrial war machine?   using
    John Foster Dulles' "domino theory" to justify the carnage...         to bad I was still of an era which said 'you will serve if called'
    and so stupid to take almost six years to get out.  Would you     serve a country today which is rotten to the core?
        "Assassination Politics" is nothing more than a childish game
    which 'legalizes' killing anyone you wish.  are AP's proponents so     naive they believe the bookies will not have any public person     assassinated by rigging the pools for their own profit?  remember,
    law enforcement ceased with the return of 'law of the jungle'     anarchy.          AP has already decided the people are free to return to the     savage jungle where the big cats hunt for food, and man hunts for
    pleasure.
        Jim Bell has amused us long enough --an average of 10-15
    messages a day; every thread being convoluted to included the
    aspects of Assassination Politics  --the all encompassing AP.
        PURE CRAP!
        arguing AP in any form is just another case of mental     masturbation, and the old story still applies:              "if you are arguing with a fool;                 look in the mirror before you continue!"
        or as brock says:

In <3.0b19.32.19961015115525.0067560c at panix.com>, on 10/15/96    at 11:57 AM, Duncan Frissell  said:
.>I'm of course just a layman, not a law professor or scholar. But I feel it
.>best that we not invoke a "right to privacy" to protect our crypto
.>abilities, when such a "right" apparently does not exist.
.>However, certain things which _look_ like a "right to privacy" do
.>exist:
.
.I agree with your analysis.  It certainly matches what I was taught in
.law school.  The rhetorical point I was making however is that a
.*practical* not constitutional right to privacy exists as long as your
.questioner eschews torture.          I disagree. the law school concept which I remember (given that     it was thirty-five years ago) was that privacy, although stated in
    many manifestos as a right, even an inalienable right, is solely the
    amount of privacy and freedom of invasion as granted in the Bill of
    Rights, and that in turn is subject to interpretation by the courts
    as it applies to a series of cases --i.e. the principal is stated
    in the Bill of Rights, but the case law continues to evolve and     shape the _limitations_ of government intrusion into your privacy     (actually, the decisions have generally reduced your privacy).
        BTW, this was McCracken's course in constitutional law at     Harvard.
        As we are aware:             the fifth has been destroyed by being held in contempt.
            the fourth has been gutted with all the no-knock cases.
            the second is abridged by registration, prohibitions,             licensing, disenfranchisement, etc.  the only thing  they             have not done is quarter troops in our houses...
            the first sort of stands, but consider that the right
            to privacy and the freedom of speech should also include
            the right NOT to speak --that has been gutted by the
            rulings on the fifth.
            no point discussing the rest of them --they're mostly
            ignored or cases are channeled into 1, 2, 4 and 5.
        of course, the one I object to is 14 which basically steals our     unlimited rights to our state citizenships.  after six years doing
    the real dirty work of deep-black ops in the 60s --I never again     wish to consider myself a "national U.S. citizen."  Thank you, my     Utah citizenship will do just fine!  and, no, I do not vote in     Federal elections.
        Eschewing torture, for instance, is a limitation of the     prosecutorial "effort" which can be applied in interrogation. For
    instance, the right to representation was not established with
    the approval of the Bill of Rights --it was a much later Supreme
    Court which said counsel _must_ be provided, which further expanded
    to "...the accused has a right to _effective_ counsel" (which, of
    course, is a joke considering the case load of the public     defenders who plea bargain or let it go to conviction).
.I think it is useful to point out -- in response to government types
.who assert that "there's no absolute right to privacy" --that they .have actually set aside a zone of privacy by their rejection of .torture as an interrogation technique.
.
        Even though the Miranda act requires a "prisoner" to be read his
    rights (rights? Captain Kirk?), it does not preclude an overwhelming
    force of SWAT team members which has just crashed through the     house unannounced (let's not start that thread again) from rounding     up a man's family, naked, or close to naked, and start putting
    handcuffs on women and children.  Any man's (worth his salt) normal
    reaction is: "What the fuck are you assholes doing to my wife? --she
    had nothin' to do with it!"
        Bingo! The victim, innocent or not, has just admitted he is     guilty of something.  presuming they read the victim his Miranda
    before they starting abusing and terrifying (not far from torture is
    it?), the "admission of guilt" is fully qualified evidence, despite     the fact it may or may not have any relation to the case at hand     --and it will be read to the jury by some straight faced liar, sworn
    to by one of the belligerents whose paycheck is justified by his
    kill ratio.
        BTW, if they had not read 'em Miranda, they'll stand up and     swear they did anyway.  and who do you think is believed?
        And that is just the beginning --yes, they may be required by     law to grant you a phone call --but when?  in the federal system,     even if they have a detention area available, they are not required
    to give you phone call until they have booked you in the
    state/county holding facility (or even an MCC) --you can even be
    taken before the magistrate to determine bail and to be charged and
    still not have a telephone call. And, they can delay the hearing,
    and therefore the call --the favourite trick is to slide it over     the weekend. You have just appeared before the magistrate without
    the representation you might have been able to contact  --and they
    are not required to provide a public defender at a charge hearing.
        that is not "torture?"  personally, I consider physical torture     a wasted effort in today's world; but nothing outlaws emotional     terror, and being held without communication, with various federales
    passing you back and forth and asking for your name, etc. and
    accusing you of whatever, and making comments about your family,
    your history, your race, your religion.  falsehoods, falsehoods, and
    more "why did you do that? --didn't you know you could go to jail
    for life?  --right know we only have you charged with six counts at 5
    years each, but there are others.  --why don't you come clean?  --we
    can let you plead on just one charge which will cost you the 5 years
    at most --21 months with good time..."
        that is just the beginning of psychological torture. If they are
    criticized, whatever, the prisoner ends up in the "hole"  --despite     the fact certain standards are required by law, some holes are
    literally that --pitch black with one drain in the center of the
    floor; buck naked, including women (they spill the beans faster);
    two meals a day of a couple slices of bread, a slice of junk baloney
    [sic] if you are lucky.  why the hole?  dangerous in the general
    population; whatever. denial of privileges: visits, telephones, even
    legal visitation until "hole time" is up.
        think I'm putting you on?  want a list of a few jails which have
    facilities worse than what I described?
        no they cannot physically torture, but they can put your     intelligent, educated, civilized little white ass in with some some
    real sweet boyfriends, or sadists, or racists who are just waiting
    for revenge, or just plain killers "--oops, made a classification
    error;" and the tag on your toe says: "john doe         and nothing prevents them from talking about poor Harry who did     not cooperate...

    rich are narrowing our margins as they steal from 99% of the
    population, and *maybe* they need to be curtailed, in not

        I dunno, James...         so where do you draw the line?  Isn't most anyone who accepts

    not? --they are, after all, selling their principles for the
    proverbial loaf of bread.
        I agree there can be stupidity --Americans, in particular, with
    30% functionally illiterate are more often stupid and uninformed
    than most members of the industrial world, However, even these
    "mentally challenged" (note the politically correct terminology)
    sloths (not very PC) have the one eyed monster telling them all the
    truth their masters wish them to hear.  we do not have political
    consultants and advertising agencies --we have PR teams.
        since the usurpers of the public trust don't allow me to enter:     "none of the above" I have never voted --I'm just waiting for the     time the politicals stage an election and noboy votes  --that is one
    of the few means of telling them we dont like what any of the     stooges will actually do when elected.

    that is expecting a jump call of some sort.  we haven't yet     fallen into the impending insecure abyss of MS objects.
        to have a piece of code embedded execute, a "start-up"     program would need to be previously passed to the target     machine which literally scanned all memory for the startup
    sequence in the foreign material --and translate it.
        on unix, the code would need to be sophisticated enough     to remove itself from the process table --even in sleep
    modes.
        and, in any system, the startup sequence must be     readable, and therefore traceable by anti-virus routines.
        now that kickboxed has baited the hook for trolling, what

MS had a substantial investment in SCO when the old man     was screwing things up (before the old man was forced out     for sexual harassment --his brother had long since raped      Convergent and was gated).         MS had made the V7 deal with Western Electric with Billy      thinking he had an exclusive on **the** way to go --better      than sliced bread; V7 was not commercially available --only to        universities because of a WE consent decree with the government.       Billy was in seventh heaven --sure he had the deal of a lifetime!         not so: Bell Labs shortly announced the breakup and      decided to commercially ship System III --it was available     in source code only, but the price was only about $25K in      the first go around, and you could produce binaries for     sublicensing for $250 or some such --it was not a great     price, but it was doable.  System III was not restricted to     64K plus 64K.           One of my major conract customers at the time was WE      --System V R2 was already available internally, including a      decent VAX port (unlike the really piss-poor V32 Berkeley      rewrote into BSD 4.2 --offering it back to Bell Labs for      free, which was spurned from the Ivory Tower at Murrey Hill...)         With the WE and AT&T breakup, and the multiple licensing      activity, Gates hit the roof --threw several well known major      temper tantrums, including at least one at WE/Labs that I am     directly aware of.  Gates vowed to bury UNIX in all flavours     and has had that intention ever since  --non-stop.           Billy-boy does not carry a grudge lightly --he not only     gets very mad and comes off the wall (or handle), but he has     every intention of getting even.  I've always figured Billy      suffers from Tourette's for his mannerisms, his      uncontrollable rage, &c. --just has not learned to manage it,     and figured his Daddy could solve it all --and now there is      an item of $10billion give or take a few --buys a lot of hate.         part of Billy's vindictive plan against AT&T involved     hiring Dave Cutler from DEC --Cutler was the self-styled     leader of the VMS team, also with a bad case of temper-tantrums         I saw dave literally shatter an impossible to break WE      500 series telephone simply by "hanging" it up....   (...time     to clear the decks!)  and that was for NT --great job!  Cutler     took the deal thinking he had a free hand --at Billy's place?     --naive. and Dave had to put up with the Windows legacy...       the crap that goes on inside NT is not all Cutler's direct fault.         and that is Billy Boy and the SCO club...  and death      lurking in the alley for unix --but I doubt he will be able      to kill it --there is just too large a crowd of      professionals who refuse to use MS --not just because the      product is crap, but because of Billy. = > > This is for single user home based UNIX systems.  = >   = > Single-user UNIX isn't all that useful.  =           matter of opinion --works fine,          just like the big guys, on a workstation.  so it limits      you to one login  -???  runs full multi-tasking re-entrant      just like multi-user. somewhere along the line, you were      standing behind the door and forgot to listen when single      user limitations were defined. = Listen to the guys who built it.

Listen to the guys who built it.           apparently you never figured out there was anything after     SCO's initial releases --they were junk as was their first      several passes at System III and V  -they tried to live with      their Xenix Heritage --including trying to make System III      run on a 286 --an abysmal product.         today SCO is shipping SysV R4+ --the last Labs and Unix      International version which also contains all BSD calls which     were added by SUN under contract --it's a good solid product.         however, despite years of kernal hacking for WE, I still      prefer straight BSD flavours.  Commercially, SUN leads that      pack, followed by DEC with Ultrix which is BSD by another      name...  HP is sort of System V R4+  Even IBM is Unix --they      just call it AIX and it is BSD based --also very solid and      thoroughly supported --you can not even get IBM heavy iron      without AIX --MVS &c. run as processes.         Ken Olsen, founder of DEC, called unix "snake oil."      DEC's VMS is good, but was originally a DCL platform.      security is excellent by comparison to early unix, but it is     not open (or was not, to be correct)  --and source is     virtually out of the question.         FYI, both unix and VMS are derived from Multix...         Today DEC ships Ultrix on everything, and VMS      basically only on the mainframes.  Ken Olsen was forced out      when the sales staff blew Ford Motor Co out of the water on      an immense deal, along with an even larger Fed contract      --essentially the salesmen refused to sell unix (required      in both bid specs) on the hardware....

MS is a pure virus on its own, if not the software, than      certainly the company.         why does MS have 85% of the desktop? --the power of money     and lies --and a loud noisy parade with a bandwagon, free     beer, and all that good stuff that goes with predatory market     practices.         fair competition?  why should MS be fair when its stated      goal is to take a fraction of **every** transaction on any      network.  Billy has no tolerance for the existence of      anything other than Billy's creations and control --total     control.         It does not matter if W95 crashes more often than 3.1     --upgrade it for more money!  Money is the name of the game      at MS, not decent product for a reasonable price.

=If Singapore bans alt.sex.hooters, you could simply post to
=alt.culture.singapore.i.got.your.hooters.right.here.     [snip]
=It would also send the correct message that "newsgroups" are simply
=one of many labels on an article, and are not cyberspacial tearooms
=where bad people congregate and there is guilt by association.
        I don't fault your argument on "sending the correct message,"     but since when has an oppressive government ever been     concerned with "the correct message?"   LEA's could care less     about the message; their only interest is another opportunity to     behave like the jack-booted thugs they generally are.
        but public opinion, certainly the government interests in     control, have already determined in the court of small minds     that "we" are inherently evil (and beyond redemption without     coercion).  A repressive government can not afford publications     from unredeemed (and unrepentant) cyber-anarchists with a     world wide audience.         Is the daily comics the last refuge of freedom; witness     today's "Thatch:"
                "cubicle cliches are one of the few things we             all share; they're one of the few things that unite             us as americans!"
                "that and utter, corrosive contempt for our             elected officials."
        sarcasm has always been a potent weapon, and one of the     hardest to silence. ..in bits and pieces it can slowly undermine
    the target.  why is it tolerated?  I'm sure our malicious uncle     wanted to shut Doonsbury down during Vietnam, but     joe-six-pack rarely understood the underlying message.
=The alternative to doing something reasonable like this is probably
=to see mass migration from "banned newsgroups" to off-topic groups,
=like Lolita pictures in rec.pets.cats, when the inevitable crackdown
        has not the crackdown arrived?  and are not the various     skirmishes between governments on one side and the ISPs &     users on the other sufficient evidence of governmental     intentions?
=As long as people can post
=anonymously, they will simply switch to another existing newsgroup
=when the one they are posting to becomes blocked. Once the =inevitable reciprocal pissing contest between posters and censors =gets going, Usenet as we know it will likely be destroyed.
        let's put it this way, the first reaction will be to     "eliminate" the anonymous remailers, then ban the "alt"     groups which can be created at will.          if there is migration from alt.sex.binaries to rec.cats, the     government will eliminate the entire usenet and we will be     forced back to the NWO controlled media conglomerates,         or mail lists.  of course, then the fascists will block or     close down the list servers on some flimsy pretext such as
    violating the US postal monopoly and regulations....          Many companies block the alt groups; 15 years ago,     even I blocked the alt groups during business hours (and     usenet was only 1.5 MBytes per day then!), restoring them     at 1800.         --why?  because the office staff spent *at least* all     morning reading usenet,  occasionally even refusing to     talk to customers before their daily dose!
        My point is simple:  I reacted by limiting the **time**
    of access, ** not access itself. **          On the other side, Reed, Buchannan &c. have decided
    *they* should judge what is fit (G rated) for our consumption;         and, of course, Big Brother has determined they should
    be the judge of political correctness and all that shit which is        numbing the minds of joe-six-pack until America is a     controllable homogeneous bowl of putrid gruel.
        government, in and of itself, may be able to selectively
    prosecute cyberspace "violaters," but the real danger is big     business.  Print newspapers receive $64 billion in ad revenue,     80% of which is local. Virtually every major US newspaper     (most owned by the group of 5) has a net presence --some     very informative.  And, even Mexico has more than a dozen     of their papers on line.
        However, in the US the news is still the same collection of
    what the NWO wants us to hear/see. So far, the foreign     press is not so inhibited and is often openly critical of     US bumbling in foreign affairs, Bubba's alleged (alledged?)     cocaine habit and criminal behaviour, --likewise critical of all
    fools.
        Where does this lead?  Well, we've probably peaked on     freedom; the rest is downhill as our "non-elected" government     degenerates to deploying more and more thought control to     maintain the oligarchic fascist form of what Jefferson thought     they were creating as a representative republic.
        I for one enjoy tweaking their nose, but it only stiffens     their resolve to squash me/us/whatever.         How do you show resolve without being in their face?       most regulation is created to "eliminate" abuse of a "public"     privilege; unfortunately, we all suffer "collateral damage"     to use their term.          does voluntary compliance work? unfortunately, no.
        where does that leave us?  confrontation, I guess.     preserve our advantage as long as we can.  we all know     from mï¿½nchen that Clement Atlee made a fool of himself     appeasing Hitler for a false peace.
        might as well carry on with what we do best:
            rape, pillage, and burn... a scorched earth policy....

    the CFR is the bastion of established wealth.
        this is a blatant statement that our government ("of and     for the people") has every intention of fully controlling the     content of * everything * we see. The five media conglomes     already toe the line in the interests of the NWO.          What the NWO failed to consider in their plans was the     explosion of the net, and * free * information --the inability     of the ruling order to control the news, and stifle mass     market criticism before it becomes a topic of general     discussion.
        Bubba's mouthpiece uttered the classic incompetent     government under attack mentality response to the problem:     "...hey, joe criminal uses sophisticated computer encryption     to plot his crimes.  why must we be subject to criminals?      let's ban all communication [we can not control]...."
        the suggestion that if commerce was permitted secure     cryptography, secure servers, and able to develop its own     safety net, the incentive would then not be worth the cost of
    the mob cracking the codes (they would be reduced back
    to the usual reliance on an inside job which, will be harder     and harder with better security)
        No, but that solution does not serve the purpose of statist     governments controlling * everything *         personally, I am even more pessimistic than that:         America is being destroyed by the actions of our leaders     and their puppet-meisters:         1.  the rewriting of educational textbooks by grant             dependent university professors.
        2.  the rewrite of history to reflect not only the             politically correct views, but to reflect history as             the elite wish to see it --even to the point of             rewriting quotations of Thomas Jefferson to suit their
            purpose.
        3.  the destruction of the means of investment by             permitting an "unregulated" economy built on the             greed of a elitist "core" of stock brokers who block             consumer actions until their own manipulations have set             the pace for their own gains.
        4.  the destruction a solvent government by the debt-based             economy of the Federal Reserve Bank which is not even
            owned by the central government.
        5.  the destruction of the educational system by reverting
            to education by the lowest common denominator. how can             young adults who graduate from high school with an             education which leaves them functionally literate             enough to take a driver's license and mathematically             skill only well enough to balance a check book be             consider "educated, well-informed" citizens?
        6.  the destruction of any work-incentive by the             establishment of a welfare society.  the message today             is that it is "socially acceptable" to accept the dole; in
            fact, it is preferable to demeaning oneself with             entry-level work.
        Is it any wonder why the U.S. has dropped below  in the     educational sweepsteaks of "Western" culture.
        The result is a population base which is Joe-Six-Pack * at     best, *  functional to the point of being able to turn on a TV     for 18 hours a day --the average viewing time of the American     public is now 7.2 hours * per day, * according to one recent
    report.          Another reports states that the average 6 year old today     has seen >2,000 murders...   is there any question why there     is no value on life?
        bubba is acting with "fear" as his motto.  Dole wants to     literately wipe out drugs, even to the point of putting a     soldier on every street corner.
        are we down to this?             1935 will go down in history!             For the first time a civilized nation has full gun
registration!             Our streets will be safer, our police more efficient, and
the             world will follow our lead in the future!                 --Adolf Hitler
      46. The U.S. government declares a ban on the possession,       sale, transportation, and transfer of all non-sporting       firearms.   ...Consider the following statement:
            I would fire upon U.S. citizens who refuse or resist             confiscation of firearms banned by the U.S. government.                 --The USMC 29 Palms Combat Arms Survey         The survey was given to virtually all special combat units     of the Marine Corps (including my son), USArmy special units,     Navy Seals, &c.  depending on which survey, there were 42     to 54 questions; the government told the men that the major     giving the "quiz" was doing a master's paper, or some such     poppycock.
        The government's intent is clear, the above is how they     intend to enforce it, and either we stop it now, or there will
    be no stopping it.  guns are a part of it since it denies the     ability of "We, the people..." to take offensive action against     the government with even reasonable _personal_ firepower     --never mind the sophistication of the government arsenal.      The only thing in the peoples' favour is that guerilla warfare     is extremely difficult to deal with.
        Why has it gone this far?  because Joe-Six-Pack will sell     all his freedom in return for the promised security.  whose is     the Judas goat?  the captive press.
        there is no need to subscribe to conspiracy theories     --there are enough facts of the table that conspiracies are     irrelevant.
        but, the statement that a "wired world will 'diminish national
    sovereignty' is absolutely true --governments might just be fully     accountable.
one of the few things we all share:   the utter, corrosive contempt for our elected officials.

= Can you give a clear example of this??
= Just asking
        the most blatant one was the rewording of Jefferson's words
    for the equality of all men about two years ago.  As we know,     Jefferson was all for freedom, and had a "God bless you, you're
    a slave" attitude, but he was clearly not for the equalization.     when that one came out of washington, several papers had a     hard time with it, but I have seen it since.
        I have been collecting Jefferson quotes for years; frankly, I
    always considered the Dems were off base: Jefferson was the     Republican --leaving Hamilton and his Federalists as pawns pawns     of the Illuminati as advocates of the independent Federal Bank     (the worst of the Rothschilds (Maurice, I think) who made the     statements regarding control of the government by control of the     money was in his prime around 1800).         I am not a dedicated Jeffersonian scholar, but he has been     the corner stone of my (now long blown) faith in our government.     I would a complete set of Jefferson's works --if, and only, if I
    could find a good edition published over a 100 years ago.
        secondly, Jefferson is now interpreted as being the great     enfranchiser, which is not even close to his view. Jefferson's     writings clearly emphasize that the electorate should be comprised
    of the landed and merchant class; secondly, it was Jefferson's     statement that the electorate, and therefore the juries should be
    composed "...of a well educated and informed citizenry."     Jefferson was interested in an electorate which was of     substance and possessing of a stake in America.
        One of the clear principles of Jeffersonian thought was that
    jury, beyond the requirement of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,
    was to _vote its conscience_.  Jefferson was responsible for     including the constitutional language which makes this possible,     even today, despite instructions from judges who could care less     about the intent of the constitution and are treating the accused     as nothing more than cattle on the way to the abattoir --if they     are not guilty this time they will be next time, so why waste     further time --sometimes known as "collateral damage." = >         Why has it gone this far?  because Joe-Six-Pack will sell  = >     all his freedom in return for the promised security.  who is    = >    the Judas goat?  the captive press.

= Actually, being a "Joe six pack" my own damn self, I'd have to say

        Agreed on the restoration of concealed weapons rights which
    had been regulated out of existence.
        Granted, Joe-Six-Pack may not be the perfect analogy, but I     refer to America's working class, blue collar and the grunts of     the white collars as Joe-Six-Pack --maybe I should say     Joe-Couch-Potato.  the class" referenced is a collection of many
    levels --what they have in common is they work and then confrom
    to the current norm of 7.2 hrs/day in front of the tube which
    their entire source of information --THEY will sell out from
        If you refer to Joe-Six-Pack as the the classic Southern red     neck, any attempt to limit their freedom, particularly the right
    a pickup truck with a gun rack, and their handguns --that's a very
    different situation. and that extends to small town westerners,     like myself, and to the plains.  I grew up on a farm, went to     Harvard, joined the spooks for six years of a bloodpath, bounced
    around the world in different fields, and I am back in a very
small     community in the high desert: 100 families.  Noone around here     questions my bad attitude --the admissions requirements are at     least 5 kids and 2000 rounds.
        However, I think Joe-Six-Pack, in this constrained social set,
    for the vast majority would sell out on freedom of cryptography.
    they do not understand it, particularly against the onslaught of     the pinko-liberal captive media.  Our job is to educate them --and
    not with defiant rhetoric (such as mine).
        As for concealed weapons permits, bank robberies should     certainly drop --all it would take is one cowboy (and I'll     volunteer) and anything other than a large coordinated operation
    is in serious trouble.  One unsuspected, mean and surly patron     with a .357 who seriously knows how and when to use same is     very effective.  On the other hand, I do not recommend carrying
    an assault rifle on a sling over your shoulder to visit the
        The simple (I think) point I was trying to make was: the vast
    majority of our U.S. citizens would acquiesce to the deployment     of federal troops in return for security, rather than being armed,
    Posse Comitas not withstanding, to wipe crime off the streets.      The point could even be made: the troops might as well be doing     something useful rather than sitting around their bases; we do     have a rather large standing army --unfortunately, they would     become poorly trained and poorly disciplined --and could easily
    be part of the massive corruption in our cities (and every other
    government over many people).  Frankly, we should all vote in     a _free_ cyberspace;  forget the current system of choosing
    party loyalists and presidential electors.
        The application of a military mentality on the streets is not     my idea of law and order --they could kill off the majority of     the crime by legalizing all drugs and dispensing them in clinics.
    Britain reduced their second story (burglary) crime rate by over     60%; they did find they had a great many more addicts than the     thought, however.  A second benefit is that it takes some of the     mystery and challenge out of drugs --however, be prepared for the
    alcohol problem, although that effect would be significantly less
    than the current social cost of having 10% of the male black     population in lockdown.
        no, my bottome line is the Bubba has sunk to bottom with     paranoia, both he and the elite money interests which jerk all of
    the politicial habituites who depend on their soft money for their
    campaings and who wish to participate at the trough of influence     and greed (ever see someone retired after many years in Washington
    without a bundle).

before everyone else flames tim, I'll toss a couple-three
    Carter dollars in the pot:
        1.  where has compassion, which is wrung from an unwilling             minority by coercian, ever succeeded in building the             economy in *real* numbers without raising taxes             disproportionately for more bureaucratic waste?
            forget the idea that it will build a community --unless             you wish to consider the Bitch's "It Takes a Global             Village" a community.  Statist from the cradle; welcome
            to "Logan's Run."
        2.  if there is community "welfare" by the biblical definition,
            is it:
            a) socialism, and             b) does it cost the community additional taxes?              NO, it does not need to be or do either, BUT, it means
            that everybody independently attempts to succeed and the
            'community' takes care of itself --and in the standard             sense, the ne'er do wells fall off the path of *their own             free choice.*  There will always be sickness and calamity,
            but that is what the community is for.
            BTW, it still works today; I live in one of 'em.
        3.  deciding on a personal level where to draw the line is not
            necessarily socialy irresponsible. we will always have             Scrooge, and God-forbid we should lose a few bleeding-
            heart-with-your-money liberals for the final chestnut roast.
            Now, I don't intend to be Scrooge, but I'll fight for my
            rights to cut off at the knees the knee-jerk liberals and             government slavemeisters who want to tell me that I, and             2 others are required to support 100 freeloaders.              --a .357 mag shell can still be loaded for less than a             dime.

    charitable, and this fact gave FDR the opportunity to start the
    interminable dole, generation after generation of welfare
    _entitlements_.          the lazy, the pregnant teenagers on their third child, &c.
    believe they are _entitled_ to pick my pocket, and your pocket.
        at this point < 20% of the population is supporting > 80%
    who are _entitled_ to my support because some bleeding heart
    knee jerk says so.  the federal budget defines these programs as     _entitlements_ --they have even dropped the pretense of calling     it "aid" or "welfare."  It is a separate budget class by itself

    who cannibalize their fallen comrads.

London Daily Telegraph for 25 Sep 95
Thatcher hits out at moral 'corrosion' [Anonymized]
LADY Thatcher spoke out against the "licentiousness" of the permissive
society last night and said that children were being brought up in a
morally corrosive atmosphere.
The former Prime Minister expressed her distaste for the coarsening of
popular culture in a lecture in London which praised the enduring
values and institutions of American civilisation.  On the day in which
the annual crime figures showed the first overall increase in Britain
for several years, she also lamented the steady decline in law and
order which had rendered everyone "less secure than we of a right
should be".
She said:  "From the most heinous acts of terrorism to the petty
burglar and street corner mugger, we are confronted by those for whom
words such as 'justice' and 'right' have no meaning.  We see around
ourselves the licentiousness of modern society manifested in popular
culture.  We have witnessed a coarsening of everything from art to
music to literature and film.  But for some people there seems to be
nothing beyond the pale, for them freedom has no limits."
Lady Thatcher did not specify the targets of her criticism, but went
on to accuse those who advocated unrestrained freedom of expression as
perverse, demeaning and dangerous.  She said:  "The younger generation
is being reared in a morally corrosive atmosphere where they are
taught that in the name of liberty, anything goes.  There is no
elevation of the human spirit in works designed merely to shock or to
appeal only to our most base instincts."
Lady Thatcher's vigorous defence of the rule of law reprised a
familiar theme from her period of office in Downing Street, when the
Conservatives were themselves accused of fuelling the rise in
lawlessness by putting too great an emphasis on individualism.
However she did not refer to the present Government and its internal
difficulties at all, except to warn in passing of what she saw as the
dangers posed by the Labour Party or bureaucrats in Brussels.  She
said:  "If we should be enticed once more down the rutted and muddy
road of socialism, we will again find Britain mired in a morass of
stifling regulations and government controls."
In a sustained attack on state-enforced egalitarianism, Lady Thatcher
also hit out at the fashion for political correctness as "the guiding
sentiment of tyrants in every age" who believed that if they
controlled what people read, they controlled the people themselves.
Delivering the inaugural James Bryce lecture for London University's
Institute of United States Studies, Lady Thatcher called for more
serious study of the history and culture of America to understand the
exceptional role the US had played in world affairs.  It had served as
a beacon of enlightenment in the struggles against German imperialism,
fascist aggression and communist tyranny during this century, and
would dominate the next.
She said:  "We are confronted by a stream of dictators and tyrants who
will seek to dominate those nations around them, if not the entire
world.  The deepest conflicts between men will not subside, nor can
they subside until the basic principles of individual liberty and
political freedom are embraced throughout the world."
Lady Thatcher said that too much talk of "rights" was in danger of
overwhelming the importance of duty and responsibility in a free
country.  She said:  "In the process, liberty decays into licence in
an atmosphere where all is permitted and nothing prohibited.  The
resulting permissive society is in fact no society at all.  It is
little more than a state of nature where the line between right and
wrong is first blurred and then obliterated - a place where no one
dares to say no.  There can be no order without authority, and
authority that is impotent or hesitant in the face of intimidation,
crime and violence, cannot endure."
She challenged the modern assumption that progress was the general
rule and corruption the exception.  Often, it was the other way
around.  "Freedom and civilisation are conditions that require great
effort, deep thought, and unwavering commitment," she said.

    there are other indications.
        BU claims association with a given location of which I am     _very_  familiar. the crest belongs to a specific lineage, of
    which I have a direct connection to about 300 years ago.         BU has a past "life," I have a past "life," and the two are
    related --but you will not "hear" the "truth," calling it     "fiction," anyway.
        BU is a lawyer.  and he has done a _great_ deal more with his
    degree than I, who refused to practice in the U.S. Is BU currently
    a practicing lawyer? does it matter?
        BU is extremely well researched, and current. I suspect BU
    deals primarily with accounting, funding, and assets management,
    the details of which are irrelevant.  If I needed a solid opinion,
    backed by existing law cites, and conflicting decisions, I would     trust BU --and, I am plenty fiesty,   need I say more?
        I do not have a "need to know" BU's "real name" any more

        the research and the smell of blood (if channeled to real
    justice) is immensely satisfying --it is the members of the
    American club, and the intendent body trading which turns my
    stomach --that, and 'kill' based compensation.
        the difference in civil v. common law origined justice is not
    the code...
        to put it another way: in criminal procedings: I would rather
    be considered guilty, until proven innocent; than I would be
    presumed innocent, until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
        a nation whch can base a conviction on conspiracy to commit a
    crime, or permits circumstantial evidence to close the gap towards
    'beyond a reasonable doubt,'  has lost any pretense of understand-
    ing the heritage of common law: the Magna Carta.
  Of course the US Constitution isn't perfect;
    but it's a whole lot better than what we have now.

     There is a solution. Trade Schools,
        This is the single most important fact in the U.S. inability
    maintain the manufacturing  prowess we enjoyed until some poorly
    defined point in time after WWII!
        1.  several waves of immigration, most notably Germany after
            WWI, brought thousands of skilled machinists, &c. many
            of whom went the trade school route by screening or by
            socio-economic factors.
        2.  the U.S. prior to 1920 had an excellent trade school and
            apprentice program.
        WWII was the breaking point. the younger generation who
    survived the war wanted more for their children --hence the
    college emphasis for _everyone_!
        The problem was simple:  we have only the now retiring
    toolmakers who make it all possible.  engineering graduates will
    not observe the manufacturing floors since it is above their
    dignity to roll of their sleeves.
        if engineers were required to serve internships in the shops,
    as doctors are required to intern in a hospital (and the really
    good ones, the top of the class, choose what I call meat-wagon
    wards (large city ER and trauma units), the U.S. would be a far
    healthier and competitive environment.
        I know, why the meat wagon wards with their pressure and
    unreasonable hours?    experience, anything and everything
    comes through those doors every night, and it goes off the scale
    on the weekends...
        is there any reason to send an illiterate to college other
    to socialize?  is there any reason why the school system
    can only see a college degree other than for those who they
    prejudged to be just another generation of welfare mothers
    and deadbeat dads?
        why do many with 4 year college degrees only work as entry
    level secretaries, Burger King night "managers."  &c? then what
    do the rest of them do?  join the cradle to the grave dole gener-
    ation!
and Parental Envolvement.
It could  very well be (and if I had the money I'd make the bet)
that _many_ of the  "troubled" youth of today are simply
        more the problem that the parents become interested too late,
    after the child has seen 2,000 murders on TV before the age of 6;
    walked the streets of parentless daytime; started cocaine at 16,
    maybe even 10; running for a gang....
        then they wail at the funeral: "...it's not fair, johnny was
    such a good boy...  society never gave him a chance...."   what
    they mean is they collect a $100/mo or so less from welfare!
        I have raised(ing) 5 children  --no TV in the house, and G
    rated movies occasionally.  what did/do the children find to
    do?  read, read, and read.  I don't have a problem trying to pry
    children away from a TV --but I often hear: "...puh-leez, daddy,
    just let me finish this chapter."   No such luck....
(Fortunately, most of  them couldn't afford to bet
against their parents in an AP world).
        real true...
It would also seem to
follow that if parents were spending their own money (or
perceived it as their own money) that they would take a greater
interest in their childrens education.
        ...if they were smart enough to start about age 3.  the
    problem is further excaberated by the fact the average family
    expects the state to provide the "enthusiasum"  --is there any
    reason then, to expect other than Hillary's "It's a global
    with her brand of liberal brainwashing of the next generation
    (all new revisionist history, etc.).   Welcome to "Logan's Run!"
        fortunately, I have no problem with the public schools. I'm
    not the only one in the neighborhood without a TV, and the
    community has trade schools mixed with the high schools,
    and a two year college to supplement the advanced placement
    programs.  very few families have two parents working.  the kids
    can play outside after dark, and our young women can walk by
    themselves after dark.  (I do admit that one good scream would
    have an extremely well-armed about to be posse out the door in
    15 seconds...  --I doubt there would be prisoners!)
        a very unusual situation  --but I live in rural southern utah
    where the regional middle school of 1200 can support 4 bands, the
    top 2 being very impressive, and provide full AP classes, and ACT
    scores averaging 24-26+ v. the national average of 20 for inbound
    freshman. and, where an average ward (100-150 families) will have
    at least a dozen Eagle scouts.
        proves your point, I guess...

Wow! Utah is teaching AP?  Is Jim Bell being brought in as a
Special Lecturer?
        come on, Tim... you are not that old.  AP has three meanings
    (at least):
        1.  Associated Press (news gathering)
        2.  Advanced Placement (as in college credit for HS classes)
        3.  not widely known:  Jim Bell's Assassination Political
        I wonder if Jim Bell would enjoy his stay in Utah's Dixie?
    there is only one bar in Washington county, and I understand
    it's pretty limited (if you even find it!).
(I knew Idaho has special Militia classes, but to hear that Utah is
now teaching Assassination Politics is pretty impressive.)
        Utah does not need militia classes:
        1.  opening of deer season (Oct 20) is a state holiday.
            thing shuts down: schools, business, government... we take
            it real serious....
        2.  according to info I scanned from one of those moving
            target bleeding heart liberals, utahns have more weapons
            than children, and you know we have a lot of children.
        3.  if you are aware of Mormon heritage: despite a trail of
            blood from Kirtland (mild), Missouri (3 times, severe),
            and Nauvoo (medium), only one incident (in Missouri)
            found Mormons fighting to defend themselves.  In Utah,
            we endured an occupying U.S. army for almost 50 years
            while statehood was denied...  and our leaders were
            imprisoned, property and assets confiscated, etc.
        that's OK, tim;  I'm glad you're still feeling your oats in
    your old age!
one of the few things we all share:
  the utter, corrosive contempt for our elected officials.

     In my neighborhood, screams are so common (mostly from kids playing,
and yes, I do check as often as I can) that most people don't bother to
        a scream of terror is a different scream.  besides, we have 6
    families in our 8-10 acre section --33 kids between us.  and our
    air raid siren would be howling like an inbound kamikaze.
Very different worlds. My wife and I are probably the only ones who
_don't_ watch TV. We have 2, plus 5 computers, and 5 or 6 book shelves. The
TV's were free, so were 2 of the computers.
        we're light on computers at the moment --only 3, and I need 3
    more.    bookshelves?  30 feet, floor to ceiling, packed. trying
    save enough to get one of the 7 CD rom up in parallel deals for
    the 8G freeBSD fileserver --OS/2 (merlin) workstations. stuff is
    expensive, even when you buy right.
        well, out here, probably 20% of the families did not have a
    TV;  I gave the "message" one Sunday a couple months ago and
    the percentage has gone up.  those who did have TVs have them
    severely restricted for content --there are no R movies
    tolerated --and most do not bring in a commercial signal --VCRs.
        the population base is changing with an influx of non-Mormons
    in town, so R rated are showing up at the theatres and video
    rentals in town.
        the police visible prescence is effective --a force of 50+ for

    can be a real task with internecine warfare and all that good
    stuff.   It starts at home and goes the route.  there is no dead
    time on a streetcorner, or at friends house without a parent home.

        the example I have always used:

        gets stinking drunk and passes out on the floor.  the other
        two go across the street to be arrested for the attempted
        heist.
            the police arrest the drunk on the floor. why?
            "conspiracy to commit the crime!"  and the penalty is the
        same: 7-20 years in the federal slam.
            --unless you are socially disadvantaged and claim heroin
        addiction; then you make it to the street in as little as 18
        months and wipe the tail within 7 years, not 20.  the rule was
        the offender must be less than 25, it may have been raised.

If you deny one form of speech, it is easy to deny     another, and then another...  do you wish to march foolishly to     Fahrenheit 451?
    Before the current generation of government vipers and revisionists     remove or rewrite even more of the immortal words of history:
        "Those who deny freedom to others           deserve it not for themselves."
                --Abraham Lincoln
    let's look at one more famous speech on "nibbling" your rights:         "Let us contemplate our forefathers, and posterity, and resolve         to maintain the rights bequeathed to us from the former, for         the sake of the latter.          "Let us remember that 'if we suffer tamely a lawless attack         upon our liberty, we encourage it, and involve others in our         doom.'  It is a very serious consideration that millions yet         unborn may be the miserable sharers of the event."
            --Samuel Adams ("patriot, statesman..."), speech, 1771
    and:
        "The more difficult it is to interact with the government,         the more the government wants gun control."
            --attila
    in other words, the more they deny our inaliable right to free     speech, the more they need gun control before we rise against the
    usurpers of our rights.
    Now, if there ever was a liberal do-gooder, Eleanor certainly was:
        "No one can make you feel inferior without your consent."             --Eleanor Roosevelt
    now, does she mean what she says literally?  in other words, is
    she saying to say what you want, and she will not be harmed or     "feel inferior" in this case?  I can presume Eleanor could be
    offended, but is that sufficient to abridge your rights?
    Nietzsche expresses a defiant tone on first glance -no, the general     interpretation is absolute freedom --speech included.
        "I understand by 'freedom of Spirit' something quite definite -
            the unconditional will to say No,             where it is dangerous to say No."
                --Friedrich Nietzsche
    Is not the right to bear arms the same basic freedom as free     speech, with one limitation: improper use carries criminal     penalties --basically, because the act denies another his freedom.
        "The right of self-defense is the first law of nature         ...and when the right of the people to keep and bear arms         is, under any color or pretext whatsoever, prohibited,         liberty, if not already annihilated,         is on the brink of destruction."
            --St. George Tucker,                 in his edition of Blackstone's Commentaries
    did not the Magna Carta guarantee the right of free speech?  Of     course, there was not full suffrage at that time, but the Magna
    Carta is the basis of our common law.
    Then, let's look at another concept of freedom and a "democracy"         Just because a mob calls itself a government, doesn't make it               so.
        Democracy is two wolves and a sheep voting on what to have for           dinner.
        People who claim that money doesn't matter, are usually living           on someone else's money.
        Society is a mental construct, formed by those people who are           too insecure to handle the concept of people as individuals.
    which gets down to just what the hell did my forefathers, and maybe     yours, fight for in 1776 if it was not for freedom of speech and     assembly, the right to bear arms, to be free from unreasonable     search and seizure; and enjoy the protection of law?     if we do not pick up that fight and stop corrupt governments from     usurping the power of the people, we will lose all freedom. If we     give in on _any_ of the first 10 amendments, our Bill of Rights, we     are surrendering our deserved personal franchise to a usurping     government.  and it starts with society and government trying to     tell us what we can freely say.     I may not like what you have to say, or that you insult my     sensibilities or my rectitude, but I will defend your right to my     death so that you may do so.
    Therefore:
        "With heart and hand I pledge you while I load my gun again,         you will never be forgotten or the enemy forgiven,         my good comrade..."

    Before the current generation of government vipers and revisionists     remove or rewrite even more of the immortal words of history:
        "Those who deny freedom to others           deserve it not for themselves."
                --Abraham Lincoln
    let's look at one more famous speech on "nibbling" your rights:         "Let us contemplate our forefathers, and posterity, and resolve         to maintain the rights bequeathed to us from the former, for         the sake of the latter.          "Let us remember that 'if we suffer tamely a lawless attack         upon our liberty, we encourage it, and involve others in our         doom.'  It is a very serious consideration that millions yet         unborn may be the miserable sharers of the event."
            --Samuel Adams ("patriot, statesman..."), speech, 1771
    and:
        "The more difficult it is to interact with the government,         the more the government wants gun control."
            --attila
    in other words, the more they deny our inaliable right to free     speech, the more they need gun control before we rise against the
    usurpers of our rights.
    Now, if there ever was a liberal do-gooder, Eleanor certainly was:
        "No one can make you feel inferior without your consent."             --Eleanor Roosevelt
    now, does she mean what she says literally?  in other words, is
    she saying to say what you want, and she will not be harmed or     "feel inferior" in this case?  I can presume Eleanor could be
    offended, but is that sufficient to abridge your rights?
    Nietzsche expresses a defiant tone on first glance -no, the general     interpretation is absolute freedom --speech included.
        "I understand by 'freedom of Spirit' something quite definite -
            the unconditional will to say No,             where it is dangerous to say No."
                --Friedrich Nietzsche
    Is not the right to bear arms the same basic freedom as free     speech, with one limitation: improper use carries criminal     penalties --basically, because the act denies another his freedom.
        "The right of self-defense is the first law of nature         ...and when the right of the people to keep and bear arms         is, under any color or pretext whatsoever, prohibited,         liberty, if not already annihilated,         is on the brink of destruction."
            --St. George Tucker,                 in his edition of Blackstone's Commentaries
    did not the Magna Carta guarantee the right of free speech?  Of     course, there was not full suffrage at that time, but the Magna
    Carta is the basis of our common law.
    Then, let's look at another concept of freedom and a "democracy"         Just because a mob calls itself a government, doesn't make it               so.
        Democracy is two wolves and a sheep voting on what to have for           dinner.
        People who claim that money doesn't matter, are usually living           on someone else's money.
        Society is a mental construct, formed by those people who are           too insecure to handle the concept of people as individuals.
    which gets down to just what the hell did my forefathers, and maybe     yours, fight for in 1776 if it was not for freedom of speech and     assembly, the right to bear arms, to be free from unreasonable     search and seizure; and enjoy the protection of law?     if we do not pick up that fight and stop corrupt governments from     usurping the power of the people, we will lose all freedom. If we     give in on _any_ of the first 10 amendments, our Bill of Rights, we     are surrendering our deserved personal franchise to a usurping     government.  and it starts with society and government trying to     tell us what we can freely say.     I may not like what you have to say, or that you insult my     sensibilities or my rectitude, but I will defend your right to my     death so that you may do so.
    Therefore:
        "With heart and hand I pledge you while I load my gun again,         you will never be forgotten or the enemy forgiven,         my good comrade..."

Virtually all list postings to the cypherpunks main list are     doubled; the first, which is a standard pass through with the     message ID of the sender, the second with the message ID of     toad.com.
    Obviously, the first is destined for the unedited list --which did     _not_ receive the message. The second has been re-IDd, which I     presume is your censorhip mark.
    I happen to subscribe to all three lists, even though
        main + flames == unedited
    is supposedly the intention, it is not. In order to divide the
    output stream from toad.com, sorting on "Sender: " is the only
    reasonable differentation (when toad's filters are working):
        Sender: owner-cypherpunks at toad.com
        Sender: owner-cypherpunks-flames at toad.com
        Sender: owner-cypherpunks-unedited at toad.com
        Sender: owner-coderpunks at toad.com
    in the case cited below, the only differentation between the     destinations is that the censored message has a "Message-ID: "
    from toad.com, while the one intended for unedited has a     "Message-ID: " not from toad.com.  was either of these     destinated from flames? --the main list with duplicated messages
    has contained any number of messages, including ones from the
    ASCII art series which should have gone to flames.
    so, why is the pass through message not being reliably re-headered     at toad.com to mark "Sender: owner-cypherpunks-unedited at toad.com"
    --but if it is, why is unedited receiving a duplicate --obviously
    the duplicate should have gone to flames.     BOTTOM LINE: your software is inadequate.  my neighbors' kids write     better filters than you have installed.

the "message" example which follows is obviously a message which     should have been destinated for owner-cypherpunks-flame.  there is     absolutely no indication of the differentation and the header shows:

    let's put it this way, if cp is to be censored, might as well do the     job correctly as this message was dumped into the main list.      regardless, censoring what is supposed to be the free speech     defenders of the online world is a poor example of our toleration     for differing viewpoints, regardless of their alledged stupidity or     off-topic value, or lack of value.  So far, cypherpunks is showing     less tolerance for freedom of speech that the United State Supreme     Court.

    if you receive both the unedited and the censored plus flames, each     message should be doubled --unedited sends all messages, but fails     to always mark them in sender -basically, you need to key on the     fact the Message-ID is NOT .... at toad.com for the unedited file
    no, I dont have a problem with that, it is just stupid on toad's     part (John?) to not correctly identify the pass through messages     with 'Sender: owner-cypherpunks-unedited at toad.com'  --a few are,     but the vast majority are still shipped out as 'Sender:     owner-cypherpunks at toad.com' (and the 'Received' chain as I pointed     out in my original post). to me that is piss poor list management.
    unfortunately, I can not use procmail at this point on my mail     reader platform, but the internal filters are multilevel and do     allow enough flexibility. I use procmail extensively on my host for     autobots, spam filtering, objectional posters filtering, etc.     I think you  probably have an error in your procmail script as to     sending 'unedited' to flames. the theory stated is:
        mainline (censored) + flames == unedited
    but I will not test it since I prefer to read/respond off line with     MR/2 than Pine online. I will request Nick Knight for the     construction of his folders (except he has no lock mechanism) and I     might write a PPP POP3 mail recovery program, pass it through     procmail which passes it to a function to write it to MR/2's     folders.
        however you slice it, censorship on a freedom of speech list         just does not make it and we make fools of ourselves if we think     otherwise.

    if you receive both the unedited and the censored plus flames, each     message should be doubled --unedited sends all messages, but fails     to always mark them in sender -basically, you need to key on the     fact the Message-ID is NOT .... at toad.com for the unedited file
    no, I dont have a problem with that, it is just stupid on toad's     part (John?) to not correctly identify the pass through messages     with 'Sender: owner-cypherpunks-unedited at toad.com'  --a few are,     but the vast majority are still shipped out as 'Sender:     owner-cypherpunks at toad.com' (and the 'Received' chain as I pointed     out in my original post). to me that is piss poor list management.
    unfortunately, I can not use procmail at this point on my mail     reader platform, but the internal filters are multilevel and do     allow enough flexibility. I use procmail extensively on my host for     autobots, spam filtering, objectional posters filtering, etc.     I think you  probably have an error in your procmail script as to     sending 'unedited' to flames. the theory stated is:
        mainline (censored) + flames == unedited
    but I will not test it since I prefer to read/respond off line with     MR/2 than Pine online. I will request Nick Knight for the     construction of his folders (except he has no lock mechanism) and I     might write a PPP POP3 mail recovery program, pass it through     procmail which passes it to a function to write it to MR/2's     folders.
        however you slice it, censorship on a freedom of speech list         just does not make it and we make fools of ourselves if we think     otherwise.

@_subject: censorship and headers 
the "message" example which follows is obviously a message which     should have been destinated for owner-cypherpunks-flame.  there is     absolutely no indication of the differentation and the header shows:
        Sender: owner-cypherpunks at toad.com
    when it should have shown:
        Sender: owner-cypherpunks-edited at toad.com
    let's put it this way, if cp is to be censored, might as well do the     job correctly as this message was dumped into the main list.      regardless, censoring what is supposed to be the free speech     defenders of the online world is a poor example of our toleration     for differing viewpoints, regardless of their alledged stupidity or     off-topic value, or lack of value.  So far, cypherpunks is showing     less tolerance for freedom of speech that the United State Supreme     Court. You all know something I dont?  or do I need to start     cleaning and oiling real soon?

    for instance, I have been debating whether or not we can afford the     load on our single T1 which is currently supporting 200 simultaneous     ppp connections plus some high-volume commerical web pages. We are     at least a year away from T3 due to lack of circuit facilities.
    let's figure a way to stop at least some of the abuse; you can not     stop the individual abuse, but does a spammer have any rights?

tim:      two points you make:     1.  the propogation is slow...
    2.  some sites do not carry alt. groups
    are enough to kill an active discussion list. of course, it does
    slow down excessive volume.
    I vote we just set up a new majordomo with some additional antispam     filters including knocking out exploding mail headers, etc. I would     accept excluding non-members as long as we take the remailers which     are listed with either JP or RL.
    Therefore, I am willing to host it on our majordomo which I have     pretty well shaken down for other lists.  other than spam and     potentially non-members, I refuse to even consider censorship or     moderation in any form.      Likewise, Jim Choate and Sten Drescher apparently are trying to     establish a multi-site majordomo.  the extra work of maintaining     non-duplicates and sychronization makes the task non-trivial and     questionable...
    as for failure mode recovery, I can always run a backup from     primenet; I dont really see the need for it; we have had less than     4 hours downtime in the last year, and that for a regional power     failure which will be a mute point sometime this spring when the     diesal generators arrive.  knock on wood, but the T1 has been up     straight through.

    I could not agree more, in theory, except for the postage you     discuss below which permits spammers greed to exceed responsibility,     let alone the public interest.
    I am, of course, a theoretical anarchist; I believe I could put     aside greed (and have) to be sufficiently altruistic to make a     society of anarchists work (in a limited population model).     However:
        "Only two things are infinite,           the universe and human stupidity,           and I'm not sure about the former."
                --Albert Einstein
    as long as we have a >30% third and fourth generation welfare class     which the dogood liberal bleeders say we are obligated to sustain     their breeding; and another 30% which are functionally illiterate,     there is no hope for idealism.
    our "neighbors" have no idea how to spell anarchy, let alone     understand the price of freedom.
    just because I would cut off the permanent welfare class at the     knees, and disenfranchise the functionally illiterate if I had the     chance, does not make anarchy any more feasible; it's just a more     rigid police state for the havenots --again, something we do not     need.
    sorry to be a pragmatic pessimist, but it went down hill with the     16th amendment and the Federal Reserve Act to benefit the         Rockefellers, Vanderbilts, Rothschilds, Chases, etc. at our expense. +Having the court system involved in deciding what mail is valid and
+what is not valid is not my idea of a free society.
    again, you are correct except anarchy requires responsibility. free     agency has its requirements and this is why junk fax was banned.
    too many members of our society can not spell anarchy or     responsibility --their knowledge of vocabulary starts and ends with     greed.
+Having said this, the flaw remains that "junk mail" is "free" to the

    I don't like the regulatory agencies either, but at least they are     not Judge Roy Bean, Law West of the Pecos.

    toad.com was never set up to show cypherpunks at road.com in the     "Reply-To: " field, but it should have been.
    mailing lists then have the "From: " field from the original sender,

Koon was an officer's officer (personal experience) and was in the     wrong place at the wrong time, not willing to step in.

    and the video played for evidence missed the first 90 seconds when a     very large animal (Rodney King can be described no other way) came     out of the car, dancing the jig, and went after Powell.  by the time     the prosecutors, particularly the Feds, were through itimidating the     witnesses, nobody told the truth.     Rodney King had been busted for public intoxication, controlled     substances, and disorder enough times that he was well recognized     for what he was  --and easily identified.
    in the spooks, we called Powell's actions "the red mask" --once you     start staring the beast in the eye, you are so wired on there is no     stopping until your opponent is jello. 'shocktroops' or     'Stossentruppen' should never be used in civilian police forces,     except possibily on SWAT teams, not an average street cop.
    and why did we have the trial in the first place? simply because the     LA Times and KABC decided there was going to be a trial.  I dont     know whether to chalk it off to their bleeding heart liberals, or     just the usual greed for money to be made on high profile news.
    or is it just more of the usual politically correct beat down of
    the oppressive whiteface?
    it is sometimes difficult to defend the LA Police department when     you knew Daryll Gates and his predecessor, "Big Ed" Davis. Both of
    them are cowboys; Big Ed is now a state senator from the far west     Valley, what was horse country when I lived there.  they had a job     to do, and LA is a mean place. the city itself is 2/3 poverty, half     of that extreme ghetto and barrio problems.
    Big Ed is the man who proposed the fitting ending to airline     hijackings, and set up his display in plain sight: in front of
    the American Airlines terminal building 4 at LAX before LAX was     double decked.      Big Ed parked a 40 ft flat bed trailer out there with a judge's     bench at one end and a gallows at the other end with the jury box     and dock in between.  yes, sir, justice by the hijackers' peers;     take the next 12 citizens coming out the doors.
    perfect and swift justice on someone who has no defense for his     actions.
    everything else falls under this short take by a prominent author     discussing the problem with jury selection:         "The men who murdered Virginia's [Nevada] original twenty-six
    cemetary occupants were never punished.  Why?  Because Alfred the     Great, when he invented trial by jury, and knew that he had     admirably framed it to secure justice in his age of the world, was     not aware that in the nineteenth century the condition of things     would be so entirely changed that unless he rose from the grave and
    altered the jury plan to meet the emergency, it would prove the most
    ingenious and infallible agency for defeating justice that
    human wisdom could contrive.  For how could he imagine that we
    simpletons would go on using his jury plan after circumstances had
    stripped it of its usefulness, any more than he could imagine that
    we would go not using his candle clock after we had invented
    chronometers?  In his day news could not travel fast, and hence he
    could easily find a jury of honest, intelligent men who had not
    heard of the case they were called to try - but in our day of
    telegraph and newspapers his plan compels us to swear in juries
    composed of fools and rascals, because the system rigidly excludes
    honest men and men of brains.
    "I remember one of those sorrowful farces, in Virginia, which we     call a jury trial.  A noted desperado killed Mr. B, a good citizen,     in the most wanton and cold-blooded way.  Of course the papers were     full of it, and all men capable of reading read about it.  And of     course all men not deaf and dumb and idiotic talked about it.  A jury
    list was made out, and Mr.  B. L., a prominent banker and a valued
    citizen, was questioned precisely as he would have been questioned
    in any court in America:
        "`Have you heard of this homicide?'
        "`Yes.'
        "`Have you held conversations on the subject?'
        "`Yes.'
        "`Have you formed or expressed opinions about it?'
        "`Yes.'
        "`Have you read newspaper accounts of it?'
        "`Yes.'
        "`We do not want you.'
        "A minister, intelligent, esteemed, and greatly respected; a     merchant of high character and known probity; a mining     superintendent of intelligence and unblemished reputation; a     quartz-mill owner of excellent standing, were all questioned in     the same way, and all set aside.  Each said the public talk and the
    newspaper reports had not so biased his mind but that sworn
    testimony would overthrow his previously formed opinions and enable
    him to render a verdict without prejudice and in accordance with
    the facts.  But of course such men could not be trusted with the
    case.  Ignoramuses alone could mete out unsullied justice.
        "When the peremptory challenges were all exhausted, a jury of     twelve men was empaneled - a jury who swore they had neither heard,
    read, talked about, nor expressed an opinion concerning a murder
    which the very cattle in the corrals, the Indians in the sagebrush,
    and the stones in the streets were cognizant of!  It was a jury
    composed of two desperadoes, two low beerhouse politicians, three
    barkeepers, two ranchers who could not read, and three dull, stupid,
    human donkeys!  It actually came out afterward that one of these
    latter thought that incest and arson were the same thing.  "The
    verdict rendered by this jury was, Not Guilty.  What else could one
    expect?  "The jury system puts a ban upon intelligence and honesty,
    and a premium upon ignorance, stupidity, and perjury.  It is a shame
    that we must continue to use a worthless system because it was good
    a thousand years ago.          In this age, when a gentleman of high social standing,
    intelligence, and probity swears that the testimony given under
    solemn oath will outweigh, with him, street talk and newspaper
    reports based on mere hearsay, he is worth a hundred jurymen who
    will swear to their own ignorance and stupidity, and justice would
    be far safer in his hands than theirs.  Why could not the jury law
    be so altered as to give men of brains and honesty an equal chance
    with fools and miscreants?  Is it right to show the present
    favoritism to one class of men and inflict a disability on another,
    in a land whose boast is that all its citizens are free and equal?
        I am a candidate for the legislature.  I desire to tamper with     the jury law.  I wish to so alter it as to put a premium on
    intelligence and character, and close the jury box against idiots,
    blacklegs, and people who do not read newspapers.  But no doubt I
    shall be defeated - every effort I make to save the country `misses
    fire.'"

greed and the internet
        our network provider (MCI) has been gradually burying our T1     trunk and the effective feed has been reduced to 1200 baud from     1.56 Megabaud; that, and add 20 seconds to 5+ minutes of packet     hold, and it is now worthless. they claim they will have increased
    capacity, but there are no pressing big money commercial interests
    on this feeder --so when?          Problem is not just here --everywhere; the greedy commercial     bastards have oversold their network space intentionally as they     are bucking for per packet and timed usage charges which are     currently prohibited by the FCC and the state PUCs. The FCC is the     key since other than the local network, which is burdened with the     costs of the trunk, everything is regulated by the FCC which is     trying to totally eliminate the state PUCs in the 105th Congress,         Newt's mouth not withstanding.
        The FCC agreed to review the matter, capitulating to     big greed interests, which will make the Internet a rich man's     toy. $19.95/month plus access charges will increase to thousands     of dollars per month; slow networks make toast of the free hours     and overtime kills.  Without the creative input of the multitude,     there will be no content, so why have a net other than for     commercial purposes? suites the misinformation cabal just fine.
    come up again, and again, until it passes.
        The Internet will no no longer be the peoples net, and the     commercial greedies are establishing a faster, more secure     network with controlled access points; leaving the common man's     access in the mud, still paying the exorbitant rates on a pay     before play basis.  That, and it gives control of information to     the government --which, as we all know. is 'heavenly white'     -above sin.
        Universities are being bought off with the 'Internet II'     proposal which provides super trunks of over 600 Megabaud     capacity, a 400 times improvement. All of this feeds into five     stategically placed super-hubs where Uncle's shadow government can     monitor everything.
        The Internet was supposed to be our freedom: freedom of     information and government in the sunshine, but government is     proving it is still bigger, faster, and badder by using draconian     rules of illegal regulatory agencies. agencies which are usurping     rights limited to the legislative branch.

@_subject: justice for cryptography, US style 
Looks to me like Carl needs to understand justice, U.S. federal     court style. In the first place: "ignorance is no excuse under the     law" -then: ask yourself why the U.S. continues the drug war when     it is obvious to the perverted, ignorant, and bought-off Congress-     person that it will never be won. the answer is simple: it's MONEY.         First, the government makes a fortune by importing drugs, which     they can use for unaccountable programs which are illegal under     law. The money is controlled by the CIA, administration, and the     power brokers in the deal which basically states it all; and,     secondly, there is money in imprisonment. Oh? so then ask yourself     why the federal prisons have tripled in size the last 10 years with     the dope wars.  coincidental?
        now, what does that have to do with crypto?  very simple: as     the US heads closer and closer to the UN Constitution under Bubba's     guidance with Hillary's hands on his balls, crypto can bypass     political thought control.  That will not be acceptable to those     who rule: in the US, or anywhere else.
        "Intimidation is just another form of communication."  (attila)
    and they have intimidated federal judges, and they are intimidating     federal judges, and they will continue to intimdate federal judges.     and, they will continue to feed the media what they want known.
        so, what does that have to do with it?
        a)  the federal government is disenfranchising felons with
            certain types of convictions, including drugs, and all
            offenses against the federal government --cryptography
            is an offense against the federal government since it
            falls under ITAR.
            do you know what disenfranchisement really means: well,
            start with fact you have lost your civil rights --ALL of             them. the man never needs a warrant to take you, anywhere.             anyplace, including your home without knocking --he has             automatic probable cause.
            all federal convictions of the type described carry a tail             --extended probation. in other words, a sadistic, sadonic,             and automatically suspicious federal civil servant OWNS             you. He can visit your employer; he can tell you exactly             how to run your business if you are self-employed; he can             tell you if you can move; he can tell you who you will see             or talk with; and if tells you to polish his apple, get on             your knees and smile while you labour.         b)  no vote --that is the principle meaning of franchise which             is defined as "suffrage."  you are history on that score             unless you manage to convince Bubba to grant you a federal             pardon.
        c)  the federal govenment, through one of their federal money             giveaways is forcing the criminal records onto the drivers'             license.  So far, no state has a check box on the sealed             photo ID, but they will, including a coded offense block.
        d)  now, the big credit bureaus, TRW, Equifax, etc. have added             the collection of data for traffic convictions; so far they             have not added either misdemeanor and felony >>arrests<<             and convictions to the _available_ information, but they             will.  Did you know that you can have a 3 or 4 page rap             sheet for a single arrest/offense/conviction by the time             they rewrite charges, which is common in, you guessed it:             dope cases, and propably will be in crypto cases as the             Federales discover more evidence (planted, decoded,             whatever?).
        e)  You know, I'm beginning to like Mississippi's statutory             rape laws better all the time.  The age is 18, as high it             goes in all 50 states --but it only applies if the minor             female is over 12 and can prove she is a virgin...  yeah,             right, where the only virgin over eight can run faster than             her brothers...
        e)  prisons are big business; and, government has undertaken a
            program of privatization of the prison system --in other             words, the big government oriented contractors, like SAIC             chaired by Bobby Inman, are planning to make a profit             housing government misjustice. do they like to make money?
            does this sound like slave labour to you?             sounds like government 'letting' of business. P.J. O'Rourke             has the definitive result of that:                   "When buying and selling are controlled by legislation,                 the first things to be bought and sold are legislators"          well, I'm too old for the civil disobedience game or deliberately begging the law; I do not wish to head for the 3 hots ad a cot of federal hospitality wearing more years than I can carry.         but you'd better believe and if you wish to even try to beat     the government back, don't think you have any rights in America.  Just remember Judge Roy Bean is sitting in his large $1,500-2,000 comforatable chair about a meter above you, smiling down on you as you sit in the hard, cold, flimsy chair of the dock, after our esteemed judge got drunk last night with his cronies.  After all, Judge Roy, who's only human, suffers from an inferiority complex, and needs a power rush. And after this poor excuse for a human lays 3 fives running wild (15) and 6 tail on you, try smiling at the judge; then say: "thank you your honor, but you're just another fuckin' drunk."   ==     ====== ORIGINAL MESSAGE ======

        just a little bit too close, is it not?  The Kremlin then, and
    the Kremlin of Yeltsin also suffer the same malady: the personal
    expression of power. Gorbi will be remembered in history as not a
    great statesmen as he was initially hailed in the West, but as the
    'great concessionaire,' giving Russia's "imperial" power away.     Russia never had a communist government, it was a dictatorship
    somewhat tempered by the power of the apparati (which under Stalin
    was a joke); it just so happened they practiced the art of the
    commune in collective farming --except they stole the bulk of the
    communes' production.  Any concept of the commune ownership was
    fantasy.         but the bottom line with Brezhnev was the "drunk with power" of
    each of the petty fiefdoms.  Old Joe and Beria is a perfect example,
    except Joe took care of his problem promptly to prove the rule that
    'thou shall not covet thy boss...'.         compare today in Russia: Lebed is a prime example. Even under
    Brezhnev he would have walked the one way tunnel. Fact is, it
    appears Lebed has been closer to the mark than the rest of the
    pompous fools; but that certainly has not helped if one considers
    Lebed would need to assume absolute power in order to clear the
    errant course of the Russian ship of state --absolute power corrupts
    absolutely.         the US has two or three power factors depending on your point of
    view. The visible US government with a totally corrupt and
    depiscable asshole at the helm --a sublimely and malignantly corrupt
    man installed as a puppet gone drunk on his cocaine power pack;  he
    thinks he has shaken his masters and his battle is to control the
    CIA and the rest of the hidden spook show.  Even his loyal puppy,
    John Deutsch, was unable to control the CIA, let alone the rest of
    the apparati.  The lame duck cabinet is more impotent than the last,
    who almost to a man jumped as rats from a sinking ship.  His thrust
    for power is masked in rhetoric of "for the good of the country" or
    "to protect the country from the evils of private speech which might
    be criminal or subversive" that we may all be free.  Is it
    coincidence free speech is the cornerstone of democracy?         So who does control the real apparati?  check behind the silent
    curtains of the dark drawing rooms; check behind the facade of US
    Department of State postings since WWII, and compare names with
    events and the social register and the rolls of Harvard, Yale, and
    Princeton; check the bunkers at Fort Meade and other places; check
    the shadows and the denials; particularly check the denials.         don't wast your time with the myriad of 'culprits' starting with
    the Bilderbergers, the CFR, the TLA, the Bavarian Illuminati, etc.     they are just drinking clubs of the power hungry united only by a
    common greed.  greed and absolute power as America careens into
    history and disenfranchisement.         is there then still a third force?  speculation?  fact!     avengers?  too little, too late?  hunted to the status of endangered
    species or even to extinction?  sacrificial lambs or goats for the

@_subject: YEEHAW! Tobacco argument heats up in AZ 
summary: AZ AG filed for an injunction in the public interest
    to stop the sale of tobacco in AZ.  tobacco company response     claimed he was infringing on legislative rights...   full story is
    below.
        pure warmed-over buffalo chips --the tobacco interests.          ...create a conflict between the judiciary and the legislative
    branches since the judiciary can ban the sale of something the     legislative branch has decided to regulate and collect taxes     from ...  ?
        where did this boy learn his logic, let alone his law (of     course, who ever said any lawyer used logic any more than
    statistics are used to defend lies?)
        big tobacco will spend at least $200 million, maybe even $1
    billion in advertising and diversions to avoid this one --this is
    not a tort issue with delayable appeals --this is injunctive
    relief which could stop the sale of tobacco in a single hearing.
        bravo! and, I'll bet AZ never passed legislation which states     the death merchants have a mandated "right" to sell tobacco     products, even though the legislature did elect to pass a law to     "regulate" the sale of tobacco.  a mandated right implies     endorsement, and places the endorser in the product liability     chain.         A fine line maybe for the tobacco companies to hang their hats
    on, but a Grand Canyon worth of the state if there has no "right"
    to sell granted --granting a "right to sell" would be tantamount to     endorsing the sale of tobacco products.  this may be the perfect     shot.         let's see how long before the ACLU jumps in!  and, on which
    side will they jump?!?   Is 'smoking' a libertarian privilege     cranted unconditionally to the people despite the side effects,     and collatgeral damage, even if you do not smoke?         This case should draw enough amicus curiae to require an     entirely new complex of libraries just to hold the pleadings,     and an army of law clerks with a massively parallel database     to catalogue and service the briefs.
        I can see the fine hand of the Association of Attorney Generals
    driving this one.  Arizona is constituted just mean enough to take     this kind of action.          Let's see how long it is before the Feds try to step in on the     possible Constitutional grounds of regulating trade between the
    states, or claiming "jurisdiction" under rule 10 FRCP where     the combatants are of differing 'citizenship' AND the amount is
    more than $10,000 (the injunctive relief has no monetary value in
    and of itself) can be moved by any party to the Federal court     having jurisdiction (that was how I prevented AT&T from moving from     NV to NY or NJ where they could stall forever and indulge in the     usual payoffs).
        --as an aside, I wonder if we could ban tobacco sales in Utah     by referendum?  if the population is 70% LDS, the rural more     likely to follow the word of wisdom active members might be enough     to tip the vote on a referendum.  hmmm.  that would send a message
    even McCaffey and Reno would have a problem with --there is no
    medical defense for tobacco.
        As for the loss of revenue argument, the excise taxes the state
    collects from the sale of tobacco certainly does not cover the     increased health costs and the collateral economic and social costs     associated with tobacco related health problems.  the state might     have a net loss position initially, but over the long run, the
    reduced health costs will more than cover the loss of tobacco excise     tax.
        meanwhile, back to prohibition: rolling your own from back     yard weeds is a lot harder than making bathtub gin!

Looks to me like Carl needs to understand justice, U.S. federal     court style. In the first place: "ignorance is no excuse under the     law" -then: ask yourself why the U.S. continues the drug war when     it is obvious to the perverted, ignorant, and bought-off Congress-     person that it will never be won. the answer is simple: it's MONEY.         First, the government makes a fortune by importing drugs, which     they can use for unaccountable programs which are illegal under     law. The money is controlled by the CIA, administration, and the     power brokers in the deal which basically states it all; and,     secondly, there is money in imprisonment. Oh? so then ask yourself     why the federal prisons have tripled in size the last 10 years with     the dope wars.  coincidental?
        now, what does that have to do with crypto?  very simple: as     the US heads closer and closer to the UN Constitution under Bubba's     guidance with Hillary's hands on his balls, crypto can bypass     political thought control.  That will not be acceptable to those     who rule: in the US, or anywhere else.
        "Intimidation is just another form of communication."  (attila)
    and they have intimidated federal judges, and they are intimidating     federal judges, and they will continue to intimdate federal judges.     and, they will continue to feed the media what they want known.
        so, what does that have to do with it?
        a)  the federal government is disenfranchising felons with
            certain types of convictions, including drugs, and all
            offenses against the federal government --cryptography
            is an offense against the federal government since it
            falls under ITAR.
            do you know what disenfranchisement really means: well,
            start with fact you have lost your civil rights --ALL of             them. the man never needs a warrant to take you, anywhere.             anyplace, including your home without knocking --he has             automatic probable cause.
            all federal convictions of the type described carry a tail             --extended probation. in other words, a sadistic, sadonic,             and automatically suspicious federal civil servant OWNS             you. He can visit your employer; he can tell you exactly             how to run your business if you are self-employed; he can             tell you if you can move; he can tell you who you will see             or talk with; and if tells you to polish his apple, get on             your knees and smile while you labour.         b)  no vote --that is the principle meaning of franchise which             is defined as "suffrage."  you are history on that score             unless you manage to convince Bubba to grant you a federal             pardon.
        c)  the federal govenment, through one of their federal money             giveaways is forcing the criminal records onto the drivers'             license.  So far, no state has a check box on the sealed             photo ID, but they will, including a coded offense block.
        d)  now, the big credit bureaus, TRW, Equifax, etc. have added             the collection of data for traffic convictions; so far they             have not added either misdemeanor and felony >>arrests<<             and convictions to the _available_ information, but they             will.  Did you know that you can have a 3 or 4 page rap             sheet for a single arrest/offense/conviction by the time             they rewrite charges, which is common in, you guessed it:             dope cases, and propably will be in crypto cases as the             Federales discover more evidence (planted, decoded,             whatever?).
        e)  You know, I'm beginning to like Mississippi's statutory             rape laws better all the time.  The age is 18, as high it             goes in all 50 states --but it only applies if the minor             female is over 12 and can prove she is a virgin...  yeah,             right, where the only virgin over eight can run faster than             her brothers...
        e)  prisons are big business; and, government has undertaken a
            program of privatization of the prison system --in other             words, the big government oriented contractors, like SAIC             chaired by Bobby Inman, are planning to make a profit             housing government misjustice. do they like to make money?
            does this sound like slave labour to you?             sounds like government 'letting' of business. P.J. O'Rourke             has the definitive result of that:                   "When buying and selling are controlled by legislation,                 the first things to be bought and sold are legislators"          well, I'm too old for the civil disobedience game or deliberately begging the law; I do not wish to head for the 3 hots ad a cot of federal hospitality wearing more years than I can carry.         but you'd better believe and if you wish to even try to beat     the government back, don't think you have any rights in America.  Just remember Judge Roy Bean is sitting in his large $1,500-2,000 comforatable chair about a meter above you, smiling down on you as you sit in the hard, cold, flimsy chair of the dock, after our esteemed judge got drunk last night with his cronies.  After all, Judge Roy, who's only human, suffers from an inferiority complex, and needs a power rush. And after this poor excuse for a human lays 3 fives running wild (15) and 6 tail on you, try smiling at the judge; then say: "thank you your honor, but you're just another fuckin' drunk."   ==     ====== ORIGINAL MESSAGE ======

        It is not so much a conspiracy as it is separate, or even UN,     groups, working for their own interests --who has the stick?--          Unfortunately, too many of them have overlapped by their common     need for a common army, a common taxation system (obviously not     balanced by equity) and the right to non-representative taxation     after they destroy freedom of speech/privacy and take away the     hardware.  worse than middle period Marx utopian liberated     socialism!

What intrigues me the most is that even the very rich can not
    survive in the cesspool they will create.  there will be no     distinguished caste, no educated caste, etc. You will see the     attitude with just barely educated type administrators who will say:     "gifted?"

Despite all the utopian talk about social order, politically     correct unisex, socialism will never deliver enough exceptional     individuals to be able to povide all the pyschologists and social     workers they envision.
        Obviously, the fact the white man is probably less than 15% of     the total population and has over 80% of the industrial wealth tells     you where it starts.  The UN is talking about master agricultual     product control warehousing and distribution.
        If 20% of the population is well fed, does that include the US,     Canada, Russia (that's a joke), and the grain producing areas of the     world?   or will the white man be just part of the rest --hungry?

greed and the internet
        our network provider (MCI) has been gradually burying our T1     trunk and the effective feed has been reduced to 1200 baud from     1.56 Megabaud; that, and add 20 seconds to 5+ minutes of packet     hold, and it is now worthless. they claim they will have increased
    capacity, but there are no pressing big money commercial interests
    on this feeder --so when?          Problem is not just here --everywhere; the greedy commercial     bastards have oversold their network space intentionally as they     are bucking for per packet and timed usage charges which are     currently prohibited by the FCC and the state PUCs. The FCC is the     key since other than the local network, which is burdened with the     costs of the trunk, everything is regulated by the FCC which is     trying to totally eliminate the state PUCs in the 105th Congress,         Newt's mouth not withstanding.
        The FCC agreed to review the matter, capitulating to     big greed interests, which will make the Internet a rich man's     toy. $19.95/month plus access charges will increase to thousands     of dollars per month; slow networks make toast of the free hours     and overtime kills.  Without the creative input of the multitude,     there will be no content, so why have a net other than for     commercial purposes? suites the misinformation cabal just fine.
    come up again, and again, until it passes.
        The Internet will no no longer be the peoples net, and the     commercial greedies are establishing a faster, more secure     network with controlled access points; leaving the common man's     access in the mud, still paying the exorbitant rates on a pay     before play basis.  That, and it gives control of information to     the government --which, as we all know. is 'heavenly white'     -above sin.
        Universities are being bought off with the 'Internet II'     proposal which provides super trunks of over 600 Megabaud     capacity, a 400 times improvement. All of this feeds into five     stategically placed super-hubs where Uncle's shadow government can     monitor everything.
        The Internet was supposed to be our freedom: freedom of     information and government in the sunshine, but government is     proving it is still bigger, faster, and badder by using draconian     rules of illegal regulatory agencies. agencies which are usurping     rights limited to the legislative branch.

Just remember Judge Roy Bean is sitting in his large $1,500-2,000 comforatable chair about a meter above you, smiling down on you as you sit in the hard, cold, flimsy chair of the dock, after our esteemed judge got drunk last night with his cronies.  After all, Judge Roy, who's only human, suffers from an inferiority complex, and needs a power rush. And after this poor excuse for a human lays 3 fives running wild (15) and 6 tail on you, try smiling at the judge; then say: "thank you your honor, but you're just another fuckin' drunk."   ==     ====== ORIGINAL MESSAGE ======

@_subject: YEEHAW! Tobacco argument heats up in AZ 
summary: AZ AG filed for an injunction in the public interest
    to stop the sale of tobacco in AZ.  tobacco company response     claimed he was infringing on legislative rights...   full story is
    below.
        pure warmed-over buffalo chips --the tobacco interests.          ...create a conflict between the judiciary and the legislative
    branches since the judiciary can ban the sale of something the     legislative branch has decided to regulate and collect taxes     from ...  ?
        where did this boy learn his logic, let alone his law (of     course, who ever said any lawyer used logic any more than
    statistics are used to defend lies?)
        big tobacco will spend at least $200 million, maybe even $1
    billion in advertising and diversions to avoid this one --this is
    not a tort issue with delayable appeals --this is injunctive
    relief which could stop the sale of tobacco in a single hearing.
        bravo! and, I'll bet AZ never passed legislation which states     the death merchants have a mandated "right" to sell tobacco     products, even though the legislature did elect to pass a law to     "regulate" the sale of tobacco.  a mandated right implies     endorsement, and places the endorser in the product liability     chain.         A fine line maybe for the tobacco companies to hang their hats
    on, but a Grand Canyon worth of the state if there has no "right"
    to sell granted --granting a "right to sell" would be tantamount to     endorsing the sale of tobacco products.  this may be the perfect     shot.         let's see how long before the ACLU jumps in!  and, on which
    side will they jump?!?   Is 'smoking' a libertarian privilege     cranted unconditionally to the people despite the side effects,     and collatgeral damage, even if you do not smoke?         This case should draw enough amicus curiae to require an     entirely new complex of libraries just to hold the pleadings,     and an army of law clerks with a massively parallel database     to catalogue and service the briefs.
        I can see the fine hand of the Association of Attorney Generals
    driving this one.  Arizona is constituted just mean enough to take     this kind of action.          Let's see how long it is before the Feds try to step in on the     possible Constitutional grounds of regulating trade between the
    states, or claiming "jurisdiction" under rule 10 FRCP where     the combatants are of differing 'citizenship' AND the amount is
    more than $10,000 (the injunctive relief has no monetary value in
    and of itself) can be moved by any party to the Federal court     having jurisdiction (that was how I prevented AT&T from moving from     NV to NY or NJ where they could stall forever and indulge in the     usual payoffs).
        --as an aside, I wonder if we could ban tobacco sales in Utah     by referendum?  if the population is 70% LDS, the rural more     likely to follow the word of wisdom active members might be enough     to tip the vote on a referendum.  hmmm.  that would send a message
    even McCaffey and Reno would have a problem with --there is no
    medical defense for tobacco.
        As for the loss of revenue argument, the excise taxes the state
    collects from the sale of tobacco certainly does not cover the     increased health costs and the collateral economic and social costs     associated with tobacco related health problems.  the state might     have a net loss position initially, but over the long run, the
    reduced health costs will more than cover the loss of tobacco excise     tax.
        meanwhile, back to prohibition: rolling your own from back     yard weeds is a lot harder than making bathtub gin!

::            Tobacco industry seeks dismissal of Arizona case
::                     ::      PHOENIX, Arizona (Reuter) - The tobacco industry filed
:: motions on Tuesday in a bid to dismiss the Arizona Attorney
:: General's law suit which seeks to ban the sale of tobacco in the
:: state.
::      Lawyers for two of the defendants, Brown & Williamson
:: Tobacco Corp. and Philip Morris Cos Inc. (MO.N), said in a
:: statement the proposed ban would eliminate tax revenue from the
:: sale of tobacco which is used to fund healthcare and education
:: programs statewide.
::      "We have filed motions asking the court ... whether these
:: claims should be permitted to proceed,'' said William Maledon a
:: lawyer at Osborn Maledon which represents Philip Morris Inc.
:: "We believe it is clear that the Attorney General has no
:: authority to initiate at least six of the 11 claims he has
:: brought,'' he said.
::      The tobacco industry on Tuesday filed eight motions to
:: dismiss the suit in Maricopa County Superior Court in Arizona.
:: The Arizona lawsuit against the tobacco industry was filed
:: in August and amended by the state's attorney general in
:: November.
::      The suit seeks to ban the sale of tobacco products statewide
:: and recover increased healthcare insurance premiums the state
:: alleges to have paid for ``tobacco-related illnesses'' by state
:: employees and their dependents.
::      The suit also seeks ``corrective'' advertising and funding
:: of programs to help people give up smoking as well as
:: unspecified damages for alleged consumer fraud, restraint of
:: trade and civil racketeering.
::      Paul Eckstein, an attorney with Brown & Bain which
:: represents Brown & Williamson, said Arizona would suffer should
::  the attorney general win the suit.
::      "If the Attorney General prevails on this public nuisance
:: argument, the tobacco tax revenue source would be eliminated
:: without legislative input,'' he said.
::      "This raises the question of which state programs would be
:: eliminated for lack of funding,'' he added.
::      The lawyers said Arizona collected $650.5 million in tobacco
:: excise taxes from 1980 through 1993 and that the state will
:: collect another $167.5 million in fiscal 1996.
::      "The Arizona Legislature has not chosen to ban the sale or
:: use of tobacco, but rather regulate and profit from it,''
:: Eckstein said. ``This lawsuit would create a direct and
:: irreconcilable conflict between the judicial and legislative
:: branches of government.''

        Other than the fact the nudist might be a real loser, I could     care less about a nym;  there are multiple users on other nyms (for     all we know, Tim May is a nym and the name is common); you can     usually guess by context who is who.  how many of us have actually     seen each other face to face (who would want to )?  so, in most     cases, real names are no different than nyms in a make believe     world.

    as to trivializing tim may as to wine and for his comment below on     OKC, if the gubmit becomes a terrorist state (and who is to deny     that it is not, and has not been this century), then the terrorist     much expect retaliation.      The US in this century, at one point or another in time, has     destabilized 90%+ of the world governments, including the Labour
    Party in GB prior to Iron Maggie's rule (and if you want names of     the phony US Dept of State consular employees involved, a pointer     can be provided).
    turnabout will be increasingly fairplay.  certainly not by me --too     old and far too disinterested to waste energy on a foolish
    self-perpetuating fraud when the majority of ignorance prefers
    security over freedom.
    as for McVeigh: either there were a whole group of people involved     to be able to satchel the building columns, or the government was     the driving force.  and why was the *entire* ATF staff elsewhere?      OKC came at a perfect time to help Clintons' drive to push     anti-terrorist legislation to deny personal freedoms "...for the     common good."  draw your own conclusions; it's only history     repeating itself --noone listened the first couple hundred times.
    as for the great fairweather liberal bigot Blanc's passing it off     as tcm's drunken ramblings, I doubt it.  war is hell, and     "innocents" get wasted --but, a society at war has no innocents.      blow 'em all away.  scorched earth is inadequate; burnt earth is     more effective. if there are no prisoners, there are no     complainers.

attila sez:
    Dresden was probably the first highly visible of America's
    willingness to literally destroy civilian populations with the
    express intent of demoralizing a nation.  however, history seems
    to indicate in was a Churchillian "revenge" for the Blitz carried
    out by both British and American bombers --however, the latter
    were capable of greated payloads at greater range.  apparently
    the American bombers carried primarily heavy ordinance, the     British lit it up --however, the functions were probably mixed.
    Hiroshima may have been later, but Dresden set the stage. Hiroshime     undoubtedly saved hundreds of thousands of both US troops and     Japanese civilians from further war --the Emporer stepped in and     made the broadcast without the approval of the general staff     --basically, "enough is enough."  Dresden served virtually no     purpose on the German front --the war was over. Churchill and     Roosevelt approved Dresden for revenge; Truman just ended a war.
    Obliterating Iraq and continuing to grind the heel is just another     round of power politics and US Middle East foreign policy.  To the
    rest of the world, the US is a militaristic bully bent on economic
    advantage -- the old British lion reincarnated.
    government is its own end:  power corrupts, and absolute power     corrupts absolutely.  hasn't changed yet in history.  even the     greats, Solomon, David, etc. fell prey to the siren song of power;
    why should far more inferior men like Bubba, who has absolutely     nothing to his credit except deceit, be exempt?

    thanx, Dimitri, I could not have replied more eloquently myself.
        and, I never had complainers after burnt earth actions. Kent
    is obviously jealous and angry he was not along for the ride 30+
    years ago.
    actually, I did abhor the policy sufficiently to resign a     commission w/o benefits and to suffer their standard means of
    discredit.
    I guess Kent is still wet behind the ears, no use wasting the time
    to clue him in on Hr. Doktor Professor....  ______________________________________________________________________

    aw, come on, Kent --you remind me of the faggots dancing around
    Harvard Square in 1960 when TOCSIN was in its heyday before it
    became SANE.       jocks used to go down there on Saturday mornings to bait them
    into attacking so the Irish cops could bust them.  some peaceniks
    managed to be rather violent with their placards.
    If you have not figured it out --government is the *enabler*
    to corrupt absolute power.
    I just love idealistic peaceniks, the better ones taste just like     chicken.

pro-balance? JAFR --just another form of regulation. the concept
    of free thought for anyone outside of the inner circle has never
    occurred to Hillary. does Chelsea view Hillary as her "mother" or
    as an automan who conceived her before her clocked ticked out?
    all the show of family is a sham for Hillary; Hillary is straight
    out of "Logan's Run" and automated child care --the global village
    concept of procreation, child rearing, and education in a protypical
    defined environment to the party line.
    even Kathy picked up on that one!
    if you print a newspaper, you can not retract the comment (but
    the distribution is less). the government will attack the     remailers on accountability, yet the courts have consistently
    ruled on the constitutionality of anonymous handbills.     why do they not come out and state what their real agenda is?
    the internet is not the controlled media (the gatekeepers of
    Hillary's later comments --in fact that is the most direct
    reference to government leaning on the press I have seen in
    print by a high ranking power behind the throne.
    the issue is that the internet strikes fear in the hearts of
    the scalawags, bounders, and highwaymen posing as our elected
    representatives to what was _our_ republic.
