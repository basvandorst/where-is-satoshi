FROM THE DESK OF CHIEF DUMEBI ODILI.
DEAR SIR,
WE ARE SENDING THIS LETTER TO YOU BASED ON INFORMATION
GATHERED FROM THE FOREIGN TRADE OFFICE OF THE NIGERIAN
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY. WE BELIEVE THAT YOU WOULD BE IN A POSITION TO HELP US IN OUR BID TO
THE SUM OF FORTY-ONE MILLION,FIVE HUNDRED
THOUSAND DOLLARS ($41.5M USD) INTO A FOREIGN ACCOUNT. PLANNING OF THE MINISTRY OF PETROLEUM, THIS COMMITTEE
WE ARE MEMBERS OF THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE FOR BUDGET AND
IS PRINCIPALLY CONCERNED WITH CONTRACT APPRAISALS AND
APPROVAL OF CONTRACTS IN ORDER OF PRIORITIES AS
REGARDS CAPITAL PROJECT OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF
NIGERIA. WITH OUR POSITIONS, WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY
SECURED FOR OURSELVES THE SUM OF FORTY-ONE MILLION,
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATE DOLLARS(US$41.5M).
THIS AMOUNT WAS ACCUMULATED THROUGH UNDECLARED WINFALL
FROM SALES OF CRUDE OIL DURING THE GULF WAR.
WHAT WE NEED FROM YOU IS TO PROVIDE A SAFE ACCOUNT
INTO WHICH THE FUNDS WILL BE TRANSFERRED SINCE
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ARE NOT  ALLOWED BY OUR LAWS TO
OPERATE FOREIGN ACCOUNT. IT HAS BEEN AGREED THAT THE
OWNER OF THE ACCOUNT WILL BE COMPENSATED WITH US$8.3
MILLION OF THE REMITTED FUNDS, WE KEEP
US$31.125MILLION WHILE US$2.075MILLION WILL BE SET
ASIDE TO OFFSET EXPENSES AND PAY THE NECESSARY TAXES.
IT MAY INTEREST YOU TO KNOW THAT TWO YEARS AGO A
SIMILAR TRANSACTION WAS CARRIED OUT WITH ONE MR.
PATRICE MILLER, THE PRESIDENT OF CRAINE INTERNATIONAL
TRADING CORPORATION AT NUMBER 135, EAST 57TH STREET,
28TH FLOOR, NEW YORK 10022 WITH TELEPHONE
(212)308-7788 AND TELEX NUMBER 6731689, AFTER THE
AGREEMENT BETWEEN BOTH PARTNERS IN WHICH HE WAS TO
TAKE 25% THE MONEY WAS DULY TRANSFERRED INTO HIS
ACCOUNT ONLY TO BE DISAPPOINTED ON OUR ARRIVAL IN NEW
YORK AS WE WERE RELIABLY INFORMED THAT MR. PATRICE
MILLER WAS NO LONGER ON THAT ADDRESS WHILE HIS
TELEPHONE AND TELEX NUMBERS HAVE BEEN REALLOCATED TO
SOMEBODY ELSE, THAT IS HOW WE LOST US$27.5M TO MR
PATRICE MILLER.
THIS TIME AROUND WE NEED A MORE RELIABLE AND
TRUSTWORTHY PERSON OR A REPUTABLE COMPANY TO DO
BUSINESS WITH HENCE THIS LETTER TO YOU, SO IF YOU CAN
PROVE YOURSELF TO BE TRUSTED AND INTERESTED IN THIS
DEAL THEN WE ARE PREPARED TO DO BUSINESS WITH YOU.
WHAT WE WANT FROM YOU IS THE ASSURANCE THAT YOU WILL
LET US HAVE OUR SHARE WHEN THIS AMOUNT OF US$41.5M IS
TRANSFERRED INTO YOUR ACCOUNT.
IF THIS PROPOSAL SATISFIES YOU, PLEASE CONTACT ME
STRICTLY THROUGH MY E-MAIL STATED ABOVE  SO WE CAN
ADVICE YOU ON THE MODALITIES OF THE TRANSACTION. ALL
MODALITIES OF THE TRANSFER HAVE BEEN WORKED OUT AND
ONCE STARTED WILL NOT TAKE MORE THAN 14 WORKING DAYS

TRANSACTION IS 100% SAFE.
PLEASE TREAT AS URGENT AND VERY CONFIDENTIAL. GOD BE
WITH YOU AS I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR REPLY. BEST REGARDS.
