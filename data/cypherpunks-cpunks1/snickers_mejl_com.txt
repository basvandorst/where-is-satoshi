Another possible "ultimate end" for the spammer wars would be making
spamming illegal, like fax spamming, and having the cops hunting down the
spammers. But that can be defeated with truly anonymous markets, still
assuming that encryption will be legal.
To really beat spamming we probably need filters that only allow messages
from inside our web of trust. Don't you agree?
