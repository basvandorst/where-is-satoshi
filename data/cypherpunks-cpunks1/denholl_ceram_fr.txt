@_subject: OGY, chaotic scrambling 
A few years back i ran thru a paper emanating
from a navy labs researcher (i think the name was Peccora)
about using synchronised chaotic signal generators as a
signal scrambling/encrytpion scheme.
Has there been any kind of progress in this line of work,
practical applications ?
