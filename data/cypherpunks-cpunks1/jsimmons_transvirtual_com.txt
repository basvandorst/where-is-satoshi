Sorry this is off topic but this was way to good :-)           Virus writers can use the DMCA in a perverse way. Because
   computer viruses are programs, they can be copyrighted just like a
   book, song, or movie. If a virus writer were to use encryption to
   the code of a virus, an anti-virus company could be forbidden by
   DMCA to see how the virus works without first getting the
   of the virus writer. If they didn't, a virus writer could sue the
   anti-virus company under the DMCA!
