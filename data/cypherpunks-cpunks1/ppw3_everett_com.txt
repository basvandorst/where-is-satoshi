@_subject: Why Fingerprints and Key-ID's 
I understand PGP Open-Signed messages and why they are used. I've read all the FAQ's. I can't seem to figure out why some of us put our Fingerprints and/or Key-ID's at the end of messages.
The answer to my question is probably in a FAQ somewhere and I'm missing it, I learn best by watching (visually) or by doing (experientially) so I'm having a little trouble learning from In any case, if someone would spend a little time to explain, or point me in the right direction, I would be grateful.
