@_subject: wikileaks dns (was Re: Blocking International DNS) 
so, if the site to which a dns entry points suffers a ddos, everydns
will no longer serve the domain.  i hope they apply this policy even
handedly to all sufferers of ddos.
if not, as a registrar, i guess i can no longer accept registrations
where everydns is the ns delegatee.

as someone who has done a lot of tunneling, uucping, funny routing
relays, ... for democratic movements in lots of countries, i am not
pleased at seeing the need arise in the so-called democratic states.

@_subject: skype shoots self in foot 
skype seems to have made the latest 6.x incompatible with 2.8 (which
folk who care about screen real estate run) in that video no longer
works between them.
until widespread availability of webrtc, a bunch of us are using
jitsi for video,    o uses open standard protocols
  o free, open source, apple pie, ...
  o supports opus codec which has really good performance across a
    wide range of bandwidth   o multi-participant video on xmpp-based videobridge, also open
    source
  o does xmpp, sip, aim, icq, yahoo, ...
i have an ejabberd+videobridge up if folk want test/use accounts.
and it's easy to put up your own, of course.
