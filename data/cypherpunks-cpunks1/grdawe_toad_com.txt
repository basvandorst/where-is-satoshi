IMHO etc., *any* time there is an application involving pattern-matching and analysis of complex in->out relations/functions there is a possible application of NN's.  That's not to say that a particular application would be a panacea, but designed properly I think an NN could be of value in differential crypto, discovering crypto-weak (i.e. strong) correlations between in->out, etc.  My intuition says there is or can be value as a tool for the cryptanalyst.
I would also not discount the use of NN's in ENcrypting, given the capability of NN's realizing (almost) any arbitrary, nonlinear function from in->out. Caveat: practical considerations not accounted for in these opinions. Has anyone tried using neural nets or similar techniques for
searching for useful nonrandom properties of the round functions of
block ciphers or hash functions?  This might be useful in trying to
prepare some new kind of attack, find a balanced binary function
that is useful in using the generalization of linear cryptanalysis
discussed by Harpes, Kramer, and Massey at Eurocrypt '95, find a
better "difference" function for use in a differential attack, etc.
Merkle's paper on Khufu and Khafre addresses this idea, I think.
Merkle comments that it's not going to be useful against a full
cipher, but that it might be useful against (say) Khufu with one or
two octets.
Note:  Please respond via e-mail as well as or instead of posting,
as I get CP-LITE instead of the whole list.
