This plan is abhorrent and reeks of Big Brother.
into the twenty-first century. This proposal is bringing us to 1984.
First I will mention technical reasons why the system is inadequate.
people will be allowed to examine the algorithim for flaws. The members
of the cryptographic community emphasize that the only way to make sure
that a cryptographic system is secure is to have as many people as
possible analyze and try to break it for as long as possible. A system
which has been examined by a small segment of the population will not be
trusted to be secure.
attacked by brute-force. The encryption key is only eighty bits long.
Such a small key lends itself to easy decryption by an unauthorized
party. It would lend a false sense of security to laypersons in the
field who do not realize that a key of such simplicity could be cracked
easily by any talented criminal.
political problems with the recent big brother proposal. First, there is
the assumption that the government has a right to spy on its own
citizens. The proposal for this wiretap chip includes the registration
of keys with two escrow agencies.  This is purported to allow law
enforcement to keep track of "terrorists" and "drug-dealers." The first
flaw in this key-escrow system is that no self-respecting criminal will
use a cryptography system which can be easily tapped by law enforcement
officials-- they will use strong cryptography. Thus the only people who
may end up using the wiretap encryption system will be law-abiding
laypeople who don't fully understand cryptography. (Law-abiding citizens
who do understand cryptography will use strong cryptography to preserve
their privacy from a talented criminal.) chip user a law enforcement agency must first establish that they have a
valid interest in the key. Translated out of legalese, that means that
all a government agency will have to do to get access to all of the
private communications between, for example, a lawyer and her client
will be to fill out the necessary forms. Registering cryptographic keys
with the government is similar to giving the IRS the keys to your house
and filing cabinet.
release stated that the Attorney shall request (i.e. coerce)
telecommunication product manufacturers to use this product.  This
aspect of the system is a government-mandated monopoly. Such monopolies
result in high prices and the elimination of market forces which drive
the improvement of technology. (One needs only look at the state of the
Soviet Union to see how the lack of market forces affects consumer
chip becomes the standard, strong cryptography will be declared illegal.
If such is the case, then only criminals will have access to strong
cryptography. As I have stated above-- the wiretap chip will not be used
by criminals because of the obvious flaws in the crypto-system--
criminals will use strong crypto, while law-abiding citizens will have
to use a system which can be easily defeated by any criminal.
-free-. Strong cryptography for voice communications for -free- is only
a few months away for people who own a personal computer. There is no
way that making strong cryptography illegal will stop it-- it will only
turn otherwise law-abiding citizens into criminals.

to Pres. Clinton, signing it with digital signatures, but that was in a
joking manner. To me it seems like a good idea. What do others think?
people would create "signature certificates" and forward those to the
person sending the petition-- once all the signatures are collected then
the petition and all the certificates would be sent together? I'd
imagine that the signatures certs could be sent in a different package
than the petition, but I don't think Clinton's aides would be able to
recognize that all the certificates belong with the petition.)

put you on their mailing list, compile statistics about who you are,
etc., as we all know.
pay for it with digital cash, communicating with the vendor through the
anonymous remailers. Now I see a problem in how the vendor will deliver
the product. Obviously I can give the vendor my email address encrypted
with the remailer's public keys, so the vendor still doesn't know who I
am. But the vendor can still keep a database of address-blocks and which
address blocks go with which purchases. Then the vendor can compile her
mailing list of address blocks, and even *sell* this list to others,
with product purchase history. Even though the junk-mailers don't know
who I am, they can still flood my box with email.
The vendor could simply post publicly (to usenet or something) the
product I wanted, encrypted with my public key. (Rather, a public key I
created just for this venture with a psuedonym so that none could
see that it was I who was buying from the vendor.) The bandwidth for
this thing would be incredible.
create the return-address block, it can be given some sort of ID-code
(again, like with my other idea posted, similar to the ID-code on peices
of Digicash in Chaum's scheme) so when the vendor delivers the product,
she sends to encrypted block to the remailer, and the remailer forwards
the product to me, and stores the ID-code in its database (doing the
proper one-way transformation for untraceability) so that further
attempts to use the exact same address-block will be noticed and not
pay for remailer transactions, so that sending junk mail through a
remailer would be prohibitively expensive. It will probably happen
anyway once we near the goal of full crypto-anarchy that most remailers
will not operate without a fee, while the scheme I present above seems
like it would work with both free remailers and those which charge for
usage. (And a charge on a remailer which agrees with the market probably
won't be high enough to stop a really rich junk mailer from spending the
cash on junk mailings.)
