approval for version 2.0.  However, let's keep the developer/publisher
out of the loop.  How about someone developing a 'binary diff', using
the functionality of nm to find subroutine entry points, and then doing
the binary diff from those starting points?  Presumably, for most of the
program the diff would mostly be changed entry points, with the bulk of
diff being the crypto module.  Then the bdiff gets exported, and
bpatch-ed into the export binary.  Of course, this wouldn't work if they
strip the binary, but who is going to force them to do that?

I postulated a couple of months ago about how the US Govt might attempt
to censor the rest of the world: "Remove lurid.porno.site.other-country
from your DNS system within 72 hours or we will remove references to
your DNS servers from the root level servers.".  (I also speculated that
if the US Govt tried doing this, that an 'underground' DNS system would

But, if an Internet 'Decency' law was passed, they certainly could try
to threaten the US-based root server maintainers to make the cascading
threats.  And, as I understand the way DNS resolution works, address
requests go down to your root domain then up from the other root domain,
i.e., for me to find out what c2.org's address is, my system requests
NS mpd.tandem.com
NS tandem.com
NS com
NS org
If this is correct, if the com NS has the entry for the org NS, I won't
be able to resolve those names.  Of course, explicit IP addresses and

the credit available (online authorization) vs those who trust you to
have it (no online authorization).  As I understand it, the fee is
'insurance' that the merchant will be paid - as long as there is no
fraud on the part of the merchant, it will receive payment, even if the
charge was invalid, because the card was canceled/stolen/over limit/etc.
The lower charge for online authorization is because when the charge
comes back approved, the CC company is able to verify that the credit is
there.  This isn't foolproof (2 separate charges, each under the
available credit, can be approved even if the total exceeds the
available credit), but it's more than the offline merchants can do.
