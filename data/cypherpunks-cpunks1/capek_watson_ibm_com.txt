@_subject: Medium destruction 
I have no firsthand knowledge, but a friend who was into this a few years ago
told me that the following is used for NSA's "best stuff" on paper...
     First, it is shredded.
     Then, it is burned.
     Then, the ashes are soaked in acid
     Then the acid is allowed to evaporate and the resulting mass is formed
          into bricks.
     The bricks are dumped at sea at a classified location which is changed
          weekly.
Maybe he was putting me on, but...
A few years ago, the American embassy in (I think) Teheran was invaded by
mobs of locals.   They apparently managed to get hold of a lot of classified
documents which had been shredded in the minutes before they managed to
break in.  But a few months later, there appeared in the New York Times
reconstructions of a few pages of the original material, based on a lot of
tedious labor.  So, maybe the procedures above aren't excessive...

@_subject: Color Copiers 
I suspect the desire to have color copiers "attended" is more a matter of
controlling cost than anything else.  I heard some years ago that the
Secret Service had asked manufacturers who were working on color copiers to
"strut their stuff" and demonstrate the best copies they could make of
US currency.  The SS was aghast at the results, and I believe these results
were at least part of the motivation for the anti-counterfeiting measures
recently introduced, such as the microprinting on $50 and $100 bills.  There
is also alleged to have been an effort by the government to degrade the
quality the machines could deliver, or to make "equal size" copying unavailable
(and provide only 5% reduction/increase at a minimum).  Apparently Xerox said
something to the effect of "Nothing doing; we worked for years to get it this
good and aren't going to degrade it to solve your problem."  Amen.

@_subject: 10/28 - Crypto Day at IBM Research, Yorktown Heights, NY 
***********************************************************
   Cryptography Day at IBM Yorktown           October 28, 1993
   Thomas J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights New York
   ***********************************************************
Once the province of diplomats and spies, cryptography is assuming
a central role in civil applications, including digital telephony,
electronic mail, database access, software copy protection, funds
transfer and contract negotiation.  As these services become
more powerful and globally integrated, cryptographic techniques
provide the chief means of reconciling the conflicting goals of
privacy and accessibility.  This day-long symposium will explore
the emerging intersection of cryptographic algorithms, devices,
applications, and policy that is shaping the future of
information services.
Topics to be covered include
+ A survey of cryptography and related techniques
+ The role of cryptography in information distribution and licensing
+ Electronic privacy
+ Smart cards
+ Evolution of the regulatory framework and international standards
Speakers include
Richard Barth           Council on Competitiveness, Washington, DC
Gilles Brassard         Universite de Montreal, Canada
Whitfield Diffie        Sun Microsystems, Sunnyvale, CA
Charles Hartman         IBM Personal Systems Multimedia, Mountain View, CA
Jean-Jacques Quisquater Universite Catholique, Louvain,  Belgium
The symposium will involve no proprietary or confidential
information.  There will be no registration fee, but
           ADVANCE REGISTRATION IS REQUIRED.

Pardon me if this has already been mentioned here -- I haven't noticed it --
but an article of considerable interest to this group has just been published..
The May 1994 issue of the IBM Journal of Research and Development contains
"The Data Encryption Standard (DES) and its strength against attacks" by
Don Coppersmith of IBM Research, who participated in the design and testing
of DES, particularly in the design of the famous S-boxes.  Included in the
paper is a discussion of differential cryptanalysis and what was done to
thwart that kind of attack.
