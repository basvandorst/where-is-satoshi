Hi Alan,
I thought he was refering to that too, but notice
he says the beep is before the negotiation, just
after the dialing.
Bye for now.

Hey guys,
I wasn't suggesting that they do record exactly where everyone is
at the highest resolution possible.
Just suggesting that should they want to investigate an individual,
they could do it with pretty high detail.
Though I'm sure they'd record when and where you switch your
phone on, switch off / loose signal, switch cells and make and
receive calls and messages. That wouldn't be all that much data.
Bye for now.

Hey all,
Just wondering what people think of this product?
Good, bad or ugly?
Is there an international version and a US version?
If so, what limitations are in the international version?
Many thanks...

Hi William,
Many thanks for the reply.
I was hoping it was ok having Blowfish,
but I guess it could be their own
"efficient" version.
Bye for now.

Hi guys,
If I could get access to the source,
understand all of it fully, and understand
how it will act under Win95 with whatever
compiler they used, I could probably write
my own.
So I guess it comes down to trust.
Thanks for the replies.
Bye for now.

Hi all,
Can I have a killfile for Outlook 97
or am I limited to the Inbox assistant?

Hi Stan,
A simple low pass filter made of 2 large inductors and a
few high voltage capacitors will do the trick nicely.
Which is not a slow reacting device being passive.
Combine this with polyswitch style protection and some method
of discharging a really high voltage to ground and it'll be
even better.
A very cheap design that should be in all UPS's.
And is certainly a whole lot better than nothing at all
for removing harzardous spikes, etc.

Hi Stan,
Since the big powersupply transformer primary winding
is in _parallel_ with the AC power coming from the wall,
this inductor will transfer the spikes, etc to the
secondary winding and into the bridge rectifier, etc quite
nicely. But decent ripple prevention should also help out
here. Though this hasn't much to do with PC switchmode
An inductor/capacitor spike filter that may be in UPS'
would have 2 large inductors in _series_ with the active
and neutral and high voltage capacitors in parallel with
both ends of the inductors across the active and neutral.
This is specifically designed as a low pass filter for
getting rid of spikes.
I don't think the SW supply would do it quite as well with
as much power handling, strength etc. I'd rather a great
big low pass filter designed for spike dampening doing the
deed than having my PC power supply bearing the brunt of it.
It's also an extra layer that is quite cheap.
Bye for now.
