@_subject: [BI] Goverment asking libraries to destroy government reports 
Not only is the government removing much material from its websites it
is also asking depository libraries (which are sent government reports
free) to remove and destroy many government reports--because of the recent terrorist incidents.
Any comments? Any bookdealers destroying books which they think might be useful to terrorists?
Here is a discussion about this at Slashdot  (a popular discussion forum for computer nerds).
