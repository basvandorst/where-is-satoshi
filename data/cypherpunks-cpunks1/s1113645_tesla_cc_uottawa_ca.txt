This sounds like the fine print you "agree" to by opening commercial software
packages. Hasn't this been found void in a couple of places? The "OK"  or "I Agree" buttons I'm forced to press (but you don't *have* to download software, nya,nya,nya...) when downloading wares also comes to mind.
Has this been tested in a court? (Sega's reverse engineering suit from a while back comes to mind)
Pressing buttons is hardly the same as your notarized handwritten signature
on paper (we prefer blood, it's more permanent), or its digital equivalent.

You must mean quantum crypto, by G. Brassard and C. Crepeau of U de Montreal.
Requires a direct fiber optic line from pt. A to B, in order to be secure, if I am not mistaken. Which makes it impractical for most people, as there are usually switches (or whatever they're called) and more than one line in between. Lets you use OTPs with your next-door neighbor though.

I didn't read the Discover article, but I did see it in Applied Crypto, 1st edition. The polarization thing was used for eavesdropper detection, rather than key generation (I think, and I may be quite wrong).
The paper was intended to show that you could have unconditional security
even if P=NP (I even think that was one of the paper titles), so the authors
used a one time pad (and used whatever key generation method is usually used
for OTPs, ie coin flips, real RNGs and whatnot). So nothing special or new with regards to key generation. (Of course they may have newer papers...Any hints folks?)
Incidentally, Brassard wrote a nice and very short intro to modern crypto
that's in the Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.
I think Applied Cryptology was the title. It had good coverage of his quantum
crypto scheme. It ought to be in any university library.

   Electronic snooping part of the game
   OTTAWA (CP)--Intelligence experts say it's no big secret that Canada's
   high-tech spy agency snoops on friendly countries for financial gain.    Increasingly, intelligence agencies around the world are using their
   antennas, computers and codebreakers to gather economic information,
   Wesley Wark, a University of Toronto history professor, said Monday.
   Some of Canada's largest trading partners--including the United
   States, France and Japan--comb the airwaves for useful information, so
   Canada would be foolish not to join the game, said Wark.    Canada's secretive Communications Security Establishment--an arm of
   the Defence Department--collects and analyses communications traffic
   on the activities of foreign states, corporations and people.
   Jane Shorten, a former CSE employee, told CTV News in an interview
   Sunday the agency spied on Canada's allies and trading
   partners--including Mexico and South Korea--by eavesdropping on
   embassies, consulates and diplomats.

   cold war from spying on the russians to spying on allies to get trade
   secrets. prime minister chretien says the organization is supposed to
   operate within the law. chretien says the c-s-e doesn't report to him
   on a daily basis, so he doesn't know if it was spying on anyone.

Barring escrow services, I don't see how contracts (or a lot of other laws) could be enforced against these entities when they can simply pop in and out of existence (unless they have some physical counterpart, like a storefront and merchandise. But then these are easily linkable to True Names, unlike software companies, financial services or any other part of the info economy.)

While I'd love to set one up, I would never do any risky commerce with one.
Besides, if companies in general can set up other companies, in a trustworthy and non-anon jurisdiction, couldn't these foreign anon companies do the same in the present system and therefore make it very hard to know if any company in any country is non-anon? Are there any present legal barriers against this? I don't know much about the requirements of incorporation or the natures
of various types of corporations, so please feel free to correct me.

aren't in Canada (and probably offshore gov run) it is legal for the operators. It is illegal for us North Americans to use though.
I just checked the site and saw quite a few casino operations on the strip.
I didn't notice the ecash logo this time around (I'm doing this off lynx, it might only be shown in the graphical version). Which is what the casino.org page says.
And no economic incentive for the lottery.
What are the regulatory hassles of setting up a gambling operation in one of the US states where it's legal (ie Nevada) ?
I take it it would still be illegal for someone outside the state to gamble using the service.
Isn't there also some Scandinavian bank that's handling ecash? It might be
hard to explain to US tax authorities how large amounts of anon currency
are ending up in one's marktwain account. In that case it might be interesting for someone to setup an anon service provider along the lines
of c2.org which would allow users to run java scripts, no-questions asked
(presuming this is a legal gambling jurisdiction). Java-based casinos, anyone? (or just normal unix c progs, given shell access)
Of course life will be much nicer when Chaum sheds his (*ahem*) ethics
and starts licensing to offshore banks. (I take it Scandinavian taxes are far worse than American ones. I would think they'd be less drug-money-laundering paranoid than the US however. Makes you wonder how
much attention the Fincen boys are giving marktwain at the moment).

I promise myself to go back to lurking mode after this.
None of us have stopped objecting, except that now we have methods of preventing it on our own. One must remember that while the basic uses of crypto are not only reasonable and even essential in some cases, the full
application leads to some very objectionable extremes (regulatory arbitrage, full anon digicash, easier drug sales, gutting of income taxes...). Now being one of those people who enthusiastically supports those extremes,
I have to ask myself, how will we get there with the least interference?
Now for one thing I wouldn't go around repeating the indignant "unconstitutional US government" threads on oh let's say talk.politics.libertarian (or .crypto) to the faces of legislators and the media. One doesn't get the ITAR repealled by telling congress that child porn and mafia conversations will become impossible to police and that
the first amendment lets us shout "fire" in a theatre (though I think it I would leave all the carping and "four horsemen"ing to Louis Freeh.
That makes him sound unreasonable. "Sounding" reasonable may be the best way
for our crowd to keep legal the tools that will help us do "unreasonable" (though not from our perspective) things. So as long as Shabbir & co insert statements supportive of crypto deregulation, I really don't care what the rest of their speeches say, the rest is only packaging.
(Though one must determine what's the packaging and what's the content.)

Algorithms die. If you want to publish and implement an API that will last,
try to improve on of the many multi-algorithm specs that are already out there. If the next round of research kills one particular algorithm, your work will then still not be wasted. (Apologies for writing something so obvious and general.)

see a few crypto bigwigs on coderpunks that haven't seen fit to post to cypherpunks in a very long time, if ever. It'd be nice to keep receiving their input without forcing them into tedious killfiling measures.
Conversely, I don't see why the activists should have to deal with code.
The main list, imho, has mostly become something of a watering hole for the primary crypto user community. Something quite different from the usenet crypto groups.
And since the list is very active regardless of signal, it will still be a place to send out some signal on those occasions where the important thngs occur. They don't (and can't) every day. And usenet just doesn't perform this function properly. I really do think having archives alongside a cypherpunks archive is crucial
for the survival of an offshoot list. Institutional memory is very useful, especially for time-insensitive things like technical discussions.

One of these days I'm going to learn the art of succint writing.
I don't think the rich are really the issue. From what Sandy, Black Unicorn and others write, it looks like those of the rich who are self-employed already play these shell games to a certain extent and a certain amount competition and thumb-screwing already happens.
What is interesting is how it applies to the middle-class, where most of the tax-base is. Imagine a world where for cost reasons most offices are VR constructs (a la Snow Crash and all the others) run over the net. Assume that for privacy reasons, nobody in their right minds goes without crypto
since any cracker could literally be recording their whole lives.
(And assume that this gets built into all the software or the users scream
murder as hard as we did when Netscape's CEO looked like he was waffling on GAK.)
Assume that some enterprising jurisdictions find some *reliable* means of automating entity creation and use of all the offshore services (creation of companies, trusts, doing financial transactions...) and offer a standard API
to these services, making the whole game a commodity and as easy to access as downloading Netscape. Assume that somehow secure pseudonymous financial markets can be created. (Big if, but also big profits) Also assume very low transaction fees as a result.
The result of this might be that the netshore economy might actually have lower overhead and an easier interface to its users than the physical world version. If people's easiest intro to economics and the job market is such a simple anarchy and the place where they get most of their entertainment, education and generally spend most of their lives is such an impossible to regulate environment, what do you think this bodes for state control? Or people's desire for it? There is no teacher like experience. Many of us have found it safer to use a pseudonym, sometimes even to save ourselves from occasional embarassment when saying stupid things (nevermind privacy from altavista and whowhere). I think it is natural for people to want such things, especially in a VR environment when anyone can watch you. I assume that in this the cypherpunks, roleplayers, MUD players, political writers and BBSers are not radical but merely slightly ahead of the curve. It is also not a coincidence that pseudonymity keeps getting reinvented in new environments. Basic human need.
These games have all been possible for quite some time in the offshore market and seem far more developped. I've read that there are as many registered corporations in the Cayman Islands as there are inhabitants. It might actually be less of a hassle to conduct your business as a corporation than as a individual. Even here in high-tax Canada there are nifty tax benefits (I'm told). Foreign jurisdictions might also be easier to deal with as a corporation (do you *really* want the Chinese government
to know that you're doing business with their people? Do you want to get on Saudi Arabia's blacklist?)
How do you think most people will act when they learn that just by putting on their glasses they could enter a tax-free jurisdiction with perfect privacy? THIS meme does travel.
Now many here think that unless we get chaumian ecash Real Soon Now, none of this will happen. I submit that there will be far more demand for it in the years to come than right now. Anonymous ecash is still several years
ahead of its mass-market time. I don't see how in the absence of GAK or any other mandated ID scheme that it will be any easier to stop it (maybe you do). And market share? How can VISA and Microsoft compete against something that lets you save on taxes (why compete *against* it when you can be part of it?). Marketing this is a no-brainer.
The only extra expense I can see is that if you're large enough, you might
need more accountants to help with your double-booking. (Though maybe you
could fire them all if the system is done right)
Finally, how will you regulate disputes? Last week we had just this problem.
Now imagine how these things will be resolved when real money is involved and force cannot be applied. Arbitration is already "in" in the real world...
It's much faster than the average court. What do you think will happen when enough people get exposed to that? Arbitration negotiators (lawyers) might be quite cheaper than real lawyers, after all there's less rules to learn (probably standardized and commoditized) and a global market of them (competition!). Markets can also be set up for transferable lawsuits with greater ease...
In sum we're talking about the age of the global small business. As long as you're in the service industry, and you don't deal with physical goods, even if a only few of these things happen, life will be interesting.
Ps. Micheal Froomkin disagrees with this. How for example will you escape
having your house seized, how will you convince a large institution like
his university to pay you as a longterm contractor...?
I may be unrealistic, but judging from what is happening to university funding in this country, the increased number of for-credit university courses done by video or TV (Carleton U does 'em), the increased demand for knowledge workers and the increase in small specialty colleges, I'd
say he might dean of the  online law school sooner than he thinks. And as for his house, getting "payment" from your "employer"
(trust fund/company) only for your expenses is already quite possible and (so it's been said around here) seemingly legal (IANAL!) He might even rent it from some odd offshore real estate company (himself).
The only difference compared to now is that it might eventually become alot Thinking of setting up your own universities, folks?

Presumably, once a decent profit model evolves for net publishing, there will be some incentive for customers to give you their opinions, and for others to gather them. Do you have a clear path of trust (or faith or some other quality) proceeding either to them or to their stated customers? I forsee many variations of trust webs to determine the quality of

that may have come near whatever surveillance there may have been).
Why bother with courts and trials? I still think assassination politics is self-terminating.
Don't you mean supply? Stores and physical companies are easier to target
than consumers. But the only remaining environmentalists or for that
matter any other people with strong views will be net-based pseudonyms.
Usenet flamewars, editorials and talk shows just don't seem dying for, imho.

As was recently demonstrated by the passage of a "designer drug law" whose
main purpose was to increase jail time for pot, which nobody in Canada had
asked for and was widely opposed, when the US wants Canada to pass a law,
Canada passes that law. If Washington gives us GAK, it's little brother
Ottawa won't be too far behind.

Speaking of which, could someone tell me who Canada's standards body and rep to the ISO is (and if that's where I've gotta go to get my hands on X.509
and all those other X.docs.). Any addresses would be helpful too.

@_subject: [crypto] crypto-protocols for trading card games 
I'd been thinking about it from the opposite point of view: make up a card
game (possibly electronic, like what you're proposing) that acts as intro
to crypto for the untamed hordes of game players. As you noticed, Simon, cardgames are a good analogue for cryptography.
They operate on the principle of secrecy/discovery (turning over the
cards), there are analogues for all sorts of algorithms (rules of the
game), we have randomness (shuffling), concepts of authentication (to beat
cheaters, no cards up the sleaves, no color-laser-photocopied Magic
cards...), tokens and smartcards (the cards themselves), integer numbers,
and a whole host of special characters a la Alice, Bob, Trent, etc.
(Kings, Queens, Jacks, Jokers). In short, all the building blocks for
working crypto protocols and their interfaces, needing no introduction for
most people. I can sort of even see a representation of a public card scheme
with signatures and certs (I'll have to go grab a deck and try).
Presumably, given a careful choice rules one could do for crypto what
Solitaire did for Windows 3.1 . I see no reason why a card game could not
be an interface for pgp or remailers, or an easier demonstration for
DC-nets, blinding or complicated market protocols. One might even build a
programming language out of such building blocks (probably for scripting).
Poker for Java--Do not Export! (If the CJR for the RSA-Perl T-shirt was
absurd wait till the authorities get stuck with this one.) (Mind you, I probably wouldn't use an imperative language like Java for the scripting, but that's just me.)
This is of course all idle speculation, 'cause I'm lazy and have neither the time nor the expertise. It's all yours folks.

Doesn't the doctrine of limited powers mean that they cannot do what is not
specified? (If I'm not mistaken, IANAL, etc...)
And the ITARs are only executive orders, no? Not laws, right? I'm curious as to why they're considered valid. Anyone know?

@_subject: Where to write crypto? 
Why go so far, when you can export crypto from Anguila or Canada. The first is right next to Florida and is a tax haven, the second has a large talent pool and the same qulity telecom as the States. The main problem is concealing the fact that there may be any Americans involved. Both save you the trouble of learning Chinese.
