Hi There,
this is an appeal
for help
WE are looking for someone to help us set up a remote
web server outside our network (internationally or therwise)
to experiment with running a web server through port 25 (SMTP) or port 110 (POP3). If you have the abilty to help us with this experiment it would be appreciated.
Contact us.
Any other comments appreciable too.
