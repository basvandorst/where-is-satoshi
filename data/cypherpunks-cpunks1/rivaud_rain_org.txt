@_subject: WHERE did this come from? 
Attatched to this is, (I hope), the header text from a unsolicited e-mail message I received.  The return address does not work.  WHY? How can I inform the sender that I hope to never receive there material again?
I tried "reply-all" through Eudora, but my reply got bounced back to me as undeliverable.
I have removed the content of the original message. I don't know why it was sent to me, but it contained material that I found offensive.
Any help, or words of wisdom and enlightenment would be appreciated. Information would be nice too.  -------------header should be below here-------------- i hope...--------

OK, I screwed up.  Sorry to take up all the space with the text of it.
But, whether you agree with it or not, if you know from whence it came and how they sent it, I would like to know.  Thanks again.
