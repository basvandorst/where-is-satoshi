I heard a while back about being able to "split" up a PGP key.  What splitting up the key into many parts, and giving them out to multiple agencies.  ie: One piece goes to the FBI, one to the NSA, one to some other committee, and
so on.  That way, no goverment body could just tap your conversations without getting
approval from others, and gaining the pieces of your key.
just a thought

Stop posting this type of crap on the Internet.  People like you are the ones to get everyone censored.
Hopefully everyone else will flame you a thousand times over

A long time ago, I read about a program that would take a picture, and replace the LSB of every pixel
in the picture with your message.  I'm wondering, Is the source code for this program availible anywhere
on the net???

What if we set up a chaining remailing system in as many countries as possible, all working in double blind
mode.  You could have it randomly pick 20 or so remailers before actually sending the message to its destination.
That isn't a very clean method, but would sure slow down the process of obtaining court orders in each respective country.
I have this other idea, but it would be difficult to set up.  Again, with many many remailers, you could set it up, so that any message you send is sent to a random FTP site of the day.  Each of the remailers randomly picks messages out
of the pool at the FTP site, and sends it on its way (all is encrypted of course).  At the end of the day, the FTP site is erased, and  a new one is set up somewhere else (all remailers would then scan there).
The beauty is that when a remailer pulls a message out of the FTP site, it has no idea where the message came from, nor which
remailer (country) sent it there (providing the pooled messages have had the return addresses removed).  This would make it very difficult to track down to the source.
The disadvantage is that it requires cooperation between remailers, and that a message cannot be replied to.
Anyway, just my $0.02

Hi, lately we have had numerous threads on the CO$, and its threats to remailers, and the such, I am quite interested in the discussions regarding the cult, and want to know if anyone out there knows of a mailing list that deals with it that I can join.

@_subject: mailing-list through a remailer 
Does anyone know if the following would work:
Having a mailing-list run through a remailer??
Someone would post (through an anon remailer) about a majordomo type list through an anonymous remailer (anon-penet.fi for example).  You would send a message to 123456 at anon-penet.fi, with a subscribe SECRET-LIST.  Your message would be anonymous to the list, as the server would be to you.  The server would then treat your return address through the remailer as your address, and you would post to the anonymous account for the server.
It would be double blind, and difficult to find out who ran the list.  If you chained the remailers, it would be even more difficult.
Can this be done??
Has this been tried??

@_subject: Fingerprinting annoyance 
With regards to filling in your own card, what about using a disappearing ink?? Then your prints would disappear! You could even do your name, right infront of them, and it would disappear, leaving these anynonomous prints behind!!
Or you could make an inkpad that is damp with sodium hydroxide (lye) instead of ink.  That way, you could lightly roll your fingers in it, like it was ink, and then wait a minute, and wipe it off.  That way, the only skin being eaten away, would be the ridges of the fingerprints.  Do this enought times, and the rigdes will end up the same height as the valleys, and will then essentially be flat.
Just a thought, but I'd like to hear if anyone would think either ideas would work.

Huh? 'a rather strong tradition of protection of individual privacy'? In Sweden, for many years  you could (and for all I know, still) go to a records office and look up all kinds of personal data on anyone, without
restriction - you could, for example, find out your co-workers exact salaries if you were curious.
   My understanding is that Sweden's postion vis-a-vis the Internet has
been particularly clueless, with international email technically a crime,
and government officials who regard modems as criminal tools.
   I hope things have improved.
