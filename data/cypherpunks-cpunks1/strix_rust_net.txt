@_subject: SOUP KITCHENS -- lifespans 
In case Alan's post didn't make it clear, _average_ lifespan values are
averages from birth.  Maximum lifespans haven't changed.  However, between
the effects of vaccination and municipal sewage treatment, any infant born
in a developed country has a good chance of living a long time.  A society
with very high birth rates and high infant mortality will have a low
average lifespan even if every child who makes it to the age of ten lives
to be a hundred. `=-`=-`=-`=-                                          -='-='-='-='

@_subject: KIDNEYS STOLEN FROM A NAKED DRUGGED MAN 
One might (I'm not a surgeon) be able to get viable kidneys under the
circumstances mentioned, but the victim wouldn't wake up.  This has all the
hallmarks of a good urban legend.

@_subject: Oil Change software snoops through hard drive 
I thought Alan was implying that Oil Change might be licensed by other
software vendors, and then supplied as a "service" without warnings.
For instance, one might purchase the NiftyKeen Win95 graphics editor, and find in a footnote on page 58 of the manual that the product will
automatically update itself unless the user explicitly refuses the Customer Convenience Package during installation.
In any case, I don't think it's a bad idea to point out the potential
problems -- some people just don't notice these things unless the
implications are spelled out in at least as much detail as the glowing
marketer fluff.

@_subject: Dr. Vulis is a test, right? [was RE: Desubscribe] 
There is somebody by this name in the field: the City University of New
York granted a PhD to one Dimitri Vulis in 1995.  The dissertation title
was "Collective encryption: Cryptosystems based on the commutator
collection process for certain free products".  As to whether the
existence of someone with any given name has any bearing on the identity
of any participant in cypherpunks, well, this list has discussed that
general topic before... `=-`=-`=-`=-                                          -='-='-='-='
