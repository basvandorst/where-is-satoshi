@_subject: How email encryption should work 
According to James:
Are you saying that the keyserver creates the
public-private key pair for the user?
That doesn't sound like a good idea.
How do you prevent that a user creates a key/certificate
for an email address the user doesn't own.
Unless you use certificates issued by a trusted-third party,
that's not secure.
