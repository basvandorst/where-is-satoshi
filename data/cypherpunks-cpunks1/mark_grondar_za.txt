Hmm. Not only is this law unenforceable, it is unenforced. Anyone,
non-US or otherwise can buy crypto books - you just can't get the code
on floppy. Bruce Schneier went through this procedure when he CJ'ed
"Applied Cryptography".
The illegal bit about (for instance) the munitions T-shirt is that it
has a bar code. _This_ makes it illegal for export, because not only is
it machine washable, it is machine readable.
Academic exchange of mathematical knowledge has never been under scrutiny.
"Technical data" will have to be interpreted to mean somethiing different,

Point is, it got CJ'ed, and easily too. In fact I understand that the
process was 'trivial'. Just the software on floppy was a problem.

@_subject: /dev/random for FreeBSD [was: Re: /dev/random for Linux] 
A colleague drew my attention to this, and I was so pleased with it that
I ported it to FreeBSD.
I kept the interface as close to the original as I could, but made some
changes for efficiency and ease:
1) I turned the huge comment at the top explaining the theory of operation
into a man page (random(4)).
2) We felt that hooking all interrupts might be dangerous. IDE drives can
interrupt at a heck of a rate, and so can some serial ports, and we felt
that in these cases _not_ using the interrupt was a good idea. So I
added an ioctl to allow the superuser to select his own set, appropriate
to the hardware in use. It is nearly impossible to do this automatically.
Gimme a yell if you want copies :-)

Version 0.92 21st Sept 1995.
Something I didn't mention earlier; we felt that letting the unwashed
masses read /dev/*random was not a good idea, as they could deplete
the pool of entropy all to easily for attack purposes. For the same
(or similar) reason, giving the said unwashed masses _write_ privelige
might allow them to set /dev/*random to a known state. You've probably
already thought of this, but I just had to say it :-).
(Hmm.. Thinks of ways of doing something similar. I'm not functioning too
well right now.)
Are you sure about this? The stochastisity if this would be pretty
hefty. Not only would our attacker have to get the _time_ that the
interrupt occurred (if it interrupted our machine), he would then have
to process in brute-force mode all possible times in his error range.
What is more, more interrupts are coming in...
Hokay! Please also send me _your_ latest. (BTW - did Linus put it in
his latest kernel?)

Is not in the kernel, this is just the permissions on /dev/*random.
Hmm. Lemme think about this...
How about SetGID? We were going for 660 root.kmem.
Ponder... I'll put this forward.
What happens if some attacker does:
for (;;) {
? "Gut feel" suggests to me that large ammounts of "predicted" input might
be worse than the normal sort of system noise you have been using.
Clue me in - I'm not quite with you? :-)
Is this millisecond accuracy quantifiable in terms of bits of entropy?
if so, the ethernet is surely safe?
Again, if you can quantify the number of possibilities into bits of entropy,
your code is good. Depending on current technology, this may have to change.

Fooey. Of course. Scratch that plan.
I chatted with a colleague at work, and he helped bend my mind right.
I had the mistaken notion that adding lots of data would "overflow"
and "dilute" the entropy to an attackable state.
In a 386 or a 486 (under FreeBSD at least) there is a 1Mhz clock available.
How would _this_ be? On the Pentium there is the  register
which will give the board's oscillator (or 90 MHz) I believe.
Ah yes - _that_ register. :-)
What then is a body to do? Preserve all _verifiable_ randomness like gold?
Dish it out under some quota? A denial of service attack would be

Severely limiting most decent folk's chance at getting PGP to work.
Right now I am considering making a piece of cheap hardware to deliver
noise to a digital input. (Electronics is a stagnant hobby of mine)
Interested? I may knock up a prototype in a month or so...
Can they predict thermal noise in a cheap transistor? ]:->
This is a strong argument for some form of specialised noise source.
I have read of methods of getting this from turbulent air flow in a hard
drive (an RFC, I believe).
If I was running Fort Knox, I'd probably use Radioactive decay...

There are two interrupts 100Hz and the other 128Hz (The second gets pushed
into the +-1K region during profiling.
Drat. Methinks I need to follow suit, but I value that 1Mhz...
True. VMS could probably do this. Getting there (I think).
True. Good policing never hurt.
The idea that I like the most so far is to generate noise, but filter
it through an LPF to get frequencies less than (say) 500Khz. Put that
through schmitt trigger to get decent squarewaves and then into an
N-bit hardware shift register with some XOR feedbacks to mix this.
Voila! Nice numbers on demand. Shouldn't cost more than a few ...
Doesn't work on servers in locked rooms... :-(
With those, as long as the machines are secure, (ie plebs cannot watch
and time raw packets) the network card is OK. The server may not be on
transit ethernet AT ALL.

Ideally, yes. However most processes won't swamp (and deplete) /dev/random
like this will. Most (well-behaved) processes will (should) just take what
they need. The above loop tries quite hard to take all that is there,
so any process asking for randomness will be sharing with the above loop
on an almost byte-by-byte basis, like you suggest.
The above won't leave a "pool of randomness" to act as a buffer for user
requests, so will cause a nasty slowdown.
