Postal Service Eyes .us Domain
12:30 pm PDT 19 Jun 98 The post office is circulating a draft laying out
its case for taking over the United States' official top-level Internet
domain as a means of accelerating ecommerce.
The 8 May proposal outlines four goals the postal service would pursue if
granted authority over the domain by Jon Postel, who heads up the numbers
authority and administers the .us domain. The service said it is already
working with Postel's group to map .us domain space against its postal
address database. Postal service spokeswoman Sue Brennan said the proposal was developed at
the urging of the White House. "The administration requested that we investigate the policy of a .us
domain, just to investigate what would be involved," Brennan said. "The
majority of the other countries have their own country domain ... managed
by the government, so the Commerce Department was investigating the
possibilities [of doing the same in the United States]." According to the proposal submitted to the institute, the postal service
would "engage the private sector in the development of credentialed,
commerce-enabling space under .us [and] promote classified business
addressing under .us at local, state, and national levels as an open
reference for public and private delivery systems and competing directory
services." The proposal also said the postal service would "manage an open policy
process to develop policies for expanding the .us domain... [and] work
toward the establishment of a governance structure that will represent the
diversity of stakeholder interests -- private, nonprofit, and public -- in
a fully developed .us domain space James Glave, News Editor, Wired News,   (415) 276-8430

SF Blackout: Y2K Dress Rehearsal
by Chris Oakes and Craig Bicknell , Wired News
12:40 p.m.  8.Dec.98.PST
When the lights went out Tuesday on nearly 1 million San Francisco Bay Area
residents, the blackout served as a warning of what might happen in a
society dependent upon electricity for basic services and commerce.
"This could very well be a reflection of a Y2K disaster that's not properly
managed," said Nancy Wong, a spokeswoman for the US Critical Infrastructure
Assurance Office. "It's another reminder of how tremendously dependent everyone is on power,"
added Peter Neumann, a critical infrastructure expert and the author of the
book Computer Related Risks. "It's kind of a harbinger of the Year 2000 problem. We're in practice mode
right now." James Glave, News Editor, Wired News,   +1 (415) 276-8430

Lycos Acquires Wired Digital 6:00 a.m.  6.Oct.98.PDT
In a move that continues the trend of consolidation in the Internet
industry, Web search and community firm Lycos has acquired Wired Digital,
the parent company of Wired News, for approximately US$83 million in Lycos
stock. Lycos said in a statement that the combined traffic of both
companies will allow Lycos, already the second most visited Web index
service, to reach more than 40 percent of Web users. Tuesday's acquisition coincides with the introduction of "The Lycos
Network," a collection of service, news, and community sites that now
includes Wired Digital properties Wired News, the HotBot search engine, and
the Webmonkey developer site, in addition to existing Lycos sites
Lycos.com, WhoWhere, Tripod, and others. According to Relevant Knowledge, Wired Digital attracts nearly five million
unique visitors a month. The acquisition is scheduled to close by the end of the calendar year and
is subject to Wired shareholder approval. Lycos (LCOS) will also assume
Wired Digital's stock option plan. Under the deal, Wired Digital will continue to operate from its San
Francisco, California, office as a business unit of Lycos, and Beth
Vanderslice, president of Wired Digital, will report to Lycos CEO Bob Davis. The Wired Digital brands will remain distinct operating units of Lycos,
which Lycos said would allow the company to reach multiple Web audience
segments. For example, Lycos said in a statement that Wired Digital's HotBot search
engine attracts a "tech-savvy Web veteran," while Lycos.com serves a
broader audience. According to Media Metrix, the two search engines attract
distinct audiences, with only 20 percent overlap between the two. The Lycos Network and Wired Digital have already taken steps to share each
other's content and services. Wired News is available on the headline page
of Lycos.com, while Lycos' Angelfire home pages and MailCity e-mail
applications are now being offered to HotBot users. Lycos search offers links to HotBot and other Wired Digital properties
through top keyword searches. Further, Webmonkey's Web developer tutorials
and resources will be available to Tripod and Lycos.com homepage communities. In May of this year, Wired Ventures, the former parent company of Wired
Digital, sold Wired magazine to Advance Magazine Publishers. Copyright ï¿½ 1994-98 Wired Digital Inc. All rights reserved.
