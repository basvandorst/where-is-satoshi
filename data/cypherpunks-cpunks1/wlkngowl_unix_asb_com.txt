@_subject: ANNOUNCE: NOISE.SYS random sampling device for DOS v0.2Beta 
Re: NOISE.SYS Random Sampling Device Driver for DOS (v0.2-Beta):
I've finally gotten a usable version of NOISE.SYS written.  The beta
is ready for semi-public release and review.  If you're interested in
testing it or examing the code, email me at It's only a prototype version.  I do not know any strong methods of
testing random data.  If anyone is willing to help on that part or
point me in the right direction, it would be appreciated...
What this driver does:
When loaded, it hooks onto the keyboard interrupt (0x09) and collected
fast timings between keystrokes.  It can also be easily configured at
compilation to sample other interrupts, as well as collect "seedling"
keystrokes upon initialization.
It sets up a character device called RANDOM, that when polled takes
the earliest collected bytes from the random pool (size can be adjusted),
combines them with a count-word based on the number of samples collected
plus the number of times the driver has fetched data from the pool,
transforms it using the Secure Hash algorithm, and outputs the bits from
the hash.
It's only a prototype: this version doesn't check to see if the pool is
"empty" at the moment.
Features: written in 386 assembler, takes under 2k of memory and can be
loaded from the command line using a utility like DEVLOD.  Also under
GPL, so you've got the source-code to play with.
Comments and criticism from crypto-gurus would be greatly appreciated.

I'm working on a random noise sampling device for DOS, and so far have
a prototype version that samples the keyboard timings.  I'm unsure of
a good way to implement it...
Device timings (and in the future periodic samplings of the mouse
position or sound-card noise input) are put into a ring-buffer of raw
data and the output is a straight secure hash of it...  (when the
output buffer is used it, it just rehashes the data in the buffer at
the moment...)
I'm looking for some advice on how to determine when the raw data has
been "used up" and worth processing/encrypting before re-hashing it...
This in mind, offers for eventual beta-testers (annnouncement will
follow when it's ready), or suggestions for features (what to sample,
device interfaces) would be helpful.

@_subject: Video retraces as a source of entropy... 
Quickie blurb on using video card retraces as a source of entropy...
I've done some brief testing in the last couple of days on using the timing drift between video retrace events as a source of randomness.
It seems comparable to truerand() spinners that check the system's timer ticks [which makes me leary of relying on it since it
has similar strange attractors when plotted in a noise sphere, but
that's another post...].
Assuming one trusts truerand spinners, this method could have some advantages over a 'pure software' method, since the video controller
(and other hardware controllers which could be adapted to this) runs in 'parallel' [although it's liable to the samefluctuations in current or memory-access and other interfaces with the main system, or possibly tempest attacks for the paranoid...].
In pseudo-C:
int retrace(void) { // test for video retrace
 __MSDOS__
  return (port[0x3da] & 8); // Some VGA, maybe EGA cards
  // your OS here
  [..]
   x = 0;
  while (!retrace()) x++;
I've tested it as  standalone routines (in Pascal and assembler)  as well as
a hook to the DOS idle in the background [See note about strange
atteactors above].  It also seems to work while in Windows (but not
OS/2?!), which is an advantage over using the system's microsecond
timer alarm (which Win3 takes over).
Comments? (other than "truerand is an oxymoron"....)

@_subject: RNG_DEVICE Environment Variable? 
Considering a couple of RNG hardware manufacturers use different names for device interfaces, perhaps it would be 'convenient' to have apps look for the environment variable RNG_DEVICE which gives the name of whatever device is used (rnadom$, random, rand, even lpt2...) or even a special file that is mixed periodically by a cron job (noiz.c?).
The assumption is that reads from that device would return "truly random" bytes (not from a pseudo-RNG), either from specialized hardware or a system-noise sampler such as noise.sys (DOS) or random.c (Linux, FreeBSD).
How software would handle not getting enough bytes is another matter, perhaps left configurable to the app.

This comes from the FTC Privacy List, and is somewhat relevant....
(The the "Crypto" in the title isn't, oddly...).
Some thoughts... (er, questions):
1. What are the implications for log-on systems that rely on recognition of faces (supposedly impossible for hackers to describe and exploit)?
2. Legal implications for witnesses?
------- Forwarded Message Follows -------
                 "Crypto-ID" Cards Not Effective
     Recent studies into the effectiveness of photo credit cards
have cast doubt over their ability to cut fraud.  Dr. Richard
Kemp, of the Department of Psychology at Westminster University,
London, organized an experiment involving a London supermarket to
test the cards in "the real world."
     The supermarket was staffed by six people who were all
warned to be on the look out for fraudulent credit cards.  Dr.
Kemp arranged for 44 of his students to pose as shoppers and test
the staffs' ability to spot photo-card misuse.  Each student was
armed with four cards.  One showed the student as they were, one
showed the student wearing make-up, one showed an individual who
vaguely resembled the student and the last card depicted someone
who looked nothing like the bearer.
     People usually recognize photographs of individuals based on
a familiarity of the subject.  A photograph captures only one
angle and expression out of thousands of different combinations. People will recognize photographs of family, friends and well
known individuals easily.  But how easy is it to accurately
compare a photograph with the face of a perfect stranger?  At a
recent conference, Dr. Kemp said that matching a photo to a
stranger's face was "too difficult."  He also said that in a non-
experimental situation, such as a supermarket, the incidence of
fraud detection would be even lower.
     The results of Dr. Kemp's supermarket experiment proved very
interesting.  In all, the majority of fraudulent cards were
accepted.  Amazingly, 35 per cent of the cards bearing a
photograph of someone completely different from the student were
accepted.  A massive 64 per cent of cards bearing a similar
individual were also accepted.  Another factor which seems to
further prove Dr. Kemp's point is that 14 per cent of cards
bearing a true likeness of the student were rejected.
     A few British banks are already offering customers the
opportunity to have their photograph etched onto their cards. They claim a reduction in fraud has resulted from this.  Dr.
Kemp's findings would seem to contradict this belief.  Dr. Nicky
Towell, one of Dr. Kemp's researchers, said "There is a widely
held assumption that photo credit cards are a cheap and effective
way of stopping fraud.  But this is not the case."
     No one can tell how well photo credit cards will catch on. But with the majority of people carrying at least one, if not
more cards of some sort, how long will it be before photos become
compulsory?  The government knows that the introduction of ID
cards is a political hot potato, but how many people would notice
if they turned the cards we already have into crypto-ID cards?

Hm. I didn't see that post... (I wonder if he plotted an ASCII

A lot of bad PRNGs look good with noise spheres.... but what I found while experimenting with them was data based on timer drift samplings that passed a variety of randomness tests but showed up with very clear patterns on a noise sphere... so I made the original post to the list and sci.crypt about it.
Noise spheres will show certain correlations in the data.  It doesn't mean that the RNG is crypto-usable if it looks good. But if it looks bad then you know to be suspicious.... a visual image makes a clear point better than analyzing a lot of numbers on a page.
By no means should it be relied upon as a sole test.
If you see definite spirals and loops then it's more than random It doesn't pass or reject anything. It plots data. If the data shows *definite* patterns, you can reject the RNG.  If not, use more sophisticated tests.
That's probably what the poster to c'punks wrote about...

@_subject: A better entropy estimation method for random.c/noise.sys? 
I've been hacking with the hashing method used in noise.sys and decided to throw it away, since it did more to overestimate the Until I find something better an xor-checksum of the ast N samples seems to do fine. Alternating samples generate no entropy and samples with periods <= N seem to generate less than 1 bit per sample.
The method (in pseudo-code) is as follows:
  delta = abs( LastSample - sample )
  LastSample = sample
  hash ^= delta  /* until I can think of a better hashing algorithm */
  swap delta, lastNtable[ indexNtable ]
  indexNtable = (indexNtable+1) mod N
  hash ^= delta
  t = counter /* counts the number of samples so far */
  counter++
  swap t, lastseen[ hash & (TABLESIZE-1) ]
  diff = lastseen[ hash & (TABLESIZE-1) ] - t
  if diff<=N, assume no entropy (or fractional entropy?)
  otherwise return log2(diff)

Wait a minute: RC4 is an OFB cipher.  The previous plaintext has no effect on the ciphertext.  Hence, an attacker with shitloads of storage capacity can generate some initial output for each key and test each pre-stored key against ciphertext for possible hits.  Using 'flaws' in the key schedule (esp. if the key is based on a password rather than a hash of a password) one could search for 'more likely keys' first.

@_subject: More evidence that democracy is bunk 
And some people think polls are an accurate representation of anything.  Chances are it's really a poll of people with telephones who just finished watching news reports about increased threats of terrorism.  Depends on the exact questions that were asked of them, Note that 'more power to investigate terrorists' is vague.  Very vague, especially if the actual question was "should the federal government be given a greater ability to investigate terrorists?" (which is not the same as 'more power'... greater ability could be more funds or manpower, for instance.)
Often time pollsters will introduce the question with a short paragraph or statistics explaining the situation... often these will cue someone in to be more likely to answer a certain way.  If the pollster says "with the increase in terrorist activisties in the United States and new communications technologies, should the federal government..." a respondant will be more likely to agree that the gov't should have more power.
That's vague too. What was the question: "...even if it meant a charity that was exploited by a terrorist group was investigated" or a "political group which a suspected terrorist belonged too" etc.?
If they were asked if they minded random searches of their bags and belongings or required to carry photo-ID wherever they went, to be presented on demand, would they still be willing?

security.  Keeping the BBS on an encrypted partition also helps.

Another idea might be to stego the accounting info (real info ;) inside one of pictures using a similar method.... in some ways this method is better suited for stego since it becomes lunacy for the cops to insist that every picture or audiofile  you have has something or many things hidden... (unless they've been watching you and know you keep accessing your jodi foster pix after a client visits you...)

@_subject: Electronic Grille Cipher? 
An idea occurred to me the other day, for hiding multiple
texts in one file using multiple keys.  The gist of it is to
take a reasonably large file of random data and then to hide
the bytes of a message in scattered locations.  The method of
determining where each byte is would be based on a good cipher
which for each iteration would return a relative offset from
the last location in the file.
It's the electronic form of those ciphers where you have a
message in a grid, the key being random holes punched in a
card and the rest of the boxes filled with junk... I think it's
called a Grille Cipher, right?
If the file is reasonably large and the messages reasonably
small, then multiple messages with multiple keys can be hidden
in the same file.  Thus one passphrase can decrypt an innocuous
message while another decrypts the real message. (Some care
should be taken to make sure there are no collisions.)
If an unencrypted plaintext was intermixed in a "truly random"
file this way, it would be difficult for an attacker to extract
it (though it's nicer to intermix an encrypted file...).
This method could also be applied to stego when hiding a file
in graphics or sound files since an attacker who suspects a
stegoed file would have trouble detecting a PGP header.
Any comments? Has this been thought of before?

I'm not familiar with SSL protocols, but something that would anonymize web page access and keep it entirely encrypted (not just credit card or forms transactions) would be good.
Encrypted/truly anonymous ftp would be nice (though some folx would understandably have problems with truly anonymous uploads, and crypto export restrictions in the US could be problematic legally).
I think there is already work on encrypted telnet (stel) by the CERT/IT On the non-net side of things, implementing encrypted BBS/communications and file-transfers is useful.  I'm told PGP-Phone is supposed to support encrypted communications/file-transfers... so a host-script language that enables a simple BBS would be nice.
Implementing encrypted/anonymous mailing lists is another idea.

@_subject: [noise] the individual and the tribe 
I originally said:
Beware of stereotypes about "tribal culture".  The individualism in a
tribal culture is different than in western society.  In some ways the west
is way more collectivist than tribal societies... taxes, public works,
laws... even the bare minimums that would exist in libertarian societies.
Certain forms of self-expression and practices with regards to sexuality,
drug use, etc. are quite acceptable in some tribal cultures... even
encouraged over western conformism.
The use of myths with regards to nationalism and cultural purpose is actually a western phenomenon.  Creation myths, "how we got here" etc. stories have different functions in tribal socieities, and are not used as a rationalization of collectivism or submission to the will of the tribe.
Decision making in tribal cultures generally is often based on group consesus... if no consensus is reached, no decision is made.  Disagreement is acceptable, and in some cultures also encouraged as a sign of adulthood. In western collectivist societies there is decision by manufactured consent of the majority in an air of perpetual crisis.... a tyranny of the majority.
Tribes aren't run by chiefs or sorcerers.  Large industrial nations are.

Ever wonder that a random number device driver or hardware will have a subtle Relying on the /dev/random NOISE.SYS driver now while it's still in beta isn't nec. a good idea.  For experimentation, sure.  I'm also rather
concerned as to how this version of PGP handles it.  Very much so.
The current and latter versions of NOISE.SYS parallels the Linux random.c driver in that there are two devices, /dev/random and /dev/urandom... the older versions (pre version 0.4) will return as many bytes as are requested (from /dev/random) whereas the current version returns only as many bytes as are conservatively estimated to be "truly random".
If you are using the older NOISE.SYS /dev/random or the newer version's based on SHA rather than real random data.
The implementation should try to get as many bits as are needed from the driver and then request some keystrokes, collect more data, etc. until you have enough bits (advantage over older PGP method? You only need to sample from driver, and not worry about processing raw samples yourself; driver also samples from other sources than keystrokes as well...)
I'd be wary of relying on NOISE.SYS or any similar driver for PGP-key generation until the driver gets more thorough examination; I'd also be VERY wary of an improper use of the driver.

Here's another idea (don't laugh): to set up a system where mailing

Advantage for anonymous mail is that if a remailer is untrustowrthy,
there's still some security in the final remailing of the document.
Furthermore, non-encrypted mail is less at risk of tampering. And some
newsgroups or lists could requires a signed message from an approved

jf_avon at citenet.net (Jean-Francois Avon (JFA Technologies, QC, Canada)) Actually, that is a common distortion of McLuhan.  When McLuhan said
that, he meant that the use of a medium (by "medium" he meant any communicated more than just its content.  What he found interesting was
the effect of a lot of people watching TV, the same channels at the same
time, as being meaningful itself, irregardless of what was on the TV.
He probably would not have been anti-crypto, IMO, and would have found
its widespread usage as signifying something... the cryptomedium would
be a message independent of the encrypted messages.
As for this crapola about privacy concerns being outdated, they are very
much up-to-date.  The traditional public/private distinction has quite a
few philisophical problems, but the concerns are more imporant now than
a hundred or a thousand years ago.
If anything, the crap that Nick pupports is what's outdated... the public
individual in the polis is long dead, in part because of mass media.
Note that traditional/modernist/existential conceptions were Postmodern critiques are anti-identity; anonymous dividualism is a mode
of resistence to the "15-minutes-of-fame" hype.
Recommend you read Foucault's "Subject and Power" and Deleuze's
"Postscript on the societies of control".  [Oh yeah, the Wired people
did a nice spin calling Foucault an alt.sex.bondage neo-Stalinist.

thought crypto to be a good thing.  But it's just like a church to
fingerpuppet dead prophets into spouting the current dogma.  The
Wired people are too busy paying abblutions to McLuhan's shadow on
the cave walls.
Yep. And McLuhan was actually an individualist, in the sense that
tribal societies are individualist.  There's a difference between
communitarianism and community, between socialism and sociability.

"god dammit" and "ods-bodkin" and "bloody" ("odsblood") were really naughty, even legally punishable(?). Note that the latter are quite usable on TV and have been used in congress on C-SPAN quite often while the former are illegal... you can make a very good religious argument for banning blasphemes and allowing words for bodily functions...
c) for a Latin-speaker in Ancient Rome, "feces" = "shit", etc. etc. Some languages do not distinguish a polite word vs. a naughty word for these things (a very important point)

At long last, the U.S. Department of Justice has filed a brief in

Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) that would block implementation and
enforcement of the Communications Decency Act.
As you'll see below, the DoJ, much like Cathleen Cleaver, seems all too
eager to equate "indecency" with "pornography."
Even worse, the DoJ brief apparently cites Marty Rimm's discredited study
about the "pervasiveness" of online pornography as evidence of the urgent
need to outlaw indecent material.
(TIME Magazine used Rimm's study as the basis for it's sensationalistic
"Cyberporn" cover story back in July.  It was later revealed that Rimm was
an undergradute at Carnegie Mellon University when he did the study, and
that his research contained so many methodological flaws that it was all
but worthless.  TIME even printed a retraction of the story.  For more
information, visit According to Ann Beeson, Staff Counsel for the ACLU, "We never thought DOJ
would be dumb enough to cite to the Rimm study, so it wasn't mentioned in
our initial brief!  We expect the judge to rule on the TRO without further
reply from us, so we'll have to wait until the next round (the preliminary
injunction hearing)
before getting in all the info debunking Rimm -- in any event, it is
certain to be *very* embarassing for the government."

Justice Department responds to telecom lawsuit
February 15, 1996
Web posted at: 12:30 p.m. EST
PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania (AP) -- The Justice Department filed its
written response Wednesday to a lawsuit seeking to block the new
computer "indecency" law, saying criminal prosecutions are needed to
stop a huge increase in the availability of pornography.
The government urged a federal judge not to issue a temporary
restraining order against provisions that would make it a crime to send
"indecent" and sexually explicit material to minors over computer
"Individuals undoubtedly have an important interest in being free of
purposeful and direct intrusions on First Amendment freedoms," the brief
said. "But the governmental interests at stake here in controlling
access by minors in indecent sexually explicit materials is compelling."
The American Civil Liberties Union and 19 other groups sought the
temporary ban Feb. 8, the same day President Clinton signed into law the
Telecommunications Act of 1996.
U.S. District Judge Ronald L. Buckwalter said then that he wanted to see
a written response from prosecutors before issuing a ruling.
The law defines indecent as that which, "in context, depicts or
describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary
community standards, sexual or excretory activities or organs."
Opponents say the standard is too broad and would criminalize
information, even in private e-mail, that has educational, artistic and
social value, simply because it relates to sex.
The government said the indecency standard has been upheld as
constitutional in previous cases, and argued that the law's purpose is
to restrict access to widely available pornographic images and
Violators would face up to two years in prison and $250,000 in fines.
A temporary restraining order should only be granted in extraordinary
circumstances and if there are no other legal remedies available to
plaintiffs. Meanwhile, the situation is dire, the government said.
"In the end, plaintiffs cannot dispute that a large and growing amount
of pornography is presently available on-line and easily accessible to
children in the home, far exceeding anything available prior to the
advent of on-line computer services," the government said.

Yet in terms of supply and demand economics, perhaps garbage collectors etc. deserve to be paid more than accountants and salesmen...
This has nothing to do with cypherpunks or himalayan hackers in hot tubs, so back to the usual data trash.

Yes and no. Sometimes states are able to go after then for taxes in terms of money made from non-Indians.  NYS complains about people going to
reservations to buy cheap cigarettes, for instance, and wants taxes
collected from non-Indians.
I think the Iran-Contra flap involved using a reservation in Calif.
to get around some weapons manufacturing or exporting laws. Not sure,
The tribe.  They may not be too happy about an ISP on their territory
carrying porno, neo-nazi literature or even crypto...
Actually, they may look down upon any business deal meant to circumvent
US laws, since it can get them into an unpleasant conflict with the
gov't.  It would be an altogether different situation if they wanted to
start their own ISP though...
Beware of exploiting poor people on Indian reservations or elsewhere
on the planet just to be outside of the laws.  Even if it seems for a
good cause to you, the locals may not look to favorably.
Their own laws may be stricter. Much stricter.
Also, what about the receiver? Or the receiver's ISP?  Erotic materials
are legal in plenty of countries, but can't the receiver get in trouble?
As soon as people see the flawed logic in the Amateur Action BBS case,
that's the take they'll go for... and it's back to square one.

Got this in the mail. Pardon me if it turns out to be spam, but it's relevant.  Pardons to unnamed folx who prefer only crypto stuff.
------- Forwarded Message Follows -------
While I warms my heart to know that the American Family Association thinks
the Communications Decency act is a dud, the following message demonstrates
that the organization does not intend to let the issue rest.
Specifically, they're now seeking to expand the scope of Internet Service
Provider (ISP) liability for "indecent" content. That makes about as much
sense as asking AT&T to censor your telephone conversations, but
regardless... the bottom line is that the American Family Association is
*very* determined to impose its social agenda on cyberspace through
government legislation.
Moreover, at this point it's hardly clear to what extent ISP's are or are
not liable for online content under the CURRENT provisions of the
Communcations Decency Act.  Given this ambiguity, a more stringent
clamp-down would only expand the "chilling effect" on free speech.

COMPUTER PORNOGRAPHY LAW NOT WORKING, SAYS AFA
WASHINGTON, Feb. 14 /PRNewswire/ -- American Family Association issued the
following: "Less than one week after the Communications Decency Act was
signed into law by President Clinton, it is obvious that the law, designed
to curb computer pornography, is not working and never will work," said
Patrick Trueman, director of American Family Association governmental
affairs.  This fact was made clear by the action this week of CompuServe, a
major access provider to the Internet, to restore access to pornographic
Internet sites it had recently blocked under pressure from German
Access providers to the Internet have a financial incentive to provide
access to pornography and they will not block such sites until they are
under a legalobligation to do so, Trueman said.  The Communications Decency
Act included specific provisions protecting access providers from criminal
liability and until those provisions are repealed, CDA will be nearly
useless, he added.
Trueman wrote to leaders of pro-family groups today urging them to unite
behind a tough anti-pornography measure like that sponsored by Congressman
Henry Hyde.  The Hyde measure, which would have made anyone liable who
knowingly and intentionally provides pornography to children or obscene
pornography to anyone, was defeated in committee by supporters of CDA.
"The reality is CDA does not work and it will never work.  For its
enforcement it relies on a massive number of prosecutions by the Justice
Department of individuals who put illegal pornography on the Internet while
the major distributors and money makers from the distribution of
pornography -- the access providers -- are given a free ride," Trueman said
in his letter to pro-family leaders.
Trueman urged pro-family leaders to act now to change the law. "There is no
point in waiting months or years.  CompuServe has made that clear in its
recent actions which demonstrate that the law has little, if any, deterrent
effect," Trueman said in his letter.

Well, maybe something like using the same core algorithm but a very different (and better?) key expansion algorithm, for instance.
But what if someone reverse engineered an algorithm, worked on it a few months, and then published something on the net, with a different key set up routine, and a very similar core algorithm (different for one or two operations, but an improvement) and discussed it in terms of having constructed the algorithm himself.
It has nothing to do with anyone signing non-disclosure agreements, since if the cipher is widely used in popular software, sooner or later someone will reverse engineer it.
And my point is that what if somebody publishes something and offers it in the public domain that is strikingly similar but not the same, with no clear way to tell if it was invented separately or reverse engineered and fudged?
I can imagine a hacker doing that to another trade secret cipher... I can also imagine someone reinventing the same cipher if it's simple That's another problem with trade secrets.

PGP should give a warning when the key passes the expiration date. It
should not prevent you from using it, but should remind you that the
key is rather old, and that the owner may have moved, etc.
Users who want to extend the life of their keys should send special
certificates (at least once a year or every other year?) that tell
keyservers and those with copies of their public keys that the key is
still being used, and to update the expiration time.

The reason I think a warning option is good (really, 1 bit bit flag for warn rather than kill... that's "bulk" to every key?) is so that if for whatever reason the key is used (say I am unable to get a newer key for you but really need to send you a private message) I have something to use... and you, if you choose to hold onto old keys, can decrypt it.  If not, the sender was warned.

@_subject: A /dev/random standard is need. 
I'm revising the DOS NOISE.SYS driver currently.  In writing the
documentation I am discussing the advantages of such a driver (part of
the logic behind writing it).
Mainly, a hardware (and to some extent) operating system independent
means is needed for generating random numbers.  It seems to me that a
device driver (at least for DOS, Unix and maybe Amiga or Atari) is the
best way to do this.  If one has special chips or diodes for
generating randomness, a device driver which reads from them can be
used. If one lacks such equipment, something like NOISE.SYS or
random.c for Linux, or Noiz (which I have not yet look at) can be
Even then, random.c defines two devices, random (which only returns as
many bits as there are fresh bits in the entropy pool) and urandom
(which keeps hashing the bits and will return as many as requested.)
NOISE.SYS defines only random, which behaves more like urandom above.
If there is a standard, it will make it easier to use special hardware
since software which reads from a random device can access it.
Perhaps a kind of standard should be discussed and created so that
cross-platform development is made much easier, and so that features
and capabilities can be worked out.
Does anybody else see a need for this?

Bills Reflect now popular get-tough stance
by Liam Pleven, Albany Bureau
   Albany - A bill that would restrict sexually explicit material on the Internet - which the Assembly took little notice of last year - is suddenly headed tothe governor's desk after winning legislative approval yesterday.

Not much info in the article. It wasn't the central focus... actually, the article dealt with the political cynicism of the new More from the article (all that really mentions the bill at all):
    The cyberspace bill, passed by the Senate last week, could make it   a felony to have sexually explicit communication with a minor through   a computer network, especially if the communication included pictures   of sexual activity or an invitation to have sex.
Which doesn't say much about the bills content.  Technically this is already illegal, so why pass a cybespce-specific bill? What are the responsibilities of publishers, ISPs, SysAdmins, etc.?  What if a minor pretentds not to be a minor?
IMO, It sounds like another meaningless bill that looks good on
political mailings...

GERMAN PROSECUTORS TARGET INTERNET RACIAL HATRED
The Mannheim, Germany, prosecutor's office has launched an investigation of
CompuServe and Deutsche Telekom's T-Online service for inciting racial
hatred, a crime in Germany.  At issue is online access to a Web site run by
a neo-Nazi extremist in Canada who uses the Internet to distribute
anti-Semitic propaganda.  The legal reasoning, according to a prosecutor's
office spokesman, is that "because it's available over the Internet, it also
can be called up in Germany.  Then the scene of the crime is all Germany."
Although the investigation is now limited to CompuServe and T-Online, there
are also several hundred small companies that provide Internet access in
Germany. (Wall Street Journal 26 Jan 96 B2)

Don't leave out an important point ignored by both sides of the debate
all too often (esp. by the "decency" folk): the structure of the 'net
itself (well, sort of).
It's a decentered network (or set of networks) designed to get
information to its addressee.  Data flows through several nodes and
networks until it reaches its destination.  If it can't get through
one path, it goes through the other.
This isn't just for mail but all "packets" that flow on the net: web
pages, file transfers, telnetting, etc. [A good segue to arguing
"security related to privacy can go here...]
Limiting content or access is only superficially impossible.  The
international scope of the 'net makes even agreeing to standards

@_subject: Rambling about "Net and Terrorism" (long, slightly amusing, and 
On  2 Jul 96 at 1:58, snow wrote/quoted:
[It's hard to tell what's a quote and what snow wrote here]
Yep. Terrorism is fear, but *no* target can be 100% protected. Not even military targets, though it can get difficult and expensive for someone to attack a target.  In such cases, terrorists would go for easier targets.
Terrorism is against a larger, vague target such as a nation or corporation or an industry or an ideology.  Instances are against representations of the target.... a military base is attacked because it is a symbol, not because it is strategic.  If said terrorists cannot attack a military base, they'll attack some soldiers on leave at a disco.
The symbolic importance cannot be understanted (though it doesn't mean that strategic targets are safe either).  So to get back to 'net related discussion: differentiate between use of the internet (and phone or mail systems) to plan acts and spread propaganda versus terrorist acts on the internet.  The former implies a need for LEAs to snoop, while the latter implies a need for high-security, crypto, etc.... they are not so compatible.
So let's say Wild Al's Church of Kookology and Jihad of Banality (WACKJOB) is planning a cyber-terrorist act.  They want something symbolic that will demoralize the United Statesers (USers), so that they will pressure the US government to stop it's Promotion of Internation Googoomuck (PIG) in some corner of the world.
It's counter-productive for WACKJOB to stop PIG by destroying the Federal Reserve's computers, paritcular because an economic collapse will keep USers from buying widget fluid from one of their sponsor countries.  WACKJOB would also be unable use counterfeit (or real) yankee greenbacks to support their enterprise... and likely this would have a negative effect on marks, pounds, etc.  Note that any wealthy kooks who couldn't give a damn about WACKJOB or PIG but like to show off their kook-factor among their other wealthy friends by bankrolling WACKJOB would also be adversely affected... and chances are WACKJOB will not bite the hand that helps it.
WACKJOB might want to disrupt communications so that they can perform a non-cyber terrorist act against PIG, but this might prove more difficult because the Management's systems of communication (telephones, email, cellular, courier, face-to-face meetings, etc.) is complex and distributed.  Also, WACKJOB would want the pigsty networks functioning so that the USers will know about the WACKJOBs sacrificed their lives and disrupted downtown traffic in NYC by leaping off buildings and splattering on the pavement.
So other than using the 'net to plan their WACKJOB (so absurd that the NSA gronk who intercepted the traffic had to be taken to the hospital with a hernia from laughing so much), what *symbolic* cyber-terrorist acts could an aspiring WACKJOB plan?
Keep in mind people value human life a little more computer records or property (excepting certain 'libertarian' folk).  WACKJOBs would attack computer systems that would have an immediate affect on USers lives... but not permanent, and ones that would still allow USers to know it was a WACKJOB.  It would have to be something that appeared to affect mainstream USers.
Perhaps interfering with transportation or medical communications that allowed for a mass amount of injury or death in a short, tragic and dramatic burst.  Seems securing these systems would be a priority.
(Question: possibility of two systems of crypto, escrowed for general public and unescrowed for institutional systems which are more controlled, and where LEAs can get some access to because of the institutional nature?)
Lesser chances of being hit by a falling WACKJOB are not the same as no chance of it.
Feh! Maybe the Russians hate the WACKJOBs as much as the USers, but a corrupt or poor gronk in
   O-+>|  ("The country formaerly known as Russia")
sold nerve gas to a WACKJOB... or some WACKJOB stole it.  Why hold them responsible?!?  And what if it was stolen from a USer?  Under that logic, we can go after the company that mined the steel used in the knife that killed Nicole Simpson (probably a few WACKJOBs would agree with that...)
So WACKJOBs make their own nerve gas from common household ingredients like Olestra and NutriSweet.  Then what?
So the WACKJOBs decide that the center of PIGginess conspiracy happens to be in some rural BFE, hiding under the guise of the Fritters County Malitia and Bible Emporium or maybe in the local Federal Bureau of Ice Cream and Prophylactics Building and nuke the small town you just happen to live in.  (Who would have suspected Oklahamo City?)
Many terrorist strieks against Brittain or Israel/Palestine did not occur in major cities.  Many did not occur in those countries, but on airlines or cruise ships, or in other countries where the targets If you are a USer, you are a target for a WACKJOB.  Doesn't matter if you're in NYC or London or the middle of nowhere or taking an airplane from a WACKJOB-sympathizing country.  Doesn't even matter if you're a WACKJOB sympathizer.
Why only mideast groups?  Why should *they* be the only terrorists? With the 'net, any group with a bone to pick can, in theory, go after bigger cyber-targets (in theory, anyway).
And why nuking? One can understand up-and-coming-regional powers such as Iran or Iraq, Pakistan, trying to get stolen nukes, but not likely for Not saying that no terrorist group would use nukes... but even a lot of stupid WACKJOBs know that nuking a major (or minor) US city would provoke a fierce response from the US, and probably a lot of other countries that felt equally under threat or wanted to disociate themselves from WACKJOBs.  If a WACKJOB's friends or family felt nuking was too extreme, a WACKJOB becomes a pariah.  Perhaps even the official WACKJOBs disociate themselves from the WACKJOBs who nuked some city...
Terrorists want to demoralize their enemies, not anger them further.
Wrong ones? No. It can be recovered from, though with much inconveniencem for most people.  Trashing a computerized pill-making system so the wrong medications were in the wrong pills would have more effect... but would it demoralize faith in the system?
The 911 system doesn't work.  Officers and firement only go the the wealthy neighborhoods in many cities and plenty of people already complain about it.  WACKJOBs want a terrorist act that would be noticed... contributing to the status quo isn't an act of terrorism.
Many places have backup generators or their own local systems. If you live in a hurricane or earthquake prone area your used to losing your electrcity.  Possibly one could get a utility's computer system to dosconnect thousands of subscribers for not paying bills, which would incite anger against it (though chances are their computer system would do this without any human intervention).
Differentiate between extortion ("give a million dollars to x account or all subscribers are disconnected"), vandalism/prank/K001 d00Z feat, system malfunction/bad programming, and WACKJOBs.
They cannot be lumped together as generic 'terrorism'.
It seems the pro-GAK and police-state forces focus on WACKJOBs when they use the term 'terrorists' (though they may label others as such for effect at times).
What is one trying to accomplish by creating a disturbance?  To lead to a collapse of the nation state? Chances are widespread disturbance will lead to large-scale martial law, which would favor statists.
The focus has been on larger, 'sexier' and 'heroic' acts of terrorism
which are inappropriate to the 'net.  What if the WACKJOBs manage to
infect copies of Windoze 6.0 with a copy of a virus that destroys
PIG-related files?  Or if they vanadalize web pages, ftp- or gopher
sites with (what they perceive as) PIG-related materials?  Or a
WACKJOB cancel-moose roaming Usenet?  It also seems as if GAK-
proposals would be a hinderance to measure to protect against such
Another reason the 'net is a "terrorist threat"... it allows "terrorist" groups to have a voice.  Didn't a recent government paper
cite Zapatista communiques as an example of this?  Anti-terrorist measures are as much (if not mroe) thought 'protection' as they are
property/life protection.
"Terrorism" (as defined by the state) does more to stregthen the state,
by creating a nebulous enemy that the state can put an ugly face on while
seizing control to 'protect' itself.  'Cyberterrorism' is something the state
uses to claim jurisdiction over the cybernetic ether, or by which certain
consultants spread FUD for their own benefit.
Situationist's comments about the "Protection Racket" come to mind No-frills sig.

As far as the government is concerned, "gonna do this" and "may have to do this" is the same, since the "this" is illegal.  There is no dividing line. I suspect that since they (alegedly) had specific targets
planned it leaned closer to the "gonna do this".  From the minimal discussion in the media I have read, it appeared to be another 'revenge for waco and ruby ridge' action rather than a 'defense of civil liberties from a potential totalitarian government' action.

be effective were the government to change into a totalitarian regime.)

Another need is for file/disk-encryption utilities.  I'm not familiar with what's out there for Macs, but for PCs there's SFS and ASPICRYP
for SCSI drives (with no source!) and SFS, SecureDrive and SecureDevice
for HD (or FD).  The latter won't work on Win95. AFAIK, SFS and SecureDrive aren't 100% friendly with Win95 either, though they'll work.
There's a need for something that will work under Win95, WinNT, and/or OS/2 for encrypting partitions.  Aside from a few commercial or shareware apps which use some variant of DES, there's little out there.
(One problem is that DD kits for Win95/NT and OS/2 cost $$$.)

"SHRINK-WRAP" LICENSES OKAYED BY COURT
The validity of the "shrink-wrap" licenses that many software publishers
rely on for copyright protection was bolstered by a recent appellate court
ruling in Chicago.  Last month, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals
reversed a lower court's finding that shrink-wrap agreements were
unenforceable.  Plaintiffs in the case, ProCD vs. Zeidenberg et al., charged
the defendants with distributing the software program via the Internet.  The
defendants had argued that they couldn't be held to the license terms
because they'd had no chance to negotiate or object to parts of the
agreement.  They also said the license agreement should be printed on the
outside of the box, where it could be read before purchasing.  The latest
ruling found this suggestion to be an onerous burden, but did say the box
must have a notice saying there's a licensing agreement inside, and that
buyers should be able to return the software if they don't agree to the
license once they read it.  (Investor's Business Daily 3 Jul 96 A5)

@_subject: Transforming variable- to fixed-length keys 
Hmm. What about the following:
  Use a constant (non-weak) key for a cipher (perhaps the hash of   the passphrase under certain circumstances?)
  For iteration-0, CFB (or some other feedback mode)-encrypt the
  passphrase from the input buffer   to the output buffer (assuming the
  library doesn't require that the plaintext and ciphertext be in the same
  buffer)
  For following iterations, repeatedly CFB-encrypt the buffer,
  using a counter in data bytes.
This method could use hash algorithms in MDC or Luby-Rackoff forms
as well as block ciphers (and perhaps some stream ciphers).
Another method might be to seed a PRNG similar to that used in PGP 2.x with the passphrase, have it stir the bytes a number of times, and then use the output as the key:
  randPoolAddBytes(passphrase, passlen);
  for(i=0;i Here's my initial approach, if anyone has any comments to make on this or knows
Questions: Are you using the previous chaining-variables/hash for each successive chunk?  How do you pad passphrases that are smaller than the minimum input for a hash function?

Some lists require plenty of time to read each day (let alone if I go on a vacation for a few days and want to catch up).  Managing a rating system would double the work if I were to do it by hand-rating the raters, etc.
It's easier to put certain people or subject threads in a twit-list folder and delete the rest by hand rather than put twice that effort into a rating system... chances are most people who quickly tire of maintaining it, let the rating system run on autopilot and then disable it when they realize they missed something really important or interesting.

A double-edged quote, isn't it?
[Tim's sort-of techie comments deleted.]
Who needs high-tech for a surveillance state? I remember several years back a Soviet-history class that put a lot of emphasis on the Czar's totalitarian regime, much of which was already in place when the Bolshviks took power (and one of the reasons they held it).
Irregardless of the literacy rate (which I'm guessing was low anyway), it was apparently common practice in many European countries in the early 19th century (incl. Russia) to have 'black offices' in the post offices that would steam open EVERY piece of mail to be read for intelligence and surveillance purposes.  And back then there was probably a higher proportion of meaningful mail since there was no telephone, radio, or (very little) direct-mail marketing.  Generally such offices were used for political purposes.  Oddly enough the secret police organizations spied heavily on those in power as well: sometimes I wonder if Americal political scandals are (or will ever be) linked to US intelligence agencies listening in one some pol's calls.
This is akin in some ways to building a postal system where there's a
black office in every station.

BIOS was written for real mode... part of the problem. Another is the not-made-here syndrome, and in a sense Linux, OS/2, NT and 95 are different types of operating systems, so a shared BIOS is unfeasible.
It would be nice to develop an encrypted filesystem that could be ported across operating systems for those of us with multiple OS's.
BTW, Linux 2.0 is making a nice step in that direction by adding support for mounting a file (which contains a filesystem), specifically to allow encrypted file systems as well as things like testing out iso9660-fs before buring CD-ROMs, etc.  In theory something similar can be done with Win95/NT and OS/2, but it hasn't been done the proper way (SecureDevice is really a hack in that sense).

Are these really "new" challenges?
You haven't lived in a hurricane prone area and lost your electricity for most of a month, have you?  Many of the generators
are already in place.  The power grid is not centralised, so it's difficult
to take down everything for a long period of time (long enough to be truly detrimental to a lot of people) quickly enough (that would require
some non-informational real-life bombing and warfare).
Is it so easy to take a whole network down?  What about various radio operations (HAMs, Marineband, FM, etc.)?  And don't forget automobiles and roads as last-resort communications.
I'm skeptical of that figure (many institutions maintain several printouts and have contingencies to do things by hand... for no other reason than computers go down without human interference).
Not really. Automobiles and buses rely on very little.  In major disasters there are ways to keep limited air and train traffic You sound as if you have not been in a place hit by natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, major floods, etc.  These cause much more damange to infrastructures as well as human life than any organized action could, save for an all-out physical war.  Life still manages to go on.
Isn't that what FEMA is for?  Do you want FEMA involved with the 'net?  Or would you rather get the DoD, NSA, FBI also involved with "Emergency Management"?!?
Yes... it's called key escrow.
That still implies empowering the state rather than allowing entities (individuals and corporations) to protect themselves.
I'm skeptical of much of the InfoWar hype.
Yes, there are important security issues (data integrity and preservation).  But these also cross over with non-info disaster
I also question whether large corporations and banks have compatible interests with individuals.  It seems entirely possible that measures could be taken to protect the former at the expense of the latter.

Depends on the computers one uses, and who you are computing with. I've heard some horror stories of people using PGP modified to handle 4kbit or 8kbit keys on 286s that waited days to generate keys and hours to sign or decrypt messages.
If you're exchanging messages with people using fast computers, lerger key sizes are practical.  Otherwise you need to take the issue of key-size/speed tradoff seriously.
If very improved factoring methods are discovered, it might not matter.  If a new method of cryptanalysis against IDEA comes out, that might make RSA key-sizes a non-issue.

@_subject: MSoft crypto API's 
They could insist on only signing exportable software, and in theory use that as ITAR-relaxing leverage.
Methinks it's a bad move to only have MS sign software... presumably they won't outright refuse to sign competitors software.  It would be a conflict of interest for them not to... very usable as evidence against MS in an anti-trust suit.  Independent CA's would be better.
IMO, it gives a false sense of sucurity to even require crypto apps to be signed.  A lot of folks would want a developer's kit (probably cost $$$) to get around that requirement... nice loophole, BTW, for those that can afford it.  Or until somebody patches the code to ignore bad signatures of lack of them and releases the patch.
Oh yeah... false sense of security in that if an app is signed, it must be secure.  Will the new Windows wipe all temporary files and the swap file?  Otherwise it makes a CryptoAPI meaningless.
There'll be a problem with PGPlib as well... what if people want to compile their own version?  Assuming MS will even sign it... that will be a quagmire.  It's likely that if strong crypto is not implemented in the MS API (or it is done so in an insecure fashion), hardly anyone will use it.
Why? Assuming there were no export restrictions... if it's signed by MS, people will take it to mean that MS is vouching for it.  If they sign a library that does 'naughty things' or is an incredibly incompetant implementation of an algorithm, it could turn out to be bad PR for them.  (Hm... they could use this as an excuse to read competitor's source code.)
Under that logic, I could do the same to a PGP distribution.  I doubt the state department would look at it that way, or a jury for that matter.  If you want to risk a few years in Federal Prison, go ahead... though chances are crypto-apps seem to make it out of the country anyway...

Paged through a recent (June or July 13) edition of Billboard magazine yesterday.  There was an article about the music industry, the internet, and copyright issues.  Didn't have a chance to read in thoroughly, but it mentioned using digital watermarks which contained info on to who (CC number) and when the material was sold... the
watermarks allgedly could survive if a CD was taped, copied several times
and redigitized.
It's rather interesting for several reasons... imagine if every CD you owned was tagged with a link to your identity.  So imagine getting a used CD or from a garage sale... after several years a pirated edition is floating around the internet...
The anti-piracy scheme is only useful for direct sale to a customer though.  If you buy music anonymously, how is it traced?  This only works for pirating on-demand purchases.
Other issues: what if an eavesdropper steals the music or video? It's tagged with your ID.  If he spreads pirated material, you get in trouble even though it's not nec. your fault (if no secure communications are available, anyway).
If it uses a credit-card number as (part of) an ID, that's pretty bad.  Someone can sniff for CC numbers if they know how it's stored.
The system will have to rely on proprietary tech and security through obscurity.  Even know how watermarks are stored without understanding the math, one must be able to somehow garble the sound without distorting it, but which renders the watermark useless.
That a watermark can survive when the music is converted to analog and then redigitized is interesting... (if it's saved as inaudible tones, what's to prevent one from blurting them out with noise in those frequencies?)
Guess I'll have to hunt down that issue and post useful excerpts from it...in terms of far use, of course. (Or perhaps an alt-vista No-frills sig.

The thought of  blindly being a k00l krypt0 activist and getting some
poor guy in another country thrown in jail doesn't do much to help
democratize that country.
Spam and unsolicited mail aren't the way to go.  Better, more subtle ideas, might be to say 'check out this page' ot 'i've got source code for that on my page at...', which has techie or  even entertainment info
but also has political info (that already happens quite I wonder what web users in places like Singapore thought when they kept running across blacked-out anti-CDA pages...
If one is familiar with the culture, one can even be really subtle and seem to be talking about an unreleated story or even techie or sports but actually be discussing the political situation in that country (look at many Soviet films, some Chinese films, Spanish films under Franco's regime, Cuban films, etc.)
Don't underestimate people's stupidity.  The party loyalists or bootlickers may get away with more naughtiness on the 'net, but those borderline techies who are about due for another month at a re-education camp or loyalty counseling may get screwed. If such countries really valued their techies, then why do they allow them to emmigrate to Western countries?
By filtering out all photographs, which from what I heard the Chinese were contemplating.  Whether is it truly feasible is another matter, of course.  But since when has infeasability prevented anyone from trying it?

My point is that a lot of people in those countries are aware of PGP etc. than make it out to be.  Certainly many activists are.  They focus on the human rights issues at hand, to which PGP etc. may be a tool... but isn't the central focus.
It would be condescending to email to many people in a domain saying "hey, have you heard of PGP?..."  Chances are they'll think it's a strange commercial spam anyway.
The "civilized white man" comment was more of a metaphor.  Change that to "Cypherpunks bring gifts of crypto to the natives" or maybe "Cypherpunks civilized the barbarians with PGP"...
Yep.  But there's a proper way to share knowledge.  You don't want to do it in such a way as to get the person you're sharing it with in trouble (esp. for something like crypto, where you could go to jail or be shot in some jurisdictions).  If that person isn't interested, there's not much you can do... you may end up turning someone off.  If you want someone to listen, and be interested (if they're not already), you have to do it in an appropriate way.
You also have to know what you're talking about: if you're not familiar
with the nitty -gritty of politics in such countries, you'll come off as the "cypherpunk bearing gifts of crypto for the natives"... the politics going on in places like Cuba, China, Iraq, Russia are a bit more complex than what comes off through the media (to some extent no matter where you are and what media you watch).
For example... there are many anti-Castro 'democratic' socialists in Cuba.
If you approach them as if they were anti-Communists you'll be seen as a clueless kook.  Some Chinese I have spoken to are suspicious of the Tiennamen Sq. activists, claiming they were more 'reformists' than true democratizers who were unknown before Tiennamen. Many Iranians will insist Iran is a democratic country where fundamentalists hold a lot of popular power, and that Western tinkering will only strengthen fundamentalists rather than allow a transition to a more moderate party.
I'm not saying any of these are true... they are just examples of how people in the respective territories view their situations differently, and that one can do more harm mistaking the situations in those countries.
One more important issue: people have to trust you.  You can't go into a strange environment and expect trust if you come off as a As for sharing knowledge... share crypto with activists involved with other issues.  If one right, they're likely to use it in ways one hasn't imagined.
Yes, do tell.
No. I don't want to see somebody do something annoying and counterproductive that can get people it's allegedly meant to help in trouble and perhaps make a case for strengthening crypto regulations.

@_subject: Opiated file systems 
Nice in theory. Awful in practice.  Requires code for managing keys, encrypting and decrypting for ea. algorithm be resident in memory.  For some systems (MSDOS), free memory is at a premium... (one of the reasons SecureDrive is popular is because it takes only 2.5k).  It's not worth wasting memory for handling several algorithms when only one is going to be used in most cases.
So much for maintaining code across platforms.
Not worthwhile.  Use a Stacker or JAM driver over the encrypted partition on a PC, for instance.  Keep compression and crypto separate utilities... keeps bugs from one interfering with another and reduces complexity of both drivers; also, if one wants crypto w/out compression or compression w/out crypto, no wasted memory (see above about RAM being at a premium).
Why?  Doesn't necessarily increase security, esp. considering the performance hit (memory... see above, time, key management).
Nothing new there.
A common problem with much crypto these days.
Do you understand how such systems work?!?  Every sector is encrypted in such systems.  That's not even an issue for most encrypted file systems (at least on the PC).
If the algorithm is good, this shouldn't matter.  The only way a person could tell if a sector is unused is if that person was able to mount the partition already.
Now this is getting nutty!!!  Never mind the size, compleixty and amazing slowness of such a driver...  you'd have to have audio or video
files of gigabytes in size to be able to store anything of use.
Why?  The authorities would wonder why you have an 8 Gig JPG on your disk and figure you're using it for stego, or you're crazy, or both, and have you committed.

"This framework will encourage commerce both here and abroad. It is
  similar to the approach other countries are taking, and will permit
  nations to establish an internationally interoperable key management
  infrastructure with rules for access appropriate to each country's
  needs and consistent with law enforcement agreements.  [...]"
With differing rules, I can't see how such a system can work.  What happens when one country wants the keys from the citizen of another who is 'favored' by the other's government? (ie, say the US gov't wants keys that a drug cartel kingpin uses when he chats with the brother of the president of some other country...)
And can one be sure that a country's LEAs request keys because a citizen is involved with 'organized crime', or is really a political activist of the unwanted kind?
What's to prevent cooperation of the FBI with foreign LE's (such as in Russia) with looser search-and-seizure rules?
Who is going to manage such systems? Private corporations in various countries?  Will users have a choice as to which to use?  (It would seem the institutions of some countries are less trustworthy than others for different people around the planet.)  How many people would trust the UN? (ObHumor: I hear in the year 2000 the Olympics will have black helicopter races...)
Global key management, even with universal rules, would seem unworkable.  Managing BILLIONS of keys will involve a lot of complexity, in terms of locating keys, data integrity and preservation, authentication, etc.
Methinks it's time for the administration to inhale... oxygen is good for the brain.
I think the potential of import controls has a bit more hype than the admin makes it out to be.  There's already a lot of strong crypto out there... so how much political strong-arming can the Admin do?
I wonder how the Microsoft C[r]API fits in to this, since it mentions "export of cryptography-ready operating systems".

Note that you'd have to be careful of what you say and do over email in the clear (or encrypted to someone cooperating with an attacker): if you post an excerpt of source code or maybe somehting like Edupage, or if you save mail, there might be reason enough for the attacker to expect to see some of that on your encrypted fs after he's rubber-hosed your key from you.  If he doesn't, and he knows you have a possibility of using the duress-key feature...

There has to be a way to tell the system that the sectors are used when not the drive isn't mounted and the filesystem isn't active.
Having a copy of the driver is enough to arouse suspicion.  If they don't find anything useful in that one partition, they'll assume the second is in use and that you're not giving up the key.  You may very well get accused of maintaining a second system even if you are not and do not have anything incriminating in the one encrypted fs.

                          Snake-Oil Warning Signs
                        Encryption Software to Avoid
                              (Revision 0.1)
Good cryptography is an excellent and necessary tool for almost However, there are a multitude of choices for what products to use. Many good cryptographic products are available, both commercial and free.  However there are also some extremely bad cryptographic products (known in the field as "Snake Oil"), which not only fail do their job of providing security, but are based on, and add to, the many misconceptions and misunderstandings surrounding cryptogra
phy and security.
It is extremely important that users of cryptography actively question the product they are considering using, to insure the security and integrity of their data-- be it personal or business informat
ion.  In order to make a more informed decision, it is necessary to some of the "red flags" to watch out for, and what they mean.
For a variety of reasons, this document is general in scope and does not mention specific products or algorithms as being "good" or "Snake Oil".
Some Common Snake-Oil Warning Signs
The following are some of the "red flags" one should watch for when looking at an encryption product:
The vendor's descrption of the product may contain a lot of
hard-to-follow use of technical terms to describe how the product
works.  If this appears to be confusing nonsesense, it may very well
be (even to someone familiar with the terminology).  Technobabble is good means of confusing a potential user and masking the fact that vendor doesn't understand anything either.
A sign of technobabble is a descrption which drops a lot of technical
terms for how the system works without actually explaining how it
New Type of Cryptography?
Avoid software which uses "proprietary" or "secret" algorithms.
Security through obscurity is not considered a safe means of
protecting your data.  If the vendor does not feel confident that the
method used can withstand years of scrutiny by the academic neither should you.
Beware of specially modified versions of well-known algorithms.  This
may unintentionally weaken the cipher.
The use of a trusted algorithm, along with technical notes explaining
the implementation (if not availablity of the source code for the
product) are a sign of good faith on the part of the vendor that you
can take apart and test the implementation yourself.
Old Ciphers Never Die...
Some vendors will claim their software is "unbreakable".  This is
marketing hype, and a common sign of snake-oil. Avoid any vendor that
makes unrealistic claims.
No algorithm is unbreakable.  Even the best algorithms are breakable
using "brute force" (trying every possible key), but if the key size
is large enough, this is impractical even with vast amounts of
computing power.
Be wary of marketing gimmicks related to "if you can crack our
software" contests.  A snake-oil vendor may claim the system uses a one-time-pad (OTP),
which is theoretically unbreakable.
A OTP system is not an algorithm.  It involves generating a random at least the size of the message and garbling the message with it. When the message is decrypted, the key is destroyed.  Only one is encrypted with a OTP, and it is used only once.  They key is
random: generated using a real random source, such as specialized
hardware, radioctive decay timings, etc., and not from an algorithm cipher.  Anything else is not a one-time-pad.
The vendor may confuse random session keys or initialization vectors
with OTPs.
Algorithm or product XXX is insecure
The "key" and the "password" are often not the same thing.  The "key" generally refers to the actual data used by the cipher algorithm.  The "password" refers to the word or phrase the user types in,
 which the software converts into the key (usually through a process called "hashing" or "key initialization").
The reason this is done is because the characters a user is likely to type in do not cover the full range of possible characters. (Such keys would be more redundant and easier for an attacker to gues
s.)  By hashing a key can be made from an arbitrary password that covers the full range of possible keys.  It also allows one to use longer words, or phrases and whole sentences as a "passphrase", wh
ich is more secure.
Anything that restricts users passwords to something like 10 or 16 or even 32 characters is foolish.  If the actual "password" is the cipher's key (rather than hashing it into a key, as explained abo
ve), avoid it.
Anything that claims to solve the "key management problem" is also
be to avoided.  (Key management is an inherent problem with crypto.)
Convenience is nice, but be wary of anything that sounds too easy
to use.  Avoid anything that lets anyone with your copy of the software to access files, data, etc. without having to use some sort of key
or passphrase.
Avoid anything that doesn't let you generate your own keys (ie,
the vendor sends you a key in the mail).
Avoid anything by a vendor who does not seem to understand the difference between public-key cryptography and private-key cryptography.
Lost keys and passwords
If the software is made in North America, can it be exported?  If the
answer is yes, chances are it's not very strong.  Strong cryptography
is considered munitions in terms of export from the United States, requires approval from the State Department.  Chances are if the software is exportable, the algorithm is weak or it is crackable (hence it was approved for export).
If the vendor is unaware of export restrictions, avoid the software:
the vendor is not familiar with the state of the art.
Because of export restrictions, some legitimate (not-Snake Oil) products may have a freely exportable version for outside of the USA, which is different from a separate US/Canada-only distribution.  No-frills sig.

Sniffers aren't much effort, and if I sniff your tagged purchases and put them out over the net anonymously, they are traced to you.
Probably, but the Billboard article discussed using CC numbers as an ID in the online watermarked transactions.  Doesn't mean they were correct, of course.
For someone in the misuc counterfit business, the equipment is probably not that expensive.  It's innocuous enough (recording and editing equipment) that it wouldn't draw suspicion.
AFAIK, most "bootlegging" is of unreleased concerts or out-takes. Digital watermarks would be of little use.
I think it's intended for tagging online transactions.  You connect to a company's site and download the latest album or single by some band, presumably with the rights to transfer that to a tape for personal use.
If this becomes a predominant way of buying music or movies in an
eventual future (when most people on the planet are wired) and anonymous purchases disappear (I doubt it) as well as radio broadcasts (another loophole) die out (quite doubtful as well).
Of course you have to be foolish to pirate under such a system using
your own name.

Some bothersome things about this editorial...
IMO, the US does not have a comfortable lead. It's already falling behind considering some of the stronger crypto programs available (at least as freeware) are made outside the US.  Many of the stronger algorithms were invented outside of the US (IDEA for instance).
So why should criminals bother with using standards if they are readable by authorities?
Are they going to magically erase all copies of strong software that is already currently available? (Side note: the Pacifica news report on Friday notes that while Freeh gave his testimony, over 100 copies of PGP were downloaded from MIT's site.)
And evidence cannot be encrypted.  You cannot encrypt an airplane full of cocaine or an unusually expensive car baught by money from drugs, espionage, etc.  Nor can you encrypt bomb-making materials, nor conversations in a room (from your mouth to a telephone receiver).  Nor will encryption do anything about informants inside the communications loop. etc. etc....
It's not clear that terrorism can be tracked, even if it's unencrypted.
The OK and WTC bombings were apparently not encrypted, and there's some allegations that the authorities had advanced warnings of the The controls haven't done much to prevent free software from being exported.  They only control commercial sales of software (and Particularly absent in the WaPo-ed is that many do not trust the authorities (in the US and elsewhere)--particularly the FBI, which
has a long history of extra-legal surveillance.

Really? The RAR archiver is getting quite popular (DOS and OS/2), and uses
a variation of DES in the encryption (according to the authors).  An Italian archiver called CODEC also uses DES.  PGP gets more publicity than
any crypto product around (CNN, NPR, Pacifica, NYTimes,  etc.) and will
likely get bigger as time goes on and as the arguments over escrow proposals
get louder.  MS's C[r]API and Netscape also make people more aware of strong crypto...
Actually, I don't care one whit.
Doesn't counter my question/argument.  Serious criminals with a few braincells who care about wiretapping or protecting their files from the authorities will  obviously not use anything that the government
can read.
Even a ban on unescrowed crypto worldwide will not help.  Every copy of strong crypto software will not magically disappear upon the signing of such treaties and laws.
So?  People can use alternate programs to encrypt the software, such as PGP.
Apparently not successful enough, as the two examples I posted happened successfully.  Banking trails will exist with or without 1. The damage is already done if rights are violated, irregardless of the law.  If the police listen in on your phone conversations because of your political views, you may have legal recourse.... but they've already listened in.
2. Legislative/judicial protections are meaningless if judges don't follow up on them.  Historically they give leeway to the police, and as of late judges that enforce the technicalities are lambasted publicly for letting criminals go free.
3. Israel isn't exactly a prime example of human rights, especially if you're a Palestinian.

Differentiate between the cipher and the key-initialization.  There may be a flaw in how the key is set up that can make brute-force searches easier.  Known plaintext of a few headers may also help in guessing the s-box state, even if partially: combined with flaws in the key, this could be exploited, especially if one has a lot of experience and computing power handy.
Risky.  Code can always be reverse engineered.  If a flaw is exploited in too-strong an algorithm (3DES and 4k-bit RSA keys, for instance) to prosecute various people, somebody might notice. If US companies seem to magically have proprietary info from foreign companies, this would also be a sign of suspicion.   I think the
C[r]API will be used as a form of mandating GAK instead.

"Bombing Becoming All Too Popular"
The Associated Press
Washington - The number of Americans attacking and attempting to attack each other with bombs each year has nearly doubled this decade. For every Olympic park or Oklahamo City tragedy, police report dozens of foiled attempts where death and destruction are narrowly averted.
The rapid escalation poses a vexing problem for law enforcement. Unlike international terrorists with recognized agendas, these culprits are most often low-profile operators plotting in the privacy of back yards, garages and basements with easily obtained materials and simple instructions straight off the Internet.
In 1989, there were 1,699 criminal bombings attemted or carried out nationwide. By 1994, the last year with complete figures, the number has risen to 3,163, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Local cases, which seldom make national headlines, demonstrate the breadth of the threat.
[Examples follow...only one names the Internet:]
In Baton-Rouge, La., an 18-year-ooold dropout and two friends were indicted this month for stealing bomb-making materials from two high-school chemistry labs,  Court records allege the three plotted to blow up a train returning the young woman's parents from vacation to get insurance money, and had followed a terrorist handbook published on the Internet.

The more I think about it, the more that it seems foolish to be against anonymous payee systems.  Mainly because those who want it now (and who will want it in the future) and who have the resources will already have it.
As for catching tax-evaders, criminals, etc... for most the five BMWs, indoor heated pool and yacht should be enough attention for those who really want to know.  Of course the gov't isn't that interested in doing the legwork... better for them to have everything on a computer for easy data-crunching rather than do real footwork. (Can you say downsizing? Nah.... they'd put twice the savings into useless gadgets like attack helicopters to patrol minority neighborhoods with...)
Off the track, slightly:
It seems the effect that these laws have are to make it so only the very wealthy and connected (or perhaps incredibly ambitious and smart) have access to privacy and de facto loopholes in the law.
The only "criminals" who will be able to get away with anything are those who are already so well off (and possibly buddy-buddy with the Powers That Bee, Bzzt!).
Good point. But many consumers want anonymity, or at least to control what information they give customers.  Many might even settle for pseudo-anonymity (ie, account number 123456 likes to buy product X, but whoever 123456 *is* is known only to 123456....).

Actually you could, since the actual encoding isn't random. It means something to the compressor.  And if you know something about compression algorithms you could probably make some good estimates.

Ignore the usual compressor header information and look at a hex dump of the compressed data... think about it in terms of bits.  Look at the algorithm that encoded the data.
A good way to avoid known plaintext is to use a feedback mode with a random IV (from a good RNG!).  Not perfect, of course...

@_subject: The Elevator Problem 
This may be old hat, but an earlier post (around the time the Kocher RSA-timing attack came out) to the list asked about the "Elevator Problem", where two parties who think they share the same secret want to confirm it on an open channel.  I came up with an idea for a protocol but never got around to posting it, and dropped off the list briefly... so pardon me if this is already touched upon.
Alice and Bob are in a crowded place and want to confirm they share a Each picks a couple of random numbers, b and i.  The secret P is hashed i times, something like:
  H_0(P) = H(P,0)               [H can be something like SHA-1...]
  H_i(P) = H(H_i-1(P), i)
They then tell each other bit b of H_i(P).
This is repeated a number of times to make random guessing very If all bits match, they agree that they share the secret (we assume neither wants to lie but discover if the other knows the secret).
Since this is a mutual protocol, an eavesdropper who listens in shouldn't be able to spoof Alice or Bob.  Or maybe Alice and Bob can agree never to reuse combinations of b and i anyway (or they can append a counter to the secret, so that combinations of b and i never give the same values).
Could be useful for implementing as a remote login?

@_subject: Why PGP isn't so ubiquitous (was NRC Session Hiss) 
In part because it's not well integrated with mailers.  That could change with a PGP3 DLL.
PGP isn't only used for email:
 o files distributed over the net that are PGP-signed
 o signed email
 o non-emailed file distributions (over BBS, or physical
    transfer of disks)
 o personal storage (though other utilities are better-suited
    for that than PGP)
 o related utilities that make use of PGP-keys (HPack
    archiver)
The reasons PGP hasn't become widely used are because of it's lack of user-friendliness and poor integration into other tools, irregardless of S/MIME.

I'll add a few comments about the "Java hype monster"... it seems a good way for people to make money off of computing in ways they haven't before (and in ways which probably won't work anyhow).
A lot of the Java hype has been how one only needs a "network appliance" that logs in and uses remote applets which are instantly updated.  Less risk of software piracy, more phone bills and network membership fees, of course. (Nevermind other risks added in this sort of system).  It seems like a kind of cable-tv-for-the-internet.  People will join a service that provides an array of applications. Network membership fees and phonebills... or maybe they'll use cable modems and it will be included with the cable bill on their JavaVision (tm) boxes?
On the plud side, though: C never did standardize graphical interfaces.  Notice most of the demos in the JDK are graphical?

How does this idea sound: a forwarding service/remailer that accepts encrypted and forwards it to someone else (specified in the message), encrypting the message to that person.
Such a service can be set up at a site with *lots* of keys given to it.  This way if one wants to spontaneously send a message to someone that she doesn't have a key for, she can use the service.  (Perhaps the service would only accept or forward mail from/to people who submitted their keys, and possibly eca$h... it could also bounce messages back, re-encrypted, if there's a failure...)
This could be used like anonymous remailers to foil traffic analysis, but also for people who, in certain situations, don't want/need anonymitiy with the person they are corresponding with, and who don't necessarily have keys handy.

Reply-To: inet-access at earth.com
Resent-From: inet-access at earth.com
Jack Rickard says:
Yes, this is a far more significant issue than most ISPs realize - whether
the FCC, in both responding to the Apple-WINForum proposal to allocate
350Mhz of spectrum in the 5Ghz bands for what the FCC dubbed the "NII/SUPERNET" Band for 'no licence' wireless - will do that in BOTH
the 'wireless lan' segment AS WELL AS the requested '15 km' segments
and thus permit anyone, including ISPs to have no-comm cost bandwidth
up to 2Mbps between two points, or, with relay, 1Mbps (above and
below T-1) for the cost of the radios. Spread spectrum technology which
is a revolution in radio communications (wide band, digital processor
controlled low power - with no practical interference versus traditional
narrow frequency band high power - with so much interferecne, the frquencies have to be licenced and highly controlled).
And yes I, and a too-small handful of others are deep into the issues
at the FCC level as the decision hangs in the balance. Because I
am the Principal Investigator on the $375,700 'Wireless Field Test
for Education Project' I was invited to a roundtable with FCC
Commissioners nominally debating 'wireless for education' two weeks
ago, and, using our real-world wireless project going on in the
San Luis Valley (one school being relaibaly connected now 15 miles
at 115kbs, bypassing US West, from NT-Lan router to Cisco Router
at the POP. Zero local loop cost) and reporting on the other
projects we have examined (8 Belen, New Mexico Schools, conected
T-1 between each other in a WAN - up to 10 miles across the district.
Zero local loop cost (which would normally run $84,000 a year wiht
telco T-1 between schools).
We made an impression, but know what giant forces we are up against.
Some FCC staffers want to 'auction' the longer range (even 15km)
stuff. Some big communications companies, led by the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Assn - CTIA, would like all 'no-licence'
that can compete with them to be killed. Our arguements, that got a few thinking anyway, was that IF the FCC
rules permit radios to be made which go 15-45 miles, no licence,
no interference, and solve the problem of the 16,000 school
districts whose biggest problem is the cost of bandwidth *between*
school building of a district first, then the cost from the main
hub to the POP, second, then between the student and/or teacher
at home to the school, at 56kbs or above, THEN the problem of
'community' networking will also be solved. For school districts
are coincident where people live and log on from. (ditto ISPs)
We turned a few heads when I showed my calcuations that, if
the 14 School Districts of the SanLuis Valley are connected to
the one central POP at T-1 by US West, it will cost $1.2 million
over 10 years. If by T-1 25mile radios (yeas they exist now)
it will cost $173,000 for the same 10 years. Now if ISPs want to strike a blow for economic telecom freedom, you can start by accessing our NSF Wireless Field Test web site,
   and go into the Regulatory section
where you will find direct documents, links to the FCC, the
Belen Paper, and my long but piercing piece 'The Case for Public Spectrum' (and if you are a skeptic about the technology,
read the Paul Baran short papers - the invetor of packet switching)
Then all you have to do to sumbit public comments o the NIIBand
matter is to email:
            96-102 at fcc.gov
and that is the email address for the Docket Item. You *must* comment
before July 15th, or yours will not be considered. (but under the law
and regulation, if you *do* comment, your comments must be summarized
by the staff and presented to the COmmissioners with the staff views. You do NOT have to comment on all the heavy duty technical issues.
Right from the chief FCC Engineer who drafts the rules, and was
the father of the original Spread Spectrum rules in 1985 he
says that your statemnt of what you NEED, and why, would be
much appreciated. As simple as 'I am an ISP who needs T-1 from
my site, 8 miles to the nearest POP, no licence/cost wirless,
with a radio I can afford' is to the point. (of course the more
you show your technical economic need in sophisticated terms
the better it will be received. The FCC engineers are no dummies
and political handwaving doesn't impress them (it only impresses
the COmmissioners whenthe handwavers are called AT&T or Congress)
I can just about assure you the FCC staff doesn't even know you
exist, as a class, (small ISPs) or what function you serve in the
food chain, or why you shouldn't just pay $650 a month for your
local loop T-1 like anybody else. And unless you email them
(and they now have a policy that email must be taken as seriously
as formal paper mail filings), your colective case won't even
be mentioned when the likes of Motorola, AT&T, CTIA, the NSA
(who gets gas pains when secure wireless is mentioned) are
All will not be totally lost if this NPRM does not fly (new
spectrum) for we still have the more congested Part 15, 1 watt
bands. And the 4 NSF types who attended the FCC rountable
were impressed enough with our case that we spent a day with them
and they are about to fund a 'developmental' project that will
be done by TAPR, that may bring you that $500 T-1 plug and play
radio, with range. (by licencing the guts to mfgrs).
Matter of fact I will be in Washington DC at the NSF Monday
on this (being carrie dby my sidekick in radio engineering
matters) and two other matters. One of which will (their idea,
not ours) see part of our team in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia in
August, linking 8 sites to the satellite Spintlink downlink
site run by Mongolian engineers in an old Soviet lab. (web
page at  already - but they can't get the signal
across town, so crappy is their phone system). So by September
you willbe pinging systems in Mongolia, the last 10km of
which will be wireless.
I always wanted to help set up the Ghengis Khan BBS in a Mongolian
yurt, running OS2 (cause IBM is everywhere), with NAPLPS character
sets (Chinese, Cyrilli Russian, and Mongolian - none of which
are ascii), solar powered, and with spread spectrum radios
linking China to Russia. With nary a Telco in a hundred miles.
And I got a hunch I will have that done before ISPs in NYC
do it.

Oh yeah, if you   you will reach, by wireless,
the OS2 system in my home. Not blazingly fast beacause I
am trying out a different set of radios. And teh wired 56kbs
frame relay to which it is attached is actuallythe slowest link
in the chain. But its been running 160kbs for almost a year now,
for $0 cost from me to my own Internet service.

Actually, it is much better than Eudora and has plug-ins for encryption.  The native encryption sucks, and the author warns against it (it's there as a demo of the crypto API!).
There *is* a PGP-plugin (w/source) that uses PGP to encrypt or decrypt mail and add keys.  The last version I saw had shitty key management... if you're emailing somebody at an address different from the key-id, it didn't prompt you for another key (and Pegasus 2.2 sent it out in cleartext!).
I don't like the add on much, but many others do, aware of that flaw and some others.
Seems like the person who wrote that message doesn't know what he's talking about.
There's a difference between snake oil and a user who doesn't understand a product.

@_subject: Royalties (was "Re: Micropayments are Crap", which is a boring s 
Excellent example? I dunno. At the non-commercial station I work, once a year or every other year ASCAP or BMI, for a two week period, wants our playlists... not the usual playlists, but detailed ones which even the most anal-retentive people hate to fill out: the performer, the song writer (not always the same), album and song titles, record label, and if music is ASCAP, BMI, etc.  Includes not only songs but them music, background music, etc.
I don't remember the rates, but non-commercial stations pay a lower rate than commercial ones.  Royalties are supposedly divied out to songwriters (and performers?) or record companies based on how much airplay they received, which I guess is averaged out for the whole year.  I don't know if they survey all radio stations around the same time or space it out for different areas and different stations throughout the year.  Touch luck for artists who get some airplay but not enough to make it on the lists, of course.
Digital area: possibility that people will feel because it's computerized, EVERYTHING can be kept track of.    This is problematic, aside from privacy reasons, because the big royalty makers get less and the smaller people get more.  Parallel with experiemtal Nielson-ratings tech... a special cable box that did the monitoring for you, and even had an electronic eye that could tell if anyone was in the room, or if they were sleeping or reading the paper rather than watching... apparently every station got much lower ratings than when people generously filled out booklets, so the stations threatened to set up an alternate system, so I don't know if that system was adopted.
I'm curious as to how royalities are divied up from the cassette tax, since everyone with blank casssettes is, of course, violating copyrights according to some logic.
Will people want royalities for reselling?  There was a flack a few years ago from some big record distributors over used CD sales.  They refused to supply some of the big chains if they continued to sell used CDs without giving them a cut.

@_subject: pretty bad idea (was Re: pretty good reputation) 
Pretty-good, yes. (Assuming she trusts anything signed by Bob.)
Those are private/personal trust values only. Alice rates Bob on how well she'd trust a key signed by Bob.
This is subjective for Alice, based on her relationship with Bob. She may not know him well and assign him a low rating.  Or she may know him all too well, and give him a low rating.  This has no meaning for Carol, or Don, or anyone else, since they have different (if any at all) relationships with Bob.
No, at least not one with meaning.
There are many factors that would go into one's rating of another: how well one knows the other; part history; bias for or against another because of thing like race, religion, political viewpoint, favorite OS, skills/talent or lack thereof, etc.  People's ratings of each other change as well... just imagine global ratings of a once overly well-liked famous person who after several years is now infamous (or an infamous person who is now forgiven).  And again, social pressure to give someone a certain rating...
Generally x+y=1 in this scheme. But lets say for a moment they are separate: x = trust level; y = mixtrust
level, independent of x... that makes little sense, since if y>.5, then Bob
isn't trustworthy, but why is x > y? x and y would always have to be
adjusted for each other... (so it's better off to use something like
But even then, For Alice, x(Bob) > y(Bob), so Bob is trustworthy. For Bob though, x(Alice) < y(Alice).  So what of Carol? She does not yet know Alice and Bob, and sees their ratings about each other [Note: some people would assign ratings based on others; others would assign ratings based on personal experience... another problem with a global rating scheme].
Carol asks Alice about Bob, who says he's trustworthy.  She asks Bob
about Alice, who says Alice is untrustworthy.  If Alice is correct, then according to Bob she's not worth listening to, but then why listen to Bob.  If Bob is correct, Alice isn't worth listening to, but then again, maybe Bob isn't since she says Bob is... so why should Carol bother with any of them.
Ok, in real life it's possible to meet two people, one of him is a liar but not so much as to admit another is more truthful... and that truthful person agrees.  It's actually quite common... but how does a third person who doesn't know any of them figure it out? How does a computer program using a formula?
But given a system with several variables (ie, several people rating each
other) you'll have something that's even harder to resolve.  Given a global system with thousands or millions of variables... how does one make sense of all those ratings about a particular aspect of one Oh no.  There's also a lot of inconsistency there too.  Doesn't matter if you use boolean or fuzzy values.
You're ignoring how much Alice trusts Bob, how much Carol trusts Bob and how much Alice trusts Carol.
Why should that person carry more weight? (more weight than who else?)
What if all the people who trust that person are idiots?  Why should I, or you, or anyone else care about somebody more or less because "x number of people trust so-and-so"?
There's another flaw.  And what if those people trust him? Exponentially increasing trust?
Not many people know Snoopy, so he has no trust level.  Nobody wants to get to know Snoopy just because he has no trust level.  He's locked out.
Bad idea.
No. Individuals put their ratings in the web to skew or confuse No-frills sig.

You could require *very good* passphrases.
Rather than changing a passphrase, revoke the key. Perhaps expire keys after a certain period of time.
Longer lasting keys (such as a digital timestamp service) would save private keys with a protected password instead.

@_subject: Science Lessons in the Mountains of New Mexico 
So where did you get this promotional hype? At least quote your sources. (Or did you write this?)
The tone of that piece sounds like an advert telling me to invest $$$ into Santa Fe Inst.
Methinks "Complexity theory" (aka Dynamical Systems Theory) is wonderful hype to get research grants.  Certain people think by throwing money into this area that they can predict better, when much of theory deals with how these systems *cannot* be well predicted in *some* areas of behavior.  Other people over-mystify the complexity of a system and declare *nothing* can be predicted, of course.
Something akin to 60s-70s electrical utility exces bragging to each other on golf courses about how they own nuke plants.  Hip thing now is for the company to invest in research or use methods based on "Chaos Theory"... you'll be really cool at parties if you drop those words to people. Any form of analysis that uses lots of variables gets labelled as having to do with "Chaos Theory" and the research grants grow, even though it may not deal with those variables as a *dynamic system*. Substance though?
Not that studies in compelx systems are useless. By far the opposite.
(though the question of useful to *who* is important.  Using chaos theory to enhance methods of central control rather than allowing emergent behaviors is one downside of what some people are looking to the Santa Fe institute for.)
Other than noting crypto in the first paragraph and mentioning SmartCards, what does this have to do with crypto and socio- political implications of widespread use of crypto?
ObCrypto: similarities in literature on chaos theory and cryptanlysis.  I've seens refs to using various forms of chaotic equations or cellular automata for crypto, but most of the writers seem ignorant of any crypto-literature (never mentioning that Wolfram's PRNG is crackable, for instance). Backburner Idea: if all 1D CA's are equivalent to LFSRs, and if [need to find refs to this alleged proof] all 2+D CA's have an equivalent 1D CA, then if a crypto algorithm can be duplicated as a CA...
Alas I ramble on about ideas which I am not an expert at...

DEVELOPING NATIONS SEE BRIGHT FUTURE IN SMART CARDS
When it comes to full-scale trials of smart card technology, developing
countries such as Zambia and Thailand are way ahead of the U.S.  The new
payment systems are finding greater acceptance in countries where
traditional banking practices are not so firmly entrenched.  "No one's in a
hurry for a new payment system here because our system already works," says
a U.S. programmer who designed Zambia's smart card system.  "Our country is
expanding, and we don't have enough banks and no automated teller
machines...  The lines are very long,"  says a spokesman for the Zambian
embassy in Washington.  And smart cards provide valuable access to other
technological advances:  "Developing nations are using smart cards to
leapfrog the need to build telecommunications infrastructures," says a Visa

I'm wondering if anyone has done any work on schemes to lower the
entropy of a given stream.  Why?  Save you've got message M encrypted
with a good cipher, but you're worried that it can be detected because
even with stego, the entropy is a lot higher than normal 'random' data
flowing through a network.
So it seems possible to create a scheme that given a key will take a
block of n bits and expand it to 1.5n or 2n bits, recoding it in such
a way that determining the key is difficult even if one suspects such
a scheme has been used... but that using the scheme will make the data
look more like the MSBs of graphical data rather than encrypted data.

 Folks:
 Good day.  By way of introduction, I'm the consultant who  did the
 "anti-mailstorm/anti-mailbomb" software that runs on the MX host for
 WHITEHOUSE.GOV.  Now that the Telecom. Act of 1996 has been signed,
 the volume of mail through WHITEHOUSE.GOV has gone up significantly.
 For example, there were about 85,000 lines in the mail log file yesterday.
 Most of that is just people who want to express their opinion.  However,
 several misguided individuals have decided that they want to throw a monkey
 wrench into the works by storming the President's email.
 I'm writing this to let any system administrators out there know that you
 may find mail from your site to WHITEHOUSE.GOV is not moving very quickly.
 This is normal; it's a sign that the automatic protections of that system
 have kicked in.
 Without going into details, if too many messages come from a single site,
 the mail handler will throttle back accepting messages.  Eventually,
 though, the mail will be accepted for delivery.  If you have legitimate
 mail, it will eventually get through (many messages from the same
 correspondent will be flushed without acknowledgement).  However,

@_subject: Fractals, Cellular Automata, and Encryption 
Interesting point. I've dabbled with CA a little bit, though not in terms
of crypto.  I think at best CA can be used for stream ciphers... and
a big problem is that people assume it's a totally new form of computing,
when in fact it's only a different form, and anything that can be done
with a conventional formula-based scheme can be done with CA and visa-
versa... the pitfall is that one can get all caught up in how chaotic CA
behaves and lose sight that the same thing can be done in a formula, and
that possibly it can be easily broken.
Fractals are interesting. I've thought about using the Julia-set
iterations as a form of crypto (or for that matter, recursive methods
in general)... maybe a kind of block cipher that works with complex
numbers, but using the words as fractions rather than whole numbers.
Perhaps using 64-bit binary fractions, and iterating X = X^2 + C, where
the iteration count and C are keys... using the result as a kind of
stream cipher.  Problem is it would be slow on most machines.
I've also thought about genetic algorithms.  An interesting ideal would
be a genetic algorithm that operated on plaintext, key, ciphertext but
would be self-analyzing and evolve itself in ways to make cryptanalysis

It should also be available at the ftp.wimsey.com and ftp.funet.fi sites soon.
NOISE.SYS is a /dev/random driver for DOS systems, similar to the random.c implementation for Linux and FreeBSD.  It sets up two devices, "random" and "urandom" which return streams of crypto- quality random bytes based on fast timings from the keyboard IRQ, disk access, Windows 3.x message broadcasts, mouse movement, and cpu clock drift, with some experimental kluges to sample the audio card input [to be improved in future versions].  The raw samples are mixed using a polynomial function and then hashed using SHA-1.  Entropy estimation is based on arithmetic coding schemes and how often samples recur, rather than on the sample deltas themselves.
The source is included (in 386 assembler) and is relatively easy to modify and experiment with [plenty of comments and macros].

A diary isn't illegal... but if you are suspected or even convicted of a crime, and there's reason to believe that a book or computer file is a diary and that you wrote about more crimes in the diary, then it's worth investigating.
Just as if one is suspected of money laundering and it is known that that person has Swiss or Cayman Island bank accounts... having them doesn't mean one is guilty, but if there is other evidence that the crime took place then they are well within the realm of No. It's just another area of potential evidence.
One can argue that, yes. In fact I remember some LE type who was pro-crypto who insisted the DT Bill was for lazy cops who didn't want to do the footwork necessary for an investigation.
Another is when they cited the World Trade Ctr bombing... seems they already had a handle that it was in the works and did nothing anyway. DT or a crypto-ban or GAK would not have prevented that.
And in some ways one has less rights when in contempt of court then when convicted of a felony....
Ideally, that is how the system works.  But if they have a good reason to suspect something is evidence (and in the above pedaphile ase a file named "diary.pgp" would probably qualify) a warrant can be Note that just having PGP-encrypted files would not necessarily be evidence either.

If you voluntarily escrow your key (as with a corporation) and the holder is bribed to give it to a competitor, it may be more worth the holder's while to break a contract for the dollars the competitor may bribe him with.  It makes sense to have some criminal punishments for that.

They (FTC) might go by something different, though. If a company claims their product uses an "unbreakable cipher" when there are cracking programs (commercial or free) available, then obviously its false advertising.  Indeed anything that advertises itself as "unbreakable" is a lie.
There's also other consumer groups that are non-governmental, like Consumer Reports, PIRGs, and even various state and county consumer advoctates who won't tow the federal line (look at bovine growth hormone for one example... hm, maybe a bad parallel.)
Part of it is a public learning curve. After a while more people (though not enough to eliminate snake oil's market) will recognize "PGP", "RSA", 'IDEA", "3DES" and other strong algorithms. (Ascom Tech could do themselves a nice turn by pushing for products with "IDEA Inside" type of messages...)

Welcome to the privacy mailing list!
Here's the general information for the list you've
subscribed to, in case you don't already have it:
ABOUT THE PRIVACY MAILING LIST
Welcome to the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Consumer
Protection Privacy Principles mailing list.  The Bureau has
established this list as a forum for discussing the privacy
principles that should be applicable to consumers' use of the
Global Information Infrastructure.  The Bureau seeks commentary
and resource materials from consumers, industry, privacy
advocates and others who are concerned about questions such as
the following:
What information is routinely gathered online now, and what is
industry doing with this information?  How will the nature of the
information gathered or the uses to which it is put change in the
next few years?
What control should consumers have over personal and
transactional information?
How should consumers be able to exercise that control?
What expectations do consumers have regarding the use of
information about them?
What are the respective obligations of online service providers,
content providers, and consumers themselves to address these
privacy concerns?
Should certain uses of information be off limits without the
consumer's explicit consent?
Under what circumstances should consumers have the ability to
access and correct information about them?
Additional related topics for discussion are welcome.  The
dialogue that takes place in response to these questions will be
invaluable to the Bureau.  It will facilitate the creation
of a set of voluntary principles governing the use of consumer
information in transactions in cyberspace. To post messages to this list, simply address your mail to:

@_subject: PC: Using BIOS Wait function as a source of entropy? 
In some older versions of the NOISE.SYS random driver I experimented with calling the BIOS Wait function which uses the CMOS timer to pause, using the "drift" between timing differences.  There appears to be some variation here, but I don't have enough documentation (and have yet to hack with the BIOS myself) to figure out what goes on exactly when one calls Int 15h/AH=86h, so I don't know if this is "real" clock drift of if the variation is caused by somehting else unsuitable for an RNG.
Still, it seems interesting.

I did some more tests with the variation when sampling the timer before and after a call to the BIOS Wait function on my PC.  Set the delay to 977ms, which is allegedly the counter's resolution and collected samples at even intervals (various ones) and found recurring patterms.  For instance, sampling every timer tick (about 55ms) produced a repeating pattern where every 16th sample had a delta well over 1200 while all the others were under 900, usually under 800.  Every so often the 16th sample delta was very low instead (between 400 and 600).
Plotting the samples in a noise sphere showed very definite streaks with a few spots in isolated areas.
So this is NOT a good method to use after all.
I'm still curious as to what causes the variation.  Maybe has to do with the CPU cache or port interfaces with the CMOS timer?

compressability, <6 bits/byte Maurer, and "non-random" in chi-squared] but
in the plot no discernable pattern shows up.... similar to plotting the

  NOISESPH.PAS, A Noise Sphere plotter written in Turbo Pascal (23-Mar-96)
  Robert Rothenburg Walking-Owl   No copyright is claimed.  No guarantees made.
  Usage: noisesph file
  This program reads a file of random or pseudo-random data and plots
  a noise sphere of the data. Poor RNGs or sampling methods will show
  clear patterns (definite splotches or spirals).
  The theory behind this is to get a set of 3D polar coordinates from
  the RNG and plot them.  An array is kept of the values, which is
  rotated each time a new byte is read (see the code in the main
  procedure).
  Rather than plot one sphere which can be rotated around any axis,
  it was easier to plot the sphere from three different angles.
  This program is based on a description from the article below.  It
  was proposed as a means of testing pseudo-RNGs:

The generalized halting problem comes to mind...
Since it can be proved that there's no complete set of heuristics
to tell if a given program has a characteristic (such as "secureness")
then sooner or later someone will discover another security flaw.
A question is whether a simple patch is made or if the set of heuristics
is widened (ie, learn from mistakes) so that similar flaws can be found
based on knowledge of that one flaw.

@_subject: Crypto CD UpDate 
A very good point... But that depends on the crypto put on the CD-ROM.  Some files aren't as
liable to version-decay, especially source codes and papers (which IMO
is more useful than fully-implemented crypto programs).
A CD-ROM that contains source codes (in various languages) and descriprions for ciphers, hashes, cryptanalysis methods, and even some cultural-political screeds would be more useful than one that contains
'the latest version of PGP'.
And actually version-decay isn't that bad an issue.  Put a warning file
in the CD-ROM about that, with pointers to crypto ftp- and web sites.
The publisher being comitted to putting out a new CD-ROM every year is
probably often enough in most cases.
A nice advantage of CD-ROMs is that many BBSs that aren't plugged into
the net use them.  I rememebr showing threads about a similar C'punks
CD-ROM discussion a couple of years ago to some local BBS-sysops asking
about new CD-ROMs (bored of the usual Pier and NightOwl fair)... they
were really into the idea, if nothing else than it was "hip" with a
nice plitical edge but also had a utility and education value that surpassed the usual gobbleware CDs.
An reference sources for hashes or ciphers and papers about them, plus
some papers about general crypto principles necessary for all newsbies
and even gurus to (re)read would be really useful.

I disagree.  The methods of timing (how to sample a specific timer) and the various interactions  that generate the entropy *are* system specific.  Code written for Suns won't work on PCs or Amigas or Macs, etc.  The implementation would probably be better if it were built into the OS, which rules out Win95, DOS, OS/2, Macs, etc. (unless the companies decide to add such a feature...)
Good question. You'd need to look for patterns.  Barring none, you'd have to guess the factors that lead to the entropy, and then see if there's a way to reverse-engineer it. (Perhaps use a stripped down system and build it up, or disable some of the hardware and OS features etc.)
Another question: how do you estimate entropy?

It seems quite doable to add support for SHA-1 signatures (and possibly key
generation for encrypting secret keys?).
Adding 3DES (and maybe Luby-Rackoff-SHA, assuming it hasn't been cracked
recently at the Fast Software Conf.... more info?!?) would be nifty too...
unless, of course, there's meaning to the Real Soon Now that PGP3 folx
d work on the hack now (and just might...) but I'm stuck stranded in the

        Wired World Will "Diminish National Sovereignty"
WIRED WORLD WILL "DIMINISH NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY"
A leading Clinton Administration official on information security and
cryptography matters says that traditional notions of sovereignty, national
security and warfare will be undermined by the year 2020, when the whole
world is "wired" and e-cash is the norm.  The result will be less powerful
governments in relation to criminal organizations such as the Mafia and
international drug cartels, says Michael Nelson, who adds that organized
crime members are already some of the most sophisticated users of computer
systems and strong encryption technology.  In addition, computer crackers
will pose a more significant threat.  In response, Nelson advocates
resolving the issue of whether unauthorized access of a computer is an "act
of trespass" or an "act of war," and prosecuting the intrusions accordingly.

@_subject: Snake Oil FAQ 0.4 [comments appreciated] 
For those not-yet-in-the-know: I no longer have the time to manage it and asked for somebody (and Matt agreed to) to take the Snake Oil
FAQ's care and feeding.
Note that this is not cc'd to coderpunks. I don't think it's appropriate for coderpunks.
Does it need to be posted monthly?  Better to post pointers to it most of the time, possibly to other places as well  (alt.2600 comes
to mind...).
Perhaps when the first 'non-beta' of this document is released a History could be added.
Nitpick: Hm. Change that to "no product will serve every need".
Or more clearly: is encryption THE feature of the utility, or is it an added feature?  It's better to use separate utilities made for that purpose rather than one that tries to do everything.
Change to "making brute force attacks--that is, trying every possible That's a controversial comparison. I've read references (from a couple of years ago) saying that a 3k-bit RSA key is as strong as a 128-bit IDEA key.
Trying to compare the two (symmetric and assymetric) is like running through a tar pit.
Of course, how is an amateur supposed to know if these terms are found in the literature? That was a recurring comment that people sent me when I first posted the FAQ.
Typo! "uses to different method..."?
Hm. How about "that are widely believed"?
[..] Although it is(?) mentioned below, I'd emphasize here in some way that the users of the OTP generate the key.  Somebody else sending you a supposed OTP that he generated is not secure.
Explain random session keys and initialization vectors.  A glossary at the end of the document would be a good thing.
Oh yeah.  These need to be explained.  What I had in mind was timing attacks against RSA or IDEA, or factoring of public keys.
"often" not?!? (oops...was that my wording?) They aren't the same, though often they are confused in snake oil.
That is, if you lose the key, you don't want a third party to have as much a chance to recover it as you do.
Also... if the vendor does not understand export restrictions, avoid the software. I'm thinking of a certain snoil-vendor who said 128-bit IDEA keys were'nt secure since they could be exported.
Such exportable versions are not as secure, of course.
I wanted to add some sort of 'non-guru hacks' to test a product. One example might be to actually examine 'encrypted' files to see if they are really encrypted. (I'm thinking of the AMG archiver, which only encrypted the CRC; CODEC archiver also only encrypted the CRC is a file is not compressed.)
Thanks again for taking over the FAQ.  A good job!

I think they use combination locks, actually. Supposedly it's the same

There was an article in 2600 Magazine about that. The locks are actually 'insecure' and you can test every possible combo in about
10-20 minutes.

yourself.  2.6.2 is fine. Older versions actually have some minor bugs.
You'd be using a version with holes in it. Why not read the source code
of the new version and verify it's security yourself? (If you can't

trusting it no matter what.)

Good point: but I've seen a few refs from LEAs about "Drug Dealer X who we can't talk about" or "Child Pornographer Y who we can't talk about" (in lieu of cases being digested by the court system) so I didn't harp on that point.
A point I did leave out was that if they already knew these people were criminals and were building cases against them, monitoring them enough to know they used crypto, then do they really need to bother with listening in to the exact message?
I wanted to emphasize the phallacy of the sacrifical lamb of rights in the name of the god of security.  Also, they mungled the letter enough, so it's better for LI Newsday (which caters to a reading level of the average 12-year-old) submissions to be kept short and I'm quite surprised that mine is the only letter they printed. Certainly they would have gotten more than one submission on a controversial subject?

This is probably not an original idea, but...
Here's a potential use for E-cash: a server that doles out Java apps to clients; the clients run the apps, calculating whatever results are needed, and uploads the results in return for E-cash
(perhaps a zero-knowledge proof that the result is accurate? another is to use only a trusted pool of registered and accountable users rather
than anonymous clients).
The server admins would be paid by those who need computations,
keeping a percentage and using the rest to be offered as E-cash to clients with spare computing power.
A lot of possibilities here... a configuration where a set price is offered for a computation (the user can check for the highest offer on a server, or refuse an offer below a certain amount).
Or maybe applets would only be doled out to systems that meet a certain criteria (minimum computing power).
A more complex system where 'bids' are placed based on computing power is possible too (those w/better systems would want more cash, or be willing to pay it).
Problem: open to forms of 'abuse' (imagine a sysadmin making E-cash using his employer's machines overnight).
It might make an interesting experimental project to work on.

@_subject: Workaround for filtering/cybersitter 
Depends who is doing the filtering? If it's mom and dad keeping you from
looking at naughty pix, maybe.
If it's the gov't keeping you from looking at subversive sites, maybe not:
they'll go out of their way to block such proxies, and in some countries you
could get in hellish trouble for owning such a plug-in.

@_subject: Log File a security hole? 
Is there a way to disable the \WINDOWS\PGPW_32.LOG?
In subtle ways it's a security hole if left to accumulate over time,
since it keeps records of which keys you encrypted messages to.
(Imagine somebody using an anonymous remailer but g-d forbid is unaware of this log file, and somebody discovers that messages were encrypted to such a beast...)
I understand in certain group/corporate environs one would want logging; in others, one doesn't need it or should have the option (in an easily found place) to wipe it every once in a while.

@_subject: PGPMail Log File 
Well, I just found that option to uncheck it (thanks to your message) so
I'll try it w/the log file unchecked and see what happens. (Duh!)

It's disabled, with the exception of keeping when it was last run.
a 'security hole' but so minor I can live with it.
Maybe your version (I'm using beta 11) has a problem, but mine's
fine. I was just careless and didn't look closely (not something one
should do with crypto...)
