I sent him some sound bites about Internet policy and about crypto policy.
I'll send them to Cypherpunks too.

Dear Internauts and friends,
I have been invited to testify before the US House Subcommittee on
Technology on the subject of technology policy and information
intrastructure. To prepare my testimony, it would be helpful to
have SHORT (please!) comments, suggestions, "bullets" as input,
so that Internet Society ideas and considerations can be represented
(or, at the least, offer some national and international perspective
on a matter of global importance).
If you want to send something on this point, please send it ONLY
ADDRESSEES (or they will do something terrible to me).
Many thanks for letting me disturb your busy mailboxes, and thanks
in advance for your ideas.
p.s. I need any inputs by end of February
