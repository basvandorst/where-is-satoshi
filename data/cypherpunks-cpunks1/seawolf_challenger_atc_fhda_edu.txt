I think the point here is that its not safe to send credit cards
over the net and just like in rl, you got protect yourself by keeping
a close eye on your credit card transactions. And to prove to
our governments that RSA40 isn't a 'good enough' any more.
On the other hand getting access to 120 workstations should'nt be to
difficult for any system admin. Take my school for example, I could
run the program on some 100 odd SGI Indy workstations, 2 SGI challenge S's
and a challenger DM (2cpus) along with 2 DEC Alphas
As long as I set it to a have high nice value, nobody would notice, or even
mind. Sameer Manek                Seawolf at challenger.atc.fhda.edu

@_subject: PGP for pine 
Does anyone know of an addon to the Pine mailer that supports PGP? the only PGP software i could find required me to first compose a
letter in an editor then run it through a pgp signature program
then finally read it into my favorite mailer.
I'm looking for something that is hopefully transparent, or if not
relatively quick to do.

@_subject: Sigh Re: not a flame please read and think about this 
I think we can end this childish flaming. I hope both Pat and na116512
are mature enough enough not to respond to this post and if they
want to make sure they keep the mailing list out of this.
If you both want to flame each other take it to private email and flame away.
