Nice hack Norm.
This would appear to apply to any processor where the floating point
performance is substantially greater than the integer.  This is true
of the Pentium too.

The 96002 is a floating point part.  Last time I checked it cost
several hundred dollars.  I suspect that you were refering to the
56001/2 family (which does cost something like $50).

That's one of the driving reasons for using Montgomery multiplication.
You do some up front work that changes the representation into one
where the reduction on each multiply is a multple of 2^N (a shift, or
fetch of the LSW or MSW of the result).

@_subject: DECEMBER '94: Object/Document Security BOF 
Group Name: Object/Document Security BOF (ios)
IETF Area : Security Area
Date/Time : Wednesday, December 7, 1994
            0930-1200
The purpose of this BOF is to present information and to discuss ideas
associated with document/object security, store and forward security,
and third-party security services.  The general idea of creating
protected objects (e.g. signed documents, encrypted files) which
can be accessed and transferred by a variety of applications is
being discussed in several contexts - store and forward extensions
to GSSAPI, PEM-MIME work, www security, etc.
We would like to discuss requirements and constraints for a general capability for protected objects and explore the need
for a common approach to providing these types of services.
The BOF is scheduled for 9:30am Wednedsay December 7th. The IOS
(Information Object Security) BOF is within the Security Directorate.
If you're interested in this area, we hope you can attend.
We are planning to present some of our ideas on the requirements and
goals for general protected objects as well as details on an
Information Object Security project BBN is currently working on for
ARPA (short summary below).  This project has developed security tools
for protection of documents and objects as well as for invoking and
performing trusted third party services.
We're looking for anyone else who would like agenda time to either
present specific work/ideas or to discuss requirements and other
contexts for protected objects.  If you'd like to volunteer either
send a message to jlowry at bbn.com or just show up and we can sort out
the agenda there.
Finally there will be a discussion to determine whether there is
interest in continuing.  Should a mailing-list be formed ?  Is there
enough interest and focus to attempt creation of a working group
charter ?  After the BOF, we're prepared to demonstrate prototype IOS
tools for any interested parties.
IOS Project
These tools allow the users to apply multiple parallel and
sequential signatures and annotations to objects/documents, and to
provide access control and confidentiality protections to these
There are a number of utilities available to perform certificate
validation and maintain a cache of certificates.  Included in the
tool set is an ASN.1 to C++ compiler.
Third-party services are also under investigation and the issues
of a trusted time-stamp server, third-party involvement in
non-repudiation, and proof of delivery, submission, and receipt
are addressed.
Documents describing the IOS project tools and architecture are
available for anonymous ftp from the server ftp.bbn.com in the
directory /pub/outgoing/ios_docs.

This memo describes the IPv6 Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP). ESP seeks to provide integrity and confidentiality to IPv6 datagrams. It may also provide authentication, depending on which algorithm and algorithm mode are used.  Non-repudiation and protection from traffic analysis are not provided by ESP.  The IPv6 Authentication Header (AH) might provide non-repudiation if used with certain authentication algorithms.  The IPv6 Authentication Header may be used in conjunction with ESP to provide authentication.  Users desiring integrity and authentication without confidentiality should use the IPv6 Authentication Header (AH) instead of ESP.  This document assumes that the reader is familiar with the related document "IPv6 Security Architecture", which defines the overall security architecture for IPv6 and provides important background for this specification.

Here are a couple of more internet drafts relevant to secure email.
       Title     : Security Multiparts for MIME:                     Multipart/Signed and Multipart/Encrypted                                            Author(s) : J. Galvin, S. Murphy, S. Crocker, N. Freed

       Pages     : 10
       Date      : 11/23/1994
This document defines two new content types for specifying the application of security services to MIME message bodies.  MIME, an acronym for "Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions", defines the format of the contents
of Internet mail messages and provides for multi-part textual and non-textual message bodies.  The new content types are subtypes of multipart: signed and encrypted.  Each will contain two body parts: one for
the protected data and one for the control information necessary to remove the protection.  The type and contents of the control information body parts are determined by the value of the protocol parameter of the enclosing multipart/signed or multipart/encrypted content type, which is required to be present.

This document specifies how the services of MIME and PEM can be used in a complementary fashion.  MIME, an acronym for "Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions", defines the format of the contents of Internet mail messages and provides for multi-part textual and non-textual message bodies.  PEM, an acronym for "Privacy Enhanced Mail", provides message authentication/integrity and message encryption services for Internet mail messages.

@_subject: PRZ encrypted voice software release imminent 
asynchronous networks are a completely different beast than your basic
point-to-point phone call.  Over.
If you expect people to use a secure voice communication device,
they've got to like it.  Over.
I don't know anybody who prefers more latency.  Over.
I think that it makes great sense to optimize for a point-to-point
connection.  I also believe that it should be an un-error corrected
channel (no V.42 or V.42bis) since many speech coders can tolerate
the errors.
Knowing the channel characteristics also allows you to tailor your
crypto usage.  If you know you've got a raw synchronous channel, and
Pr(bit insert or bit delete) << Pr(bit error) than you can avoid a lot
of overhead.  This does matter where bandwidth is tight.  Say,
sticking a 13,000 bit/s coder down a 14,400 bit/s pipe.  With GSM's
260 bit frame every 20ms, it leaves 28 bits per frame for all
overhead.  This includes any forward error correction, sync
maintenance, crypto IV's etc.  You can't tune this in the driver.
None of this says that you shouldn't also optimize for the packetized
case too.  I think that you can negotiate the right behavior at start
up time based on detected channel characteristics.  I think that the
biggest impact is in the framing overhead, or lack of it.
You are always trading off bandwidth, speech quality and MIPs.

pushed around somewhere else in the spectrum.  The data is apparently
modulated using a variant on QAM, and the data rate varies dynamically
depending on whether or not you are saying anything.
As I recall the block diagram is ...

@_subject: The Fortezza random number generator is not trustworthy 
I was under the impression that a seed for the RNG is loaded into the
Fortezza at initialization time.  This would make me think that they
are using a cryptographically strong PRNG.  This would give data that
appears random, but is completely determined by the initial state.
I suspect that the "seed keys" provided by the two agencies used to
program the Clipper chips has the same properties.  This makes the
question about how does the NSA get access to the key escrow database
moot.  They don't need access.  They know a priori all the unit keys.

than products based on the US Data Encryption Standard (single DES).
In addition, unlike the government's "Clipper" proposal, the CS8191
does not reveal or "escrow" the encryption keys with third parties.
The CS8191 has been designed to work with conventional analog
telephone systems (POTS).  The unit connects between your telephone
and the wall. In 'clear' mode, your telephone continues to work as it
normally does. Pressing the 'go secure' button encrypts
conversations. Communication Security has also incorporated a
leading-edge speech coder.  Voice clarity is undisturbed whether the
system is in 'secure' or 'clear' mode. With many of today's standard technologies, anyone can gain access to
our most private of conversations.  The Communication Security
Corporation dedicates their resources to addressing the increasing
need for private, secure voice communication devices. The introduction
of the CS8191 paves the way for research and development for
additional communication security devices for cell phones, modems, fax
machines and computers. For more information on the CS8191, please

My favorite one was an 11/34 with "Hardware Floating Point" that had a

using your handy dandy fortran program, and then let it rip.  As long
as you weren't trying to do hidden line removal, or draw more than
about 200 vectors, you could get smooth, real-time wire frame

somebody like Henry Kissinger) that were using technical libraries.
After all, they might find something there that they could use against
the US of A.  Certain librarians or assitants were approached to see if they would
be snitches.  Often times this took place without the head librarians
even being notified of the program.  There is a book about this written

Programmed Gate Arrays.  It appears to be a reasonable way to get some
Wiener chips built.  As I recall, the Wiener design required about
23,000 gates.  Their blurb had the following table in in:

    40,000      20,000      $77        $45         $10
   Not Avail   200,000     $176       $150         $82
So it appears that you can get 5000 Wiener key search chips build for
about $50K.  I'm not sure about the speed, but I wouldn't be surprised
if you could clock these at 50 MHz.  The Wiener design is pipelined
and searches one key per clock, so each chip could search 50e6 keys /
second.  50e6 * 5000 = 250e9 keys / second for $50K

You typically only need to tune into either the forward or reverse
channel.  You can usually hear both sides (one may be down a few dB).
This is probably a result of acoustic coupling from the speaker into
the microphone on one or both ends (could also be near-end hybrid

contain a simple RISC core, lots of I/O pins and something like 4-8KB

cheap to build and easy to interface to.  Schmlumberger is currently

I've been enjoying the 1996 Wiretap report.  A couple of my favorite

(1) Of the 1149 intercept applications authorized for 1996,      821 were for "Narcotics" and 114 were for "Gambling".      I.e., 81% of the authorized intercepts were targeted at good old
    fashioned entrepreneurs.
(2) In the past 11 years (1986 - 1996) a total of 9,912 intercept
    applications were approved.  Of that number 5 (five!) were for
    "Arson, explosives, and weapons."  Unless they've classified wiretaps
    against "suspected terrorists" in the "Other" category, it looks
    as if the LEOs don't think (targeted) wiretaps are useful for stopping
    small groups of modestly skilled people bent on blowing things up. No Shit.

In addition, to keep life even more interesting, prior to exchanging
the public exponentials g^x and g^y, commitments (hashes) to those
values are exchanged...  If the commitments don't match the final

What the commitment prevents is a birthday attack on the verification
code by Mallet.  Mallet has to be able to come up with a g^x' that
when concatenated with g^y and hashed computes the same verification
code as g^x concatenated with g^y and hashed.
Exchanging commitments to g^x and g^y prior to sending g^x and g^y
severely constrain the the degree of freedom that Mallet has to work
with.  (Another option that works the same way is the "interlock"
protocol, where each side sends half the message (g^x or g^y) and
doesn't send the second half until after receipt of the first half
from the other end).
None of this is designed to provide authentication of the end point.
It is designed to ensure that you've got a private channel to the end
point. Agreed.  The primary difficulty is getting the public keys into the
unit.  And agreeing on what kind of certificate to use...  My preference (for patent reasons) would be to use DSA or ElGamal

I concur from the theoretical point of view.
In a practical sense I guess it all boils down to what our working
definition of authentication is.  If I'm using one of my phones and
talking to somebody that I know (recognize voice, speech patterns,
shared history, ...) and the verification codes check out, I'm highly
confident that there is no man-in-the-middle.  I'm free to have
whatever conversation I like, modulo bugs in the room, laser window
bounce listeners, etc.
On the "beat the verification codes by spoofing the voice" thread:
I don't think that this is a practical threat.  You've got the
computational challenge (described in the previous posts) and the
human part.  The complications come from the fact that you've got two
live people having a conversation with each other.  At least in the
conversations I have, we don't read these things back and forth like
robots to each other.  In secure mode there are 6 hex digits displayed on each unit.  On one
unit, the first three digits are underlined.  On the other unit, the
last three digits are underlined.  By convention, you say the three
that are underlined, and listen for the other three.  This seems to
work out pretty well in practice.  There is generally a "Hi, I'm
looking at 1FC", "4D9, good.  What's up?" type of interaction.

Hey, it's only a factor of two too expensive...  Moore's law is your friend...
The units currently have 2K bytes of EEPROM and 256K bytes of FLASH.
A little under half the flash is currently available, though it will
probably be taken advantage of during remote upgrades (coming soon to
a crypto phone near you...)  There's plenty of room for long term
storage of a reasonable set of public keys.  Private or symmetric keys
present a problem, since then you've got a long term secret to store
To forestall a bunch of questions about remote upgrades:      (1) there is a jumper on the write line to the FLASH.  If you're
        totally paranoid, leave it in the "Read Only" position.
    (2) upgrades will be digitally signed.
    (3) It'll be a "pull" upgrade.  I.e., you have to request the
        upgrade.  They're not just pushed down your throat.
I can pretty much be done all in software on a laptop.  I've explained the details several times.  Perhaps if folks we're
paying me lots of money for the info, they would listen closer ;-)
The primary thing you lose is the simple integration with the
telephone.  A small (cheap) hardware hack can work around this.  Yes,
I know you'd prefer not to have any non-standard hardware, but on the
other hand, if the system is a pain in the ass to use, nobody is going
to use it.

an unauthenticated 2k-bit Diffie-Hellman and be done with it.

GSM and CDMA phones come with the crypto enabled.  The crypto's good
enough to keep out your neighbor (unless he's one of us) but if you're
that paranoid, you should opt for the end-to-end solution.  The CDMA
stuff (IS-95) is pretty broken: *linear* crypto function, takes 1
second worst case to gather data sufficient to solve 42 equations in
42 unknowns, but again, what's your threat model?  Big brother and
company are going to get you at the base station...
At our house we've pretty much given up on wired phone lines.  We use
cell phones as our primary means of communication.  Turns out that
with the bundled roaming and long distance, it works out cheaper than
what we used to pay for long distance service.  There is that pesky
location transponder problem though.
