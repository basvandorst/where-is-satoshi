advocate.  "getting away with something" also means breaking the law
when the law is severely screwed up.  Privacy is needed to maintain
our human rights, which brings in the Bill of Rights.  Me too.. but maybe my opinions are about the overthrowing of the government

that the govt. is determined to get away with whatever they want.. meaning
to take our money and spy on us.  It's a waste of thought and energy
for them to pretend they're on our side.  I follow the physical laws
[as we're aware of them] only part of the time.. and I'll be damned if
I play along with their games of rape and pillage on the most grandiose of
scales.  We SHOULD be concerned with what means of encryption we can
harness to give us the best possible privacy.. NOT what encryption will
the govt. allow us to use so they can still listen whenever they want.
Suggestion: Disband the government - now THERE's a waste of bandwidth.

it anywayz... are you applying the old logic of "Germany is screwed up",
"Germany is democratic", "U.S. is democratic -- we MUST be screwed up!"
Cuz that logic doesn't work in real life.. maybe on the net, tho.  TTFN

as saying "Germany is screwed up".. I don't feel this way.. and even if I did
I have no evidence to support it.. I was merely using the points that
TAZ supplied.. maybe some of you knew that.. but I just thought I'd clear
it up so I don't get flamed by every German on the list.. TTFN!

^^^ Was your msg really so munged when you got it? Or did you modify it.  The msg I sent out was: as well as a few form problems and missing >'s
watchful eye and meddling fists.. and I suggest we all fight the
govt's current plan for the NII.  I also suggest that if their current
plan [or one very like it] passes and the spooks are wired in to the
complete net [or even parts of it] that we [cyperpunks, anarchists, businessmen, hackers, and everybody else who doesn't like the govt's
hand in all of this] simply DON'T USE IT.  We can use it's capability
to transport msgs via an encrypted link.. and service providers can
spring up all over the place offering PRIVATE communication.  Luxery
is now becoming a word for things other people don't want you to have.
The "luxery" of privacy is a falacy.  I think one day, maybe soon, people
will simply realize: "Shit!  I don't have to do that if I don't want to!"
Hopefully many people will think this around the same time and we'll
be well on our way.  TTFN.

who he says he is.. or who THE LIST tells us he is.. Now, I am not
paranoid against THE LIST, but I suggest that THE PEOPLE should
not filter THEIR thoughts.  What of censorship [on an aside, is there
a censor apprenticeship?  Why the 'ship?']!?  If you must censor.. censor your own messages with filters running on your own machine..
maybe even publish your filter list to the net so we can all understand
each other.  Remember that there will always be a percentage of noise
in any public forum.. there is no average without these outliers.  For a group SO interested in RANDOM numbers, some people sure do want
to organize everything.  TTFN.

only had your reply to go on.  It's ok to confront.. |-]
trust THE LIST.. which is also fine.. but it does leave a gap.
[note: this filter approach is similar to the Clipper chip in that
       it provides a [possibly] false sense of security -- if people
       want to filter what they see, trust in themselves and don't
       filter what other people see]
Well.. unless the filters are willing to let all messages that
are from people NOT registered with THE LIST thru.. every msg saying "VERIFIED AUTHOR WITH LIST DATABASE" then fine..
but don't FILTER it.  will be no more work for you.
on some remote location is ludicrous.
In conclusion. . .  away.. for everyone.  Why don't we make the solution available to
everybody, not make the solution for everybody.
Nice chatting, Robert.  I'm sure I'll be seeing more.  TTFN.

think they are.. and that is why I do my own authentication, when I can.
If I trust the machine to do it for me, then I've just shot two large
holes in my objective. [THE LIST database could me tampered with;  The
PGP sigs could be forged from the start]
they are either anonymous or a forger.. even forged posts are
sometimes important.. See my other posts regarding LIST authentication,
not filtering.

if your documents are spinning somewhere in v-space then you've lost
one piece of security: The Physical Lock.  If any organization DOES
find a way to break the code, then they can easily go thru the public
archive and read EVERYTHING.

was the following.
copies of the same [private] key.  Then you encrypted each copy of the
key with a user's public key.  Now each user has a copy of the private key.
If you decide Joe SHOULDN'T have access to the data anymore, you can
re-encrypt the document and redistribute the p/k encrypted copies of the
key.  There may be some fancy algorithms to achieve more security.. and
ease of use.. but that's the answer I came up with.  TTFN!

The above "testimony" is meaningless.  How is NIST supposed to know
what diabolical plans NSA/etc has in store for us.
That's MANDATORY . . it won't work if it's voluntary.
is safer than PGP or it's offspring? Why does the government feel
the need to spend all our money and provide us with inferior encryption? ANSWERS:  1] They're lying to us.
It's too bad people, in general, believe what they hear, not what is done.
The Master Plan to hypnotize our nation [+the world?] into supporting
what they have not a clue about continues . . .
