One of the few articles on First Monday that doesn't make me bust out
laughing. (The second one was by Tatsuo Tanaka about the macroeconomic
effects of digital cash, however much I disagreed with his conclusions...)
The fact that I edited both had *absolutely* nothing to do with that
opinion of course. :-).
Seriously, I didn't have any real idea how chains of remailers worked until
I read Sameer's paper for publication, and, to this day, it is, by far, the
clearest explanation of how they work that you can find anywhere.
About a year later, I got roundly bitch-slapped on this list by Mr. May one
afternoon about what a silly liberal-relativist academic navel-gazing
exercise First Monday had become by that point, if it wasn't one from the
outset, and, upon some reflection, I agreed, resigning my founding
editorial board seat there sometime shortly thereafter. It was quite
flattering to be put on the "masthead" of the first "peer-reviewed journal
of the internet", or whatever. Looked nice on the resume, certainly. Not
that anyone needs a resume, anymore, now that Google goes back to 1981...

I'm sorry for laughing, Tim, because, having met you and John, I like you
both very much. However, the above round of name calling on your part is
funny to read -- laughing out loud funny -- coming from you.
Face it Tim, at this point -- if it was ever really much else, even when
what was said on this list had an actual effect on the world -- most of us
here on cypherpunks just are middle-aged old farts with nothing better to
do than sit around a moribund email list fulminating at the world and each
other. The rest of us are either the recently unemployed (or permanently
unemployable by choice. Those that aren't students, graduate or otherwise,
trying to solve the all the problems of the universe with simple
technological solutions. Sometimes, they're even people thinking they're
going to come here and learn about cryptography after discovering, for the
first time, what the social consequences of its use might be. Of course,
those people, especially those with paying jobs, won't stay too long,
unless they fit in the other categories, grouchy old fart, starry-eyed
student, or is-it-shelled-mister layabout.
As for paranoid schizophrenia, Tim, least Dr. Nash's beautiful mind won a

Ahhhh... Would that that were truly so.
It would have made both our lives so much easier over the last 7+ years
(cf. previous bits about crufty old farts with nothing better to do...) if
you actually *did* use that Eudora filter feature, or whatever System X
Mail does these days.
But you never actually do it, do you?

Prosperity through punishment
Retribution can breed cooperation.

Notions of fairness may outweigh selfish considerations.
) Corbis
Cooperation can flourish if the public-spirited majority can punish
freeloaders, say Swiss economists. People will pay to punish - suggesting
that their notions of fairness outweigh selfish considerations. The work
may help explain why people cooperate in society.
In an investment game with shared profits, players punish those who do not
contribute to the group's good, despite the personal cost. The emotional
satisfaction of dispensing justice seems to spur them on: "People say, 'I
like to punish'," says Ernst Fehr of the University of Zurich.
The fear of being fined keeps potential defectors in line, and the power to
punish gives willing cooperators a sense of security. These dynamics may
explain why early humans banded together into cooperative groups for
hunting or warfare.
Explanations of cooperation have tended to focus on what the altruist gets
out of it, either through the swapping of good turns or the benefits to
family members. "For a very long time in economics and biology there's been
an assumption of self-interest," says economist Herbert Gintis of the
University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Instead, he says, it seems that
egalitarianism is "a basic part of human behaviour".

old stomping grounds, "if we lived here we'd be home now", and all that: If
Sharon said it, there are enough people who hate his guts in the mainstream
press that we'd have heard all about it by now.
There ya go. *That* makes a whole lot more sense, now, doesn't it? "Never

or whatever Pournelle said.
But then, a good thing never lasts, does it?, viz,

Someday, what we call "currencies" will be mere indices of various assets.
Look ma, no fiat-state numeraires...
Think of a combination of Fama/Black, et. al's early 1980's notion of "new"
monetary economics coupled with an index of (bearer-held :-)) assets in
transit and in wearhouses, along with commodities, plus the usual equity
and debt mixture. Pretty much what the fed does now, only the index will be
sold, just like the S&P is now.
When IBUC's site's back up, I'll point to an essay I did on it a couple of
years ago...
