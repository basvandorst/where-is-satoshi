we gave the universe one out- if grant found a job he loved before springtime wed stay put even though we wanted to go to cali really bad and even though grant had been looking for a different job for a long time
remember how i was so proud that my room was clean and i was knitting well i still am i swear nothing makes me happier than a peaceful space and some needles women who have these hormonal issues typically carry alot of weight around the middle (due to the out of control insulin and resultant too high of testosterone) and a high protein and fiber diet combined with low carbs really helps with that an added benefit is that these types of foods are so filling and you avoid the highs and crashes that people with blood sugar problems live by
i love all the sweet artistically talented bloggers that offer free downloads around holidays for us readers from anthro
me um we didnt have disney games when i was five
cate (incredulously) what were you a child of adam and eve
i think they are so cute i love her litte handwriting and she is beyond excited to pass them out some other projects she and i looked at but didnt get around to (of course) from martha (of course)
and then that got me thinking that really its not just while laying in bed that she is watching out for me feeling so inspired
it transported me back in time to simpler sunnier days and its been making really happy to stare at today
i went to the fabric store tonight in search of prints to make some new spring scarves with some will probably end up in the shop too i just love this look also i love toast (the catalog and the cooked bread)
messes are piling up around me making it hard to relax and get well i cant cuddle grant or cate- they need to stay well- so they are steering clear of me i am bored and tired and achy
