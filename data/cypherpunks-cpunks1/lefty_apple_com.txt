Actually, this has always been true.  It's just that it was done in the
form of patch resources internal to the System file prior to the release of
System 7.1.  It used to be that, in order to save disk space, one could go
into the System file with ResEdit and remove the various 'PTCH' resources
that didn't apply to the particular machine you happened to be using.
The System Enabler scheme is simply a somewhat cleaner method of
accomplishing the same thing: you now have a "generic" System file, with
the various hacks segregated in the Enabler.

Kirk "I Can't Believe It's a Law Firm!" Sheppard astounds me by posting
Immaterial.  What on earth does "like a book" mean?  Do you contend that
only works printed on paper can have copyright protection, or only works
which are sold in bookstores, or only works which are bound in signatures?
As a trivial counterexample, movies broadcast over cable and songs played
on the radio retain copyright, without any question or doubt.  They aren't
"disseminated like a book", either.
Are you suggesting that there is any connection whatsoever between the
ability to copyright a given work and some third party's willingness to pay
for it?
Are you claiming that if I write a book and decide to give copies away
rather than sell them that my work is thereby not copyrighted?  If so,
you're clearly and without any doubt whatsoever in error.
Are you _positive_ you're a lawyer?
Aha.  This would explain why there's no legal problem with my recording the
complete works of the Beatles off the radio and then reselling them, no
So, let's see here.
Let's say, for the sake of argument, that I'm Stephen King.
I write a book, using a word processing program on my computer, and saving
the results to a magmeto-optical disk.  Is it copyrighted?  Clearly, it is.
I sell the book to a publisher, who prints it onto paper, sews the paper
into signatures, binds it between covers, and sells several million
instantiations of this book to B. Dalton's.  Is it still copyrighted? Clearly, it is.
THe publisher takes a copy of my magneto-optical disk, adds some support
software licensed from Voyager, Inc., and presses a CD-ROM version of my
book.  Is it still copyrighted?  Clearly, it is.
At the same time, I distribute several long sections of the book, via
email, to a private mailing list of friends.  Is the book still
copyrighted?  Clearly, it is.
OK, now, here's the tough one.  I give one of my friend's permission to
post a long (i.e. clearly too long to constitute "fair use") section of
this book to rec.arts.books, with a copyright notice prominently displayed
at the very beginning of the posting, i.e.
          Copyright (c) 1994 by Stephen King.  All rights reserved.
You claim that this posting, suddenly and magically, no longer enjoys
copyright protection.  On what basis?
To approach this issue in another way, I wonder whether you're familiar
with "Internet Talk Radio", a scheme wherein voice broadcasts can be done
over the Internet.  If I were to pay the appropriate fees to ASCAP to allow
me to broadcast a song by Pearl Jam over Internet Talk Radio, are you
claiming that Pearl Jam's copyright to _their_ _own_ _music_ would be
destroyed by _my_ having played it back over this medium?  This would
clearly seem to be your contention.
I think you need to give this a wee bit more thought, Kirk.

Please feel free to identify the "ad hominem attack" to which you're
referring.  I _have_ questioned your claim to be an attorney, largely
because I do not believe that anyone could manage to pass a bar exam while
being so utterly ignorant of the basest rudiments of copyright law.
I found no logic in your postings.  This explains, I think, my inability to
follow it.  I suspect that there are other explanations for _your_
inability to follow, or respond to, _my_ assertions.
No!?  How is it, then, that _I_ can copy a movie legally from HBO but I
can't legally sell the tape to you, eh?
None of which has anything, specifically, to do with copyright.
Do you understand the concept of "intellectual property" in the least?

So you claim.  How does it differ, though?
I have "provided" my postings to Usenet, for the personal use of Usenet
subscribers.  By providing my postings to a particular distribution
mechanism, I implicitly give permission for them to be redistributed _via_
_that_ _mechanism_.  I _do_ _not_ give permission for them to be repackaged
and resold via another medium, any more than David Byrne has given me
permission to resell cassettes of his music by allowing it to be broadcast
on the radio.
And, hence, they have permission to distribute it over the medium of cable
televison transmission.  This does not, in and of itself, give them the
right to, for instance, resell laser disks of the movies they broadcast.
An author doesn't _need_ an agreement to assert copyright.  Were you,
somehow, ignorant of that?
Quite correct.  The CD-ROM manufacture may _read_ them.  Period.

Jon 'iain' Boone asks:
Subscribing to this sentiment does not, in any way, shape or form, require
one to start handing out podia and bullhorns to anyone who has an opinion
to express.
Put it this way: I own a Macintosh, a copy of PageMaker and a laser
printer.  Should I let anyone who wants to use _my_ equipment to produce a
newsletter?  In particular, should I allow a person whose views I consider
to be heinous and reprehensible to use _my_ equipment to produce a
newsletter espousing those views?
To me, the obvious answer is "Of course not".
Does this mean that I'm censoring that person?  Does it make me an opponent
of "free speech"?  No, and no.
I will certainly defend his right to produce a newsletter.  I will
certainly defend his right to buy, and use, _his_ _own_ equipment to
produce a newsletter espousing whatever opinions he likes.
People, _please_ learn what "censorship" is!  If I submit a manuscript to

Some nobody writes
and then treats us to what he purports to be Mr. Nalbandian's phone number
and address.
While I would be willing to bet that my opinion of Mr. Nalbandian is not
the least bit higher than that of anyone else on the list, I can't say I'm
much impressed with the dedication to personal privacy manifested by the
above-quoted nobody.
"Privacy: it's for everybody.  Well, everybody I _agree_ with, who hasn't
pissed me off too much recently..."
Whoever you are, nobody, you're a hypocrite and a coward.  As utterly
bereft of intelligence, cluefulness and common decency as Mr. Nalbandian is
(and make no mistake: he _is_), in my book you are easily ten times worse.
At least Mr. Nalbandian is forthright enough to be clueless in such a way
that offended parties can respond to him directly.  You, on the other hand,
are no better than the sort of hapless fuck who writes the phone numbers of
women who have refused to go out with him in men's room toilet stalls, an

Certainly the use of an anonymous remailer in and of itself it doesn't make
one either a coward or a hypocrite.  However, invading someone's privacy by
posting their telephone number and home address is a hypocritical act for
anyone who expects others to respect their own privacy.  Moreover, doing so
anonymously is cowardly.
And, yes, my using my long-standing nickname, "Lefty", is _quite_ different
from posting anonymously.  You can reply directly to me using my email
address, , which appears in the header of everything I
post; moreover, I am responsible for what I post using that ID.

It is not the case that anybody "pointed out a privacy lapse" here.  On the
contrary, someone _committed_ a privacy lapse by obtaining and posting Mr.
Nalbandian's phone number and address _specifically_ as an incitement for
people to harass him.  This _is_ an invasion of privacy.  Are you somehow
failing to see that?
What you have supplied represents an invasion of privacy as well, in my
opinion.  If you were to explain how you came by this information, _that_
might be worth sharing, but simply presenting a mapping of anonyms to
truenyms is not.

Would it be your position then, that, say, any woman who doesn't happen to

written in a toilet stall in Grand Central Station with the notation "For a

(If indeed it is the same Sorry, but we clearly disagree here.  I view it as a clear incitement to
harassment, and, in my opinion, _that_ constitutes an invasion of privacy.
No.  Privacy is, or should be, the right of all.  I don't have to do
anything special to enjoy my rights to free speech or free assembly.  I
should not have to take special measures to enjoy my right to privacy,
If I don't lock my front door, that doesn't imply that anyone can walk into
my house.  To do so would _still_ be an invasion of privacy.
This misses the point entirely.  Even the indigent have a right to privacy.

Not at all.  It would, however, forbid me from posting his home address and
phone number to the net with the notation "This son-of-a-bitch sold me a
lousy pizza!  Feel free to phone him at five a.m."
Er, file a harassment or stalking suit against _whom_, precisely?
"Hey!  Two wrongs _do_ make a right!"
I don't view it as being germane to the matter at hand.  I do feel that
posting copyrighted material via an anonymous ID is wrong.
Do you claim that a person without an unlisted number has no right to
privacy as far As the phone is concerned, then?
Oh, well, that makes it just fine, then.
Here's where we differ.  By failing to include his home phone number and
address in his postings, I believe that Mr. Nalbandian _did_ make "the
slightest effort".  If he had included them in his sig, for instance, I
would agree with you.
What if he had only signed his first name, but included his last name if
you were to finger his account?
I think it's that "all but" that we're stuck on here.  By your reasoning,
anyone whose phone number can be derived by anything short of illegal means
is "all but handing it out".

According to what I learned in our "Managers and the Law" class, in
California, for something to constitute "sexual harassment" it must satisfy
the following criteria:
It must be unwelcome (in the eyes of the complainant).
It must be offensive (again, in the eyes of the complainant).
It must be sexual in nature.

Thank you for clearing this up; I think it's severely overdue.
I've tried to gently point this out when it came up, but there was never a
_shred_, _scintilla_, _iota_, or _atom_ of evidence that Mr. Nalbandian,
although an extreme dope, was in any way involved in the mass unsubscribing
of a few weeks ago.
I mean, fun's fun and all, but many people on this list are carrying
personal paranoia to an, in my opinion, unhealthy extreme.  Moreover, the
willingness to point at a supposedly guilty party on the basis of no
evidence whatsoever does not speak well of the commitment of many here to
any of the commonly accepted principles of a free society _other_ _than_
that of privacy.  Presumption of innocence?  Reasonable doubt?  Any of
those things ring a bell?
I would even go so far as to suggest that those who have cast blame in Mr.
Nalbandian's direction should apologize to him.
