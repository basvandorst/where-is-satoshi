@_subject: ad: An offer you can't refuse....... 
Would a free vacation be enough to convince you to save some money every month?  What if I threw in free airfare too?
All you need to do is go to:
Check the Best Rate Calculator, and then choose the  lowest rate 1+ (no lengthy access number, no busy signals) long distance service provider you can get!  They have lots of other great telecom 'stuff' too.
That's it. Now go get your free vacation and free airfare:
Still not enough incentive?  Need another reason to lower your phone bill?  How about if I also throw in a free 500-channel satellite dish with free installation?
Isn't this an offer you can't refuse??  (Even if you DON'T want to lower your phone bill, you can still use the free stuff -- there is no obligation.)

P.S. Cognigen is also a great business opportunity -- no cost EVER to be an agent.  Massive passive residual income. You could send this same ad.
