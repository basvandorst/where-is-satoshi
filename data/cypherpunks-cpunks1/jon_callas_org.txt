MUNICH, GERMANY,
27 Sep 2001, 2:46 PM CST
 A group of U.K.-based hackers has cracked computers at the AlShamal
Islamic Bank in Sudan and collected data on the accounts of the Al Qaeda
terrorist organization and its leader Osama bin Laden, Kim Schmitz, a
flamboyant German hacker/businessman, has claimed.
Schmitz, who has offered a $10 million reward for the capture of bin Laden,
told Newsbytes that the information has been turned over to the FBI. Bin
Laden, a millionaire Saudi exile whose base is now Afghanistan, is
suspected of being the driving force behind the deadly Sept. 11 attacks on
the World Trade Center and the Pentagon with hijacked planes.
Newsbytes could not confirm Schmitz's claim. An FBI spokesman in Washington
declined to confirm or deny the story, saying that the agency's policy is
not to comment on information and leads it is receiving.
"We have received a lot of information on this case," he told Newsbytes.
"Of course we appreciate the leads we are receiving from the public, but we
cannot confirm what specific information has been provided to us or by
Schmitz, 27, a former teen hacking prodigy who spent time behind bars
before starting a successful data security business, has been accused of
being press hungry. He says his recent strong anti-terrorism pronouncements
are not a PR prank, but stem from his strong desire to wipe out terrorism.
He says he has received death threats from the Middle East.
The bank Schmitz claimed was hacked was mentioned Wednesday by Sen. Carl
Levin, D-Mich. during a Senate Banking Committee hearing. According to CNN,
Levin referred to a 1996 State Department report that said bin Laden had
provided the AlShamal Islamic Bank with $50 million in start-up capital.
Schmitz told Newsbytes that he could not provide details about what hackers
found in AlShamal Islamic Bank's computers or about the hackers themselves.
Nonetheless, he provided Newsbytes with the following outline of what he
says happened.
Last week, Schmitz, who lives in Munich, posted letters on his Web site
rallying politicians to the cause of fighting terrorism and offering his
hacking expertise.
"I received plenty of e-mails from hackers around the world offering their
services," he said.
Schmitz founded a group that numbers around 23 hackers called "Young
Intelligent Hackers Against Terror." He calls the group YIHAT, which is
similar to the word Jihad, which is Arabic for Holy War.
Schmitz said that last Friday, a Sudanese banker sent the group an e-mail
after reading about the $10 million reward, informing the group that Al
Qaeda and bin Laden have accounts at AlShamal Islamic Bank.
A team of U.K.-based hackers sprang into action, and hacked the nameserver
of AlShamal Islamic Bank, he said. They were able to gain access to the
bank's intranet by exploiting a "checkpoint firewall 1 vulnerability," he
After bypassing the firewall, the hackers achieved "superuser" status on
the server, and "sniffed" eight valid user IDs, and then were able to
collect information on accounts of Al Qaeda and bin Laden.
"This information was sent to the authorities in the USA," Schmitz said.
Schmitz sent the following e-mail to the Webmaster at the AlShamal Islamic
"dear webmaster of sudans shamalbank,
"your bank has been hacked. information regarding Al Qaeda's and bin Ladens
accounts have been captured. all information reached the US authorities.
thanks for using products from checkpoint (firewall1).
"have a nice day, Kim "Kimble" Schmitz, Founder of "Young Intelligent
Hackers Against Terror" YIHAT"
When asked which authorities received the information from the hackers,
Schmitz said: "FBI."
He said that authorities had not given the hackers a "green light" to
undertake the hacking, that the group had done so on its own initiative.
Schmitz said the U.K.-based hackers wish to remain anonymous.
"I am the spokesperson of the group," he said. "They don't want to be
involved with the press. What they do is illegal, unless we find a
government that legalizes our activities."
And somewhat mysteriously, he added: "If I would deliver details about the
hacks, I could get arrested. I am not hacking myself, because that is
illegal. I must keep myself out of the details to make sure that I am still
able to offer them the communication platform they need to fight as united
hackers of the world against terror."

I think it even goes further than that.
I was giving one of my DMCA-vs-Security talks while l'affaire Sklyarov was
roiling, and noted that while that was going on, the US was being testy with
China over alleged espionage by US nationals while in China. At a high
level, each of infringement and espionage can be described as:
Alice gives Bob some information. Bob is careless with it, disclosing it to
someone that Alice would rather not see it. Alice has a non-linear response.
You can call it infringement or you can call it espionage, but at the bottom
of it, Alice believes that a private communication has been inappropriately
disclosed. She thinks her privacy has been compromised and she's stomping
angry about it.
At the risk of creating a derivative work, you say pr-eye-vacy, I say
pr-ih-vacy. Infringement, espionage, let's call the whole thing off.

But OpenPGP does. Here's an extract fro RFC 2440:

    An implementation MAY accept or use a Key ID of zero as a "wild      or "speculative" Key ID. In this case, the receiving implementation

Now, there has been much discussion about how useful this is, and  there are other related issues like how you do the UI for such a  thing. But the *protocol* handles it.

Hash: SHA1
I took a look at it. Amusing. I didn't spend a lot of time on it. Probably not more than twice what it took me to write this.
It has an obvious problem with known plaintext. You can work backward from known plaintext to get a piece of their "tumbler" and since the tumbler is just a big bitstring, work from there to pull out the whole thing.
The encrypted Karacell file format has 64 bits that must decrypt to zero. Since encryption is an XOR onto a pseudo-one-time-pad, this leaks 64 bits of the tumbler. Similarly, the "checksum" at the end is a bunch of hash blocks of their special hash all XORed together. This doesn't work against malicious modificationp; you can cut-and-paste through XOR, etc.
There are obvious vulnerabilities to linear and differential cryptanalysis. It is a lot of XORing on large-ish fixed longterm secrets with only bit-rotating through the secrets, and between the vulnerabilities of known plaintext as well as the leaks in it, I don't see a lot of long-term strength. I bet that you can use known structure of plaintext (like that it's ASCII/UTF8, let alone things like known headers on XML files) to start prying bits out of the tumblers and you just work backwards. But beyond that, it isn't even particularly fast. Since it needs a lot of bit extraction and rotations, I doubt it would be as fast as AES on a processor with AES-NI instructions. The whole thing is based on doing 16-bit calculations and some bit sliding; I don't expect it to be as fast as RC4 or some of the fast estream ciphers.
Obviously, I could be missing something, but there are other errors of art that lead me to think there isn't a lot here. For example, if your basic encryption system is to take a one-time-pad and try to expand that out to more uses, zero constants are errors of art. You should know better. There are similar errors like easily deducible parameters that give more known plaintext. The author discusses using a text string directly as a key, which is very bad with his expansion system. He invented his own "message digest" functions, and they look like complete linear functions to me. They're in uncommented C that's light on indenting and whitespace. Confirmation bias might be making me miss something, but it's not like he made it easy for me.

There is no such thing as plausible deniability in a legal context.
Plausible deniability is a term that comes from conspiracy theorists (and like many things contains a kernel of truth) to describe a political technique where everyone knows what happened but the people who did it just assert that it can't be proven, along with a wink and a nudge.
But to get to the specifics here, I've spoken to law enforcement and border control people in a country that is not the US, who told me that yeah, they know all about TrueCrypt and their assumption is that *everyone* who has TrueCrypt has a hidden volume and if they find TrueCrypt they just get straight to getting the second password. They said, "We know about that trick, and we're not stupid."
I asked them about the case where someone has TrueCrypt but doesn't have a hidden volume, what would happen to someone doesn't have one? Their response was, "Why would you do a dumb thing like that? The whole point of TrueCrypt is to have a hidden volume, and I suppose if you don't have one, you'll be sitting in a room by yourself for a long time. We're not *stupid*."

That's precisely what we mean.
The crypto is the easy part. The hard part is the traffic analysis, of which the worst part is the Received headers. Everyone should look at their own headers -- especially people on this list and at least comprehend that your email geotracks you forever, as it's all in the Mailman archive.
There are plenty of other leaks like Message-ID, Mime-Version, X-Mailer, the actual separators in MIME part breaks, and so on. It's absolutely correct that some combination of VPNs, Tor, remailers of whatever stripe, and so on can help with this, but we're all lazy and we don't do it all the time.
What we're learning from Snowden is that they're doing traffic analysis -- analyzing movements, social graphs, and so on and so forth. The irony here is that this tells us that the crypto works. That's where I've been thinking for quite some time.
Imagine that you're a SIGINT group trying to deal with the inevitability of crypto that works being deployed everywhere. What do you do? You just be patient and start filling in scatter plots of traffic analysis.
The problem isn't the crypto, it's SMTP.

I consider delivering a zero-day to be a form of cryptanalysis. I believe that they do, too. I've been harping on that for some time.
I recognize that I have a tendency to be glib in one sentence and then rigorous in another and that's a character flaw. It's glib to say both "the crypto works" and "zero days are cryptanalysis" in many respects.
When I say, "the crypto works" I mean the basic structures. We know how to build block ciphers. We figured out hash functions a few years ago. We understand integer-based public-key cryptography well enough that it gives us the creeps. We kinda sorta understand ECC, but not as well as we think we do. I think our understanding of ECC is like our understanding of hash functions in 2003. Meow.
The protocols mostly work, except when they don't. The software is crap. It's been nearly fifteen years since Drew Gross enlightened me by saying, "I love crypto; it tells me what part of the system not to bother attacking."
Look at it anthropicly. We know the crypto works because the adversary says they're looking at metadata. To phrase that differently, they're looking at metadata because the crypto works! Look at things like Fishbowl, even. It's easy to get dazzled by the fact that Fishbowl is double encryption to miss that it's really double *implementations*.
The crypto works. The software is crap.
Think like the adversary. Put yourself in their shoes. What's cheaper, buying a 'sploit or cracking a cipher? Once you start buying 'sploits, why not build your own team to do them yourself, and cut out the middleman? Every other part of the tech world has seen disintermediation, what makes you think this is different.
On the other end of things, there's traffic analysis. We have seen -- stuff -- from them over the last decade. Papers on social graph analysis, pattern analysis. Emphasis on malware, validation, and so on. Here's another analogy. Imagine that you're looking at a huge, fantastically complex marching band. You're trying to figure out who all is doing what to what parts of the music and it's horribly complex. And then accidentally one day, you lose the audio feed and then realize that it's *easier* to tell what the band is doing when the sound is off.
Aphasiacs are (so I am told) good at telling truth from lies because they look at the face rather than listen to the voice. They analyze the metadata, because they can't hear the data and it works *better*.
Traffic analysis is what you do if your feed from the marching band loses its audio. It's what you do if you're aphasiac -- which is *exactly* what happens when the crypto works, by the way.
Thus with a large budget, you do both. With one hand, you crack the crypto by cracking the software. When it works it works. When it doesn't, it doesn't. Stop stressing. With the other hand, you revel in the glory of silence. In silence you can think. You watch the band, you watch square dance. You just watch who is pairing with whom, where the lines cross and the beats are. Sometimes you can even guess the tune by watching the dance (which is also cryptanalysis).
And all of that is why the problem in email isn't the crypto, it's SMTP.

I believe that when one is on a team, the more senior one is on the team, the more one has the responsibility to discuss the *team* decision even when one's opinion was different. Actually, *especially* when one's personal decision was different. Every decision has reasons for and reasons against. One's job as a senior team member is to talk about the way one came to the decision for, and not about the reasons against.
I just had a short conversation with Mike Janke about this issue and this discussion, and with his leave I'm going to go against my normal beliefs.
Silent Circle is Mike's vision. He did physical security in a variety of countries and saw that people who are expats from anywhere in anywhere else have a lot of issues they have to face that are all secure communications. Moreover, these people are told "no" all the time (don't use Skype, don't use Gmail, don't trust SMS, don't use cell phones, landlines) and never "yes." The initial vision of Silent Circle was to give those people a "yes." There are (were) three pillars of that vision to give people yesses -- voice/video/etc., texting etc., and email etc.
When I wrote that the email was "something of a quandary," that means that Mike was always for it and I was always against it. I see the other side of it and believe that something that's email-like is essential. We have an architecture for how we're going to grow texting into "messaging" and that will be email-like with true end-to-end security for internal mail. It is a ways off. There are lots of things to work on, from user experience to syncing across devices -- each with real security.
In the meantime, what do the users do? We did a lot of talking to end users, and what they want and need is more than just internal email. They need it to be connected to the Internet. Part of the use case includes that someone wants to send a subscriber a PDF of an insurance form, rental agreement, or so on that the subscriber needs to print out, sign, scan, and send back. A number of them said that what they really wanted as much as anything was an email system run by people who give a damn about security as much as the crypto itself. Whatever that means.
Mike was (and is) a happy customer of one of the existing secure email systems for years, understood its limitations and thought that a useful system could be made out of a conventional email infrastructure augmented by PGP Universal. I was on the other side. PGP Universal is designed for a different use case, a different threat model, blah, blah, blah. You've heard me say it, so I won't repeat it.
When I rationally looked at the facts of the situation, Silent Mail's proposed security was *different* than other secure email systems, but similar. If someone uses it "securely" then it's very good, and when they use it "conveniently" it isn't worse than any of the other convenience-minded secure email systems. Moreover, and getting to the real brass tacks here, Mike's the boss. It's his dream and his money funding it. As an interim system to have, it isn't that bad.
Additionally, one of my bugaboos about security is something I call "security arrogance." Security arrogance is when the security person tells the users what their threat model should be. It's closely related to another thing I talked about a decade ago that I called "the security cliff" -- you start with no security and to get to security, you have to climb a cliff rather than ascend a ramp in that you can't stop halfway up. I believe that one of the ways we security people shoot our clients in the foot is to focus on the ways that security is imperfect and thus argue that less-than-perfect security is worse than no security.
Okay, fine. Hoist by my own petard. Silent Mail, ho!
I'll also add that other team members were of course, spread all over the essential quandary here from thinking it was wonderful to being conflicted to thinking that Silent Mail was worse than nothing.
Development-wise, we had some plans to improve Silent Mail -- specifically, one of the tasks was to make a network widget that would scrape offending headers out of SMTP. However, note that we're a startup. Life is not a zero-sum game, but development is. Every iota of effort that's spent propping up SMTP is an iota that's not going to making its replacement. This ended up being a different sort of quandary. The people who accepted Silent Mail warts and all (or shock, horror liked it) like the idea of the new "messaging" system even better. Thus, propping up SMTP didn't really have any champions, and it's not like we have people sitting around doing nothing. We all considered Silent Mail to be a stop-gap.
Let me fast-forward up to the day before we shut Silent Mail down. One of the major requests that we had was to split the suite of products up. We were working on precisely that. (And it should go live next week.) In fact, we were *discussing* a breakup of the suite even before Silent Mail went live, and we noted that it became a legacy product after being up for about a week.
As there was more and more news about state-sponsored espionage (China, Countries Starting With The Letter 'I', etc.), we got more "business" customers and they were as a rule not interested in secure email that was not under the direct control of their own IT. Post-Snowden, the people who thought, "It's good enough" became fewer. The proportion of users who were using Silent Mail was about 5% of the total.
Every account has a page where you set up your devices, and there's a link to click to set up Silent Mail. Only people who clicked that link got set up, and the 5% number is the people who set it up, so that's obviously an upper bound of people using it.
We had been discussing shutting it down -- that 5% figure is either an argument for why it just isn't succeeding as a product, or an argument why the people who are using it understand it and its limitations. It was a discussion item for our September BoD meeting. My plan was to suggest we stop taking new orders and subscription renewals as part of the suite break-up, and then just let it fade away. I was, in fact, lobbying hard for that. I believe I would have prevailed at the board meeting, but of course I'd think that.
Your suggestion about making it be internal-only was something I'd be willing to compromise on. However, remember that much of the whole *point* of Silent Mail is that it's a well-run Internet Email System.
Now let's get to the day we shut it down. I had been at the VoIP conference, ClueCon, in Chicago. As luck would have it, I finished up early and failed to get standby on an early flight home. Others of us were scattered with other travel. One of my major thoughts was what if there's paperwork on its way, and that paperwork doesn't know I'm in an airport lounge? When I finally got Mike on the phone, he said, "You did the right thing. I'm glad you're my partner." Interestingly, the guys who work for me told me after that they had decided that they would delete things themselves if things went on for another couple hours.
I know this has been long, so let me sum up answers to your questions:
* Silent Mail was always a debate between perfect and good enough. It was even a debate over what it means to be good enough.
* The people who thought it was good enough don't think like you and me, and I think their point of view has it's own validity.
* The people who wanted it wanted it to be an Internet Email System above all. Even in the design of the new thing, it has to be connected to the Internet so that someone on the Internet can send you an email. Pulling back to being internal-only would not meet the goals of the people who wanted it.
* We're a startup. We only have so many resources, and no one was the champion of making Silent Mail better. The people who thought it was good enough didn't see the point in making it better, and the people who thought it wasn't good enough didn't see the point either.
I hope this helps explain.

Development-wise, we had some plans to improve Silent Mail -- specifically, one of the tasks was to make a network widget that would scrape offending headers out of SMTP. However, note that we're a startup. Life is not a zero-sum game, but development is. Every iota of effort that's spent propping up SMTP is an iota that's not going to making its replacement. This ended up being a different sort of quandary. The people who accepted Silent Mail warts and all (or shock, horror liked it) like the idea of the new "messaging" system even better. Thus, propping up SMTP didn't really have any champions, and it's not like we have people sitting around doing nothing. We all considered Silent Mail to be a stop-gap.
Let me fast-forward up to the day before we shut Silent Mail down. One of the major requests that we had was to split the suite of products up. We were working on precisely that. (And it should go live next week.) In fact, we were *discussing* a breakup of the suite even before Silent Mail went live, and we noted that it became a legacy product after being up for about a week.
As there was more and more news about state-sponsored espionage (China, Countries Starting With The Letter 'I', etc.), we got more "business" customers and they were as a rule not interested in secure email that was not under the direct control of their own IT. Post-Snowden, the people who thought, "It's good enough" became fewer. The proportion of users who were using Silent Mail was about 5% of the total.
Every account has a page where you set up your devices, and there's a link to click to set up Silent Mail. Only people who clicked that link got set up, and the 5% number is the people who set it up, so that's obviously an upper bound of people using it.
We had been discussing shutting it down -- that 5% figure is either an argument for why it just isn't succeeding as a product, or an argument why the people who are using it understand it and its limitations. It was a discussion item for our September BoD meeting. My plan was to suggest we stop taking new orders and subscription renewals as part of the suite break-up, and then just let it fade away. I was, in fact, lobbying hard for that. I believe I would have prevailed at the board meeting, but of course I'd think that.
Your suggestion about making it be internal-only was something I'd be willing to compromise on. However, remember that much of the whole *point* of Silent Mail is that it's a well-run Internet Email System.
Now let's get to the day we shut it down. I had been at the VoIP conference, ClueCon, in Chicago. As luck would have it, I finished up early and failed to get standby on an early flight home. Others of us were scattered with other travel. One of my major thoughts was what if there's paperwork on its way, and that paperwork doesn't know I'm in an airport lounge? When I finally got Mike on the phone, he said, "You did the right thing. I'm glad you're my partner." Interestingly, the guys who work for me told me after that they had decided that they would delete things themselves if things went on for another couple hours.
I know this has been long, so let me sum up answers to your questions:
* Silent Mail was always a debate between perfect and good enough. It was even a debate over what it means to be good enough.
* The people who thought it was good enough don't think like you and me, and I think their point of view has it's own validity.
* The people who wanted it wanted it to be an Internet Email System above all. Even in the design of the new thing, it has to be connected to the Internet so that someone on the Internet can send you an email. Pulling back to being internal-only would not meet the goals of the people who wanted it.
* We're a startup. We only have so many resources, and no one was the champion of making Silent Mail better. The people who thought it was good enough didn't see the point in making it better, and the people who thought it wasn't good enough didn't see the point either.
I hope this helps explain.

That's precisely what we mean.
The crypto is the easy part. The hard part is the traffic analysis, of which the worst part is the Received headers. Everyone should look at their own headers -- especially people on this list and at least comprehend that your email geotracks you forever, as it's all in the Mailman archive.
There are plenty of other leaks like Message-ID, Mime-Version, X-Mailer, the actual separators in MIME part breaks, and so on. It's absolutely correct that some combination of VPNs, Tor, remailers of whatever stripe, and so on can help with this, but we're all lazy and we don't do it all the time.
What we're learning from Snowden is that they're doing traffic analysis -- analyzing movements, social graphs, and so on and so forth. The irony here is that this tells us that the crypto works. That's where I've been thinking for quite some time.
Imagine that you're a SIGINT group trying to deal with the inevitability of crypto that works being deployed everywhere. What do you do? You just be patient and start filling in scatter plots of traffic analysis.
The problem isn't the crypto, it's SMTP.

I consider delivering a zero-day to be a form of cryptanalysis. I believe that they do, too. I've been harping on that for some time.
I recognize that I have a tendency to be glib in one sentence and then rigorous in another and that's a character flaw. It's glib to say both "the crypto works" and "zero days are cryptanalysis" in many respects.
When I say, "the crypto works" I mean the basic structures. We know how to build block ciphers. We figured out hash functions a few years ago. We understand integer-based public-key cryptography well enough that it gives us the creeps. We kinda sorta understand ECC, but not as well as we think we do. I think our understanding of ECC is like our understanding of hash functions in 2003. Meow.
The protocols mostly work, except when they don't. The software is crap. It's been nearly fifteen years since Drew Gross enlightened me by saying, "I love crypto; it tells me what part of the system not to bother attacking."
Look at it anthropicly. We know the crypto works because the adversary says they're looking at metadata. To phrase that differently, they're looking at metadata because the crypto works! Look at things like Fishbowl, even. It's easy to get dazzled by the fact that Fishbowl is double encryption to miss that it's really double *implementations*.
The crypto works. The software is crap.
Think like the adversary. Put yourself in their shoes. What's cheaper, buying a 'sploit or cracking a cipher? Once you start buying 'sploits, why not build your own team to do them yourself, and cut out the middleman? Every other part of the tech world has seen disintermediation, what makes you think this is different.
On the other end of things, there's traffic analysis. We have seen -- stuff -- from them over the last decade. Papers on social graph analysis, pattern analysis. Emphasis on malware, validation, and so on. Here's another analogy. Imagine that you're looking at a huge, fantastically complex marching band. You're trying to figure out who all is doing what to what parts of the music and it's horribly complex. And then accidentally one day, you lose the audio feed and then realize that it's *easier* to tell what the band is doing when the sound is off.
Aphasiacs are (so I am told) good at telling truth from lies because they look at the face rather than listen to the voice. They analyze the metadata, because they can't hear the data and it works *better*.
Traffic analysis is what you do if your feed from the marching band loses its audio. It's what you do if you're aphasiac -- which is *exactly* what happens when the crypto works, by the way.
Thus with a large budget, you do both. With one hand, you crack the crypto by cracking the software. When it works it works. When it doesn't, it doesn't. Stop stressing. With the other hand, you revel in the glory of silence. In silence you can think. You watch the band, you watch square dance. You just watch who is pairing with whom, where the lines cross and the beats are. Sometimes you can even guess the tune by watching the dance (which is also cryptanalysis).
And all of that is why the problem in email isn't the crypto, it's SMTP.

============================== START ==============================
I believe that when one is on a team, the more senior one is on the team, the more one has the responsibility to discuss the *team* decision even when one's opinion was different. Actually, *especially* when one's personal decision was different. Every decision has reasons for and reasons against. One's job as a senior team member is to talk about the way one came to the decision for, and not about the reasons against.
I just had a short conversation with Mike Janke about this issue and this discussion, and with his leave I'm going to go against my normal beliefs.
Silent Circle is Mike's vision. He did physical security in a variety of countries and saw that people who are expats from anywhere in anywhere else have a lot of issues they have to face that are all secure communications. Moreover, these people are told "no" all the time (don't use Skype, don't use Gmail, don't trust SMS, don't use cell phones, landlines) and never "yes." The initial vision of Silent Circle was to give those people a "yes." There are (were) three pillars of that vision to give people yesses -- voice/video/etc., texting etc., and email etc.
When I wrote that the email was "something of a quandary," that means that Mike was always for it and I was always against it. I see the other side of it and believe that something that's email-like is essential. We have an architecture for how we're going to grow texting into "messaging" and that will be email-like with true end-to-end security for internal mail. It is a ways off. There are lots of things to work on, from user experience to syncing across devices -- each with real security.
In the meantime, what do the users do? We did a lot of talking to end users, and what they want and need is more than just internal email. They need it to be connected to the Internet. Part of the use case includes that someone wants to send a subscriber a PDF of an insurance form, rental agreement, or so on that the subscriber needs to print out, sign, scan, and send back. A number of them said that what they really wanted as much as anything was an email system run by people who give a damn about security as much as the crypto itself. Whatever that means.
Mike was (and is) a happy customer of one of the existing secure email systems for years, understood its limitations and thought that a useful system could be made out of a conventional email infrastructure augmented by PGP Universal. I was on the other side. PGP Universal is designed for a different use case, a different threat model, blah, blah, blah. You've heard me say it, so I won't repeat it.
When I rationally looked at the facts of the situation, Silent Mail's proposed security was *different* than other secure email systems, but similar. If someone uses it "securely" then it's very good, and when they use it "conveniently" it isn't worse than any of the other convenience-minded secure email systems. Moreover, and getting to the real brass tacks here, Mike's the boss. It's his dream and his money funding it. As an interim system to have, it isn't that bad.
Additionally, one of my bugaboos about security is something I call "security arrogance." Security arrogance is when the security person tells the users what their threat model should be. It's closely related to another thing I talked about a decade ago that I called "the security cliff" -- you start with no security and to get to security, you have to climb a cliff rather than ascend a ramp in that you can't stop halfway up. I believe that one of the ways we security people shoot our clients in the foot is to focus on the ways that security is imperfect and thus argue that less-than-perfect security is worse than no security.
Okay, fine. Hoist by my own petard. Silent Mail, ho!

Thanks for your comments, Ian. I think they're spot on.
At the time that the so-called Arab Spring was going on, I was invited to a confab where there were a bunch of activists and it's always interesting to talk to people who are on the ground. One of the things that struck me was their commentary on how we can help them.
A thing that struck me was one person who said, "Don't patronize us. We know what we're doing, we're the ones risking our lives." Actually, I lied. That person said, "don't fucking patronize us" so as to make the point stronger. One example this person gave was that they talked to people providing some social meet-up service and they wanted that service to use SSL. They got a lecture how SSL was flawed and that's why they weren't doing it. In my opinion, this was just an excuse -- they didn't want to do SSL for whatever reason (very likely just the cost and annoyance of the certs), and the imperfection was an excuse. The activists saw it as being patronizing and were very, very angry. They had people using this service, and it would be safer with SSL. Period.
This resonates with me because of a number of my own peeves. I have called this the "the security cliff" at times. The gist is that it's a long way from no security to the top -- what we'd all agree on as adequate security. The cliff is the attitude that you can't stop in the middle. If you're not going to go all the way to the top, then you might as well not bother. So people don't bother.
This effect is also the same thing as the best being the enemy of the good, and so on. We're all guilty of it. It's one of my major peeves about security, and I sometimes fall into the trap of effectively arguing against security because something isn't perfect. Every one of us has at one time said that some imperfect security is worse than nothing because it might lull people into thinking it's perfect -- or something like that. It's a great rhetorical flourish when one is arguing against some bit of snake oil or cargo-cult security. Those things really exist and we have to argue against them. However, this is precisely being patronizing to the people who really use them to protect themselves.
Note how post-Diginotar, no one is arguing any more for SSL Everywhere. Nothing helps the surveillance state more than blunting security everywhere.

I am separating this from my previous as I went into a rant.
As we were designing Silent Text, we talked to a lot of people about what they
needed. I don't remember who told me this anecdote, but this person went over
to a colleague's office after they'd been texting to just talk. They walked
into the colleagues office and noticed their phone open with a conversation
plainly visible with someone else. A third party who was their mutual
colleague was texting about that meeting.
In short: Alice goes to Bob's office for a meeting and sees texts from Charlie
about that meeting, including comments about Alice.
There wasn't anything untoward about the texting. No insults about Alice or
anything, but there was an obvious privacy loss here. What if it *had* been
included an intemperate comment about our Alice? Alice said nothing about it
to Bob, but I got an earful. That earful included the opinion that the threat
of accidental disclosure of messages within a group of people is greater than
either the messages "being plucked out of the air" or seizure and forensic
groveling over the device. Alice's opinion was that when people have a secure
communications channel, they loosen up and say things that are more dramatic
than they would be otherwise. It's not that they're more honest, they're less
honest. They're exaggerated to the point of hyperbolic at times. Alice said
that she knew that she'd texted some things to Bob that she really wouldn't
want the person she'd said them about to see them. They were said quickly, in
frustration, and so on. It's not that they'd be taken out of context, it's
 that they'd be taken *in* context.
It's interesting underlying the story, Alice suddenly saw Bob not as an ally
in snark, but a threat -- the sort of person who leaves their phone unlocked
on their desk. Bob, of course, would say something like that if the texts had
been potentially offensive, he'd have locked his phone. This explanation would
thus convince Alice that Bob is *really* not to be trusted with snark.
This is incredibly perceptive, that the greatest security threat is not the
threat from outside, it's the threat from inside. It is exactly Douglas
Adams's point about the babelfish that by removing barriers to communication,
it created more and bloodier wars than anything else.
That's where "Burn Notice" came from. It's a safety net so that when Charlie
texts Bob, "I'm tired of Alice always..." it goes away.
What I find amusing is the reaction to it all around. There's a huge
manic-depressive, bimodal reaction. Lots of people get ahold of this and
they're like girls who've gotten ahold of makeup for the first time. ZOMG! You
mean my eyelids can be PURPLE and SPARKLY? This is the same thing that happens
when people discover font libraries or text-to-speech systems. For a couple of
days that someone gets the new app, there's nothing but text messages that are
self-destructing, purple, sparkly eyelids with font-laden Tourette's Syndrome
with the Mission Impossible theme song playing in the background. (Note, if
you are using Silent Text, you can't actually make the text purple, nor
sparkly, nor change fonts. You need to put all of that in a PDF or an animated
GIF -- and you will. This is a metaphor, not a requirements document.)
The next thing that happens is that they are so impressed with some
particularly inspired bit self-desctructing childishness that they take a
screen shot. As they gaze at the screen shot, or sometimes just as they take
the screen shot, light dawns. Oh. You mean.... Oh. Then the depressive phase
kicks in.
Back in the dark ages, PGP had the "For Your Eyes Only" feature. This is
pretty much the ancestor of Burn Notice. Simultaneously useful and worthless.
It's useful because it signals to your partner that this is not only secret
but sensitive and does something to stop accidental disclosure. It is utterly
ineffective against a hostile partner for many of the same reasons. We did all
sorts of silly things with FYEO that included an anti-TEMPEST/Van Eck font,
and other things. Silent Text actually has an FYEO feature that isn't exposed,
thank heavens.
I mention all of that because once you're in the depressive phase, it's easy
to go down the same rathole we did with FYEO. I spent time researching if you
can prevent screen shots on iOS (you can't). I did this while telling people
that it was dumb because I can take a picture of my iPhone with my iPad. I
held up my phone to video chat and said, "Here, see this? This is what you can
Sanity prevailed, but I think that fifteen years of FYEO helped a lot. When
you stare into self-destructing messages, trying to figure out how make them
really go away flawlessly, they stare back. You will end up trying to figure
out how to do a destructive two-phase commit, what class libraries need to be
patched so those that non-mutable strings inherit from mutable strings (not
the other way around), all while a nagging voice whispers in the back of your
head about how brave freedom fighters are gonna die because of this.
After the depressive phase comes the patronizing, retributive phase in which
it's clear that letting people delete potentially embarrassing messages is
bad, because it's imperfect. Imperfect security is worse than plaintext.
People have to learn self-control. Cue the Kalil Gibran quotes. People can't
just say any old thing on a secure chat program because that leads to purple
eyeshadow and thus inevitably to brave freedom fighters having their phones
seized at borders, and then people will die -- all because we let them delete
their incriminating messages. This phase makes so little sense that it's hard
for me even to mock it. But the gist of that objection really is that it's bad
to let people delete sensitive things because that will cause seizure of
sensitive things. Otherwise sane people have said this to me, and they don't
seem to see how funny they are.
Nonetheless, there's two things that happen. On the one hand, there are people
who think this cute, simple feature is the second coming of sliced bread. The
other hand is the people who insist it must be impossible (because they've
over-thought it) or evil (because security shouldn't be fun, let alone
purple). There is a small point to the dour, greyfaced side of this, I admit.
You cannot solve human problems with technology. Technology often just
shuffles around the brilliance that humans have at shooting themselves in the
foot. I'm well aware of Laotse's snarky comment that the invention of locks
created burglary, and I often agree with him.
But I think there has to be fun with security. We talk a lot about how
security has to be usable, but I think fun is up there, too. If it's fun,
people will use it. They make their mistakes cheaply, and in a reasonably safe
environment. Most of all, they'll actually use it. That's been the challenge
of the last couple decades, getting people to use it. People use things that
they play with. I think thus that play is part of security, too. What's
"groundbreaking" in what we're doing is that we're having fun and encouraging
others to do so, too.
