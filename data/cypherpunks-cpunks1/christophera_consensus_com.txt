I hope not -- one thing that I'm trying to do by taking over support for
RSAREF is make it much more responsive to what developers demand. Like you
I was disappointed by the slow progress of RSAREF, so that is why I worked
so hard to get this deal going.

As you may know, Jonathan, who is an active member this list, has already
written about Consensus' intention to continue to upgrade RSAREF. We'd like
to help make sure that RSAREF stays in sync with SSLREF as we upgrade it.
For instance, the next major release of RSAREF will be encrypting the
private key (which now has to be done outside of RSAREF.)
One area in particular we could use some feedback on from you:
Currently SSLREF makes 4 calls that are not in the published program
interface of RSAREF. These calls are DES_CBCInit, DES_CBCUpdate,
RSAPublicEncrypt, RSAPrivateEncrypt. With your license with RSA for RSAREF
you are allowed to go under the published interface by using the DES
routines only for securing the channel, and the RSA routines are limited to
endpoint authentication only.
SSLREF 3.0 developers only to use RSA's BSAFE rather than the less
expensive (or at least, no up-front fee) RSAREF.
What Consensus Development would like to do is extend the RSAREF API such
that RSA's concerns as regards direct access to those routines is taken
care of, and can be called by non-PEM/non-Mail applications such as SSLREF.
We need to extend the API for PGP, so ideally anything new we add to the
API should be general purpose as possible, yet also deal with RSA's issues.
BTW, to explain RSA's issues regarding the RSAREF API: Consensus is
contractually required to get prior approval before licensing RSAREF for
any program that goes underneath the published API. This allows RSA to make
sure that these routines are not used in patented ways that RSA does not
have rights to. In designing new API and getting them to sign off on the
new API allows us to offer licenses to anyone without getting RSA's prior

It certainly can be built from RSAREF, as I use my Apple DigiSign X.509 key
(ultimately created with TIPEM in the Mac system software) with RIPEM/Mac
(which uses RSAREF.)
Some additional info: my company, Consensus Development, has commercial
rights to license developers RSAREF also has a good relationship with
VeriSign. We helping them writea variety of tools to make issuing X.509
certs easier.
I've been working on getting RC2/RC4 in object-only exportable size key
form from RSA for RSAREF customers, and Jim Bidzos has agreed in principle.
We have to work out details, however.
I spoke with Eric yesterday and I think he was working on some ASN.1
related classes for a future version of SSLeay.

@_subject: Fwd: RSAREF dos not give you access to RSA 
Just an FYI, Consensus Development (not Consensys) can only offer a
commercial licenses to RSAREF. Some such licenses we can grant waivers to
user lower-level routines -- to date we've granted waivers for SSL and PGP
compatible software.
The problem is that only RSA Labs (not RSA Data Security) can offer this
permission (as they have all the non-commercial rights) and they are not
set up to handle such requests.
I'll see what I can do as the commercial licensee to influence making this
happen. RSAREF was released "to support standards" and SSH is a beginning
of a standard, so I think it should be possible.

@_subject: SEAL cipher info requested (something actually list related!) 
To all that keep telling me to use Applied Cryptography -- I have the book
already (an autographed copy ;-)
What I am seeking is more than what is in the book:
  * are there are any links on the web to SEAL?
  * is IBM actively marketing it?
  * what precisely is patent?
  * for how long?
  * has anyone currently licensed it?
  * has anyone tried attacking the algorithm?
  * should we be (the community) be looking at SEAL
    for standards (say as an alternative to RC4?)?
  * is there something better then SEAL available?

@_subject: SEAL cipher info requested (something actually list related!) 
I also am interested in references to it.
I'm told that it was invented by a cryptographer at IBM, and that it
patented, so that should help in the search.
