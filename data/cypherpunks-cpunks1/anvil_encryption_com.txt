Dear Sir,
We are producing the national television series .com hosted by Star Wars  celebrity Mark Hamill.  The series airs nationally on CNBC and the Bravo  Network and is all about the Internet and how it is changing the way we do  business.  We are reviewing storylines and Web Sites to be featured in our fall  programming.
 We have featured stories on digital Imaging including Kodak, on-line banking  with Digital Insight, and Healthful On Line Web Sites such The American Heart  Association as well as many others.  Please take this time to complete this brief questionnaire and we will consider  your story and Web Site as a feature on the show.  If the story or Web Site fits  our programming requirements, one of our producers will contact you.        There is a pre-production fee to participate on the show which offsets some of  the pre-production costs, however we pay for all of the production and post  production costs.
 Please allow us at least one week to review your response and your web site,  Thank-you.
 Patty Elliot
 Vice President, Programming
