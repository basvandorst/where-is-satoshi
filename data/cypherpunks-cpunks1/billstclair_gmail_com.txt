@_subject: [gsc] Trubanc Web Client Public Beta 
I've been working since late July on Trubanc, an anonymous,
digitally-signed vault and trading system. Inspired by Patrick
Chkeroff's Loom.cc, but with digital signatures for security. The
first version of a web client is available for beta testing. Check it
out. Send me email to get a coupon with the usage tokens you need to

Protocol description: Protocol and database details: Client database details: Source viewer: Git archive: It's open source. Please review for security if you're inclined and  Mine is a US-based testing and development server only. Hopefully,
servers with real assets, hosted in financial-privacy-respecting
countries, will follow shortly, maybe run by some of you.

@_subject: Participate in Dept of Homeland Security discussion (fwd) 
Security Review begins TODAY! Join the conversation at
Somehow I doubt they'll appreciate my perspective:
1) Completely eliminate the Department of Homeland Security
2) Remove all infringements on the right to keep and bear arms and
return to the homeland security the founders envisioned, the
unorganized militia.
It would be hard to even state my perspective at their site. It splits
the problem up into umpteen components, and expects you to comment on
them individually, assuming that their compartmentalization of the
problem is the only possibility.

@_subject: Euro project to arrest us for what they think we will do 
"Minority Report" comes to the real world. I predict that if they do
this, the lampposts will be decorated with politicians who MIGHT
support this kind of thing.

Yawn. We fought this battle ten years ago. PGP won.
Well, Ms. Caproni, which is it? Will we have strong encryption, or
will you be able to see plain text? I know which technology I'm going
to use.

I wouldn't trust OnStar to shut down the data collection. I'd make
sure there's no data to collect:

@_subject: Google Wallet Security 
I haven't seen details on how this works, but from the short
description on that Wikipedia page, which matches Google's
description, the PIN enables the NFC antenna, which allows the "Secure
Element" chip to communicate over the NFC radio link. The NFC station
can then query the Secure Element for the user credentials, which I
assume are sent encrypted with the credit card issuer's public key. So
you'd have to send transmission over the NFC radio link's limited
range that looks to the Secure Element to be coming from a credit card
issuer. Hopefully, the encryption between the credit card issuer and
the Secure Element is end-to-end, so there's no way for anybody else
to snoop on it. So if you can steal the PIN, hack the OS to simulate
that PIN being typed, while the user is close to an NFC station that
can impersonate a valid credit card issuer, you're golden. Sounds hard
to me.
Lots of guesses there, however. I hope Google will publish the
protocols. Maybe they already have. I didn't look.

If he flies his $5K toy over my property, I'll gladly spend a dollar's
worth of bird shot to shoot it out of the sky. That goes double for
gummint spy drones.

Wow. A whole journal issue taking seriously the marketing hype about
"Homeland Security", as if it were what it claims to be instead of
simply a power grab by a bunch of tyrants. Amazing.
