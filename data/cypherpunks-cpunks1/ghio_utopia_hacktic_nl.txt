: Please keep me informed of your progress.  Does anyone out there have a : somewhat comprehensive listing of these or other implementations : already ported to Linux?  I am intending on setting up an alternative : site for folks with nosey or suppressive employer accounts or private : university accounts who desire an anonymous account somewhere else.
I have used deslogin and ctelnet with Linux
: In that same spirit, does anyone have pointers to Linux specific security : implementations.  I would also be interested in ported implementations of : remailers, or other annonymity protecting services.
All the remailers that I know of work with Linux.
Here's a list of crypto apps that I know will run under Linux:
mixmaster v2
Stuff I'm not sure about:
Anything else?

This is a configuration problem at the remailer, most likely a missing randseed.bin file.

A better approach would be to encrypt the entire IP packets and leave the
framing bytes alone.  But this is what I do:
I use regular unencrypted SLIP (slirp) between here and netcom.
Also install copies of slirp in all your other unix accounts, plus your
favorite session encryption daemon (deslogin, ctcp, ssh, esm, etc).
Then make some script files like this.  For this example I use deslogin
to establish a secure session with utopia.hacktic.nl.
dip /root/netcom.dip
dip /root/utopia.dip
exec /usr/local/bin/deslogin ghio at utopia.hacktic.nl
port ptyqf
wait ogin: 60
send anything\n
wait d: 5
send password\n
wait ] 5
send \n
send exec slirp-0.9o/src/slirp\n
get $rmtip 10.0.2.42
get $locip 10.0.2.16
mode CSLIP
Add to /etc/hosts:
10.0.2.42       utopia-secure
Then I can do: telnet utopia-secure
and everything is encrypted.
I got deslogin from utopia's anon-ftp dir.
A 3DES version would be nice tho.
When you want to hangup, use this to kill all of the dip processes:
ps -ua|grep " pQf "|awk '{print "kill " $2}'|csh
ps -ua|grep " pS1 "|awk '{print "kill " $2}'|csh
To do this for more hosts, just pick any available IP addresses
in 10.0.2.x and a free tty (ttyq* are usually unused).
