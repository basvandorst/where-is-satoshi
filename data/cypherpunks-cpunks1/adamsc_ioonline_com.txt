I think the numbers have escaped you:  there are far more Macs than Unix
machines.  It doesn't matter that Unix has a larger market with
universities or Internet weenies, merely that overall more people use
Macs than Unix. Also, FWIW some of those Unix machines are Macs running
A/UX (Apple's Unix).
One last thought: Sun, Dec, SGI, etc all make RISC Unix machines.  Apple
is the largest RISC vendor on the planet...
Given that the Amiga is still around (and may be revived) despite the
fact that the Mac:Amiga ratio is probably the same as the PC:Mac ratio,
I'd say that it's quite likely Apple will stay around.  Inspite of the
hype about loses, Apple posted tens-of-millions-of-dollars profits last
quarter - rare for a dead company...   They still cannot meet the
demand for the PowerBooks - probably the best notebook available at any

easy to observe them entering it, etc. 2) Most parents need the kid to
keep the computer working. They a) don't have the knowledge/skill to keep

@_subject: Opiated file systems 
What I was trying to propose was that you provide a key for usage when
they first initiate usage of your site. They could then use that key to
send stuff to you. Neither party needs to know who the other person is,
merely that he is using the agreed upon key. This would let you revoke
the keys of offenders.
I'm assuming most remailers allow 2 way traffic. Alternately, just send
email to the remailer operator. Rather than get spammed by the
bounceback, he would probably block that site from sending to you... (Or
revoke their account entirely)
I was using PGP as an example. If you really want portable, use that Java
PK library and write a custom frontend for it.  You just need to use an
agreed upon key for verification. Now, if they wanted, a secure method
might be using PK-aware remailers - pk channel from you to remailer,
using your keys, pk channel from remailer to them, using their keys. This
would let you exchange a key securely... Of course, it would involve
trusting the remailer operator, but you'd have to do that anyway.

Induction would be a good choice.  Hmmm, how about using the house water
pipes? (Or heater ducts?) Not only should they conduct water, it does
offer the possibility of some VERY funny hiding spots.  If you were
seriously worried, you could even waterproof the drive (Enough epoxy and
almost anything can be waterproofed ) and power it off of a turbine in
the water pipe!  I imagine hiding it in a septic tank would probably
discourage searchers as well... Finally, I'd have a duress code (or
emergency button or timer ... etc) wired up to a thermite charge. Might
be a bit permanent, but certainly would come in handy.  (hmmm. Wire it up
behind an access panel in a heater duct. Set it so there are something
like 15 screws that need to be unfastened to get to it, including some
elsewhere. If it's done in the wrong order, WHOOSH)
Oh, and did I mention that putting it in a (metal) duct or pipe would
probably be enough to tempest shield a drive? (As I understand it,
monitors are the least secure part of the system, followed by cpus.)  In
fact, it ought to be enough to throw off a metal detecter/search device
as well. You could even leave a crudload of old MFM drives (20MB! wheee!)
in similar spots as decoys... Put things like encrypted copies of the
constitution, large scans of 4th ammendment plaintext, etc, on those...
Ought to be at least irritating and it might be interesting to have them
have to read that into record at a trial as well...
BTW, I'd try a fiber-optic connector to the machine because 1) it's
waterproof and you wouldn't have to be quite as paranoid about leaks, 2)
it's far more secure, 3) it's faster and 4) it's probably impossible to
trace like a metal wire (i.e. run current through and trace magnetic
fields...). Put it in the usual snarl of wires (Cable TV, telephone -
multiple lines of course, home intranet, etc) and it could be really
nasty. Finally, if it was wired up on a home network, you could protect
by carefully choosing your network architecture, hopefully getting one
that allows hidden devices (i.e. only shows up on access attempts,
perhaps only w/right password.)

A) Only accept files with valid PGP signatures from accepted keys - this
is one area where PGP's commandline interface is a plus - just write a
batch script. Demand that a separate file be sent first, signed by a
certain key. This file would contain valid filenames for the rest of the
session. If a non-listed file is sent, kill the session.  This could all
be automated with a simple program. You could probably even use SSLs and
similar to do it on a website if you could swill the PGP bit - maybe a

One, you could probably replace the wires with fiber/xmitter pairs.
However, this would probably screw your timings to hell - SCSI probably
wouldn't work.  OTOH, it's possible that with a careful enough job and
some decent components you could pull it off. It would be incredibly
wasteful, though, as you would need 40+ fibers to do the job of one...
I'd find some network cards that support fiber and breadboard a little
system together. Possibly, you could find a hookup that would work off
the shelf - look for sources for embedded systems. For instance, at least
Novell's networks have embedded system support. I recall a DDJ that had
someone wire up a coffemaker as a network controlled device, so I doubt
you'd need a PC.  As I recall, he had a single chip ethernet device. Now,
this was for regular ethernet, but I'd assume you could connect a fiber
based ethernet over with some sort of adapter.  Search for the article at

This is new? I remember hearing about a case on this end of the continent (west coast)
that involved  a store that had been robbed many times. The owner noticed
that most burglars came through the skylight, so he electrified it. Not
much of a charge, just something like 12 volts - enough to keep someones
hands off of it...  However, a klutzy burglar managed to fall into the
skylight and get stuck.  His partner deserted him.  Over the course of
several hours, he died... *ouch*  Needless to say, his next-of-kin sued
and won. The guy lost his store.
Another one I liked: in (I believe) Pennsylvania, a drunk peed on an
electrified third rail.  His next of kin sued the trolley company and
A man tried to commit suicide in Chicago by jumping onto an El track.  He
was only crippled, so he sued and won!

The most significant would be the presence of a compression header (what
has the data telling how to decompress a datastream). If you leave this in (for
instance, assuming you were to use PKZIP (STUPID!) you would have PK as the first two bytes
EVERY TIME!) you give your codebreaker a HUGE advantage. You can bypass this by removing ANY
information which isn't message specific and standardizing on one compression method.
Alternately, you could use your session key to encrypt a length word and then pad the start (and
end) with a string of random characters.

How about adding an "Oh s___" feature that would dump the key? You could
even tie it to a login attempt (i.e. be sneaky and rename the actual root
account to something else. Possibly hack the login client to return
"root" as the username, etc, etc to complete the illusion if they are
using TEMPEST.  Then set it so that a root login makes the daemon dump
the password)
This would have possibilities, too, if you made it react to a) certain
files in certain directories, b) certain signals or c) certain network
This would allow you to put in an innocous clear signal. Set it to a temp
file created when editing your remailer's configuration (or userlist).
Make it so that you have to conciously DISABLE security or it dumps the
password. Have an innocent program terminate it. Be able to cancel it by
sending an email (or using telnet) - this would be great if you had a
trusted friend.  Also, with some modification, you could set it to react
to an external stimulus - say a panic button? or a card lock?  You could
even have fun putting all your sensitive stuff on an external hard drive
and rigging your panic button to a) stop the remailer and b) activate the
thermite charge on the external drive.

Much easier - with each card, store its ownership history. EACH time it
is transfered, have it be signed by the previous owner.  Originally, the game company signs
it as a valid card. On selling it, they record the purchaser's identity (email address,

Yes. For instance, a photographer should get a release for a photo of a person, particularly if he plans to resell it. It does make me wonder whether you could file a suit against TRW for selling information about you, particularly since it could affect you adversely and there is no guaruntee it is accurate.

It's kind of funny how quickly they dropped out of usage. I'm probably one of
the estimated 7 people under the age of 30 who actually know how to use one. (Long story - it involves a couple months in a math class w/o a decent
calculator)  I was in an Algebra class taught by 'Father Time' - interesting
facial expression when he first noticed my 'calculator' (similar to the one
he got when I blurted out the [correct] answer to a problem he'd been
explaining while I was reading a book and ignoring him - in retrospect, RAH
was more educational).  We had to take some sort of state math test and I had
just gotten my new programable graphing calculator a week or two before (more
lost sleep - with a little creativity and a boring class you can get some
interesting code on those thingies) but for some reason I decided to bring
both calculator (the allowability of which was highly suspect) and sliderule.
 The proctor saw me and had a major fit -- over the sliderule!  Yeap, in the
state of California they don't let algebra students use a sliderule to
'cheat' on the assessment test.  They do, however, allow you to use a modern
graphing calculator with programs and an equation solver (Did I mention the
optional IR link?).
The same thing goes on with SATs and especially SAT-IIs.   Some higher-end
calculators, esp. HPs, have plugin cartridges which automate much of the
basic work in chemistry, physics, etc.  I never saw anyone who used such
things even get asked about it.  Do we even need social engineering with
people this stupid?

Microsoft would probably do anything the USG asked if, say, immunity from the
DOJ was granted under the table.
NTT is also a great choice, as you mentioned above.
IBM, Sun, DG, Cray (a Silicon Graphics subsidiary?), etc. might go for some
free publicity - I've seen a LOT of press releases out of IBM that talk about
"blue-sky" research being done.   Given that IBM lives because of big
business, they also have a demonstratable interest.   I'm sure they'd love to
be able to advertise that the data you trust to DB2 (for instance) is
entirely secure.   The same argument works for DG.  Also, IBM has a lot
invested in chip fabrication facilities - there's got to be some extra
capacity there! Sun has always seemed to be big on tech-demo type things. Cray - well that's obvious.  The supercomputer market is heading toward

OS/2 doesn't claim to be a secure multiuser operating system.  If they have

especially if you've compiled Linux with an encrypting file system.
Microsoft claims C2 or higher for NT and deserves any ragging they get if
it's not.   Ditto for any other vendor who claims one thing and sells

Okay, correct me if I'm wrong on this (as if you wouldn't...):
1. Microsoft markets NT with C2 security
2. Numerous industry magazines report that you can bypass NTFS file security
by booting
    off of a diskette and using NTFSDOS.
3. Numerous industry magazines (and I believe MS finally mentioned it in some
routine status
     update) all say that NT should now be considered C2 *ONLY* on machines
w/o floppy      drives.
Sounds like they weren't quite honest on this one.  Or are you trying to say
that security-by-obscurity (relying on NTFS's then lack of external mounting
programs) was a good choice?
I know that you can get in there.  It just seemed odd that it would be setup
by default...

==================BEGIN FORWARDED MESSAGE==================
Reply-To: "Terry Hamilton"                     REMOTE SUPPORT TOOL FEATURED IN MERLIN
WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA, September 3, 1996 ---  International Software
Solutions has announced that an IBM-only version of their product, Remote
Services Management(TM) (R.S.M.) will be included in OS/2 Warp Version 4
(code-named Merlin).  This innovative tool, called IBM Remote Support for
OS/2, allows IBM service representatives to help users directly over the
phone, much as an on-site Help Desk would.  With the permission of the OS/2
user, a remote IBM service representative can now dial into the user's system,
take control of the keyboard and screen, conduct training, run programs, edit
files and, if necessary, reboot.
IBM Remote Support for OS/2 is a functional subset of R.S.M., which was chosen
by IBM from among several remote control tools. R.S.M. is a full function
product allowing network support and administrative people to take control of
client workstations.  For the general user community, R.S.M. is used for help
desk support, software installation and updating, training, and full access to
an office computer from a remote laptop.  Through an integrated Programming
Script Language, R.S.M. can even be used to build complex LAN and WAN
Management applications. R.S.M. was formerly known as PolyPM/2.
According to Tim Guptill, Senior Vice President of International Software
Solutions, USA, "We at I.S.S. are proud that we have been selected to provide
IBM Remote Support for OS/2 for inclusion in the IBM Assistance Center - OS/2
Warp Version 4.  Now, IBM Technical Support can directly access and control
customer machines to perform Help Desk and diagnostic functions.  This is a
revolutionary step in providing a level of customer support as yet unavailable
in the general software market".
For more information on Remote Services Management, contact I.S.S. at their
toll-free number (888) ISS-2-YOU, GO ISSLP on CompuServe (e-mail 104127,1754),

Actually, if you use only a few bits - and not, say, bit 15 of *every* pixel -
you can feel secure *IF* you are writing truly encrypted data.  A regular PGP
message has a bunch of header material that most certainly is not
random-looking.  OTOH, if you only write the raw data, then there is no way to
differentiate from the random noise added by any scanner - in most cases, the
last couple bits in each RGB triplet of a truecolor image are random.

I'd have to disagree with you on this.   Based on my experience in 3 widely
different districts, such behaviour/problems isn't likely to result from the
school environment.  It's a function of the family life these kids have.   If
they come from a disfunctional family, kids are going to join gangs, get pregnant , use drugs, etc no matter what school they're at.   If they have
the right background, it's not going to happen.  Of course, in some areas (esp. inner cities) the rate of social dysfunction
is extremely high, so some schools are 90% 'problem-kids' as well.   I'd
reccommend against having a homeschooled kid go to one of those (unless
you've been using the Cypherpunks Homeschool Plan For the Instruction of the
3 Rs,  Martial Arts, Bomb-Making, Assasination and Black-Helicopter
Countermeasures.  I imagine school would be very popular if some list members
were teaching)  just because it would significantly reduce the opportunity
for them to catch a stray bullet or something.   I still doubt that a
homeschooled kid from a strong family would join these groups.

really "creative" file systems (The fractal file system - 5 trillion files

I've noticed that many places are concerned more with things like creativity,

resume that shows these kind of traits well overcame the lack of a degree
(I'm working on that). There was a thread about this in comp.lang.cobol
awhile back. The old way was that your HS provided what the mythical average person needed
to go about life. College was for the more "complex" careers.
You don't even need to be that harsh.  Chain-gang work to pay off stolen
property would be more effective, if for no reason other than that you'd get
your money (or property) back.
And you have to look at it from another point of view:   If it would
ameliorate the problems in the future for the majority of the population,
it'd be worth a bit of discomfort now.

love for your neighbor if you can't give him a meal while he's out of work
(assuming of course you have food yourself - although many in the great
depression did anyway).   It's when this kind of activity is state-mandated
that you have this problem.

I recently graduated HS and am at the local community college preparing to
transfer to a 4-year.  Meaningless indicators as follows:  3.9GPA,  1490 SAT
(800 Verbal 690 Math - I haven't had a math course since Trig/Precalc in my
sophomore year - I was 2 years ahead but moved to 2 districts which didn't
even have calculus) - which is up 120 points from my freshman year.
Anyway, as far as what colleges look for, they do care about non-major
classes but don't, obviously, weight them as highly.   As far as the real
world (i.e. employment) goes, many places realize you aren't going to learn
much in 4 years.  They want to see not that you have specific experience but
that you know how to think and especially how to teach yourself.   If you can
show that you can adapt well to market changes you probably won't have to
worry about work...

Now there'd be an almost acceptable use of AP!  I bet Team OS/2 alone would
contribute enough to paste billg. Not to mention what IBM or Sun or Apple or
Lotus or Borland or [company that got screwed] would do. #  Chris Adams    | #  		 | send mail with subject "send PGPKEY"

As far as SMP goes, it's actually not all that expensive.  People in the
linux-smp list have reported differences of as little as $50 for a
uniprocessor vs. dual pentium system.   Of course, every so often we'll get a
message about a $30,000 system that can handle up to 64 Pentium
Pros! #  Chris Adams    | #  		 | send mail with subject "send PGPKEY"

How about a real simple rule:  if you don't pass a standardized test (Call it
the SATs w/800 of 1600 minimum) you repeat the grade -  no maximum age!  Might end some of those "easy A" classes I took.
Yeah.  I'd still say that you'd want to make it pretty easy to switch over - I've known a few people who were massively flip-flopping.  Also, some kids
may have hard times (parents divorce, etc) that might screw up their
judgement for awhile. . .
  That seemed to be the general focus last year...  "We may be idiots but
we have school spirit!"
In CA, isn't there the option of taking CHSPE (sp?)  that is like a GED but
instead of sending the "I don't want this" message is more like "I don't want
to waste my time"?
