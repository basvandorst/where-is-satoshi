Some thoughts on this from a UK/EU citizen perspective:
So, there are 36 data points being collected (as opposed to the 19  bandied about). This is bad but it gets worse - All data (including  topics such as personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin,  political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union  membership, and data concerning the health or sex life of the  individual) is to be transmitted, with the DHS systems filtering this  out. But not really, because it's still accessible in cases of peril  to the individual.
Oh, and the data is kept *active* for 7 years, for analytical  purposes (how many times have you been in the US in the past 7 years?  Did you like the hotel .... ) further, the data is kept in a  *dormant* state for 8 years. Except that the actual manner of  deleting the PNR data is yet to be discussed, so it may not actually  happen. Plus, in the next 15 years, there will be at least two  different presidents, multiple Secretaries of Defence, Homeland  Security and State, a possibly entirely different kind of EU.
As a country we've restricted the suspension of Habeas Corpus to only  28 days. We have the D. P. A. for managing and restricting access to  such personal data. But it's OK if you travel to the US - expect  fingerprints, iris scans, and your family history to be stored on  accessible and semi accessible databases for 15 years.
Our liberties and rights get eroded, just a little bit, every day.  Soon we'll be lucky to have a name rather than just an identity.
