Dear cypherpunks;
In the last few days I have received numerous email coming from you but with
fake return addresses from messages posted on newsgroups.  I must have been
targeted because I am a bulk emailer.  Letting you know now that I am a
legitimate bulk emailer compiling my list with the permission of each account
If this barrage of email does not cease immediately, I will be forced to take
legal and maybe not so legal actions to defend myself.
If you would like to discuss this further, please call me at 407-438-8892.

Did you know this company is using your email address as part of
an unlawful email bomb?
I would advise you to write to them at cypherpunks at toad.com
and owner-cypherpunks at toad.com and advise them to stop
using your email address for this type of activity.
It is illegal to use a invalid return email address.  If this continues, I
be forced to prosecute the return email address - which they are
making to look like you.
Below is the letter that I received in my email box
