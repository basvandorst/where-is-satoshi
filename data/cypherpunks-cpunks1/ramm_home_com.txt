Can you please advise on the following:
We are considering moving back to England from Canada and have the following
2 cats approx 8 yrs old where their vacc are up to date
1 cat approx 4 yrs old who as above is up to date with vacc
Also 1 puppy who is now only 10 wks and doesn't have his rabies vac for a
few more weeks yet
Can you please advise what the procedure would be and if they would have to
be quarantined or not
Thanks for your help
