Basic Flaws in Internet Security and Commerce
We believe that the current focus on secure session-layer protocols and
sufficient randomness have obscured more fundamental flaws in end-to-end
security. In particular, secure end-to-end transactions require two parts: a
secure protocol to communicate over untrusted channels, and trusted code at
both endpoints. The latter problem has received less attention, but destroys
security regardless of the quality of the protocols or of the random numbers.
We have implemented a series of related attacks utilizing IP spoofing:
   *  We can spoof NFS to patch binaries on the fly if we are on any subnet
     between the NFS client and NFS server. We used this to turn legitimate
     Netscape browsers into versions that used a fixed key (known only to us),
     thus invisibly eliminating security.
   *  The same trick allows us to defeat Kerberos security by attacking kinit.
   *  We can also spoof NFS file-handle lookups, so that we can replace any
     file (such as .login) with another file that runs with root access
     privileges (even if the requesting user cannot).
These work because the trusted path to executables is really not trustworthy in
most environments. Although we use on-the-wire patching to compromise
executables, the client binaries can also be compromised during download, by
on-the-wire patching of FTP or HTTP transfers. Trojan horses and viruses could
also patch the client software after it's on the local disk, especially on
systems like Windows 95 that do not provide access control for files.
Given that these are realistic threats, we believe that these issues must be
resolved before internet security and commerce are realistic.
