There is absolutely nothing new about it. Cypherprankish solution would be
strong anonymity instead of complaining on the basis of popular US mythology
(constitution et al.) and Californian ideology which seems to prevail here.
If you want to make a personal (ie. body-endangering) statement then there are
many fora that can accomodate that.
If you want to discuss an applied mathematical solution that affects meatspace
behaviour (ie. cypher-weapons development) then do it anonymously.
There is really no middle ground.
Fishing for the meatspace fame subjects you to the meatspace rules - and I find
this to be the most serious limiting factor - there is no usable crypto stuff
done by mr. Melon.
Or to make it really simple: who gives the fuck if 50% of active cpunk

DMITRY SKLYAROV: CHIPS SERVED FOR LUNCH IN AMERICAN JAIL
Russian programmer Dmitry Sklyarov is comparing the condition in American jails
with the building group or young warrior courses. "One can't intimidate us with
American jail!",- said Sklyarov.
4 jails - in Las Vegas (Nevada), Oklahoma (Oklahoma), Santa Clair and finally
San Jose (California). In Sklyarov's words, the conditions of American
penitentiaries are similar to the works Sklyarov had to do in the building
group during his student summer holidays or they reminded young warrior courses
in the army. Sklyarov surely said he had to adjust himself like for example
breakfast in the San Jose jail was served at 4 a.m. in the morning, lunch - at
11 a.m. and dinner - at 5 p.m. For his lunch Dmitry had chips (14 grams), 2
pieces of bread with sausage, some other little things and something to drink.
"It is allowed to buy food with your own money if you have any", - Sklyarov
said. If you wish you can work in the jail getting 18 cents per hour, RIA
Novosti informed.
There were 60 people in the cell of the Las Vegas jail where Dmitry Sklyarov
was: the people on trial and those who will have to face the court in the
future. The people were sleeping on two-level bunks, the attitude between the
people was sympathetic and understanding. One of Sklyarovms cell-mates told him
the state was paying $300 daily for each person in jail.
Sklyarov is optimistic about the things that happened to him, he is still
hopeful he will soon see his family. The office of the Russian Consulate
General in San Francisco renders him some help in this respect. The session
devoted to Dmitry Sklyarovms pending case will take place August 23 in San
Jose. The courtms decision will show if the case is over or is going to
develop. Dmitry Sklyarov was released on bail with an obligation not to leave
the territory of North California until there is the final decision made on his
case. He visited the Russian Federation Consulate General in San Francisco on
Thursday. Sklyarov arrived at the office with 2 lawyers. They warned their
client to withhold any comments to the media until the court session takes
place August 23. (of original message)

This just shifting the issue without actually solving it - instead of mint

The basic point here is that:
a) most "public" (including me and the few that I talked with) will not "trust"
money that is pure math, without actual *people* (who can be pulped if
something goes wrong) behind it. Pulpability (in this special meaning) is a key
ingredient in trust - you trust someone that agrees to be hurt if she misuses
the trust. Fuck the math, new advances happen and most do not understand it any
b) The competition (government) will pulp the pulpable mint.
So, n-way blind e-cash will never happen. It may be a nice thing to bullshit

*WHO* do you beat up if they lie ?
If you *can* beat up someone, so can the government.
We are back to the basic fallacy of cyberspace, that somehow crypto and
networks will switch the address space under Men with Guns, so that they will
be left in their own empty pages while we roam the virtual memory.
This is an excellent example why some things need to be addressable in
gov-pages (meatspace) and therefore pulpable.
This is patently false.
If something goes wrong with my account I deal with meat in the bank. In US of A you are not liable for stolen card use. In US of A you can say "no,
I did not withraw this cash" - EVEN IF YOU DID - and bank does not have much
choice - some hoofed cpunks may know the exact case name.
Technology in banking is just a tool, a helper. You can dispute any and all
charges. Cards and ATMs are just tokens and machines with no property or
ownership. Companies behind them, with very well known coordinates, are the
ones you do the business with.
Any e-cash system that has shared address space with Men with Guns will be run
by Men with Guns.
Take, for example, the Anon Mint Insurance Company. How would it assess the
risk in order to determine the premium ? There are *no* established anon mints
and there can be no insurance for anon startup mints(1). Unless you disclose
some meatspace addresses, and then we have MwG, and so on.
It's easy to bring life to moon by providing all support from Earth. But we
have *no* "Earth" in anon e-cash, and MwG will take care that it remains so.
Which is exactly why there is no anon e-cash today.

Cato is the first place that I visit when curious about the current agenda of
the unique mix of libertarian/new world order propaganda.
Translating protesters' agenda to "anti-property" *is* pure propaganda designed
to scare god-fearing middle class cypherpunks that somehow they will lose some
of their property should G8 protesters seize the world government (BTW, it
would be interesting to see what is the net worth of cpunkers and how that
influences their positions :-)
As the word "communist" loses its strength new words are needed to instill
fear, and "anti-property" is a nice catchall. It's all in the language. You also enumerate ideologies with implicit assumption that they are "bad". So
whatever can be labeled "marxist" or "socialist" is somehow horrible. You don't
say WHAT is bad about it, you *assume* that everyone will jump to the bandwagon
and agree that it's something bad. Kill the commies. This is a classic
propaganda technique.
I will not bother citing sources that have exactly the opposite PoV from Cato's
- you can look them up yourself. The point of a discussion is not spamming each
other with pre-digested, ready-to-wear, downloaded simplifications but to
inject some of own experience and induction.

logic of late sixties still holds, few hundred protesters is far below the
Congress influence threshold.
It seems to me that the thesis about the *value* of cypherpunks' enhancement of

far) tend to help "general public" realise what the state of security is (GSM,
802.11, DeCSS, Deep Crack, eBook) and tend to hurt corporations and government.
This charity service *costs* those two a lot - real money is lost because of
it. Replacement of 56-bit DES costs tons of cash and fucks up echelonning. I

It seems that time has come to do some serious interface rethinking.
The advent of WIPO/DMCA ideology and it's steady infiltration into actual
technology is starting to render traditional protection-busting schemes
ineffective. It is or will soon become illegal and also technically difficult
to meddle with hardware/software itself. The demise of general-purpose PC will
certainly not help.
The last frontier is human interface - eyes, ears and fingers (for the time
being and due to failure of  to attract capital these are the only
ones.) All content control breaks at this point - if there is a way to see or
hear, then analog capture cannot be foiled.
There seems to be a lot of misunderstanding about quality of analog capture of
picture and sound. That is to be expected when even dumb headphones are
marketed as "digital" to stupefied public. My experience is that digitizing
audio using standard mac h/w gives quality better than that of average .mp3
stream. There is nothing fundamentally wrong with going through analog stage
with high quality components. And as long as there are wires going into
speaker's amps, this will be doable. And after that hi-fi mic next to quality
speaker will also do the job.
Right now it all seems rather straightforward - even inferior peecee users
should be able to set up things so that audio is digitized while being played
and then converted to .mp3 or whatever.
What I am interested in is how could this be prevented ? What would be the most
effective way to disable analog audio recording and subsequent digitizing ?
What are the signs to look for ? Is there open-source software for digitizing ?
And on the legal side, how much spin would be required to make analog recording
illegal under DMCA ?

Depending on your PPL (personal paranoia level), this may sound as an
boring conspiracy theory or be the reason to stop using things with
transistors in them :-)
(1) Take a block cipher with block size b and key size k. Any block cipher.
(2) Assume that k > b.
(3) Now, if you take a particular input block B (plaintext), and encrypt it
with all possible keys (2**k), a decent cipher should produce output that
covers full 2**b output space, right ? (4) The question is: is there such B that, in process (3) generates output
from which (part of) each key can be trivially inferred ? For instance,
the output is a ROT-13 of the lower b bits of the key, or blowfish encrypted
upper b bits of the key (with the blowfish key being "suckers suckers ").
You get the drift.
(5) is it possible to prove that the answer to (4) is "yes" or "no" ? What
could be learned by doing the brute force test on 56-bit DES for two keys
and trying to find correlation in the resulting 2**57 space ?
(6) If it is impossible to prove that the answer to (4) is "no", what can be
done to prevent the chosen plaintext attack ?
[as for conspiracy, if the answer is "yes", then only two block ciphers need
to have this feature: DES and AES. Easily done and not too expensive either.]

BO, trojans, http tunelling and similar are really not rocket science
these days. 99% of sheeple machines are vulnerable. This is perfectly
valid and real attack. Not on my machines and probably not on yours -
that does not make any difference.
This is just another data point supporting secure devices insulated
from microshit OS, java and wintels in general. Running PGP in the
environment where attachment execution and/or java and/or activex are
tolerated does not make any sense.
And *THERE ARE* tools that offer real protection. Look up iButtons

@_subject: kinds of computation? 
"Trusted" in "devices" generally assumes tamper-proofness (so that, once
certified, the trust is implied the next day, with some p close to 1.)
Brain is on the top of that list, ms windows at the bottom.
The top secrets reside in brain (passphrases), lower-grade secrets
(passphrase-protected) on electrical gadgets. The problem is the capacity
- both storage and computational - which drops as trustworthiness
I think that these tradeoffs are not well understood, too much is assumed.
On average, effective passphrase length is less than 60 bits. Yes, it's hard
to estimate what is the effective length of strings composed from personal
experience and published bits, but I have seen no data that would support
anything more than said 60 bits. So if 256-bit block cipher is at the end of
the security chain tha begins with 60-bit passphrase, why, OH WHY do we
bother ? I mean, even 56-bit single DES in ECB mode will stop all casual
We need to enhance storage capacity of the most trusted environments. This
ultimately leads to implants, with keychain items as an in-between step.

the bad news: the bill in question, the PRIVATE SECURITY INDUSTRY BILL,

The basic problem with cpunks is misunderstanding of the ground rules.
Most cpunks are/were cube slaves, albeit with decent salaries, and some have
cashed out (you know who you are.)
As well-paid hired hands they tend to forget who masters are and how masters
Trying to shove the privacy down the throat of unsuspecting citizenry is an
exercise in futility. Not unlike organising the church of atheists. "Ordinary"
people will do what they are fed with. Cypherpunks have no means of conquering
even 0.001% of the input bandwidth of "ordinary people". There is no money and
no means for that.
So, what is left ?
- Sell out and help various "rights" groups that do good (as defined by USG -
always groups outside US and sympathetic to US) use crypto.
- Sell out and do commercial crypto which will never have any impact on
individual's privacy.
- Sell out and radiate negative vibes and pipe dreams about killing.
The point is, we have not found a killer app that:
a) can be sustained by a small group of disorganised individuals
b) has huge appeal to "ordinary" people.
Remailers satisfy a) but not b), for example.
What looks most promising at the time being are P2P apps that need protection
from snooping. Let's make trading .mp3s a crime with capital punishment.

The only way to protect from living organisms used as weapons (after all - life

this - it's like trying to stop crypto or C coding. Will not happen.
Maybe the high density living that we are so used to is incompatible with new
weapons. Maybe societal structures based on projectile-throwing weaponry are
passe. New weapons always changed rules, and it was called progress.

Targeted bioweapons will offer, for the first time, opportunity to get rid of
"others". The more "others" present a monoculture group (genetically, eating
habbits, behavioural patterns) the easier it will be to target them. In this
regard bioweapons work directly against what was driving force in history so
far - grandfalooning around concepts, feeling safe among the same.
[Think microsoft & windoze - I notice that those using them spend more and more
time fighting plagues than doing some useful work, if they ever did. When was
the last time you saw a macintosh or lynx virus ?]
Some alternate lifestyles will (statistically, by chance) offer some
protection. Not that I know what they may be. Ultimately, when everyone has a
bioprinter*, your only safety will be having as little in common with everyone
else as possible, to raise the cost of creating the custom bug.
And this will bring some profound changes.

@_subject: govt-licensed broadcaster bans songs 
No shit ?
PR dept. docs are now the "proof" ?
Last night when Chatterbox spoke with Jack Evans, a regional senior vice
president of programming at the radio station chain Clear Channel
Communications, he acknowledged that his company had distributed to its
programmers a list of songs with questionable lyrics that stations
should avoid in the wake of the Sept. 11 attack. (Click here for his
original statements on the list, and scroll down for the content of the
list itself.)
Today, however, Clear Channel issued a press release denying the
existence of the list, and the Web site of Radio Ink, a radio industry
trade publication, reported, "Clear Channel confirmed to Radio Ink this
morning that the banned list was only an Internet rumor."
So what's the truth here? Clear Channel admits it distributed a list of
songs to program directors. It obviously wasn't encouraging stations to
play songs like "Another One Bites the Dust." If you read the press
release carefully, it appears Clear Channel is weaseling out of sticky
situation: "Clear Channel Radio has not banned any songs from any of its
radio stations." Right. They didn't ban any songs, they simply asked
that stations not play them. Chatterbox wonders if there's another song
they might want to add to this supposedly nonexistent list: a little
something by the Sex Pistols.
Jack Evans, a regional senior VP of programming at Clear Channel
insisted this list was not an effort initiated by management: "After and
during what was happening in New York and Washington and outside of
Pittsburgh, some of our program directors began e-mailing each other
about songs and questionable song titles," though the finished list was
distributed to the program directors by Clear Channel management.
Evans concedes that some of the songs are off base: "I think there were
certainly songs on the list that people were reading too much into" (the
Beastie Boys' "Sabotage," perchance?) though he supports the list in
general. "There were a substantial amount of songs in question that I'm
glad the [program directors] brought up so we didn't air them at a very,
very sad time." You can judge for yourself. Here's the list, with
original spellings intact.

The principal philosophical issue here is that the ownership of the "computer"
So far most people owned their computers in the sense that they could make

on enemy's territory with all imaginable consequences.
TCPA-ed computer is actually a single-seat movie theatre teleported to your
house. It's operated and owned by one or more corporations - what you pay when
"buying" the computer are up-front installation costs of the franchise.
Remember that theatres are enclosed spaces with entertainment with doors that
you need a ticket to go through.
Sheeple will get more entertainment. The only problem seems to be that small
independent producers will not get their stuff played there. Tough shit. If
small producers want to fuck with all world's theatres, they need to get
better. Parasiting is over. There is no natural right to program other's
machines. When I go to the theatre I don't want unwashed activists flashing

This can be shifted to the information theory terrain.
It's not _just_ about using the straight and prescribed language and
constructs. It is about predictability in general. Most posters that I filter
out are predictable to the point where I can, with decent accuracy, guess what
they will say on any given subject. They can be described (scripted) as finite
automata. And they have enormous integrity that they are proud of.
Bricks also have integrity, but I always failed to find them entertaining -
except maybe when they disintegrate on high impact. Then you get to see many
irregular and unpredictable pieces.
Some aspiring student of AI may find it an interesting exercise to customize
alicebot to emulate some of the most integral cpunk posters (think timbots,
mattbots, etc.) Frankly, I think that it's already been done. Sometimes I think
that there are already alicebot implants.
So it's all about entropy. Low entropy dwellers perceive high entropy ("high on

What will determine the outcome of this war is future availability of universal
openly-programmable computing platforms (aka pee-cees). We will probably see
regulations following those for handguns: for the first few decades everyone
sported them, then they became heavily regulated.

DVDs are probably the first product ever rolled out exclusively for content
control purposes.
Quality-wise, it's somewhat better than VHS and almost the same as Hi-8 (which
I use for archiving purposes), and definitely inferior to analog laserdisc,
which had a thriving market but is now almost extinct (a nice side-effect being
that titles are now available for $5-10 and there are some which will never
make it to DVD).
Hype and brandheads that salivate on words like "dolby" "surroundumb sound"
aside, average consumer got only new expense with DVDs - buying a player.
Like CDs, audio cassetes and IP protocol, VHS will stay forever with us.

Physical number of lines is far from being the only measure of quality.
Compression has a huge impact, and so do other digital artifacts.
For instance, just take a look at the opening scenes (earth rising on the moon
horizon) in Kubrick's 2001 on laserdisc and DVD. In DVD, the dark blue-black
background consists of funny rectangles.
There are also a lot of motion artefacts which give a certain "feel" do DVD
image - but then, that may become fashionable, as valve amplifiers are again
now or listening to dolby-recorded tapes without dolby players - some just like
that boost in the high end.

This bullshit is getting deeper and thicker.
(dis)ability to replay received information at will has next to nothing to do
with ability to stop unwanted parties from obtaining secret information.
Let me rephrase this for stupids:
DRM is about enforcing NDA between me and someone who made information
available to me. DRM is about preventing me to transmit information which
became a part of my experience.
DRM is about who owns my memories.
One *is* the sum of information obtained from the outside world. Information
becomes (a small) part of you. This is why people share songs - they identify
with something there and want to communicate it. THAT'S WHY THEY LIKE IT IN THE
FIRST PLACE. The ultimate DRM is city government stopping you from describing streets,
leased apartment owner stopping you from reminiscing sex you had there, school
suing you from passing on the knowledge learned. Put a newborn in a sensory
deprivation tank and twenty years later observe someone who fully obeys
There is no moderate answer to this. The only possible answer is FUCK YOU.
Privacy is about stopping unwanted from knowing my private bits, bits I share
with my chosen circle of associates and friends.
And guess what - I am not a friend or associate with entertainment publishers.
I am not a member.
Sale of information is always a sale to the group one belongs to. After few
iterations it quickly expands to the whole connected world. So publishers can
choose to (a) become pipes more convenient and faster than information working
its way through degrees of separations or (b) go out of business. In the
meantime a lot of money and maybe some blood will be spent trying to accomodate
sheer greed.

This is naive approach.
Even if we assume that amazon would in *fact* agree to this mechanized
enforcement of corporate policies, and that tcpa owners/creators are not
colluding (open source doesn't mean shit - check the history of pgp
vulnerabilities) and that policies are foolproof (think "bug-free software")
and that amazon is not running SSL proxies in front of its servers on separate
machines (as they probably do now so it's sniffable plaintext inside) and that
there will never be a tap on data/address bus (or is tcpa protecting the whole
RAM somehow ?) and that no one will offer $10000 off-the-screen reading OCR
software with attached device that emulates fingers on the keyboard and reads
the entire database in a week (rent-a-tap ?), even if we assume all that, a
dream where the server *becomes the business* ("amazon" is someone who buys the
domain name and the server), how do you imagine to convey the advantage of all
this to the unwashed masses ?
It is much cheaper and equally effective to run advertizing campaign that
claims that data is secure than to actually implement it in some technological
way which no one can understand.
The first time a braindead exec of e-tailer introduces tcpa/drm the competition
will come up with "tcpa plus" or "ypzd secure" that will sound and feel much
more secure and yet let them sell lists and beat the competition. It works -
most americans believe in magic properties of the greek word "democracy".
The technology, once outside of comprehension of your average sheep, is
irrelevant. It's waste of money.
This proof would require understanding of what tcpa is. All people who do
actually understand that can protect their privacy just fine today without any
additional tcpa needed.

Presuming question, as the rest of the article.
Crypto is there for all those who want to encrypt, accessible as it was five
years ago. And stuff does get encrypted - the real crypto, P2P, not the bogus
one between servers in boiler rooms.
As for argument that OS upgrade game requires live crypto coders to keep up -
that's also bogus. PGP 2.6.3i runs fine on the latest winshit. PGP 2.6.2 runs
fine on latest macs. PGP 2.6.2 compiles under linux and freebsd today (unlike
6.* sources)
And they are being used by those who need them. What, no shiny UI ? Tough shit.
Use plaintext. And shiny UI *did not* make masses use 7.0.3, did it ?
Actually, people have machines with 5-6-7 year old OSes ... because they work.
Especially in end-user interface applications - text editors, mail clients,
telnet/ssh/http, there is no need to upgrade at all.
Virus claim is also bogus.
That is, unless you you use microsoft stuff with 5 months average life span.
You do ? I thought so.
Face it, convenient crypto is an exercise in futility. Convenience is
positioning end users where they are wanted - bent over, pants down, cleansed
by the upgrade enema, ready to receive.
ITAR classification was correct, after all. Crypto is arms. Successful crypto

Whoever taps SMTP/POP3 bitstreams is hardly less-resourced. The only adversary

like microsoft windows' vulnerabilities. To be safe, crypto needs to be
diverse, custom-made and manual. The brain cycles you spend when encrypting are
the only real defense.
Very few run their own SMTP. Your own SMTP on your own box is not much
different from PGP eudora plug-in autoencrypting. But you cannot use this
argument to preach benefits of under-the-hood crypto - when almost all internet
mail traffic uses ISP-owned SMTP servers.

The main difference, the axis along which one classifies
maillists/usenet/weblogs is the control.
On usenet, once the site agrees to carry a newsgroup, you have many entry
points and automatic distribution that is next to impossible to choke (other
than with noise.)
Maillists are more controllable (as even cypherpunk nodes experienced) but and
probably the least bad solution so far. And they are not much different from
usenet - fewer "newsgroups" (you decide what you want) and you are your own
server. With today's connectivity and computing resources, smaller maillists
(seeral hundred subscribers) don't really need servers (exploders) - just a
shared recipient list. Very censorship-resistant.
Weblogs are at the mercy of site operators and extremely vulnerable to
moronship and censorship.

There are two fronts in the crypto war.
One is the between professionals who don't really waste time reading popular
press and associated crypto-propaganda. It's highly probable that even minor
principalities and their dictators have sufficient access to the basic crypto
expertize - and practical implements like PGP source code. For less than a
$1000 one can put together quite secure pgpfone over POTS, radio or whatever. I
don't think that anyone today reads anyone else's big secrets. What happens in
the field, among ordinary mercenaries is another issue - small portable secure
communicators are probably more common in us forces than among taliban.
Another front is more interesting, it's the current strategy against crypto for
the masses. The strategy is a very good one and it works better than anything
before: the crypto is simply not mentioned at all. In my own experience, more
lay people were aware of crypto issues in mid-90ties than today. By forcing it
below the radar of pop interest, the crypto was dealt the strongest blow so
far. The discrepancy between perils of data harvesting and awareness of it is
rising. This falls. I guess, in the Big Lie axiom: the bigger the lie, the more

Microwave oven.
This has been done in recent years in various theatres.
There is enough wideband power in the ether above inhabited areas to make
passive detection from reflected EM possible in theory (without any EM
emanating from the target.) The space is illuminated, but the "eyes" are not
good enough, yet. Signal levels are extremely low, but it's likely that a
flying jet reflects back enough from hundreds of cellphone/celltower
transmissions to be few dB above the background noise. However, without knowing
where to "look" the receiver cannot use typical narrow beam high-gain antennas.
What is needed is an array, like an insect's eye, and that will be a sizeable
contraption - passive, but not small. In other words, the size of a passive eye
is proportional to the wavelength. To get human eye resolution in 10cm band the
size gets to 2km across. Big eye.

But unlike stego, where the issue is faking the noise, personal fingerprints
can be removed from the message more reliably. You just need the right gloves.
One way is to use automated translators. They all have an "internal language"
and modules that translate to and from it. The internal language is far more
restricted than the natural one, so it doesn't leak many aspects of the
linguistic fingerprint. Going to the internal form is "lossy" compression.
There is no way to recreate the original.
The simplest method is an englih-to-english translator. Better method, and
thicker gloves, can be used by going through several from/to modules for
different languages. In commercial engines the meaning starts to suffer after
3-4 steps but just before that happens the word ordering and use gets
completely skewed.
Of course, you have to buy the translator and not use the online
google/babelfish access. It's the small things that get you ...

I don't get what does this have to do with crypto.
Outside crypto, this didn't quite work with (almost) public fax gateways of
'90s. In theory, you could send e-mail that would be rasterized and faxed using
gateway that was in local calling area and presumably did not incur any charge
from the local POTS monopoly.
However, I don't see people letting others use their POTS lines, nor I see them
using their own for this purpose. Yes, this would essentially eliminate long
distance charges for those so equipped ... but if A and B have these gateways
and use them, what is the chance of them not being AT the gateway (ie. not
having laptops) at any given moment - why bother using POTS in the loop in the
first place ?
VoIP companies are already doing this and the cost is quite low (calling cards)

I think that any loading of e-mail with computational tasks has to follow the
paradigm of the current system, where A sends mail to B and there is absolutely
no other communication betwen B and A or C for that matter.
For instance, take an assymetric algo, where t=Hard(x) and x=Easy(t).
x is something that B can verify is (almost) unique to the message, like
x = (B's e-mail address) + timestamp (must be within last n hours).
A burns cycles to do t=Hard(x) and sends t with the message to B.
B verifies x with x=Easy(t) and accepts or rejects message based on that.
The drawback is that sending any mail costs time. I queue mail and in few
minutes t is computed and mail sent. It could be as little as minute per
message to discourage spam.
No intermediaries, no communication protocols.

@_subject: [mnet-devel] DOS in DHTs (fwd from amichrisde@yahoo.de) 
Looks like the only way to shield from DOS is to raise the cost of DOS. This
will eventually eliminate the low cost of Internet bandwidth, one way or
another. You don't get nearly the same amount of DOS on your telephone as you
do on Internet, right ? Because telephone call is not free and/or it's
The only question is how and where will this cost be introduced. My guess is
that it will happen on the sending side. Even today, assymmetric
cheapo-consumer connectivity makes publishing hard (as in "you are not visible
to the world".) But to handle DOS is harder, as major drive & money on internet
is selling shit, and players want easy (say 800-number) access. Proposals a la
net-driving-license (NDL) indicate the trend.
NDL can happen. Compare it to the early situation with cars or guns. No
regulation in the beginning, you could buy or make your own and do as you
please. Then, when commerce began to depend on both (transport of goods and
force monopolies) they got regulated. I see no difference between that and
computer with an Internet link. NDL is a possible reality. It used to be normal
to drive or carry a weapon without license. These days, they catch you sooner
or later and beat you into pulp. Same thing. Dreaming about it not happening
will get you nowhere.
So what can be done to raise the cost of DOS without introducing NDL ? I have
no answer to this.
What kind of NDL is the least bad ?
- requirement for something that requires human effort when opening a
connection. You do want to let humans into the store, but will refuse entry to
headless drones. OK, wrong analogy. But you get the idea.
- simply raise the cost of outgoing bandwidth - add a cost to every SYN request
or equivalent (have a decent number included in the basic bandwith fee.) This
will make unsuspecting collaborators in DDoS more efficient in keeping their
equipment clean  ("whoever aids .... will be considered enemy combatant.)
The future doesn't seem bright. I think that there is a short window - a year
or two - in which some not-so-bad solution may preempt what They are trying to
do. But I wouldn't hold my breath. It's far more likely that EFF and other
wirehuggers will continue to be outraged (with zero effect as usual) and
clampdown on 'net access will continue.

This boils down to difficulty of faking the analog interface.
Anything that regular camera captures the attacker can also capture and
reproduce it for the benefit of the camera. This means that camera has to be
able to distinguish between the real thing and images of the real thing. This
probably means going beyond optical image and somehow detecting 3D coordinates
of particles, forcing the attacker to actually construct a new physical key
At the current level of technology and economy, it's cheaper to hire an
unemployed hardware engineer (no, s/w engs are not qualified,) to look at the
key than to construct a 3D particle-sensing camera.

At this point it is immaterial what Verisign will or will not do. They followed
the predictable course based on their capabilities and the assessment that the
response from some imaginary "community" is irrelevant.
The actual damage is breaking network diagnostic procedures and spam filtering,
increasing chance of undetected lost e-mail (their SMTP does not always bounce)
and increased danger of mistyped domain names - as now such typo in http client
leads to exposure to possibly adversarial html (which is why they started it
all in the first place.)
By this time it should be obvious to everyone that in the near future they will
establish targeted advertizing depending on what the mistyped URL looks like -
and probably sell or rent the "typo name space" - ie. Airborne Express could
buy *f?*e?*d?*e?*x?*.com address space, so fredex.com would lead to airborne's
web site.
And then there is a very small step from there to schemes where, for instance,
for basic $15-25/yr name rental your domain will be yours only in 90% of cases.
Other 10% will be sold. For $100/yr you will be guaranteed 99.5% of the
ownership. Of course, only platinum premium accounts, at $100K/yr, will have
100% ownership.
That is the problem when a centralized technical solution relies on the legal
system (and they almost always do.)
What is important is how and if will this accelerate alternate solutions for
name space management.

Apologies for introducing crypto-related stuff: RNG that reads minds and predicts future:
Can This Black Box See Into the Future?
DEEP in the basement of a dusty university library in Edinburgh lies a
small black box, roughly the size of two cigarette packets side by side,
that churns out random numbers in an endless stream.
At first glance it is an unremarkable piece of equipment. Encased in
metal, it contains at its heart a microchip no more complex than the
ones found in modern pocket calculators.
But, according to a growing band of top scientists, this box has quite
extraordinary powers. It is, they claim, the 'eye' of a machine that
appears capable of peering into the future and predicting major world
The machine apparently sensed the September 11 attacks on the World
Trade Centre four hours before they happened - but in the fevered mood
of conspiracy theories of the time, the claims were swiftly knocked back
by sceptics. But last December, it also appeared to forewarn of the
Asian tsunami just before the deep sea earthquake that precipitated the
epic tragedy.
Now, even the doubters are acknowledging that here is a small box with
apparently inexplicable powers.
'It's Earth-shattering stuff,' says Dr Roger Nelson, emeritus researcher
at Princeton University in the United States, who is heading the
research project behind the 'black box' phenomenon.
'We're very early on in the process of trying to figure out what's going
on here. At the moment we're stabbing in the dark.' Dr Nelson's
investigations, called the Global Consciousness Project, were originally
hosted by Princeton University and are centred on one of the most
extraordinary experiments of all time. Its aim is to detect whether all
of humanity shares a single subconscious mind that we can all tap into
without realising.
And machines like the Edinburgh black box have thrown up a tantalising
possibility: that scientists may have unwittingly discovered a way of
predicting the future.
Although many would consider the project's aims to be little more than
fools' gold, it has still attracted a roster of 75 respected scientists
from 41 different nations. Researchers from Princeton - where Einstein
spent much of his career - work alongside scientists from universities
in Britain, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Germany. The project is
also the most rigorous and longest-running investigation ever into the
potential powers of the paranormal.
'Very often paranormal phenomena evaporate if you study them for long
enough,' says physicist Dick Bierman of the University of Amsterdam.
'But this is not happening with the Global Consciousness Project. The
effect is real. The only dispute is about what it means.' The project
has its roots in the extraordinary work of Professor Robert Jahn of
Princeton University during the late 1970s. He was one of the first
modern scientists to take paranormal phenomena seriously. Intrigued by
such things as telepathy, telekinesis - the supposed psychic power to
move objects without the use of physical force - and extrasensory
perception, he was determined to study the phenomena using the most
up-to-date technology available.
One of these new technologies was a humble-looking black box known was a
Random Event Generator (REG). This used computer technology to generate
two numbers - a one and a zero - in a totally random sequence, rather
like an electronic coin-flipper.
The pattern of ones and noughts - 'heads' and 'tails' as it were - could
then be printed out as a graph. The laws of chance dictate that the
generators should churn out equal numbers of ones and zeros - which
would be represented by a nearly flat line on the graph. Any deviation
from this equal number shows up as a gently rising curve.
During the late 1970s, Prof Jahn decided to investigate whether the
power of human thought alone could interfere in some way with the
machine's usual readings. He hauled strangers off the street and asked
them to concentrate their minds on his number generator. In effect, he
was asking them to try to make it flip more heads than tails.
It was a preposterous idea at the time. The results, however, were
stunning and have never been satisfactorily explained.
Again and again, entirely ordinary people proved that their minds could
influence the machine and produce significant fluctuations on the graph,
'forcing it' to produce unequal numbers of 'heads' or 'tails'.
According to all of the known laws of science, this should not have
happened - but it did. And it kept on happening.
Dr Nelson, also working at Princeton University, then extended Prof
Jahn's work by taking random number machines to group meditations, which
were very popular in America at the time. Again, the results were
eyepopping. The groups were collectively able to cause dramatic shifts
in the patterns of numbers.
Using the internet, he connected up 40 random event generators from all
over the world to his laboratory computer in Princeton. These ran
constantly, day in day out, generating millions of different pieces of
data. Most of the time, the resulting graph on his computer looked more
or less like a flat line.
But then on September 6, 1997, something quite extraordinary happened:
the graph shot upwards, recording a sudden and massive shift in the
number sequence as his machines around the world started reporting huge
deviations from the norm. The day was of historic importance for another
reason, too.
For it was the same day that an estimated one billion people around the
world watched the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales at Westminster
Dr Nelson was convinced that the two events must be related in some way.
Could he have detected a totally new phenomena? Could the concentrated
emotional outpouring of millions of people be able to influence the
output of his REGs. If so, how?
Dr Nelson was at a loss to explain it.
So, in 1998, he gathered together scientists from all over the world to
analyse his findings. They, too, were stumped and resolved to extend and
deepen the work of Prof Jahn and Dr Nelson. The Global Consciousness
Project was born.
Since then, the project has expanded massively. A total of 65 Eggs (as
the generators have been named) in 41 countries have now been recruited
to act as the 'eyes' of the project.
And the results have been startling and inexplicable in equal measure.
For during the course of the experiment, the Eggs have 'sensed' a whole
series of major world events as they were happening, from the Nato
bombing of Yugoslavia to the Kursk submarine tragedy to America's hung
election of 2000.
The Eggs also regularly detect huge global celebrations, such as New
Year's Eve.
But the project threw up its greatest enigma on September 11, 2001.
As the world stood still and watched the horror of the terrorist attacks
unfold across New York, something strange was happening to the Eggs.
Not only had they registered the attacks as they actually happened, but
the characteristic shift in the pattern of numbers had begun four hours
before the two planes even hit the Twin Towers.
They had, it appeared, detected that an event of historic importance was
about to take place before the terrorists had even boarded their fateful
flights. The implications, not least for the West's security services
who constantly monitor electronic 'chatter', are clearly enormous.
'I knew then that we had a great deal of work ahead of us,' says Dr
What could be happening? Was it a freak occurrence, perhaps?
Apparently not. For in the closing weeks of December last year, the
machines went wild once more.
Twenty-four hours later, an earthquake deep beneath the Indian Ocean
triggered the tsunami which devastated South-East Asia, and claimed the
lives of an estimated quarter of a million people.
So could the Global Consciousness Project really be forecasting the
Cynics will quite rightly point out that there is always some global
event that could be used to 'explain' the times when the Egg machines
behaved erratically. After all, our world is full of wars, disasters and
terrorist outrages, as well as the occasional global celebration. Are
the scientists simply trying too hard to detect patterns in their raw
The team behind the project insist not. They claim that by using
rigorous scientific techniques and powerful mathematics it is possible
to exclude any such random connections.
'We're perfectly willing to discover that we've made mistakes,' says Dr
Nelson. 'But we haven't been able to find any, and neither has anyone
Our data shows clearly that the chances of getting these results by
fluke are one million to one against.
That's hugely significant.' But many remain sceptical.
Professor Chris French, a psychologist and noted sceptic at Goldsmiths
College in London, says: 'The Global Consciousness Project has generated
some very intriguing results that cannot be readily dismissed. I'm
involved in similar work to see if we get the same results. We haven't
managed to do so yet but it's only an early experiment. The jury's still
out.' Strange as it may seem, though, there's nothing in the laws of
physics that precludes the possibility of foreseeing the future.
It is possible - in theory - that time may not just move forwards but
backwards, too. And if time ebbs and flows like the tides in the sea, it
might just be possible to foretell major world events. We would, in
effect, be 'remembering' things that had taken place in our future.
'There's plenty of evidence that time may run backwards,' says Prof
Bierman at the University of Amsterdam.
'And if it's possible for it to happen in physics, then it can happen in
our minds, too.' In other words, Prof Bierman believes that we are all
capable of looking into the future, if only we could tap into the hidden
power of our minds. And there is a tantalising body of evidence to
support this theory.
Dr John Hartwell, working at the University of Utrecht in the
Netherlands, was the first to uncover evidence that people could sense
the future. In the mid-1970s he hooked people up to hospital scanning
machines so that he could study their brainwave patterns.
He began by showing them a sequence of provocative cartoon drawings.
When the pictures were shown, the machines registered the subject's
brainwaves as they reacted strongly to the images before them. This was
to be expected.
Far less easy to explain was the fact that in many cases, these dramatic
patterns began to register a few seconds before each of the pictures
were even flashed up.
It was as though Dr Hartwell's case studies were somehow seeing into the
future, and detecting when the next shocking image would be shown next.
It was extraordinary - and seemingly inexplicable.
But it was to be another 15 years before anyone else took Dr Hartwell's
work further when Dean Radin, a researcher working in America, connected
people up to a machine that measured their skin's resistance to
electricity. This is known to fluctuate in tandem with our moods -
indeed, it's this principle that underlies many lie detectors.
Radin repeated Dr Hartwell's 'image response' experiments while
measuring skin resistance. Again, people began reacting a few seconds
before they were shown the provocative pictures. This was clearly
impossible, or so he thought, so he kept on repeating the experiments.
And he kept getting the same results.
'I didn't believe it either,' says Prof Bierman. 'So I also repeated the
experiment myself and got the same results. I was shocked. After this I
started to think more deeply about the nature of time.' To make matters
even more intriguing, Prof Bierman says that other mainstream labs have
now produced similar results but are yet to go public.
'They don't want to be ridiculed so they won't release their findings,'
he says. 'So I'm trying to persuade all of them to release their results
at the same time. That would at least spread the ridicule a little more
thinly!' If Prof Bierman is right, though, then the experiments are no
laughing matter.
They might help provide a solid scientific grounding for such strange
phenomena as 'deja vu', intuition and a host of other curiosities that
we have all experienced from time to time.
They may also open up a far more interesting possibility - that one day
we might be able to enhance psychic powers using machines that can 'tune
in' to our subconscious mind, machines like the little black box in
Just as we have built mechanical engines to replace muscle power, could
we one day build a device to enhance and interpret our hidden psychic
Dr Nelson is optimistic - but not for the short term. 'We may be able to
predict that a major world event is going to happen. But we won't know
exactly what will happen or where it's going to happen,' he says.
'Put it this way - we haven't yet got a machine we could sell to the
But for Dr Nelson, talk of such psychic machines - with the potential to
detect global catastrophes or terrorist outrages - is of far less
importance than the implications of his work in terms of the human race.
For what his experiments appear to demonstrate is that while we may all
operate as individuals, we also appear to share something far, far
greater - a global consciousness. Some might call it the mind of God.
'We're taught to be individualistic monsters,' he says. 'We're driven by
society to separate ourselves from each other. That's not right.
We may be connected together far more intimately than we realise.'

Just a tiny interesting operation found out via routine misspelling that can
breed paranoia in idle minds:
sprint has smtp to SMS gateway for its customers running at
messaging.sprintpcs.com, so if you e-mail to tendigitnumber at messaging.sprintpcs.com the user gets message on the phone.
Interestingly enough, there is also valid domain messaging.sprintpsc.com (note
the swapped last two letters) that resolves to no less than 8 IP addresses.
Someone wants it really reliable:
Addresses:  69.25.27.171, 66.150.161.141, 69.25.27.170, 69.25.27.172
          66.150.161.133, 66.150.161.140, 66.150.161.134, 66.150.161.136
sprintpsc.com is operated by po-box identified entity:
 Acme Mail
 Box 455
 Miami, FL 33265
 US
 305-201-4774 and of course messages sent to tendigitnumber at messaging.sprintpcs.com do not
end up on sprint's subscriber handset.
Could be completely coincidental, of course.

What is the threat model? Even ROT-13 would thwart casual listening on or data
harvesting. If you to be secure then you use voice over IPSec, PGPhone or any
of dozens of other solutions.
The idea that a commercial carrier can or should provide NSA-proof security
boggles the mind. Nice masturbatory material though.

There is a constant 20 years lag between a crack and public awareness of the
same. We'll know in 2016.
But you are reasonably safe in the meantime - remember, during WW2 Germans
submarines were allowed to sink many ships in order to mask breaking of Enigma.
The tactic for others was to send planes to 'accidentally' spot the submarine.
All analogies are perfectly valid today. To maintain the potential crack
technology an asset, they will have to use plausible classical means of
discovering the plaintext.

Cable cutting, if that's what it is, impairs two domains: data harvesting (as
there is less to harvest) and cost/quality of the affected communications.
These two domains cannot possibly belong to the same side of the Conflict. I
find affecting data harvesting to be improbable, so it's either:
- done by the affected principalities themselves as a neat way to limit
undesired communications for their own subjects;
- or a spook agency doing a live "what if comms go away" testing in irrelevant
parts of the world;
- or a previously undiscovered natural phenomenon (mutant laser-head sharks.)

The cost of breaking even bad crypto can be quite high.
If you just take, for example, DES, and change all S boxes to different random values, then provide these values as pre-arranged secret key to the other party, and use them only with this single correspondent, and keep your algorithm secret, while using a single 1-character key "a" through "5" depending on the day of month, how long do you think it will take someone to break the cipher and how much would it cost?
First they have to get enough text for correlation and differential attacks. Then they are starting with quite long 2K-bit S boxes that need to be inferred. It would take a brilliant analyst more then few days to break this. Few days of a brilliant analyst at Ft. Mead are very expensive, when you include all the overhead. Say $0.1-0.5M.
Compare this cost to the cost of breaking a massively used crypto algorithm with a backdoor.

The distributed model needs to be people-centric, not site-centric, and recreate existing social models (*not* failed "web of trust".)
As a wild example:
Imagine everyone being able to issue blinded Chaumian cash. You give your coins to people you, sort of, trust a bit. Maybe various coins for various purposes.
Then those people submit (now blinded) coins to the web sites they, sort of, trust.
You come to a site, do automated hashed lookup*, and if you recognise some minimum amount of your own coins, you, sort of, start to pay attention to that site.
There is no CA anywhere to be seen, except yourself.
* I know this is expensive, but this can be a one-time event after which you certify the site to your browser(s).

What I find endlessly amusing is that enormous amount of crypt-engineering efforts go into development of resilient P2P networks with "freedom fighters"-class of rationalizations, only to be exclusively used by those who just want free commercial content.
At least, without these networks, those without money would be spared from that drivel.

While avalanche noise (hoping it doesn't start to tunnel - that current must be actively controlled as each junction is different) is a good source of randomness (up to megabits / sec / junction), "encrypting" it just means masking possible low entropy. I'd prefer to see raw conditoned stream than "encrypted" one (even web content looks high-entropy to Diehard when encrypted).

Antartica can function without external cash flow only if it's zero-sum inside, ie. no value created, which is true for any collection of, ehm, scientists.
Growing, however, creates real value that would need to be balanced with external cash inflow (a very useful indicator of how much is being grown, BTW.)

I think that the term "growing" was misunderstood - it refers to a certain floral activity, and I'll bet that there's not export, it's all consumed internally.

The issue was that the threat model was not successfully sold to the general public. This was/is a political/sociological obstacle.
Think the smoking issue: it was hard to shed light on the causality where cause and effect are 10-20 years apart, despite the fact that almost all major players (except the tobacco industry) cooperated.
With encryption, none of the major players cooperates, and the distance between the cause and effect is more likely 20-30 years (data harvesters getting ahead of and hamstringing the general public.)

BitCoin has only one problem: maintenance of the relationship between unit BitCoin value and the material world (energy, as in KWh) is 'soft', it requires some sort of a volatile communal effort, which sets it for failure (as a counter example, the amount of Au atoms on this planet is rather independent from any communal effort.)
The relationship between unit value and the material world needs to be fixed. It's just a matter of time.
Then we may name it ButtCoin.

@_subject: <nettime> What do you think about .art? 
DNS and ICANN and such are on their way out. Private namespaces are back.
The assumption - that, for example, xyz.com *must* resolve to the same IP number wherever the query is done - went curiously unchallenged for a long time. Now, seriously, why is it so important that google.com means the same in New Zealand and Czech Republic? Where is this notion that the planet needs the globally unique name space coming from? What makes it "good" (hint - you can't use Google, Inc. profits as an argument) ? Historically, only the state insisted on unique identifiers, for its own needs.
The unique namespace is a terrible idea. It's a shit amplifier. It skips and disables local roadsigns and greatly reduces the number of roadsign posters. It's no wonder that ICANN attracts slimy thugs - a prospect that few can decide on global naming has attractiveness of a dung pile for flies miles away.
There are very good reasons for having things harder to find. A complex discovery process itself is a great moron filter. During the search you may find things and people you didn't look for.

How is this conceptually different from a 2-node Tor network, where each ISP operates one node of the pair linking to every other ISP (so there are I^2 pairs)? Additional benefit of using Tor would be mixing and making traffic analysis harder. Threat modelling could draw on the existing research on Tor vulnerabilities.
Also, an ISP could easily, today, run single-node Tor network to obscure end point locations.
The problem does not seem technical at all. The problem is that ISPs have physical addresses. What you need is a floating ISP ... go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man
