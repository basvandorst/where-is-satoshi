@_subject: Using Hotmail as an exit remailer 
Congratulations to Ian Goldberg on his great script for sending via
Hotmail!  This is sent using the script, with the following info.
The proxy comes from the web page Ian supplied:
$login is "ldeliverer";
$passwd is "xxxx";
$proxyhost is 'secure.escape.ca';
$proxyport is 80;
(Warning: sometimes hotmail eats equals signs.)
The only problem is you need to install several extra modules into Perl.
I had to add these packages:
Now let's modify it to work with rocketmail, usa.net, etc.  Be nice to
see an account-creation script, too.
Good job, Ian.

Looks like hotmail is double spacing the output.  Easily fixed, change
  $msg = &escapetext(join("\r\n", ));
  $msg = &escapetext(join("", ));
