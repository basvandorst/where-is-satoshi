I was wondering, did you ever get an answer?
I also have the surfboard 3100 and would like the same thing.

I have a SB3100 cable modem and would like to know if there is anyone
that know how to or has the program to access the cable modem?
I would like to see if there is a way to speed my modem up a bit..
