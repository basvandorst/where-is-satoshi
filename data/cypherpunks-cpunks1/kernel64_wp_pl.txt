@_subject: Digital signature 
I'm new on cyperpunks list. I'm looking for information aboout digital
I'm especially interested in mathematics of digital signature:
algorithms, computional compexity, algorithm correctness proofs, attack
on keys and all mathematical stuff apply to digital signatutes.
