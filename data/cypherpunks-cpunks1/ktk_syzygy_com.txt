@_subject: Dec. 10th Bay Area Cypherpunks Meeting 
This month's Bay Area Cypherpunks Meeting will be held this Saturday,
December 10th, from 12 noon until 6 pm in Silicon Graphics Cafe Iris
(same cypher time, same cypher channel...).
The topic for this month's discussions is:
We have three speakers planned. Susan Langford will speak on Cryptanalysis of DES and Other Block
Cyphers.  She will be speaking generally on the subject, and will
discuss her work on Differential Linear Cryptanalysis of DES.  Susan
is working with Martin Hellman at Stanford University.
Raph Levien will present  ``The Security of Cypher Block Chaining'', a
paper from Crypto '94 by Mihir Bellare, Joe Kilian, and Phillip
Rogaway.  Raph is working to infect all mail user agents with PGP.
Eric Hughes will present ``Towards the Equivalence of Breaking the
Diffie-Hellman Protocol and Computing Discrete Logarithms'', a paper
from Crypto '94 by Ueli M. Maurer.  Eric has been active in the
Cypherpunks movement for several years now.
Additional speakers are of course welcome.  Discussions of
implementations of crypto systems are welcome also.  Please contact me
(ktk at sgi.com or ktk at syzygy.com) asap if you are interested in
speaking.  Presentations need not be long.
Suggestions for dinner are welcome.
