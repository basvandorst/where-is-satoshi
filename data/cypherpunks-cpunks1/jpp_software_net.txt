Huh?  So you run on 120 workstations worth how much?  to steal a credit
card number worth how much?  Get real - there are hundreds of ways
to get credit card numbers that cost less.  The idea is to make
breaking SSL less attractive than dumpster diving not to make it
impossible.   I'll lay odds that I could get the credit card number
of *any* individual in the US in less elapsed time and with nothing
more than a $1000 windoze machinei, a telephone and a modem.

According to reports popping up in other places around the Compuserve Information Service it appears that they have taken a stance of Internet censor and are now blocking access to certain Usenet newsgroups.  This move took place just before the Christmas holiday and remains unannounced to the membership/subscriber base.  Just about any Usenet newsgroup with the word "sex" or "erotica" are no longer available. Attempts to subscribe to these newsgroups produces an error message stating that the newsgroup does not exist.  In reality its access has been blocked.
A short list (very short) of other newsgroup feeds that are no longer accessible as provided by another party to me include:
Other newsgroups also remain blocked or eliminated from a provided pick-list and if this is allowed to continue the likelihood of this spreading to other topics that a select group find offensive or intolerable is a very real threat.
A number of these newsgroups are legitimate groups for people needing support or recovery or places where frank discussions on adult subjects take place.  Some are religious in nature though non-mainstream.  Others are associated with the gay lifestyle.  As you can see there is a definite trend being set here.
So far much of this change in access remains unknown to the vast majority of Compuserve customers who remain away from their terminals for the If this bothers you I would suggest that you send a message to Compuserve customer services at GO FEEDBACK.  Those using autopilot programs send e-mail to Feedback at 70006,101.  From outside of Compuserve send e-mail to 70006.101 at compuserve.com

@_subject: Patents etc 
Hmmmm the argument about hardware companies paying 10% to intel 5% to the
capacitor folks does not stand up.  The reason is that hardware people do
*exactly* that and in return they receive the physical token (chip,
capacitor etc) that represents the intellectual property they just bought. Patents in the hardware world can slow evolution just as much as in software.  A good example is the "cats eye" papent in the UK.  Cats eyes are the reflective studs in the road, until the original UK patent ran out *nobody* did any work in the UK  to improve on the orginal design because the royalty burden made it uneconomic.  Whats make software different is the ability to freely copy it
without special hardware.  This lack of a physical token is what
causes all the problems. IMHO What's needed is a) a good way of measuring usage and b) a realistic
attitude on the part of patent holders as to the value of their patents. A good example of how not to do it is the current mess that governs the
music indistry (which very similar problems with copying and incorporation
of material [sampling] all be it in a context of copyright rather than
patents). Ted Nelson did a lot of work on this for xanadu and his ideas on transcopyright are worth exploring further.

10:20 PR Visa And Mastercard Combine Security Specifications For Card
Transactions On The Internet Into One Standard
Companies: X.MST X.VSA   Move Expected to Accelerate Development of
Electronic Commerce and  Bolster Consumer Confidence in the Security of
Cyberspace Transactions
   PURCHASE, N.Y. & SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 1 /PRNewswire/ -- Addressing
consumer concerns about making purchases on the Internet, MasterCard
International and Visa International joined together today to announce a
technical standard for safeguarding payment card purchases made over open
networks such as the Internet.  Prior to this effort, Visa and MasterCard
were pursuing separate specifications.  The new specification, called Secure
Electronic Transactions (SET), represents the successful convergence of
those individual efforts.  A single standard means that consumers and
merchants will be able to conduct bankcard transactions in cyberspace as
securely and easily as they do in retail stores today.   The associations expect to publish SET on their World Wide Web sites in
mid-February.  Following a comment period, the joint specification is
scheduled to be ready for testing in the second quarter of 1996.  Visa and
MasterCard expect that banks will be able to offer secure bankcard services
via the Internet to their cardholders in the fourth quarter 1996.   Participants in this effort with MasterCard and Visa are:  GTE, IBM,
Microsoft, Netscape Communications Corp., SAIC, Terisa Systems and Verisign.
Also, SET will be based on specially developed encryption technology from
RSA Data Security.   "This is the first step in making cyberspace an attractive venture for
banks and merchants.  A single standard limits unnecessary costs and builds
the business case for doing business on the Internet," said Edmund Jensen,
president and CEO of Visa International.  "Further, our work with MasterCard
demonstrates our unwavering commitment to address the needs of our member
financial institutions and their merchants and cardholders."   H. Eugene Lockhart, CEO of MasterCard, said:  "MasterCard has viewed one
standard for secure card purchases on the Internet as a critical catalyst
for electronic commerce because it bolsters consumer confidence in the
security of the electronic marketplace.  A single standard has always been
our objective because it is in the best interests of not only consumers, but
also merchants and financial institutions worldwide. We are glad to work
with Visa and all of the technology partners to craft SET.  This action
means that consumers will be able to use their bankcards to conduct
transactions in cyberspace as securely and easily as they use cards in
retail stores today."   The card associations will separately test SET with consumers, merchants
and financial institutions.  A joint interoperability test will be conducted
after the individual tests to ensure SET, where necessary, operates as
smoothly as the point-of-sale system used today. Upon conclusion of the
tests, an updated version of the specification will be published for
software providers.   MasterCard's Web address is   Visa's Web address
is    MasterCard International Incorporated is a global payments company that
provides consumer credit, debit and other payment products in partnership
with 22,000 member financial institutions worldwide. MasterCard's family of
brands, MasterCard, Maestro and Cirrus, represent approximately 300 million
cards in circulation, and over 13 million acceptance locations, including
243,000 MasterCard/Cirrus ATMs worldwide.  MasterCard's pioneering work in
the areas of transaction processing and delivery systems continues to
revolutionize the way consumers pay for goods and services.   Headquartered in the San Francisco Bay Area, Visa is the world's largest
payment system.  It plays a pivotal role in developing and implementing new
technologies that benefit its 19,000 member financial institutions and their
cardholders, businesses, governments and the global economy.  Visa's 442

The code looks something like this:
1) hook into the winsock and look for an FV message in the web data stream,
save the ID.
2) now look for an approve/deny/fraud, when you see one you know that the
user uses an IP connection for mail and web.
3) Forward the ID to an anon box.
4) Look for outbound FV messages with 'fraud' or 'deny' and change to 'approve'.
Clearly this will miss AOL, CI$ etc al but thats not important.
The issue is not FV noticing the error, they will, it's how long it takes
 and how much you can steal in the interim.
There is a Helen Keller quote I'm rather fond of which starts:
 "Security is mostly a superstition ..."
  *If the machine is not secure all bets are off*
The most likly failure vector for this attack is that so few people use FV :-)

You missed my point.
1) hook into the winsock and look for an FV message in the web data stream,
save the ID.
2) now look for an approve/deny/fraud, when you see one you know that the
user uses an IP connection for mail and web.
3) only now does the attack begin.
The attack does not trigger until it *knows* that both FV orders and
confirms are moving via winsock - I.E. it does not report back the FV ID of
the victim until it sees the victim use FV and *knows* it can intercept the
reply.  The key  here is not breaking all cases just a significant number
and not setting off too many alarms.
This significantly lowers the fraud detection risk, now the fraud does not
get noticed until the card statement shows up, the same as with a card
number snooping attack.
Yes it will miss a large group of FV customers who use AOL, CI$ etc
(although a similar hook in the common serial port code on Win95 could catch
most of them).
The basic point is if the achine is not secure then no data on it is either.

In the FV model as I understand it I'd have to ship the software and wait for an approve/deny/fraud from the user.  If it's anything but approved I'm SOL,

Here is my take on a C version of their code - note that a[] b[] c[] and the
initial d are filled in from the 'one time pad'.  The size of a,b,c is not
specified it could be 8 16 or 32 bits from the text ...  However the initial
values of a,b & c are set using 8 bits of the 'random' key.
int a[64]  /* Random & 0x3500 */
int b[64]  /* Randomly selected primes */
int c[64]  /* randomly selected primes*/
char d;     /* random start value */
int i;
by IPG using 'random' numbers supplied by IPG to select the primes (and the
order of same).  since all the values are > 8 bits I've assumed a,b,c = int. a[] is filled with 13568 + an 8 bit 'random' number.  (13568 = 0x3500 which
gets ANDed with the seed value)
        for(i=0; i<64;i++)
        {
                a[i] = (a[i] + b[i]) % c[i];
                d = (d+a[i]) & 0xFF;
                /* output d as next byte in stream */
                /* XOR with plaintext */
        }
I would not trust it without spending more time than I have

Obviously, you meet our requirementsfor the release of the IPG ABC Encryption algorithms. We need no further information from you. though we would appreciate your telephone num and snail mail address. The algorithms detailed below are copyrighted 1995 and 1996 by Internet Privacy Guaranteed, Seymour, TX. All rights are reserved. You may not
provide them to any other party, or parties, by any means or any media, without the expressed written permission of Internet Privacy Guaranteed. What is specially claimed as copyrighted and or patentable are:
     1. The use of the word Ultima for the system, because it is         impossible to have a either a more secure system - it is         impossible to break the Ultima system, other equally difficult          to break systems may exist, or may be formulated in the future,
        for example a true OTP,  and in those cases, they may         "theoretically" be more difficult to break than the IPG Ultima         System, for example a true OTP. However, that would exist only in         theory, because in those eventiualities, none of the         systems would be breakable.
        Furthermore as to speed, Ultima, or simple variations, XOR, OR,
        or AND, instead of the Add or Subtract, is the fastest possible         algorithm which will produce an unbreakable encryption system,         without having a single OTP byte for each byte of plain text to be         encrypted, as in an OTP. However, with the IPG system, we can         obtain the same speed, or theoretically faster speeds than a pure         OTP, with some very simple parrallelism - and that begs how         you get humoungous OTPs to use, both in terms of generating         them and getting them into a stream to be XORed against the plain         text. That FACT, that the IPG algorithms are the fastest         possible encryption system which will become evident when you         examine the algorithms in detail.         Thus it is impossible to produce a better system, in terms of         either security or speed, thus we call our system Ultima, the         ultimate.
    2.  The use of the term ABC Encryption algorithm that at once         describes the basics of the system and its simplicity as will         quickly become evident.
    3.  The use of a hardware generated OTP, which serves as a purely         random seed, for the system to be described.
    4.  The use of a table of prime numbers, any number of which is greater         than 3, from which random selections are made to be used in the         algorithms to be described. The prime numbers for the system         described have been selected for a specific hardware, namely the         IBM PC clone, market. With other 16 bit, 32 bit, or 64 bit         hardware, other prime numbers could be used to provide immediate         results just as in the system to be described. The use of         larger numbers, the use of larger adders, or logic gating         systems, is self evident in the copyrights/patents.        5.  The use of a random 8 bit seed for the dynamic vaiable that links         the sets of equations into one system. This variable, D, for         dynamic is the real key that distinguishes our system from any         other system - excepting hardware implemented systems that use         extremely large numbers, and or possible partitions, that         encompass possible meaningful message lengths. Such systems, are         self evident extensions of the simple IPG system.
    6.  The use of partitions within one OTP, pure random seed, PRNG stream         - either by using parts of the random seeds, or more         likely by using fixed intervals within the PRNG stream, for         example, arbitrarily say every 100 gigabytes, or 100 terabytes for         that matter. Using this technique, one random seed can be used for         any abritrary period of time, one message, 10 messages, one day, one         week, one year, one century, one millenium or whatever.  The use         of multiple Ds, in linear partitions, that is within one otp         every terabyte fior example,  is a self evident extension of the         IPG system.     7. The use of a simple serial hardware implementation of the IPG         system is self evident, and produces impressive speeds, mutiple         megabyte per second, dependent of course on hardware speeds.
    8. The use of a very simple single level of parallelism in hardware        implementation, where the ABCs are computed in parrallel, and        the D is passed along, is a simple self evident extension        of the system and will allow a throughput of over        100 megabytes per second, on state of the sart hardware.
    9. The use of a three dimensional parallel system, where the PRG        stream is chopped up into several partitions, say every terabyte,        and then each module proceeds as in paragraph 8, just above, is a        simple extension of the basic IPG system, a would enable a system        to operate at any conceivable line speed.    10. The changing of the number of equations, modules, prime number        values, length of prime numbers, or length of random sample, probe        values, or the other algorithmic values does not change  the basic        algorithm. It is the same algorithm with different values.  With the previously detailed claims relating to the copyrightable and  patentable features of the IPG algorithm system, IPG prersents the the Ultima Algorithms. - the ABC Encryption system.
    1. A 1792 BIT OTP, RANDOM SEED, generated from a hardware        source.
    2. A Table of 319 Prime Numbers in the range of 6,667 to 11,997, out        of the 580+ available, the 384 selected for dynamic variance,        the table is called BPRIMES.
    3. A Table of 319 prime numbers in the range of 14,007 to 19,997, out        of the 800+ available, the 384 selected for dynamic variance,        the table is called CPRIMES        The 1792 bits of OTP, Random Seed, are allocated as follows.           1. 512 bits for the 64 probes, for 64 C vales
          2. 512 bits for the 64 probes, for 64 B values
          3. 512 bits for the 64 starting A values           4.   8 bits for the initial ID value.
          Those 1544 bits are the actual random seed used for generating           the PRNG stream, if you insist on calling it that. In addition,           there are 248 bits used as follows.            5. 128 bits for the offset, partition, if applicable into the              PRNG stream. Actually they are used to encrypt the              actual underlying value of the partition, if any - note - in              this case the mode is actually a true OTP, the first time              only ot really does not help to know the offset unless              you know the OTP, Random Seed.           6. 72 bits for uniquely identifying the OTP being used.
          7. 48 bits as spares temporarily - can be used as different D
             values for partitions. If more As, Bs, Cs, are needed the              random seed, OTP, can be expanded as necessary. Unlike RSA,              there is no practical limit - I am actually sending you 1792
             BYTE Random seeds, so that you can test other variations if you              like, or use each of them, there are 32 of them in all, as 8              random seeds for the 1792 bit algorithm.         8 bit random starting A values are sufficient because we are        only talking about the effect on the low order 8 bits in our PRNG        stream. We actually AND these values with the constant 13,568        to give us a start that will intially have a dynamic effect        on the A, B, and C values, that is the smallest possible        B+13568, exceeds that largest possible C value.              This selection process of course makes the A, B and C values        random, 8 bits, as well as the initial ID value - the random range of        each set is 2 to 32 but as you will see they are interlimked        with the Dynamic variable, D.    The procedure is as follows:
      1. Using the 64 bytes for B selection, we select 64 Bs,
         B1,..,B64,  as follows.
         B1=BPRIMES(SB1) WHERE SB1 is the first byte of the Random Number             Seed, thus B1 is one of the BPRIMES, BPRIMES(0),..BPRIMES(255)
            then
         BPRIMES(SB1)=BPRIMES(256)                then
         B2=BPRIMES(SB2) AS BEFORE EXCEPT Byte 2 of the OTP, Random Seed,             is used.             then           BRPIMES(SB2)=BPRIMES(257)          and so forth through 64
        Thus you have 64 constants, B1,..,B64, each of which is an unique         prime number. This of course, is the same as a lottery selection,         except there is no denominator and the section pool does not         shrink. Thus you have 1 in 2 to the 512 possibilities of a         repeat, or guessing the selections.      2. The same procedure is used for selecting 64 C values, C1 through         C64.            3. The 64 starting A byte values, from the random seed, are         ANDed to 13,568 to give the 64 starting A values, random, at least 8         bit random.
     4. 8 Bits are used for the starting D value
     Thus the B  and Cs are constants - the As and D changes        Then quite simply, you have 64 equation sets as follows.      A1=(A1+B1) MOD C1  (Move, Add, Compare, Conditional Subtract)         D=(D+A1) AND 255  (Really just use DL in assembly language)
          +      A2=(A2+B2) MOD C2
     D=(D+A2) AND 255      ..............
          +      A63=(A63+B63) MOD C63
     D=(D+A63) AND 255           +
     A64=(A64+B64) MOD C64         D=(D+A64) AND 255
     the XOR operation against the plain text may vary. In our case, we      accumulate a pair of DLs in CX, and then XOR it against a wor, two      bytes of plain text. Thus we have one XOR for each set of two      equations above, 32 XORs for the 64 equations. We string A1 type      8 sets of those 64 equations together,  essentially duplicates of each      other except for the XOR operation, which are constants, as opposed to
     indexed variables. Thus we do a disk sector at a time, with only the      A values and D being variables. With double buffering, you can see      that it cooks, to say the very least.       Obviously by definition, there can be no repeat before the product of      the C values, that is (C1*C2*C3,..,*C63*C64), and that does not take      into account the starting A values and the starting D value. The      average C value is slightly over 14 bits. Accordingly, no repeat      is possible before 2 to the 864th power,minimum, or 2 to the      896th power average, 10 to the 267th power minimum, which will handle      anything that can possibly occur, ever, ever, ever. If every atom in      the universe was a Googol of Cray T3E's and they had been computing      since the big bang, the possibilities they would have tried so far      would be less than 1 part in 1 Googol. And that does not take into      account the other 2 to the 1543+ possibilities.      There is absolutely no way to prove that any message of any possible
     length is or is not possible, without trying all of the 1 to the      470th power possibilities, which of course is impossible. As John      von Neumann once said to Dr. Bloome (Dottie), in my presence - it      in a similar but totally unrelated case, it is not enough to say      that it some theoretical message may not be theoretically possible, you      must prove that at least one specific message is not possible.  Of      course, like JvN's case, that is not possible in the case of the IPG      system.       Continuing along that line, we in recognize that because we are   working with a 1544 bit key, over 2 to 1543, but someewhat less than 2   to the 1544, that we only have approximately 10 to the 478th   possibilities, that is 2 to the 1543+. Thus with a 125,000 byte message,
  we do not have 2 to 1,000,000th possible keys, but only 2 to the 1544   possible PRNG streams. Having said that, and fully recognizing that as
  incontrovertible, we invite you to test a long PRNG generated stream
  by the method, using a truly random seed of 1544 bits. You will   find over both short and long sample sizes that the "effect" is   indistinguishable from an OTP of the same length.   To facilitate this, we are including herewith: I combined all these files listed below under BSD UNIX with the zip program so you shouldn't have any problems extracting them. If you do,
please get back in touch with us and we can re-send the file under a different format, PKZIP. Note: The zipped files are considerably larger than the original       because they are random unzippable data files.
I promise you that with these, you can write the program to generate the PRNG streams in somewhat less than two hours. I am referring to the
64 sets of the equations set out above:
This approach will  also demonstrate how incredibly fast the system is and also how incredibly secure it is.  Therefore, please find attached in the zipped file BINARY.ZIP
 consisting of:
   1. BPRIMES.DAT - 384 prime numbers used for randomly selecting the       B1,..,B64 values in what we are now calling the 1792 bit system - I       am including 384 instead of 319 in case you want to try variations..    2. CPRIMES.DAT - 384 prime numbers used for randomly selecting the
      C1,..,C64 values in the 1792 bit system - again 384 in case yopu       want to try variations.
   3. 32 - 1792 BYTE Hardware generated OTPs, specifically        OTP.001,..,OTP.032. - any of these may be used in the 1792 BIT       system, or the 5600 BIT system, or the 12288 BIT system. Further,       any of the 32, can be used for other possible system       configurations. The L1792 BYTE OTPs, can also be broken down       into 8 - 1792 BIT OTPs.
With these variables, you will not have any problem doing any kind of test that you may desire.
As a prelude, consider, if you will, the 1st 64 bytes of the PRNG stream.
    1. Byte 1
       D is random        A1=(A1+B1) MOD C1: is where A1 is random, 8 bit, and B1 and C1 are            randomly selected  from a table of primes and become a            constant for that OTP, random seed. THE resultant A1 is some            indeterminate number between 0 and C1-1. A1 MOD 256 is            therefore likewise some random number between 0 and 255.
           There are 16,677,216 possible variations, and only 1 is the            actual.          ID=(ID+A1) AND 255. ID is random and A1 is pseudo random with            16,677,216 possible variations.
       Accordingly: by definition the new TD is random.            Now therefore: if D was used for only this equation, there            would only be 2 to the 32nd possible, 8 ID - 8 A1 - 8 B1            & 8 C1 possible variations and what you would have would            be a system partioned into 64 didfferent subsystems. However,
           that is obviously not the case, D is passed from one            equation set to the next, so there is no repeat possible until at            the very least  ID short of the entire C1*C2,..*C63*C64 cycles.
     2. Byte 2, The process is the same and the resultant ID is         random.
     The process is the same for all the other 62 bytes.      Accordingly, how is it possible to determine the first 512 bits of the      PRNG stream? That is 10 to the 158th power possibilities. Obviously      they cannot all be tried - and any of the possible 2 to the 512th      power of underlying clear text is possible.      As stated, the reultant system is absolutely unbreakable - no ifs,      no ands, no buts, no maybes, no anything. Also, as you can clearly      demonstrate for yourself, there is no more robust system, with      respect to speed, possible. It is truly Ultima, the ultimate      system, as you will find out for yourself.        Enough, I assume. After you have satisfied yourself that the ABC      Encryption system is absolutely unbreakable and the fastest system      possible. We will proceed to the demonstrate that the Key      distribution is no problem and as stated, we are willing to license       the process as desired by users.   I invite your response,
  Thanks so much,
  Ralph,

I think they mean ADD not AND but it's still an odd thing to do IMHO.
Agreed.   Given that most PC apps generate known headers on files
and that only a smallish plaintext is needed it's looks rather weak.
