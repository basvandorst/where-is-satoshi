With your indulgence I would like to post this short essay here, which was
stimulated by a recent report posted on this list that was passed on to me.
The essay just ran as an op-ed piece in this week's issue of Communications
Week. I would like to thank and acknowledge the author off the original
report as well as encourage the cypherpunk community to keep me posted on
related issues. (I cannot keep up with the volume on this list and, hence,
am not a subscriber.)
Thank you,
Bill Frezza
