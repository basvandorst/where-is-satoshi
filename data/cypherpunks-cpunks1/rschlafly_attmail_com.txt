@_subject: Kocher's RSA attack 
I read Kocher's paper, but I question its applicability.  One of his
premises is that the time of a modular multiplication varies with
the data.  I've checked my code for modular multiplication, and
the clock cycles to execute don't depend on the data at all.  The
same instructions get executed, and assuming the processor has a
hardware multiply, they take the same time.
When I timed the modular multiplication, I was able to detect some
slight variation, but I attribute this to cache misses, as the variance
with the same data was the same as the variance with different data.
Apparently RSAREF has modular multiplies which vary significantly
with the data, but I maintain this is not necessary.
A good test case for his analysis might be to pull a secret key
from a smart card.  If, say, the Capstone chip modular multiplication
has some timing anomalies, this might be a good way to defeat the
Fortezza card.

@_subject: RSA Data v. Cylink hearing 
Another hearing in the public-key patent saga.
Cylink/CKC is going for a preliminary injunction against RSA Data
for contributory infringement of the Stanford patents.
RSA Data has a license to the Stanford patents, but has no sublicensing
authority.  It has been selling RSA & Diffie-Hellman toolkits and
telling customers that they don't need PKP or Stanford patent
licenses, and even indemnifying those customers against a patent
infringement claim.
An arbiter has already ruled that RSA Data's license does not cover
customers shipping products.
Of course I take the position that these patents are invalid, and
now that Bidzos has lost control of them, he suddenly agrees with me.
(Sorry, no ruling yet in my case.  Stay tuned.)  But RSA Data lawyers
will have to stand up in court and say that after enforcing the
Stanford patent against all public-key users for 5 years, RSA Data
suddenly had a revelation that the Stanford patents are invalid
after all.  It should be amusing.

Hearing on the validity of the public key patents
On Wed., Dec. 6, 1995, 10:00 am, San Jose Federal Bldg, there will
be a hearing on the validity of the Diffie-Hellman, Hellman-Merkle,
RSA, and Schnorr patents.
There are also some annoying procedural technicalities that are
also scheduled to be heard, so we may not get to the patents
right away.  (antitrust standing, sufficiency of pleadings,
admissibility of evidence, etc.)
Schlafly v. Public Key Partners & RSA Data Security
Case C-94-20512 SW PVT
Hon. Spencer Williams
At the San Jose federal building, 280 S First St.
Ask the US Marshals where Williams' courtroom is while you go thru
the airport-style security.
Court Clerk: 408/535-5364
The Federal Bldg is in downtown San Jose, between 101, 880, and 280.
I will take 280 to SJ, go north on 87, right on the first exit, and
park in the first convenient lot or garage.  There is some street
parking, but the SJ meter maids are very efficient.  If you come
from the north, you may want to take 87 or the Almaden Expwy.  (I get
those mixed up.)
The judge is used to lawyers wearing suits, so try to wear something
that won't appear disrespectful.

@_subject: PKP Lawsuit progress report 
I have a lawsuit against Public Key Partners and RSA Data Security.
(Schlafly v. PKP & RSA, Case C-94-20512 SW PVT.)
(1) PKP has been ordered dissolved by an arbiter.  The MIT patent
returns to RSA Data Security, and the Stanford patents go under the
control of Cylink.  I am happy to report that my lawsuit contributed
to this outcome.
(2) I will soon be deposing:
I will be asking all the obvious questions.  My purpose is to break
their patents.  Does anyone have anything special for me to ask?
If so, please send me your ideas.
(3) There will be a hearing on the patent validity (and a couple of
annoying technical legal issues) at 10:00 am, Dec. 6, 1995, in the

@_subject: DSS patent license 
Yes, I had such a lawsuit.  No, it didn't go anywhere in the courts,
but the feds did eventually cave in to the principal demand of my
suit: That the DSA patent be made available to anyone on a royalty-free
So how is it that RSADSI and Cylink/CKC claim you need licenses to
their patents to use DSS?  Because they have other patents.  I have
another lawsuit directed at those patents.  Stay tuned.

Re: Schlafly v. Public Key Partners & RSA Data Security
I am deposing the inventors, but there are apt to be some loose
ends that I will need to tie down and I may need some expert
testimony.  I'd like to have someone
* with expertise in public key crypto
* with some impressive-sounding credentials
* willing to volunteer to help break some patents
Any suggestions?

@_subject: Pub Key patent update 
The battle over the public key patents continues, with no end in sight.
Recent events:
* Cylink tried to get a preliminary injunction against RSADSI shipping
BSAFE for contributory infringement of the Stanford patents.  The judge
denied it, saying there was doubt about the validity of Diffie-Hellman
and about the scope of Hellman-Merkle.
* Cylink is appealing the preliminary injunction denial to the Federal
* Cylink's lawsuit to break the MIT RSA patent on obviousness and other
grounds is scheduled to goto trial on July 9 before an LA judge.  I don't
know where the trial will be held.
* RSADSI had a license to the Stanford patents dating back to around
1987, and it argues that it covers BSAFE customers.  Cylink recently
demanded a 5% royalty, and when RSADSI refused, Cylink unilaterally
terminated the license.  Cylink is now adding a direct infringement
claim against RSADSI.
* RSADSI and PKP motions for dismissal of my charges have left most
of them intact.  In particular, the antitrust charge is still alive.
* My motion for summary judgment on the invalidity of the patents is
technically still pending, but the judge shows no sign of ruling
anytime soon.  If my arguments were either clearly correct or clearly
incorrect, he would have ruled by now.  I cannot predict what will happen.
* Trial on the Stanford patents is likely this summer.  RSADSI is
trying to postpone it.

@_subject: 5th protect password? 
Is this really an issue?  I am not an expert, but I just read a
Supreme Court case:
   DOE v. United States, 487 U.S. 201; 108 S. Ct. 2341 (1988)
It involved someone who was ordered by the court to consent to the
Cayman Islands bank to turn over account records.  The Supreme
Court said yes, because it is "more like 'be[ing] forced to
surrender a key to a strongbox containing incriminating documents'
than it is like 'be[ing] compelled to reveal the combination to
[petitioner's] wall safe.'"
The quote refers to Stevens' dissent, which said:
   A defendant can be compelled to produce material evidence that
   is incriminating.  Fingerprints, blood samples, voice
   exemplars, handwriting specimens, or other items of physical
   evidence may be extracted from a defendant against his will.
   But can he be compelled to use his mind to assist the
   prosecution in convicting him of a crime?  I think not.  He may
   in some cases be forced to surrender a key to a strongbox
   containing incriminating documents, but I do not believe he can
   be compelled to reveal the combination to his wall safe -- by
   word or deed.
I conclude that in a criminal case, all of the supreme court
justices agree that a criminal defendant cannot be forced to
reveal the combination to a wall safe, or any other information in
his mind, by the Fifth Amendment.
An escrow agent can presumably be compelled, unless his is accused
of a crime, or has a privilege, or is outside jurisdiction.
Interestingly, a footnote in the above case said:
   The Government of the Cayman Islands maintains that a compelled
   consent, such as the one at issue in this case, is not
   sufficient to authorize the release of confidential financial
   records protected by Cayman law.
Sounds like the Cayman Islands might be a good place for your key
escrow agents.

@_subject: Clipper 
I don't think "pro-Clipper" properly characters the enemy.
Clipper is chip used in a voluntary federal standard.  If we had
sufficient civil liberties guarantees, I bet even a lot of
c'punks wouldn't object to govt agencies using clipper chips.
But the Freeh/Denning position, as I understand it, is that:
* privacy is not a right
* the govt should routinely spy on citizens
* strong crypto should be illegal
* no public debate on the underlying issues
Are there other computer scientists with this position?

@_subject: Stanford patents 
A couple of minor corrections.  Diffie-Hellman doesn't expire until
Sept. 6, 1997.  Cylink can sue anyone at any time, for infringement
up to 6 years in the past.  It is not likely to do so while its case
against RSADSI is pending, because most of the infringers are RSADSI
customers who have been indemnified by RSADSI.  ElGamal won't be free
of patent claims until Hellman-Merkle expires, a month after Diffie-
ElGamal/DSA is an attractive alternative to RSA, and ought to be more
widely used.
More information about the patent lawsuit can be found at:
There are some hearings scheduled, but nothing of great significance
has been decided so far.

@_subject: court order required for keys? 
Posted online news accounts of the McCain-Kerrey bill have implied
that the a court order is required under the bill to get keys.  Eg,
from recent postings,
    [AP, 07/09/1997]
    As with wiretaps, authorities would have to obtain court orders to make
    the keys available for law enforcement.     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    ... Sponsored by Kerrey and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., that bill would set
    up a key recovery system to give computer companies strong incentives to
    make keys available to investigators who obtain a court's permission.
                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    [Wired, 11.Jul.97]
    Law enforcement could then access that copy of your key
    through a court order.
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
I find this distressing, because I have read the bill, and a court order
is most emphatically NOT required.  Only a form specified by J. Reno.
This is a tricky point in the bill, but notice that:
(1) Court orders are not required for wiretaps in the US.  While it may
be true that court orders are used most of the time when wiretap evidence
is used in a criminal trial, there are a number of exceptions.
(2) There is no restriction in the bill to getting keys to decipher
communications covered by the wiretap laws.  It lets cops get keys
to many other communications.  Part of the point to using
encryption is to use public networks where access to the encrypted
data need not be hidden or withheld from the public.  Under S.909,
if the cops can get access to the data, then they can get the keys
without any court order.
(3) Even if there is a court-ordered wiretap, there is no obligation
to notify the judge that keys will also be seized.  While it may seem
obvious that if a judge is willing to order a wiretap, he is willing
to order key seizure, I don't think this is necessarily the case.
When a judge orders a wiretap, he is supposed to be balancing the
possibility of getting incriminating evidence against the invasion of
privacy of innocent parties.  If the keys of innocent parties are being
seized as well, it may affect the judge's balancing.
(4) In S.909, all of the requirements on law enforcement officials
can be lifted by executive order.
Am I wrong, or are all the news accounts wrong?  Please let me know
if there is any flaw in my analysis.
