Reply-To: Graham Toal Note that pizzabox.demon.co.uk [158.152.8.236] doesn't tell where it got
the message from.  Could it have been longs.lance.colostate.edu?  I
liked Detweiler better when he just used anon.penet.fi.
P.S. I sent myself a test email by telnetting to pizzabox.demon.co.uk
25, but it identified the IP address I telnetted from... hopefully the
site administrators at demon.co.uk have recognized the problem and taken
steps to prevent further detweiling.  But be on your lookout, this will
only hold him off until he can find another SMTP port to spoof from.

Congrats to the guys who broke the netscape encryption.  Now... as
someone who would like to use 'lite' encryption for a few non-critical
purposes, has anyone taken the code they must have worked out
to do the crack and fed it back in to a public domain server?  I
*really* don't want to pay Netscape 1000's just to play around
with this stuff...  (I presume the algorithms are public and
there wouldn't be any legal problem with this...)
PS Yes, I'm back.  Was avoiding all cypherpunkly things until I
got my green card.  First thing I did when it arrived in the mail
was log in to MIT and get an official release of pgp :-)
