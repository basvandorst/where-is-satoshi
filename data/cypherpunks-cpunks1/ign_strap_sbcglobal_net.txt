@_subject: Wikipedia and Responsibility (Weinstein, RISKS-24.72) 
* Immediate irresponsible editing, hugely magnified by Google, drives
  Wikipedia.
* Wikipedia survives through advanced blame-shifting.  (Credit Seth
  Finkelstein for that insight.)
Changing either would destroy Wikipedia.
Why that won't happen:
* "One character who's laughing all the way to the bank, though, is Wales
  himself."9
* "Almost all of Wikipedia's 1,000-odd "administrators" receive no pay for
  their hard work other than the pleasure of power tripping - seeing nothing
  of the $14m of VC money Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales has banked."2
