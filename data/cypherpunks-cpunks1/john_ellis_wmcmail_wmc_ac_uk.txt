Does anyone have the source code for PGP (DOS) not Unix,

   I've tried to find out the answers to my
questions myself but I haven't been very successful. Actually, I haven't been successful at all.  First of all,
I've been using PGP on my computer but when I tried to port it over to my unix account it didn't work.  I took the source code and tried to compile it using the unix g++ compiler but it gave me all of these errors.  Where can I find PGP that is already compiled for unix or at the very least will compile for unix? Secondly, if I create a program that makes using PGP more
user friendly can I let other people have it ( for FREE )? Lastly, what is considered overkill with cryptography?
I don't believe anything is.  My programs accept what the user inputs for how large prime numbers should be ( my public
key programs ) but I make them able to accept values that go up to 30720 bits ( I don't believe a number can ever be large enough ).  You can never be to safe...never.
