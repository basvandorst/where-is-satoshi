@_subject: Blowfish Performance 
David Stoler recently commented:
Actually this (slow key expansion) is a feature. It limits the
speed of a brute-force attack, since each new key to be tried
must be expanded.
What applications need to change keys more than once a second?
I'd also be interested in comparisons of Blowfish to IDEA.

@_subject: Encrypting Hard Disks 
- - From a quick perusal of the above web site, it appears as though
F-Secure Desktop offers encryption by file, much like PGP does, only a
little more automatic.  But an entire encrypted file must be decrypted
before you can process it and the entire file must then be
re-encrypted if it is updated.
- - From     With the built-in AutoSecure(TM) feature, you can define sets of
    files, directories, and Windows 95 folders that will be
    automatically encrypted and decrypted every time you start or
    close Windows.
- - From this, it appears encrypted files are decrypted while windows is
open. Obviously if Windows crashes a lot of plaintext files can be
left lying around!
I prefer the methods of SecureDrive
  or Secure Device
  ftp://utopia.hacktic.nl/pub/replay/pub/disk/secdev14.arj
in which data is decrypted "on-the-fly" as it is transferred from
disk to memory.  The data is -always- encrypted on the disk. Both of
the above use strong IDEA encryption (same as PGP) and both are
free for non-commercial use. (Commercial use is possible by paying a
small royalty to the holders of the IDEA patent; see
  In contrast, F-Secure Desktop is $99 a copy.

@_subject: Any more like www.anonymizer.com ?? 
Does anyone have a list of web proxies for anonymous surfing?
I already know about  and there was a
"canadianizer" that would alter text to make it more "Canadian",
but that is now apparently defunct.
Reason I need to know, a friend in a foreign country has to deal
with a web proxy that blocks "objectionable" sites including
 so some alternates that might not be blocked
would be welcome.

SCIENTISTS PROPOSE NEW ENCRYPTION SCHEME
Two scientists at the IBM Almaden Research Center in San Jose,
Calif.  have developed a new approach to public key cryptography
based on mathematical constructs called lattices.  The system
would be based on a particular set of hidden hyperplanes that
constitute the private key and a method of generating points near
one of those hyperplanes for the public key.  The security of the
system rests on the computational difficulty of finding the
"unique" shortest line segment (or vector) that connects any two
points in a given lattice -- a task that's fairly easy in two or
three dimensions, but much more difficult in a 100-dimensional
lattice.  The researchers are working to turn their theory into a
marketable product, and see applications in creating digital
signatures and other security and authentication schemes.
