Why not introduce a "grill week", John? A shaking of the bones. A weekly
virtual bowel-movement.  One for the bandits, one for the hyenas, one for
the rotters, one for the vultures, the leeches, and so on.... Tim would be so happy to contribute, wouldn't you Tim?

One of the many salutory if unsavory aspects of cypherpunks is that a fresh
proposal is more likely to be disagreed with than supported, rabid-dog
disagreement cloaking theft and plagiarism.
Rotters will then go off to get something done with stolen material, most
will remain to shrewly pretend to demolish whatever "cluelessness" shows up,
to asymmetrically burgle and secretize openness loot like official spies.
Lacking cluelessness to taunt into full disclosure the bandits will brag of
prowess, refer auto-didactly to misunderstood, unread sources (some
fictional hidden by errant URLs), throw out poisoned baited code, cackle at
the writhing suckers who bite the freebie and foolishly insert as covert
backdoor, but never admit having been hooked repeatedly, instead pay ahead
the pain of gullibility, lesson learned from distinguished computer
professors and OS-backdoored Middle East negotiators.
Does this remind of Assange among several ignotables who went off-list to
reshape the world as "life-changing"
endeavor? And who may or may not be among current hyenas here lying in wait
for fresh carrion like Bell, CJ, Manning, Swartz, BBrown, Anonymous,
Lulzsec, Sabu, Appelbaum, Gonggrijp, Jonsdottir, Snowden, Poitras,
Greenwald, the list of vanity-incomsec-diseased ever lengthens.
The dozen or so best and brightest will fail at their incomsec ventures,
hoodwinked by better and brighter vultures preying on red meat wizards
incompetent at asymmetrical financial math with dreams of lucrative public
interest benefits fronted by sterling reputations. RSA, PGP, NSA
venture-backdooring susceptible.

How about refusing any Tor traffic (as the EU already does), irrespective of
the used protocol, encrypted or not?
1. invent Tor
2. subsidize it
3. privatize it
4. force target traffic to use Tor
5. kill Tor access at nsp level
6. finish off remnants
If I'm correct Shava Nerad (ex-EFF) had a while ago some quite perky
pointers in that direction.
... Oh, cool.  I was going for more paranoid than that - if you're an email
provider and the NSA has given you an order to retain all data and rat out
all your customers, theoretically you don't even want to accept that much,
but if it's feeding into Tor or some remailer anyway, non-PGP mail won't get
very far, and you're less likely to be the kind of service provider who gets
NSA/FISA orders.
