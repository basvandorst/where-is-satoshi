@_subject: WARNING: Forward of unposted alt.config message 
I am sending this here _prior_ to posting it to give advance
warning; responses received have varied on the methods of
creation of the group, but have largely tended toward a consensus
that it is wise to have some sort of discussion period; in
addition, I have chosen a cross-post to those groups most likely
to have an interest in creating the group, and if this results
in a flamewar in alt.config, so be it.  After I tally the votes
and they vastly outnumber the NOs I will create the newsgroup
without further delay.  I just wish for people to clarify; sorry
if you missed it, but this is going out in four hours exactly to
the aforementioned newsgroups.  I will implement all important
suggestions mailed to me by that time, including alteration of
procedural points, wording changes, alteration of Newsgroups:
line, etc.  I will also delay posting if valid and immediate
concerns are brought to light; however, since I leave the major axes:  Moderated or unmoderated, length of discussion
period, length of voting period, open for discussion, it should
not be a disaster if it goes out in its current form.  Join
the discussion, and if you like the idea, PLEASE send a YES
vote only WHEN the Call for Votes is posted.
Additionally, suggestions for additions/deletions of Newsgroups
from the crosspost, or a more appropriate place to
redirect replies, or any suggestions whatever will be adopted
if suitable.
If you have no interest in the privacy issue, please type 'd' now.
Newsgroups: alt.config, alt.privacy, alt.privacy.anon-server, soc.motss, alt.sex, alt.sex.bestiality, alt.drugs, comp.protocols.tcp-ip.eniac
Followup-to: alt.config
In light of the current debate concerning whether anonymous posting
can serve a useful purpose, I propose the immediate experiment of creating
a group which shall provide a genuinely useful service to the
public.  This newsgroup is to be called alt.whistleblower, and is for the purpose
of allowing those who might otherwise be unwilling to come forward to
provide information about the illegal activities of government
agencies, large corporations and similar malefactors without fear
of illegal reprisals against them.
The need for this group is evident in light of the extreme usefulness
of information concerning the behavior of the governing bodies of
the United States, and the large number of government employees and
corporate employees with access to the Internet and anonymous posting
This group could also include reports of illegal discrimination
by those who fear reprisal if they reveal their names, information
concerning safety issues by those who know that their company is
releasing an unsafe or dangerous product, or defrauding customers
by dishonest and illegal means.
Considering the immediate need for this newsgroup in light of
those who, in many cases, provide services for a fee and then
provide an inadequate service by cutting their downstream sites
from reading anything that the service-provider deems is inappropriate,
I request a waiver of procedure in this matter and that, if significant
interest is present and seems to form a general consensus, it shall
be accepted that I revise and present a prospectus for this newsgroup and a call for votes on a date no sooner than seven days from
this initial posting and no later than ten days after the call
for discussion.  Procedural points concerning the length of the
voting period are to be addressed in the public discussion, and
anyone wishing to send anonymous mail should forward it to me.
This newsgroup is necessary and of great potential
use, as those of you with a legitimate need for privacy
know well.  If you value your privacy, let us discuss this
wisely and equitably in order to reach a consensus.   Whether this newsgroup is to be moderated or unmoderated,
whether the name is appropriate or another hierarchy would
be preferable, and all procedural points are to be decided
based on the general consensus.
I realize there will be those who will oppose the creation
of this newsgroup on the oft-cited grounds that "Anyone who
needs privacy must be hiding something."
This is true; however, in our society there are many things
which need to be revealed as well as many things which need
to be concealed.
I believe that a corollary truism could be applied to those
who oppose the notion of public privacy.  "Anyone who
fears privacy must be hiding something."
Let the discussion begin.
Final note:  Do NOT, repeat, NOT send votes until I post
a "Call for Votes" at the end of the discussion period.  The
length of the discussion period may be increased if some
drastic occurrence requires it, but I'm planning to post
it in one week.  Vote then.  I thank you for your consideration
in this matter.

Perhaps it is; this is why I'm sending it out for discussion instead
of just newgrouping it.
Actually, it is more my act, which I decided upon based on memes
I received partially from this list; the cypherpunks, if they do
choose to support the idea, will do it individually; and, as yet,
I have not had the arrogance to make a public announcement to
the effect that the cypherpunks made this action.  My name only
is attached to this; no praise, no blame.
Well, it might not; there are a number of potential hurdles, like
the possibility that it will turn into a mindless narc fest; my
personal opinion as to this is that I would prefer to leave the
group unmoderated, but with an _option_ to moderate if the worst
occurs.  Of _course_ this will be abused, but I believe that it will
also be used.
This will provide an empirical basis for our principles.  Success
or failure will determine whether hypotheses need to be revised,
or if they do, in fact, have predictive capability.
Well, if people are careful, and don't log in to an anonymous server
_from_ an account with their name, but from an anonymous dataswitch,
all Bell or the Department of Housing and Urban Development would
know is that someone who works for them posted this anonymous message;
which they knew already.  Of course, anything beyond the first posting
would be tracable if someone really wanted to do it, but what would it
prove, unless they traced it to that person?  Another possibility is to go primitive and use snailmail, digitize
images and data or type in by hand.  Without very specific reasons,
opening U S Mail is not condoned.
You may be right.  I may not be orthodox cypherpunk.  However, with the proliferation of retroactive posting cancellation
of anonymous posts, I believe it is possible to be patient to so
great an extent that one calmly and rationally discusses a situation
until the moment when action would have been useful has passed; in other words, you've discussed battle strategy until the enemy's won.
Again, I believe that you _can_ be quiet and develop tools.  It
is good that this is being done by _somebody_.  However, I take issue with your assertion that a formal Request
for Discussion, worded in a non-inflammatory manner, is a juvenile
"FUCK YOU!"  If you doubt this, check out the RFD when it appears
in news.announce.newgroups.  What little temperature was in it
was deleted; I spent about three hours implementing the suggestions
of others and cut the verbiage by a half.  I do not see how this can damage what foundation we have;
essentially a few software packages and an ideology.
However, to protect from just this occurence, I did not present
my viewpoints as cypherpunk viewpoints in the announcement, merely
as my own.
The word 'cypherpunk' does not occur anywhere in the article.
If cypherpunks wish to discuss this group, why it would be a good
or bad idea, or if it would be better-named, it may be discussed.
If it is decided that the idea should be shelved, then so be it.
I, and we, shall bide our time, and create it as an alt.group
in the meantime.
Very likely, at least in the beginning, privacy will be provided
by the person who wishes to have it, and that person will take
responsibility for the consequence of his or her actions.
Check out the discussion.  Let the net decide.

@_subject: WARNING: Pointer article to soc.whistleblowers debate 
The news software has been activated.
David Tale has accepted the article, sans a paragraph specifying
a procedural point (which I didn't think would fly, anyway) and
bagging alt.sex and alt.drugs from the discussion, but keeping
many others; I think if I hadn't put those two in, he might have
knocked out a few I was serious about.
So, in any case, the article, in a modified form, partially by
me and partially by Tale, is now posted to news.announce.newgroups,
and the debate shall begin shortly.
Those of you who consider this newsgroup a beneficial and good
thing, and who wish to discuss its implementation and name
and other germane issues, should immediately go to news.groups
and begin posting like lunatics.
Those of you who consider this newsgroup a menace to society
should go to news.groups and post scathing articles about my
sexual preferences.  (Humor, of course.)
In any case, I have not identified myself as a cypherpunk or,
for that matter, as an Extropian, not having the boundless arrogance
to presume that cypherpunks all share my opinion of the methods of
implementing this; so those of you who do agree with me, or disagree only on procedural points, should post your opinion;
people have a larger tendency to vote YES when they think others
agree with them.  Also try to avoid excessively inflammatory
postings (on the order of "You fucking moron, how DARE you
disagree with me."), as these will tend to garner a bunch of NOs.
I don't mean be a total schmuck and bend over backwards for
a flaming, but flame back in a constructive spirit and without
senseless _ad hominem_ attacks.  I hope that this group can be created with as little
sturm and drang as possible, but if it _does_ require
sturm OR drang OR both, heat may need to be applied.
Again, post whether or not you agree.  And don't send votes
yet, of course.  I'll just junk them, according to net.law.
If the cypherpunks wish to present this as a cypherpunk issue,
or if individuals wish to support it as individuals, feel free.
I'm not going to attach the name 'cypherpunk' to it myself
because, not to be rude, it would further politicize an already
highly-politicized issue.  However, if we'd be more effective
as THE DREADED Extropians/Cypherpunks bloc, which I don't think
is necessarily the case, feel free.  It's not my net.  Apologies are extended for the lengthy crosspost, but it shall
be the last crosspost; further discussion ought to occur in
news.groups.  And battle plans in cypherpunks, if we even need
battle plans.  With any luck, there won't be a battle.
If we sneak this in by acclamation without a flamewar or
controversy, we're ENTRENCHED.  NOBODY can stop us, or any
other people who could utilize this most valuable resource.
But I'm not holding my breath on that one. Although I cross-posted mainly to groups with a large population
of potential YES voters, and ignored, say, news admin hangouts,
those who would oppose this are sure to find out about it; but
I think we can muster sufficient political clout to pass this.
Me?  I'm currently going to enlist some old friends from talk.bizarre. . .
Don't worry, they're not the current crop but the same crowd that
passed comp.protocols.tcp-ip.eniac.  I'll ask for as little
inflammatory material as possible, like I did here, but I
don't want this to become any more of a flamewar than necessary,
and, again and for the last time, would prefer it didn't end
up that way at all.
End of crosspost.  We now return you to your regular round
of discussing radix sorts and monozygotic recessives.
Thank you. Robert W. Clark

@_subject: My letter to the President, for all the good it'll do 
Well, this and fifty cents will get you a cup of coffee, but
here's my letter to the Pres.
I oppose the Clipper chip vehemently.  As the President, or the
duly authorized representative of the President, you will understand
that I find the idea that you will monitor my communications
reprehensible and intolerable.
You have espoused a policy of covert surveillance of
American citizens of which Bush would be proud.  You, a protester
of the Vietnam War, who understands that the government can, and
should be opposed when it is wrong, should understand why privacy
is necessary to the people of any democracy, lest it cease to
be a democracy.  Nevertheless, you approved the Clipper Chip proposal,
which is the furthest step backward that even a politician could take.
Shame on you!  Even George Bush's father, Prescott Bush, who despised
and opposed Senator McCarthy's Communist witch-hunt, would loathe
such a retrogressive move!
We computer professionals, who supported your rise to power, feel
betrayed by your sudden reversal, by no means unique among your
sudden reversals.  By siding with those who would rob Americans
of those freedoms which are our inalienable right, you have betrayed
democracy and made a sham of the Bill of Rights.  If, as a White House official suggested, criminalizing alternative,
secure encryption standards is an "option on the table," I am disgusted
by your betrayal.  You, who seemed proud to have protested an unjust
war, and should understand why protest, even anonymous protest, should
be an inalienable right, have no right even to consider this as an option.  If you consider criminalizing privacy, and encryption, you have
signed over the soul of the nation to be monitored at will by the
NSA and CIA, organizations which you, at one time in your life, opposed.
Perhaps, like many Sixties rebels, you have been bought by the
government, and no longer care about the rights of the American people.
It would not be the only time this has occurred.
While I doubt that you, the President, shall read this, perhaps some
subordinate shall.  Perhaps, if the miraculous is possible, that subordinate shall deem this worthy of your consideration.  While I am not used to pleading, I plead that you reconsider this
policy, which, if enacted, would doom privacy in the United States,
and turn this nation into the sort of nation that the Soviet Union
has finally decided not to be.
I beg that you consider, at least for a moment, the evil that you
may unleash.  You may be motivated by an understandable concern for
the protection of the American people from drug dealers and mobsters,
but it is not the mobsters you shall crush in supporting the Clipper
chip.  It is those eager, agile young minds who oppose the government
when it is wrong, and only wish to be able to have their voice,
without being monitored by the CIA and NSA in case that voice occasionally
is overly strident.
Thank you, Mr. President.  I hope that you have carefully studied
the holy Consitution of this nation, which you have sworn to uphold.
I fear for the consequences if you have not.

@_subject: Forward of my message to CERT 
Dear Moira,
I was somewhat disturbed to note the recent actions of CERT with
regard to Johan Helsingius' site anon.penet.fi; and with
regard to the cypherpunks' archive at soda.berkeley.edu.  I read a clarification of your position which appeared to regret
any inconvenience these actions and others may have caused, it
still seemed that you do not intend to exercise any more caution
in the phrasing of your message.  While the message disclaims
that you have verified the information included in it, it still
bears the phrasing of an accusation, not an advisory.
While it is certainly laudable to bring potential security problems
to the attention of system administrators and users, the method
in which this was done, and those to whom you mentioned it, cause
me serious doubts as to the effectiveness of your actions.
In the first case, that of Johann Helsingius, you did not notify
the system administrator but the domain manager for all Finland.
Not only is the domain manager in no position to patch potential
security holes in a local system, but additionally he probably
has more important tasks than checking out false reports.
Allegations were made by an unnamed officer of CERT that the
site was illegally distributing software by anonymous ftp; whereas,
even the most rudimentary efforts at verification would have revealed that
the site in question does not operate anonymous ftp.
It is neither sensible nor equitable to contact a domain
administrator without even contacting the administrator of the questionable
system; especially the domain administrator of an entire sovereign
nation.  Certainly, if CERT can not even bother to take the time of
even a preliminary verification of their reports before announcing them,
certainly it seems to be an imposition to demand that the domain
administrator of an entire country spend time investigating spurious
If there is suspicion that a particular machine has been compromised,
and is thus an insecure method of contacting the administrator, perhaps
contacting the administrator by postal mail or by telephone would
be more sensible than contacting the administrator of all the machines
in Finland.  Certainly if the machine itself is compromised, it is
quite possible that the entire domain is also compromised, and email
may be insecure and easily available to hostile third parties.
With the additional implication in the ominous form letter you mail
that the person responsible for the machine may be involved in illegal
activities, the potential for abuse of CERT by people filing false
reports is, though perhaps not in itself a "computer emergency,"
is certainly something which you ought to consider in your standard
As sites which use TCP/IP without providing for authentication are
considered security holes, so is a Computer Emergency Response Team
which does the same thing, that is, simply relays accusations
without any authentication of their veracity.  Considering the possible damage to the reputations of persons not
involved in illegal activity, and the disruption of services which
results when such accusations are made, actions of this sort are
retrogressive and represent as significant a threat to the systems
as would a 'denial of service' attack.
Please be more careful in the future when relaying such messages.

@_subject: CryptoStacker (Key storage) 
The problem with this is that a hostile third party who has captured
a machine will first make a backup of all files on the system, including
the key.  It is very likely that the party will bypass the initial
bootup procedure in which the key is requested, since the hostile
party expects some sort of 'data bomb,' having been involved with
systems confiscation for quite some time.  While there are some
options available, such as disallowing bootups from floppy, these
are in the main cheap hacks not to be trusted for security.
In this case, when the system is booted and the key is requested,
even if the key is wiped, they simply restore it from backup and
try again.  They are likely to keep the system for several months,
so they will have time to conquer any 'toy-grade' security.
While it is not yet standard procedure to make a snapshot of the
system memory when confiscating systems, the increasing cleverness
of law enforcement and other bodies makes this seem likely in the
future.  So you can't have the key on the disk, nor can you have it hanging
around in cleartext in memory except when encrypted data is accessed;
preferably, the key should be encrypted, and on some fragile (i. e.,
easily destroyable) media.  Any backups should be encrypted, and
not easily accessible; preferably with a trusted party and not in
the same building as the computer with encrypted information.

ngs.lance.colostate.edu (L. Detweiler) says:
Perhaps they were prepared.  However, it seems just as likely that
they realized that there would be a vast outcry over Clipper, just
as there was over the "Digital Telephony" proposal.  They would
have to be dumber than even I consider them not even to consider the possibility of public outcry.
I'll bet they started doing this the moment that the FOIA was passed.
Why wouldn't they?  It's expedient.
Yep.  This particular quote ought to be distributed widely.
We cypherpunks have known this since the Clipper proposal reared
its monstrous head; now it's official writ, only recently declassified.
Let's make the most of it.
Well, as we've known, they're either shills or idiots.  Perhaps both.
'Incentivised' indeed.  I believe that anyone capable of using such
a revolting neologism is, _ipso facto_, untrustworthy.  Even Hollywood
people don't speak _that_ badly.
[. . .]
It's pretty appalling that they even _admit_ that it is 'trapdoor'
technology.  However, as P. T. Barnum once said:  "No one ever went
broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public."
They're probably planning some new crime already, realizing that
Clipper will be defeated.  They had Clipper in the hopper since
before Digital Telephony was defeated.
As Clipper makes Digital Telephony look like a schoolboy
prank, prepare for something genuinely monstrous in a few
months.  Probably just when we start feeling a little
complacent and victorious, too.

@_subject: The Bizdos flap 
bout all the Bizdos flap:
It is entirely possible that PKP has no sensible alternative
but to capitulate to the NSA's offer.  While Bizdos himself may
oppose the Clipper chip, it is obviously in PKP's best interest
to accept a virtual monopoly on the crypto industry.  While Bizdos' title may be "President," it is very easy for a
company to remove a "President" who makes unprofitable choices.
As has been said before, corporations have no truck with ethics.
To expect a corporate entity to behave ethically is the same as
to expect a T-cell to cease absorbing phagocytes.  It ain't in
its nature.
If one wishes PKP to behave "ethically," it is necessary for us
to make it unprofitable for PKP to behave in the manner in which
it is.  E. g. question their patents, bring suits against them,
and otherwise make PKP's existence unprofitable.  Suddenly, it will behave "ethically."
Any ideas, folks?  Don't expect help from Bizdos on it, though.

@_subject: Corporate Ethics and the Profit Margin 
[My suggestions on ways to make it unprofitable for PKP to
 behave "unethically" deleted.]
Unlike the child, though, a corporation is not human.  In addition,
it is, alas, the manner of American business of late to be reactive instead of proactive.  Thus, rather than see the future catastrophe which will inevitably result if Clipper/Capstone is
mandated as a standard, PKP will look toward this year's profit
margin.  To get the attention of an American corporation, it
is regrettably necessary to "beat it every time it misbehaves."  If it behaves, free market forces will take care of the reward.
In the case of PKP and AT & T, though, free market forces have
been subverted because they have been "incentivised" by Uncle
Sam.  ("Incentivised," ecch.  Sounds like a suitably grisly
operation, no?  Ever notice that euphemisms are usually
uglier than what they euphemise?  Even "bribe" would sound
less tawdry and criminal.)
Unfortunately, it's far easier for a large, diverse group to agree
_not_ to purchase something than get all of them to sign a group
contract to buy a certain company's merchandise.  It works, too.
Check out the Chavez grape boycott, and the alarming success of
the Moron Majority in bullying advertisers and television networks
to cancel "immoral" programming.
Unless there were a "Cypherpunks procurement committee," which purchased
crypto merchandise from "cypherpunk correct" dealers and resold to
cypherpunks, this would be difficult to manage.
It may be a good idea, but I, for one, don't have the capital
to set it up; and it doesn't seem likely to happen in the immediate
Even you, when making concrete suggestions, seem to realize that
punishment and/or negative reinforcement are effective tools,
as in your next message you write:
[Other good suggestions elided.]
This is the "whack 'em when they misbehave" tactic which you seemed to oppose in your prior message.  It's really the
main weapon in our arsenal against corporate misbehavior.

Thanks for posting it.  It is perversely pleasing to me to know someone else on the list

So that you won't feel that your anecdote was tedious, which

Thanks for sending it out; it was nicely written, and concise.

they would have got them by now.  They may just have hassled you as
