@_subject: Gilmore to speak on encryption policy at UMBC (Tues, Dec 16) 
The UMBC Security Technology Research Group presents
        Two Divergent Views on Encryption Policy:
I.  Wisdom and Constitutionality in U.S. Cryptography Policy
 John Gilmore, Co-Founder, Electronic Frontier Foundation
II. A Government Perspective on Encryption Policy
 [Will anyone from the U.S. Government agree to speak??*]
Two divergent views on the topic of encryption policy by
freedom activist John Gilmore and by a government official,
if one agrees to speak.  Journalist Peter Wayner will
moderate the event, which is free and open to the public.
  Note: If no one from the U.S. Government is willing to
explain and discuss Government encryption policy, then the
event will proceed with John Gilmore alone.
  8-10:30 pm

  Lecture Hall III (in Administration Building)
  University of Maryland Baltimore County
  The fifth employee of Sun Microsystems and a strong believer
in the U.S. Constitution, John Gilmore is currently involved

constitutionality of controlling encryption.

* The following U.S. Government officials declined to speak on December 16:
Barry Smith (Supervisory Special Agent, FBI)     [Mr. Smith has agreed in principle to speak at UMBC in the spring on
    a law enforcement view of encryption policy;  the evening of     Dec 16 turned out to be a bad time for him.]

Bob Litt (Attorney General's Office, DoJ)
Scott Charney (Computer Crimes, DoJ)
Bruce McConnell (Information Policy, OMB)
Ron Lee (General Counsel, NSA)
Dr. Clint Brooks (Director, Cryptographic Policy, NSA)

I am still hopeful to find a second speaker by Tuesday evening.
