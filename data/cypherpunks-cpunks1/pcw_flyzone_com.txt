@_subject: What happened to this NY Times article on STOA andEchelon? 
The search software at the NYT leaves much to be desired. If you
enter from the front page, it assumes you only want to search
TODAY's copy of the paper. You have to re-search and click on
the whole archives. Of course, that often yields too many
articles to wade through.
For speed, here's the index of Guissani's columns. Read them
all! (But don't collect them and post them to your own website.

Here's the article in question:

@_subject: Schneier: Why Digital Signatures are not 
Schneier's piece does a good job of listing some of the problems with digital signatures, but he really throws the baby out with the bathwater when he concludes that "Digital signatures aren't signatures." This has been his habit lately. The book _Secrets and Lies_ is filled with plenty of handwringing about how no computer security system is ever going to be good enough.
The standards he applies to digital signatures are much too severe. I think that even pen-and-ink signatures wouldn't pass, a conclusion that would lead to the strange sentence, "Signatures aren't signatures and they can't fulfill their promise."
The law is very vague about the definition of signatures. It's simply a mark that is made with the intent of binding yourself to a contract. That means the old 'X' scratched on a piece of paper can still bind the illiterate. Mathematicians and computer security folks will probably recoil in horror about the circularity of the whole scheme, but that's the best the law could develop during the pen-and-ink years.
It is certainly possible to concentrate upon the ways that digital signatures can fail. Anyone who finds out the secret key can forge signatures with impunity. Anyone who hacks into a system can sneak things past a signer. But these techniques can also work with pen-and-ink signatures. Kids frequently learn to forge their parents' signatures on notes, tests, and permission slips. Skilled forgers can be quite adept. Most managers develop a stupid quick scrawl that is simple to copy.
Pen-and-ink signatures are also easy to abuse. You can trace another signature. You can use a projector to place an image of the signature on a paper for tracing. You can cut and paste the signature using scissors and glue before you photocopy the paper. The opportunities are easy to exploit. To put it as Bruce does, a pen-and-ink signature does not authenticate the link between Alice and the paper.
To make matters worse, pen-and-ink signatures do not preclude someone from changing the inside of a contract. That's why each side of the deal keeps a copy. If one copy disappears, though, all bets are off. Anyone can insert pages, replace pages, and generally create mayhem. At least digital signatures are not this easy to subvert.
There is a well established network of signature experts who testify in court. While I guess it's sad that digital signatures will lead to a similar cadre of professional expert cryptographers, I'm not willing to simply state that digital signatures shouldn't be considered signatures. Unfortunately, this can be all that we have

According to the Daily Telegraph, the US took most of the credit for breaking Japanese codes during WWII. The paper says that Bletchley Park deserves more credit according to recently declassified papers. Only traditional British reticence kept them from claiming credit Of course, the British also stood on the shoulders of the Polish.....

@_subject: Earn Cash, Find Errors in _Disappearing Cryptography_. 
I'm working on a second edition of _Disappearing Cryptography_, a book about steganography and anonymity on-line. In the interests of removing any errors from previous editions, I'm offering a $10 reward for anyone who reports the technical errors to me.
Here are the rules:
*) Only the first person to report an error wins a prize. This is the only way to avoid many people submitting the same error again and again and again. I reserve the right to pay duplicate prizes to people who appear to have submitted a duplicate in good faith.
*) I reserve the right to decide the size of an error. If misspellings counted, spelling someone's name wrong through out the entire book would only count as one error.
*) First person is judged by the time the error arrives in my mailbox, pcw at flyzone.com.
*) Only technical errors count. Grammar and spelling errors could bankrupt me, even after the copy editing fixes 99%.
*) Please submit the page number.
*) Please let me know if you want your name included in the thanks at the beginning of the book.
Thank you. You're free to forward this offer to any other list.

@_subject: Double the Reward for Errors in _Disappearing Cryptography_ 
I'm working on a second edition of _Disappearing Cryptography_, a book about steganography and anonymity on-line. Last week, I offered a $10 reward for anyone who reports the technical errors in the first edition to me. This week I'm doubling the reward to $20 per error. Why? Because I've only gotten one report. That means there are either few errors or the incentive isn't large enough. So let's try again.
Here are the rules:
*) Only the first person to report an error wins a prize. This is the only way to avoid many people submitting the same error again and again and again. I reserve the right to pay duplicate prizes to people who appear to have submitted a duplicate in good faith. (The only one reported is on page 27 in a sentence describing the Euler Totient Function.)
*) I reserve the right to decide the size of an error. If misspellings counted, spelling someone's name incorrectly throughout the entire book would only count as one error.
*) First person is judged by the time the error arrives in my mailbox, pcw at flyzone.com.
*) Only technical errors count. Grammar and spelling errors could bankrupt me, even after the copy editing fixes 99%.
*) Please submit the page number.

@_subject: Baltimore Digital Commerce Society-- Korhammer on Lava 
This event was originally scheduled for October 2nd, but it is being pushed back to November 6th because Lava Trading used to be located on the 83rd floor of the WTC. Richard Korhammer's office was only 50 feet away from where the plane hit. Miraculously all of the company survived. Korhammer was across the street with a client during the entire event.
But please come to listen to hear about their company not about the WTC. They're almost back on-line after having their entire office destroyed.  These guys are building a very cool, cross-exchange tool. It constantly keeps track of the bids and asks on a number of exchanges letting you send your business to where the prices are best. It's fascinating to watch the screen update the quotes in real This kind of semi-automated, trading assistance is bound to become more and more prevalent. I think Lava Trading is doing some of the most interesting stuff around.

Topic: Networks as Markets-- Why Exchanges are Becoming Virtual
Richard Korhammer is the CEO of LavaTrading, one
of the startup companies in New York diving into
cross-market arbitrage. Their network links
together all of the important market makers in
ECNs and keeps track of all bids and offers.
Buyers and sellers using the technology
automatically get pointers to the best price
possible. Traders with large blocks of stock do
substantially better because Lava Trading will
break up their block to match it with the best
price available across all of the markets. This
cross-market arbitrage improves liquidity for the
market and makes it simpler for traders with large
blocks of stock to wade into the marketplace
without leaving a wake.
In his talk, Korhammer will explore how fast
networking and sophisticated servers can
supplement and potentially replace the old
fashioned stock exchange. Traders won't need to
come to one place or one exchange to search for
the best price because the network can constantly
sort through all buyers and sellers. Korhammer
believes that adding intelligence to the network
and the servers supporting is more efficient than
requiring traders to manually manage an otherwise
complicated marketplace.
Will these cross-exchange tools supplant the
exchange? Will they eventually become the
exchange? Will the disintermediation eventually
make all trading a transparent event?

@_subject: An assault on liberty? 
I realize that many will use this event as an excuse for many political agendas, but I think it's important that we think through exactly what happened. It doesn't seem like it was an assault on liberty or a misuse of the liberties we have. Most people can't fly planes. The learning process is long and the licensing requirements are many. Flying a 757 is even more restricted by both cost and licensing requirements. It's not a liberty like walking around the streets or speaking one's mind.
It doesn't seem to me that this attack had anything to do with liberty. It's not like someone abused the right to bear arms by shooting someone, it's not like someone abused the right to speak freely by libeling someone, it's not like someone abused the right to drink alcohol by plowing into a school bus after drinking too much. These guys were unauthorized to have knives, they were unauthorized to have bombs, they were unauthorized to fly 757s, they were probably unauthorized to be in the country. Yet they did all of these despite the controls.
The hard lesson is that controls don't always work. Licensing requirements, security checkpoints, and armed guards fail. It's sad, but there's no physical law like gravity that we can depend upon to keep ourselves safe.
If you ask me, the biggest danger is that we'll add more ineffective security measures in the hopes of doing something.  And the real problem is the controls may never be enough to keep us safe.

@_subject: bounty for errors in _Translucent Databases_ 
I'm starting work on the second edition of  _Translucent Databases_. To
help eliminate errors, I'm quadrupling the bounty for error reports to
$20 per error. I may also pay for suggestions for improving it, but
that's harder to codify.
For info on the book, see this website:
The only rules are designed to prevent people from using this offer to
print money: only the first person to report each error gets $20. I
reserve the right to relax this rule to pay multiple people who don't
seem to be colluding. I get to decide what constitutes an technical
error and how big an error might be. For instance, if I screwed up and
listing pi=3.41592..., I get to decide that this is only one error.
It's not an infinite set of errors because the first digit after the
decimal point is not 4, the second digit is not 1, the third digit is
not 5, etc. Also, non-technical errors don't qualify, although I'm
grateful to get them.
To see previously reported errors:
I promise to try to apply these rules as generously as possible.
