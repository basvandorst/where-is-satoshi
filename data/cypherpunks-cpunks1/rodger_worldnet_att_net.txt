You bring up a point that is implied - but not explicit - in the article.
And it's a good one. Funny thing is, two of the _industry_ folks suggested
individuals probably needed to be included in the document more than they
were. Neither was keen on being quoted on the record regarding non-business
interests, of course.
Given the attitude of the folks I talked to, I suspect non-business
interests are still fairly important to the White House on this one. And remember: Ira Magaziner won no friends in industry with his health care
proposals a couple of years back; some folks think he's leaning in favor of
industry at least initially to make sure what happened then doesn't happen
If Netizens find suggestions from the administration too heavy-handed, my
guess is there's still time to move the discussion.

Administration Supporter Having Second Thoughts On Encryption Plan
By Will Rodger 1:30 PM EDT
Nixon went to China. Constantine converted to Christianity. Napoleon crowned himself emperor.
So why can't Dorothy Denning be a cypherpunk?
That's the question encryption mavens ask as the Georgetown University computer scientist slowly lets the word out: She won't back government plans for key recovery, key escrow or anything else alleged to increase national security until backers show that the benefits of controls on encryption outweighs those of letting free market forces govern its use.
That's a far cry from the way she once talked about encryption technology. As recently as this year Denning was pegged as a strong backer of keeping controls on a wide range of computer-security products.
"Maybe export controls should be lifted," Denning said. "But I'm not saying that all controls should be lifted. I've gotten into a state where I don't know and I'm not sure that I ever knew."
Denning may be the only prominent cryptographer to support government control of encryption technology, the underlying technology behind nearly all Internet security devices that scramble information so even the wiliest hacker is powerless to decode it. As the author of the first widely read textbook on the subject, her opinion carries weight with at least some in the encryption community.
Since encryption can be used to defeat lawful wiretaps and other electronic searches and seizures, Denning backed law enforcement as it tried to fight encryption's spread abroad.
But now a host of objections to the Clinton administration's plan have turned the argument on its head. As the Internet becomes more popular for business use, encryption is more important than ever to keep hackers out. And a recent cryptographer's report suggesting that it would be far riskier to give governments spare keys to decode messages in a few places than not to have third party access at all has clearly shaken Denning's confidence.
Policy specialists in Washington and elsewhere have speculated that Denning would announce something soon, but none wants to push her for fear of alienating someone who could end up a potent ally.
"I don't think any close scientific observer of this debate can deny that there are real technical concerns raised by the Administration's position," said Alan Davidson, counsel with the Center for Democracy and Technology.
"I think its just best for us to sit back and not say anything at this point," added another prominent activist. "We don't want to force her hand."

Something you might find interesting....
By Will Rodger
Washington Bureau Cheif
Inter at ctive Week
The US government will announce later today that will soon lift controls on
technology crucial to doing business over the Internet, White House advisor
Ira Magaziner said yesterday evening.
Under plans expected to be outlined at a noontime press briefing today, the
federal government will require that producers of specialized, narrowly
focused data scrambling products submit only to one-time government
approval before they sell powerful encryption products abroad. Current
policy requires case-by-case approval in most instances.
"Basically it will say that for basic financial and electronic applications
there will be no export restrictions and no requirement for key recovery,"
Magaziner said.
US Undersecretary of Commerce William Reinsch is expected to give details
of the plan. Reinsch could not be reached for comment.
Computer industry executives and public interest groups said the new
arrangement, though far short of deregulating all encryption, was a step in
the right direction.
"This is evidence that the administration acknowledges that manufacturers
of foreign encryption products do exist," said Peter Harter, public policy
counsel at Netscape Communications Corp. "Their policy has put American
industry in the back seat and now we�re trying to catch up."
David Banisar, policy analyst at the Washington-based Electronic Privacy
Information Center, called the move a "small step forward." Nonetheless,
"it still doesn�t reach the needs for secure e-mail or other purposes," he
Computer software and hardware eligible for decontrol under the proposed
regulations must fit several criteria, said Kawika Daguio, a public affairs
specialist with the American Bankers Association who helped hammer out an
agreement for the new regulations. .Though products designed for use by the general public may be unlimited in
the strength of the encryption techniques they employ, they must also be
strictly limited in use, he said. Software written for home banking, for
instance, must be usable only for bank transactions and not easily modified
for general use. Most programs handed out by banks for PC banking at home
fit that criteria, he said. Programs that use the industry  SET standard for credit card purchases over
the Internet should easily meet Commerce Department criteria, too, since
the SET standard encrypts only those data essential to making online
purchases; the limited uses of the standard render it all but useless for
general use. Visa, MasterCard and American Express developed the standard.
"I�d expect programs written with SET to get very rapid approval - within
weeks," Daguio said.
In addition, US companies will have leeway to export any kind of encryption
to any bank as long as that encryption is used only for legitimate,
internal bank functions. Products designed for merchant-to-merchant
transactions without a bank in between would still be subject to stricter
controls, including use of weak software routines that make decoding by law
enforcement easy, or deposit of decoding keys with law enforcement bodies
prior to export.
Commerce Department regulations will spell out details this month or next,
Daguio said. Though more sweeping in nature than past government regulations, the US
banking industry has long enjoyed more freedom to use powerful encryption
technologies abroad than other industries. Successive administrations have
granted banks that leeway since by definition they must have greater
safeguards over employee behavior than all but a handful of industries. In
addition, financial applications have long been easier to design for export
since they typically require encryption of only a few standard data fields.
If sufficiently limited in design, the reasoning goes, they pose no threat
to law enforcement concerned about smugglers or terrorists who may want to
evade detection by law enforcement.
The government and the computer industry have for years been locked in
disputes over the relative importance of encryption technologies and their
potential for misuse.
Since encryption encodes sensitive information like credit card numbers,
voice traffic over public networks and anything else that can be converted
into an electronic stream of ones and zeroes, proponents of electronic
commerce have insisted the technology must be widely deployed to assure the
security of computer networks worldwide. Absent US encryption exports, they
claim, American companies will soon lose their leadership role in a
technology crucial to the country�s competitiveness.
Federal officials, on the other hand, have said export of the technology
threatens global security, since terrorists and criminals in outlaw states
like Libya and North Korea could easily use the technology to defeat
wiretaps and data searches increasingly prized by law enforcement and
national security agencies. In response, they demand that exports of
powerful encryption include so-called key recovery - a method by which law
enforcement can gain access to the encryption keys used to encode messages.
Many public interest groups have condemned the plans, however, saying such
a transfer of power to law enforcement threatens to usher in an era of
ubiquitous and illegal eavesdropping. Several bills pending in Congress
would do away with nearly all controls. Reinsch was expected to testify at
congressional hearings on one of the bills this morning.

@_subject: Clinton Admin. to announce new Crypto regs 
I disagree. Here's why:
New regs unquestionably do change things for US banks. Right now banks may export nothing stronger than unescrowed DES. Period. So - what do they use the dirt-cheap, insecure Internet for? Nothing terribly important outside the US. One banker from JP Morgan told me yesterday that this was big news for them since they would soon move tons of stuff onto the Net. JPM, you'll recall, does business with huge, multinational institutions. They don't do retail banking. They aren't interested in small deals.
What do you suppose JP Morgan's bill for proprietary network use is each year? How much will they save by moving to the Internet?
It's worth noting, too, that banks and consumer software companies will soon export things like PC banking software with minimal delay.
It goes beyond banks. It affects any company that writes financial software for use with the banking infrastructire, including companies like CyberCash and Intuit.
Consider this: Last time Cybercash got approval to export it took them 15 months - count 'em - to get approval. OpenMarket had a similar wait. Regs like those may as well prohibit export. Now DOC says similar deals should be routine and take weeks to complete. Regs are supposed to appear soon - within the month, according to Reinsch's deputy. That's a significant change.

Yes, but  -  Freeh said all products needed to have the _option_ of a key-escrow backdoor built in. The actual deployment of the system should be at the users' discretion. Then again, Sen. Feinstein suggested he needed mandatory key escrow since there was no way to make a voluntary system work. Freeh seemed to warm to the idea of making key escrow mandatory.
"Mandatory key escrow would the best solution - I have to be candid with you on that," he said. Unfortunately, he added, mandatory key escrow isn't a possibility - or foolproof, either.

Marc Rotenberg had a compelling simile to counter Director Freeh's "airbag" statement on mandatory key recovery yesterday. Though some outlets saw the FBI position as a radical departure, this writer saw only more emphasis on themes from previous statements. This is from my story this AM.
- From :
"But Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Center, said the statement wasn't surprising. Indeed, documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act and posted on the group's Web site for the past two years show that various parties within the White House have long favored mandatory controls. 'This is such old news that we had this on our Christmas cards two years ago,' Rotenberg said. 'We've known all along this was their goal. Louis Freeh says mandatory key escrow is like airbags? It's more like painting the windshield black. Happy driving, crypto users.'"
Denning had much to say against immediate imposition of mandatory controls, as well.

At earliest, August of 1998 before anything passes - and even that is highly optimistic.
I predict shouting on the floors of both houses and maybe even a shoving match or two before this is settled. Early evidence of the passions stirred: my story at  the atmosphere in that room was, to put it politely, charged.
Another prediction: if the administration loses, you can count on a huge shake up at the top of the FBI. A defeat on this issue will make Ruby Ridge, Waco and Hoover's days of wiretap abuse and blackmail seem like the good old days. And since the FBI is playing front for what is now clearly White House intent - forget meaningless blather over what is "policy" and "not policy" - it will be the Fibbies who take the hits.

Sure. But let me throw in a simple caveat: politics is about people - _all_ predictions of what they will do are subjective.
With one month to go, there are a handful of things taking up time in Congress. The budget is the by far the largest one. Unless a bill is truly close to passing or the leadership has already evinced a desire to move on a bill - and they haven't - it's unlikely it will pass with so little time left.  Also, there's no bill in the Senate that goes as far as what's moving in the House; even Dorothy Denning says mandatory KR gives here the heebie-jeebies under current technology. Simply put: crypto is an issue of truly enormous import. Congress will figure that out quickly once everyone has heard both sides of the issue.
That's my general estimate of the time needed for a subject that is simply too complex for quick action. Look at telecom reform: it took a decade to do. August recess. Getting something done far in advance of it just seems unlikely, but if it were close, the leadership might want to get rid of the issue before recessing. And don't forget that is an election year. No way do you want to go home and campaign with that issue still hanging fire. For that matter, a lot of people blamed crypto's slow progress on the whole of  '96. If it isn't settled by August, I think you're definitely into 1999. Now, again, there's no scientific proof that Congress couldn't move before then. This is just my own estimate of the importance of this issue.
Declan gets a fifth of whatever he fancies if this thing is settled before August 1998.

Jeez, I'm not trying to be contrary John or Declan, but here's my The chance that more than a few hyper-busy members of Congress actually understand this way-arcane issue is nearing zero. Let's face it; many if not most members don't even use a PC. Based on what I've heard in hearings and from staffers, my seat-of-the-pants guess is - oh - let's say 30 of the 535 members in House and Senate really get The rest are doing the best they can with limited information, most of the time responding to the last person they heard. Thus, 18 0f 22 co-sponsors of SAFE went the other way after hearing from the FBI.
It's not so much that people are _changing_ their minds, it's that they still don't know enough to make an informed decision. Until the last few weeks, crypto never occupied the attention of more than a handful of the dozens of committees on the Hill.
Unlike most issues, crypto _is_ rocket science to these folks - as it is to just about the entire world.

Peter asked me to forward this.
Here he makes a valuable point on political organization - something which helps explain why some people are more dire in their tone regarding the state of things here in Washington.
Below's what he wrote.
At 10:31 PM 9/14/97 -0400, Will Rodger explained his view that:
        In politics, unfortunately, you often have to act *as if* the side is going to win soon.  If you don't, they might.
        A great example was the 1986 Tax Reform Act.  Everyone knew that it
was too complicated for Congress to understand.  Everyone knew that were lots of powerful opponents to its elimination of many tax But the darn thing passed anyways.  Even supporters were shocked.  The story
is told in a very well-written book, "Showdown in Gucci Gulch."
        When considering what Congress will do, remember that there 12,000 bills a year introduced in each chamber.  Crypto is only one of many,
many issues the Members of Congress need to consider.  When things get too
complicated, a politician might think it's just easier to go along with law
enforcement.  How many politicians lose by being tough on crime?
        As for the 1996 Telecomm Act, it's a bad example of what's likely to
happen with crypto.  That Act was fought between truly enormous companies --
RBOCS, AT&T, cable, etc.  Those companies had enormous Washington fighting a life and death lobbying battle for years.  In crypto, the guys have nothing like the same lobbying resources.  Unlike Telecomm, very largest existing companies in the country will not lose billions year if a bad crypto bill is passed.
        In short, it is quite possible that nothing will pass before 1998.  It is quite possible by then that the issue will seem hot, and thus be dropped so close to an election.  But the FBI might win if we don't act *as if* mandatory key escrow is a real         Peter

One of the main assertions made by both sides in the privacy battles is people must be informed when a third party is gathering "personal" information about them.
But what constitutes personally identifiable information, anyway? Where do "real" privacy concerns begin? Below is a story I wrote  about Imgis Inc. - a little-noticed company whose cookies are among the most common on the Net. If you don't them now, look in your cookie file. Chances are you'll find several marked "imgis.com."
Imgis thought it knew what the privacy concerns were with its technology. Others thought otherwise. Within two days of hearing about impending opposition, the company apparently changed its views.

from Ad tracking technology sparks new privacy war
By Will Rodger
September 19, 1997
11:42 AM PDT
 Inter at ctive Week Online
An effort supported by two of the world's largest advertising brokers to tailor advertising to individual Internet users may pose the greatest threat yet to the protection of privacy in cyberspace, activists said.
Under a system due for rollout in the first half of 1998, the Web advertising service Imgis Inc. will begin comparing detailed demographic information about Internet users to its stock of Web-
ready ads, sending Net users only those ads Imgis determines are best matched to their interests. The company, based in Los Angeles, will use a system of "match codes" to identify individual users.
Match codes are unique identifiers used to pick information about consumers out of databases, much as banks use Social Security numbers to identify customers.
Under the plan, when Internet users visit Web sites carrying Imgis ads, participating Internet service operators would send Imgis a match code corresponding to a demographic database of 140 million consumers maintained by database marketer Metromail Corp.
Imgis would then compare users' names, addresses, estimated incomes and automobile ownership against an inventory of advertisements. Thus, a white, single 25-year-old man living in Dubuque, Iowa, could see an ad that differs from that seen by a 65-year-old American Indian woman living in Manhattan.
Yet, at the same time, the system has the ability to track the movements of any Internet user across participating sites, potentially revealing a dizzying array of confidential information, including users' reading habits, health concerns, political inclinations and religious affiliations. Imgis executives insist they won't do so, but the danger remains, critics said.
Shelley Pasnik, an analyst with the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Media Education, slammed the proposal.
"This is huge. This is the most detailed proposal I've seen and probably the most significant threat to privacy I've heard of," she "This is a really big deal; this is a real step back," added Tara Lemmey, chief executive officer of Narrowline Inc., a San Francisco-
based Internet advertising firm and a member of the TRUSTe privacy consortium. "This is a case where it's really important to step back and say we've really crossed the line."
Imgis, which specializes in Internet advertising, will place ads sold by Petry Media Corp. and Katz Media Group Inc.
Exposure of the plan follows four days of hearings on cyberspace privacy at the U.S. Federal Trade Commission last June. Though direct marketers were often on the defensive over their use of surreptitious techniques in gathering consumer information in cyberspace, the FTC tentatively concluded that the industry should police itself before the government takes action to protect privacy on the Internet.
But the Imgis case "accentuates all the concerns we've been talking about," said David Medine, associate director of credit practices at the FTC and moderator of most of the sessions. "Up until today, I think that users naturally assumed that users were anonymous through their Internet service providers when they surfed the Web. I don't think that you can say that anymore. If that has changed, it represents a dramatic shift in the relationship between the user and the Internet."
Medine said the FTC would expect Imgis to disclose all aspects of its data gathering through participating Web sites and ISPs if it begins using match codes to tailor ad delivery.
In an interview Tuesday, Imgis Chief Executive Officer Chuck Berger told Inter at ctive Week that his company had signed two Internet service providers, GTE Corp. and Netcom On-Line Communication Services Inc., to carry the service sometime in the first half of At the time, Berger said he believed there were no privacy concerns with "anonymous match codes," since Imgis had decided not to record which sites users visit.
"Once we pull your ad out of our database, we're done," Berger said. "We're not following you around the Web."
Imgis abruptly altered its story Thursday after Inter at ctive Week found that privacy advocates were up in arms over the technology. Marisa Verson, a principal with San Francisco public relations firm Interactive Communications Inc., which represents Imgis, said Imgis never had agreements with GTE or Netcom.
"GTE is nothing," she said. "If Chuck communicated that, I don't know how he even thinks that. This thing isn't even in the speculative stage until the privacy thing is down."
GTE spokesman Bill Kula confirmed Thursday morning that "we do use Imgis - or plan to - related to using actual public billing files." But "there's not a contract between the two companies today."
Netcom officials said they spoke with Imgis more than a year ago about the match code proposal but had discarded the idea over privacy "I have absolutely zero plans to be involved with this," said Netcom advertising director Terry Pittman. "Whatever we do needs to be in synch with some rules of the road so that people know what we do with their information."
Imgis officials, stung by criticism of their plan, said they are moving swiftly. Though Berger earlier described Netizens who worry about their privacy online as a "vocal minority," Imgis marketing director David Kopp said the company is moving to develop some way of disclosing how it gathers information online and what it does with "We'll come up with a policy that makes sense," Kopp said. "These issues are very big issues. The main reason we haven't pursued the product is we're not entirely confident we have a set of standards that would work. Without informed consent you can't do this sort of Kopp said the company would soon contact TRUSTe for guidance.
TRUSTe Chairman Lori Fena said she hoped to hear from Kopp soon.
"We mandate full disclosure," she said. "We expect full disclosure at all the Web sites, so this would no longer be a back-door deal."
The FTC's Medine agreed.
"It's going to take enough firms getting beat up in the press to make people realize they have to think about this first - before they develop the technology," he said.

Both sides, in this case, is pretty much everyone at the FTC roundtable last June. The one exception I recall is the position taken by the Competitive Enterprise Institute. The CEI took the position that no regulation at all was needed and that marketplace forces would police the Net. Their view, for better or worse, is not very visible elsewhere.
Another solution, of course, is a techno-arms race solution to privacy. That works for readers of this list, but that's not who the FTC worries about. Libertarians will, of course, shudder at the notion that they should.

That's a bold assertion, but not one that squares easily with the half-dozen or so privacy laws already on the books at the federal I would like to go to those small-town folk of whom urban intellectuals write so eloquently and ask them what they would think of their neighbors posting all their gossip to a place where millions can read it. Something tells me they wouldn't see those two actions as one in the same. There is a qualitiative difference between the That's about as far as I'm going on that one.
I'm sure Bernstein, DeFalco et al. will have clear reasons for why none of us should care less.

Actually, I'd be more than happy to "draw the line" if I did such things for a living - but I don't. In any case, I'd address the topic of privacy on its own without referring to hot button issues like obscenity. I invite everyone else to decide if the two issues are a fair parallel or not.

Nope. Though Canada allows export of strong crypto generally, Canadians may not re-export US products once they enter the country.
Yup. As you could imagine, US export laws are set up to try to avoid such compatibility whenever possible. This is also a reason why PGP Inc.'s recent shift to crypto services and away from relying on crypto sales exclusively is a relatively big deal. If everyone has the software, PGP Inc. can provide services to those folks a lot more easily. PGP 5.0, of course, is out there on the Net for the taking Will Rodger
