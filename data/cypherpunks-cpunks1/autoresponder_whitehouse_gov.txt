Thank you for writing to President Clinton via electronic
mail.  Since June, 1993, whitehouse.gov has received over one
million messages from people across the country and around the
world.      Because so many of you write, the President cannot
personally review each message.  The mail is first read by White
House Correspondence staff.  Your concerns, ideas, and
suggestions are carefully recorded and communicated to the
President weekly with a representative sampling of the mail.
     We are excited about the progress of online communication as
a tool to bring government and the people closer together.  Your
continued interest and participation are very important to that
                       Sincerely,
                       Stephen K. Horn
                       Director, Presidential Email
                       The Office of Correspondence
