The Codebreakers by Kahn is available at some stores.  (Powell's Technical
books in Portland, OR has copies.  It is right next to Applied
Cryptography.)  It has not filtered down to some ordering systems, so some
bookstores claim it is out of print.
Warning:  The book is $65.00 hardbound!  (It is also *NOT* a small book.
It is large.  About 2000 pages by my guess.  (Maybe more.  I was being
pulled out of the bookstore at the time.  My wife was trying to save me
from the evil mind control rays of Powell's Tech books.)
I know what is on my shopping list for Christmas.

Or maybe it is a plot to keep an eye on Matt Blaze.  ("Here...  Have this

Now the truly paranoia will not only cover their heads with tinfoil, they

I remember that there was some confusion as to the second edition of _The

did not see a resolution to it.  I may have missed it if it was.)
"I found a copy of _The Puzzle Palace_ 2nd edition!", he said crypticly.
In the Penguin Press printing of _The Puzzle Palace_, it notes that there
is the 1982 edition (published by Houghton Mifflin) and one in 1983
(published by Penguin) with a new afterward.  Since the afterward contains
a fair amount of new information (it looks like a number of FOIA requests
came in after going to press), it is probibly the "Second Edition" of which
Schneier speaks...
Hope that clears things up...

on where he ordered it.  It was in stock, whereever he got it...)

@_subject: Information [for new PGP user] 
Depending on the system, compiler and version of PGP, compilation may or
may not function as expected.
I have had a number of odd problems compiling the code for the PC over the
years.  (It has always compiled easily on the Unix boxes I have used.)  The
"gorrila" version on the Cypherpunks FTP site does not want to compile at
all.  (It wanted specific libraries that were not in the version of the
compiler I was using.)  Microsoft's compiler had a few odd problems as well
with some of the earlier versions.  (I think I was compiling PGP 2.6 with
VC++ 7.0.)
Also, you have to have the compiler in the first place.  The latest
compilers are getting pretty big.  (100+ megs!)  Most people either do not
have the disk space, the money for them (or do not know where to get free
ones), or the needed arcane knowledge to get the compile to happen at all.
(And if there was a subtile bug in the code, most people would not be able
to find it.  This includes many programmers.)
BTW, there is a Windows95 console version of the International version.
(Check out  for versions
available.)  It is the "non-us approved" version, so use at your own risk.
My problem with PGP is that there is no protection for information on what
keys are on your secret keyring.  It would be quite possible to create a
program that read the keyring and saved off the names of all nyms and
truenames it found there.  (It would make it quite easy to then find out
that "Nym X" is associated with "User Y".)  And with Active X, it could be
offloaded to a remote site without anyone being the wiser...

Clinton and Gore have both shown that they get arroused at the thought of

I don't expect them to do anything that would thwart that fetish. (Power is

2) The huge pile of technical manuals/books that I need to read.  (I have
been measuring them, not in number of books, but in linear feet.)
3) Many of the bookstores locally (especially the chains) have a HUGE
percentage of their books being "franchise SF".  It is hard to find
something good when you have to wade through the Star Trek, Star Wars,
Doom, Myst, Story set in the world of  by written by
, and assorted Pern-ography.  (The last chain bookstore I went to
had *NOTHING* that I had not read or was willing to read.)  I guess that is
what i get for going to malls...
ObCrypto:  It is ironic that the 2nd edition of The Codebreakers is out.  I
had just done a book search on it and was going to get a local bookstore to
order me a copy.  (The prices on the used market ran anywhere from $20 to
$80!  That is copied that actually sold, not just asking price.)
I guess I will have to do a book search on _The Puzzle Palace_ and maybe it
will get released. (In kind of a strange quantum bookbuying action at a

Philip Jose Farmer claimed to have written that one.
It also brings up an interesting point...
Nyms are fairly commonplace amongst the writing community.  (Even Steven
King wrote under a nym (or two).)  In fact there are books listing "nyms of
the famous" for book collectors.  Payment schemes for authors under nyms
are already in place.  (For example, I do a monthly column under a nym and
they have no qualms about paying me.)  DBAs also cover nyms in some respects.
Nyms do not have to have a "sinister purpose" (as the feds would like us to
believe).  I think that they are far more ingraned into the culture than
people realize.  (Where would this world be without Mark Twain (a nym for
Samuel Clemmens), Maxwell Grant (the nym for Walter B. Gibson and others
for the Shadow pulps), and the thousands of other nyms that appear in the
publishing field?)  Just because they are published under a nym does not
mean anyone takes their books less seriously or enjoy them less.  (In fact,
there are many authors that are nyms unbeknownst to the readers.  I would
say that most nyms in the publishing world are...)

If I were going to attack such a system, I would just start to have the
eternity servers store my core files or some other junk.  (Or maybe feed
it the SIMTEL or funet.fi archives.) Enough crap so that you could not
have enough space to store the real important stuff...
And then, if anyone did delete it out of the Eternity server(s), I would
yell "censorship" to the freedom knights and/or their fellow travelers...

This sounds absurd but similar things have happened.
The translation team for the Dead Sea Scrolls tried to keep the actual
texts secret so they would be the only ones with the "Official"
translation.  They did, however, publish tables of what words were used
and their location for use by researchers.  A couple of them got the idea
to use the lookup table to reconstruct the text.  The results were a copy
of the original text.  (Needless to say, the "official" translation team
was quite upset.)  It did finally result in the publication of the
scrolls, since the information had been "leaked".

@_subject: Cypherpunk Elitism and Spam Filters 
I have been watching the debate on Cypherpunk Extremism, filtering spam,
and the like and have a few comments.
When Tim May claims that Cypherpunk solutions lead to elitism, he is more
correct than Vullis or any of his ilk are willing to realize.  The reasons
for this are out of implementation, not out of any ill-will or evil intent.
 It is because it requires special knowledge and/or software to be able to
implement the "solution(s)".  (Note that I am only aware of his comments
through quotes of his material.  I have blocked him at the procmail level,
so I cannot go back through trash and read the originals.  Probably a good
thing, as it keeps me from sinking to the level of flames and personal
attacks.  Attention Vullis revels in...)
I have watched the conversations on filtering and have seen few, if any,
methods that would be usable by a poster of average experience without alot
of extra frustration and/or time involved.  For a filtering or posting
method to be useful (or used), it has to be uncumbersome to use, no matter
the platform.
Charging for posting is not (in my opinion) a good method because
conversions from real cash to e-cash are not very easy and/or available at
this time.  It would leave the posting to the "elite" who have connections
to e-cash acceptable to the list management.
Tokens are nice, but most plans for them make it a pain to post with any
sort of e-mail software.  (Cut and pasting a token will work for one or two
sites, but if a user posts to many lists, keeping track of all those tokens
could become quite a pain.  There is also the risk of people posting their
tokens for general use or the token being used to track anonymous posters.
PGP signatures are a solution, but not a very adequate one at this point.
Most  autosign software has one or two minor problems.  The first is that
they do not line wrap before signing the text.  This causes the sig to
break.  The second thing that people get bitten by is that some signing
software only takes the "default" key.  This means that, without special
effort, they are stuck with one key to use for signing.  (Which makes anon
postings a bit of a pain.)
The reason anon.penet.fi became as popular as it did is because it was
easier to use than the alternatives.
A solution that is difficult to use will be left to an "elite" to use.  (If
used at all.)
A good example of this is the PGP aware version of Majordomo.  The traffic
on one list using that software is little to none.  I believe that this is
because the "ante" to post is too high.  (It also has strange desires for
specific linefeed formats, as well as other things that make posting a chore.)
The "solution" to this is to design tools that make use of these things
usable, not only for the "elite", but for the rest of the user community.
(Or at least the upper 70-90%.  There has to be some level of knowledge for
entry into the game.  The difficulty is knowing where to set that "bar".)
Netscape is a good example of "transparent" crypto.  It has problems
though.  How many sites do you connect to that use SSL?  Damn few I will
bet.  How many encrypt everything, not just the "important stuff".  Next to
none.  Why?  Getting a secure server costs a fair chunk of change.  It is
possible to get one for "non-commercial use", but it is still going to cost
you a bit for the certificate needed to run the server. ($295 bucks and the
list of hoop to jump through.  Verisign usually wants you to be a corporate
entity.)  Any chance of a CPunk CA coming into existence any time soon?
A better chance for "transparent" security is with the IPSec FreeSwan
project.  How many of you out there are willing to put in the effort to get
it to work though?  It does have a pretty high cost in knowledge and
effort.  (It also seems to have some places that need work. Non-Unix
clients and sites feeding off of dynamic IPs are going to be a future
hurdle.)  It does have probability of making things a whole lot more
difficult for the busybodies at the various TLAs.  (The NSA krill nets will

"elitist" solution.  There is no escaping that.  (And since there are
people who would rather concentrate on personal feuds instead of technical
hurdles, it will probably remain one for alot longer.)
I would like to see alot less of the "elitist" solutions.  My reasons are
very plain.  Elitist solutions take far too much of my time to use.  They
do not have to be that way.
There are Cypherpunks doing work to make these tools more usable.  Most of
them are doing it in the background and not looking for the "glory".
Because of the self-centered ranting of a few, most of those who were the
strongest supporters of "Cypherpunk goals" no longer associate with the
list.  The ones who have my highest respect are those that have actually
done something to accomplish those goals, instead of writing
(semi-)anonymous flames and personal attacks against Tim May and/or John
Gilmore.  (I sometime what Vullis has done to promote privacy and security
for individuals.  His pissing in the list pool certainly has done nothing
positive that I have seen.)
[Note that I do not always agree with Tim May.  There have been many time I
have read his posts and wondered if he was indulging in chemical
recreation.  (And he has probably wondered the same about some of my posts.
 probably about this one...) Sometimes he is dead on and well worth
reading.  But his posts are at least thought out and lack the most of the
vitriol that some others on this list have been spitting.  Part of the
problem with reputation schemes is that humans are not always consistent.
Sometimes they do not fit into the "yes" or "no" boxes we try and stuff
them into.]
Those who are working towards "elitist" solutions are at least working
towards solutions.  I think people need to ask themselves what goals they
desire for themselves and what it will take to get there.  You don't need
to write code necessarily, but you do need to do something other than just
bitch and moan.
What have you done to support privacy today?

Or beter excuses.
Even an exacto-knife would work.  For proportional fonts it depends on how
nasty the kerning gets and the shape of the characters.  (And a san serif
font without too many kerning pairs should go though fine.)  The technology
for this has progressed quite a bit in the last few years.  Next thing you know, OCR software will be export controlled as well.  (Or
they will require something silly, like having all code samples in
caligraphy fonts.)
And even if it didn't, just selecting and deleting the margin areas would
not be all that difficult.  (Ooohhh...  A couple of extra hours is really
going to slow someone down.)
I used to work for a company that would transfer entire archives of medical
journals.  Much of it we would just OCR.  Some of it we would send off
shore.  The OCR software was about 95% reliable and this was over 5 years
ago.  (And we were using 286 boxes for much of the OCR work.  Not a heavy
technoligical investment.)  I am sure that things have improved a great
deal since then.  (My new scanner included OCR software.  I will have to
run a test and report the findings.

cannot handle effectivly.
1) The Spam that has been flooding the list.  It looks like someone has an
axe to grind against the list or certain people on it, so they are doing
their best to disrupt it.  The spam is only part of that attack.  It should
be dealt with as any other denial of service attack.
2) The anonymous flames against Tim May (or anyone else for that
matter...).  These messages contain no useful content.  They only serve to
allow certain overgrown juviniles to vent against people they dislike.
Killing the above would greatly improve the quality of the list. The rest
can be killed by filters.
As for the people who are crying "censor", I have seen little evidence that
the doom they predict is going to happen.  (I think that they revel in the
idea that they are the "persecuted masses" who are being hassled by "the
man".)  I have been on this list for a number of years.  (Since at least
1994, maybe earlier than that...) Sandy has been one of the more rational
voice on the list in that time and he has been here longer than I have.  (I
have not always agreed with him, but then again, I can think of no one that
I would agree with 100%.  Even myself...)  Hopefully the criteria used for
moderation will not be so heavy handed that the list becomes bland and
tasteless (like a high school textbook from Texas).

Online credit-card scare an inside job,
          Starwave says           Two separate but chilling messages were sent to people who
          purchased items online from ESPNet or the NBA Store this
          week. The first anonymous E-mail told shoppers they had
          been the victims of careless security and that their
          credit-card numbers and addresses were easily available.
          The second message, sent by E-mail and regular mail by the
          World Wide Web sites' host, Starwave Corp., alerted 2,397
          online shoppers that their credit-card information might have
          been misappropriated.
          Starwave said the credit-card information was in a secure,
          encrypted area that was accessed by an intruder who had
          the proper password information. "This was not done by a
          hacker," said Jennifer Yazzolino, a Starwave spokeswoman.
          "They knew how to get in to the system and unlawfully used
          classified information." The area that the intruder broke in to
          was an order-processing system that sends shoppers'
          orders from each site to 1-800-PRO-TEAM, a Florida
          fulfillment company.
          Following the break-in, Starwave called in the FBI and the U.S.
          Secret Service to investigate. It has also implemented a new
          encryption process and changed all system passwords. "We
          think this is a matter of a password either being used
          directly by someone involved with the system or passed along
          directly by someone involved in the system," Yazzolino said.           "We relied too much on human integrity."

They will determine some standard, not based on any actual 10-year olds or
any knowledge of what is good for them.  It will be based on input from
various preasure groups as to what a "good little 10-year old" should be
like.  And what is "good for a 10-year old is good for America".
The real reason for these controls is to impose their "moral" views on the

sheltering attitudes by the adults claiming the moral high ground that we
have so many people with confused attitudes about sex and sexuallity.
This is where the real harm comes in.  Ignorance helps no one.  (Except
the moralists pointing fingers and screaming "I told you so!".
The idea that children are somehow scarred and harmed by sexually explicit
material is without any foundation or evidence.  (Assuming they are able
to get real unfiltered information to make a correct descision and are not
getting guilt tripped for wanting that information.)
Note, I am not talking about sexual contact or any of the other boogie
men that the moralists and control freaks try to bring up.  Adolecence is
supposed to be a time to prepare for adulthood.  They are going to form
some sort of opinion one way or another.  If they get no information or
support before they are 18/21, they are going to wind up pretty screwed

                      McCain Talks Crypto
           by Todd Lappin            6:04pm  20.Jun.97.PDT Just got off the phone with Senator
           John McCain.            It has been a big week for the Republican from
           Arizona. On Monday, he and Senator Bob Kerrey
           (D-Nebraska) dropped a bomb on the encryption
           debate. They introduced S909, the Secure Public
           Networks Act, a bill that would write into law most of
           the Clinton administration's encryption policy -
           leviathan key recovery system, continued restraints
           on exporting strong encryption, the whole bit. Then,
           leveraging his chairmanship of the Senate
           Commerce Committee, he pushed the bill onto a
           legislative fast track. Despite the fact that his bill cuts
           the legs from under Pro-CODE - a bill by Montana
           Republican Conrad Burns that would scrap the
           export controls - McCain said he's eager to negotiate
           on the issues.            Here are the highlights of our 5-minute conversation
           - during which a certain two-word term was repeated
           again and again. Let's see if you can spot it.            On the rationale behind S909:
           "I've always said that national security is a primary
           concern - and based on my own experience [nearly
           six years as a Vietnam POW], I've had a lot of time to
           consider how important that really is."            On the software industry:
           "Frankly, I'm somewhat surprised that the software
           industry would be so willing to downplay the dangers
           of child porn.... This stuff is out there, and we can't
           allow child pornographers to hide by encrypting that
           material."            "... I'm astonished that any industry would consider
           their priorities to be so important that they override
           national security concerns."            On the rival Pro-CODE bill:
           "I'm all for Pro-CODE - except for its impact on
           national security.            On the future:
           "I promise you, now that we've adopted this
           legislation, we will sit down and work this out with all
           the parties involved. As I've said before, from a
           practical standpoint, we can't override a presidential
           veto. With this bill, we've established that the
           president of the United States has authority over
           national security."

Vulis uses insults and personal attacks to cause emotional pain to his

made all sorts of unsavory claims about Bruce that he *KNEW* were unture.  He
did it because he knew that he could hurt Bruce by doing so.  (I know Bruce
very well.  Vulis was lying and it was vindictive.  None of what he said

people like Toto seem to cut him so much slack.

The current line of argument in supporting crypto seems to fall into the
"software as speech" (ala First Amendment) or Crypto as munition (and
invoking the Second Amendment).  I think of Crypto as "Freedom of Language".  Imagine the uproar that would be caused if Jesse Helms (or one of his ilk)
tried to pass a law that all conversations over the net or phone lines had to
be in English.  (Or at least in a language understood by the cops.)  The
amount of uproar would be incredible.  The courts have already ruled against
this form of "language escrow".  Such rulings should apply to encrypted
communications as well.
Software is just the mechanism for the language of cryptography, it is not
the language itself.  Just as in spoken languages, special knowledge is
needed to understand the "ideas" being communicated.  The algorithm is (in
part) that language.  (But in this case, you are able to speak to only those
you intend, not to the world at large.)
Of course, the question is whether this line of reasoning will work under the
current regime.  Maybe, maybe not.  It seems a better argument than the ones
I have seen so far...  Depends on how far the deck has been stacked against

IRS agents arrest Vancouver man who called for killing federal workers
* James D. Bell, who wrote the 10-part essay, "Assassination Politics," faces charges of interfering with a U.S. officer
By John Painter Jr.
of the Oregonian staff
VANCOUVER - A Vancouver man who has written about assassination of government officials and whose home was raided in April has been arrested by IRS agents on charges of interfering with a federal officer.
James D. Bell was held without bail in the Clark County jail.  On Monday, the IRS will transport him to U.S. District Court in Tacoma for his first appearance.  He was arrested without incident Friday evening while waiting
for a bus after work.
IRS agents could not be reached for comment, and the complaint underlying the criminal charge was sealed and unavailable.  The Clark County Jail confirmed that Bell was a prisoner there, held on a federal detainer.
A friend of Bell's, Robert W. East, said Bell phoned him from jail and told him he was arrested for interfering with a federal officer.
The affidavit for the April search warrant accused Bell of "directly soliciting others to set up a system to murder government officials" and "obtaining the home address of an IRS employee, as well as information about bombs and bomb-making materials."
Bell is the admitted author of a 10-part essay called "Assassination Politics," which has been circulated widely on the Internet, particularly in anti-government forums.  "Assassination Politics" discusses creation of an organization to reward those killing public officials while protecting assassins' identities.
IRS agents searched East's home in Vancouver on Thursday.  East said he was questioned for about 90 minutes, during which time agents asked him about a "stink-bomb attack" on an IRS office in San Diego or Long Beach, Calif.,
and a "propane bomb" found at another IRS office.  In that search agents found a 3-
foot carbon fiber that East said he got from Bell for an electrolysis Federal agents since have focused on a Bell theory that carbon fibers could
be used to sabotage computer hard drives, thus disabling them.  East confirmed Bell's interest in using carbon fibers as a "computer killer" but dismissed
it as a "goofball idea."
The search warrant for East's home shows that the government also is interested in determining whether Bell and others have experimented with volatile chemicals in preparation for attacks on IRS offices and agents.
The search warrant for Bell's home shows that agents were searching for evidence of "threats, assaults, obstruction, intimidation, solicitation of murder, false statements, and the unlawful use of false social security Jeff Gordon, a Portland-based IRS special investigator, said he discovered "Assassination Politics" among items seized when IRS agents took Bell's 1986 Honda for unpaid back taxes in February.  Bell denied the car was his.  An
IRS tally of the items inside the car included a document about a "trial" by the Multnomah County Common Law Court in January of several IRS agents, a federal magistrate in Portland, U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno and an IRS commissioner, Margaret Richardson.

Actually I was quoting from the Oregonian, the local fishwrap.
Some of his statements could have been taken as advocating the killing of federal employees of various sorts.  The question is whether he actually
tried to arrange it in real life.  (Which I doubt.)
I found that part quite interesting.  I remember Jim going off about this (without refering to any specific method) at the first Portland Cypherpunk meeting.  He got pretty pissed when I mentioned it on the list.  (As well as my post that I thought he was a loon.)  Interesting to see that there is an actual method mentioned.  (And that his friend also thought it was kind of Neither can I.  Maybe it was supposed to short out the electronics.  Imagine what that would do to your lungs!  Youch!
It is interesting that they have kept the warrent sealed.  This, more than anything makes me question the legitamacy of the whole affair.  Sounds like the IRS is planning a preemptive strike on the Common Law Courts and the people behind them.
That is not explained.  I think it was an excuse to arrest him without having to reveal the real reasons.  Be interesting to see what they accuse him of The IRS seems to have overstepped a little in this case...  The sealed warrents are an attempt to keep it from being examined in more detail.

Depends on who is trying the case.  Judging where the article in the paper
was at, and the lack of other media coverage, I expect them to make a quiet example of him.  (i.e. punish him in a way that the people interested in the case feel threatened but does not give the rest of the sheep any ideas.)
I don't think so.  I am amazed they have not mentioned the guns that were seized.  I am willing to be this is the first salvo in a very quiet and very dirty little war.
Maybe we should start an anonymous betting pool as to which one of us will be the next to be arrested.

I was very tempted to set up a demo AP server just to see what kind of
targets people would select.  (I do not believe that most people would select government employees.)  The slogan "Who do you want to kill today" has such a nice ring to it...  In order for such a system (or anarchy in general) to work, the general public has to be more aware of the type of state they live in.  With all of the "Bread and Circuses" that people are being subjected to, little wonder they are going along with the show.  (There are also a number
of psychological studies that show that people will do all sorts of horrific things to their fellow man when someone in authority tells them to.  If they are led to believe that they are "bad" in some way, many will enjoy it.)

The news story was a pretty interesting hatchet job.  Included a number of horsemen and prominently mentioned encryption.  They claimed that the reason for the raid on East's home was because he sent Bell encrypted messages containing various evil and unauthorized thoughts.
Why am I not surprised...

@_subject: Why I think Jim Bell is getting railroaded 
I think that the Government is trying to make an example of Mr. Bell.  I
think that much of the charges reported in the news are flase.
Here is why...
1) They claim that Jim was actively trying to disrupt 911 service and poison the Bull Run water supply.  These are non-political targets.  Jim only thinks in political targets.  (I remember trying to get him to come to grips with
the idea that such a system as AP would not be used just for government types.  That is would be used against anyone who had enemies.  Could not even make a 2) The warrent is sealed, yet the media is reporting all sorts of things
about the case.  Where is the information coming from?  Sounds like planted information to keep people from complaining too much when they send him up
the river for a few years...  (Whether he survives long in custody is another story.  I would be willing to bet that if he does not "cooperate" that he
will have some sort of "accident" while in government hands.)
3) The suspected crimes list keeps changing.  How many times has the "official" story changed?  Each time it gets more and more lurid.  (And many of the crimes are ones that get used against damn near every case the government tries against someone who threatens the security of the state.  Belief starts to wear a bit thin after a while...)
Of course, i do not expect anything like the truth from standing in the way
of a conviction...

Sounds like the AUTH_COOKIE module at work again.  Pretty easy to fix.  Just comment out the AUTH_COOKIE module (which should not be turned on anyways) in the src/Configuration file and recompile.  Keeps people from being cookie-

AUTH_COOKIE is actually something for excessive user tracking.  It sends a cookie for every object sent by the server.  If they have Netscape 3.0 and
are tracking such things, it becomes a real pain.  Since few webmasters, if any, have log crunchers that will even use that data (or that anyone cares...) it is a waste of log space in the first place.  It also annoys many users.

This story is from the Oregonian May 22, 1997 Page D3:
Arrest solves mystery of law office stink bomb
A federal investigation that led to the arrest of James Dalton Bell of Vancouver appears to have solved a longtime mystery regarding a stink bomb attack in a downtown Portland law office.
In late April 1984, someone broke into law offices at 1123 S. W. Yamhill St. and poured a liquid on a hallway run that was so odorous it made at least one of the lawyers who smelled it vomit At the time, Nick Albrecht, who still practices law there, said the
skunklike scent, called mercaptan, was so overpowering that he had to go home because he could not stop gagging.
The target of the stink bomb attack was lawyer C. Douglas Oliver, who now lives in Southern California and won't discuss the incident.
Bell was arrested Friday on a federal complaint charging him with obstructing and impeding the Internal Revenue Service and the use of false Social Security numbers.  The complaint said that documents found on Bell's computer boasted of the mercaptan attack on the office
of a Portland lawyer who had sued him.
The lawyer was Oliver. Albrecht said Oliver had suspected that Bell
might have been behind the mercaptan attack, but could never prove it.
The federal complaint also charged Bell with the March 16 mercaptan attack on the IRS offices in the federal office building in Vancouver.
On the following day, when employees returned to work after the weekend, several of them had to be placed on leave because the smell was so powerful, the complaint said.

This is one of the few stories out of the whole mess that I do believe.
I was told about the above incident over a year ago by a friend who has known Jim for many years.
It is my understanding that Jim did not encrypt his hard drive at all.  (Jim was not all that experienced as a computer user.  (By his own admission.  At least what he said the time I met him.))
If the feds has stuck to the stink bomb story, it would have been alot more plausable.  But the "poisoning the bullrun" and "911" stuff is a bit far fetched for Jim.  It does not fit the way he thinks.
Easier said than done...

But it is what you *SHOULD* do.  If you have evidence, then present it.  If
not, then you are just blowing smoke and FUD.
C2Net should have demanded proof instead of getting defensive.  That
worries me, not because of "hidden backdoors", but because it shows lack of
confidence in their own products. But lack of confidence has nothing to do
with actual strength of the product.
Well, I am *NOT* an employee of C2Net.

If you have evidence, then show it.
This "stronghold is weak" rant sounds much like the Creationists on
talk.origins.  They make pronouncements and then expect others to disprove
them.  The real world does not work like that. (I guess they do not teach
the scientific method at any school you have ever attended. Or maybe you
just skipped class...)
I personally think the reason you do not show it is because you do not HAVE
any evidence.  You have lied about people to justify your petty little hatreds before.
(Accusing people you do not know of child mollestation is an old favorite
of yours.)  This one seems to fall into that category as well.
If you do have evidence and refuse to post it, then you are just helping

I guess the real question is whether the messages/files generated just add
an extra key or if they leak the key through some harder to identify method.
The current version of PGP no longer shows you the list of recipients, so
it is more difficult to determine if extra keys are added.
Is the method they are using for this new version to "escrow" the keys
obvious to the recipient or not?

That is bullshit!
So far, there have been claims to a backdoor but no actual proof.
Everytime someone asks for said proof, there is a huge amount of handwaving
and misdirection as to why any sort of proof cannot be revealed.  Each time
the excuses get more and more elaborate.  "C2Net will sue us." "We can make
more money if we keep it secret." "It is already well known."
But the excuses get pretty thin after a while without any real proof.
Yes, employees of C2Net have acted in a stupid manner.  But, in my opinion,
you are using that as a smokescreen to avoid having to reveal anything
substantial.  (Because you do not have anything substantial.)
You can point fingers, accuse people of all sorts of things, and make all
the wheeping wailing and knashing of teeth you want.  It still somes down
to the fact that you have shown no hard evidence that such a backdoor exists.
Put up or shut up.

I wonder how many of them know if their mail can be read now?  Any admin
could just use `less /var/spool/mail/andyg` to read the unencrypted mail
queue. There will always be an out for management.  Managers will not like the
idea of someone being able to read their mail, thus, they will make rules
that they do not have to follow.  (People who think that such rules will be
equally enforced have never worked for a big company.) But the higher up the corporate ladder, the bigger risk that they will have
more info to sell out to the competition.  This sort of policy is only to tighten management's grip on the proles, not
solve any real problem within the corporation.  (Kind of like drug testing,
but without all that messy urine.)
But those who will make the rules will not think through those issues.
Those decisions will be made for totally alien reasons.  Control will be a
big one.  Because it is there will be another.  The corporate GAKware
features of 5.5 will be a big thing with the management types who think it
is a good thing to measure workers keystrokes and monitor their precious
bodily fluids.

I believe that many of them are people who feed off of the
endorphin/adreniline rush of being "outraged".  They need something to get

Depends if the camera is watched.  Vaseline on the lens will blur the image, but you have to get close enough
to get it there.
Hard radiation will blur the film, but tends to have nasty side effects.
Pain guns can cover the lens.
Spray paint cans on long poles (as used by agitprop graffiti artists) are
useful.  (Under the cover of night...)
Laser pointers hidden nearby and aimed at the lens.  (About $20 at your
local discount office store.)
Gas or kerosine poured on the camera will make a nice tiki tourch.
An air rifle or pellet gun may be quiet enough to hit the camera from a
distance, breaking the internals of the camera.  (A crossbow will work as
well, but those may be best saved for those unmarked helicopters planting
pot seeds on your property so the government can seize it later.)
A magnet placed on the side of video cameras may screw up the picture.
(This will only work for the metal cased cameras.  You also have to use a
strong magnet and get it in the right spot.)
I am sure others will have useful suggestions.

I expect tools like this to become more and more prevelent.  Especially

seems to be a desire to find the one magic bullet that will end crime as

every bedroom, or whatever.
It is just as bad as management that tries to find the "one true

ways, that is exactly the same process here.  People in charge looking for
an easy way out...)

Of course, the investigation will only be as good as the data thrown into
it.  And if you misspoke or said something that was not 100% accurate,
that will be used against you later, when they need to wrap up the case.

@_subject: The problem of playing politics with our constitutional rights 
The code also has to do some good.  Currently there are some gaping holes
that I have not seen anyone cover very well.  (At least not in a way that
most users could actually use.)
Take, for example, the average home user.  They will most likely be running
Windows 95 or Windows 3.1 on a PC (486 or pentagram processor).  They
connect to the net via TCP/IP over a dialup link.
Now since Louie "tap'em all, let the FBI sort em out" Freeh may or may not
have that 1% of the phone switch tapped, the part that travels over the
phone is vulnerable.  (Microsoft was working on an SSL enabled winsock.dll,
but it has been dropped.  (Any ideas why? *wink* *wink* *nudge* *nudge*
*say no more*))
Even if the person uses PGP for all their mail, the sites they surf, the
ftp sites they visit, and all the addresses they send mail to will still be
visible to the prying eyes of anyone who has the resources to tap the phone
This is something that needs to be covered.  How about an ssl enabled PPP
daemon, as well as the winsock layer to support it? Then you have to get
ISPs to use it. IPSec does not (as far as I can tell) resolve this problem, not does it
look like an option for the home user.  (From what I have seen (and I may
be wrong), the key distribution is tied to IP address.  What about dynamic
IP addresses?)  Are there any of the IP encryption key exchange protocols
that deal with dynamic IP?  (And/or have a windows based client?)
SSH is a possible option, but it requires a fair bit of knowledge and
another site to connect to that has not been compromised and where you have
a shell account.  (Most ISPs do not support SSH.  Some do not give you a
shell account.) There is also the possibility of apps not talking through
the IP tunnel and revealing unintended information.
Mail is another hole.  Eudora now distributes PGP 5.0 with the latest
version.  (This version does not do RSA keys. You can get the plug in to do
those keys from PGP inc.)  This is helpful, but there are many other
plug-ins that need to be written.  Support for remailers is lacking.
Windows based code for Mixmaster is also a needed thing.  A good interface
would help immensely.  (Private Idaho was a big step in the right
direction. Integrated with a remailer people already use would be another
big step forward.)
I am sure that people can think of all sorts of other ideas for needed
apps.  But to make them usable for the "general public", the apps will be
needed to be written for Windows.  (As much as I hate to think about it...)

Is this not what they claimed when they sold NT to the Air Force?  Judging
by some of the Air Force software I have seen, this frightens me more than
most things.
You have a little more control over plug-ins.
But those are specific to the client.  Most Unix users know better.
I know of one, but I cannot release details yet.  (I did not discover it
and i need to wait until the non-beta version of the product is released.)
Besides, I have been told I will be killed if I reveal it before it is time.
A great deal of this blame can be placed on the WinSock spec.  The spec was
quite "loose" in many details of the implementation.  You could be
complient and still not be able to deal with much of the software out
there.  My vote for bad PC stack of the century was the one put out by Sun.
 Not even close to compatible...
Sturgeon's law applies to people as well...
Most everything involving computers tends to do that.
You can type it out in clear, short sentences and the media will still
screw it up.  If you have no clue as to what you are writing about, the
accuracy of what you write will suffer.
Multi-user NT is available now.  Citrix and NCD both have versions out now.
 (Both are based on NT 3.51.  They would have released a 4.0 product long
ago, but Microsoft wanted the product for themselves.)  The server load
seems to be about 50 users per box.   Depends on what you are running.
Assuming that they can be educated.  Better to offer them a choice.  It is
hard to say "X is bad" unless you have an alternative.
