@_subject: MAIL (SPAM) FILTERING ON CYPHERPUNKS 
Anyone got any information good ways to set up filters for this list, setting up a filter on the from address is giving me a huge list of addresses to block and I am constantly having to add addresses to it. There has to be a more effiecent way of doing it. This is the only list I am subscribed to that i get spammed on.
Any ideas
