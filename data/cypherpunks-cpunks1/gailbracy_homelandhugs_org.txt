@_subject: [IP] Police use cameras to track vehicles of suspects 
For what it's worth, I just finished a cross-country drive from San
Diego to
NC via I-40 and was quite curious about the other fixtures attached
to the
cell towers planted on nearly every mile of the Interstate.
Creepier still, was the fact that I saw virtually no Highway Patrols
any of the states I crossed with the exceptions of Tennessee, and at
a few
construction sites.
