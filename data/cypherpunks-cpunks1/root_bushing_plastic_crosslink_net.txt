Let's see... What about this scenario:
Alice gets a contraband copy of PGP 4.0 off the Internet.  Since the
public-key algorithm is publicized so that people can encrypt software
to a chip, PGP 4.0 has the ability to encode/decode/generate keys for
the chip.  Alice generates a public key/private key pair 0x12345678,
in software.  Alice goes to  and orders Office '99
online, and tells Microsoft "Hi, my name is Alice, my credit card
number is 31426436136778 and my PGPentium's public key is 0x12345678."
Microsoft unwittingly sends Alice a copy encrypted to 0x12345678, for
which she has the private key to.  Alice decrypts Office '99, and
reencrypts it with public key of her PGPentium, as well as the keys f
all her friends.
Does the authentication defeat this?  Our computers would only run
software from Microsoft?  Scary.

The manufacturer is going to publish a list of ALL of the public keys?
We're talking one key per chip, right?  Isn't that an AWFUL lot of
keys, like, in the millions range?
Also... with a few million possible keys like this, all you need to do
is to either guess or factor just one of them.
I'm not sure the "approved" bit would go over too well... one idea
would be to license the compiler writers, who would build the
encryption into compilers.  It's still not horribly great, but
Right; the only reason I could see people using this would be for
economical reasons.
Right; once the user loses control of what he's running, then you can
pretty much do anything you want as far as metering goes.
ObGAK question:  Would this be exportable?  I mean, you could be
encrypting god knows WHAT into those .exe's...  Key escrow?  How would
they get the key?!?  I can see the headlines, "Key Escrow Database
Leaked to Pirate Firm"... :)

It's not.  This was hashed over in alt.folklore.computers a little
while back, and someone did some research and found out that there
haven't been any coup attempts in the past few years in Trinidad, or
something like that.

It's kind of funny to me to see Jefferson being discussed like this,
speaking as a student of it. :)
Actually, it's not all that big a school, thanks to the magic of
controlled admissions, with 1600 students for 4 grades.  This may be a
larger number than many private schools, but it is half the size of
many of the other public schools.  Jefferson probably has one of the
highest percentages in the country, if only because you have to pass a
rigorous standardized test just to get accepted to it.

@_subject: DES challenge status? 
What exactly is the status of RSA's DES contest?  I understand that at
least two of the smaller contests have already been cracked, but I
haven't seen much beyond theoretical discussion on the list on the
topic of the DES contest.
What work has been started on this contest?  I am aware of Peter
Trei's excellent deskr software for win32, but at the moment it chokes
on RSA's real contest data as distributed.  Has anybody yet worked on
porting a version to x86 Linux, with nice, fast, inline assembly?
How about a keyrange-server?  This contest is so huge that any procedural
innovations will probably be much more helpful than getting an early
start.  Has anybody started work on this yet, or is everyone else
waiting for someone else to do it?

You want to download the "personal proxy", perproxy.  It should be available on the same ftp site as the client.  The proxy will buffer the keys and the answers for you... you just run the proxy on your machine, point it at rc5proxy.distributed.net, and you point your client at localhost.
