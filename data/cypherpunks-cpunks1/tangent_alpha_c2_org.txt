@_subject: Encrytions over multiple platforms 
Does anyone know of a hard-drive/partition encrytion program that has been ported to both DOS and Linux/UNIX based systems? I am searching for a system that, obviously, allows both reading and writing of secure/encrytped data.
You help will be greatly appreciated.

@_subject: Encryption over multiple platforms 
Does anyone know of a hard-drive encryption program that has been ported to both DOS and Linux/UNIX based systems? I'm looking into installing some flavor of UNIX on my system, but still wish to retain my DOS based setup. Windows support would be a bonus, though not necessary.
Your help will be greatly appreciated.
