dave, someone called me with a request last week for people who have a good background in internet security, "firewalls" and encryption etc.  I thought Jim Bennett and perhaps some of your other contacts would work.
Could you e-mail Jim's phone and e-mail to
Sandra Huie (Jonathon's wife) at shuie at masterteam.com
Thanks, JP
