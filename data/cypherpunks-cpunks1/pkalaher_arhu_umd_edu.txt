@_subject: Question for article 
Hello;  I read your postings in alt.wired with much interest.
I am working on an article in the 'electronic frontier' vein, kind of like
a cyber-gunslinger piece, and I'd love to have your input...
Say someone fucks you over (real or imagined) or flames you severely.  What
sort of nasty things can you do to them or their data?  You know, like
e-mail bombings etc.  I don't need particulars, since this is pointed at a
mainstream audience.  (It also might not get published if the technophobic
editor(s) think its too risque, if you know what I mean.)  I have some
ideas already, but I'd like to hear from the pros. :->
Thanks in advance for your help.
