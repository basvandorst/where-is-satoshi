If you don't vote, your opinion literally doesn't count, and means that
you are perfectly happy with the status quo. Not voting guarantees that you will have no voice.  Perot's name will be remembered a lot longer than some nuts whining how about the process doesn't work. The best way to protest the current system, is to vote for something else. I'm a Libertarian rather than a Perotian, but I give him a lot of credit for allowing so many people to see beyond the two party system. Vote with your feet, not with your butt.

Assuming that there is some EEPROM, or bipolar fuse PROM (like PALs) they can easily be programmed during the final (packaged) test stage. After the device passes its tests, give it a number. There are already some PALs that have a "silicon signature", a lot number embedded on the chip, which allows process or lot tracing of devices that don't work up to spec.
Testing on peripheral controllers is well below 5 seconds each (gross ballpark - not giving away any secrets here) CPUs may be more, but a "wire-tap" chip should be much easier to test than a CPU.  Testers can run close to 24 hours a day, and 24*3600/5 is 17,000 chips a day from one test head. QFP trays have 50 chips/tray, and since the tester knows when the trays are full, it can easily
use this to form lot/tray/batch,etc numbers, as well as individual device numbers.
I don't like what they're doing, but it all sounds technically feasible to me.

Ah, if only it were so...
Apparently you haven't heard about the new nomination for attorney general.
A prosecutor from Florida with a "get-tough" reputation. Undoubtedly an
anti-drug warrior. And since "everyone knows" that the only reason to hide
information from our "great benevolent government" is to "cover-up illegal
activites", I'm not quite so hopeful.

bit parochial, but I promise its related...  I just heard a few minutes of their 'Forum' program. The topic was local reaction to Clinton's visit by spokesmen for SIA and AEA, plus the head of SGI. (Semicon Industry Assoc, American Electronics Assoc, Silicon Graphics)
Someone called with concerns about privacy and wide spread use of encryption in cyberspace. If he had left it at that, a question about privacy, which everyone can grasp, he might have had his question answered. I would like to hear what these people had to say on this important topic. But no, the guy went off into a 'statement' about how the goverment wants to interfere with 'digital money', and the moderator cut him off, dry. No disscussion - substitute some other question about jobs.
The moral of the story is - KISS! keep it simple, when talking about
these issues to the general public. Privacy in the electronic age is something that everyone can understand. And quite a few 'regular' people are very much concerned. Offer wide spread public encryption technology as a solution to the problem.  But PLEASE, don't gum up (public) disscussion with esoterica like 'digital money'.  Most people don't even understand how 'regular' money works :-)

The "readability" of the relatively high energy sweeps in a standard CRT monitor
is well known. Any idea of similar effects on LCD screens ?  The energy involved
would be orders of magnitude less, just for starters.  Also, since the whole screen
is effectively oscillating, I'm not sure that there is any 'raster' sweep per se
going on here at all.  This could be a factor for the truly paranoid :-) using portables with LCD screens.

Mr. Cramer is highly regarded for his scolarly work in regard to the Civil War, and the political history of the Second Amendment. He has just published a book on the later.
His other 'opinions' have always amused me somewhat, because he was one of the first net.people that got me interested in the Libertarian Party. Those rantings seem very out of step with this general political attitude, quite un-libertarian, in fact.  Pete Carpenter                           pete at cirrus.com
