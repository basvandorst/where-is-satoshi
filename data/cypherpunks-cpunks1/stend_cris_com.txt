and, while it raises some valid questions, it in turn has some internal
problems.  For example, the IW author apparently doesn't understand the
difference between a Navy captain (O-6) and an Air Force captain (O-3),
dismissing the whole story because a Navy captain would be far to old to
be a 'whizzkid'.  Problem is the story said it was an Air Force captain,
and a newly pinned AF captain would certainly be young enough to be
considered one in the military culture (had I stuck it out through ROTC,
I would have been able to make captain at 24).  While the ET article
looks like it was written by someone who didn't understand the fine
details of what happened, the IW article looks like it was written as
military smokescreen.

really said?  The age difference between an AF captain and a Navy
captain is enough that one could be considered a 'whizzkid' in the
military, while the other could not.

here, and it makes people who made comments on the _original_ version
look like fools.  Next time when you quote a corrected article, please
note that it's been corrected.  The difference between an AF captain (4
years of service) and a Navy captain (17-ish years of service) is
substantial when when judging whether they could be considered
'whizzkids' in this environment.

1) The correction makes a difference in the credibility of the
statement, as you must have felt, since you made the change.  Saying
that a reporter called a 40-ish Navy captain a 'whizzkid' is foolish,
while questioning the reasonableness of a reporter calling a 20-ish Air
Force captain a 'whizzkid' is a difference of opinion (see below).
Since you said it was the 'actual text', you should have posted the
actual text, not your correction of it.  If they sent out two messages,
one correcting the other, I find it somewhat difficult to believe that
they didn't at least preface it with a "sorry, we goofed" tag.
FC> Even with only 4 years of service (after graduating from College),
FC> 25-27 years old is no longer whizzkid age in my book.
2) As I said before, had I remained in ROTC, I would have been 24 when
I was eligible to make captain.
3) At 26, I was still being referred to, by non computer-savvy people,
in terms comprable to 'whizzkid'.

FC> the second independent source, the Captain was working with the
FC> Navy's support and knowledge.  How much do you want to bet that the
FC> story changes again by Tuesday?
4) The original story said that it was a "secret experiment" conducted
in front of "Pentagon VIPs" "at the Electronic Systems Centre at Hanscom
Air Force Base".  Saying that the Navy was informed that this test would
be made, or that Navy personnel were among the watching VIPs, is
unremarkable, and does not call into question the original report.
There were many security 'surveys' conducted against my systems by AFIWC
(sorry, I don't remember the name of the specific group that does the
surveys, but it's part of AFCERT) which I was unaware of which were
authorized by the Air Force - in fact, I wouldn't be surprised if the
"young Air Force captain" was from that group.
5) The second independent source backs up the report that the connection
was made through the Internet, involving email connectivity, and with a
personal computer and modem, all of which were specifically denied in
the message from IW.
IW, do you see why I characterized it as a military smokescreen?  The
only thing in it which remains unchallenged is that the original report
is inaccurate in detail, and that there is a question as to whether
someone in their mid-20s is a 'whizzkid'.

given 3 preselected sizes.  You can select one of the sizes, or enter
your own choice.  Actually, the pgp source will allow 2048, but there is
a bug in the DOS version (from the compiler) that limits that one to
2047.  The international version is identical to the domestic one,
except for the RSA code, so everything is interoperable.  There is a
hacked version that allows 4096 bit keys, and the supersized keys are

serious doubt), after a point the IDEA session keys become far easier to
use a brute force attack on than the RSA keypair.  Since I think that
increasing the RSA keysize is supposed to double the attack time, if a
RSA key size of N takes as much time to break as 1 IDEA key, making the
RSA key N+8 bits makes it better to break the IDEA keys of 200 messages
rather than the RSA key.
time to break the IDEA session keys used in PGP vs time to break RSA
keys of various sizes?

reporters (Harry Reasoner, I think) purchased various fake IDs, ranging
from drivers licenses to 'green' cards.  The green cards he purchased
were virtually indistinguishable (in quality - the names varied (; )
from his genuine green card (the reporter was/is Canadian).
