I should have asked this years ago when there was more traffic/users on this list (and I was using a different nym[1]) ... but years ago there was not such established proof of data correlation in "anonymized" data sets (netflix, "anonymized" medical data, etc.)
So, in the post-netflix, post-aol-user-data[2] world, I am doing the following to sanitize my online nyms:
- establishing a distinct user account, on a different provider, for each topic I discuss.  For instance, this nym only discusses encryption/"yro"/tor subjects.
- Scrubbing my language of certain idiosyncratic phraseology or blatant aspects of "style" ... favored slang, etc.  Perhaps even purposefully bad grammar in finer points of grammar that most people get wrong - so as to keep the "correct" forms from being identifiable.
- Forged user agent / email agent headers
- Never referencing my own _actual_ published works or comments, or linking to myself or my work product in even a second-hand manner.
These actions are probably not robust.  My thought is that it can lower my common profiles below the noise threshold that a particular aggregator might have.
What do _you_ do to sanitize/de-correlate your nyms ?

@_subject: fingerprinting traffic at ISP for big content 
Recent events related to "big content" pursuing individual file sharers based on ISP logs are _very interesting_.
My first thought is that this usage is tracked via filename - you are guilty until proven otherwise if bittorrent traffic indicates a filename that matches [Hh][Uu][Rr][Tt].[Ll][Oo][Cc][Kk][Ee][Rr].
But this seems shaky to me ... certainly bittorrent, already demonized, combined with an incriminating filename can shake loose a quick settlement, but in the long run this seems unsustainable.  Maybe they extend it to HTTP and FTP, etc., but you've still got an unknown file, interesting only in its name.
On the other end of things, the ISPs cannot be saving all of the data.
But what about fingerprinting it all ?  Let's think of a traffic backbone ... at comcast, for instance ... say 2 gigabits/s aggregate traffic ... the hashes themselves of all files (or, let's say, all files 100 MB in size or larger) won't take up much storage, but this is a non-trivial amount of CPU.
a) Does anyone know what method is being used for these pursuits ?  I'm assuming a low tech "parse filenames in unencrypted BT traffic" but I haven't heard any details...
b) Once lawyers and ISPs collude to fully exploit this "revenue source", what is a reasonable course of action ?  Can they hash all files at that rate of data transfer ?  I'm wondering if that investment would be worth the settlements it produces...

@_subject: distributed traffic patterns (for personal traffic) 
Virtual Private Servers are getting fairly cheap, and Amazon EC2 instances even cheaper.  A hundred or so dollars per month could put together a fairly large set (say, five ?) of general purpose unix nodes on at least 3 continents ... EC2 in Asia and Ireland, and then some bullshit VPS provider(s) here and there in the US.
So let's say you assemble a little quiver of these root shells, and your intention is to completely obfuscate your own personal traffic ... to just disappear completely (as an atomic, individual net user).
The technical foundation is pretty basic - just set up your own system, or perhaps a firewall at your home/office to block all traffic except for SSH or HTTPS and to take all outbound traffic and tunnel it over one of those to a random one of your systems.  Easy.
So at this point, what do you have ?  First, your own ISP no longer sees anything but encrypted traffic.  I suppose they also see time patterns, but you've pretty much excluded your own ISP from all information regarding your net usage.
Further, you've upped the ante considerably - an actor has to have a global eye view of the entire global Internet to collect a true portfolio of your net usage.  Maybe a few US nodes are easy, and maybe if you go EC2 Ireland, that's easy too ... but some VPS provider in Hong Kong ?  Seoul ? Sao Paulo ?
So where does this start to fall apart ?
First, if you hit any kind of personal/vanity/small sites on a daily or hourly basis, an attacker just has to camp out upstream from there and collect all the source IPs that come in.  So if you run your own mailserver (or whatever), this falls apart almost immediately.  You either need to start hosting a lot more traffic on your own server (giving away accounts or something like that) or you need some kind of jumphost that isn't connected to you, and an out of band link between the jumphost and your own site(s).  This isn't rocket science, though ... just set up a big ubuntu/freebsd/whatever mirror next to your own vanity host, and cross connect with an ethernet cable over non routable IP space.
Second, unencrypted login sessions ... between web forums and chat rooms and any number of other things, somewhere you're entering a user/pass over plain old HTTP... and if an attacker can guess one or more sites that they know you visit, they can, just like above, camp out upstream and just collect all of your proxy IPs.  This is easy to fix with a firewall rule, but may be impractical to deal with that way ... a certain discipline with nyms and aliases, etc., needs to be adopted, and unlike typical "nym leakage" you need to be thinking of nym leakage on an infrastructure level.  Not impossible, though...
Where else does this fall apart ?  I don't think there is a weakness with DNS resolution, since the dns resolution will come from your proxy, which will move around... presumably your local connection has everything but 22 (or 443) blocked.
Remember, this isn't Tor ... the idea here is not to create mathematically provable security.  The idea is to make ones own traffic disappear to a degree that one needs to be a nation state to put it back together.  The local ISP can't see it, the servers you visit can't see it, and the intermediate ISPs (and even a conglomeration of several of them) can't see And it looks like this is a fairly cheap thing to put together in 2010...

The threat model is not a current one.  If you are actively breaking the law _right now_, then all of this (including Tor, IMO) is out the window - you move to the realm of throwaway mobile phones and prepaid visa cards and open wifi networks.
No, the threat model I am concerned with is future correlation attacks and data mining.  I am concerned with a set of digital footprints that can be stored indefinitely and can be used to frame all possible motives.
So yes, Tor would work, but Tor is slow, and even with a large number of additional nodes and much more bandwidth, Tor will still have _very_ high latency.  If you read back in the Tor mailing list, you can see the devs state that while the bandwidth will get better over time, the latency issues are here to stay.  This is in contrast to a hop from CONUS over to Amsterdam and back to check nfl.com ... that's pretty snappy, I am happy to report.
So that's the threat model, and that's why I have declined to use Tor (I'm well versed in Tor usage and admin).
Payment is prepaid visa or postal money order, etc.  Most asian ISPs I have dealt with don't accept credit cards for service anyway.
As to cost, if $80 or $100 per month is too much, I guess you use Tor. I'm of the mind that this is extremely cheap for 3-5 nodes spread across the world, especially considering that this barely got you a single colo'd server 8 years ago.

Hi Eugen,
There's a few ways to approach this.
First, there are a LOT of co-location/vps/webhost resellers operating in the US, and almost no regulation of them as "ISPs".  The big famous ones that do shell hosting and irc and all of that will not work - they are very vigilant about customer validation because they get so much CC fraud.
But if you can find a joe-blow VPS reseller or datacenter reseller and call them up like any other vendor, they will bend over backwards to take your money.  They're not going to ask for your drivers license or a credit check or anything like that.  You can just mail them a postal money order or two and be done with it.  Most give you a discount for paying a year in advance, so that's convenient.
The other way to approach it is much more convenient, but potentially more risky, and that is to use an assumed name with your own credit card.  You will find that most CC auths are done based on the numbers, and not on your actual name.  Try it - you can set up a working amazon account with your own CC and a totally bogus name.
Since most (all ?) merchants are required by their banks to dispose of the CC information, or never hold it in the first place after authorization, after your transaction they are left with your bogus information (but correct address) and either a hash or the last four of your CC.
This is worth considering, since we aren't guarding against "being raided right now", but rather against future data mining ... and if future data mining traces an IP back to an account that had (possibly) the same address as you ... it gets a bit hazy there.  The hunt is for a name, and that name is not there.
So that's some food for thought - I have it on good authority that all of the above works very well ... and we haven't even gotten to prepaid visa cards, which aren't exactly rocket science to procure and use...
