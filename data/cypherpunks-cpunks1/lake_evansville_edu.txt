@_subject: How Many Games of Chess: Exact answer given! 
i am not sure this is a very reasonable question without any restrictions.  while this answer is humerous, i don't think anybody has addressed the fact that i can move a king back and forth between 3 squares infinitely many times.  POSSIBLE answer: uncoutably infinite?

@_subject: Survey 
I am thinking of composing an essay for my WC203 course.  I was wondering
if anyone who has a second could send me a message with their cumulative
GPA. If you have already graduated, what was your GPA?
If you have never attended school, lucky you.
Please send it with the subject: GPA.  Thanks.

@_subject: alias in phone book 
I have recently been participating in a thread concerning anonymity and pseudonymity on the Internet.  Somebody was complaining about trying to find somebody and they were logged in with an uncorrelatable alias. (Fishman = Don Johnson????)  The person was asking for a rule that everyone log in with an alias that DIRECTLY correlated them with their "real world" (relative term) pseudo.  Yuch!!!!! What I was wondering was if any of you law hacks out there new anything about the following comment regarding phone books
A professor of communications has brought up the fact that it is illegal to use a pseudo in the white pages of the phone book.  Is this the case?

@_subject: USWA 
I have a thought.......
Did anyone ever think of involving the USWA (no, not the United States Wrestling Association) United We Stand America in the Clipper fight?
Sounds to me like this would be a mass appeal if it appeared in their
newsletter.  For anyone who doesn't know, this is Perot's egg hatched a few years ago.
I would hope somebody on the list has a contact/is a member.  Despite his
weak performance in which he was GORED on CNN, I would think he would be
a definite ally. lake at uenics.evansville.edu

@_subject: Pondering Clipper 
Heard enough about Clipper?  I have been receiving cypherpunk material for about a week now.  I am new
to cryptography, and new to security(feel free to laugh).  I hope this
posting is appropriate.. Well enough excuses for what I am about to say
but I might like Clipper. 1.) From what I am hearing (largely propaganda from both sides) Clipper
will be OPTIONAL.  If I am businessman X and I don�t know squat about
security (but realize it is a good thing) wouldn�t I want something I
could feel secure with?  For me, wouldn�t Clipper be a good thig?
2) If, for some reason, I wanted to keep something even more secure so
the government couldn�t see what I was doing, couldn�t I just encrypt a
message before or after it goes through the Clipper Chip?  I would think
this would prevent the government as well as anyone else from reading my
message �en route�
3) Right now I can pick up cellular phone conversations and intercept data
through any network lines with a datascope. For anyone who doesn�t wan
this to occur wouldn�t it be nice if they couldat least be reasonably certain that no one could understand what they are hearing or seeing? 4) Also, would it be unreasonable to have an on/off switch on the Clipper
chip? merely trying to form a logical, educated opinion on the issue.  I will
always feel skeptical when the FBI say �we just need this to maintain our
current state of survellience capability (or is that survellience state
;-) And I am also aware that if anybody thinks these keys will be kept
confidential �unless the government has a warrant blah blah blah� well I
better stop there.......... lake at uenics.evansville.edu

Fellow cypherpunks:
Your Clipper worries are over.  Cracker Jacks will soon offer a Clipper decoder ring in a few select boxes of Craker Jacks;-)
