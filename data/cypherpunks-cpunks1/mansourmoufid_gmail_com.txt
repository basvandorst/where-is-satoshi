Very interesting read.
I'm not sure I buy the theories for the new data centre. Drive capacity
has increased on the same order of magnitude as Internet traffic, [1,2]
so I doubt the increase in traffic from current targets is the reason
for it. I also doubt extending the surveilled set by 5% to include the
US is the reason.
Besides, according to the whistleblowers, everything that's attributed
to it has been going on for a long time. Unless there's concrete evidence
I haven't heard of, I tend to believe it actually is for "cybersecurity",
specifically the insider threat. These agencies monitor their own people
(and soon-to-be corporate partners) far more than the public.
On that note, apparently there's half a dozen versions of HR 3523 around,
and NSA versus DHS (aka "the happy face") is an artificial distinction,
meant to appease. [3]
Anyway, I think cryptography will depend more and more on steganography

Very true, unfortunately, almost all publicly available steganography is worthless. But that's just an opportunity to do better, and there's promising research. Check out:
