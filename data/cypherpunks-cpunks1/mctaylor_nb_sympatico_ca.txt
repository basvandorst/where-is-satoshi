As of March, 1997 Consensus Development ( stopped
licensing RSAREF for a very reasonable amount (~$200 US + 2-3% range I
think it was??) Consensus' "SSL Plus" toolkit requires licensee to also license BSAFE from
RSADSI. Maybe too many people were using commerical RSAREF licenses rather than the
BSAFE toolkit.
