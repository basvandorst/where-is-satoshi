@_subject: [liberationtech] Drones for Human Rights 
I would venture to guess that a considerable factor is resources. Recent
FOIA responsesstate
that keeping a Predator drone in the air for 24 hours requires 170
personnel. Granted this is a) a Predator drone, and b) few (if any) on this
list would argue that the Military is an exemplar of efficiency, there is a
time and expense in supporting drones with a considerable range. I support
thinking about positive ways of exploiting technology but a greater
question might be: what is the goal of the operation?
I agree with the proposal that "Drones can reach places and see things cell
phones cannot." and I think on that front, there are a number of innovative
ways to approach transparency. For example, this past year students in
Chile useda
weather balloon and an iPhone to provide coverage of a protest. Along
this line of thinking, what is the range, the type of coverage, and
requirements that should be considered?
