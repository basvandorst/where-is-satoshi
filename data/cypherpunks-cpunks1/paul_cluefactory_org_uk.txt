Have you looked at the design of SPKI CRLs?  I think there are
possibilities in there that address the difficulties you raise.

[snip reasons a, b and c]
I'm sure you've thought of this, but there's also a reason (d):
because the most convenient component for a particular application is
vastly more secure than you need.  When using a cipher as a component,
you might as well use a ludicrously strong one like Rijndael or
Blowfish, because there's nothing to be gained from using a weaker
one.  Good locks are more expensive than bad ones, but strong crypto
is free.

I agree on both counts.  But I can see another use for larger keys
than resisting brute force attack: they increase the difficulty of
attacks on protocols and constructions based on inducing collisions in
