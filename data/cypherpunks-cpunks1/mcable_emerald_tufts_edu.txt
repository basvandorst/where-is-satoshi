Fraid not....it's a trivial matter to fake the username, and if yer a smart cookie, faking the hostname is just as easy.
actually....the people on  (not -s, -z) just sit around and discuss how eLEeT!@ they are, then kick everyone off, hardly a revolutionary        \|/		  wozz at wozz.ext.tufts.edu	   Matthew Cable

@_subject: Public Key Servers 
I'm looking to set up a public key server at phantom.com, supporting both 2.3 and 2.5 keys.  Who should I contact for information and source to work from?
With the moving of BAL's server to 2.5, i figure we could use another server here on the east coast.

@_subject: Key Servers... 
Question for all of you.
With the announcement of the 2.6 release, there is a specific mention of Keyservers which accept 2.6- keys violating RSA's intellectual copyrights...
This has coincided with the dissapearence of nearly all the key servers ....
Is something afoot?  And what do you think RSA has up its sleeve?
