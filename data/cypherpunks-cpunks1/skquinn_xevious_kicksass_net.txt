For a firewall, I'd recommend OpenBSD over just about anything else. Unless of course, there is hardware you need to use that isn't supported under OpenBSD.

But then, only if you use PGP (or GnuPG or what have you).

@_subject: Multiple copies of messages 
Just today, I started getting multiple copies of each message. Am I the only person this is happening to?

I noticed something similar when I voted in the primary this year. I
voted in the Republican primary, and there were *two* choices for
president: Bush and "Undecided" (or maybe it was "Uncommitted").
Anyway, my question: can you decline to vote on an office-by-office
basis, or is it all or nothing?

I was off the list for a while, and only rarely posted when I was on it. I just didn't have the time for the better part of a year. But, now I'm back into studying security/privacy/cryptography stuff so I'll probably be on the list again for a long while.
