How useful.  That'll really, I mean REALLY show 'em who's boss, as they shut the airport down and strand thousands of hapless travelers who I am sure will really understand your idiotic point.  Which is ... ?
Shit, all it takes is for you to put on some sneakers, run rapidly past the security checkpoint(s), perhaps open an alarmed door on your way out to the tarmac.  Do it at a hub, shut down everything.  Doesn't take anything as stupidly exotic as powdered explosive in your pantyhose, idiot.

"The costumes, the scenery, the makeup, the props
The audience that lifts you when you're down
The headaches, the heartaches, the backaches, the flops
The sheriff who escorts you out of town
The opening when your heart beats like a drum
The closing when the passengers won't come
There's no business like show business
Like no business I know
Everything about it is appealing
Everything the traffic will allow
No where could you have that happy feeling
Let's go on with the show
Let's go on with the show!
The show!
The show!"
Anyone who thinks for a nanosec that this is anything but showbiz is a total idiot.

Wiping out the airfields, knocking out the lines of supply, all of this is essential to getting several million Afghanis to flee onto the mountain trails, where the snows will soon get them. This is essential to rooting out terrorism by reducing the terrorist breeding grounds by several million.
But, cheer up! 15,000 more orange food packlets are being scattered from 15,000 feet. And, I hear, at least 400 emergency tents are being dropped along the Khyber Pass.

Given the overall context of the bill, the debate on the floor, and it's conclusion your report is shrill and Chicken-littleish, which does nothing for creating credible support of resistance to eroding civil liberty.

The wired-generation issue is that we don't need glib knowitall half-information or reporting that's packaged just like an SUV ad except it's for the socalled digiscenti.  The issue is that we need the best information that we can get and Declan's superficial reportage of the Congressional debate does NOT fulfill the need.  I don't know how you could interpret my post as being anti-civil-liberty, what my post was about was: back up what you're saying because half-measures, half-thinking, halfway responses are not good enough.  This is not "The Operating System Wars" for christ sake.  Our lives are at stake.
We need reporting that can go to the bone and get real becuase it's all so fucking packaged and showbusiness - and Wired's no better than CNN.  I need data - not someone running around regurgitating the same Chicken Little stuff as last year, or 1993, or 1991. Show me.  Show me.  Goddamn it I want to know who's saying what so I can get some truth.  Admitted to whom?  When, where?  If we are going to do the job, do it right.  Otherwise don't do it at all.  Otherwise it's just another crypto-jihad sort of madness.
And that again is not all true, from the portions I read in the one transcript.  Ther is debate.  But I need details.  Who's not debating?  Are you sure?  In other words, to perform a service in the interests of the cause of preservation of civil liberty, we need accurate, in-depth reporting and truth, for that is the only antidote to the ignorance and darkness.  And if the people on this list can't belly up to that bar, then you should just admit to yourselves you can't provide anything of value in this battle.  Tim, you're of independent means, Declan you get paid to think through this stuff.  Some of us have to feed families.  Help us, and own your part in the struggle as others of us must do in ways you may not ever find out about.
IMO a worthless sentiment at this particular moment because it thinks only of yourself and not of anyone else - but I know you're a codger and I expect that sort of response, that's OK.  But there are people with a wider responsibility, or who present themselves as having taken on that mantle of wider responsibility, so I'm hoping they stand up and do the job they have to do.
I'm 'hiding' because the C130s over your place are over mine too.

"nyah-na-nah-na-nyah-nyah.  I know you are but what am I?"
Come on let's grow up.
Uh huh, yep, that's it fer sure, uh huh.
Idiots, there isn't a single place I call out for that.  I call for clear thinking of which there is so little.  I want good information and analysis, not kneejerk skyfalling pandering idiocy.  In your little book, if I criticize Declan I'm calling for regulating crypto.  Now that's rich.
My use of the this or that technology itself should tell you exactly that I don't support its regulation.  What I want is some really smart people to help keep the gov. from becoming more frightening than the terrorists, in the smartest possible way, and if you read my posts to Declan you'll see that.  Looks like this list is the wrong place.
The whole point is that his analysis is somewhat superficial with respect to the nature of the threats from the legislation, while at the same time he runs around blaring "Warrantless Carnivore" because it's all that fits into the cognitive scheme of the audience and he ignores the subtle context of the intent and the struggle that is going on in the hearts and minds of the grownups who are trying to come to terms with what to do. To imagine that by bouncing the rubble (so to speak, sorry) of all the old arguments yadda yadda, we are going to have any effect on the current process, is naive and childish.  It's a new game, running in circles screaming and shouting is not going to win it - So what is?  Well, we need more info on the cast of congresspeople and where they stand.  We need to objectively understand the ramifications of legislation like what's proposed, and it needs to be done to the mass audience and not to the tired Wireds.  We need advance notice of upcoming discussion in Congress.  We need to understand the minds of the people on both sides of the arguments in order to have effectiveness.  We need accurate unbiased reporting, identifying the critical battles.  We have to choose those battles in congress, because to keep chanting the same undifferentiated rhetoric will create or reinforce such a credibility gap that it will be easy to ignore the whole unruly mess.  Create come credibility, knowing the mind of those who do not share your views.
God you guys are smart - try to apply it now to good effect.  Now, are you clear that I am not your little pigeonholed vesion of what you think when you hear something besides your own regurgitated rhetoric?

I am enjoying, in a macabre sense, watching the great Rorschach Test that events have turned out to be, where everyone's own impression of the world is reflected in their interpretations to a much greater degree than usual.
Everyone is acting like a bunch of assholes, snotty know-it-alls, children, and infantile technoids. And most of us are ostensibly more on the same side than not.  It gives one pause with regard to the behavior between people who DISagree about these and similar kinds of issues. Aimee - is this predicted in your worldview?
I've seen Declan and Tim doing this even more so, but there are deep issues regarding the clash behind the theory of Reputation Capital and the Cypherpunk mandate that anonymity is an essential component of privacy.

It's a way of bonding together and excluding "outsiders."
No, I'm not new to the list.  And I'm not worried about it.  But I definitely detect a heightened level of anxiety in the posts.

"The survey showed that between 69 percent and 95 percent of respondents favored granting police additional powers to tap telephones or intercept voice mail or e-mail, as well as to hold foreign terrorist suspects indefinitely. 'One sacrifice Americans said they are willing to make is in their civil liberties,' the newspaper said."
NO NO NO ---- 69% to 95% (what the fuck does that mean?  Junior-high school students couldn't get away with that kind of 'statistics' nonsense) of Americans are ready to give up OTHER people's civil liberties, since they themselves have nothing in their brains that anyone could possible be interested in.
They obviously have no concerns about wiretapping, or holding "foreign terror suspects" because all they do is sit around and watch AOL and Disney-TV.
