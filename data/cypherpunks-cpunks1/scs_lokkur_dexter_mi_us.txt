Darned close.  The article I saw said it detects the period of black
and silence and puts a `notch' on the tape at each such switch.  The
notch can be detected at fast-forward speeds.  My question is - what
happens if there is black/silence *between commercials*?  How does
the VCR know that what follows a mark is show or merely the next

You can access the entire house through  has a number of good references to legislators; you may
be able to find your senator through it.

And a number of people would no doubt start boycotting Dr. Freds company
loudly and publicly should he attack an innocent third party such as
toad.com.  Fred and Perry are two peas in pod, but as long as they
keep their disputes strictly between them I could care less.

. . .
If this is the same case I read of two or three years back, it
should be noted that not one but three safety interlocks had to fail
simultaneously -- one human, one hardware, one software.  The software
glitch has gotten the biggest play in the press, but it was not the
sole cause of the problem.

Oh, puh-lease.  Do you often send anonymous mail to cypherpunks with your
co-workers and friends looking over your shoulder?  So much for your
anonymity and security.  I dunno about this theory of reputation stuff,
but you've sure developed one.

Two words: identical twins.
Two more workds: gene therapy.
The first generates non-unique keys, the second makes the code modifiable.

Since the previous Subject: in this chain was different, I presume that
aga installed the one quoted above.
Normally I just killfile these sorts of things without reading, but that
subject line caught my interest.  Clearly the author is using all three
as insult.
Let's thing about this for a second.  The author makes value judgements
based on body weight and sexual orientation.  What does this tell us about
the authors reasoning ability?
Congratulations, aja, you've developed a firm reputation based on your
public actions.

Cpunks has become an existance proof that the benefits of anarchy are

@_subject: Encrypted lists and ease of use 
Your solution is exactly what I want to do with the -encrypted list.  The
reason we want two is that 80-90% of what goes across the list is not
sensitive.  That kind of thing we want in plaintext for nice tools like
grep and glimpse.
