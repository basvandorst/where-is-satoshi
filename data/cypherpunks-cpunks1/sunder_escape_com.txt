Don't forget the Wolf 3D "beta" she removed the virus out of. :-)  She was actually using ResEdit in one of the scenezez, but don't know why they kept on flashing all those hex dump black screenz.  After all, all they had to do was install MacsBug on the machine and hit the programmer's switch...  instant way to show code, and would have been even more realistic... (though some would use McNosey or The Debugger Except for having the "ESC key" virus travel to the Dept. Of Justice mainframe from a Mac (I'd like to see a virus do pull that one off!)  The rest was fairly believable to some extent.  The moral of 'The Net' was of course that you shouldn't trust your machine's security to some off the shelf package 'Gatekeeper.'  Trust only 'Cypherpunk' Brand Software ;-)
She made some very big mistakes in her actions.  First, there are such things as backups, she could have convinced her lawyer to go to the DMV and force them to restore her records from tape.   Her fingerprints and photograph would appear... or more than likely look her up in the paper files.  I'm sure she got her first license waay back before they stored graphics on machines from the timeframe of the movie, her age, etc.
Shouldn't have been too hard to pull that off.  It may be easy to modify a series of computers and alter all records with a full set of back doors, but you can't change backups that are in the vaults of a government agency that easily. :-)
Things are starting to look up for us if Joe Bloe sees these movies and learns about security and crypto -- even if it's by watching movies.
don't forget in the Net, Angela used several cell phones which led straight to her even though they were stolen... and of course the bad guy was listening in on all her conversations. :-)
Also how did she get into the Moscone Convention Center without a badge; I didn't see her swipe one from someone... just snuck right in..
The thing that I liked most about this is the parralel between James Gregg and Bill Gates.  :-)  Not quite as obvious and forward as it should have been.  All Mac's and no Windoze 95 screens anywhere!!!!  I think Bill is well pissed about that.
                                                                   =====

Why not, she had the right 'assets' for that scene, no? 8-D
Makes sense, too many geeks without a real-world-life out there.
The security was laughable.  But consider that most of corporate Amerika is this way.  Very few care about security.  Here at work I have to fight extra hard with idiots who log in and leave their machines -- users with Supervisory access!  All sorts of shit like that...
Re: ip  Yeah, it's like all the phone numbers in every movie are 555-xxxx.  Probably they didn't want to get sued by posting a real net address and get sued.
That was after she got the milnet address though nice email address that can be telnetted into.  But the voice synths are possible.  Apple does provide that capability.  You'd have to get the irc client to use it.  Don't know of any that do off the top of my head but I haven't looked for it either.  It wasn't much of a "hot" chat.  It could have been much steamier.  The sex content of this movie was pretty lame though...
More secure to fedex a disk.  Nobody on the net can read what's not on the net. ;-)  Now if the author of this movie knew about pgp... totally different story.
Yeah, that was quite bad.  That was my impression too.
Yeah, death to MS-Bob...  >:-)
Not unlikely.  A lot of trade shows do provide machines with net access as demos of the internet.  Though it's usually manned by the ISP and not out in the open.

@_subject: a hole in PGP 
Agreed.  If PGP has a hole it in it's not in the sources, nor in the executables.  Any hole would be a breaking of the RSA or IDEA cyphers by the TLA's who wouldn't talk about it, or the availablity of enough super fast hardware to brute force it.
It wouldn't be that PGP, it's sources, or algorithms have holes.  It would be that there is a way to factor RSA that as of yet we don't know about.  And hell, that's as likely as meeting Elvis at your local 7-11. ;-)

One way to achieve this is to provide multi-layered generic "compression" hooks which get called in this manner:
 Compress[x](char *bufferin, size_t insize, char *bufferout, size_t *osize);
Then you chain several of these by alternating the in/out buffers, say something like this:

Unfortunatly, the lusers here are brain-dead and don't care about anything.  They don't even know the first things about DOS.  We do have a couple of geniuses who think they know Windoze (or want to learn it) who occasionally play with the icons and groups: one such genious once closed a group window, then claimed someone "erased it."  What a dork!  The worse is that I have to clean up after them no matter how stupid they are.
Well, the loopback is only a single IP address.  If they used that, every net.entity would have the same IP.  Not too good. :-)
Nope, sounded right the like the Apple MacinTalk II Pro voices.  They've got some really cool voices, some even human sounding.  Check it out if you get a chance.  Real intonations: you can hear the voice flex, etc.  There are some voices that follow songs or other tones.  (i.e. Big Ben, Bells, etc.)  They sound like they're singing.
Yep.  Those be the same machines where I dropped my Cypherpunx PC EXPO V2.0 disks.  Just left a few dozen infront of each machine as I used them.  Sort of the sleight of hand that theives use to lift stuff; only I didn't take, I put. >;-)

Please, all you need is to go down to a computer time rental place that has a color scanner and a color printer and you can print any ID you like.
Take a picture of you, scan it in, bring it to a word processor or publisher program, write some text next to it like "Anon Y. Mouse Inc.
Joe Sixpack, Vice President of Operations, DOB: 4/1/69" print it, cut the
edges to make it look round, and get it laminated.  Instant I.D.
Worth as much as used toilet paper when it comes to your True Name.
I can do half the operation right now on my home machine.  Just have to get the camcorder out and hook it up to the video capture card to get the picture, then take it into Publish It Easy, write the text and put the picture next to it.  Only thing I'm missing is a color inkjet printer and a small laminator, but I can print to a poscript file, take the file to Kinko's or wherever and print it there, buy a laminator for $40 and I'm set.
Hell, another $200 and I can get a decent color printer too.

Unfortunatly, this is a wetware being; I did have the pleasure of meeting him at a speech given by him and Dave Mandl a few years back.  He did an excellent speech, and was very informative.  At the time, being a neophite cypherpunk, I found the info enlightening.  But alas, his human interaction skills rate below what one would find in a kindergarten.
He's not a bad guy really, just vicious when it comes to manners.  At times, he takes the net.cop attitude.  And we all know how well that works in an anarchistic organization/group/entity such as the cypherpunks.
He's a great cryptographer/programmer too from what I've seen.
At times, I do respect his skills, but his attitudes belong in /dev/nul.

Eh, what do "virus hackers" have to do with encryption, why is it these morons justify the destruction of encryption by mentioning hackers and Additionally, does this mean that someone outside of the USA is in danger of being grabbed by RICO armed thugs from Uncle Sam's cadre for writing crypto software and publishing it in the open?  After all, once it winds up on some USA site, how do we know that someone outside the USA got his copy of SuperDuperNSASpookFree from a non-US site?  Just to be sure, we'll bust both the site operator and nab the guy who wrote it next time he drops in, or hell, we'll have him extradited.
Yes, whenever man develops a privacy increasing technoloy, the spooks will see to it, that they abuse everyone's rights to that privacy, and then some!
Where is Elliot Ness?  I don't see any mafia.org on the net.  Anyone here see any such site?
Was it not proven that McVeigh and Co. >DID NOT< use a computer?  THe AOL account was a hoax, no?  Where are the hoardes of anti-USA terrorists, and drug pushers on the net?  Certainly, I see no drugs.com site... web, ftp, email, usenet or otherwise.
Ditto above.
Yeah, so, why blame citizen units in the USA for actions outsiders committed.?  Why limit the spread and use of cryptographically strong tools from being developed in the USA?
If Joe Badguysky breaks into your house and steals your copy of PGP, then exports it to his fatherland, should I arrest you for that?  What if he breaks into your store and steals a copy off the shelf and exports it?  Why punish the victim?
Oh, the poor poor LEA's.  If they can't prove you're guilty (because you aren't, and there is no proof because you aren't,) let them throw you in jail anyway.
And this type of bill is where the potential for abuse and harm arises.  The harm of course is to those who will be thrown in jail for wanting Gee, who is scared?  Don't be scared, be Big Brother. :-(
Circular reasonings and politician's spewing?  I can see th masses applauding this... all wearing PJ's and bearing shaved heads watching Big Brother on the screen infront of them...
So, what countries are left free of encryption regulations? (English speaking preffered, with affordable net access.)  Time to see about getting a new passport...

Erm, not quite.  Stealth viruses supposedly use "encryption" to hide themselves, but then, I shouldn't mention this, might give El Federale a bit more fuel to burn us with.  (But even these beasts can be caught easily if you know how... i.e. create a large executable that does nothing but quit to the operating system.  Run it every day and compare it every day.  The day it changes is the day a virus infected it.)
Still, you could write beneficial viruses, or virus like programs that are beneficial in nature in some way. KOH for instance?
However, none of the above has any iota of anything to do with linking the four horsemen of LEA's to crypto in any real-life-already-proven situation in any significant numbers.  Banning crypto for EVERYONE in order to catch maybe, what, two zit-bearing kids hoarding beaver shots downloaded from alt.bin.erotica.pix a year is a tremendous loss of everyone's privacy.
Hell, at this point, my guess is that the mafia(s) doesn't use crypto, or that if it does, it can be caught via other means.  A strong, well developed crypto system in use by the mafia would more than likely never happen... not until mobsters get into computers.  Ditto for terrorists.
If they did use crypto, I suspect they wouldn't get caught.  (For the paranoid, assuming they used crypto, and they didn't get caught, then the FBI or other TLA is doing the same as the gov't in Farenheight 451... pick someone else, and jail them.  Otherwise, how do you explain all the jailbird mobsters?)
To LEA's out there:  Get a life, get off the net and go bust some murderers.  Stop attacking easy targets.  Do your jobs.  Confront the real criminals.  What's the matter?  Is it easier to go after crypto geeks than it is to arrest drug dealers who shoot back?

Seriously bad for my financial health.  I write code for a living (though I'm a Netware LAN Admin in this incarnation of a job.)  Going somewhere where I can't make money writing code because 10 billion folks will have it after one pays is my idea of jumping out of the microwave oven into the boiling lobster stew.  :-)
If such systems would be maintenance free, it would be cool going around place to place installing data heaven servers all over the place.
Hell a 1Gb hard drive is only $350 or so.  A cheap XT, or lap top hooked upto such a drive, say 4Mb of RAM and a 28.8Kbps modem would be good enough.
Say some junky assed machine no more than $500 a pop...
I would guess we could get a small enough package to hide in say... under the subway tunnels, or in the sewer system, and hook'em up to existing power lines....  Now if we could hook'em up to a phone line easily, it would be a great thing to have.  But how do you hook into the phone line without the local MaBell getting interested?
Enough of these things hooked up all over the place would be cool.  Everyone can ftp to the server, write or read, but nobody can delete.  When the drive is full, the server goes read only.   Instant (free) data heaven.  Get a few million of these up, and hey, you've got instant, unstopable info servers.  Very hard for any government to catch all of these.
On the other end of el-spectrum d'data heaven is the pay service.  You upload, you pay $5 a meg, I burn your megs on the CD.  You want the data back, you pay me $50 a meg and I make it available again.  :-) You'll be rolling in cash in no time.  I don't need to know who you are or what files you sent me.  Just tell me the date and time stamp of the file my server got your file and after I get the $50, you get to download the file.
Pay me in cash, e-cash, or no-name money-orders. :-)
Excellent business, no?  Hell, you could probably set something like this up in the USA right now...  Even more easily with a 1-900-$5/minute number.
As long as what you send me is something I can't see, I don't have any risk and neither do you.  Or you can snail mail me a 1.44Mb floppy with a special file name and I'll take the post_mark date and the file name and your $5 and burn it on the CD.
Expensive enough to keep pirates away, cheap enough to make corporate data worth backing up remotely.
Cost: ~$10K or so...
 Good pentium server running Linux $2K, 28.8Kbps modems ~$220
 each, need no more than 2Gb of hard drive space... (650 of which you set aside for the CD burning.)
 CD Burner ~$1700.
 blank CD's for $8 a piece in volume, etc.
 Good sized data-grade fire proof safe $????
You can hire high school kids to burn the CD's in or your relatives, or do it yourself.  Very nice setup.

WORKSHOP DETAILS
What: 	A free workshop on current online censorship legislation and
      	the viable alternatives.
When: 	Saturday July 22nd, 1-4pm
Where: 	ACLU offices at Times Sq (132 West 43rd St at 6th Ave)
Who:	Everyone (teachers, librarians, businesses, everyone!)
Agenda:	
  Crash Course on the First Amendment and the New Censorship Legislation   Questions and Answers About How the CDA Affects You and Your Business   How to Lobby Your Representative   Plans for the New York Lobby Day Against the CDA:  Wednesday, July 26th WHY YOU SHOULD ATTEND THE WORKSHOP
Are you interested in seeing our government become less intrusive, not
larger, and less involved in personal decisions about what you read?
Do you believe that Constitutionally-protected speech should not be
regulated by the FCC (or any other Federal agency)?
Do you believe that computer networks are a tremendously powerful tool
for giving many more people in our society a voice, bypassing traditional
forms of media?
If you find the above three questions compelling, you should be
concerned about the 1995 Communications Decency Act (CDA).  Having
already passed the Senate, the CDA is headed for the House and has
favorable odds of passing there as well if nothing is done.
The CDA was passed by the Senate 84-16.  It was voted on by many
legislators who not only never use a computer, but have never read
email, logged onto a BBS, read Usenet news, or seen a Web page.  They
were simply voting with their gut reaction, unaware that they were
disastrously affecting the future of American expression and the
most explosive industry seen in the last ten years.
It *doesn't* have to be that way.  We as New Yorkers can't expect our
elected officials to vote out of a vacuum.  We need to tell our
Representatives that online systems are a new medium, not the same as a
telephone, nor the same as television.  They need to understand that
the Internet and bulletin boards aren't simply Dial-A-Porn lines, or
adult cable channels.
However they won't come to these conclusions themselves; they need your
help.  Come to this free workshop and learn what you can do to help
ensure that online communication isn't restricted unreasonably.

For those of the anonymous pay-me-in-(digitial/physical)-cash only underground types, yes.
Speculation of course.  No better, or closer to the truth either one way or the other?  (Any of you anons work for the mob?  if so, is the mob Two logical possibilities.
  0. Mobsters still get caught and thrown in jail.
  1. They don't use crypto at all.  All records are in the open and searchable.  LEA's wet dream.
  2. They use strong crypto and can't be caught at all.  LEA's nightmare.
  3. They use crypto, but are still catchable (oops, the secret is out of the bag now, cancel all the computer related RICO nonsense.)
  4. They don't use crypto, but keep no records, or hide them well.  They can still be caught by LEA's.
  3 & 4 are the most likely, and the LEA's shameful little secret.  They cry wolf to set a wolf trap, but meanwhile they're hunting wabbits, not wolves.  Errmm.. precisely the reason to stay away from them.  While the first few parts of your above paragraph are quite tempting, the last sentence is deadly.  You can't quit from your "family" without cement shoes.  So I'll stay away from that line of ...um... work.  + ^ + |  Ray Arachelian | Amerika: The land of the Freeh. | \-_    _-/  |

Well you know there is a Mac version of Linux -- not sure if it's available for PPC yet.  there also is/was a version of FreeBSD a while back too.  (Don't know any details as I haven't done this myself yet.)
You could just add another hard drive and run Linux off of it, or install it on a SyQuest cartridge and set the startup disk to point to your SyQuest drive.  If you want Linux, start up with the cart.  If you don't, startup without it, or with the drive off.
Then you can have the best of both. >;-)

In article ,
Ray Arachelian  kept the nurses distracted long
  enough to write:
If they are a Licensed Interchange Carrier they must (by law) provided
call records and caller id information on court order. If they fail to
answer the court order they could loose the right to operate as a LIC.
If they are not a fully licensed carrier, they can have all equipment impounded if they do not honor the court order. Ask anyone who knows telco-law. Let's say you call someone with call-id and do something silly like
tell them "I'm going to kill you and your boyfriend, leave my bloody
glove at the scene and drive away in my white ford bronco." This scares them. The person calls the cops. The cops call the number on caller id. They track down the service and
tell the service- "Give up the call records or get closed down."
What do you think the carrier will do?
I say this all the time, if you want privacy- Don't use the phone.
Here are some things I've heard: (Not responsible for blah blah...)
1) Most caller ID equipment will not display Caller ID from calls  made at IDSN phones. 2) Most digital cell-phones have the same quirk.
3) Call-id does not work when calls are made from digital PBXs in  Japan.
4) Call-id does not work when calls are made from digital PBXs in most  parts of east-block Europe.
5) This happens only in Nynex land and will be fixed by 1997. (yes, 1997)

Thanks. :-)  MachTen though isn't freeware as Linux is. :-)  The problem I have with it is that it's a hosted OS and as such is limited to the Mac's problems.  i.e. - lack of true preemptive multi-tasking and protected memory.  Though the M680x0 series and all Mac motherboards can support both preemption and protected memory, Apple in its grand wisdom (or lack thereof?) is only now writing it into the next version of it's OS.
Other than that I love the Mac. :-)

@_subject: Hooks to Crypto (was Re: NSA and the NCSA/Apache web servers) 
The answer is to have some non-USA entity build shareable full fledged full powered crypto libraries and provide them for free for the rest of the world and for all machines.
On Windoze DLL's or WIN32's would be needed, on PPC Mac's shared Lib's, on 68K Macs, an INIT that hooks itself via Gestalt, on Unix, shared LIB's, etc.  I would also include routines for asking the user for a passphrase to prevent the running application from grabbing that password and providing weak security.  Or a program running in the background that handles all the calls via IAC's or whatever... (like AppleEvents to PGP)
All with full free source, etc and PGP compatibility, etc.  Then the rest of us could write code that uses that library.  Whoever wants crypto just downloads the library from whereever and uses it.
In this case, would code written in the USA be exportable?  Wei's library would have been perfect for something like this... too bad. :-(

@_subject: mac share/freeware app for overwriting unused hd space? 
Something could be written to just write a bunch of random garbage to a file until the volume runs out of free space, then overwrite that file several times before deleting it.  I think this is what MacTools's Trashback - EraseFreeSpace option does.  I used to do this for DOS machines with a batch file:
Type this is at the DOS prompt (for those who use DOS):
COPY CON FILLDRIVE.BAT
 OFF
 >>KILLME.TXT
 KILLME.TXT >>KILLME.TXT
   (hit RETURN ON THIS LINE AND THEN HOLD CONTROL AND HIT Z,
                  and RETURN again.)
Just run this until you see hard drive full errors.  This creates an exponentially increasing file called "KILLME.TXT" by copying that file to itself on each pass.  First pass the file is the size of the directory, the second pass, it's 3 times the size, the third pass 7 times, the fourth pass, it's 15 times, etc.
When your finnally run out of space, hit CONTROL-BREAK and then delete the KILLME.TXT file to release the free space.
Basically, no matter who I work for, I write a batch file that zaps the SecureDevice file on the root directory, then runs this thing, so if I have to leave the place in a hurry I can erase my personal files without much hassle and little danger of having them compromised.  (I also have a few other neat tools to let me know if someone has been snooping on my machine at work, but I won't disclose those :-)
Do this a few times and everything is cool.  Off the top of my head, the unix equivalent would be:
ls -l >>killme.txt
cat killme.txt >>killme.txt
But be careful not to run this when other folks are on, or if you're not the sysadmin as you'll overrun your quota very quickly.  (The above wasn't tested, and I'm not sure if under unix you can append a file to itself, etc. so  In this day and age drives are getting smaller and smaller while the capacity increases. This means the tracks are smaller and the data spill caused by the jitter is smaller and smaller tending towards almost useless.   I really think our TLA friends are having a harder time at this than usual.  But suffice to say I still do a wipe three or four times anyway.  i.e. It's easy to do something like this on a 5.25" full height 40MB MFM drive, but on a 4GB 3.5" LPS drive, much, much harder.
(I guess though, I must be paranoid though as I did buy a nice big bulk eraser built for floppies. )
