@_subject: Books on cryptography 
Just a quick question...and painless at that.
I have available to me an almost complete set of books on Cryptography
from the Aegean Park Press. The question is, are these books worth
reading (there are a whole bunch of them) ? If only particular ones are
noteworthy, which ones are they?
I guess I should have said a couple of questions...
These are my views and not those of the United States Government,
The Department of Defense, The Department of the Navy or the Naval
Postgraduate School. ** Carl R. Forsythe              ** Naval Postgraduate School     **

Our site is preparing to implement the PEM package from Trusted Information
 systems. The package is available to US/Canadian users from ftp.tis.com
 Any comments on this package would be appreciated. It appears to use a
 licensed version of RSAREF. But I just got the docs, so I can't say much
 else about it. "Sometimes we get lost in the darkness,
 The dreamers learn how to steer by the stars"
