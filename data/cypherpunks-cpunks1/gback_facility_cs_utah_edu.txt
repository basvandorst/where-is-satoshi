What offset do you mean? The offset in the struct as in C++?
Java bytecode does not store such information. Fields are
accessed using putfield/getfield, which use an index to a
field reference in the constant pool. (pg. 66, lang spec)
Field references contain a name index (pg. 19) which points
to a name, i.e., a CONSTANT_Utf8 (pg. 18) field.
To my knowledge, the Java, and Java bytecode does not imply
any memory layout. I doubt it makes sense to demand to check
that 'offset do not overlap in memory'.
Could you describe in more detail the manipulation you are
