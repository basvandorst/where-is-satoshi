@_subject: Teaching Cryptography to 5th graders 
I saw this post on Avi Rubin's blog today about his preparation for
teaching a class of 5th graders cryptographic principles.
It is a nice post, and I thought the list would be interested despite
the lack of eliptic curve cryptography in the lesson plan.
I am at least excited to hear how it went.
