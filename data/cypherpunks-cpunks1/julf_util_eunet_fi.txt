@_subject: A message to decision-makers 
I have been contacted by somebody editing a book about how telecommunications
are changing the world and our society.
To give an example of the kind of stuff they are going to have in the book,
there's going to be something by Ross Perot on teledemocracy etc...
They asked me to help them in getting "messages from young people around
the world, messages directed to the decision-makers, containing views about
the significance of telecommunications and the change in perspective that
telecommunications cause".
So, if you want to have your point of view presented in the book, please
send me a shortish note (in English), along with your name (or pseudonym),
age and state/country. The deadline is Friday morning.
