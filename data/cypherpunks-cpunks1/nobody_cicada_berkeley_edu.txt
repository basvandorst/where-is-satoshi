@_subject: another remailer (again?) 
Yes, it's the second remailer I've set up today.  Gee, at this rate, I'll
have the entire CPU power of the United States dedicated to remailing
within four months.
Just do the usual thing:
mail hh at cicada.berkeley.edu with the header line Anon-To: or
Request-Remailing-To: and the remailer does the rest.  cicada and pmantis
have been able to compile pgp201 and so they will soon have encrypted
remailer capability.  They will also soon be running pgp21 (as soon as I get
a chance to compile that).  They are very fast machines, so I will probably
give them military grade keys.  They are also very secure machines.
It's too bad about not being able to use the ocf, but those machines are
slow anyway and probably wouldn't be able to run pgp ever.  My soda remailer
should be running pgp fairly soon.  And I have 1-3 remailing sites almost
ready to go, probably coming on sometime next week.  And hughes is working
on another remailer at soda, a really fancy one.
Have fun everyone!

This is another call for info from remailer operators.  I only heard from a
few of you.  Please send me info about how to use your remailer, including
the public key.  I will be setting up a special mailing list for remailer
operators so we can discuss the technical issues of remailing, so if you
mail me, you get on the list (if you want to).
Remember, the more remailers there are and the more they are used, the safer
it is for each individual remailer operator.  And people won't use them
unless they know how.  And they won't know how unless there's a directory of
hh at soda.berkeley.edu

Time for the long distance providers to extend the use of personal
identification numbers from calling cards to residences? One PIN per
authorized user. This would have saved me from getting the shaft from one

It is at best ironic to see the Chairman and CEO of TRW appointed
to the President's National Security Telecommunications Advisory
Committee, given the sieve-like nature of TRW's data collection.

Well, it made it, I suppose.  I'll try this one via the same remailers,
plus another one I know to be working.

@_subject: Remailer Abuse? 
hh at cicada.berkeley.edu says:
Interesting.  I wonder what those drastic actions would be? People sending serious death threats and the like through anon remailers
should be aware that those actions are considered seriously anti-social
and may cause them some problems.  But I don't view "kiddie porn" the same
way.  Its very definition is VERY ill-defined, and there is widespread
disagreement on how much of an evil threat to truth, justice, and the
American Way it really poses.  This makes me start to think that borderline
policies like this should be well publicized by the operator of the remailer.
I don't support the kiddie porn witch hunt going on in the U.S. currently,
and would not have assumed that posting what many people consider to be
harmless photos of kids under 18 would get someone automatically turned in
to the cops.  (Again, keep in mind that the definition is very fuzzy.  Some
people who have been busted as kiddie pornographers have been busted for
extremely mild and un-pornographic material that no reasonable person would
consider harmful.)

Eh?  I don't think you're talking about the same case:
1) GM lost a $100 million dollar lawsuit: parents of a dead teen sued GM,
   they alleged faulty design caused the truck to explode.
2) NBC ran a story about these exploding trucks.
3) GM claimed the trucks were rigged to explode.
4) NBC consistently denied anything of the sort.
5) GM did their OWN extensive investigation and proved NBC fudged the
   results.
6) NBC finally admitted to rigging the experiment.  They fired three top
   execs of "DateLine" to COVER THEIR ASS.
This is crap.  NBC went through great lengths to cover the truth until
it became clear GM had them.
If for some reason you think eliminating ``pseudospoofing'' will
eliminate disinformation, you're way off since if happens ALL the time

I've got friends who've had unlimited, unsupervised access to color
copiers at their schools or offices (art students, designers).  It's
not such a big deal.  I have even color-xeroxed currency several times
(mainly for a zine I used to edit, wherein we encouraged people to
deface money).  The reactions of the employees of the copy shops ranged
from complete indifference to "you know, this is illegal," but I never

@_subject: "tentacles"-- I don't get it!! 
I hate to intrude here but I have been seeing all the smoke out in
the newsgroups about this "tentacle" business and L. Detweiler (who
is this guy??!). I hope I won't be flamed so I am sending this
through a remailer. (I love your technology, one of my friends
went to a cypherpunk meeting once and told me about the cooler
stuff.) I sent L. Detweiler some of these questions but he never responded, so I was hoping people here could help me
understand what is going on out here!!!
So anyway...
Could someone define "tentacle"?
Detweiler said, out in the newsgroups:
I don't agree with that in the least. (With what he says they did, not
the paragraph itself).
I have followed this thread for such a short time (relativly speaking).
I think I picked up on the "Cryptoanarchist" part (someone who doesn't
support the regulation of cryptography?). From what I've been able to
gather, the talk is about "tentacles" coming from one "Medusa." So many makeshift terms here that I'm not familiar with. Could someone Define "cypherpunk." (I HAVE heard of "CyberPunk," but couldn't extract a meaning out of that either.) Please enlighten me.
What trash is this? The only thing I have seen (so far, as I believe)
are various messages written by an12070 (L. Detweiler?) that have erupted into
flame wars. Keep in mind that I'm NOT FLAMING ANYONE here.
CyberAnarchists... Is that someone who doesn't want CyberSpace
regulated? Personally, I have nothing against the free exchange of
information (does anyone here?).
I was really upset when he said
is this one of the "violent death threats" that everyone has been
talking about?
thanks for the help, I just want to know. sorry that I missed some of the earlier stuff. I will be watching this list for
a reply.
BTW that stuff that Detweiler is doing with signatures, switching
them around, it is kind of ironic given that the cypherpunks are
really into that thing. He seems to be really pissing you guys off.
but I gotta admit it really is a sort of new art form in cyberspace,
kinda like Graffiti. although, there is so much activity lately that it kind of makes me wonder if there is a whole team of people
out there. there have been a lot of rumors about infiltrators and
double agents. we'll see what the future brings. personally I think remailers are God's Gift to Cyberspace, and anything done to limit their capabilities or infringe on the privacy of whoever uses them is CENSORSHIP and ORWELLIAN POLICE STATE. we'll prove to Detweiler that we are not the hypocrites
he claims we are, that under no circumstances whatsoever will
we *ever* betray the people who use our remailers, even if they
are our enemies, because Privacy is all that matters.

So that's why all those weirdos have been showing up here lately. Detweiler is really becoming a nuisance...

@_subject: Remailers needed NOW. 
Thanks to Alan Barrett for help with this silly command-line computer
interface, and to all the "Mr. Remailer Operator"s out there. I have
succeeded in automating the task of sending Gary Edstrom's PGP FAQ and
my "Here's How to MacPGP!" guide, chained through two remailers, selected
randomly. You can all worry a little less about not having enough traffic.
Julf can relax now that I'm no longer pumping 1-3 MB of mail through
I think this should not bomb any remailers too badly, unless they are very
unlucky with the roll of the dice (and I'll see that happening and back off
anyway). Each "session" will involve me waking up in the morning and firing
off between zero and maybe ten packages (5 x ~45K).
The following remailers have worked out, in being fast enough on a regular
basis for me to run a <5 minute "Ping!" test round with a small e-mail to
myself, and not stripping the Subject header from the e-mail. I had to remove
jarthur since it today as is so many days, is adding at least an hour delay so
I cant ping it conveniently.
      1  hh at pmantis.berkeley.edu <-[Very fast.]
      2  elee7h5 at rosebud.ee.uh.edu <-[Very fast.]
      2  hfinney at shell.portal.com <-[Fast. Warning header.]
      1  hh at cicada.berkeley.edu <-[Very fast, may die and bounce mail.]
      1  hh at soda.berkeley.edu <-[Very fast, may add an hour.]
      ?  catalyst at netcom.com <-[Fast. Warning header.]
      2  ebrandt at jarthur.claremont.edu <-[Fast, often adds an hour.]
I will however continue to ping jarthur. I imagine I will get to know these
remailers very well, and learn their characters. If I cause any problems, let
me know (the list is faster than anon.penet.fi) and I will adjust my ways. If
it doesn't work out, I can switch to a Netcom account or something instead.

@_subject: Superping Script 
Anon asked for a copy the "SuperPing script". I don't know much Unix and
no perl so this is may NOT be the "correct" way to do this, but it WORKS
for ME. I am in the csh shell by the way. This got word-wrapped; the
original has the first three lines as ONE long line (happy editing! I just make
it on the Mac then use 'ed', 'a', paste it in, '.', 'w SuperPing', 'q', then
'chmod u+x SuperPing'). I might get flamed for this silly script ;-).
.PingFile is a small text file.

P.S. I almost forgot to edit out my real address. Anonymity is NOT a
thing to rely on, if you don't keep changing names or use encrypted
remailers. Already over seven "Mr. Remailer Operator"s probably know
who I am. This was why I didn't use these remailers till I HAD to. At least
I still wont get 5AM phone calls from people asking me to send them PGP
on a floppy, after they finger me.

"The commercial providers, like Netcom, Portal, and Panix, cannot be

Idea: make a Netcom remailer fake mail, so the recipient will have no idea
where the remailer is. If it doesn't say catalyst at netcom.com on the from line
Netcom wont ever hear about it ;-).
