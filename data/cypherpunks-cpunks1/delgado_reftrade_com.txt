@_subject: Hello dear! 
Hi, my dear friend
A woman is not an object or a trophy, a woman is a living person, with feelings, with a heart that beats, with a soul that is hungry for love, for life, for recognition and a mind that aspires to have its place in the Every person has to realize their dreams, you have to realize yours, I have to understand the dream and help you reach your dream you will love me for being always behind you and always catching you when you fall or when you are down, this is what you should expect of a woman and this is absolutely the only way that you could be happy, of that, I am totally certain.
Honestly, the first letter should be enough to have a feeling if someone is meant for someone and if the person is serious this is not only because the first impression counts, but because the first letter shows the true person and the true person is the person you will live with, the person you will love and who will love you with incredible respect, incredible passion, incredible love.
I hope you liked my letter, and if you are interested in my please let me know So long
July K
