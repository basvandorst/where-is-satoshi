@_subject: [NOISE] Barring access to Netscape 
Just a personal note... while I am strongly in favour of security, this
seems rather petulant and knee-jerkish.
JeffW: Please add a configuration option to let users override the "Mozilla"
ident, so that they can continue to use Netscape at all sites.  I personally
won't use the override, though; if a site is going to insist on trying to
frivolously exlude me as a user based on nothing but the browser I choose to
use, they aren't serious anyway.
The _market_ establishes standards (been proven time and time again).  His
reaction sounds pretty childish to me, but YMMV...

@_subject: PRINCETON STUDENTS FIND HOLE IN INTERNET SECURITY SOFTWARE 
I've always read with interest Sameer's notes, and I also enjoyed this one.
I just can't figure out why he's writing it (spelling and grammar errors aside):
This title and the opening paragraphs seem unnecessarily (and
misleadingly[*]) alarmist, given the recent spate of similar mass-media
articles.  After the lead and second paragraphs repeatedly talk about
"holes", "make viruses and other malicious programs possible", etc., it
isn't until the third paragraph that we read a calmer quote:
[*] Java isn't really 'Internet security software', and the students didn't
find a hole in any current version according to the rest of the text.
The opening paragraphs sure didn't reflect this.  Then:
They do?  It's not?  Then... why mention it at all?!
If this is so, it's a dead issue, old news, passe'.  Why another alarmist
press release (other than to promote Community ConneXion's decision to add
Java to its hit list )?  The public's paranoid enough about
net commerce; why should we, of all people, fan the flames?
This isn't to bash Sameer, whose posts I always enjoy reading.  I'm just a
bit puzzled by this one...

@_subject: PC disk wipe software - SUPERWIPE 1.04R 
Thanks for the post.  Just a thought: there is dead space at the end of
virtually all files, not just small ones.  On average, half a cluster is
wasted at the end of any given file.  Only files that happen to be an exact
multiple of the cluster size won't have wasted bytes (on my main drive, with
a cluster size of 16K, on average about one file out of 16,000+ wouldn't
have any wasted space).

@_subject: Basic Flaws in Internet Security and Commerce 
To repeat a comment I made in sci.crypt... the described hole applies
equally well to a program (virus or other) that sits on a workstation and
intercepts calls to OS file services.  This is particularly pernicious on
platforms like PCs, but are there any platforms that don't have this
potential flaw?  The main question, in my mind, is: How can a user know he
is even running the app he thinks he's running?  Once you have an attacker
who can intercept OS file system calls, it seems to me you can know
-nothing-... checksums are no use, signatures are no use, nothing is any use
at that point -- including keeping your authent software on a floppy,
write-protected or not, since it can simply be patched as it's read in, or
the system may just execute a different program altogether.  In fact, if
it's properly done, there may not be any way to even detect that the system
has in fact been subverted.
So: If you can't trust your path to your own file system, what can you
trust?  (And this is without even talking about things like firmware
upgrades and BIOS patches and all sorts of other potential approaches.)  Can
we do no better than simply assume the local workstation file system can be

Use the 32-bit DOS version; that solves most memory problems.  (Caveat: I

@_subject: Anonymity: A Modest Proposal 
Using a set public key?  Which would mean the remailers all share the same
pub/pri key pair (or pieces thereof)?  You'll have to come up with a good
way of maintaining this secret, since if you're not careful it could be
compromised by something as simple as an attacker's trying to attach a new
remailer to the remailer group or physically attack any existing remailer.
Not only is the anonymity of the entire traffic load compromised if the
single shared private key is compromised, but even if the secret is kept the
newsgroup articles' headers being posted in the clear still opens this
scheme to traffic analysis (even if you put it a short random remailer
delay, as you say later on; computers are very good at sifting through large
volumes of data to find this kind of pattern, especially if the remailer
delay's upper bound is known (you proposed two hours)).
...and if someone installs their own remailer and adds it to the group, and
therefore it must get the complete shared private key at some point (of
necessity, else it couldn't decrypt the messages), and then the attacker can
just look at the key and decrypt all traffic...?

@_subject: Another Netscape Bug (and possible security hole) 
Don't just look at this bug, though... check ALL your static buffers and
include code to check for overflow writes.  For example, if Netscape is
written in C or C++ and the above code uses strcpy(), you could change
strcpy() to strncpy() everywhere (and then set the last char to null in case
strncpy() didn't).  Your programmers will know what I mean.

@_subject: WordBasic and other macro languages 
It's no worse than the other hundreds of products that have macro languages
that can write files (even the ones that can't execute other programs are
dangerous if they can write a real executable to a file and, say, add a
corresponding RUN= line in a WIN.INI or the equivalent to get it executed
later).  Word's is just more visible because the macro itself can behave
like a virus, because of Word's autoexec-macro feature that can make the
macro run automatically unless they user disables those options on his copy.
Many versions of PostScript have this kind of hole, I understand; some
disable the file-manipulation commands to be more secure.  I remember
hearing recently that Ghostscript, popular on PCs, is one that does have the
file-manips, but all of this is hearsay so I can't say for sure.

While I'm at it, here's a question I've been wondering about recently: Why
is it I've never heard of any security issues with Lotus Notes?  Are there
no known weaknesses?  Or did existing weaknesses just not get much press
because Notes isn't a commercially visible consumer product like Netscape?

Good point.  However, since it's been around for years and is (in some
people's eyes, at least) cutting-edge secure replication technology, it made
me begin to wonder about the product's actual security.  All I know is that
they use one of RSADSI's libraries, since RSADSI mentions them in their
"here are our current users" advertising.
information or opinion either way on Notes' security...?

@_subject: Wild Idea for RNG 
Warning: I'm no expert, my response is just a semi-informed opinion
(emphasis on "semi-").
                ^^^^^^
Your randomness will depend on the prior randomness of your original
input... and if you already have that, the TM won't give you any additional
randomness (rather, this approach will just take all the randomness you give
it and reduce it to 1 bit of randomness, losing all the rest).
On the other hand, if the 'random' program is not already truly random, then
you may well have patterns in the bits generated by the halting observation.
For instance, if you use a known PRNG to get your "random" programs, then
given the same seed you will end up with the same programs (and therefore
the same resulting 'random' bits from the TM halting output)... which, in
other words, gains you nothing AFAICS over simply using the PRNG's output
directly, except of course that it exercises your CPU. :-)  The attacker
still only needs to figure out the seed.
Not on my machine (or most others, I'd wager)!  I thought about this, and
whenever I'm running Netscape (for instance) my screen is probably identical
over 50% of the time because I tend to have the same things open when I run
a given program.
Even in the general case, consider that most people have a preferred desktop
layout (in Windows, they have ProgMan sitting in one place on the screen
with usually the same groups visible/open)... not only will that piece of
the screen bitmap not give you any randomness from one run to the next, but
unless you go looking for "things that haven't changed since last time" your
program won't even know what's reducing your randomness.
Better, but be careful how you use it; that's what Netscape thought too. :-)
This sounds a bit better... except, of course, that when you initiate a
secure session in Netscape with a specific party/server, your screen has a
very good chance of looking the same each time you connect with that entity
because it is the same URL. :-)
Would someone who's more informed please correct my analysis?  Thanks in
