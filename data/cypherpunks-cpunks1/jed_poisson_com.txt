Dimitri Vulis KOTM (dlv at bwalk.dm.com)
Regulars of the Cypherpunk mailing list would be well advised to pay no attention to Dimitri Vulis who is in the latter stages of dementia caused by the syphillus he contracted from his wife Marina. How sad.
Of course, in his rare lucid moment, he lies just for fun. So, enjoy. :)
