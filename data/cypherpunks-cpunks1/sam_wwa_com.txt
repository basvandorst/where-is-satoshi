Yo, some bozo subsribed me to this thing. Who's the administrator? I want off (no offense; I'm sure it's an interesting forum, but I don't like being mail-bombed by way of forgery). Whoever administers this thing, I'd be glad of a copy of the headers on the message that subscribed me.
Thanks --
Scott Marquardt
