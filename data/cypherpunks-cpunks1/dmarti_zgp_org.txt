begin Donnie Barnes quotation of Mon, May 10, 2004 at 08:24:19PM -0400:
  In the TREAD Act of November 1, 2000, Congress
  required the National Highway Traffic Safety
  Administration (NHTSA) to develop a rule requiring
  all new motor vehicles to be equipped with a warning
  system to indicate to the operator when a tire is
  significantly underinflated.
    Each sensor had a unique digital identification
  code so that the particular tire with low pressure
  could be identified on the driver's display. The
  digital identification code also prevented signals
  from other vehicles' sensors from being analyzed
  by the TPMS.

@_subject: [linux-elitists] Obfuscated TCP 
Anyone following the "Obfuscated TCP" kernel patch
set and userspace library?
  Fast opportunistic crypto at the TCP level.
Looks like a useful way to make it difficult for
ISPs to use services such as Phorm and NebuAd to
collect user tracking data and ad revenue -- so
webmasters should be all over it.  And, of course,
it's protection against forged RST attacks.
Doesn't work if the attacker is willing to spend
more and do an MITM attack, though.
