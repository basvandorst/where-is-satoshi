   4.    5. Onion Routing Averts Prying Eyes
By Ann Harrison
Story location: 02:00 AM Aug. 05, 2004 PT
Computer programmers are modifying a communications system, originally
developed by the U.S. Naval Research Lab, to help Internet users surf the Web
anonymously and shield their online activities from corporate or government
The system is based on a concept called onion routing. It works like this:
Messages, or packets of information, are sent through a distributed network
of randomly selected servers, or nodes, each of which knows only its
predecessor and successor. Messages flowing through this network are
unwrapped by a symmetric encryption key at each server that peels off one
layer and reveals instructions for the next downstream node.
In contrast, messages traveling across the Internet are generally not
encrypted, and the path of a message can be seen easily, linking users to
activities like website visits.
The Navy is financing the development of a second-generation onion-routing
system called Tor, which addresses many of the flaws in the original design
and makes it easier to use. The Tor client behaves like a SOCKS proxy (a
common protocol for developing secure communication services), allowing
applications like Mozilla, SSH and FTP clients to talk directly to Tor and
route data streams through a network of onion routers, without long delays.
Onion routing does not guarantee perfect anonymity. But it helps protect
users from eavesdroppers who aren't watching both the initiator and recipient
of the message at the time of the transaction. Developers say Tor can be used
to prevent websites from tracking their users; block governments from
collecting lists of website visitors; protect whistleblowers; and circumvent
local censorship by employers, ISPs or schools that restrict access to
certain online services.
The Navy is financing Tor because it wants to hide the identity of government
employees who have long used anonymous communications systems for
intelligence gathering and politically sensitive negotiations.
"The point of the Tor system is to spread the traffic over multiple points of
control so that no one person or company has the ability to link people,"
said programmer Roger Dingledine. Dingledine and Nick Mathewson, both based
in Boston, are building Tor as a research platform with a worldwide community
of open-source software developers.
Their goal is to blend together a wide range of users and avoid the weakness
of many anonymizing services that are located on a handful of machines and
vulnerable to a single point of failure.
Companies could also use Tor for discreet competitive research, said
Dingledine, or to route their employees' Web browsing so employment sites
like Monster can't determine which of them are trolling for a job. "Plenty of
people don't want their source IP listed in Web logs, especially .mil or .gov
visitors," said Dingledine.
The security of the Tor service is proportional to the number of nodes in the
system. Tor is slowly scaling and looking for tens of thousands of
participants who can provide enough nodes to prevent the service from being
compromised by what the project website describes as "curious telcos and
brute-force attacks."
"The current Tor version very effectively builds on 20 years of development
in anonymous designs," said cryptographer David Chaum, whose 1981 paper on
untraceable e-mail, return addresses and digital pseudonyms set the
groundwork for the Tor service.
Tor is distributed as free software under the commonly used 3-clause BSD
license. About 1,000 users (it's an anonymous network, so developers aren't
exactly sure) are running the service in client or server mode.
The Tor network currently includes 35 servers that forward each data stream
at least three times. Each server averages 10 Kbps of bandwidth. Those with
reliable Internet connections, who can support at least 1 Mbps in both
directions, are being recruited as potential servers in the network.
Users are permitted to operate an unrestricted number of nodes. But
Dingledine pointed out that a well-funded adversary could sign up for a large
number of servers and potentially take over the network.
Those who want to operate Tor routers must therefore convince the Tor
directory server operators that they are trustworthy and reliable. Dingledine
said developers are trying to find ways to scale the system without having to
have a human check the integrity of every new server that becomes part of the
Dingeldine said the developers of another online anonymity project, called
JAP, were forced by the German government to insert a backdoor into the
program and were barred from revealing it. If anyone insisted on similar
measures for Tor, Dingledine said the community of open-source developers who
analyze source-code changes for each Tor revision would expose it -- as they
did with JAP.
"The reason Tor works is that it's free and available software," said
Dingledine. "If it was a closed source or a proprietary system, there is no
way to know."

Link: Posted by: timothy, on 2004-10-21 22:00:00
   from the beaming-it-out-there dept.
   [1]Dozix007 (Kurt Kaylor) writes "Daniel Sweeney, a technical writer,
   business reporter, and industry analyst is coming full circle in his
   series of wireless related writings with his latest book WiMax
   Operator's Manual: Building 802.16 Wireless Networks. Sweeney brings
   the WiMax 802.16 standard into the context of a ISP solution for the
   masses. WiMax is a recent standard from the IEEE that is similar to
   conventional wireless technology, however WiMax supports higher data
   rates and longer distance transmissions than other standards from the
   IEEE. This book drifts away from the recent flood of wireless books by
   conveying all needed knowledge to establish, understand, operate and
   potentially profit from an 802.16 wireless network, rather than a
   specific look at one aspect of the technology. This book is not only
   for the business minded, but for a consumer looking to establish a
   quality long-distance wireless network of their own." Read on for the
   rest of Kaylor's review.
   [2]Click Here
   WiMax Operator's Manual: Building 802.16 Wireless Networks is
   primarily a utilitarian book rather than conceptual. It provides a
   background in broadband wireless fundamentals, packet data, and
   overall network operation and management to enable a network operator
   to set up a network with standards-based equipment and to run it
   profitably thereafter. Sweeney notes early in the book : "Nothing is
   particularly admirable about purism in terms of wireless technology,
   and if wire line technologies serve the same purpose better over some
   portion of the network footprint, then wise network operators will
   avail themselves of them." This theme of realism in relation to the
   application of a wireless network is prevalent though out the book.
   Wired networks in the same footprint will almost always beat a
   wireless network in speed, reliability, and cost. This is primarily
   due to the previously created infrastructure available to Internet
   carriers. The goal that Sweeney promotes is to find an ideal region
   that has not yet been exploited by a wired service provider. These
   regions are ideal due to the low-cost setup for a wireless network
   compared to the cost of a wired network. Sweeney describes and informs
   the user of ways to find and establish these networks in an efficient
   manner to maximize profitability.
   Sweeney also discusses network security in the later chapters of his
   book. He acknowledges the increasing need to secure the network's own
   infrastructure, the safety of its customers, and a nation itself. In
   relation to wireless networks, Sweeney notes "[Security] is becoming
   increasingly important in network operations today and cannot be
   considered optional at this point." To this end, the network security
   section is devoted to security policies, secure electrical systems,
   cyber warfare, and other information on safeguarding your network.
   Another concern also addressed is the Communications Assistance for
   Law Enforcement Act. CALEA is a complex piece of federal legislation
   that expands law enforcement's authority to conduct electronic
   surveillance, including surveillance over public networks. Sadly, as
   of yet there is no real way to combat this intrusive act.
   WiMax Operator's Manual: Building 802.16 Wireless Networks is a great
   resource for businesses and individuals looking to establish their own
   802.16 network. I enjoyed the foresight provided in this book for
   potential problems faced by network operators. The honesty in the
   practicality of an 802.16 network as a realistic network solution also
   made the book a great resource. There was no fantasy scenario or white
   lies to convince a user of the merit of a 802.16 network beyond what
   it can do.
   The gripe I do have with this book is its complete utilitarian nature.
   A little more theory and insight into the standard itself would have
   been great. This book stands purely as an Operator's Manual, and not
   an exploration of WiMax as a standard, but rather a tool. Otherwise,
   this book was highly enjoyable and well written. I would recommend
   this book to anyone looking to establish a network beyond the
   standards commonly available (e.g. 802.11a - 802.11g). This book is
   unique in its topic and sheer honesty, and is one of the few
   references available on the specific subject.
