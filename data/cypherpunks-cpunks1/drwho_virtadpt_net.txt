This means that the batman-adv.ko module the Serval software package
includes will be installed and configurable.  It is a good mesh
routing protocol to use - it works well in our experience.
Also, if the manufacturer of the phone (or third-party firmware
installed on the phone) permits it.  Android v2.1 packaged by HTC is
dodgy at best in this respect.
Nice.  Thank you for the link.
No, and my statement was slightly incorrect.  Let me see if I can
clarify (read: have I had enough coffee this morning?):
Laptops and netbooks that are capable of booting from a USB key or
(wi-fi enabled mobile devices) can then make use of the mesh without
having to install anything extra.  In this way, minimally flexible
devices can be used with a minimum of hassle, while maximally flexible
devices (general purpose computers) can be used as both infrastructure
and client (due to the include desktop (KDE v3.5) and applications).
Plans to do so (including a meta-package for Debian) are on the
drawing board, but we want to get to at least beta before moving
forward on this.
It is also my understanding that the technology that will be used by
the Freedombox for configuration and control is very similar to that
which we are using for Byzantium Linux (Python and CherryPy, though
the templating libraries we use differ).
That will likely be unnecessary.  At least insofar as third party
router firmware is concerned (namely, dd-wrt), packages for mesh
routing software are already available and usable.  Our early tests
involved .apks of BATMAN and OLSR that 'just worked'.  We are
considering including .apk files for mesh routing protocols for the
top two or three opensource routing distributions in the Byzantium
library but again, we want to release a beta before moving forward on
Ideas for this are also on the drawing board.  Whether or not
appropriate jailbreaking methods will have to be included remains to
be seen.

A few times.  It doesn't play well with multiple layers of NAT, and it
doesn't seem to be compatible with some of the experiments we want to
run in the near future.  Plus, it's drawing a certain amount of heat
in Germany, which implies that other countries will be paying closer
attention to it.  Trying to explain that we're using RetroShare for
its distributed forum capability rather than piracy is probably not
going to be believed.
As I understand it, RetroShare uses your current public IP to contact
other current public IPs.  It uses PGP public keys for authentication
and encryption, and tying those to IP addresses that ISPs can use to
ID people may not be something some of us are interested in doing.
I'd rather consider the folks who are not okay with this
preferentially because the reverse can alienate people (I've lost a
few good friends that way, and learned that lesson the hard way).
Those are things I'd taken into account.
Thank you.  I hope it's feasible; I plan on starting experimentation
in the reasonably near future (December of 2012).

Looking at the illegal bit first, if somewhere is in bad enough shape
that you have to set up a guerilla communications network to assist in
disaster relief, chances are you've got a pretty good leg to stand on.
 IANAL, call your own,  That said, it's something a few of us have worked on.  There are a
couple of drones that are relatively low cost (most of them
quadcopters) that appear to have enough lift to transport small mesh
nodes for short distances and perch someplace to conserve motor power.
 The 3d printed quadcopters that Telecomix were examining might work
for this purpose ( To my
knowledge, we haven't examined this one
( closely because I haven't had
time to spend on HacDC's 3D printers.
For both models, the possibility of using hacked Android devices for
the network nodes themselves came up a number of times.  There is also
a hacker working on porting Byzantium Linux to the ARM platform,
because he wants to try it on the RaspberryPi.  We don't know where
he's at with that project right now.
It should also be relatively easy to repurpose a more conventional
model craft (like the toy quadcopters resembling Thingiverse entry
 above) into mobility platforms for mesh nodes.  So long as the
network node had sufficient power (I kind of like the idea of the
solar charger in an envelope kits that were going around at HOPE9 - I
forget who manufactured them but they're cheap and designed to be used
as trickle chargers) for wireless and the motors of the drone could be
shut down to conserve their power cells, the keys would be positioning
and stability of perch.

@_subject: [HacDC:Byzantium] October development sprint. 
Hash: SHA1
I know this list has been quiet since we got back from IS4CWM.  We're
still alive but swamped in our day jobs.
The question is, will there be a Byzantium development sprint in
October.  The answer is, I don't know.
Speaking only for myself, I'm exhausted, physically and emotionally.
My day job has been running me flat out since I got back to the States
and if I don't get some downtime I'm going to fall over.  Everyone
else is likely in a different position right now.
One of the things we're looking at is UCI
( a framework for system
configuration that is meant to be used under the hood of other things
(for example, the control panel application LuCI).  Haxwithaxe, as I
recall, is working on a Python API for it that would make it easier to
work with.  We might be able to leverage it to do the actual work of
configuring stuff for us (like starting and stopping services and
configuring the network interfaces) so we won't have to write code to
do that ourselves.  We got it to compile outside of a firmware environment on our laptops, so we know it's doable.
One of the things that we were debating while in Spain was the
direction the UI should go in.  There is a rewrite of the 'panel in
the works but it isn't done yet.  There is also a matter of the
sustainability of the control panel as a whole, which was brought to
light after talking shop with the Freifunk, Guifi, and Commotion
Wireless folks.  They're not having any trouble using LuCI to do what
they need to do, and I'm all for having one less piece of code to
maintain so energy can be spent on other aspects of Byzantium Linux.
We also discussed the possibility of migraing to LuCI
( so we don't have to maintain a
control panel, it's done for us.  We know that we can get it to
compile on non- firmware, we've done it.  The question is, is
it worth migrating to it?  Can we migrate to it without having to
rewrite a lot of it?  Can we write the modules we need easily?  Could
LuCI do the job of automagically configuring a node when it starts up?
Another possibility is a Python module called sh
( which exposes any and all shell
commands to Python code.  that stands to make things a lot easier.  So
does the Python module Wifi ( for that
matter, though in more specialized fashion.  The Python sh module is
already in the Git repo and the wifi module can be added, so building
packages and making use of them shouldn't be hard.
Something else we're kicking around is splitting some code off into a
daemon that runs in the background and configures everything on
bootup.  When the node first comes online it detects network
interfaces and configures them appropriately to set up a Byzantium
mesh node, and then when the control panel is actually accesses, it
will have a configuration all ready to display and possibly alter, but
by and large it'll be online and routing traffic.
We've also been doing some experimenting with different applications
for the messaging framework.  During the last sprint we set up
ejabberd nodes on our laptops and they worked as expected, but one of
the things we're uncertain of is whether or not a MUC (multi-user
chat) XMPP channel can be automatically distributed across all nodes
without their being clustered ahead of time (which is fairly tricky
with ejabberd, but might not be with, say, python-xmpp-server
(  If anyone
knows for sure, please reply to this, we'd love to know if we should
persue this avenue or not.
We also did some experimenting with Litter
( which is a truly distributed
workalike for Twitter designed for non-NATted networks that is
stupidly, brilliantly simple and good at what it does.  Every Litter
instance is a single instance, and IP multicast is used to broadcast
JSON messages to every other instance on the same multicast group that
it can reach (IP multicast address 239.192.1.100).  It listens on port
8080 so it's accessed with a web browser (the UI is entirely in
JQuery).  It uses SQLite for a back end, and all it does is listen for
new posts, see if they're in the local database, and if not drop them
into the right place in the timeline with a gap filling algorithm.  We
could use it (or more likely, something working along the same lines)
for the microblog/realtime chat application for the Byzantium mesh.
We also did some playing with Tahoe-LAFS but got mixed results.  I
couldn't get it going on any of my machines, but Haxwithaxe and Sitwon
did.  I'd like to give it another try to see what happens.
Anyone else?  Status reports?  New ideas?  Suggestions?  We really
need to have a sprint this month?

Welcome to the Byzantium list!
The last time Byzantium Linux was used in an emergency situation was
during the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in New York City.  We built a
version of Byzantium specifically for the use case of restoring
connectivity to the rest of the global Net if there was a gateway
because responders were encountering great difficulties coordinating
with one another and with external organizations.
We learned a lot of things there, chief among them that rapid
deployment is essential.  Sandy was the reason we built an
autoconfiguration daemon which pretty much takes the user out of the
loop insofar as configuring a Byzantium node is concerned, which frees
them up to do other things (like clearing out wreckage).
Unfortunately, we also learned the hard way that you can't necessarily
count on assistance from people during a disaster situation.  There
was an organization up there that promised assistance (in the form of
computers that could be used as Byzantium nodes) that changed their
mind at the last minute, which forced us to fall back on a backup
plan.  What we took away from this was that interoperability with
other mesh projects is essential, so we added interoperability with
the Commotion Wireless project while we were up there (and got it
working on the first try).  Since that time, we've been working with
other wireless network projects on automatic, transparent

We took some features out - this helped us make layers 1-4 of the OSI

is meant to maintain momentum, and now that we have a robust platform
to build on we can start adding things back at the higher layers in v0.4a.
