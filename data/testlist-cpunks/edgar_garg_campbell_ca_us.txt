@_subject: Announcing SecureDrive 1.4a 
This is to announce the availability of Version 1.4a of SecureDrive.
SecureDrive Version 1.4a replaces version 1.4, 1.3d, and previous
Release 1.4a is a maintenance release of 1.4. No new function is added.
Only module SDCOMMON.C has a non-cosmetic change, which affects
executables LOGIN.EXE and CRYPTDSK.EXE. For that reason, all other
executables still self-identify as release 1.4. They are in fact the
exact same EXE & COM files as release 1.4.
1.4a fixes a problem decrypting or activating a diskette or disk
partition encrypted with both a passphrase and a keyfile.
There are also some minor changes in SECDRV.DOC.
In the USA, SecureDrive 1.4a is not available at
    Colorado Catacombs BBS - 303-772-1062 (up to 28,800 bps, 8n1) -
    log in with your own name or alias.  Download SECDR14A.ZIP from
    the [F]ile menu.
    see ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/README for the ???????  in
    ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/I_will_not_export/crypto_???????/disk/secdr14a.zip
    See ftp://miyako.dorm.duke.edu/pub/GETTING_ACCESS for access to
    ftp://miyako.dorm.duke.edu/mpj/crypto/link/mpj/disk/secdr14a.zip
These are all controlled-access sites available to USA citizens and
residents only.
Thanks to the cooperation of Steve Crompton of the U.K., who worked
with me closely, I am able to also announce availability on an
offshore site,
  ftp://utopia.hacktic.nl/pub/replay/pub/incoming/SECDR14A.ZIP
If you perchance don't find it there try directories
    /pub/replay/pub/crypto/CRYPTOapps
    /pub/replay/pub/disk
which currently contains previous versions of SecureDrive. But as I
write, SECDR14A.ZIP has been left in the incoming directory for
several days.
Steve also uploaded 1.4a to
    ftp.ox.ac.uk/incoming
But it has been removed from there and has (so far) not reappeared
elsewhere. But previous versions are in directory
    pub/crypto/misc
so it might be worth checking there from time to time.
In case anyone in the U.S. Justice Dept. is reading this, Steve and I
were very careful to do this release without violating US export
restrictions. The only things I "exported" to Steve were "diffs" for
source changes from 1.4 to 1.4a, which themselves don't contain any
code capable of encryption or decryption. Steve combined those with
source for 1.4, which "leaked" from the US sites where I released it
months ago.
Steve compiled the new source code, and sent the new EXE files to me.
I compared the new executables to ones I compiled myself and verified
they match, bit for bit.  I then sent back to Steve detached signature
files for the executables.  Steve then put together SECDR14A.ZIP and
sent that to me for final inspection.  I then compared all files
against my "master" files here and verified that they matched. I then
shipped the SECDR14A.ZIP that Steve sent me to the USA sites. So the
USA release matches bit for bit the offshore release.
Here are the contents of SECDR14A.ZIP

SecureDrive Users:
It's been brought to my attention that the detached signatures
for two executable files in SECDR14B.ZIP don't verify.
   COPYSECT.EXE
   FPART.EXE
These were supposed to be identical to the 1.4/1.4a files, so the
same signatures were used. It seems the files were inadvertantly
re-compiled with a different version compiler, hence the mismatch.
Anyone concerned, can use the files from SECDR14A.ZIP, which are
still available, and should match the signatures.
It's also been said by a couple of correspondents that the listing
of CRC values from PKZIP could be easily counterfeited. Accordingly,
here is a list of MD5 digest values for SECDR14B.ZIP and all contained
  CHK-SAFE.EXE Ver 2.51 by Bill Lambdin Don Peters and Robert Bullock.

SecureDrive Users:
It's been brought to my attention that users who attempt to compile
SecureDrive 1.4b using Turbo C++ 3.00 are haveing a problem in that
the MD5 routine does not produce a correct result, so that the key
generated from a given passphrase will not be the same as the
pre-compiled version.  This is a bug in Turbo C++, not SecureDrive!
However, a bypass for the problem is possible by modifying SD source
as follows

New Utility for use with SecureDrive and Windows 3.1
I have previously recommended EDOS as a mechanism to allow setting
PGPPASS under a DOS window of Windows 3.1.  A user has brought to my
attention that a freeware utility, SETENV, that can be found at
that has the same function and also has a "password" mode for non-echo
entry.  I just tried it and it seems to work.
SecureDrive and Windows 95
I have gotten many inquiries about SecureDrive and Windows 95.  I
don't have a copy of Win95 myself, but, based on user reports, I can
report that SecureDrive 1.4a does work with Windows 95, but with some
1)Always run CRYPTDSK and LOGIN under bare DOS, outside of Windows 95.
Do not try to run either in a DOS window under Win95.
2)Run SECTSR and LOGIN x: /S in AUTOEXEC.BAT before other TSR's.
3)Run LOGIN x:  (prompts for passphrase) later in AUTOEXEC.BAT, but
before entering Windows. Enter the correct passphrase if you
anticipate needing access to the encrypted partition.
4)After entering Windows, use the Control Panel to set 16-bit disk
access. Use of 32-bit drivers may give direct access to the encrypted
data, which is very dangerous for integrity of the data.
I'm told step 4 may not be necessary if the encrypted partition has
its own physical disk. In this case, Win95 will automatically switch
to 16-bit drivers if the correct passphrase is entered to enable
access to the encrypted partition.
I've also been told of one instance where CRYPTDSK and/or LOGIN failed
to find the correct partition from the DOS drive letter. If this
happens, use the physical partition parameters, as explained in the

IBM TO PROVIDE GOVERNMENT WITH ENCRYPTION KEY FOR NOTES
IBM has agreed to provide the U.S. government with a special key that would
enable government agents to more easily decode electronic messages, in
exchange for permission to export a version of Lotus Notes that includes
64-bit security.  The arrangement provides government officials with a key
to the first 24 bits of security code, meaning that they only have to crack
the remaining 40 bits to decrypt a message.  U.S. Notes customers already
use a 64-bit system.  "We were desperate enough to try to negotiate a
short-term, pragmatic solution," says Notes developer Ray Ozzie.  "But we do
not believe this is the right long-term solution...  Our customers have been
telling us that, unless we did something about the security, we could no
longer call it a secure system."  (Wall Street Journal 18 Jan 96 B7)

AOL RECORDS USED TO SOLVE MURDER CASE
Fairfax County, Va. police recently obtained a search warrant for electronic
files relating to participants in an American Online chat room in an effort
to solve a murder in New Jersey.  The victim had met his alleged assailant
through a "men for men" chat room, and investigators say several other chat
room participants helped in disposing of the body.  One of them, a
24-year-old woman, is now charged with tampering with the evidence.  An AOL
spokeswoman said that it is the company's policy to comply with subpoenas,
and that although it does not keep records from chat rooms, it does keep
records of e-mail for five days before they are purged.  "We certainly
respect and abide by our customers' right to privacy, but we are also going
to follow the law.  We have 4.5 million customers -- that's the size of a
city.  When we have some problems, we have to deal with it responsibly."

This is to announce the availability of Version 1.4b of SecureDrive.
SecureDrive Version 1.4b replaces version 1.4a, 1.4, 1.3d, and previous
Release 1.4b is a maintenance release of 1.4/a. No new function is added.
Only modules SDCOMMON.C, SETENV.ASM and CRYPTDSK.C have non-cosmetic
changes, which affect executables LOGIN.EXE and CRYPTDSK.EXE.  For
that reason, all other executables still self-identify as release 1.4.
They are in fact the exact same EXE & COM files as release 1.4.
1.4b fixes problems setting PGPPASS from Windows 95, either inside
Win95 from a DOS window, or from the DOS 7.0 environment outside
Unfortunately, LOGIN still cannot activate SecureDrive decryption from
inside a Win95 DOS window.
This same fix also, for the first time, enables LOGIN to set
PGPPASS (as well as activate SecureDrive) from inside a
Windows 3.x DOS window.
CRYPTDSK also contains added warning msgs for 1) attempting to encrypt
drive C: and 2) interrupting en/decryption with Ctrl-Break.
There are also some minor changes in SECDRV.DOC.
In the USA, SecureDrive 1.4b is now available at

code capable of encryption or decryption. Steve combined those with
source for 1.4a, already available overseas.
Steve compiled the new source code, and sent the new EXE files to me.
I compared the new executables to ones I compiled myself and verified
they match, bit for bit.  I then sent back to Steve detached signature
files for the executables.  Steve then put together secdr14b.zip and
sent that to me for final inspection.  I then compared all files
against my "master" files here and verified that they matched. I then
shipped the secdr14b.zip that Steve sent me to the USA sites. So the
USA release matches bit for bit the offshore release.
Here are the contents of secdr14b.zip

Bruce Baugh recently posted,
    *Has there been any news recently about what's going on with
    commercial versions of PGP?  I've been toying with the idea of
    buying the Windows version from ViaCrypt just to have a PGP that
    doesn't need to shell out to DOS each time it runs, but I'm
    curious as to where, if anywhere, things seem to be going.
First, unless there's been a new release, the so-called Windows
version of ViaCrypt is just a Windows shell that still creates a DOS
window to run PGP. It's a pretty good shell, and it's easy to install,
but that's about it.
There was a big discussion recently on alt.security.pgp about PRZ and
ViaCrypt.  Apparently Phil now wants to produce his own commercial
version of PGP and has "requested" ViaCrypt to sell back the
commercial rights under threat of a lawsuit if they don't.
Phil disagrees with ViaCrypts new "business" version of PGP which
apparently encrypts all messages with an employer-supplied public key
in addition to any specified by the employee.  ViaCrypt has their side
of the argument on their web page.
   The basis of the possible lawsuit would be that ViaCrypt violated
their agreement not to put any "back door" into any product with the
PGP name. Whether the "business version feature" could be defined as a
"back door" would be the crux of the argument.

    Looking at Denning's critique (pro-escrow rant) of the NCR crypto
    report, she mentioned that mutant version:
    [
      "Other corporations are similarly adopting products with data recovery
      capabilities as they integrate encryption into their systems (even PGP
      comes with data recovery in Viacrypt's Business Edition)."
    IMHO Phil Zimmerman has good reason to object to the mutant
    version, if it's going to cause the PGP name to somehow endorse
    escrow.
Denning is being disengenuous (so what's new). There's a big
difference between voluntary, not-government-sponsored "escrow" like
the type in the "business version" of ViaCrypt, and what Denning and
her friends in the government TLA's want.
Seems to me an employer has a perfect right to monitor his employee's
work product, for which he's being paid a salary and using the
employer's equipment (like business PGP).  If the employee doesn't
like it, he's free to seek employment elsewhere (or start his own
business).  Or he's free to encrypt all his personal Email at home
with a personal copy of ViaCrypt or a copy of free PGP.

I would like people to send me (pointers to) reference information on
how to write WinSock-compliant client software.  Also tools required,
hopefully free/shareware ones.  The particular application of interest
is a "web-crawler" which can log certain information in web pages it
If such reference information is not available or forthcoming, but
there are people reading this who nevertheless know how to write such
software, they are invited to contact me about contracting to write
such an application for a negotiable payment.
Please respond by Email, as I only subscribe to a digest of the
Cypherpunks list.

INTERNET SUPPRESSION IN BURMA
In an attack on the country's political dissidents, the military regime in
Burma has outlawed the unauthorized possession of a computer with networking
capability, and prison terms of 7 to 15 years in prison may be imposed on
those who evade the law or who are found guilty of using a computer to send
or receive information on such topics as state security, the economy and
national culture.  (Financial Times 5 Oct 96)

- From a quick perusal of the above web site, it appears as though
F-Secure Desktop offers encryption by file, much like PGP does, only a
little more automatic.  But an entire encrypted file must be decrypted
before you can process it and the entire file must then be
re-encrypted if it is updated.
- From     With the built-in AutoSecure(TM) feature, you can define sets of
    files, directories, and Windows 95 folders that will be
    automatically encrypted and decrypted every time you start or
    close Windows.
- From this, it appears encrypted files are decrypted while windows is
open. Obviously if Windows crashes a lot of plaintext files can be
left lying around!
I prefer the methods of SecureDrive
  or Secure Device
  ftp://utopia.hacktic.nl/pub/replay/pub/disk/secdev14.arj
in which data is decrypted "on-the-fly" as it is transferred from
disk to memory.  The data is -always- encrypted on the disk. Both of
the above use strong IDEA encryption (same as PGP) and both are
free for non-commercial use. (Commercial use is possible by paying a
small royalty to the holders of the IDEA patent; see
  In contrast, F-Secure Desktop is $99 a copy.
