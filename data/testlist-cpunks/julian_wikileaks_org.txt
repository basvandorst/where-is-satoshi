@_subject: WikiLeaks inspired "New media haven" proposal passes Parliament 
Reykjavik, Iceland; 4:00 UTC, June 16th 2010.
The WikiLeaks advised proposal to build an international
"new media haven" in Iceland, with the world's strongest
press and whistleblower protection laws, and a "Nobel" prize for for Freedom of Expression, has unaminously passed the
Icelandic Parliament.
50 votes were cast in favor, zero against, one abstained. Twelve
members of parliament were not present. Vote results are available
at One of the inspirations for the proposal was the dramatic August 2009 gagging of
of Iceland's national broadcaster, RUV by Iceland's then largest bank, Kaupthing:
Two changes were made to the proposal from its original form as per
the opinion of the parliament's general affairs committee
[ The first of these
altered slightly the wording of the first paragraph so as to widen
the arena for research. The second of these added two new items to
the list of tasks for the government:
   - That the government should perform a detailed analysis,
     especially with respect to operational security,
     for the prospect of operating data centers in Iceland.
   - That the government should organize an international conference
     in Iceland regarding the changes to the legal environment being caused
     by expansion of cloud computing, data havens, and the judicial state
     of the Internet.
