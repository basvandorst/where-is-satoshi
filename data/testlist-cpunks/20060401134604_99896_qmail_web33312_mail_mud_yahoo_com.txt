I am so sick of April Fool's day.  It used to be that only simple,
verbal statements were possible jokes.  Now the entire day is wasted,
turned into a farce.  Everything I read is suspect, even physical books.
This, OTOH, is half-true.  It appears the fraudster was selected into
the China Int'l Police Exhibition without a working model.
