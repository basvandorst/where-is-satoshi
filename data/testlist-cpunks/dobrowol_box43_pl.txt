I am interested in Blum-Blum-Shub and Micali-Schnorr random bits generators. ( just for educational propose ) I wonder if You have got ready working, implemented in C programs( or just anything about this topic). If yes, could You please send me by e-mail, it would be really helpful for me. Sorry  for disturbing :)
Best regards !!!
