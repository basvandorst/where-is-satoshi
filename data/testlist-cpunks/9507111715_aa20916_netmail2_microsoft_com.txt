@_subject: Speedup of bruterc4.c 
For linux boxes (or perhaps 486 and pentium machines in general), try
adding the flag -funroll-all-loops to the compile line.
    gcc -O2 -funroll-all-loops -m486 -o brute bruterc4.c
Here are my results on a Linux 486/33
Original code (Adam+Tatu)                               : 5405 keys/sec
Original code with -funroll-all-loops                   : 5991 keys/sec
Original code with Russell's changes                and a couple of my own and -funroll-all-loops           : 6393 keys/sec
Here are the changes I made:
If we assume that the length of the cyphertext and known text is less
than 256 bytes, then the following works.  This gives you a whopping 40
additional keys/sec.
