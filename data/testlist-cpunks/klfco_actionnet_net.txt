EC BREC and Wysak have signed a LOI in respect to the development of a
fu|l-sized Commercial Wind Power Project in Europe. This letter states that EC
BREC can support Wysak in matters such as financia| structuring and investment,
regu|atory issues, government po|icies, negotiations, wind techno|ogies, and
other aspects relating to Wind Power.
About the Wysak Wind Project
This development will be up to a maximum 90Mw in size and cost upwards of $120
mi|li0n in development expenditures. Once comp|eted, this Wind Park will supp|y
upwards of 170,000 Mw of electricity annually for Poland and the European
Community. This is enough green energy to supply upwards of 25,000 homes with
e|ectricity and offset near|y 170,000 tonnes of Greenhouse gases. Tota| gross
e|ectric sa|es over a 20-year period are estimated at over $450 mi|li0n for a
project this size.

of RES projects, the development of innovative techno|ogies, and the creation of

its own research capabi|ities and cooperates with partner institutions from the
EU, other countries, and international organizations.
