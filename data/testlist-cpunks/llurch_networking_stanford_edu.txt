A separate password file is kept for each "user" in:
  C:\WINDOWS\*.PWL
.PWL files are weakly encrypted with the "default login" password. Once you decrypt them, they contain cleartext passwords for every other password-protected resource accessed by that user (network servers, screen savers, dial-up networking, possibly .PWL-enabled encryption Somebody supposedly posted code for decrypting .PWL files to sci.crypt.
.PWL files are persistent, i.e., Joe "logs on," saves a couple passwords, "logs off," then Judy comes by, hits Escape or various other trivial tricks to avoid the need to "log on," picks up Joe's .PWL file, and cracks it at her leisure.
Each "user" also gets an unencrypted "profile" that gives all application
preferences. Anyone who treats Win95 as if it were a multiuser system is an idiot.

Very interesting.
Do you have information on the content of the various resource records
within a .PWL file? They should be the stored usernames and passwords for
every other authenticated service used by the "user profile."
I.e. the "default login," say, the local Windows password, encrypts the
.PWL file, and the contents are the passwords used for NetWare, NT,
Dial-Up Networking, the screen saver, .PWL-enabled "security" utilities,
If anyone wants a sample .PWL file including known values of all of the above, I can have it for you within a day. Of course I wouldn't want to give you any *real* passwords.
Of course I should just compile your code myself, but it's a busy day, and I'd hate to unnecessarily duplicate someone else's work...

I do believe the word "lame" is in order, yes.
Microsoft has issued a public statement on the "issue" at As usual, the inaccuracies begin with the first sentence. Password caching
is not optional. It is on by default. Instructions for turning it off are
not even included with the floppy disk or OEM versions of Win95, and
they're not easy to find in the Resource Kit help file on the install CD,
which is neither installed nor referenced by default. Some rather astute people spent days looking for a way to disable password caching, and they couldn't find it. Their messages are on my list archive.
There is currently *no way* for the administrator of a public Windows 95 lab to have any confidence that password caching has been turned off. All it takes is one malicious user -- or one innocent user who wants to disable system policies for other reasons -- and all passwords used from that machine are compromised.

 (below)? It says "The password encryption method used by Windows NT is different from
the method used by Windows 95," and offers some curious workarounds.
Microsoft has not been very cooperative. In other news (just to combine four subjects in one message), in our
meeting with Microsoft today on DHCP issues (that's in the gopher archive;
finger me), a Highly Placed Source said that Microsoft would release the
details on the new Win95 .PWL encryption Soon, and that a release
candidate is in internal beta testing now, but that there would be no
outside testing prior to the public release. You may not be able to connect to a shared folder on a Windows 95 computer
from a Microsoft Windows NT workstation.
The password encryption method used by Windows NT is different from
the method used by Windows 95.
You may be able to work around this problem by using one of the following
 - Use all uppercase or all lowercase characters in the Windows 95
   shared folder password.
 - Remove password protection from the shared folder.
 - Use user-level access control instead of share-level access control.
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

@_subject: EXON 
A nucleic acid chain (RNA or DNA) is composed of exons, which are "active" sequences of nucleotides that are expressed as polypeptides, and "introns," what is known as "junk DNA." Only about 2% of the 6 billion or so base pairs that make up the human genome are exons.
(There is some controversy in molecular biology circles as to whether "junk DNA" is really "junk" just because it doesn't build proteins. It could perform a regulatory or "frame-check" function.)
In cryptographic applications, the sequence of nucleotides can only be considered random inasmuch as the ratio of exon to intron is unknown.
Hence the inside joke. You see?
There is also a United States Senator James Exon, D-Nebraska I believe, who has introduced several restrictive and silly pieces of legistlation concerning online privacy rights. "The Exon Bill" claims to hold individuals
and online service providers liable for the transmission of undefined "inappropriate" material, such as pornography.
So maybe that's what you've heard people talking about.

While Leahy, the medical privacy bill's chief sponsor, is generally regarded as a White Hat (he led the opposition to Exon), I do have serious concerns about the issues that have been raised. I'm aware of the CDT's break with the EFF and have questioned their "maturity" before. It's possible they were "co-opted" or naive.
But at least the CDT cites its sources (like the full text of the bill and

The update comes with no ReadMe -- it's a self-contained installer only.

other modifications. I will not recommend or distribute this archive to

The correct name for this page and patch is "Updated Drivers for Windows
95 File and Printer Sharing Security Issue." WinNews gave no indication
what this patch did. A "WinNews Special Issue" with some details on the SMB bug (including
incorrect information that has been quietly corrected, but not retracted
on WinNews or elsewhere) was sent to at least some WinNews subscribers in
late October. This "Special Issue" is not archived on Microsoft's Web

they would be made available "within two weeks," there are still no
international versions of the SMB or C$ security patches available on
Microsoft's Web site. All non-English copies of Win95 are still
vulnerable. Most of the major PC magazines are going to carry something on the SMB and .PWL bugs next month. Windows Magazine's story is going to be unambiguously positive:
  In response to a posting on the Internet questioning the security of
  Windows 95's optional password caching feature, Microsoft immediately   recommended that concerned users turn off password caching. Microsoft

wiretap capacity. Urge the FBI to follow the current measurement of
wiretapping, as reported annually by the Administrative Office of the U.S.
Courts, which considers the actual number of wiretaps authorized. If you
are a telephone customer, ask the FBI to address the privacy risks of
unauthorized, illegal, or excessive wire surveillance. Comments should be
submitted in triplicate to the Telecommunications Industry Liaison Unit

I can only hope you're joking, but based on your last article, I'm not so
sure. That was intended as a small joke for anyone using PGP; see the
X-PGP-Key header in the original message. You really should have talked to Steve Pizzo before bastardizing his

reasons stated, which is why I assumed you were talking about something
else. Again, Spotlight being vague about evidence that doesn't really
support their points. The case is C.A. No. 94-1720 (CRR) in D.C.  You can

@_subject: Telephone switch capacity -Reply 
[about the FBI supposedly wanting the ability to tap 1% of all phones in the US simultaneously]
EPIC, CDT, and the original source confirm that they're talking about
capacity, not total circuits. So what the FBI was asking for (not
demanding, certainly not dicatating) by early 1999 (not Oct 1998, because
the ticker starts at the end of the comment period) was between 0.25% and
1% of the 10-20% of lines that the phone system can handle at once, or
between 0.025% and 0.2% of the lines. Of course the FBI doesn't have the staff to listen to all these lines, and
they need an individual court order to authorize each individual
interception, so this numbers game is a bit of a joke. There is no controversy about the number of wiretaps that have been
authorized, except as manufactured by the Spotlight folks and other
conspiracy loons. The EPIC FOIA request and lawsuit concerns the rationale
for the FBI's capacity request. It all makes a little more sense now. I had been wondering what the hell
the FBI had been smoking. Something not quite as strong as the stuff the
Spotlight people are smoking, it turns out. The FBI proposal is still Not A Good Thing, and deserves your interest and opposition. See  for facts and reasonable responses. The CDT's page, at  is better.

@_subject: [ID point semi-off-topic] Re: using PGP only for digital signatures 
All true.
A green card, by itself, also fails to prove legal status.
Proving legal residency requires a combination of two documents, one each
from specified lists. Most commonly a driver's license, green card (which
is actually pink), or birth certificate from list A, and a social
security card from list B. Chris Hibbert's SSN FAQ talks a little bit about how this works, and why
it's a Good Thing. Basically, for privacy and security reasons, it is a
very good idea to separate the issues of identity and authorization.
I don't care how securely you can authenticate who I am -- by PGP, retinal
scan, whatever. I do not want a single digitizable token to be the key to
my identity. Even if that identity cannot be forged (and everything can be
forged), it can be used to track me, by the government, by the Direct
Marketing Association, by the private investigators of certain wacky
cults, and by TRW. And I suppose by those secret government types at SAIC
who, we are told, control the Internet now :-)
It is a little inconvenient, but this is why it's a Good Thing that you
need a separate driver's license, social security card, credit card, phone
number, PGP key, password, thumbprint, and retina. I would oppose moves to
combine them to a single unified "mark of the beast," as it were. I am a
little uneasy about the otherwise very cool First Bank of the Internet for
this reason. If you use FBOI, I'd recommend using a PGP key separate from your usual PGP key.
Crypto fans need to recognize that the ability to securely prove your identity is not an unmitigated advance.
Of course, all the crypto fans here are also pseudonym fans.
This is a job for private key cryptography, like kerberos.

@_subject: Credentials Without Identity 
Thanks for the newbie correction.
In case anyone else is new to this, I couldn't find that paper, but Chaum's
ideas and references are at True. But until digital technology becomes ubiquitous, we're stuck with
it, and it does help. I see no analog, well, analog to credential technology. It absolutely requires machines that can generate and handle large random numbers. Right?
My point was, even people who should know better, like the managers and
clients of FBOI (fboi at netcom.com), are relying on security through appeal
to irrelevant crypto authority, which is even worse. Using your primary
pgp key as a traceable link to your credit card number or bank account can
be just as bad as publishing your credit card number. I haven't yet fully digested this concept, but don't you get into a bit of
a chicken-and-egg problem when you start applying this to things like
proof of age and citizenship? Until you reach a certain age, you're not
going to remember your passphrase. I still think there's a role for
private keys held by some authority (I realize that's not a popular word). I'd guess this would be addressed by a "secret sharer"/secsplit kind of
thing, where your parents hold a combination of keys that together can
represent your secret key until you're old enough to change it yourself. Still I'd worry about what kind of information was gathered about me in my
youth, and how that might be carried over into maturity.

Such a thing could exist, because Win95 allows you to save passwords that
use different encryption methods. Microsoft would say "no, doesn't exist,"
however, because this is a major security flaw. I haven't seen such a
tool, though. Anybody?
What you should do is get a real encryption package like PGP (poke
around on  or  it's
free), use something that is long and complicated but that you will never
ever forget as your PGP passphrase, and encrypt a text file containing
all of your passwords with PGP. You can put other stuff like all your

The list of spammed addresses is yours if you can verify who you are and
tell me what you're going to do with it. A malicious attack might be justifiable in extreme cases. For example, because of some really, really stupid Web and mail server design flaws, it would have trivial for me to have erased the entire hard drives of all of the machines at valleynet.net. But I figured picking up his password file and telling all of his customers what I thought of him would be almost as effective while retainng the moral high ground.

The answer, for anyone desiring one, is to turn off Win95's "multiple user profiles" features, turn off "encrypted password caching," and advertise the fact that Win95 is a totally insecure single-user OS, and will continue to be so as long as it uses the 1970's-vintage FAT file system. If real security is not available, the goal should be to eliminate the false sense of security that encourages people to leave sensitive files out in the open.

In article <461u88$luk at dingo.cc.uq.oz.au> in a few newsgroups, Lots of things are new, and very interesting, especially for Usenet readers, because the story involves forged cancels, apparently stolen passwords, and serious computer crime. I'm so glad you asked.
Unsurprising Fact: Microsoft has finally acknowledged and documented the
problem, and, without fanfare, released a patch for Windows for Workgroups
that claims to fix it. Fact: several people at Microsoft have been lying about the problem. In
early September, paulbal at microsoft.com assured a gathering of Stanford
computing support staff that the problem had been fixed in build 490, so I
looked no further into it. For a while.
Fact: On September 27, I reposted a July article from the SAMBA email list archive about the bug you know all about. I asked for confirmation on whether it had been fixed in the release version of Win95, and whether a fix was available for WFW.
Supposition: Early morning September 28, my kerberos password was
apparently hacked, and my .forward file was disabled on several UNIX
machines, preventing me from receiving some personal and work-related
email. I did not notice this problem until October 6 because I seldom log
on to the machines in question. Fact: On September 28, I received several replies to my post, several
saying that Microsoft had assured them that it had been fixed at some
specified (often specified different) build. I also received two replies
that the problem had *not* been fixed, and volunteering to reproduce the
problem for me. Fact: I posted the confirmation of the bug to win95netbugs at lists.stanford.edu.
Fact: The Windows for Workgroups security bug fix patch on Microsoft's FTP server is dated late night September 28.
Fact: On October 2, Paul_Krill at InfoWorld.Com phoned and emailed me
inquiring about the problem. He had also been assured by Microsoft sources
that the problem had been fixed. I forwarded several articles his way
indicating that it had not been fixed. I again searched the Microsoft
Knowledge Base for any mention of "SAMBA" or "SMBCLIENT" and found none. Fact: On October 4, received an email message from henrysa at microsoft.com
inquiring about the problem and offering to investigate for me the current
status of the problem. In reply, I sent him the three email messages that
are included at the bottom of this post. I have not received any sort of
reply from Henry. Fact/Supposition: October 2 (?), somebody made a directory on a Stanford
FTP server world-readable and world-writeable, uploaded several megabytes
of "warez," and advertised the site on hacker BBSes. Since many people had
access to this directory, there were no suspicions about who was
responsible. My kerberos password, which I now believe was stolen, would
have been sufficient to cause this problem. Fact: Late night/early morning October 14-15, in a routine browse of the
Microsoft Knowledge Base, I came across articles on the SMB security bugs,
which we all know about now. I posted them, with commentary rather less lurid than what you have seen from me since, when I was perturbed. Fact: The article was canceled. On this day 10/18/95, under penalty of
perjury, I swear that it was not canceled by me. My PGP signature should be legally binding.
Fact: I also Cc'd the article to \win95netbugs and myself via email. The email made it. NewsWatcher works such that separate Message-IDs are created for news and email, and someone reading the news post has no way of knowing whether the article was also emailed.
Supposition: the canceler did not know that NewsWatcher worked this way.
Fact: In the morning, I noticed the article was missing, but that earlier and later articles by me were there. I figured something must have gone wrong, so I reposted it.
Fact: From 12:10 to 5PM, I was with Kevin Morris at Sacred Heart school in
Atherton, building a local PhoneNET network. Obviously, I had no Internet
access. While I was there, my second post of the article was canceled.
Fact: Around 7PM, I noticed the second cancel, and a followup thereto from
a netcom account confirming that the article had been posted and
propagated, got really pissed off, and posted it a third time. I also
posted to news.admin.net-abuse.misc and our local news administration group. I also Cc'd several PC and networking magazines via email, and cross-posted to a .test group so that I would have verification of the propagation of the article in hand.
Fact: Today, as was the case 15 hours after it was posted, article
, to which there was
that netcom followup, is missing, presumed canceled, from the core
Stanford news servers nntp and csd-newshost. It is present on the
secondary news host morrow.stanford.edu, and on external sites. No one has been able to provide any explanation for this.

Prescript: No, I am not affiliated with any government agency in any way.
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
A government agency is looking for something to ensure that files copied
from a Windows 95 machine do not contain any data from unused space on the
hard drive. I'm curious too.
Perhaps a command.com hack that zeroes out any bits outside the actual
file? The problem is that existing utilities do not work because Win95
disables direct disk access to preserve VFAT. A delete utility is not
sufficient, because they are also worried about temporary files created by
Win95 programs. - -rich

This is incorrect. The acknowledgement of the bug, which was pointed out

definitions of probable cause. Section 10 of Proposition 187, which was passed by the ever-so-enlightened
people of California last November, empowers the police to incarcerate
without charge anyone who can not produce the two forms of identification
required to prove legal residence. Fortunately, 187 is so Unconstitutional
on its face that multiple injunctions against the enforcement of every one
of provisions were ordered within 30 minutes of 187's receiving the
Governor's signature. Today, many jurisdictions in California prohibit state & local officials
from turning people over to the INS. It's not good for public health and
safety for the alleged illegal people to be afraid to call the cops, or a

This raises some interesting questions about the power of private data
collection and data havens, though. There is something to be said for the

always be "infiltrated" by professional bureaucrats who care about human

likely to open their affairs to public scrutiny.

had corrected the language that Senator Exon introduced to comport with
the first amendment, I still hear in my State, and I hear of people
writing about how so and so is promoting pornography on the Internet
because they will not ban pornography on the Internet.
Yet, in the bill, we came along--all of us here--and the genesis of this
came from Senator Feinstein, when it was initially offered. The majority
leader, Senator Hatch, and I had some concerns with this, and we thought
the language to ban teaching people how to make bombs on the Internet or
engage in terrorist activities on the Internet might violate the first
amendment. Senators Dole, Hatch, and I worked to tighten the language and
came up with language that was tough and true to civil liberties. It was
accepted by unanimous consent.
We have all heard about the bone-chilling information making its way over
the Internet, about explicit instructions about how to detonate pipe bombs
and even, if you can believe it, baby food bombs. Senator Feinstein quoted
an Internet posting that detailed how to build and explode one of these
things, which concludes that `If the explosion don't get'em, the glass
will. If the glass don't get'em, the nails will.'
I would like to give you a couple of illustrations of the kinds of things
that come across the Internet. This is one I have in my hand which was

Now for the hard part. You must cut open the plastic housing of the bullet

or not.
Then there is a diagram, which is shown as to how to do that on the
Internet. Then it says:
You must not make the cut directly where the gun powder is, or it will
explode. You cut it where the pellets are.
And then it goes through this in detail. And then it gets to the end, and
it says:
Did I mention that this is also highly illegal? Unimportant stuff that is
cool to know.
And then it rates shotgun shells by two numbers, gauge, pellet size, and
goes into great detail. It is like building an erector set. It does it in

 Also note that this speech concerns an amendment to S735 that FAILED.
I.e., the language for which the esteemed [snort] Mr. Biden is arguing IS
NOT IN THE BILL AS PASSED BY THE SENATE.
Mr. Biden's next sentence, which either Mr. Thompson or the anonymous
forwarder conveniently left out, is "But that is just not the way it
works." It should come as no surprise to anyone on the cypherpunks that
such things are technically possible. But do they happen? Does even our
friend Senator Joe "You Heard It Here First" Biden approve? Mr. Biden's
speech continues, also conveniently left out by Mr. Thompson and the
anonymous forwarder:
 That necessity requirement is meant to ensure that wiretapping is not the
 normal investigative technique, like physical surveillance or the use of
 informants. These are very serious protections, Mr. President. I believe
 that interposing a court between the prosecutor and the wiretap is a
 citizens' best protection.
 But even before we get to the judge who makes his decision, there is a
 very painstaking, stringent process within the Justice Department for
 determining when to seek a court authorization for a wiretap.
 First, the agent in the field, under the supervision of his or her
 supervisor, must write an affidavit, a sworn affidavit, that they must
 sign that sets out all the particular facts relating to probable  cause,
 because even if an order is granted based on the agent, if he is lying,
 then that information is gone even if the judge issued the wiretap
 order.
 This is painstaking. It is time consuming, as well it should be, for we
 want to make sure that wiretaps are used in only the most serious cases.
 We want to make sure that they are used only as a last resort when all
 other less intrusive techniques have failed, and we want to make sure
 that the Government is not making unwarranted intrusions into our
 privacy. But we also need to make sure that law enforcement has the
 tools, if they meet all these hurdles, to catch the bad guy.
 You cannot get a wiretap, even if you do all the things I just said,
 unless you turn to the Criminal Code, and you have all these crimes
 listed in the Criminal Code. OK. You may find a crime in one section, and
 then you have to turn to another section, section 251, of the Criminal
 Code entitled, `Authorization for Interception of Wire, Oral or
 Electronic Communications.' And then you have to find there in subsection
 (c) the list of offenses for which you can get a wiretap.  Not every
 crime is entitled to have a wiretap attached to it.
So there we are. The next speech is by Orrin Hatch, who doesn't really
address any of Biden's points, but that's OK, because I don't agree with
Oh yeah, and Biden read the full text of the "Attention All Unabomber
Wannabes" and "Babyfood Bombs" documents into the Congressional Record,
supposedly to underscore the point that those nasty Republicans are
endorsing such nasty nasty stuff. Sort of like Exon's little blue book.

Why should they? They've already made up their minds.
Where? He says:
"We need to keep in mind that the obscene or threatening phone caller has
neither his privacy nor his speech protected when he threatens a member of
the community via phone - why are those protections afforded if he
launches the same attack via the Internet?" I think Rabbi Heir is aware of the legal definitions of "obscene" and
"threatening." Assuming we agree on those definitions, I agree with the
above language. For example, I've received quite a lot of anonymous email
and phone calls that are threatening by the colloquial definition, but
which do not meet the legal definition of threatening or obscene attacks. I am personally interested in tracking these folks down, but I know better
than to try to make it a legal issue, and if I do succeed in tracking them
down, all that will be used against them is speech. On the other hand, if someone makes a clear and specific bomb threat
through an anonymous remailer, then I would hope that attempts would be
made to track him down. I would also hope that tracking him down would be
extremely difficult and resource-intensive, and that the remailer
operators would not actively help the trackers, because I strongly support
the anonymity option when it is used nonviolently -- even and especially
by people with whom I disagree. I feel I can have a much better
conversation with an enemy if he knows that his talking to me doesn't make
it easier for me to put a gun to his head. Openness is good.
In such cases, I usually find it helpful to ask. Bcc'd to a couple of
affiliates in the hopes that they'll clarify. I seriously doubt that they
have any clue what Government Access to Keys means, though. My take is that Rabbie Hier is around the center of the SWC leadership.
Rabbi Cooper is more likely to support censorship; Eaton is much less;
Mark Weitzman is also in the center (of the SWC, not of the mainstream
Jewish/anti-"revisionist" community, which is very supportive of free
speech). On January 29th, the SF Chronicle (and probably other papers)
carried this piece from Weitzman:
 In light of the fact that Michael Loomis's Zundelmirror continues to make
the charge that the Simon Wiesenthal Center was in favor of censoring
Zundel, a charge that not even Zundel has made, it's worth highlighting
 "The recent decision made by the German government to block certain
 providers was made without any participation by the Center. We have never
 requested either the German government or Deutsche Telekom to take such
 drastic steps. To assume that we have the power to control the German
 government is to renew the myth of International Jewry pulling the
 strings of various governments. The reality is that the German
 government, as a legally constituted government of a recognized
 democracy, has every right to create its own laws. As long as those laws,
 and their method of adoption, fall into the generally accepted range
 associated with democracies, then any attempt by foreigners to alter
 those laws is an intrusion and smacks of cultural imperialism.... To
 disagree with the German government (as the Center does on the arbitrary
 nature of the actions by Deutsche Telekom and Compuserve - we believe
 that laws should be applied only to those breaking the law, not to entire
 systems) and to inform the German government of such disagreement, as we
 have done, is quite different from attempts to break the law by aiding
 Nazi propagandists under the banner of free speech." Of course, I disagree. I think it's vitally important to help Nazi
propagandists under the banner of free speech. As long as that's what
you're doing.

acknowledged errors on you web pages, so why should I waste my time
pointing them out?
Since we all agree that the SWC is in the wrong, we need something to talk
about. Let's just agree up front that the size of your dick is
proportional to the fervor of your denunciation of the Simon Wiesenthal
Center, facts notwithstanding. So far, I believe Tim wins because he
called them "Jew Nazis," but keep working at it. Maybe if you're lucky,
you'll earn the George Orwell Free Speech Award:  Sure, why not. It's probably true that they'll try. Being a bunch of
idealogues, I don't imagine that they'll realize, as Sameer points out,
that *they* are considered an anti-government group. Morris Dees is certainly not the only person to speak of this influence.
Try Terry Nichols and McVeigh's sister.
Said book being The Turner Diaries, which, like the Goebbels book that
your web page says is "banned," is being published without censorship. It
tells the story of The Order, a white supremacist group that overthrows
the US government through random acts of terror and violence against
political, cultural, and economic targets. There happens to have been a
real terrorist organization that called itself The Order, led by a bunch
of National Alliance members. You may have heard of Bob Mathews.  Now The
Order has resurfaced in Spokane Valley; some bombings and bank robberies
went down in early April, to some applause on the Neo-Nazi lists. The Turner Diaries has always been available through the National Alliance
Neo-Nazi criminal organization, whose leader wrote it.  If you want to
read this book, I will personally send you a copy of the National Alliance
edition. The Turner Diaries is now going to be published by the more mainstream
Barricade Books as well. Good for them. I really don't like the idea of
sending the National Alliance any more money.
There was a flurry of controversy about the new edition, to which the
publisher, Lyle Stewart, responded in, of all places, Liz Smith's widely
syndicated "Grapevine" column, thusly:   "I couldn't help recall a similar controversy that raged when a major
American publishing house issued Adolf Hitler's 'Mein Kampf.' Should such
a book be published? To me the answer was self-evident. Of course, it
should have been. People should be able to read and understand what
Hitler was about.
  "By the same reasoning, I believe most people think militias and related
groups like the Freemen are fun-loving, beer-drinking gun fanatics who
like to shoot rabbits and deer. Not so. They hate democracy. They hate our
government and all officials who represent it. They practice racism and
terrorism. Is this something that only the Drug Enforcement Agency and the
FBI and CIA should know, or do you have a right to know and understand it,

I agree that the major innovation, and cypherpunk opportunity, of Java is
in its cross-platform nature, not its vaunted ability to run untrusted

that Java is going to live up to the hype. It is still not clear to me
that Microsoft is going to support it seriously in their browser, which by
mid-1997 will be so tightly integrated with the lowest-common-denominator
operating system that there will be no room for Netscape.
NT scares me, too. Even major universities with huge investments in UNIX,
kerberos, and AFS are flirting with NT. I believe they're fucking nuts,
but they're doing it. I think it's prudent to hold your nose and accept that Visual Basic is
here to stay. Microsoft isn't going to let Java fulfill its promises.
If you're talking *mind*share, it's all Java. All the best minds are
working on it. But if you're talking *market* share, like what people
spend money on, and get money for, it's VB.
I'm not saying that Microsoft is going to take over the world. We're going
to have a balkanized computing world for some time. But Microsoft can and
will prevent Java from subverting their share of the world.
Has Microsoft even licensed Java, or are they still at the vague December

I assume that Declan is just observing how Safesurf operates. My view is
that these private "decency" registries are a healthy part of the free
market. Of course the "Angels" are a bunch of hypocrites, but the part
about rating sites I support. Let the prudes censor themselves; it's a
free net.  If anyone tries to sabotage Safesurf by rating things the
"wrong" way, then they're an asshole. (I am *not* accusing Declan of
advocating this, because he isn't -- it's just something that crossed my
mind. Tempting, but highly counterproductive.)
APPEAL FOR VOLUNTEERS
Hi again everyone.  I have a project that requires 20 volunteers.  Read on!
Most of you I hope are familiar with Safesurf - if not go visit them at
Safesurf are not a commercial software company but are a kidsafe
organization who are very involved in the ratings issue for kids and adult
material on the Net.  Safesurf are also our allies, and it is thanks to
them that we have our website at all as it was a donation from Ray and
Wendy at Safesurf.
Safesurf have a very positive approach to the screening debate - they have
developed a rating system whereby instead of spending time rating adult
sites you focus instead on rating the kids sites.  Then your screening
software only allows you to visit sites with the Safesurf rating on it.
This is an excellent concept, not least because it doesn't then matter if
new sites come onto the web that are not rated yet, because nothing can be
included in your screened browser unless it registers itself as kidsafe by
marking its site with a safesurf rating mark.  Don't worry about my
ramblings - just go to their site and read up on it.  It's a really
positive concept and has been adopted by a lot of sites already.  Adopting
the Safesurf mark is voluntary and means that you are identifying your site
as suitable for e.g. kids.
Now here comes the appeal.  Several thousand sites have already marked
themselves as Safesurf rated - and more are registering every day.
The question is - what is to stop a site registering as a kidsafe site, but
in reality being an adult site?  The Safesurf rating method is that sites
can obtain the rating from the Safesurf site and then write in and register
themselves.  Isn't it possible that a site could claim to be kidsafe but in
reality was adult?
The answer is yes.  So how can Safesurf be sure that sites registered with
them are indeed genuinely kidsafe?  Simple - someone has to go and check
out all the sites who register with Safesurf.
Ray had a proposal for me.  How about if we could say that all these sites
were "Rated by Safesurf, and patrolled by CyberAngels"?  I thought that was
a great idea - for we CyberAngels to help Safesurf in this way, by checking
their sites for them.
Ray is proposing to send me 200 sites a week to check out and we will share
them out to a CyberAngels team of 20 volunteers - that means that each one
of us would volunteer to check out 10 sites per week.  Easy right?
I want to make something very clear - Safesurf are not a rich commercial
company making money from rating sites.  They are not selling software and
their rating code is free to anyone who wants it.  So it's not like they
can hire 20 people and pay them to patrol the Safesurf Intranet - it's a
volunteer job.
So there you are - I am looking for 20 CyberAngel volunteers to make up a
regular Safesurf "Intranet" Patrol, with the mission to visit 10 URLs a
week and make sure that they are what they say they are.  Who's ready?
Once I have the team established I will then brief you all on how we do
this.  Write to me as soon as possible if this interests you.  Let's show
Safesurf how much we support their positive stand for our InterNet kids!  I
will take the first 20 volunteers who contact me (yes you will be suitably
honored - publicly if you so choose!)

That might be one view, but not mine. I think people who evade income
taxes are bad -- they're stealing from the rest of society. But I believe
that the growth of cryptoanarchy means that people who make far more money
than we do can evade taxes with ever greater ease. The current system puts
honest people at a disadvantage, which is never a good thing. The
technical and economic analyses presented here are neither good or bad --
they're true or false. I tend to believe that they are more true than
false. My semi-conclusion is that in a knowledge and services society like ours,
a fair share of income tax cannot be collected from the very rich without
imposing totalitarian controls; therefore, government needs to be more
entrepreneurial, cut costs, divide labor, and raise revenue through
somewhate harder-to-evade sales, real estate, and inheritance taxes. Such

That's not what he wrote. He meant fair TAXIation. Michael is criticizing
arbitrary government regulations on transportation systems. See part four
of Hernando de Soto's _The Other Path_ and other publications from
Instituto Libertad y Democracia (Lima, Peru). The original Spanish version
is more complete, with a statistical appendix, but the US paperback
edition, ISBN 0-06-091640-0, hits all the main points.
The issue of taxis that lack government license has also been raised in
New York City and San Franciso in recent years. Might also be in Gabriel
Zaid's La Economia presidencial, but it's been a while since I read that,
and I don't own a copy.
Cypherpunk relevance? In theory at least, the "medallions" that identify
legal taxis are a form of Chaum's credentials without identity.
Loomis is in your "cypherpunks-people-to-read-file" because of the
ZundeLooMirror. He's a good guy, if a bit abrasive. Unfortunately, I found
out too late that the best way to get him to do something stupid and
wrong is to tell him that it's stupid and wrong. That makes you an enemy,
and not worth listening to.
By the way, I think I know what you mean, but someone unfamiliar with
cypherpunks or you might read this indication that you have a "people to

way. You're liable to be called a FUCKING CLOSED-MINDED CENSOR NAZI.

I'm glad *somebody* realized that. I believe there have been at least a
half dozen messages Cc'd to nobody in the last couple days. [everything of "substance" deleted]
Based on other discussions we've had, I believe I've sent Nobody the FAQ
for the alpha.c2.org remailer. Another, minimum alternative would be to
post anonymous messages with a PGP signature. This would at least answer
the questions of whether the Mr. Nobody that posted the Iron Mountain
hoax is the same Mr. Nobody who spews about Dresden. If Nobody needs help getting an alpha.c2.org account to work, and he
doesn't trust anybody here, then I recommend whitewolf at alpha.c2.org, an
avowed National Socialist who 1) will not betray Nobody's trust and 2) is
not subject to surveilance, because all messages to him will arrive
PGP-encrypted, to be read offline.
Another Nazi who seems to know a lot about how alpha.c2.org works, because
he traced my friend Erin's nym back with a traffic-analysis spam, is
ralphj at eskimo.com. I would recommend "Dave Harmon," but he had his netcom
account yanked because he kept forging cancels for my and others' Usenet
posts, among other things I can't talk about. I believe the same person
can be reached through the penet.fi pseudonym "Skipper's Hammer," though. Hope this helps. At least with a stable nym, we'd be able to flame you for

This doesn't necessarily help if you work or study at a large institution
(stanford.edu, for example). It depends on what you want to keep private. If I want to moonlight or carry on a political discussion, I can use
untraceable nyms, but if someone wants to know where Rich Graves works,
then there is no way for me to stop them from finding out. That's not a
problem for me, obviously, but I've got 30,000 other people to worry
What whowhere.com did (whoswhere was a typo, yes -- it was late, and I was
rather pissed off) was grab the password file some time ago. We know that
they grabbed the password file because they have misspellings, odd
capitalizations, and daemon/group IDs that appear *only* in the password
file.  We know exactly when they did it, because the password file is
built sequentially. They have everything up to line 26,667, and nothing
after that line. We know exactly when account 26,668 was opened.
Search for "SITN Account" at organization "stanford.edu". These are
kerberos IDs that have never had email addresses. They have never existed
outside the password file.
They also have password files from a few other large educational and
commercial organizations. It is not clear that they broke the law getting
our password file, but in at least two other cases, it is.
The threat profile is this. We've got grad students and visiting lecturers
from repressive countries, or good-guy countries threatened by terrorists.
We've got some really famous people who don't want to be stalked.  These
people have unlisted phone numbers, unlisted email addresses, unlisted
physical addresses, and if you call the registrar for a transcript, the
registrar will neither confirm nor deny that Stanford has ever heard of
such a person. If you finger  these people will never show
up, no matter how you formulate the query. They're simply not in any
directory database.
If you grep one of the files that whowhere.com OBVIOUSLY used to build its
database, some of these people do show up. If you then finger that address
specifically, you might get the last login time and location, which might
tell you exactly where they live and work on campus. You can then send a
package with excessive postage, or something like that.
Never mind women (or men) being stalked by sticky-fingered psychopaths.
One person's paranoia is another person's reality.
In a way, I suppose we're "asking for it," because anyone with a
reasonable level of technical knowledge would know that the password file
the whowhere.com guys took is vulnerable, but the users who are now in a
public directory without their knowledge or consent were NOT asking for
it. Since the fact that they're at Stanford is one of the things some of
them might want to keep secret, there is no satisfactory compromise short
of removing all names and addresses collected in such unethical ways.
whowhere.com is in Mountain View; its principals live in Palo Alto, a
ten-minute bike ride from campus. If some (former) Stanford affiliate
helped them out, they're in trouble. If some (former) Stanford affiliate
didn't help them out, then they're in a lot more trouble.
They also have an entry for me as "Dick Graves - CDA Investigator." I
believe I used this in the From: line of two posts to su.* newsgroups that
do not propagate beyond nntp.stanford.edu. The presence of this address
means that they were building their database on Stanford computers, which
is a big, big no-no.

I explained/retracted/fudged this in a later message.
Some of the things a valid signature from Jack the Ripper means: 1. If it breaks something, I can send Jack the Ripper a bug report, or
   a flame, as appropriate.
2. If I like it, I can send Jack the Ripper money or other form of good
   vibes.
3. If I am Jack the Ripper, I have a way of proving that the code is my
   intellectual property.
4. If I'm not Jack the Ripper, I can say "That wasn't me."
5. If I am GNU, I can advertise and "enforce" my copyleft policy.
6. I have a way of knowing if Alice or Bob stuck a virus or trojan into
   Jack's code.
"Trust" really isn't the right word for what I'm getting at. Microsoft's
digital signature initiative is basically FUD with the spin "Only stuff
signed or endorsed by Microsoft is going to work," but I don't think that
this spin is inherent in signed code initiatives generally.
I think it would be a waste of time to build a multitiered security model
where applets with certain classes of signatures would be allowed to do
more. But signatures are still useful in a flat security model.
I think this is already all being done for Java, though, so never mind,
probably. I was just responding in a generally applicable way.

They did that too. They got recursive whois and finger sweeps dated
mid-1993 (we catch people doing whois aaaa*, aaab*, and so on every once
in a while), a Usenet-wide sweep dated early 1994, a sweep of local,
firewalled su.* newsgroups last December/January 95/96, and an outright
theft of the master shadow password file for most stanford.edu accounts
(address, real name, and UID only, no group ID or encrypted password) in
January 1996.
I'm sure they bought the first two from some other source.

I disagree that it's "hardly difficult" for most normal people. There are
bits and pieces of helpful information around, but they tend to be in
tax-protester-type rags that also contain a lot of loony stuff guaranteed
to land you in jail. And many of them are just snake oil scams themselves.
You know the difference, but I'm only starting to learn to, and Joe Schmo
hasn't a chance.
Anyway, I can't work for an organization like Stanford University without
a real name and Social Security number. In theory, I suppose, that real
name and Social Security number don't need to be the only ones I have.
In this case, I am the "someone else." How do I behave responsibly when I
have thousands of people coming in every Fall with no clue about privacy
I have to go after the leaks. Of course I know that none of my clients has
any real security or privacy, but stopping such information from being
trivially available on public web servers at least helps stave off the
random nutcase. Restricting the field to more specific nutcases, with or
without official titles, helps with the threat profile.
It was an uphill battle just to delink identity, location, and DNS
registration. It used to be that you could pinpoint a student's name,
address, and telephone number by their personal computer's static IP
address. They weren't even told that this was possible. On yesterday's
lovey-dovey research/educational Internet where everybody trusted
everybody else, it was just more efficient for troubleshooters and system
administrators to know where everybody was. Now, it's a scarier world, and
we all know that, but it's tough convincing people to change a system that
works. My personal choice has been (near-) complete openness, because I
ironically feel more secure if it is trivial for certain very specific
nutcases to verify that I pose no threat to them. I do not wish my enemies
to be paranoid. Paranoid people break things. I've chosen the security of
the high ground rather than the secuurity of the cave. Of course, I'm
learning to keep my personal life personal, and one day, I might find it
useful to disappear.

No, it simply means he thinks that Bell is a loon. I thought that for a

the last few months, as I know I have. Nobody is irredeemable. I have
never killfiled anyone, though I've ignored people from time to time as a
way of controllin gmy blood pressure.
Detweiler was right when he talked about the thin skins and huge egos
here. Why cry "censor" when somebody simply tells you to shut up? It's
called social pressure, and it's a good thing. You may respond to social
pressure however you wish. Likewise "PC." He may correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you are
mistaken in your implication that hochiminh means to imply that TC May is
a racist. "Ignorance and intolerance" are different animals entirely, and
speaking on a purely analytical rather than moral level, I believe these
terms are accurately applied to Tim's statements, especially about
non-English speakers and nuking the Japs.  But I recognize Tim's good
humor (in all three meanings), and think he's a great guy, as are most of
the inmates in this particular asylum. My parents and a couple of friends at work are right-wing fundamentalist
loons, and a couple of friends from school are left-wing multiculturalist
loons. From this vantage point, I learn a lot. It's really funny comparing
the presentation of left-wingers in right-wing propaganda to the
presentation of right-wingers in left-wing propaganda. It seems that
cypherpunks gets the worst extremes of both. Sometimes I play along (too
often, probably, so I'm learning how to resist being trolled -- Michael
Loomis's laughable "Rich Graves, Holocaust fetishist" was a good test),
sometimes I just sit back and watch.
You will see none of these terms anywhere but in failed trial balloons and
parodies of the supposedly politically correct, of course. It's really
amazing how a myth can take on a life of its own. The left has the same kind of ludicrous misconceptions about the religious
right. I'll tell my parents some of the things my leftist friends have
been told about some of the organizations my parents belong to, and they
say, huh? Tell a feminist what Pat Robertson says about feminists, and she
says, huh?
I once met a guy in Hollister who did.
I still resent being packed off to church, and I certainly oppose state-

someone else's beliefs, or who intentionally disrupts someone else's

I would agree with this wholeheartedly if you turned down the volume about

of words such as, "WhoWhere? is an effort by a team from Stanford GSB and
engineering school," and for assuming that the use of the Stanford name on
a number of publicly available web pages indicated an active Stanford
affiliation. In retrospect, I recognize that these were typographical
errors, just like the four glaring HTML bugs and handful of security holes
we've found so far (which are now publicly available information). Please take care to avoid such misunderstandings in the future by
refraining from introducing yourselves in these ways, especially where
such claims are likely to become publicly available information. No, some of it is clearly not. Or if we do have such a serious security
breach, then Stanford is violating Federal laws concerning the privacy of
student records, and I would very much like to fix the problem, because I
do not wish to go to prison. As I asked you and your technical droid
before, please let me know how you obtained the "SITN Account" entries
without delay. If your selection of publicly available information
repositories is not considered publicly available information, then I
would be happy to sign a nondisclosure agreement. The fact that I have
signed such a nondisclosure agreement would, of course, become publicly

Larry Schwimmer with the email address siockman at leland.Stanford.EDU. We
believe that this association only happened once, where it would not have

I have every hope that we will be able to settle this to our mutual

What alternative social orders can you envision that would handle this
problem elegantly? I can't think of any off the top of my head. Medical savings plans do not work for anyone but the extremely rich and
healthy, because few normal people can self-insure to cover the risk. With
pooled risk, the prospective customer has the right to know the risks
already in the pool before diving in. Contracts based on infinite

There's also the little matter of letting your doctor know your medical

Another interesting issue for privacy is setting the granularity of the

you tell the distributing service that you like site A, then the rating
service has the potential to become a way to track people (to a certain

think it's reasonable to have different views regarding how much money was
involved and who knew what when (my view is very little, and medium). What I
object to are conspiracy theories along the lines of: 1. The Reagan Administration used the Contras to smuggle crack to the US in
   a deliberate attempt at genocide against Black people. (I heard this a
   lot, though seldom in so many words, on KPFK in the mid-80's; the SJ Merc
   series certainly has this as a subtext.)
2. Clinton was a CIA agent involved in the Contra drug-smuggling CaBaL. He
   was involved in anti-war protests only as a CIA informant. (This is the
   suggestion of the Morris book.)
3. Anything involving the Kennedy assassination, Donna Rice, or Elvis.

This does not accurately represent what I said, and it certainly does not represent what I have done. You are still identified as "My friend Declan," and I recommend that people visit your site.
I actually would have appreciated it if you had crowed, or at least shared, your media contacts. For example, I only just now found out about Steve Pizzo's poorly researched article in Web Review, where he presents as my views deliberate lies that I told Zundel in order to get his cooperation and trust.
This does not accurately reflect your mail. At this time, you have not
removed my full name, either. You will find that Haggai had been Cc'd on several messages back and forth
on fight-censorship, and he was Bcc'd on my original request (at the
header of my message to you was a notice that it was being Bcc'd to other
people at Stanford).  While I don't appreciate his mommying me, I hardly
consider his mail unsolicited or unwarranted, since you have still failed
to honor my request. The "speech code" was never applied to anyone, and was widely regarded to be unenforceable. I opposed it. It was a joke, yes.
What were we talking about again?
Then you, kadie, and I agree. I have a point. Why do you persist in identifying, in two places, a Stanford University Mirror Site?
I strongly disagree.
Which has more symbolic power for good, a single man standing in front of
a tank in Tiananmen Square, or nuking Hiroshima and Nagasaki?
It is not ethical to abuse this power we have. Especially because neither of us are students at the universities whose machines we are abusing.
I do understand the way the media works. They live on "press releases" from "recognized authorities." Most Since my mirror site has been limited to .edu and selected other domains for a full day, this is an odd question. The demonstrable harm, as you now agree, is that the Ottawa Times,  the Stormfront-L neo-nazi list, and so on are full of lies about how universities sympathetic to Zundel's fight against Zionist oppression and the Holocaust Lie have jumped to his No distributors. Only point sources. And as has been pointed out, they often get off with a slap on the wrist.
You have been duped by Zundel's false claims of persecution. I bet you even bought the "Dr. Axl Clocstein" story for a while.
1. As I've been saying for the last day and a half, please remove all occurrences of the strings "Stanford" and "Graves." I hardly think that requesting not to be so identified is egotistical.
2. While you're at it, it would be good to remove the following as well, which does not accurately reflect the facts.
 In early January, Zundel contacted the Simon Wiesenthal Center and asked
 permission to reproduce some of their materials. He wanted to disprove
 some of their views as he had tried to rebut those of the Nizkor Project.
 (The Nizkor folks earlier had requested bidirectional linking. Zundel
 agreed to their request, heralding the experiment as "The Great Internet
 Holocaust Debate.")
Nizkor's response to this is rather prominent on their Web site.
3. Please fix this:
 January 29, 1996: This site goes online, with the help of files supplied
 by Rich (rich at c2.org), supplemented with more recent documents taken
 directly from the Zundelsite. Rich's site at Stanford University goes
 online. (Note that Rich and I mirrored the Zundelsite at our own
 initiative, not by request.)
To bolster Zundel's coyright claim against the National Alliance, please
clarify that "we" specifically requested the materials from Zundel, and
that his handler Marc uploaded them all to "one of our machines" (since we
could not have run a WebWacker on the highly overloaded webcom.com). Also remove the string "Stanford." In any case, the files are no longer available at Stanford.
4. February 1, 1996: Web Review Magazine reports on the mirror sites.
I have sent mail to Steve Pizzo and requested that he call me to correct some false statements attributed to me.
5. February 1, 1996, afternoon: UMass censors mirror. Simon Wiesenthal
   Center sends letters of protest to participating mirror universities.
   Sameer announces University of California at Berkeley mirror. Every one of these is false.
a. The operator of the UMass mirror objects to your characterization of    what happened as "censorship," and to your posting his private mail.
b. Where is your confirmation of Simon Wiesenthal's action?
c. Sameer has not announced a UC Berkeley mirror. He specifically asked    that it not be listed because like most of us, he is beginning to have
   ethical qualms. 6. On index.html you have:
 There is an apparent campaign of email and web bombing being launched
 againt Zundel's site on Webcom, making it near-impossible to reach. Do you have a source for this besides me? Well, I retract the rumor. In
fact it seems that the problem is that Zundel foolishly put a bunch of
huge RealAudio files on his page that are overloading the server.

I was surprised and disappointed to learn recently that there are no public archives of the Stormfront list. Many organizations, most of whom are strongly opposed to Stormfront's goals, seem to be keeping private logs of everything that is said on Stormfront-L, but to date none have made their archives public.
I find this silly. It's an open list, after all, and you know that people who do not share your goals are reading the list. With all this talk about The Enemy and free expression, it's odd that only The Enemy has accurate chronicles, and that you deny the general public the right to read what you say.
To address this oversight, I will be opening up my personal archives of Stormfront-L to public view on c2.org's Web server. I haven't worked out the details yet, but I'll probably be using hypermail, if this use is judged to satisfy the license terms.
Don't bother unsubscribing me. There are lots of people who would be only too happy to send me their copies of list mail, anonymized. Don't bother moving to another list, either, unless you don't mind losing all members of the list whose loyalties cannot be established beyond a reasonable doubt. See, you can't exactly announce on the list that you're moving to a new list where The Enemy can't find you.
Despite the fact that it has always been trivial to determine the list membership, I plan to respect list members' privacy by giving you all a day to avail yourselves of the large number of anonymity and double-
blind pseudonymity resources available on the Internet.
For information on the most well-known remailer, the penet.fi anonymous contact service, send email to both help at anon.penet.fi (sends you the FAQ) and ping at anon.penet.fi (assigns you an ID). The disadvantages of the penet.fi service are that it is slow (mail is delayed as much as 24 hours) and that it is not really secure (records of which IDs belong to which real email address are kept on a computer in Finland, and are therefore available to very determined law enforcement officers and other armed thugs).
Those with a technical bent may wish to look into more secure cypherpunk remailers, but they require some brains. Even I don't really use them.
Alternatively, if one or more of you have the means and incentive to set up a public Stormfront-L archive on the Internet, and very soon, then please let me know, and I will drop my plans. The advantages of an official public list archive run by someone who shares your goals should be obvious. Of course, private archives will still be kept by third parties in order to ensure that the official archive remains accurate and up to date. Checks and balances, natch.
I would be happy to provide some technical assistance if you need help getting started.
On to copyrights. The issue of who owns the copyrights to the Zundelsite pages has been raised both privately and publicly (very It appears that Mr. Zundel has made his choice.

I'm working on a T-shirt for the "Zundel Detournement" contest right now. I doubt any of you would be interested in buying one, though.
Still, it would be much better if a formal network of mirror sites was established. That way you'd have a channel for receiving updates direct from Zundel's webmasters. Unfortunately, it seems that Mr. Zundel is embarrassed by the thought of being associated with the people who actually want to mirror his site for the content. He has had to  publicly distance himself from the very proud white supremacist Joe Bunkley, for example.

I am not a free speech activist. As Rosa Parks explains her refusing to

belongs to all of us, and if parts of it are cordoned off for even the
most noble political reasons, then we are all diminished, and totalitarian
regimes like China's are given another excuse. This was an important point
to underscore, but it should be noted that all I did was send a half dozen
electronic mail messages and copy a few files, which took less than an
hour of my time. No less important than the fight against censorship itself, for me, is
that hateful demagogues like Ernst Zundel be denied their spurious appeals
to "anti-censorship." Mr. Zundel is no more of a free speech activist than
are the leaders of the IRA. Repression only breeds criminality. As Tolkien or any good German fairy tale will tell you, the evil troll,
when exposed to the light of day, will turn to stone. Evil trolls like Mr.
Zundel might still frighten children, but as statues in the Wiesenthal

our mirror sites. Now the onus is on Mr. Zundel, in the spotlight of world
attention, to reveal his true friends by calling on them to come to his
aid. Now we know that Mr. Zundel's friends include Joe Bunkley, a
notorious racist at Georgia State University. Joe Bunkley's mirror site,
and those of other friendly mirror sites, cannot all be censored; in fact,
to my knowledge, no action has been taken against any mirror site. Indeed, the DFN/WiN network that serves most German universities restored access to Mr. Zundel's original site some days ago. Let Mr. Zundel's conspiracy theories about Jews and UFO bases in
Antarctica into the public domain, and let us see who will believe them,
and who will laugh. I am a great fan of Milan Kundera, who teaches us that
the only responses to a totalitarian buffoon are laughter and memory.
Nizkor: we will remember. (No, I'm not Jewish)
Zundel's hate should never be ignored, but it can be publicly refuted and
ridiculed, which has far greater moral and practical effect than
censorship. "Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty" can be interpreted many ways. Let freedom ring.

At first I wondered why you'd want to send encrypted mail you couldn't sign with your own key, but on second thought, I can think of a lot of I'd think that much of the hard and unique work would be, first, proper
interface design, and second, putting together an efficient database and
database extraction mechanism for huge key rings (I notice that the MIT
keyserver was recently upgraded; talk to them). While the PGP 3.0 API
would help with the implementation, I see no reason to wait on these
infrastructure steps.  The final version would use the more secure and
efficient API, but quick modular hacks for steps that would be fulfilled
by the API should be all that is needed. If you put together a proof-of-concept model, even one that doesn't really work, I think you'd see this idea take off. I see no reason to wait, and while I'm certainly no CODERpunk, I'd be more than happy to play with user interface mockups in my copious free time...  Institute for Ernst Zundel Revisionism

I applaud your quick response. However, you should read more and consult
people with area expertise. At least do the five-minute AltaVista and DejaNews search I did; don't just trust the information that gets sent to you, or you're likely to be used. I think you're at least 95% right here, but it is worth noting that The
Post has ties to the former dictator of Zambia, who was replaced by the
more or less democratically elected Chiluba whose ouster you so
precipitously are demanding. First impressions and fast action are often
necessary, but it's not responsible to stop there. Life & death politics
isn't a toy. Chiluba is no saint, but he's no two-bit dictator, either.
I'd probably rate him a notch or two below Aristide, no worse. He's
certainly no Castro, Kim, or Idi Amin.Chiluba is pretty good by
Sub-Saharan African standards (which, unfortunately, isn't saying much). For informed opinion, you should start with the Association of Concerned
African Scholars:  You might want to add Amnesty International's 1995 report on Sub-Saharan
Africa, which has some background on Zambia and Chiluba:  For those who read Swedish, this appears to be a more specific Amnesty  See Chiluba's comments on Nigerian human rights violations:

No, you shouldn't care what I think. You should care about being right. Which I think you are, at least 95% of the time. But calling for Chiluba's
ouster after a couple hours' reading is a little hasty IMO. I'd have
stopped at something like, "Chiluba again showed his lack of respect for
democratic institutions and the free press by censoring the newspaper
reproduced below. He has also been criticized by the US State Department
and Amnesty International, though Zambia's record is better than that of
many other Sub-Saharan African states, most notably Nigeria, Rwanda, and
Burundi (which you might consider small praise indeed)." He's no hero, but I'd reserve the "Get the hell out" rhetoric for complete
tyrants who kill people for fun, and tolerate no independent press at all. There's plenty of those around. You'll be taken more seriously (and I think you SHOULD be taken more seriously) if you don't overreact.

You're taking this phrase out of context. What the Declaration said was:
1. There are certain universal human rights, like life, liberty, and    property^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H the pursuit of happiness.
2. To protect these rights, people form governments. Only the baddest kid    on the block can protect her own rights, and only if she never sleeps.    The rest of us need the police.
3. Ergo, government derives its just powers from the consent of the    governed. I read this more as a conclusion than as a premise.
This is all that Hobbes, Locke, and Montequieu said. Rousseau was different, but he was a kook.
This is quite different from saying, "The government has the right to do
what the majority says it can do." Government doesn't have any rights,
only delegated powers.
A utilitarian like Mill or a positivist like Comte or a trader like Smith,
or I, would say that government power shouldn't be restricted to the
protection of basic rights. Public goods should also be pooled to do
things that people can't or won't do by themselves -- garbage collection,
health and disability insurance, protecting "the commons" with
environmental regulations, etc. But these utilitarian-type interests don't really fall into the power/rights game.

BREAKING THE CODE
by Hugh Whitemore
Based on the Book: Alan Turing: The Enigma by Andrew Hodges
The private life of an extraordinary and brilliant man becomes the means of
his destruction in this dramatic story, which won acclaim on Broadway. At its
center is Alan Turing, the mathematician and British war hero who broke the
famous German Enigma Code, giving the Allies the key to winning World War II,
and yet was persecuted by his government for his sexual orientation. This
portrait of a complex, visionary man torn by society's conflicting rules is
chillingly powerful.

Agreed. They're a bureaucracy and a statist entity. But states are distinct and antagonistic entities. There's no world government.
As someone who worked with Terry Karl in El Salvador, I also think your
Central American history is a bit off, but that's off topic, and normal
for the US. Agreed that Chomsky is usually rather weak on the facts, which
is why he is seldom cited in academic journals; he's really just a darling
of the press, because the man exudes eggheadedness and erudite sarcasm. He
never should have strayed from developmental linguistics. I don't see this happening.
The NSA is logically allied with other organizations of greater
repressiveness, inasmuch as it is not really in the interest of the NSA to
pursue absolute freedom anywhere. Certainly they have no desire for anyone
in the world to enjoy privacy. However, this logical symmetry does not
translate to practical collaboration. You think the NSA and the Chinese
government trust each other at all? They're spying on each other.
One certainly observes strange bedfellow situations among three letter
agencies (the Iran/Contra affair; Cuban and South African aiding of
insurgents of every political stripe; US intelligence information on Iran
provided to Iraq); but one also observes strange conflicts (the Pollard
affair, Israel's spying on the US; back to Dreyfuss; intrigue within the
EC).

clearly disqualify NT Server from a C2 rating in a network environment, at least when NetWare services are used. Real NetWare servers do qualify for a C2 rating.  owner-win95netbugs at lists.stanford.edu

@_subject: Microsoft continues to mislead public about Windows security bugs (a bit long, with references) 
Please do not dismiss this as mere "Microsoft Bashing." c2.org has
similar promotions running for Netscape, DigiCash, and Java. The following is a quote from Microsoft's "Knowledge Base" technical
support and marketing database, which is online in CompuServe and at:     Security of the Windows for Workgroups Password Cache
  _____________________________________________________
  The password list file is encrypted with an algorithm that meets the U.S.
  government Data Encryption Standard (DES). This encryption technology is
  the highest security allowed in software exported from the United States.
  The odds of breaking the encryption algorithm are less than those for
  random guesses of what the password might be.
  Even if your logon password is blank, Windows for Workgroups generates
  seemingly random data in your PWL file, so you cannot discover the
  passwords if you look at the PWL file using a file viewer. Currently, no
  user interface exists that allows you to unencrypt passwords in the PWL
  file, so password caching in Windows for Workgroups is as secure as the
  choice of the password used to encrypt your PWL file.
As Microsoft well knows, this is completely untrue. The rest of the world
has known that this is untrue since November 29th. Microsoft quietly
acknowledged on December 7th (after a day of much "Internet Strategy"
hype, and after the deadline for the morning papers) that the exact same
implementation was insecure in Windows 95, and claims to have released a
patch that fixes the problem (the efficacy of the Win95 patch does not
appear to have been verified by anyone outside Microsoft, however). Microsoft has not even admitted that this bug in both Windows 95 and
Windows for Workgroups affects Windows for Workgroups, apparently because
they have decided not to fix it. Information on the .PWL implementation bugs was first broached on the sci.crypt newsgroup in late November 1995, then discussed on the cypherpunks list and refined for Community ConneXion's "Hack Microsoft"
promotion, We have since been given a sample trojan horse that will very efficiently
exploit this bug in Windows for Workgroups. Distributed as a Word Basic
virus, MIME attachment, or downloadable archive (note that Exchange and
Internet Explorer unwisely execute downloaded binaries without even a
virus check, a problem that Sun's Java has long acknowledged and
addressed), this trojan horse could collect passwords and other sensitive
information from .PWL files and other sources and send them out via email,
possibly through an untraceable chain of remailers or to a throwaway
trial account on, for example, America "Online." We believe that it would be highly irresponsible to release the full
version of this hack, but we will soon release a crippled
demonstration-only version if Microsoft does not at the very least admit
that this problem has always affected Windows for Workgroups, correct
their online documentation, publish the specifications of the Win95
security patch for review by outside security experts, and issue a public
retraction. See also:
          {mirror of above}   {mirror of above} ftp://ftp.demon.co.uk/pub/mirrors/win95net/
  {more mirrors are under construction in Australia and elsewhere}
In other news, I assume everyone knows by now that NT's claimed C2
security rating was granted *for use a standalone workstation only*. It
has been widely reported that its NetWare Services implementation does
not ask for passwords for nonexistent usernames, making a potential
cracker's job that much easier. The correct response, which is given by
real NetWare servers and other servers that are certified C2-secure on
networks, is to silently ask for a password in all cases. I started getting copies of hackmsoft at c2.org mail on December 20th. It's really depressing.
We've also seen problems with Microsoft Access 95's security. Basically,
there is none. Anyone can access the network-enabled Access as any user
without knowing the password. We don't think it would be responsible to
publicly release this hack, either, until Microsoft has had another
chance to patch the hole (they've known about it for some time). These are far, far worse than the widely publicized bugs in Netscape's
SSL implementation, which have been fixed. Yet the only place I've seen
them mentioned is the lapdog Seattle Times, which only reports bug
*fixes* in glowing terms. Is anybody listening?

of computing power because the guvmint puts limits on the key size, and a
stupid implementation that is far, far less secure than (X,Y) because of

@_subject: [CORRECTION] Microsoft continues to mislead public about Windows security 
In a couple of silly posts, I'd uncritically repeated a Bob Cringely piece
in the December 10th InfoWorld (plus various other sources) without
adequately verifying the facts. I hope this will clear some things up. First, NT was C2-certified in a specific configuration as a standalone
workstation only, not as a network server. So any points about NT's C2
security being compromised by the following problems are *moot* and should
be ignored.
1. NetWare Services lets you know when you try to log on as a user that    doesn't exist, rather than asking for a password. Real NetWare servers    do the right thing.
2. Because of a common user error, documentation errors, and a couple bugs,
   it is possible to gain read-only access to the root directory of many    NT FTP servers (20% of the known NT servers at Stanford when I checked --
   this has been fixed) by giving a nonexistent username and password,
   for example, cypherpunks/cypherpunk, to Microsoft's FTP server.
These aren't important, because Microsoft does not claim that NT Server,
as a server, is C2-secure; only many authorized distributors do. Also, the note that NetWare was C2-certified is misleading. I've been told and find credible (but have not verified) that NetWare was only certified in an unusual environment with packet-encrypting NICs.
The rest was true. The main point was that Microsoft continues to make
statements that are clearly at variance with the truth concerning the acknowledged .PWL, IPX SAP, and SMB bugs, among others. Microsoft has yet to revise several known incorrect pertinent articles in
their "Knowledge" Base technical/marketing database, which you can search
via:   Incorrect articles include Q92588, Q90210, Q36634, Q103887, Q120554, and
especially Q90271.
The specific URL for each of these articles is:
  For example, the article that purports to contain technical information on
why you can trust the security of .PWL files is:   Also,  the
PR on the "fix" for the acknowledged .PWL bugs in Win95 (the same bugs
exist in Windows 3.11, but Microsoft has not acknowledged this or
committed to fixing it), is clearly incorrect. It says that the new
algorithm is 2^96 times more secure because it uses a larger key. Besides
the fact that the extreme weakness of the .PWL algoritm has nothing
whatsoever to do with the key size, the new algorithm does not use 128
random bits. Like many other exportable algorithms, the key size is 128
bits, but only 40 bits are random. By the way, neither I nor the comp.risks moderator have heard a peep from
any Microsoft source in any newsgroup or mailbox. This I find somewhat
disheartening. We know that there are at least five microsoft.com
addresses on cypherpunks because we all got bounced email when Microsoft
broke their mail gateway. Cat got your tongue?

maintaining computerized records with just about any kind of information
about people without a license, and censorship in general.

Gould was right, Edmund Burke and Karl Marx were wrong).
Usually, the mutations (in biology or politics) are minor, and almost
always, they are localized.
Large-scale catastrophes like a meteor hitting the earth and killing all
the dinosours (or whatever happened), or nuclear war, or whatever, are
larger punctuation than normal. Sometimes the ecosystem recovers,
sometimes a completely new ecosystem forms, sometimes all life but the
cockroaches is wiped out. Politically and morally, I'm a follower of the realist school (Morgenthau
et al). It is right for the US to dominate the world because it has the
most power. On the level of international relations, it doesn't matter how
it got that way; trying to reverse the power realities would be like
trying to dam the Pacific Ocean. Of course, in specific cases in the
present, we can make moral choices, and if we feel like it, we can help
out the present victims of historical "immorality" (like the fact that the
descendants of slaves weren't born into the same inheritance as the
descendants of the Carnegies and Vanderbilts). Sympathy is the wrong emotion for both politics and science, but then,
what you're talking about isn't sympathy. Cute cuddly seals and frieldly dolphins and teddy bears get "sympathy"
among mainstrean "environmentalists," and the Sierra Club and World
Wildlife Federation calendars raise a lot of money, but it's the plants
and bugs and bacteria that are really important. Elephants and blue whales
look big and important to us, but they're really inconsequential in the
larger scheme of biodiversity. They could go extinct and the planet
doesn't really care. But kill the blue-green algae and the trees, and
we're all dead.

[Apologies to everyone for not just kill-filing this.]
If it's all the same to you, I'd prefer to tell them myself, in context,
in public posts rather than in off-topic redistributed private email. In the last year I've inaccurately been labeled a Nazi, a Communist, a
Maoist, a Jew, an Anti-Semite, a KKK tool, an Anarchist, a Spic-Lover, a
Capitalist Stooge, a Tool of the Ruling Class if not an Oppressor Myself,
and a lawyer. Now I'm a Fucking Statist. Oh well. I defer to your four years' experience
on FIDONet, where you talked to "dozens" of people, who I am sure know
more about alternative political systems than the folks I worked with in
my four years studying Latin American history and political science at
Stanford. For example, Roberta Lajous, international affairs chair of the
Mexican PRI, who is a very intelligent and fair-minded person, but who can
accurately be described as a Fucking Statist, and Rodolfo Stavenhagen, a
Professor at el Colegio de Mexico who spoke at the recent Conference of
Indigenous Peoples called by el Ejercito zapatista de liberacion nacional.
Not to mention the Cubans, Sandinistas, Contras, and Salvadoran liberation
theologists I've known, four of whom were murdered in cold blood at their
seminary, in 1992 I believe. My good friend Istvan Feher lobbed Molotav
cocktails at Russian tanks on his way out of Budapest in 1956, and my last
serious girlfriend was a political refugee from Czechoslovakia who was
studying Soviet politics (you see, I haven't had a serious relationship
for a while). I simply prefer civilization to revolution, and structured ethical
restraint to retaliation. I believe government derives its just powers
from the consent of the governed with the purpose of securing fundamental
rights, and that there are such things as justice, consent, and
fundamental rights such as personal privacy that must not be abridged by
any body, whether defined as a government or not. Since I'm obviously a tool of the government who doesn't deserve privacy,
why not post everything you can find about me? I assure you that you could
find something quite damaging if you tried. I'll even give you hints in

What "anonymous" said (below). I had permission to forward this, but I
figured it might attract more interest if it were "anonymous" to people
who can't read headers. Almost two months after Peter and Frank demonstrated that it was untrue,
and one month and five days after Microsoft "significantly improved"
Windows 95 by providing a patch for the exact same algorithm, Microsoft
this very second still says that the .PWL algorithm as used in Windows for
Workgroups is secure.  This article will also be included on thousands of copies of the February
TechNet CD-ROM. Other Knowledge Base articles have been corrected in less than a day.
Yusuf's statement that my January 16th email is the first that he had
heard of the .PWL problem is both patently ridiculous and directly
contradicted by private email from anonymous sources on this list whom
T. C. May has killfiled. In other news, the international versions of the SMB and C$ bug fixes
exploited by Samba and Paul Brainard were finally posted today (as usual,
they're dated yesterday). So the non-US public shares listed on, for
example,  no longer have to be completely open to everyone
on the Internet. Yusuf Mehdi, the Windows 95 Product Manager, had told me
on November 9th that these internationalized patches would be posted
"within two weeks." No excuse for this two-month delay has been offered. Yusuf also, well, lied on November 9th when he said that Microsoft had
"sent mail to the newsgroups" retracting their statement that the SMB bug was caused by Samba sending "illegal network commands," and clarifying that the patches dated October 20th only work on US/English versions of Windows 95.
The original Microsoft announcement as released to the media and WinNews is at:  gopher://quixote.stanford.edu/0R593020-600291-/win95netbugs
The current version, which contrary to Yusuf's statements on November 9th does not indicate that there has been any change, is at:
 By the way, MSN is going to allow access via TCP/IP soon. Let's make sure
they do it securely. Would you like me to confirm it for WfW?
Actually you can problably do it for Win95 by removing the password file the initial connect.  If Win95 can reconnect with the password file missing,
then the passwords are still in memory.  You'll have to be careful though to
make sure they're not being read from the Windows disk cache, loading Word between killing the connection and trying to reconnect should clear the
password file from the cache.
Given that the descriptor tables are apparently unprotected in Win95 (which pretty incredible), it shouldn't be too hard to get access to all of memory
the background without the user even being aware of it.
Sorry about the delay in getting this to you, as I mentioned before it was on a
machine a fair way away, stuck behind a firewall.  I haven't included all SMTP stuff and whatnot because there's quite a bit of it and it's boring, routines which do all the work are the following...
This is the function called by WNetEnumCachedPasswords() to enumerate each
[*CODE DELETED*]
    /* Record the password information */
[*CODE DELETED*]
    /* Signify that we want to move to the next entry */
[*CODE DELETED*]
This is the function which actually does the enumeration.  The for() loop
defines what resources you want to get passwords for.
[*CODE DELETED*]
    /* Get the proc. address of the password manipulation function */
[*CODE DELETED*]
    /* Enumerate the passwords */
[*CODE DELETED*]
To find out (for example) what disk drive resources you're using:
    /* Check each drive to see if it's a network resource */
    for( driveNo = 2; driveNo < 26; driveNo++ )
        if( GetDriveType( driveNo ) == DRIVE_REMOTE )
            {
            char password[ 100 ], resource[ 100 ];
            char *driveName = "x:";
            WORD passwordLength = 100, resourceLength = 100;
            BYTE resourceNo;
            int i;
            /* Find the name of the network resource for this drive number             *driveName = 'A' + driveNo;
            WNetGetConnection( driveName, resource, &resourceLength );
            }
This code should be modifiable by anyone to get any password for any I'll leave it to you to decide how much to publish, the worry is that if you
publish all of it people will whine about it helping hackers.  Might I something like:
    /* Get the proc. address of the password manipulation function */
    WNetEnumCachedPasswords = ( LPWNETENUMCACHEDPASSWORDS ) \
                                GetProcAddress( WNetGetCaps( 0xFFFF ), \
                                                MAKEINTRESOURCE( ORD_WNETENUMCACHEDPASSWORDS ) );
    if( WNetEnumCachedPasswords == NULL )
        exit( EXIT_FAILURE );
    /* Enumerate the passwords for the resources we want.  This only gets        first password, in practice we'd keep calling        until the enumPasswordProc() tells us (via the returned status) to        then move on to the next resource */
    for( resourceNo = START_RESOURCE; resourceNo <= END_RESOURCE; resourceNo++ )
        status = ( *WNetEnumCachedPasswords )( "", 0, ( BYTE ) resourceNo, \
                                               enumPasswordProc );
This shows how simple it is, but doesn't give people something they can just
cut and paste into their own code to get something which will give them all
passwords.  You may want to include the "find drive resources" code fragment well as an example of how to do this, although it's not really necessary.
Feel free to forward this to whoever you think is appropriate, although it's
probably best not to give the get-any-password capable version to the

revolution at all but a secession from a tyrannical regime. Part of the
reason it did well was that remoteness and bravery led those involved to

they still ended up with the Whiskey Rebellion, a great expansion of the

[Let me say up front that beyond a lot of perl hacking, I've never had
 a need to code my way out of a paper bag, so this is not something I'd
 be able to implement myself, at least not without a month of study.]
OK, so we know how to crack .PWL files, and how any program (virus, trojan
horse, Windows Help file calling a DLL beginning with ASCII 229 so that
virus scanners can't see it) can obtain usernames, passwords, etc. even if
persistent "password caching" to disk has been turned off. How might Microsoft (or someone else) address this without forcing users
to quit all applications and "log out" of Windows to purge the temporary
"password cache" in RAM? I.e., I don't care much about and know I can't
count on the security of my PC as such, and it's really convenient to
leave a zillion Popular Web Browser windows open when I walk out of my
office, but I don't like the idea that anyone might walk up to my PC and
log on as me to the otherwise (more or less) secure servers I use. In thinking about how MacOS PowerTalk deals with this by allowing the user
to "lock" and "unlock" their keychain at will, it occurred to me that
there's no particular reason we should just have to "look, don't touch"
the password cache in RAM. After all, it's our insecure single-user
operating system, and our passwords. Why not provide a way to grab the passwords cached in RAM, encrypt them securely, put them away somewhere, and scramble the original copy of the passwords in RAM so that Microsoft's code can't get to them?
We don't need no steenking user interface. Actually, the first cut at
this wouldn't really need to encrypt them securely, but just deny them to
the OS, and restore them to the OS, on demand. Just a quick demo of how Microsoft can and should resolve this issue would
have people beating down our door, and we'd unambiguously be the good
guys. Because we'd be providing the solution, there would be no further moral qualms about posting full details and full source code.

Mostly true. But state governments and state politicians have been naughty

to mind.
However, I think "an eye for an eye" is the wrong approach in the first
place. There's an opportunity for education here, and progress.
This is clever, but I don't think it works. There is a legitimate public
interest here. Even if there's nothing incriminating in the email messages
themselves, the questions of how much government business is conducted
electronically, and how much non-government business (personal matters,
political fund-raising) is conducted on publicly funded computers on
government time are legitimate.
Pertsonally, I'd be reluctant to peep into every message ever sent on a
government computer -- it's too voyeuristic for my tastes. I'm especially
thinking about that poor staffer who was grilled by the Whitewater Committee
about one use of the word "bastard" in an unrelated email message to a

I'd like to see politicians put on official notice that all email on
publicly owned computers is public property, though it would be hard to
draw the line where politicians and political appointees end and the
innocent line employee begins. If the politicians end up using crypto on
government computers, great -- maybe they'd start to "get it." If the
politicians want to open accounts with outside ISPs on their own (or their
political party's) dime, great -- that's what a lot of other people on this
list have had to do. Of course if some politician starts using an outside
account for official business (and only then), then that account becomes
fair game for public disclosure as well. It's a matter of ethics and
Because politicians have not yet been put on official notice that this is
the policy, though, I would not endorse making this policy retroactive and
grepping all their email for dirt, unless the public has something like
probable cause to do so. Next year, sure, it's all public record.
Politicians should be educated that privacy without strong encryption is
illusory anyway. Making a law that the public can't read their email simply
isn't going to work. It's unenforceable. Sure it'll slow down the rate of
public disclosure a bit. Still, some disgruntled ex-employee, or some
Woodward & Bernstein type, or Jim Bell :-), is bound to get through.

Sorta, but not really.
Relying on gentlemanliness to protect privacy is a fallacy.
Assuming that gentlemen run the government (or any other entity with power

Thing. The fact that the well-informed people on this list tend to be good
ladies and gentlemen is a Very Good Thing.
I believe that the choice not to read other people's personal mail is an
ethical imperative, since we do not have and probably can not have total
privacy enforced by technology and law alone. Sure, strong crypto helps,
and should be spread, but there will always be back doors and
implementation bugs, and in the worst case, most people will give in to
moderate torture. It's hard to say what the ethical role of individuals in the government

Tim seems to have a selective fascination with the general idea "if a rule
is not enforceable, it's not valid." Applied to crypto, the right to bear arms and biological weapons, censorship, etc.
This is a tautology. By definition, rules are made about things that are
not self-enforcing. That's why you make the rule. That's why some people like societies.
Some rules are good, some are bad. The non-self-enforcing rule that your
kid shouldn't put a finger in a light socket or cross the street without
looking is probably a good rule. The rule against the export of strong
cryptography is generally, and universally on this list, considered to be
a bad rule. Whether the rule is enforceable is irrelevant.

The problems futplex et al were having are the result of a known
incompatibility between Windows [95] and many print spoolers. You can fix
it like so: Shamelessly lifted from the discussion forum on NetWork World's Web site,  owner-win95netbugs at lists.stanford.edu
 ftp://ftp.stanford.edu/pub/mailing-lists/win95netbugs/
 gopher://quixote.stanford.edu/1m/win95netbugs
 I have a problem when printing to postscript printers spooled from unix hosts. I am running Win95 and FTP Software's
Interdrive 95 (for the lpr client).
The problem is that the printer spits out pages of postscript code rather than the page the code represents. This
happens only when I print over the network. If I plug directly into the printer, everything works fine.
It seems that Microsoft improved the pscript.drv to also send "PJL" code to printers. Thus, the actual postscript is
surrounded by PJL. Redirect a postscript printer to a file and take a look.
Unfortunately, this causes the spooler on the unix host to identify the print job as a plain ascii file, rather than a
postscript file. Other than manually editting every print job and copying it to the printer port, is there a way to
eliminate the PJL and get my networked printers working again?
I have figured out how to excise the offending PJL commands from the postcript output stream. Every printer that is
added to Win 95 puts a unique file into the windows system directory. In my case the file is ibm4039p.spd. This file
seems to be a control file for pscript.drv as well as the customization of the properties dialog for the printer. In my case there are several lines that include the word "PJL": *Protocols: PJL TBCP
*JCLBegin: "<1B>%-12345X at PJL JOB<0A>"
*JCLToPSInterpreter: " ENTER LANGUAGE = Postscript <0A>"
*JCLEnd: "<1B>%-12345X at PJL EOJ <0A><1B>%-12345X"
When I deleted these lines from the .spd file and restarted Win95, the problem was gone. -Bob

Yeah, far be it from me to debunk an urban legend, but that's what I read It is true that there is often more going on than meets the eye, but it is
no less true that it's usually not what you imagine. Sure the Brits might have received credible reports that Coventry was going to be bombed, and sure the US might have received credible reports that Pearl Harbor was going to be bombed. But they also received credible reports to the contrary, and decisions were made.
Try working for a newspaper or a hospital some time. You'll hear all sorts
of crazy stories, only a few of which are true. It's hardly obvious which
those are. I'm sure the TLAs get even crazier stuff.
I do not believe that the CIA that failed to find Aldrich Ames and was cut out of Iran/Contra as unreliable is not capable of half the things it has been accused of.

I don't think anarchy is the right word anyway. Anarchy is such a clumsy
word, with so many misuses. It's supposed to mean lack of rule, but I don't think most people (even Tim) want to throw away all the rules; they just prefer consensus, balance of power, and self-regulation. Maybe autoarchy or symarchy.
I find the distiction between government and non-government power centers
fallacious. All kinds of associations make rules, which are normally
followed, sometimes punished. The only formal distinction I can think of
is that government bodies are supposed to have a monopoly on the
legitimate use of violence. This distinction is blurring again, and not (just) by the increase of
random violence, which normal folks are afraid of. People are becoming
more civilized, and no longer believe that many of the violent things that
governments used to do habitually are legitimate anymore. Nobody does
ritual sacrifice to the ruler-god-king; few would now endorse locking the
King's estranged wife in a tower, or killing her; fewer and fewer believe
that war is glorious. On the other half of the walnut, non-government power centers now have
powers formerly reserved only to governments. Private security guards
assume some of the role of the police, and corporate espionage and
counter-espionage is getting more and more interesting. "Superstars" in all fields have interesting powers over other people.
We're not seeing a net decrease in the forces impinging on the individual,

[I'm sure all the points I'm making are really old news, but the fact
remains that I do not see distributed private key escrow applications, infrastructure, or advocacy, and I think there should be some.]
Of course it will be escrowed. It will probably have other back doors too.
The customers will demand it. Most normal people don't want unescrowed strong cryptography. If they
forget their password, they want a way to get their stuff back. If they
die, they don't want their thoughts to die with them. They don't plan to
commit a major felony or, worse, run for public office, so the prospect
that a government (or someone else) will subpoena or strong-arm the keys
isn't a serious problem. I see no problem with this.
The problem is *government* key escrow, especially *exclusive* government
key escrow, which has none of the recoverability benefits that the average
clueless user would want associated with key escrow. I'd like to see strong crypto that supports distributed key escrow by default (of course there should be a way to turn it off). Give parts of your key to, say, ten people, and require that eight must concur in order to break into your stuff.
I would have few objections to a *properly drafted* law requiring widely
distributed key escrow *for certain applications*. It's certainly bad to
require escrow in two Federal clearing houses, and we'd have to think hard
about requiring that key escrow agencies be licensed and regulated. In
order to intercept my private communications, the government would need to
subpoena the people I trust, not itself. I'd feel secure, and in fact *better* than I feel about unescrowed strong
crypto, if my private stuff could be cracked by either myself in good mind
and body, or a combination of at least eight of: 1. My boss
2. My best friend
3. My parents
4. The FBI (they get *one*, and the reason is to make it tougher for    nasty non-government bodies to strong-arm enough parts of my key)
5. The California Department of State (as above)
6. The Cypherpunk Escrow Agency in Berkeley
7. The Cypherpunk Escrow Agency in the Cayman Islands
8. The corner 7-11
9. Mail-order Escrows-R-Us
10. TRW
Gives a whole new meaning to the term "web of trust." By offering a piece
of your key, you're entrusting a part of your life; and by accepting a
piece of someone's key, you're agreeing to defend it with yours (life or
key, whatever -- presumably you would encrypt the keys you're escrowing in
your own escrowed key, which can be brute-forced in several ways). I'd like to see spring up a whole industry of both mom & pop and
institutional key escrow agents. In a way, it's kinda like those silly
cryogenics people who freeze their heads in the hopes of rising from the
dead. The only way my private thoughts can survive my death, senility, or
a really sharp blow to the head is escrow. And *I* think that at least
some of the things I would normally keep to myself are worth preserving.
Sure the world would survive without them, but we're talking about my ego

Not at all, it was private only because I wasn't totally sure it wasn't a
stupid question. Which I believe you will find is platform- and even application-dependent.
If you're talking about Windows NT or 95, for example, the winsock.dll used by 16-bit applications caches DNS lookups in the TCP/IP stack itself. I think TTL is listened to.
wsock32.dll, on the other hand, doesn't do central DNS caching. So
applications implement it themselves. I'm not sure that applications even
have an opportunity to see the TTL information in the DNS response. I
doubt there's standard behavior; Netscape, HotJava, and other stuff will
probably time out DNS lookups differently. Real operating systems are probably a bit more standard about what they do with DNS lookups, but I'm sure there's variance.
Still a really interesting idea, though. My first reaction was, well who the hell controls a DNS server and a Web server and is likely to have a piece of Java that you are likely to download? And the answer is, just the kind of person you worry about.
This bait & switch thang can really be generalized to any kind of attack. Of course, it's traceable, since not that many people own or can spoof a

I keep hearing suggestions like this, but I don't think they'd work. If you
needed a digital key to grok phone records, then that digital key would be
passed around just as casually as the current passwords. Any organization
that large, where 99% of the information is banal and uninteresting 99% of
the time, cannot keep secrets. It's unreasonable to expect them to. It
doesn't make business sense to promise security, because when they fail to
deliver, as they can't, they'll get their ass sued.
I recently had a practical joker call up all the magazines to which I was
subscribed and change my address to that of the local hospital, where these
practical jokers were suggesting they'd like to send me. There is no
security against this kind of attack, because it's just not in most people's
threat profile. This kind of thing is annoying, but it can't be helped. Adding a reasonable level of security to such an insignificant system would
increase the cost of that system by several orders of magnitde. It's just
not worth it.

This is fucking amazing. In the last month, the two most well-known young

beliefs (I'm buying one of them a beer next week); the most well-known
neo-Nazi propagandist on the net, frustrated by having her daily newsletter
posted publicly to Usenet, lashes out at DejaNews for building a case
against her (she knows her own words are her best refutation); and serious
attempts by neo-Nazis to rmgroup and vertical-spam two newsgroups where
neo-Nazi movements are discussed and refuted failed without a single
spam-cancel or account closure that could be mischaracterized as
"censorship." And yet Reid comes out with the old Horsemen fear-mongering about "Hate on

Don Black, who was once national director of the Knights of the Ku Klux
Klan and now runs a site on the World Wide Web called Stormfront,
recognized early that the Internet was the place to be.
``The potential of the Net for organizations and for movements such as
ours is enormous,'' Black, 42, of West Palm Beach, Fla., said in an
interview. ``We're reaching tens of thousands of people who never before
have had access to our point of view.''
Those who monitor the activities of extremists such as right-wing
militias, neo-Nazis, Holocaust-denial groups and others agree that the
Internet is proving irresistible to those organizations for
communication, propaganda and recruitment.
In a written response to an interview request e-mailed to Minuteman
Press Online, a militia-oriented Web site, someone identified as R.A.
Mann declined to be interviewed yesterday, but added:
``Militias use the Internet in the same way other groups do: data
verification, urgent updates, tips on everything, legislation overviews,
Begun in the late 1980s as an electronic bulletin board for the
so-called ``white nationalist'' movement, Stormfront was moved by Black
to the Web in March 1995. The site is decorated with German-gothic text,
white-pride graphics, and letters urging African Americans to thank
whites for slavery.
``At the time of the Oklahoma City bombing [ in April 1995 ] , maybe two
or three racist groups had Web pages,'' said Rick Eaton, senior
researcher at the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles. ``There are
now dozens, if not over 100 outright racist Web pages. There's a lot of
new players that we never saw before, and most importantly there is a
sense of communication and instant gratification -- that they're not
And many of their online efforts amount to ``very sophisticated
advertisements for their groups,'' said Paul V. Fleming, a mass
communications graduate student at Oklahoma State University, who has
co-authored a research paper on Internet hate speech. ``Some of these
sites are just very, very slick,'' with good graphics and downloadable
``hate music,'' Fleming said.
Several watchdog groups, including the Anti-Defamation League and the
Wiesenthal Center, are attempting to closely monitor hate speech on the
The Wiesenthal Center, Eaton said, now focuses up to 80 percent of its
research activity on the worldwide linkage of computer networks where
cheap, unfettered and often anonymous global discourse points up both
the blessings and curses of free speech.
Black said he oversees an e-mail discussion group with 380 subscribers
and an electronic mailing list for 1,200 people. But since March of 1995
he says his web site has been visited by thousands more.
``What we've done is begin to break that monopoly'' of the mainstream
media, said Black. ``Anyone, of course, can set up a Web page, and in
our case we've been pretty successful at it as far as the traffic we've
``Up to now, you had a guy like Don Black . . . sitting there and
basically playing at being a Nazi when the lights are out. Now all of a
sudden there is a double sense of empowerment: Their message,
theoretically, gets out to hundreds of thousands or millions of people .
. . and they're in touch with each other instantaneously,'' said Mark
Weitzman, director of the Wiesenthal Center's Task Force Against Hate.
Groups serious about using violence are not likely to be using the
relatively insecure Internet to communicate, several experts said. Eaton
said he had not previously heard the names of any of those arrested this
week as part of an alleged plot by the Viper Militia in Arizona to bomb
buildings in Phoenix.
Were the Vipers on the Internet? ``Nope, I can't find 'em,'' said
Richard Bash of Portland, Oregon, who maintains an electronic mailing
list for the academic discussion of terrorism, and is writing a doctoral
dissertation about militias.
Most extremist-group members are ``blowhards'' who migrated from such
innocuous activities as ``bowling leagues.'' Rarely, he said, do they
pose a threat to society.
Weitzman said, however, that increasing electronic communication among
these extremists could be inspiring more to violence. ``With the arrests
in Arizona, you see more people willing to go to the extreme,'' he said.
``As the communications increase between them, there is a sense: We have
this link, we can start doing something about society.''
He said impressionable young people are the propaganda targets of many
extremist groups. ``They see the Internet as an incredible recruiting
tool. It is wide open for kids and, essentially, the younger the better,
because they can get them before they develop all the intellectual
resources to combat what they're saying,'' Weitzman said.
``Organizations have recruited through Stormfront, and through their Web
pages that we've linked to,'' said Black.
Some experts say that the nature of the Internet makes it difficult to
stumble upon extremist material without looking for it. But Eaton
contests that.
He pointed out that a Web search for the term ``Talmud'' on the Infoseek
service turns up a page from Stormfront titled ``The Talmud: Judaism's
holiest book documented and exposed,'' in the top 10 of 353 references.
In another search, the first and third of 415 references found for the
word, ``Auschwitz,'' were links to the Web site of an organization that
denies the Holocaust took place.
And an online essay by white supremacist Milton Kleim Jr., 25, of
Roseville, Minn., urges a campaign by ``cyber guerrillas'' to
proselytize in the Internet discussion groups called Usenet news groups:
``Usenet offers enormous opportunity for the Aryan Resistance to
disseminate our message to the unaware and the ignorant . . . We MUST
move out beyond our present domain, and take up positions on
`mainstream' groups.''
In his paper titled ``An Examination of Hate Speech, Censorship and the
First Amendment on the Internet,'' presented in March to a Las Vegas
conference on American popular culture, Fleming and co-author Torey
Lightcap said, ``The Internet is accused of not only giving hate groups
an uncontrolled platform but also legitimizing them.''
But the paper concludes that ``like the non-electronic world, citizens
of cyberspace will probably have to live with hate speech as one of its
liabilities in order to enjoy the wide range of benefits the Internet
Cyberspace libertarians severely criticized the Wiesenthal Center
earlier this year when it sent thousands of letters to Internet service
providers asking them to deny Web space to hate groups. Eaton said he
was disappointed that barely a score of providers responded.
``We would like to see providers say, `This stuff is crap, and we're not
going to put it on,''' he said.

Middle of the roaders? Some road. :-) I get your drift, and I'm behind you,
but I think you're deluding youurself if you think you're anywhere near the
mainstream. Most people aren't that intelligent.
Yeah, I'm sure some good people like we'all joined the militia, but I'm
worried about the losers and loons like the "Vipers Militia." When the
barely literate who can't hold a job at a donut shop are convinced that it's
*K00L* to play with guns and bombs and prepare to fight The New World Order,
we have a problem. Even the very few real Nazis (as opposed to everybody the
SWC thinks are Nazis) are worried about the proportion of unstable loons in
their midst. There are good people in that racket who don't want to see
people hurt; I'm happy to have made some friends.
Of course you're right, much of the blame for that problem lies with the
stoopid gubmint that lacks a proper regard for the Bill of Rights, not to
mention a Sense of Huumor. Absent the fearmongering, the Viperweenies would
have turned to something else antisocial, buut they wouldn't have had a
"movement" to cling to. (Or maybe they would have... in another era, they
would have joined up with the Weathermen or the Symbionese Liberation Army.)
Fortunately, and despite what, say, the SWC says in its fundraising
materials, the middle of the road among the militias isn't that kooky. Bo
Gritz and the leaders of the Michigan Militia were heard calling the Freemen
a bunch of lying scum; I've observed more mainstream (if that's the word) militiafolk distancing themselves from the Viperweenies both online and on

Since the two muslims who used to give a shit about this list seem to have

of Islam, any more than Pete Peters is representative of Christianity or
Lenin is representative of atheism." I think this falls under the category
of "the more you inflate a nonexistent problem, the bigger it gets." Yes
there is an unusually high proportion of loons in charge of movements that
call themselves Islamic Fundamentalist, but do you really think it's in your

The issue here is that terroristic actions *are* propaganda. Does every

just that the press doesn't have an obligation to print the obituary the
"martyrs" want. There's a spectrum from "the popular front for the
liberation of kooks, which believed blah blah blah because blah blah blah,
just blew up a building" to "some kook just blew up a building." The latter
is usually sufficient. If I care about the kooks, I can look them up, but

propagandize the front page of my newspaper.

It would be a mistake, though, to say that they have a clue:
  E-mail compatibility
     Most e-mail systems can send and receive only plain text (technically,
     7-bit ASCII characters). So PGP converts the encrypted information
     (which is 8-bit) into plain ASCII text using the radix-64 algorithm.
     This has a side effect that enhances security even when you don't use
     encryption. If you merely add authentication to the message, radix-64
     still converts the whole message using its own algorithm. The resulting
     message -- even though it's not securely encrypted -- looks garbled to

Pick up anything by Renzo De Felice to gain a basic historical understanding
of what fascism was about, from someone who was sympathetic to them. I'd also recommend a biography of the very influential and gifted American
modernist poet Ezra Pound, who led the Italian fascist propaganda effort
from 1941 to 1943 and spent six months in an American POW camp, followed by
some time in mental hospitals as his rants against jewish conspiracies under
every bed became increasingly incoherent, for his trouble. Like Orwell's
very complicated views towards socialism and Stalinism (see Homage to
Catalonia), e. e. cummings' anti-government pacifism, Whitman's queerness,
and Byron's essential kookiness, this is something your high school english
teacher probably failed to mention.

Actually, perhaps you *should* check Webster's... you forget that I'm a
Certified Political Scientist. The etymology of fascism is particularly on
point. Historically, it refers to the building of a military vanguard as an
outgrowth of risorgimento, Italy's process of becoming a independent,
unified [fucking] state rather than a bunch of weak city-states, which were
often dominated by French, Prussian, or Austria-Hungarian interests.
In an interesting turn from the theme of this list, Italians from the 1870's
through Mussolini saw a strong, centralized state as the best way to be free
from tyranny and government theft. I'm not much of an historian of Italy,
though, so I won't pursue this point. Besides, it came from a peculiar set
of historical circumstances that CLEARLY do not apply to the US today. Sounds like my kind of guy. I tend not to be much impressed by radio
personalities, but I may look him up.
"What is fascism" could be batted about forever; I don't think it's much
worth talking about, especially out of historical context. Mussolini started
as a Machiavellian who had not read Machiavelli. Early fascism, and the
etymology of fascism, was a nationalistic, militaristic struggle for power.
Once they got in power, then they started developing an economic ideology.
That's how it works with just about every "political theory"... with the
exceptions of Marxism, libertarianism, and religious fundamentalism,
Of "particular" ethnic groups, probably no. Ezra Pound's antisemitism was
actually pretty unusual. But fascism's essence is rabid, disciplined
nationalism of the militaristic kind. Not really xenophobic and explicitly
genocidal like "National Socialism," which isn't descriptive but was just a
name/party that Hitler was able to hijack to put his extended rant Mein
Kampf into practice, but definitely conscious of the "national character" to
the exclusion of any other. That's one glimpse, but I think it's worthwile clarifying that corporatism
isn't about corporations. It's organizing societal groups into officially
recognized corps. Corporatism defines people by their profession, to the
exclusion of any other ties that bind (religion, family, hobbies, political
views, race -- cuz they're all assumed to be of the same "national
character" anyway) and all transactions among the various corps is mediated
by the government. An excellent example of corporatism is Mexico's PRI
(Institutional Revolutionary Party), which is essentially to say the Mexican
government, which is functionally divided into units such as the CTM
(Confederation of Mexican Workers, an umbrella for legally sanctioned trade

Besides being unture, this is rather skew to the discussion of whether
fascism = corporatism = Clinton. Whether it is possible to construct a
coherent ideology is rarely relevant to historical processes; was Castro's
Moncada attack motivated by Marxist ideology, for example? But anyway...
I know you & Tim aren't impressed by Webster's, which Tim claimed as an
authority without bothering to check whether it agreed with him at all (it
doesn't; in fact, it directly contradicts him), but how about The
Encyclopedia Brittanica on "The Philosophical Bases of Fascism":
 In its beginnings fascism was not a doctrine and had no clearly elaborated
 program. It was a technique for gaining and retaining power by violence,  and with astonishing flexibility it subordinated all questions of program
 to this one aim. From the beginning it was dominated by a definite
 attitude of mind that exalted the fighting spirit, military discipline,
 ruthlessness, and action and rejected all ethical motives as weakening the
 resoluteness of will. It pleases me greatly that you do not presume to call me a fool.
I've cited Machiavelli, the historical progression of risorgimento, and Paul
Morrison, "The poetics of fascism :  Ezra Pound, T.S. Eliot, Paul de Man," ISBN 0-19-508085-8. All you're doing is blathering on with some
anti-intellectual lumpenlibertarian claptrap that tries to smear anything
you disagree with as tantamount to fascism. You do libertarianism, with
whose precepts I wholeheartedly agree, a serious disservice. Go back to
Bastiat and leave history alone.
The Encyclopedia Brittanica says of Mussolini:
 He read widely and voraciously, if not deeply, plunging into the
 philosophers and theorists Immanuel Kant and Benedict de Spinoza, Peter
 Kropotkin and Friedrich Nietzsche, G.W.F. Hegel, Karl Kautsky, and Georges
 Sorel, picking out what appealed to him and discarding the rest, forming no
 coherent political philosophy of his own yet impressing his companions as a
 potential revolutionary of uncommon personality and striking presence. For a more nuanced view, try A. James Gregor's "Young Mussolini and the
Intellectual Origins of Fascism," ISBN 0-520-03799-5. I could mail you
photocopies of the relevant sections if you like. Huh? In English, please.
[much more content-free blather deleted]
Anyway, I never suggested that there was no such thing as fascist
philosophy; just that fascism was not rooted in a well-developed ECONOMIC
ideology, and that Tim's definition of corporatism is incorrect both in the
abstract and in the cases of Italian fascism and Nazism.
How did we get from economics to philosophy?
Here James demonstrates his absolute mastery of the subject.
Heidegger only really supported Nazism from 1933-34; in the 40's and
thereafter, he referred to Nazism as a disease. He is remembered as an
existentialist, not a Nazi, though he did join the party when he became the
rector of Freiburg. I don't believe that either Hitler or Goebbels were
familiar with Heidegger's philosophical work.
The fact that Paul de Man, in his early years in Nazi-occupied Belgium,
wrote antisemitic propaganda for a number of local collaborationist journals
was not discovered until four years after his death (by Ortwin de Graef). The statement "Paul de Man of Yale University worked directly for the Nazis" is not true in the sense that most readers might think. He collaborated,
left, and started a new life. He contributed absolutely nothing to Nazi
philosophy, because he did not become a philosopher until years after the
war -- probably as a way to cope with the horrors he saw, and the shame of
his cowardly collaboration.  I don't think anyone has suggested that de Man
was a serious Nazi -- just a fucking wimp.
Where are you getting this nonsense about Heidegger and de Man? I have no
sympathy for their views, but any attempt to smear them as a bunch of Nazis
is ludicrous. Give me a reference. This is sure to be amusing.
By the way, I voted for Bush, and no matter how many times you contradict
me, I know I don't support the government's actions at Ruby Ridge. Your
foaming-mouth projections on people who disagree with you are laughable.
James, I have a lot of respect for Tim and Bruce (anyone who thought I was
calling Bruce a Nazi for holding a common libertarian fallacy must be
oxygen-deprived), but you're really losing me here.

I have to agree with the KOTM on this one, as did many of the ars posters
(after a few days of flames subsided). IMO, with the remailer network weak,
and with the posters KNOWING that the remailers were weak (someone posted
ATTACKS ON REMAILERS IMMINENT!!! before the NOTS postings), they should have
used throwaway accounts or some other method of posting, like throwaway AOL
accounts. Fortunately, the damage was localized.
For routine criticism of the cult, absolutely yes, please use the remailers,
but for blatant "copyright terrorism," be careful. As I believe they will... we're really not in disagreement here. Only the kooks on either side are
trying to make this controversial. I certainly don't think anyone should
hold any sort of grudge against the arsvolk (i.e., I don't hate myself for
posting Scamizdat 11 a few times to ars and my web page, under my own name). I think everyone but CoS and the KOTM have learned something from this
experience, and we'll be better equipped to deal with the next challenge.
We all know we COULD stress the remailer network, probably to the breaking
point, by sending the right messages to the right people. But we don't,
because we're responsible (sorry, I don't think that's a dirty word). Use

Reply-To: netly-l at pathfinder.com
Well this update from The Sunday Times of London clarifies just how much
last week's story was based on rumor. The answer: totally.  (Esp. note the
quote in paragraph Secret DTI inquiry into cyberterror
 THE government has been holding a secret investigation into attacks by
 "cyber terrorists" on the City of London for more than two years. The
Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), Bank of England, GCHQ, the
 secret listening station, and the Defence Research Agency (DRA) are
 involved in the inquiry.
The existence of the investigation, which began in April 1994, emerged
 after The Sunday Times revealed last week that banks, broking firms and
investment houses had paid millions of pounds to gangs that threaten to
wipe out computer systems.
 Correspondence from the investigating authorities, seen by Insight,
include letters from civil servants saying they are "extremely concerned"
 at the evidence of extortion demands.
Yesterday the DTI issued a statement confirming the inquiry and
 suggesting its work had been hampered by the lack of co-operation from
 City institutions.
"We are very interested in the allegations of extortion directed at City of
 London institutions which were brought to our attention in 1994. We
 responded then by involving many government organisations, including
 the DTI, the police, the Bank of England and other agencies. So far, we
have not been presented with any hard evidence from victims.We would
 urge those threatened to come forward," a spokesman said.
 In one letter, dated May 1995, David Hendon, director of DTI technical
affairs, wrote to a company specialising in computer security work
stating that he was taking the City extortion issue "extremely seriously".
Insight has since seen the evidence passed to the DTI and GCHQ which
sparked the investigation. In 1994, a consultant working for a company
which undertakes computer risk assessments for City institutions
compiled a table of 46 attacks on banks and finance houses in New
York, London and other centres, starting in January 1993.
 The list included details of raids on three British banks and one American
investment house. The documents suggested that operations in the
 futures markets had been a focus for some of the attacks.
Documents sent by the DRA, from the office of Professor David Parks,
a senior director, indicate that the agency is especially interested in the
 "weaponry" deployed by the cyber terrorists.
The agency believes high-intensity radio frequency (HIRF) guns may
have been used to black out trading positions in City finance houses. The
weapon disables a computer by firing electromagnetic radiation at it and
is a "black programme" at the defence ministry, one of the highest
security classification levels.
Last December, Parks approached a company which specialises in
defensive measures against information warfare and carries out work for
 GCHQ. For a�30,000 fee it was asked to arrange a demonstration of a
portable HIRF weapon in Germany.
Details of the HIRF weaponry and its use in the City have also been
compiled by Computing magazine, which intends to pass them to the
 DTI and other authorities.

WhoWhere? is the largest directory of personal and corporate
phone numbers, physical addresses and e-mail addresses on the
Internet.  As the Net rapidly evolves, defines and redefines
itself, WhoWhere? provides a worldwide collection of fundamental
information which serves both individual and business
communication needs.  It has become the Global White Pages and
enables people to locate others around the world, whether they
are on or off the Net. Gunjan Sinha will share the challenges
associated with building and maintaining this type of directory
and the ways in which it can be utilized.
Prior to forming WhoWhere? Inc., Gunjan Sinha was the architect
of video servers at Olivetti Advanced Technology, where he
developed interactive video servers. He was also involved with
multiprocessor and distributed server development. Earlier is his
career, Sinha was the co-founder of Viman Software Inc., a
network license management company, which was later acquired by
Central Designs Systems Inc. Sinha holds a Masters in Engineering
Management from Stanford University, and a Masters in Computer
Engineering from the University of California at Santa Cruz.

I don't have a problem with this, actually, and a brief visit to
news.admin.net-abuse.misc would show why. AT&T is selling you access under a
given username. If you send a message traceable to AT&T, they are held
accountable. I think it's reasonable for them to demand that you make
messages traceable to yourself so that you are held accountable. If AT&T bans or monitors access to anonymous remailers, then that's a
different kettle of fish entirely, but they're not doing that. The policy
above allows you to send a message to an anonymous remailer under your own

@_subject: AT&T bans anonymous messages 
This is true, but I wrote "accountable" rather than "liable" on purpose. Sites known as spam havens are regularly mailbombed, killfiled, aliased out,
and so on. With the possble exception of mailbombing, all of these means of
holding ISPs accountable for their users' abuse of network are completely
legal and require no legal action on the part of the responding site.
I see no excuse for the craven "indecency" and "personal information" bits
of the AUP, but my reading of the "anonymity" bits is simply that if you
configure Netscape "wrong" and send a spam or a harassing note, you'll get
kicked off. You can still use encryption, and you can still send messages to
anonymous remailers.
Actually, you'd be a fool to rely on AT&T for your privacy services, since
they can determine your identity based on Message-ID. Even Sameer will track
you down and kick you off if you spam from c2. The difference is that Sameer
encourages you to use his services responsibly in ways that ensure that even
he doesn't know who you are. Of course AT&T's language SUCKS. I'd like to see an explicit recognition of
the right to anonymity, when done PROPERLY, i.e., with anonymous remailers
or more freedom-loving ISPs intended for that purpose. An opportunity?
Probably not, but it's something for stockholders to consider. Skim news.admin.net-abuse.misc for messages from the respected spam-stompers
who are extremely sensitive to free speech issues -- Tim Skirvin, Seth

@_subject: Judge blocks French ISPs from connecting to revisionist sites 
Those silly French people. And this right after the German Minister of
Justice is quoted in Der Spiegel admitting that such blocking is foolish
and counterproductive. OTOH, the Attorney General of Ontario threw out all charges against Ernst
Zundel last Friday. Zundel's Holocaust-denial files are available from
pathcom.com, cts.com, aol.com, compuserve.com, netcom.com, c2.org,
stormfront.org, mit.edu, and cmu.edu (most of the Zundel-friendly sites
require payment and a password). A student at pitt.edu has publicly and
repeatedly offered to mirror Zundel's files as well, but he won't let her,
because she's Jewish. None of the mirror sites are blocked by the French
action, and of course all email and anonymous proxy routes are unfettered. Declan's list of links tells only one side of the story, with numerous
factual errors that have been pointed out publicly and repeatedly. I refer you to last months' posts to comp.org.eff.talk by rich at c2.org.
See also articles in the Western Jewish Bulletin by Hilary Ostrov and
others, which support the right of Holocaust-deniers to speak freely.
Those articles are available at:    There are dozens of articles, many of them by Holocaust survivors and the
children of survivors and victims supporting the right of
Holocaust-deniers to lie and organize freely on shamash.nysernet.org,
 nizkor.almanac.bc.ca, and  The articles on
the Skeptic Society and EFF sites have some interesting comments on the
"Revisionists'" callous disregard for the truth in both substantive and
"anti-censorship"  matters. See:  You will find not one article supporting the censorship of Nazis in
alt.revisionism or alt.fan.ernst-zundel. For over a year, the regular
posters have been trying to get the "Revisionist" leaders to participate
in a public discussion on Usenet, but they have refused.

In other news, Holocaust Revisionist mgiwer at combase.com (Matt Giwer) has
been *openly bragging* about getting a political opponent kicked off of a
conservative Texas ISP. The main difference between the French and Texas
cases being that the information on Rack Jite's web pages was true, and
the information on the Holocaust Revisionist sites is not. I guess that's
not important, though, since by definition, Political Correctness only
targets the right.

If the only goal is to allow international strong crypto using the

internals now, while there is still a possibility that they can be
changed, is a productive undertaking to the extent that it exposes holes. If the good guys can find a way to plug an unapproved international
strong-crypto module into the CryptoAPI, then the bad guys can find a way
plug in a no-crypto virus or trojan horse. -rich at c2.org

That's a new one.
Giwer is bragging that he got him kicked off for either a) copyright
violations (two GIFs of Giwer, taken from Giwer's web site) or b) libel
(no details given, and difficult to prove because truth is an ironclad defense against a libel suit). The Volant Turnpike system administrators said the problem was that a few
instances of the word "FUCK" violated the Communications Decency Act. I've
seen their mail. Their reasons for deleting the files after all naughty
words and "copyright violations" were deleted were not stated. I'd be curious to know how a web site can pose "netiquette" problems. Jack
Rite never sent or received email or news from turnpike.net;  he only used
their web-hosting services. Anyway, I don't know much about this case, and the guy is a little kooky,
agreed, but far less kooky than Giwer. We're all friends here. It just
pisses me off to see Giwer claiming to represent the "libertarian" position, and occasionally being taken seriously by people I otherwise
respect, when he's really just a racist kook.

I don't see this as hypocrisy. Hypocrisy would be trying to track the guy
down, or turning off the remailer, or filtering anonymous rants at
toad.com. I think it's completely legitimate, and healthy, to question
why people go anonymous while supporting their right to do so. Sometimes
anonymity is necessary, sometimes it's just for fun, sometimes its
cowardice, sometimes it's deception. Your point about "stop whining and write code for anonymous reputations"
is misplaced.  Such code ALREADY EXISTS. There are lots of nyms out there
with PGP keys. If you're already PGP-encrypting your message to send it
to an anonymous remailer securely, it's really no more trouble to sign it
with the key for Alice D'Anonymous. If you don't feel secure using PGP (and "the real Alice" did have some -- some -- valid points), then use a magic number or serialize your messages. It worked for the Unabomber.

Digital cash, if people can be convinced to trust it, will be a wonderful thing because of its security, convenience, and anonymity features. I'm sorry, but I just don't buy this "corrupt currency" schtick.
But it can't.
Please define "something of real value." Please explain why it will always represent the same value to all people, and why it makes sense to pin your money to it rather than letting it float.
Money is a convenient fiction that makes civilization work reasonably well
most of the time. The value of money is always set by fiat and social
consensus. People who reminisce about "the gold standard" are talking
ahistorical nonsense. "The gold standard" was fiat money too. The price
and transportation of gold was controlled by governments. The move away
from "the gold standard" was a recognition of this fact, nothing more.

@_subject: detweiling 
This is true. Without realizing it (until I took a look a the alleged
Detweiler web pages), I've been Detweiling on a number of Neo-Nazi lists
for a while. This type of psychological warfare is pretty interesting.
It's not an art. It's just being an asshole, and there's nothing new about it. the alleged Detweiler had a few interesting observations, but most of them were cypherpunk-specific.
I do see a real tension between the norms of anonymity and full
disclosure, though, which I'll have to think about a bit more before
committing it to Tim May's eternal data haven with my name atached. I should have a good example of this on the Stormfront list shortly.
I'm not so sure. I'd say that these types are more concentrated in
political activism (where I would place many political cypherpunks) nad
in mid-level politics and bureaucracies, not in high-level power
structures. The people who come to power, and stay in power, have learned
to transcend ego and paranoia. Nixon, who had been very good at this,
lost it. Clinton seems to be holding up quite well. (This is not to say
anything about their politics or characters, just their temperaments.)
Read Milan Kundera's _The Joke_ for an interesting twist on this. Or maybe _Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead_.

I just noticed this in their FAQ, dated February 20th:
     Q: I don't want my Usenet articles to appear in Deja News. What do I do?
     A: We have implemented a feature whereby if your article contains an
        X-Header looking like                    X-No-Archive: Yes
     your article will be excluded from our database forever. Anyone know if other search engines support this? I think such a standard
would be a Good Thing. Of course there will be the odd private archive,
and of course some nastyfolks might grep Usenet just for X-No-Archive
headers, but this is a good step for casual alt.support - type privacy.

@_date: 1996-03-23 23:00:26

@_subject: Excluding articles from DejaNews 
AltaVista doesn't index web sites that follow the Robots Exclusion
Standard. Does that mean you won't use AltaVista anymore, either? Interesting and correct opinion, but they're not saying they index _all_
of Usenet. They're saying, "We archive Usenet." "Well, what about
excluded articles?" "Oh, we don't archive _those_ articles, of course," they say. The proposed exclusion standard is posted publicly. Ain't their fault that I didn't read that part of the FAQ until just now.
Agreed, anyone really concerned about their privacy should be using
anonymity/pseudonymity, but a temporary hidey-hole is a Good Thing. But I can think of a lot of reasons you might want to post something
under your real name, or your regular pseudonym -- gaining the benefit of
your good (or bad) reputation, mostly -- but on the other hand, you don't
want that post archived. It's called an "aside." For example, I might want to say, "Tim May is a big fat idiot because of
what he just said." I do want to say that, publicly, under my name and
address, but for various reasons, I don't want that saved in the
archives. Since X-Headers are readable by most newsreaders, and are in
fact shown by default in at least the default install of trn, I don't
think I'm doing anything particularly "sneaky." If you (or someone else)
wants to make sure that I am on record saying, "Tim May is a big fat
idiot," then you'd post a followup, perhaps pointing out that I'd tried
to be sneaky by using an X-No-Archive header. X-No-Archive is like preceding your remarks with "Off the record..."
People and bots can heed, ignore, or flaunt that disclaimer at their option. OK, you've convinced me that this isn't a privacy thing, really, but I
think is a valid and useful thing. What's the alternative, really? If I
want to say something, now, are you going to tell me that I don't have
the right to request that you not take my comments on the record? That
sounds sort of totalitarian. I either have to create a new, unique nym on
the fly, in which case my comments lose anything associated with my name,
or I have to keep my comments to myself. Recognizing "Well, the full
context is recorded too, you can defend youself with that" only makes it
worse, really. Just thinking out loud, my thoughs being recorded for posterity on

write in conscious self-parody, especially as rich at c2.org. His analysis
of the "detweiling" attack is largely correct, but he greatly
overestimated my ego. It'll all come out soon enough, probably about the
time the comet drops under the horizon. Why not? I think it's a useful term. John Crapper's name will always be remembered; why not Detweiler's? I think he deserves that kind of

[Damn... I can't find anythig I disagree with... oh, how about this]
IMO this is why maintaining separate keys for identity and encryption, as
is done by both the MS CryptoAPIVapor and Espionage-Enabled Notes, is such
a good idea. The two (or more) keys would sign each other, but they can't
take the place of each other. I sorta wish PGP had this feature. Of course
you can embed comments into your key ID to specify usage, but it's not
quite the same thing.
But anyway, just as a tactical matter, I think getting behind the Leahy
bill, precisely because it had no chance of passing, would have been the
right thing to do (written in past tense because I'm sure it is). The good
guys would have had a better chance to appear reasonable and to get their
views on the record.

Victor Ramon Aguilar Ocampo escribe:
Yes. Apparently there's even a standard place on the export request forms
to check off "please resubmit without triple-DES support." If this is
something you want to be able to take across the border, you need to get
it from a non-US source.
You wouldn't be jailed, since as far as I know, it's perfectly legal for
you to use DES. It's just illegal for anyone in the US or Canada to give
it to you.
It's possible that some NAFTA working group has written regulations to
make Mexico answerable for ITAR violations, but I seriously doubt it.

If neither endpoint includes US citizens or residents, or people working
on the behalf of US citizens or residents, no.
Very interesting hypothetical, though. I'm pretty sure that in this case,
it's a fact, not a hypothetical.
A more complicated hypothetical: if Victor told MCI/Sprint/whatever, the
news media, and the US authorities of his intent to download triple-DES in
this way, would MCI/Sprint/whatever be liable? Any cypherpunks in Latin
America? How about from Asia to Finland -- what does that route look like?
Something along the lines of that "Pastors for Peace" media hoax, which
is a perennial show of an attempt to deliver US goods to embargoed Cuba,
might be worth engineering.
At some point in this exercise, though, we might be "raising awareness"
among the wrong people, to cite Tim May. I wouldn't want NAFTA, the WTO,

Undeniably true. I think Tim's point was more, "Who cares?  Everyone *I*
want to talk to speaks English."
One may quibble with the wisdom or morality of such a statement, but if
the second statement is true in your case, then there is no reason you
should have to learn another language. Most upper-income Americans have no
need for esoteric languages. Almost all upper-income Americans have a need
for English.
For example, *I* only really need to speak English, TCP, Spanish, HTML,
AppleTalk, and occasionally French and Perl. Most of the time, I have no
need to know C++, IPX, Tagalog, higher mathematics, German, or Java; I've
got "people" for that.  I'm probably wrong to put my faith in y'all to
write the code I use, but hey, we can't all do everything. I don't write
crypto code, and I don't haul my trash to the dump or tend to the
landscaping around my apartment. Why should I?

On the contrary, I think (undermining) the idea of state-defined identity
is pretty essential.
Note that the original-style green cards are all going to become invalid
any day now. Don't remember exactly when. Hurry! Still, you can get a very
good forgery of the new style in, say, New York, Los Angeles, or Redwood
City for $100. The problem is, you need to be a part of the community
already to be able to find out, in a reasonable amount of time, where to
get the good forgeries without getting arrested. If you have the right
friends, like if you're a member of certain extended families in Matamoros
or New York's ChinaTown, then you can arrange to *borrow* a *real* green
card with a similar picture.
If this friend could pass for Latin American, you have it easy -- just
have him or her fly into Mexico and walk across the border. Unless
something major has changed in the last six months, there's such high
traffic, and there's so many people with no or *terrible* forgeries, that
people with passable forgeries can walk right through without a
technological verification. Very low risk, but very high potential cost.
Another option, much less commonly forged and somewhat less suspicious
than green cards, is a "stateless person travel document." These were
given mostly to refugees from the Communist Bloc. They look a lot like a
US Passport, are just as easy to forge, do not require a current picture
(in fact, they're probably more credible with a 4-year-old picture), and
in theory are accepted as equivalent to a US passport. An ex-girlfriend
from Czechoslovakia had one. The problem is, most line immigration
officials have never seen one, so you're likely to get bumped to a
supervisor; but if you have an acceptable ethnic background and decent
bullshitting skills in any language, you're in.
My ex never had any trouble getting into or out of Mexico, but she finally
got fed up with the incompetence of the line officers and became a
citizen, which despite her thirteen years in the US, perfect English, a
degree in political science from an Ivy-League school, and an internship
with the foreign service in DC one summer, was a two-year comedy of
incredible errors and incompetence at the INS. Example: once she sent them
some forms filled out in duplicate. The INS sent them back two months
later, requesting that she resubmit just one copy. They were later proven
wrong -- they did need two copies.
Understand that these are the people you're dealing with.
Finally, I assume your friend can swim. I would recommend avoiding Pacific
locales where chumming is commonly practiced.

The only problem I see with this approach (from the government's
perspective, and assuming that the only state interest is in immigration
control -- you can all stop laughing now) is that the government can't
revoke citizenship. There are several reasons they might want to do this:
an erroneous or fraudulent application, a political-driven expulsion, or a
resident-driven renunciation of citizenship (usually for tax/inheritance
Of course, the real reason they want this proof of residency is for work
authorization, which means income tax, which means database. And heck,
since we already have a database, why not track child molesters and
deadbeat dads the same way. Or anyone else we don't like, for that matter.
The replacement of income tax with sales and real estate taxes -- despite
the fact that such a move would be incredibly regressive -- would be a

  within 48 hours, but it is entirely possible that an automated process
  will reenter your address the next day. They agree that this is

* They do indeed run an undocumented web spider to search for email
  addresses. Soon, they will register it on the WebCrawler page and follow
  the Robot Exclusion Standard. However, they were not interested in
  shutting the robot down, or sharing the source code.
* They deny association with the "WhoWhere Robot" probes operating out of
  Japan and Australia. I expressed concern that someone may have stolen
  their spider somehow. They'll look into it.
* The person I talked to agreed that WhoWhere's initially writing programs
  to brute-force tens of thousands of addresses out of the okra.ucr.edu
  service was improper. I expressed concerns that the current version of
  their web crawler appeared to have no safeguards against a recurrence.
* Certain other allegations were confirmed, denied, or confidential.
* WhoWhere does seem to take concerns about the inappropriate disclosure
  of information that was never intended to be publicly available
  seriously. :-)
* They do indeed have formal business relationships with ABI, InfoSeek,
  Switchboard, and Netscape (details on the Netscape relationship are not

The entry points into the system, though, have value. You need to be able
to locate and trust them. Remailer reputations are valuable. Otherwise,
you're liable to send your message into the NSA-remailers-are-us system.
You need a web of trust among remailers at the very least, which means
some level of exposure (at least by "social analysis" by observing the
relationships among the various remailer nyms).
Chaos within the system is good. Moving remailers around could be good,
provided that a service location infrastructure is established. Raph's
list is a good start, but it needs to be more automatic and dynamic --
which to me (perhaps wrongly) suggests formalization, which means points
of failure. A system whereby you post messages to a public place -- like Usenet -- to
be picked up by a random remailer whose location you do not know could be
attractive, but there's a lot that could go wrong.

about as much of the judgement awarded to the murder victim's family as
CoS has paid to Wollersheim. But I wouldn't follow that line of reasoning
myself, since I'm no fan of the SPLC. Maybe they did a good thing in the

Actually, you can be even more clueless than that and still run a

 But that requires MicroSnot software rather than Linux, and of course,
your ISP is liable to shut you down, without notice, as soon as they
realize what you're doing. The service location and survivability problems
remain. The POP/SMTP remailer idea has a lot of promise forprospective remailer
operators who are clueless and/or lack a full-time net connection, but you
still need to be upfront with your ISP about the fact that you're running
a remailer. The best ISPs will let you. I'm quite impressed with Portal
(or does Hal have something on them?), but I doubt Netcom would let you
into the remailer racket. c2.org, of course, has enough remailers on it already, but I did play
with the WinSock Remailer for a bit. It should be quite trivial to hack

How would you know that the message you received is actually from them? I
don't see how this would really help.
I like the "knock-knock" approach, though it would of necessity impose
load. If someone has an anonymous message waiting, send them a simple note
with instructions on how to retrieve it.
 From: Anonymous Remailer  To: random person  An anonymous message is waiting for you. If you wish to receive this
 message, simply send an email message with [some unique string, maybe an
 MD5 hash of the actual message] in the body of a message to
 hfinney at shell.portal.com. The simplest way to do this is to reply to this
 message, quoting this text. I certainly think that limiting newsgroup posting would be prudent. It's
inexcusable that it's possible to use anonymous remailers to post
*forgeries* (see the smoking flames cross-posted to alt.syntax.tactical).

Sometimes I amaze even myself, or whoever people think I am. This was

            INFORMATIONAL FOLLOWUP TO INTERNET NEWS GROUPS
                        "rec.music.white-power"
                        "soc.politics.marxism"
                    "talk.politics.natl-socialism"
Because of the role I played in the campaign to get people to VOTE NO
on "rec.music.white-power" many people have sent me e-mail asking about
the vote results on several political news groups on the internet. The
following is the latest data available as posted in the official USENET
news group called "news.groups".
1. "rec.music.white-power" (RMW-P)
Today, May 21 at 04:46 GMT, the vote taker Michael Handler posted a
message to "news groups" that read:
"I have completed the tabulation of the rec.music.white-power vote, and
submitted the results to David Lawrence. They should be posted shortly.
"I will comment more on the subject, including regarding the delay in
the posting of the results, once the results have been posted to
The battle over RMW-P was perhaps the most intensive in the history of
the internet and informal earlier reports indicated the raw vote broke
the all-time internet record by a factor of two. The results of the
vote, whatever they are and however they were counted, promises to be
equally if not more controversial, particularly because of the two+
month delay between the vote deadline and the announcement of the
I will inform all of you what the vote is as soon as it is posted.
2. "soc.politics.marxism"
Yesterday, May 20 at 22:12 (GMT -04:00), the vote taker Brennan Price
posted a message to "news groups" announcing that the group passed the
vote 355 to 106.
There is now a formal five-day waiting period for people to
comment/protest/etc. on how the vote was counted, the method(s) used to
invalidate ballots, and so forth.
I will also keep you informed of how this discussion unfolds.
3. "talk.politics.natl-socialism" (TPN-S)
R. Graves was the original proponent of TPN-S. He had opposed the
earlier RMW-P group but on technical, not political reasons, and he
does, as he once put it, "not consider [himself] anti-racist." Rather
Graves opposition centered on whether the nazi news group had
demonstrated sufficient interest as a music group, whether it had been
properly proposed in terms of proper USENET/uunet electronic paperwork
at the like.
His version of the Kleim proposal for a nazi group was designed, in
part, to straighten out this paperwork.
Highly skilled technically, Graves seems quite clueless about the
nature of fascism as a political tendency off the internet in the real
world. He has opposed individual cybernazi dirty tricks in cyberspace,
including some first-class technical tracking of cybernazis using
anonymity and other devices to hide their identities. On the other
hand, he has announced, for example, that there are only some one-to-
two thousand hardened nazis in the entire world.
Before the vote on SPM was announced, Graves stated he was "thinking of
dropping" his proposal for the nazi group on the grounds (among others)
that even the cybernazis themselves showed little interest in it.
However, today at 00:35 (GMT -7:00) he posted to "news.groups" under
the subject line "Going forward with talk.politics.natl-socialism after
all" that:
"The recent 60 Minutes interview with Dr. William Pierce, in which Mike
Wallace was obviously uninformed about the person with whom he was
speaking, has reestablished the need, as far as I am concerned, for a
public forum dedicated to the discussion of national socialist
movements. With Milton Kleim's permission, I will list him as an
official co-proponent on the third RFD, for which I believe we just
barely have time."
Kleim accepted almost immediately.
Graves's new view threatens additional ominous organizing by cybernazis
on the net as they go for an additional news group even before the
results of their previous organizing effort is announced.
Nor does Graves's reason for going ahead seem particularly convincing.
A search of the internet reveals only four mentions of Dr. William
Pierce in recent times. One of them is by Graves himself a week or so
before the Wallace interview. The other three were all responses to the
interview. Nor does it seem likely that Mike Wallace or his staff will
be avid readers of Graves's proposed TPN-S. Graves's decision also
comes immediately after the statement that the votes on the earlier
cybernazi proposal RMW-P were counted.
It is possible that Graves's genuinely changed his mind (as did Milton
Kleim) independently of the success of SPM and the vote on RMW-P. But
one wonders how many will be convinced that this is the case versus the
number that will see Graves's reference to Pierce/Wallace as more
rationalization than reason.
Still, until Graves's third version of the proposal is written and
posted there seems little to be gained by any formal speculation on his
motives or those of the cybernazis. Nor, until the vote on RMW-P is
announced does it seem beneficial for new people to closely follow the
post-announcement followups to "news.groups."
I and others will be closely monitoring the group and will keep you
informed of what is happening, what we think the significance is, and
our thinking on how best to support, oppose, or avoid it.
The short time line is uncertain. (Thus I am not even getting this
ready to mail until I have again checked the group when I next log on.)
But for political activists it promises to be an "interesting" summer
and fall.

Post Script to New Readers: This series of letters originated with what
a few of us jokingly call the ANOREV INTERCEPTS. I returned to the
internet in September 1995 after a long absence. Various technical
people who were anti-fascist but not activists had been following
cybernazi organizing attempts in cyberspace. They had assembled a
series of documents and analyses of the nazis, and, knowing that I was
an antifascist activist sent me copies. (Some years ago Anglo/US
intelligence intercepted and decoded some detailed material from Soviet
intelligence that was code-worded VERONA. ANOREV is just that word
spelled backwards.) The ANOREV material proved to be highly accurate.
Based on this, I started the series called "This computer kills
fascists," posting material to friends and other net activists.

I recognize that criminalizing the free flow of information is like trying

I think forgiveness, within reason, tends to have a positive economic
effect. I'm not the same person I was seven years ago, or even seven
months. (Is it 7 years, btw? Or was it 12? It's arbitrary, in any case.) I have no objection to allowing someone to become, and remain, a
productive member of society years after fucking up badly. Note there are
no statutes of limitations and no forgive-and-forget mandates for the more
heinous violent crimes.
Someone once said something about giving up a little freedom in return for
How far does this go? Do you want your insurance company controlling your
life? "Managed care" is bad enough. I'm willing to pay a little more into
the risk pool if it means I don't have to submit to a DNA test, and don't
have to submit all of my grocery purchases for nutritional review, and
don't have to be fingerprinted, and don't have to tell them the details of
my sex life, and don't have to tell them every time I walk outside without
wearing sunscreen.
OK, that's a straw man. The last couple examples show why some laws aren't
necessary. The market simply wouldn't accept a too-totalitarian insurance
company; people would rather pay as they go, and accept the risk
themselves. But why is it fair to discriminate against detectable risks,
when undetectable risks may be more expensive?

I'm sure you know the law and practice better, but my insurance seems to
have a "preexisting conditions" clause. Knowingly doing the above
constitutes fraud. (Of course lots of people probably get away with it.)
Moreover, when the insurance company pays out, that ultimately comes out
of premiums. I don't have Huntington's, but I don't mind paying an extra
$X into a risk pool for people with Huntington's because it means I don't
have to submit to genetic screening, either. You don't have to have
something to hide to see it as an invasion of privacy. It's a pool of
consumers establishing preferences, not just individual consumers v. producers. The meaning of microeconomics changes as it scales.
By "fairness" I meant that equal risks should be treated equally. Cost of
disease A = cost of disease B. The detection of predisposition to disease
A is politically feasible, but the same isn't true for disease B. I'd say
you were discriminating against people predisposed to disease A, because
they're paying into the risk pool for B, but B isn't paying into the risk
pool for A.

What they are doing is spidering the entire web looking for anything that
looks like an email address, running a dictionary finger attack on the

Peeked behind the picture frame,
Got a shock from my feet, hittin' right up in the brain.

Then I changed my name to Sherlock Holmes.
Followed some clues from my detective bag
And discovered they wus red stripes on the American flag!
That ol' Betty Ross . . .
Well, I investigated all the books in the library,
Ninety percent of 'em gotta be burned away.
I investigated all the people that I knowed,
Ninety-eight percent of them gotta go.
The other two percent are fellow Birchers . . . just like me.
Now Eisenhower, he's a Russian spy,
Lincoln, Jefferson and that Roosevelt guy.
To my knowledge there's just one man
That's really a true American:  George Lincoln Rockwell.

As many as one of every six telephone calls in Silicon Valley now
doesn't go through on the first try because Internet denizens are
tying up the lines, Pacific Bell reported Wednesday.
Under normal circumstances, less than 1 percent of calls go
uncompleted, the company said. The situation is so dire that
California's entire phone system is in danger of breakdown, a company
executive said, with Silicon Valley especially on red alert.
But rather than being a sign of imminent collapse, critics called Pac
Bell's startling statistic a trumped-up charge designed to scare the
public and pressure federal regulators into ending a price break
Internet service providers enjoy when tying into Pac Bell's network.
''The Internet is a baby and Pac Bell has been in this game since
Alexander Graham Bell's bar mitzvah. Now they're saying that in the
last three weeks, we broke the phone system? Come on,'' said the head
of a service provider who asked not to be named for fear of reprisal
by Pac Bell.
At the heart of the issue is a pricing conflict between Pac Bell and
the ISPs. In 1983, the Federal Communications Commission gave
companies that offered Internet services, and other ''enhanced service
providers,'' an exemption from the per-minute fees that other
companies, such as long-distance telephone companies, pay to use Pac
Bell's network.
Wiping out the subsidy would force Internet companies to find new,
more efficient ways of pricing that better reflect actual usage,
Parker said.
In all likelihood, Net service prices would increase for consumers.
''This is clearly a ruse,'' said Dick Severy, director of public
policy for MCI. ''They've added 691,000 access lines
this year. Business lines are up. It's curious.''

     (RSVP Susan French, SLTPC at forsythe.stanford.edu, or 723-0981)
Should electronic commerce be taxed, and how?
What should be taxed, income, sales, or both?
Who should tax, the federal government, states, or both?
Should a special excise tax be imposed on selected aspects of electronic commerce?
Is Internet taxation feasible, and how?
Answering these and similar questions requires agreement on the appropriate economic objectives of Internet taxation combined with an understanding of the dynamic interplay between technological and legal A draft paper will be available from  after May 2.
Charles E. McLure, Jr., a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, specializes in the economics of taxation and tax reform.  He has served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Tax Analysis, a senior economist on the staff of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, vice president of the National Bureau of Economic Research, and a tax policy consultant to various countries, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the United Nations.
Policy and Technology Horizons Seminars (PATHS) examine technological developments that may require a fundamental re-examination of policy, law, and regulation. Sponsored by the Stanford Law and Technology Policy Center, PATHS help identify critical policy issues in time for intelligent policymaking.

Yeah. We'd better criminalize publishing computer security exploits, too. Some information is just too damn dangerous. If there is no public record of stuff like real estate, how are we supposed
to know who owns what? Whoever's got the biggest gun?

@_subject: There's no general right to privacy -- get over it, from Netly 
Not that I feel strongly either way, but the other way to look at this is
that the current Congress likes its cozy little districts and likes
restricting the census to people with permanent addresses, which tends to
bias the figures in favor of suburbia.
I certainly agree with the fundamental points that censuses and districting
have always been important, and hence political[ly corrupted]. Anyone here
descended from 3/5ths people? - -rich

Pretty good article.
No need to go through them all. Just one record is guaranteed to set him and
his friends off.
Ray, he was talking about *rights*, not *morals*. I don't believe anyone has
an absolute *right* to privacy, but that doesn't mean I think it would be
anything short of morally abhorrent to knowingly post, say, Declan's social
security number. He has no legal or moral *right* to privacy, but it would
be morally *wrong*, and I would truly be scum, if I knowingly posted it. Rights are negative; morals are positive. The burden of proof is entirely
different. Journalists have a First Amendment right to be free from
government-imposed restrictions on speech, including non-criminal invasions
of privacy (some invasions of privacy can be criminal if the target is not a
public figure -- but such prosecutions are extremely rare), but some
journalists are truly scum. Others, like Declan in this case, get bashed
over misinterpretations and ideological flamers.

Also sprach nobody:
This is why we need more remailers, and why it's good that you posted
anonymously. The proper thing to do is to be "shocked, shocked!" that
anything illegal is happening on your server, immediately shut it down
(counting on the network to be self-healing with the help of an enhanced
remailer list), and offer to cooperate fully. Unfortunately, you don't
keep logs, so you wouldn't really be able to help (damn!).

Damn... this bug must spread like the Good Times Virus. Mine just started

Have you isolated any code fragments that might help a virus scanner detect
this problem? This must be stopped, and I think full disclosure might help.

@_subject: EAR cookbook anyone? 
We would like to distribute strong encryption (PGP, Netscape, MSIE,
Kerberos, SSH, lynx-ssl, etc.) to people affiliated with our institution
without prejudice to their current location, as the Fortune 100 can do with
PGP. Today I got management to agree that it would be worth my time to
ensure that we do so legally and publicly (though we had already decided to
distribute said software to new and continuing affiliates worldwide
regardless). There's a lot of examples of ITAR CJR's online, but I don't see any examples
of EAR whatchamacallits. Are we really going to need some lawyer for this,
or can't I just send Commerce a form letter, say, tomorrow afternoon? Form
letters my department can fill in and sign, but paying a lawyer would
require a level of bureaucracy that I'd rather not deal with.
The deadline in any case would be August 25th.  i'm back... if i haven't responded to your mail sent the last week and a
 half, it's probably because it just wasn't interesting. nothing personal.

@_subject: referers and W3 (fwd) 
A friend who webmasters a large site that is implementing referer-specific
content sent me this when I mentioned the cpunks/cryptography thread of a
few months back. I basically agree with the W3C. While user education on the
potential privacy threat is essential, I do not believe that Netscape should
violate published technical standards. There are also privacy and property
issues from the server's perspective.

The following text was added to W3's page on HTML on May 8.  If nobody else has noticed this, you might wish to share it with the cypherpunks, I don't know.
   HTML, Hypertext Links and Referer URLs
   In a vacuum, semantically neutral technology attracts meaning. If
   neutral technology is useful, commerce -- abhorring a vacuum --
   uses technology in often-unforeseen ways to build new markets.
   Over the past year we have seen attempts to create meaning for
   HTML references where none existed before. Links have been argued
   to mean revenue streams, approval, a source of liability,
   endorsement, and ownership.
   The Web depends on hypertext links between resources. Links can
   act as references, or to embed material, both of which are
   concepts that have been around for a long long time. Whats new
   with the Web is the ability to follow links quickly.
   When a user clicks on a link, the URL of the page containing the
   link is passed to the server along with the requested URL. This
   gives Web sites the opportunity to customize the response
   according to the page the user clicked on.
   If someone jumps into a Web site without entering via the home
   page, a content provider may choose to turn them away or to
   redirect them to the home page. A smarter Web site could use
   partial string matches on the Referer and Requested URLs to
   customize the page it returns.
   One reason for doing this is to ensure visitors see the banner ads
   and promotions, a site is using to create revenue; another is to
   avoid broken links when people (or indexing engines) bookmark
   transitory Web pages.
   The Referer URL can also be used to determine how to honor
   requests for images or applets. For instance, you might decide to
   only provide images to sites which have signed a license agreement
   with you.

@_subject: dhp.com is blocked by CyberSitter 
Who worth talking to isn't?
I have repeatedly requested that they block comp.os.ms-windows.announce and
stanford.edu because we allow content they might find objectionable, but
Milburn has REFUSED to do so. "We don't block sites just because some guy
say so." He's bouncing all subsequent requet from me to block my own web
site to my postmaster, i.e., me.
I still think a counter-blocking approach is appropriate. If you run a
popular web site, make it inaccessible to CyberSitter users. It's easy:
CyberSitter is the only program that understands "the VCR standard."

Yes, I'm aware of that. I don't think it's a good idea. If you don't agree
with the standard, work within the W3C to change it. Especially if it's an
undocumented cypherpunk-only feature, that bugs me.
