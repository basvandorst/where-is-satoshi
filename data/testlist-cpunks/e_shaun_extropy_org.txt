******RAY KURZWEIL KICKS OFF EXTRO-5!!!******
We are extremely pleased to announce that Ray Kurzweil, author of _The Age
of Spiritual Machines_ and the forthcoming _The Singularity is Near_ will be
participating in Extro-5!  Ray has gone to great lengths to ensure that we
will be able to conduct a 2 & 1/2 hour state-of-the-art videoconference on
the afternoon of Friday, June 15th.
Ray has agreed to speak for 40 minutes about his forthcoming book.  After
this, all registrants will have the opportunity to interact with Ray
Kurzweil through various means, including a lengthy question and answer
This videoconference is tentatively scheduled to begin at 1:00 PM PST on
Friday, June 15th.  For those of you who have registered but cannot arrive
by that time, we will soon be creating a method for you to send Ray Kurzweil
questions that you would like answered.  His responses will be available
later in the conference.
In addition to the above, KurzweilAI.net will be an official sponsor of
Extro-5, and Ray Kurzweil will be providing all of the videoconferencing
arrangements and necessary personnel.  Ray also plans to have the
videoconference taped for broadcast on the above website, as well as for
later in the conference itself!

more major reason to do so!  To register (and see other confirmed speakers),
