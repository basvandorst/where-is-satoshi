Up it to $50,000 and I'll happily take on your offer. However, I am

This is exactly the point I was trying to make. I wanted the
word "trivial" to be clarified by those who were being so vocal
about dismissing a remailer on Netcom.
You'll also need a good lawyer when Netcom finds your tap ;-).
But I'm sure some skilled hacker will be able to tell me the site and
I'll happily be out $20, in say, a couple days? No use hacking my
password, as I keep no logs (for now). The reason it's only $20, is
that I am indeed honestly interested in knowing something about my
remailer's security, and I don't know enough internet/Unix to risk
being a total sucker.
