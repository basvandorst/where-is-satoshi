First of all, DDG's claims of privacy follow the implausible general model
of "heyyy, just trust us!"
But there's a historical reason as well.  On the first day DuckDuckGo was
announced, I did a whois query on duckduckgo.com.  The domain was
registered to an address in Annapolis, MD.  A small building near the Naval
Academy.  Not proof of course, but suggestive.

anthropogenic climate change is real - dumping pollution into the
environment still sucks balls.  So at the behest of the bigmedia propaganda

Yet regardless which side is right about global warming, *almost

I encourage everyone reading this, regardless of where you live, to
contact California
Assemblyman David Chiu
.  Chiu is a the
California state legislator for the district including San Francisco.  He
is a mainstream elitist/financialist Democrat, but historically he has been
close to the Silicon Valley tech community.
When you call Chiu's office, explain the Murdock case if the staffer you
speak with is not familiar.  Politely mention that the SFPD is widely known
to be corrupt.    Then ask that the Assemblyman work to have the incident
investigated *by an independent investigator from outside the San Francisco
Police Department*.  A state assemblymember does not have direct legal
authority to appoint an investigator - but for sure, if an elected
legislator speaks out, many people will listen.
Assemblyman Chiu's office phone number is (916) 319-2017.  You can also
contact him electronically thru his official website
Some members of this list may criticize this suggestion as naively
optimistic.  Maybe it is; but I guess I haven't completely given up all
hope for our "democratic" political institutions.  Anarchists will call
that foolish; the rest will, I hope, call Assemblyman Chiu's office.

References: <576BB668.2040108
Attempting to compile such a list would be laborious and self-defeating.
It would invite compromise of the enumerated "secure" locations.
It would be more useful to compile characteristics of "secure public
spaces", and heuristics for locating them in one's local environs.  How can
we tell - without special equipment etc - if a given space is monitored?
If we land in an unfamiliar city, how can we correctly "guess" where to
find a secure public space?
On a recent trip I discovered a little 3' x 4' nook in the outside wall of
LA's Bonaventure Hotel.  Tho adjacent to areas of high pedestrian traffic,
the nook was unspied by any cameras.  No microphones or other sensors were
visible nearby.  A blissful respite from the otherwise panoptic
surveillance of urban California.
In this case we might speculatively take the hotel's Brutalist architecture
as the heuristic for finding similar spaces.  Although sometimes described
as an aesthetically "fascist" style, Brutalist architects loved to create
little difficult-to-surveil nooks & crannies in their buildings.  Alas many
of these spaces have been fenced up by the buildings' current Centrist
owners.  For example the contemptible disfigurement
of Boston's magnificent Government Service Center building.
What are other heuristics for finding secure less-surveilled spaces?

represent almost any sort of data as XML.  (Whether that's a good idea is a
whole different question.)
YAML is a lot easier to write a small file by hand, but it's kinda brittle
& easy to fuck up.  Not nearly as expressive as XML either.  Great for
small config files; imho not so great for most other things.
JSON strikes a nice balance between expressiveness and human readability.
