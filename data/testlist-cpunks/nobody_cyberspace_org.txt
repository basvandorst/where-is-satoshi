Hello Cypherpunks,
  Another new remailer anon at cyberspace.org is on-line now... Does anyone know
if one can get news postings via. email? My site doesn't support a few of the
groups i'd like to read. Can i get subscribed to any using email? I know that
my INBOX would see more traffic...
                                Thanks in advance,
ps - sorry no pgp support...  thanks...

I don't have the disk space to use PGP or to keep logs. Feel free to use me...
