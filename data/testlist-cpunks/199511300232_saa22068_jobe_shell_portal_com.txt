Yep, especially my night cleaning staff.
Not recently ... I'd co-operate fully in that situation, though.
You mean like the on-site backups that I have in the filing cabinet beside me, or the off-site backups that aren't here (in case of fire, or such) nd are completely outside my control?
Yep, I've considerred it.  It's still not all that helpful.  Cleaning staff has plenty of time when I'm not around to deal with that.
Sure. Two different situations.
If I take a message or a data tape and encrypt it with a one time pad.  And then I send the message out to someone via Greyhound or DHL.
And once they've confirmed that they have the encrypted message safely in hand, then I'll call them and ask them to call me with their public key
delivered by voice via telephone.
Which I then use to encrypt the one-time-pad, using the PGP key only once.
Then, I'm comfortable sending it (not the message, but the pad) over the Internet encrypted with PGP.  And I think at that point, I have Pretty Good Privacy.

                                  ...just another one of those...
