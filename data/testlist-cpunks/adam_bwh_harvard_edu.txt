the unlucky message sitting in the queue problem would be to store a
timestamped, ordered list of messages waiting to go.  When a new
message comes in, one is randomly selected to be sent out.  The list
is then examined to find messages older than H hours.  The entries for
those messages are then duplicated & reinserted into the list, thus
increasing the chances that a message thats been sitting around for a
while will be randomly selected. (As there are multiple pointers to
it, and only single pointers to new messages.)

taken, today, by individuals who are concerned enough to do so.  I
will use as my basis for comparison the ease of compromising the
interests of an individual who chooses to protect their communications
with the tools available to them, mainly PGP and the remailer network.
These tools are not yet trivially easy to use, but they are out there
and they are being improved.  Since those tools are available today to
those who are interested, I will use them as a baseline against which
centralized 'security' can be compared.
the right to tap phones.  The change is a subtle one with large
implications.  It creates an additional array of points of failure for
a possibly secure network.  Law enforcement agents today have the
ability, acquired yesterday through an accident of technology, to tap
phones.  That does not mean that ability should be preserved.  It is
widely known that this ability has been, and probably still is,
abused.[1] (What do you call an illegal wiretap?  An anonymous

expose an entire population of users to information leaks.  They may
be well protected, but even the NSA has had agents defect.
individuals can take responsibility for their own encryption.  If
there is no centralized back door, no database of keys, LEA fields,
and the like, then the security of each key must be breached where it
is likely to be best protected, namely in the possession of its user.
I would understand the value of my private keys to me, and not
disclose them.  Thus we have made it substantially easier to damage
the interests of end users, while not adding anything to their
record in protecting information.  This is only partly true.  The
government did an excellent job of covering up radiation tests on the
mentally ill; it has done a poor job of concealing Social Security
numbers, which the IRS prints on the outside of tax documents,
claiming the US mail is secure[2].  Only when there are institutional
interests at stake does the government show any interest in protecting
information about citizens.  Doubtlessly, accidental or illegal
revelation of keys would be carefully classified, along with the names
of the effected individuals.

`shade' is a file splitting and merging utility.  It takes a large
file and splits it into uniformly sized blocks.  It can also output
extra blocks (called shadows).  These shadows can be used to recover
missing sections if they get corrupted or it they are lost.  With a
single shadow, `shade' can recover ANY single missing block.  As many
shadows are needed as there are blocks missing.  If too few blocks
and shadows are available, nothing can be recovered.
For example, foo.bar (259042 bytes) is split into 5 sections
of 45000 bytes, 1 section of 34042 bytes and 2 shadows of
45000 bytes.  Each of these 8 parts is sent through email.
Even if any two of these eight parts gets lost, the original
foo.bar can be reconstructed.
`shade' is a simple application of the chinese remainder theorem
for polynomials with coeficients modulo two.  For more information
see the comments at the beginning of project.c.
SAMPLE USAGE
Split "bar" (111042 bytes) into 20000 byte chunks and output 2
shadows.  All these parts will be uuencoded and output to
foo.uu.001, foo.uu.002, etc.
    % shade -u -k 2 -l 20000 -o foo bar
    [001] [002] [003] [004] [005] [006] [aaa] [aab] Done.
Merge these parts back together:
    % rm foo.uu.003 foo.uu.005
    % cat foo.uu.* | shade -m -u
    Merging bar (111042 bytes)
    Got section 4 (20000 bytes)

Newsgroups: bit.listserv.govdoc-l
----------------------------Original message----------------------------
May 26, 1994
OTA EXAMINES FUTURE ELECTRONIC COMMERCE
   Lawmakers and businessmen at the turn of the century reacted
only after new technologies had restructured their society.
However, citizens today have an opportunity to comprehend and
prepare for the radical changes taking place as the concept of a
National Information Infrastructure (NII) moves from vision to
reality, says the congressional Office of Technology Assessment
   The Clinton Administration announced in September 1993 an
initiative to promote the development of  NII ... "that would
create a seamless web of communications networks, computers,
databases, and consumer electronics that will put vast amounts of
information at users' fingertips.  ...[That] can help unleash an
information revolution that will change forever the way people
live, work, and interact with each other."
   The initiative relies on the private sector to innovate and
aggressively pursue the deployment of these technologies.  But
certain problems in the deployment of the NII will persist that
only the government can address, says OTA.
   In testimony today before the House Committee on Science,
Space, and Technology, OTA released the findings of its Report
Electronic Enterprises: Looking to the Future.  In the Report,
OTA takes a strategic look at the development of electronic
commerce, and outlines the characteristics of the infrastructure
that must support it.
   To support U.S. businesses and to ensure a competitive
economic playing field, the information infrastructure will need
to be flexible and open, seamless and interoperable  and evenly
and broadly deployed, says OTA.  The Report lays out a number of
government strategies to promote a network architecture that
meets these requirements.
   The US is in the midst of a transition created in part by
advances in communication and information technologies.  These
developments are radically altering the US economy and changing
the way that business is conducted, says OTA.  Markets are
expanding globally; business organizations are streamlining; what
we normally think of as a firm is becoming blurred; some worker
skills are becoming obsolete requiring worker retraining;and
production is being carried out "just-in-time" on a flexible
schedule, rather than being mass-produced.  These changes are
fundamental and far-reaching.
   OTA emphasizes that in an electronically networked economy,
the design and underlying architecture of the global information
infrastructure will have a major impact on national economic
growth and development.  If American businesses are to benefit
fully from electronic commerce, says OTA, not only technology but
also social and economic factors that govern the use of
networking technologies need adequate attention in designing
infrastructure policy.
   To address these factors, the government will need to look
beyond the traditional role of "regulator," and consider the full
range of strategies that it might pursue, says OTA.  In its other
various roles as broker, promoter, educator, and institution-
builder, the government must establish the rules of the game and
the incentive structure that will help determine private sector
choices.  As regulator, government will need to ensure that
electronic markets are evenly deployed, open, and accessible on
an equitable basis.
   Whether in work relationships within a firm, competition in
the marketplace, or trading relations among nations, having
access to information and the ability to use it strategically
will be the keys to success or failure.  What is different today,
OTA points out, is the extent to which knowledge is now embedded
in information and communication technologies.  As a result,
choices about the design, architecture and structure, or the
rules and regulations of network technologies will be
irreversible in the short- to medium-term.
   Requesters for the study are the Senate Committee on
Commerce, Science, and Transportation, and the House Committee on
Science, Space, and Technology.

After Rishab's posts on the uses of digital reputation credentials,
I'd like to present some thoughts on how to implement them.
Thoughts on creating a Reputation Capital Framework
 This document is split into three parts: A creating a useful, basic system of service, methods of distribution and implementation of reputation information, and possibilities for extending the system which may make the whole thing unworkably complex, but also may make it much more useful. capital.  The initial application, IMHO anyway, is magic filtering.
The cypherpunks list gets up to 500 messages per week.  Right now, I
filter based on whose messages I like to read.  This is a weak system
that requires manual updating.  It does not automatically respond when
someone who I respect says "I've enjoyed XX's posts."  I think that
the framework I outline here can do magic filtering well.  It also has
the ability to evolve into a full fledged system for complex digital
reputations in various realms.
of the form "I respect Alice. /s/ Bob." *  Alice would collect
statements like this, and append them to the bottom of her writings so
that people who respected Bob would have a clue that they might be
interested in what Alice has to say.  A 'web of respect' could easily
be formed, with each step away causing some reduction in value.  The
number would have to be large enough that reputations could
spread--ie, that people could get some use out of this beyond an
elaborate name for a kill/hotfile.  It would also need to be small
enough that reputations lines do not extend forever.  Eventually, you
don't care what Kim thinks of Loius.  I would guess that some
multiplier between .9 and .05 would work well.  People you respect
directly get the highest rating, people further away lose some
amount of that respect until it trickles down to nothing.

value attached. Bob can not respect Alice 30% or 99% of the time, he only gets a binary statement. Its an obvious extension to let Bob say "I respect Alice 80% of the time. /s/ Bob." I only point this out because it is not mandatory that a system be constructed this way, and in fact, even a very simple system could be quite useful. With the addition of partial respect, the need for an automatic reduction in value becomes much less clear. If Alice respects Bob 50% of the time, and Bob respects Charlie 50% of the time, then Alice will probably find that a 25% respect rating for Charlie is good enough.  (I'm not going to get into possible variations here; things seem to work well using percentages for reputation credentials and negative percentages for disrespect.  The numbers are multiplied together, shrinking away to nothing pretty quickly, except in the case of a group of people with a good deal of mutual respect for each other.)  Also, if several reputation credentials come in for one entity, they can simply be averaged together.
 This respect rating is relative; there is no central organization to say that Charlie's Used Cars sells great vehicles 25% of the time, its just what Alice's agents will be able to gauge how interesting Alice might consider someones work to be. Someone she occasionally respects sometimes thinks well of Charlie, so its more likely that she will be interested in what Charlie has to say, at least in comparison to someone Alice has never heard of at all. In this system, it makes sense for Charlie to spend a lot of time making his customers happy at first, and holding on to their endorsements of him, because there is no time limit on the statements, and no way to retract opinions. based on the age of the signature, cause a reputation cred. to eventually become useless.  Then there is the matter of retracting, or post-facto changing your statement of a reputation.  This is more problematic.  Remember right now, Alice, Bob and Charlie are simply collecting these reputation credentials, and storing them themselves.  If Bob sends Alice a  statement "I no longer respect Alice at all. /s/ Bob, 1 Sept 1994," Alice can simply forget to include it in her list of reputation credentials.  If she commits to it through some crytpographically strong protocol based on her actions, she can probably dump it, and do business for some period of time before someone runs through all the work to confirm her reputation is as she presents it, and discovers she is lying based on outdated credentials.  A solid system needs to ensure that up to date, complete credentials are available for most people most of the time.

transactions are signed, and encrypted at the users request to
provide some amount of security against forgeries and traffic
collect reputation certificates.  A user (better yet, their agent)
asks for a reputation certificate for some entity.  The server sends
it back.  This could be built on the send everything you know model,
or the request could be for certificates of people who the requester
respects.  Such filtering might be better done on local CPU.  The
system has the advantage of carrying all information in an easily
queried format.  It also has the advantage of concentrating
certifications.  Thus you could say things like 'The well regarded
spaf' or 'The often ignored Marjorie Simpson,' because the server
would collect such data.
occasionally post their opinions to a newsgroup, and people who
respected those people, directly or transitively, would pull in their
postings.  This system has the advantage of using existing
technologies, and propagating widely, probably even past most
to lists, or send mail to folks they respect saying 'please put me on
your reputations list.'  The folks thus honored would then respond by
sending out regular lists of who they respect or disrespect.  This
really requires everyone to run some sort of filtering agent.  It has
the advantage of allowing people to set up closed lists for
propagation, and only distributing information on a demand basis.
mail for propagation, it simply uses mail as an automatic and regular
carrier of information, while a server system would only do so on
information about new individuals who may have a reputation, but
because you never asked for it in mail anywhere, or because articles
have expired on your newserver, you can not find it.  This is the
reason the server system would be useful.  Not so much in a filtering
context, but instead in a system where reputations are relied on for
various semi-real time services.  The expandability of the system
relies on part on its ability to find arbitrary reputation information

You would need a rule which would watch for incoming reputation cred. certificates (which would be signed, maybe encrypted). This would pipe into your assesment program, which would keep track of how you relate to each of the various people who send you reputations cred. certificates. It would turn all the information into a database. On any high volume forum, you could filter incoming mail into a set of filters which react based on the numeric scores given to a person by your assesment program.

Hal mentioned that the Extropians built a system based on buying and selling of reputations on a market. I don't see these reputation credits as being something tangible. You can't carry your reputation credit with you; they exist as a result of your participation in a web of respect. I don't care that Homer Simpson is a well respected authority in rec.drink.brewing; his worlds and mine rarely cross. He can't pick up his reputation credit and plop down in cypherpunks, expecting to be well respected; none of us know him. Or maybe someone does, in which case, they can (automatically) tell us what they think. itself, buying and selling it may be confusing. If someone well respected gets an additional unit of reputation, then all the people who he/she respects will also gain slightly. I expect that a system based on giving away reputation credits would work well. If you respect too many people too mcuh, your value as a link in peoples chain will decrease, and people will start disrepecting you, becuase you disturb their filter. Eventually, if you keep it up, the value of your reputation credit will drop close to zero, as no one cares about what you have to say anymore. This may fail if someone with interesthing things to say decides to disrupt the system. I'm not sure why someone with interesting things to say would think it was worthwhile to disrupt the system, but I don't like designing things on expect and oughts. Perhaps a system could be implemented that would allow you to give reputation credit in 'transferable' and 'non-transferable' forms, so you could respect what someone had to say, but pay no attention to their opinions of people. its initial momentum from people who want to be able to use it for their own smart filtering. If the system were well designed (easy to change how much reputation credit you give someone), then making a change in your filtering would be as simple as saying "slander tcmay at netcom.com +50" (slander is the working name I've been using to describe the program to enter reputations, good or bad. It came from thinking of this as a Usenet based system.) If the system could build up some initial momentum from people using it for personal filtering, then it would probably accelerate from there. As more people use the system, it becomes more useful to use it, accelerating its growth. Its growth hopefully, is not constrained by the underdesign of servers, since each person serves themselves. alterate systems of spreading reputations because the system is decentralized.  If I decide I want to build a system where each person whose first name begins with a vowel gets an extra 5% added to their reputation, and then add 10% to my perception of the reputation credits of any one who three people I give more than 75% reputation credit to, then I can implement that in my local assesment program without disturbing everyone who relies on my server.  (Admittedly, the people who currently pay attention to who I gvie rep cred to may no longer do so, after strange credits start coming out, but thats a seperate problem.)

the possibility of just taking way too much work, but has the
possibility, with careful design, to be a very useful tool. What if
Alice can say "I think David is a fanatic. I also think David is a
windbag." and she says these things in such a way that they can be
automatically responded to by software? This would require a carefully
chosen list of opinions that the system would support. If you had too
many opinions, then the system would be worthless, because, in all
probability, people would pick different descriptors, and the
information would not correlate into anything useful. The list could
probably be fairly short, allowing for terms like windbag, funny,
fanatical, reasonable, knowledgeable, trustworthy.  That would greatly
expand what you could say (or hear) about someone in a simple digital
format for automatic scanning and filtering.  The inclusion of terms
like trustworthy or reliable could act as the basis for some business.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  I.  Issues for Public Comment
A.   Background      The public meetings are part of an ongoing dialogue with the
Administration to assess the security needs and concerns of users
of the National Information Infrastructure (NII).  The NII is a
system of high-speed telecommunications networks, databases, and
advanced computer systems that will make electronic information
more widely available and accessible than ever before.  For
example, citizens may be able to learn about federal benefits
programs through public kiosks, or may receive their social
security payments through direct deposit to their bank accounts. As the U.S. transportation infrastructure becomes more complex,
Americans will benefit from the application of information
technologies to such operations as toll collection, motor vehicle
registration, and traffic routing.  This increased availability
and accessibility of services and products provided through
information technology will dramatically affect the way in which
individuals conduct their everyday affairs.      Consequently, broad public and commercial use of the NII
hinges upon implementing technologies, policies, and practices
that not only ensure that users of information systems have
access to information when and where they need it, but that
subjects of information records are able to protect themselves
from unauthorized or inappropriate use of information.         "Americans will not use the NII to its full potential unless
they trust that information will go where and when they want it
and nowhere else," declared Sally Katzen, Administrator of the
Office of Information Regulatory Affairs at OMB and chair of the
Forum.  "The Federal government is a primary user of the NII and
thus a catalyst for change.  Yet the NII will be designed, built,
owned, operated, and used primarily by the private sector, making
it essential that security on the NII be considered in
partnership with the public."
     To address these critical issues, the Vice President formed
the Information Infrastructure Task Force (IITF).  The IITF is
chaired by Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown and is comprised of
senior Administration officials having expertise in technical,
legal, and policy areas pertinent to the NII.  The mission of the
IITF is to articulate and implement the Administration's vision
for the NII.       The NII Security Issues Forum was established within the
IITF to address the cross-cutting issue of security in the NII. The Forum is chaired by Sally Katzen, Administrator of the Office
of Information and Regulatory Affairs in the Office of Management
and Budget.       In addition to the IITF, the President has established the
U.S. Advisory Council on the National Information Infrastructure. The Advisory Council represents industry, labor, and public
interest groups, and advises the Secretary of Commerce on issues
relating to the NII.  Mega-Project III, one of three work groups
of the Advisory Council, is responsible for addressing security,
intellectual property, and privacy issues as they relate to the
B.   Structure and Content of Public Meeting
     Security is linked inextricably to broad public use of the
NII.  The technologies, policies, and procedures used to ensure
the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of digitally
produced and transmitted information, information products, and
services on the NII will determine whether, how, and to what
extent digitally linked information services will be broadly used
in such critical applications as providing public information,
supporting the delivery of government services, utilizing
intelligent transportation systems, and conducting trade.      Development of policies and procedures that will ensure the
security of public and private information and communications on
the NII requires study from different perspectives, whether that
of the subject of the information, the user of the information,
or the creator of the information.  The Forum and Mega-Project
III seek input from parties representing beneficiaries of federal
information and services and users of intelligent transportation
systems and trade data.
     Solutions to these concerns will come via technical
solutions, as well as legal and policy mechanisms.  The Forum and
Mega-Project III seek input in this area as well.  Specifically,
what legal measures, policy mechanisms, and technological
solutions, or combinations thereof, can be used to effectively
protect the security of federal benefits information or
transportation or trade data, delivered or made accessible on the
NII?       A panel of witnesses drawn from the public will be assembled
to discuss the following topics with a panel of senior
Administration officials, members of the Security Issues Forum,
members of the Advisory Council, and policy makers at the State
level, and to field questions and comments from other members of
the public.       Position statements for the meeting, "Security in the
Delivery of Electronic Information and Services," should address
four principal questions:  1.   How do you envision the NII being used to provide services     and information electronically to citizens?  Specifically,     what types of services and information should be delivered     or made available? 2.   What risks and threats do you foresee in making services and     information available via the NII?  Such threats might     include fraud, unauthorized access, breach of
     confidentiality or privacy, breach of integrity, and system     performance.
3.   What legal, policy, and ethical issues do you foresee
     affecting usage of the NII?  Such issues may include
     liability, information/property rights, access,
     document/records management, legal admissibility/evidentiary     requirements, and auditability.  Do some issues, such as     privacy and open access, tend to countervene each other? 4.   What kinds of administrative or technical solutions should     be developed or promoted to address security, legal, and     ethical concerns?  Such solutions may include verifying     recipient and/or vendor eligibility, ensuring operational     and systems security, and establishing means to facilitate     settlement, detection, and prosecution.       Position statements for the meeting, "Security for
Intelligent Transportation Systems and Trade Information," should
address five principal questions:
1.   Who should be permitted access to sensitive trade and
     transportation information systems?  How can inappropriate     access and use be prevented?
2.   What technical and institutional safeguards in electronic     data transmission, storage, and retrieval are needed to     protect the security of trade and transportation data?  Such     risks might include:  disclosure of proprietary and
     confidential business information, criminal access to trade     and cargo records, disclosure of individual travel patterns     or vehicle locations, or disclosure of transportation
     dispatch communications regarding sensitive cargo shipment     routes, itineraries, and locations.
3.   What does an "appropriate level of security" consist of?  Is     there a "one-size-fits-all" solution, or can policies be     established which flexibly meet diverse needs?
4.   Do certain systems merit greater degrees of security
     protection, such as traffic signal control systems, variable     message signs, fleet location monitoring, electronic toll     collection, international trade data, and motor vehicle     registration records?  5.   Who should establish and enforce security policies?  How can     government and the private sector work together to support a     secure National Information Infrastructure?
II.  Guidelines for Participation in the Public Hearing
     Individuals who would like to participate on a panel must
request an opportunity to do so no later than January 20, 1995,
by submitting a brief, 1 - 2 page summary position statement.  If
approved, each participant will be allowed to present brief
opening remarks.  Primary participation, however, shall be during
the general discussion to follow, according to the format
described above.       Participants in the public meeting will testify before and
participate in discussions with a panel consisting of members of
the Advisory Council, members of the Security Issues Forum, and
other Administration officials.       Individuals not selected as panel participants may offer
comments or ask questions of the witnesses by requesting an
opportunity to do so and being recognized during the meeting by
the chairs of the meetings.  Oral remarks offered in this fashion
should not exceed three minutes.  No advance approval is required
to attend the public meetings, offer comments, or present
     The public meeting on "Security of the Electronic Delivery
of Information and Services" will be chaired by Mr. Jim Flyzik,

results running  NFS with four large primes.  From their abstract:
"[factoring with 2 large primes] completion time can quite accurately
be predicted...For NFS such extrapolations seem to be impossible--the
number o useful combinations suddenly `explodes' in an as yet
unpredictable way, that we have not yet been able to understand
completely.  The consequence of this is that NFS factoring is
substantially faster than expected, which implies that factoring is
somewhat easier than we thought."
that they can factor products of large primes in their heads.  It
means that there are speedups possible, but not enough that anyone
should be worrying about a 1024 bit key.
