I am writing an article on Clipper for Network World.  I am looking for
comments and opinions (that I can quote) on the scheme, its implications
for security and privacy, its acceptance here and overseas, etc. I am on very tight deadline (I need to finish this Wednesday night).  Please
call or E-Mail responses.
If there is someone else at EFF I should be talking to, please send me his
address and telephione number.
