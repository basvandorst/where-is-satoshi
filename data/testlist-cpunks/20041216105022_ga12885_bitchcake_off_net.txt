What about the fact that they're tying key validity to valid email
addresses, when the two have nothing to do with each other?  A key does
not need to have an associated email address, or the latter could be
purposely incorrect.
If this is their idea of key verification, they're going to exclude
perfectly legitimate keys from this new database.
