@_subject: setting up a mailing list? 
I have been looking for information or a FAQ for setting up a mailing
list of my own..
I would like to compose a list that used PGP encryption by default
supported a key-server swap like enviorment with online extraction
of specific keys, as the server lists are huge and PGP's extract and sort routines often do not work on them and when they do take quit long..
information and direction needed, recommended, and thnaked for..

@_subject: anonymous email article 
I had received a forwarded post about you writing an article
about anonymous email and misc. other things dealing with Cyberpunk
subculture... May I ask for what publication you are writing this
and it distribution purposes...
I have been in the "Cyberpunk" atmospherical genere for many years now,
I also am a writer.  I am currently working on a book about the government
and their shitty recklessness dealing with such problems...
I am interested in coresponding with other writers, please do reply soon
and I might be able to contribute to your efforts.
