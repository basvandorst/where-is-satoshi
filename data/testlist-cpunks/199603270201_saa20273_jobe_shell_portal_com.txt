@_subject: Bad news from Judge Richey 
Any half-wit falling for Bell's agent provocateur setup will do hard time, or maybe get popped by his twitchy TLA watchers.
The son-of-a-bitch's baiting with pigeons, no question. He's too myopic to see he's setting up falcons for gutting by high-circling eagles, who'll claw him too. Bell's going down blind-sided with his gulls, all easy prey.
