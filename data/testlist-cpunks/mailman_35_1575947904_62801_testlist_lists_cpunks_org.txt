=> SUBSCRIPTIONS: PLEASE read RISKS as a newsgroup (comp.risks or equivalent)

   risks-request at csl.sri.com
 containing only the one-word text subscribe or unsubscribe.  You may
 also specify a different receiving address: subscribe address= ... .
 You may short-circuit that process by sending directly to either
   risks-subscribe at csl.sri.com or risks-unsubscribe at csl.sri.com
 depending on which action is to be taken.
 Subscription and unsubscription requests require that you reply to a
 confirmation message sent to the subscribing mail address.  Instructions
 are included in the confirmation message.  Each issue of RISKS that you
 receive contains information on how to post, unsubscribe, etc.
