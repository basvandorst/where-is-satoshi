Do you know how much NSA employees get paid?  I'm wondering, because it
   is certainly _not_ the case in the CIA.  The "analysts" may make somewhere
   between the $30K - $45K range, but that's hardly "good pay" for people
   who are experts on that kind of analysis, especially when they have Ph.D.s.
  Please tell me how much MITRE pays you.  Is your above description a   description of MITRE?   Jon Boone | PSC Networking | boone at psc.edu | (412) 268-6959

  Now, what is this SASE?  Apparently it is either a) a fully-specified
  return-path (presumably a chain of anonymous ids at various remailers),
  b) a next-hop address (anonymousid at the next remailer that "knows"
  where to send the message), or c) some combination of the previous two.
  Is there another possibility that I have missed?
  Let's assume that the SASE is of type-a.
  Let's assume three remailers (and my accounts on them) named:
  anon1+ at foo.bar.edu
  anon2+ at biff.bam.com
  anon3+ at fred.barney.org
  Then, if I want to anonymously send mail to you (  )
  , I need to specifiy your address as normal, but specifiy some optional   header (X-Anonymous-Sender-Path) like this:
  which says to my mailer that, while the ultimate destination is   , it should first mail it to the   X-Anonymous-Sender-Path address.
  HOST: fred.barney.org  Account: anon3+
  This anon3+ at fred.barney.org account will accept the mail (it accepts anything
  like anon3+* so it doesn't matter about the stuff in quotes)
  It then strips off the anon3+ at fred.barney.org section, and re-writes the
  X-Anonymous-Sender-Path to read like this:
  It would then instantiate another optional header (X-Anonymous-Return-Path)
  like this:
  It would change the Sender: header to say "Anonymous User 3" or whatever   it would normally say, and mail it to biff.bam.com.
  HOST: biff.bam.com  Account: anon2+
  This account accepts the mail and re-writes the headers like this:
  X-A-S-P:   X-A-R-P:   Sender: "Anonymous User 2"
  and mails the mail to anon1+ at foo.bar.edu
  HOST: foo.bar.edu  Account: anon1+
  This account accepts the mail and re-writes the headers like this:
  X-A-R-P:   Sender: "Anonymous User 1"
  Notice that it leaves off the X-Anonymous-Sender-Path: header since it is
  empty.
  It then mails it to hfinney at shell.portal.com.
  You receive the mail and read the message.  Now, the sender indicates that
  it is from "Anonymous User 1" but the X-A-R-P: indicates that
  it is really from anon3+ at fred.barney.org!  So, as long as fred.barney.org
  can be trusted, no one can tell who I am, right?  And, except for anon3,
  none of the others needs to be my account!  This requires changing the
  mail agent on my end, though, and possibly yours.
  Replying follows the same sort of path, except in reverse.
  Of course, you could also allow for a Return-Path header which was not
  re-writeable, to force a seperate path to get back to me.  And, you can
  also change the software so that I initially send to   hfinney%shell.portal.com at fred.barney.org, which would *not* require any
  rewriting of mail-agent software.
  Is this at all coherent?
  If the return-path is type B, I don't see how you can avoid having the
  ID-mapping which makes the overall scheme weaker.  I don't have a good
  handle of the type c.
  Hmm... I'm not sure I followed all of the math, but how's this for
  a signature?

Is the sendmail (I assume you are using sendmail for SMTP services) daemon
  set up so that it *doesn't* log to /usr/spool/mqueue/syslog [or any other
  syslog facility]?  Otherwise, it may well be possible to track the usage
  of the remailer through browsing the syslog logs.
  This is one of the problems (it seems to me) with using a remailer and
  *not* having root access.  Unless you can convince your sysadmin to
  remove the syslog mechanism that sendmail uses, you may be exposing your
  users (presumably by accident).

Well, anyone who is the group which owns mqueue (you need to do an ls -ldg
  to show this info) can read the directory and (likely) the logs.  It would
  not be unusual for the daemon or bin id's to be allowed read access to these
  files/directories, so anyone who could exploit the latest sendmail bug
  could end up reading those files...
  And that doesn't even go into the potential access by legitimate sysadmins
  who may not care too much about other users' privacy...
  As would I.
  Good advice.  Caveat Emptor!
  Here is an example of what sendmail might log to syslog:
Feb  2 12:31:18 localhost: 15068 sendmail: AA15068: message-id= \
Feb  2 12:31:18 localhost: 15068 sendmail: AA15068: from= \
Feb  2 12:31:19 localhost: 15070 sendmail: AA15068: to=, \
I have re-formatted the lines to make them easier to read...  This is the log
of you sending this mail to me...
Here's my previous response, which I sent to the list, logged again...
Feb  2 10:00:27 localhost: 11889 sendmail: AA11889: message-id= \
Feb  2 10:00:27 localhost: 11889 sendmail: AA11889: from=,
Feb  2 10:00:31 localhost: 11891 sendmail: AA11889: to=,
And here's the list sending it back to me...
Feb  2 10:19:09 localhost: 13086 sendmail: AA13086: message-id= \
Feb  2 10:19:09 localhost: 13086 sendmail: AA13086: from= \
Feb  2 10:19:11 localhost: 13089 sendmail: AA13086: to=, \
If the mailer recieves a lot of messages, then it would not be easy (if at all
possible to correlate the messages received with the id's that they were sent
out to...).  If the traffic load is small, then correlation is fairly easy.
Similarly, if the load is very high, it might become easier -- if I set up a script which sent mail to a particular anonid every 2 seconds or so, I would
probably be able to correlate, given access to the syslog logs.  Of course,
I could forgo the logs and just look at the packets passed on your network,
but we were discussing the use of the syslog logs.
  Aside from traffic obscuring random messages, a forced, random delay and
  a medium sized load of traffic seem to be the best ways to defeat the use
  of the syslog logs.  Disabling syslog calls in sendmail (or whatever you
  use for SMTP) would be an even better tack to take.  Remember folks, even
  if I can't get root when the machine is up, I may be able to force it into
  single-user mode and access the logs then -- physical security of the   machines [as well as software security] is an important consideration of
  *any* remailer you use.
  I'm not advising you to not be a remailer, but you should be aware of the
  potential holes -- even if you can't do anything about them...
  If you're concerned with your own personal privacy, I can't think of a
  good way to ensure that you will not be "outed" from your anon-id.
  Even if you use a personal machine which connects to the network via a
  dialup slip IP pool, the provider is likely to keep logs of what machines
  have access to that pool and who their owners are...  And, of course, a
  permanent connection (T1 or the like) is a dead give-away...
  We really need the IP security -- the proposal put forward by Mssr. Blaze
  and Mssr. Ioannidis for encrypted-IP would help.. but you still rely on
  having the other side *not* log...

It seems that most (if not all) of netcom's unix machines are SunOS
  based.  If that is the case, by installing NIT in the kernel, one
  would be able to grab all of the packets that flow across that
  ethernet (192.100.81)  This includes your remailer mail.  The "cost"
  to set this up would be the risk of being caught and the time and   trouble to come up with root on one of their sun machines.  Aside
  from the obvious legal risks, there are ethical considerations to   keep in mind.  While I personally would not attempt such a thing,
  there are many out there who feel otherwise.    I won't hack into mail.netcom.com to demonstrate that it is possible
  to figure out who used your remailer.  But, if one of the admins from
  netcom wants to send me their syslogs, I'll do my best to put together
  a correlation.
  Yes, but the trophy is hardly worth the effort.  Even though it wouldn't
  cost $50,000 in terms of actual equipment or time, it might well take
  such a sum to cause Perry to take the risk of being caught.  Unless the
  netcom folks are real slouches, I would think that they would notice
  that their kernel had been re-compiled and the machine rebooted.  Good
  luck not being detected...  Of course, there is always the off chance
  that they already have NIT compiled into the kernel...

In this country you are not allowed to "encite" people to commit crimes.
  So, while I can talk about how you might go about killing someone, I can't

  nuclear weapon or poison gas) isn't illegal, but actually encouraging
  people to go out and do so is.
  I'm sorry.  We don't have a patent on how to fight Nazism.  In fact, there
  are Neo-Nazis here in the U.S. as well.  As far as I know, the American
  Nazi party is still active and has been since 1930's.  And the Knights of
  the Ku Klux Clan have been around since the end of the American Civil War
  in 1865 or so.    Yes.  I believe that the majority of the German citizens believe in a free
  press.  I suspect that the Neo-Nazi's only believe in it while they are
  not in power -- call it a hunch.
  Absolutely!  Germany has a number of problems which it needs to overcome.
  As much as I have looked forward to the day when the two "Republics" would
  once again be one, I think that it is a very tough situation for the   Budesrepublic to take on.  A number of things may need to be done in order
  to stabalize the economy and reduce un-employment.  Restricting the influx
  of new immigrants may well be a reasonable policy which will help your
  great country along to it's goal.  Do not let the fact that the Nazis are
  calling for deportation prevent you from doing some hard analysis of what
  the benefits would be of a temporary (say, 10 - 15 years) of immigration.
  As we Americans are learning rapidly, it is just as important that you   assimilate the immigrants into the larger culture as it is that you let
  them in in the first place.  You'll find that assimilation is the *best*
  defense against the Nazis.  It's not a fool-proof mechanism, but when the
  German people think of themselves as one, regardless of where their ancestors
  came from, the Nazis will have a hard time appealing to most people.
  Unfortunately, in the past two or three decades, poorly.  Not only do we
  tolerate them, but by tolerating their counterparts in the "multicultural"
  wing of the New Left, we increase the appeal that the Nazis hold for the
  majority of the population... *sigh*
  Not much.
  God knows.  I recommend listening to Deutsche Welle on the shortwave if
  you want to catch some news on Germany.    Nope.  And it's probably the primary reason why most people in the U.S.
  who are on this list are here.  If we didn't feel that the governments
  were actively trying to prevent us from using cryptography, we probably
  wouldn't have bothered to join.

After referencing my copy of RFC 822, it doesn't seem (after a quick glance)
 to allow for user+misc at foo.bar.edu -- I'll have to check more carefully  tomorrow.  In any case, I (and I assume Mr. Ghio) was introduced to the "+"
 symantic by the Andrew Message System.  The "+" is used as a delimiter
 for sub-mailboxes for each mail address.  Thus, Mr. Ghio is capable of
 having the mailbox "mg5n+", "mg5n+faq" or "mg5n+biff".  They all get
 delivered to the same person, but Mr. Ghio can set up the "+biff" mailbox
 to re-distribute to all of USENET, after "BIFFing" up the post.  Or he
 can have "+faq" mail back to you the faq you have requested.  You can
 also have it automatically file away (read: kill or not!) your mail  based on address.  When I was the comp.os.mach faq maintainer, I had the
 mail to jb3o+mach at andrew.cmu.edu go to a special mailbox which I read
 only comp.os.mach faq mail from.  The Filtering Language for Andrew
 MEssage System (FLAMES) is a lisp-like language which allows you (the user)
 to write various macros for mail-refiling.
 In any case, it does require some hacking to your SMTP server to get it
 to accept user+misc at domain style mail.  (Basically, a rule which recognizes
 the string "user" as the mailbox to deliver to, ignoring the "+misc" part.)
 Once it does accept it, then your user agent can deal with what to do with
 the "+misc" part.  Of course, the precludes the remailers from running on
 machines which the remailer operator does not have root on (or it requries
 us to use something other than port 25 for running our servers...).  But,
 in order to maintain the integrity of the log files (by insuring that there
 are not any), a remailer operator needs to have root permissions anyhow...
 By the way, Matthew, please drop me a copy of the source code... I've
 made /afs/andrew.cmu.edu/usr/jb3o/remailer readable and writable by you.

Using a remailer daemon on a well-known port (777, anyone?) would only
  result in defeating logging that is done via SMTP-agents like sendmail.
  It is still possible for the sysadmin on the host to do a TCP-wrapper
  log which logs the connection to the remailer from the originator.
  Again, this only provides IP address information, which makes it easy
  to hide if the originator comes from a machine like netcom or the well.
  Yes... also the remailer daemon could do opt-in monitoring of both ends
  of it's connections... Full accountability could be possible, but only

@_subject: Models of Anonymity (was Re: Detweiler abuse again) 
I think that we are trying to protect against 3rd parties.  With the
  X-A-R-P:/X-A-S-P: scheme I posted, each remailer *could* log who it
  came from and who it was going to -- it's optional.  But, (with the
  appropriate delays and padding to prevent traffic analysis), a third
  party would not be able to figure that out.
  I would argue that you are correct.  Anonymous remailing is a new service.
  It should have new servers that run on a well-known port (so that any user
  can start one up) and hacks could be put into most of the current mail
  agents to support using an anoymous remailer.  We don't even have to follow
  RFC 822 in the format of our messages, though I think we should.
  Yes.  The easiest way to build a reputation is to assign some unique
  public/private key pair to each anonymous user and require all remailed
  messages to be signed.  Then, you as a user can choose to ignore or
  read messages from that id.  Additionally, it does allow for the
  server daemon to reject postings from "abusive" ids or simply not forward
  the posting, but rather a notice stating the ID and subject line of the
  message, making it available in a public place like anonymous ftp or
  gopherspace for those who *do* want to read it.    The really nice thing about this is that it won't prevent people from
  having their anonymity, but it will cut down on the actual damage that
  abusers can do.
  I agree.  I think anonymous remailing should be as close to universal as
  possible.  If there *is* a way to service everyone, I think we should do
  it.  Resorting to non-service of "abusers" should be the last resort.

@_subject: Detweiler abuse again 
The real problem is the same sort of problem that one has to face in all
  public spaces.  If an individual is allowed to speak, they may be abusive.
  If they are not allowed to speak, the state is being abusive.  Usenet is
  a public space.  Sure, people have attempted to moderate parts of it, but
  all they've really done is split off from the public space to form private
  spaces which have restrictive policies on content.    Co-operation amongst remailer operators won't solve this problem either.
  If any one site lets Larry use a remailer, then he's free to abuse the
  system.  Like open terminal servers, a few may survive the purge, but
  the abuses tend to consolidate the opinion of the many against the
  idea of the service.
  First of all, I'd like to see remailer servers running on a well-known
  port.  That way, anyone could stick up a remailer, provided they had
  access to a C compiler.  There would be no cabal of remailer operators,   because everyone would have the possiblity of being a remailer.  Also,
  an isolated remailer isn't useless.  It doesn't provide perfect anonymity,
  especially since it may be doing logging.  But, remember, when the entire
  chain is as strong as it's strongest link, the chain doesn't necessarily
  need to be more than one link long.
  So then you end up with a situation where the potential abusers are writing
  subject lines which don't match the contents.  In general, you're going to
  have a hard time trying to prevent certain subjects from getting out,
  especially if you plan on automating this function.
  Actually, I don't believe that it's better.  I think that the base
  functionality of remailers should be standardized, so that they can   all interoperate, but I don't think that forcing the operators into
  a cabal is at all helpfull.
  I think you're right.  He wanted to know if Hal could be trusted to not
  give in when the "abuse" became unbearable.  Hal, apparently, couldn't.
  I understand that Hal has to do what he feels is right.  However, if all
  remailer operators are going to cave when faced with an "abuser" who they
  don't agree with, then there will be no anonymity for anyone.
  What ever happened to "I hate what you say, but I will fight to the death
  for your right to say it?"
  How long will it be before we get to the point where certain "contents" are
  considered off-limits?    Everyone needs to be able to run a remailer.  How else will you be able to
  trust the remailer operator?

Agreed.
  Yes, that is a problem.     Actually, the Mobile IP working group of the IETF is busy defining a   system of proxy agents which will accept packets for mobile machines
  and then forward them on to the proper destination.  Something like
  this would be useful for anonymous remailers.    Imagine a scheme whereby a "core" of these agents were available on well
  known ports of established machines.  When you start up your remailer,
  it registers with the core agents and does it delivery.  It can then   move to another machine.  A lack of a "keepalive" packet every n seconds
  would indicate that the remailer had gone down and it would be purged from
  the records.   Jon Boone | PSC Networking | boone at psc.edu | (412) 268-6959 | PGP Key # B75699

@_subject: Forged messages (was: TC May advertises cypherpunks as keeping your taxes from going to 'people of colour') 
Perhaps you just don't understand how headers work.
  Often times, the machine which originats a message puts a header   in that says it "recieved" it *despite* the fact that the message   was originated on that machine.  This happens (I believe) because
  the mail agent submits the message to sendmail for sending.  This
  causes sendmail to tag it as "recieved" despite its origin on that
  machine.
  Or, more likely, there was never a problem at pizzabox.demon.co.uk
  and the message is either not forged or the forger submitted it   through another mechanism.

@_subject: PGP questions 
I have set up PGP on an ultrix box.  Sometimes, when I or other people sign
messages, the messages show up with a bad signature.  Is it possible that
something in the delivery path is editing an important part of the message
to cause the signature to be invalid?  Or is my pgp software just flaky?

Isn't it true that no matter how many remailers you use, the full spec
  of the return path has to be included?  And if the last remailer is   keeping a log of all messages passed, then the reciever/replier need
  only interrogate the last remailer to find out the sender's address?

So, you use a chain of anonymous-id's to set up your return-path?
  What if you have a remailer that only assigns you an id for that message
  so that your id is equivalent to (say) the Message-ID (or some portion
  thereof)?  How do you return-path without specifying?
 Corrected.  As you might notice below.
