Thank you for your letter of support, I'm now keeping a folder
of all the ROT-13 related messagess off this echo and when it
dies down, I'll send the whole thing to the moderator of EchoMac.
Don't worry about the reformatting of your letter, I'll take care
of it before sending the message.
(And yes, I will forward >ALL< letters about the rot-13 issue to
him, even those who disagree with me. :-)  I do believe in
freedom of speech, even when it doesn't match my point of view.)
His address again:  (you needn't mail him unless you want to,
as I'll forward all messages about this to him anyway)
