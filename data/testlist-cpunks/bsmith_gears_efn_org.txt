> Password: MyPassword your request worked. Use the password you sent to them to decrypt the msg you received... I spent alot of days waiting for something to happen when I first registered, I think the name or password I was trying to use had already been used. If that is the case, alpha.c2.org dosn't respond at all. It took me awhile to figure that out. Once I selected a name and password that no one else was using... It worked...
