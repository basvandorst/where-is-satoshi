Here is my csh ping script.  You'll have to change the name of the
mailer program to fit your system:
hfinney at shell.portal.com catalyst at netcom.com elee7h5 at rosebud.ee.uh.edu
nowhere at bsu-cs.bsu.edu remailer at chaos.bsu.edu hh at cicada.berkeley.edu
hh at pmantis.berkeley.edu hh at soda.berkeley.edu
ebrandt at jarthur.claremont.edu remailer at merde.dis.org
And in the file pingmail I have:
   To: remailer-list
   From: Automated Mailing Script    Subject: Ping
   ::
   Request-Remailing-To: mg5n+ at andrew.cmu.edu
   ----- This is a Automated Remailer Ping Message -----
I have one copy sent back to myself so I get a timestamp of when it went
out.  You can set the To: line if you want, but most systems don't need
