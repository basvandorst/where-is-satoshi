@_subject: ecash trial issues explained 
: There is a sort of (limited) Freenet system in Holland called DDS, : people can request an account, (wich usually takes 48 hours), if youre
: - -really- want ECash fast, get an Dutch-English dictionary and type:
:     telnet dds.nl
:     You will then have a WWW-like page:
* ga de stad binnen (enter the city) (1)
  * aanmelden als DDS bewoner (apply for account) (14)
Then choose "lever aanvraag in" (submit) and in approx 48 hours you'll
have an Dutch -same timezone as DigiCash- account.
One of the limitations of the DDS is that mail only can be send to
adresses that are in the .nl domain, so you cannot forward your mail.
For reading your mail choose:
* ga de stad binnen (enter the city)

@_subject: Valid mail -> usenet gateway for alt.security.keydist 
In article  you stated:
: Does anyone have a valid mail -> usenet gateway for alt.security.keydist?
: I've tried a few and they don't seem to work.
You can use the {usura,remailer} for that,
instead of Anon-Post-To: , use the header Post-To: alt.security.keydist ,
(it will -not- be anonymised, if you use simple Post-To: ).
A detailed help-file is available by sending mail to this address with a
"Subject: remailer-help".
Hope this helps,

@_subject: Brad Templeton, ClariNet, and remailers 
In article  you stated:
: I might be the (ex-)remailer operator in question.  I find Brad's lack of
: knowledge about remailers quite surprising in light of almost 4 hours of
: conversation devoted solely to this topic, by telephone, over the course of
: a month.
My remailers have been used several times, to redistribute ClariNet articles,
apperantly ClariNet has an "snitch"-line where people can mail to to get an
reward, some people have the courtisy to inform the remail-operator that they have done so. I have *never* received any request for information from ClariNet. (maybe because my 5-line disclaimer says it all: the account used was an
 anonymous-remailer: so if you donnot like that, start your own !!)

@_subject: Running PGP on Netcom (and Similar) 
Timothy C. May (tcmay at netcom.com) did write:
: Not that had Mr. De Payne been using PGP on Netcom, with his secret
: key stored there, the cops would have it. (The passphrase maybe not,
: depending on whether he stored _that_ there, too. And whether Netcom
: had logs of keystrokes entered, which strikes me as something they
: would probably have--we really need a "zero knowledge" kind of
: "reach-back" for remotely-run PGP.)
Would a "challange response" type of verification do the "trick", ie
is it secure enough for passphrase monitering ?
: I just don't think the dangers are worth it. All the theoretical hot
: air about whether kestroke timings are "random enough" is moot if
: Netcom is turning over records to investigators.

@_subject: cancelling a message 
In article  you did write:
: Someone in here recently mentioned cancelling a post on USENET. It's been : put to my knowledge that this is possible, but I have never known what it : actually means and how it is done. Whose messages can I cancel(anyone's : on the whole worldwide I-net or?) and how do I cancel them? If it helps : any, I use the Tin Pl12 newsreader. Any replies are welcome. Please fill : me in on this one. Thank you.
Check the control newsgroup for the exact format of canceld messages,
you can fake a cancelmessage the same way as faking a post:
