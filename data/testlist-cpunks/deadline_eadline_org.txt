@_subject: [Beowulf] High Performance SSH/SCP 
Just saw this mentioned on Slashdot.
High Performance SSH/SCP - HPN-SSH
The internal flow control buffers in openssh are small
and static. The guys at Pittsburgh SC have created a
patch that can be applied to openssh that dynamically increases
the buffers which dramatically improves performance. They
also multi-threaded the crypto. So if you were wondering
about what to do with that extra core, now you have your
Beowulf mailing list, Beowulf at beowulf.org
