If I want to keep secret the details of something I make, it is my right

Don't like it? Don't fucking buy it.
Any communist maggots that murder, or attempt to murder people for merely
keeping secret the details of the stuff they make and sell should be bound,
gagged, tortured, then taken out back to have their skulls crushed with a
sledgehammer until their brains start oozing out their ears.
