Police to pay Vodafone $1m to
                  tap criminals
                  22 FEBRUARY 2001
                  Vodafone customers will no longer escape
                  surveillance after police complete a deal with the
                  mobile phone company that will allow them to tap
                  into digital phones.
                  It was revealed yesterday that police sought $1.1
                  million from the Government to pay Vodafone to help
                  them track calls.
                  Communications Minister Paul Swain said last night
                  that police had already been allocated the money for
                  the deal, expected to be completed in a few weeks.
                  The Crimes Act allows police to intercept all phone
                  calls, but police cannot decode the Vodafone digital
                  network, which uses encryption technology.
                  Mr Swain said New Zealand lagged behind other
                  countries that made it compulsory for all
                  telecommunications companies to be able to be
                  intercepted by police.
                  Policy considerations were being examined that would
                  make it compulsory for all telecommunications
                  providers to use networks that could be intercepted by
                  police.
                  "This would mean that if new telecommunications
                  companies came on the scene they would have to fit
                  the bill if they were using a network that could not
                  intercepted," Mr Swain said.
                  Police Association president Greg O'Connor questioned
                  yesterday why police should have to pick up the bill
                  the cost.
                  "In the United States and in Australia, the providers
                  have to provide access to the police and other
                  to be able to tap phones," Mr O'Connor said.
                  "In New Zealand it doesn't happen. In New Zealand
                  the telecommunications companies are creaming it off
                  police."
                  An amendment to the Crimes Act already allowed
                  police to intercept electronic communications,
                  police needed to produce and enforce search warrants
                  in order to get information from phone companies.
                  According to police papers, last year police also paid
                  Telecom to enable them to tap their phones.
                  The issue was similar to one raised last year about a
                  $250,000 annual bill police received from Vodafone for
                  doing searches. "The reason we (the association)
                  talk about tapping digital phones until now was
                  because we didn't want to alert the criminals to the
                  fact that we couldn't do it," Mr O'Connor said.
                  Police national crime manager Bill Bishop said police
                  were still discussing possible legislation with
                  government. Police would not comment on their ability
                  to intercept electronic communications.

Beware Those Insidious Vcards
           by Michelle Delio
           10:00 a.m. Feb. 23, 2001 PST
           Those little virtual business cards that some people attach
to their
           e-mails might be dangerous.
           Microsoft announced Friday that a flaw in its Outlook e-mail
           allows crackers to crash or remotely control computers and
           networks, via virtual business cards (Vcards) that harbor
           code.
    Vcards containing malformed data can cause any
                           action of the attacker's choice to run on the
                           recipient's machine or a network when a
                           recipient opens them. They can add, change or
                           delete data, communicate with websites,
reformat a
                           hard drive, and more.
                           The flaw is located in the segment of the
                           program that processes Vcards. Microsoft says
                           damage would be limited only by the security
                           permissions a user has set on his or her
                           "Since most people, especially those who
                           backed by a decent security department,
                           leave their machines wide open to any
                           breaches, I'd say there's a lot of fun to be
                           here," said Andrew Antipass, a security
                           for TechServe.
                           Ollie Whitehouse, managing security architect
                            is credited for discovering the flaw,
                           Whitehouse reported to Microsoft in November
                           2000.
                           "Microsoft's reaction, as always in these
                           was professional. We worked with them to help
                           them replicate the vulnerability. They in
                           developed a patch which they sent to us for
                           additionally they coordinated with us the
release of
                           their advisory and our own," Whitehouse said.
                           Typically, when a flaw is discovered that is
                           widely known and therefore doesn't seem to be
                           immediate threat, the software company and
                           discoverer of the flaw will avoid making
                           announcements until a patch has been
                           Once the announcement has been made, it is
                           for users to apply the patch, as attackers
would then
                           be aware of the flaw and will seek to exploit
                           Microsoft has released a patch and advises
                           who uses Outlook to download and install the
                           immediately.
                           Whitehouse said that this particular
                           flaw is not uncommon in Microsoft's products.
                           Atstake has discovered a number of similar
                           vulnerabilities in Microsoft products from
                           to Media Player.
                           Outlook 97 and 2000 and Outlook Express 5.01
                           5.5 contain the "Unchecked Buffer" flaw. An
                           can exploit the flaw by creating a Vcard, and
                           altering it with a hexadecimal editor to
include a
                           long string of data.
                           Normally, when a program's buffer is overrun
                           random data, the application would simply
lock up
                           or crash. But due to that flaw in Outlook's
                           flooding it with data by way of a Vcard can
                           magically transform the e-mail program into a
                           compliant slave of the cracker, allowing him
or her
                           to make Outlook act as a sort of remote
control over
                           the affected machine.
                           If a vicious Vcard were opened on a machine
                           user was connected to an unsecured network,
or if
                           the affected machine were configured to allow
                           control over a network, the attacker could
                           anything that is connected to that network.
                           Essentially, the attacker would be a ghost in
                           machine, with all the rights and privileges
                           machine's user has.
                           The card does have to be opened to be
                           said Microsoft, and there is no way that it
can be
                           coded to open automatically.
                           "So the attacker would need to entice the
                           into opening the mail, then opening the
                           Microsoft said in its security bulletin.
                           Unfortunately, given the wide and fast spread
                           recent viruses like Anna and the Love Bug, it
                           take much enticing to get computer users to
                           and click on attachments.
                           And "for reasons that are beyond my mortal
                           to figure out," many people don't consider
Vcards to
                           be an attachment, said Antipass.
                           Microsoft plans to issue a full security
bulletin on the
                           Vcard problem late Friday.

criminal charges Thursday by the state
                                                 attorney general.
                                                      The killing of
Alberto Sepulveda was an accident, and
                                                 there was no that
evidence Modesto Officer David Hawn
                                                 intended to kill the
boy, said Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer.
                                                      The boy was lying
face down on his bedroom floor

                                                      The Sept. 13 raid
was part of a countywide effort to
                                                 crack down on a
methamphetamine drug ring. The boy's

Sepulveda Sr., was arrested on charges of
                                                 conspiracy to
distribute the drug.
                                                      Lockyer said the
impact of the killing was devastating
                                                 and compelled him to

                                            top-secret overseas
eavesdropping devices are placed,
                                            officials say.

                                                 WASHINGTON--U.S.
intelligence officials said
                                            Tuesday that they fear
suspected spy Robert Philip
                                            Hanssen may have provided
Russia with top-secret
                                            information about how and
where the United States has
                                            planted its most
sophisticated overseas eavesdropping
                                            devices.
                                                 U.S. spy-catchers said
they are trying to determine
                                            whether the former FBI agent
compromised a highly
                                            sensitive "black-budget"
program run jointly by the
                                            Central Intelligence Agency
and the National Security
                                            Agency.
                                                 The elite program,
known innocuously as the Special
                                            Collection Service, plays a
critical role in U.S.
                                            intelligence operations by
conducting bugging operations
                                            in or near embassies,
communications centers and other
                                            facilities on foreign soil.
                                                 The program's mission
is so sensitive that intelligence
                                            officials never have
acknowledged its existence publicly.
                                            Its funding is hidden within
the federal budget and little is
                                            known about the technologies
and techniques it employs.
                                                 Hanssen was arrested on
Feb. 18 after FBI agents said
                                            they saw him leave a cache
of secret documents at a "dead
                                            drop" in a park near his
home in Vienna, Va. He is
                                            accused of having provided
classified material to the
                                            Russians since 1985 in
exchange for $1.4 million in cash
                                            and diamonds.
                                                 According to documents
filed in federal court
                                            Tuesday, the package of
material included an encrypted
                                            letter in which Hanssen said
that he feared the FBI
                                            suspected him and that he
needed to "seclude" himself.
                                                 "Something has aroused
the sleeping tiger," said a
                                            letter signed by "Ramon
Garcia," one of the aliases
                                            allegedly used by Hanssen.
The letter said that the FBI had
                                            promoted him to "a higher
do-nothing" job without
                                            regular access to
counterintelligence. "It is as if I am
                                            being isolated," the letter
                                                 As U.S. officials try
to assess the damage caused by
                                            Hanssen's alleged spying,
the CIA-NSA bugging program
                                            "is going to be a focus,"
confirmed an intelligence official
                                            who asked not to be
identified. "That's certainly going to
                                            be looked at."
                                                 Hanssen is believed to
have shared office quarters for
                                            several years at the State
Department with NSA agents
                                            and may have obtained
information about the bugging
                                            program through this and
other means in his role as a
                                            Russian counterintelligence
specialist, U.S. officials said.
                                                 If Hanssen did breach
the security of the program, it
                                            could represent one of the
most damaging consequences
                                            of the data he allegedly
sold to the Russians and their
                                            Soviet predecessors over a
15-year period.
                                                 An affidavit outlining
the government's case against
                                            Hanssen asserts that he
"compromised an entire technical
                                            program of enormous value,
expense and importance to
                                            the United States." It
suggests obliquely that Hanssen
                                            gave the Russians
information about a "new technique"
                                            developed by the NSA and
described to them a "sensitive
                                            office" where an NSA
employee worked.
                                                 Although the affidavit
does not mention the Special
                                            Collection Service by name,
intelligence experts outside
                                            the government said that
these and other references point
                                            to the global eavesdropping
                                                 FBI officials already
have described some of the
                                            information they believe
Hanssen passed to the Russians
                                            over the years. He allegedly
confirmed for Moscow the
                                            identities of three Russian
double agents who were
                                            working for the United
States--leading to the execution of
                                            two of them. And in 1989, he
allegedly let the KGB know
                                            about a secret FBI
investigation into the activities of
                                            Felix Bloch, a high-ranking
U.S. diplomat suspected of
                                            spying for the Soviets. The
investigation was
                                            "compromised," U.S.
officials said, and Bloch was never
                                            charged.
                                                 But intelligence
officials said that Hanssen may have
                                            caused far more damage to
U.S. national security, and
                                            they are still trying to
assess the extent of that damage.
                                            FBI Director Louis J. Freeh,
along with Atty. Gen. John
                                            Ashcroft and CIA Director
George J. Tenet, will brief
                                            congressional officials
today in a closed session.
                                                 If the bugging program
was seriously compromised by
                                            Hanssen, "that's something
that would be extremely
                                            serious," said a former
intelligence official who requested
                                            anonymity. "You're talking
about very specific, very
                                            pointed information that's
usually the gold nuggets of the
                                            intelligence community."
                                                 Said James Bamford, an
author and expert on the
                                            NSA: "Once [the Russians]
find out how this
                                            eavesdropping is done and
where in essence the bugs are,
                                            they could quickly do one of
two things--take them apart,
                                            or worse yet, send
disinformation over them."
                                                 Intelligence officials
started the program in the late
                                            1970s in the midst of the
Cold War to devise and plant
                                            sophisticated eavesdropping
devices at overseas sites that
                                            have access to sensitive
data. The aim is to intercept
                                            sensitive information on
espionage, nuclear arms,
                                            terrorist networks, drug
trafficking and a range of other
                                            issues that U.S. officials
say are vital to national security.
                                                 The bugging program
"marries the CIA's covert people
                                            who know how to get into
places--by bribing the right
                                            person or whatever is
needed--with the NSA people who
                                            can design the right bug to
go in the right environment so
                                            the information can be
secreted across the border," said
                                            Bamford, who wrote a
landmark study of the NSA and
                                            will soon release a sequel
called "Body of Secrets."
                                                 The CIA and the NSA use
the program to bug not only
                                            obvious targets such as
embassies and government
                                            centers, but also computer
facilities, fiber-optic cable
                                            networks and communications
centers carrying sensitive
                                            data, Bamford said.
                                                 Bamford said that he
knows Hanssen well, both
                                            personally and
professionally. Hanssen, he said, was in an
                                            ideal position to penetrate
the bugging system because he
                                            was intimately familiar with
Russian counterintelligence,
                                            computers and sophisticated
electronic eavesdropping
                                            techniques. "Those are
exactly the kinds of things that
                                            [Special Collection Service]
is involved in," he said.

Hacker snags U.S. satellite
          software, codes
          By Robert Lemos CNET News.com
          An international investigation has turned up evidence that a
hacker stole
          source code for classified software used by the U.S. Defense
          to control satellites and guide rockets.
                           Law enforcement searched the servers of
                           consultant Carbonide on Feb. 6 on suspicion
that a
                           hacker used the company's Freebox Web e-mail
                           service to distribute the source code to
others, said
                           Erik Wickbom, CEO of the Stockholm,
                           Sweden-based Carbonide.
                           "We didn't know it was there, and we didn't
know it
                           was source code," he told CNET News.com on
          Friday.
          Although the search occurred nearly a month ago, it did not
become public
          until Friday.
          After the four-hour search, the team of Swedish law
enforcement and FBI
          computer experts left with copies of the evidence.
"Immediately after, we
          deleted the source code," Wickbom said.
          The source code was part of a software program known as
          which is used by the military to control satellites and
rockets, Reuters
          reported Friday.
          The U.S. Air Force has plans to use the software to control
the NAVSTAR
          Global Positioning System from its Colorado Springs Monitor
          which is part of the Air Force Space Command, according to a
          press release from the software's creator, Exigent Software
          The source code appears to have been stolen from the U.S.
Naval Research
          Laboratory in Washington D.C. on Dec. 24. The military
detected the
          intrusion three days later, Reuters reported.
          The FBI would not comment on the theft or the investigation.
          The stolen source code is apparently a fragment of the
          application. That's because Wickbom said law enforcement
official could
          fit the data on a single floppy disk, about 1.44MB of space.
          Although the hacker had used the name "Leeif" on the system,
          said the account was stolen. Wickbom added that the trail
          points to a German university as the source of the intrusion
