it sends a message to ZKS.  EVERY time.  How, again, is this not "tracking"
of my usage behaviour?  How is ZKS knowing every time I boot up that I've
got Freedom 3.0 installed not something they can build a profile about?

sends a request, info I don't have a clue about (And those cookies, when

between my computer and zeroknowledge.com that I'm using freedom.  Which,
of course, is covered by the Pen trace and trap warrants, and is collected
by carnivore.  Now I'm telling my ISP and the world what my IP is, what
my platform is, and that I use Freedom.
