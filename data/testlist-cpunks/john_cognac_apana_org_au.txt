Adam Back:
You may want to check out alt.sysadmin.recovery; they use the moderation mechanism to produce a group that is unmoderated, but spam-resistant.  It would be impolite to describe the technique,
but it should be apparent if you browse a few articles.
Another way to avoid crossposts is to have a robomoderated group,
where a bot automatically rejects articles which are crossposted,
and approves all others.
7. Usenet traffic, at least in remote regions (looks around), is often    assigned less bandwidth/lower priority than mail, so a reader may
   not see all of the messages (AFAICT, I normally see about half or    less of what actually gets posted to the groups I read), even if the    group is "well propagated".

If you think so, you may wish to consider filing an FOIA request for the Mykotronix stuff, and see if it mentions cypherpunks; it could provide an interesting perspective on their response.

It's not quite that simple.  While a "Big 7" group requires CFD, charter
and voting, once you pass tthose hurdles you're virtually guaranteed good
propagation.  alt has no "set" creartion procedure, but your group will
not receive good propagation unless the powers that be "approve" of the In this case, the people you have to convince are the news admins who must
permit your control message to be honoured; time was most sites ran on
autopilot, but joke and badly-named groups mean that most news admins
now drop most newgroup messages on the floor.  These people hang out in
alt.config, and you should propose the group's creation there, followed
by a couple of weeks of discussion, hopefully featuring many more supportive messages than non-supportive ones.  After that, a newgroup message stands a much better chance.
Hip hip,
