July 2nd 2001. I fled my war torn country to Nigeria
for my dear life.

mining corporation where he misappropriated sum of
US$40 million he secretly deposited as family

Abidjan. This misappriopriated money were Synthetically packed into 2boxes of weight 21kg each.
But for my knowledge about this deal I made a swift

president office before he was killed. Amongst

deposit issued Erim by the security Company. Besides, I have lost every property,
