John Krezner points out that EFF's crypto statement says
    *    There must be no broadening of governmental access to private
Jerry Berman responds:
NO. NO NO Thanks for pointing this out. I am sure our board will move to
amend the section to state our intent with the following words: "broadened
access, provided it is consistent with the Constitution and the Bill of
rights" or some such formulaton.
