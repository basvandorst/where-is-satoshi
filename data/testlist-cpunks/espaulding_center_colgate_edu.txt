@_subject: PGP compilation problems on vax 
PGP 2.3 on our vax without a fuss.  Then we switched over to
a happy alpha vax, and all my jolly executables went the way of the
dustbunny.  My problem is this:  neither 2.6 nor 2.3 code will compile
on my alpha, apparently because the function hashpass is undefined.
Anyone have an easy remedy they can email me?
