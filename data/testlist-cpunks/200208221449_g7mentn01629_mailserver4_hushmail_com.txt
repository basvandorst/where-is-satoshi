U.S. Military Uses the Force
By Noah Shachtman
One of the most dangerous and pervasive threats facing American and
British troops in combat zones is a primitive grenade launcher that only
sets your typical terrorist back about $10.
The Anglo-American defense against this no-tech threat: an electrical
force field that's costing hundreds of millions of dollars to develop.
Fitted on light armored vehicles such as personnel carriers, the force
field uses a series of charged metal plates to dissipate the effects of
rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), a weapon found by the thousands from
Mogadishu to Kabul to Baghdad.
