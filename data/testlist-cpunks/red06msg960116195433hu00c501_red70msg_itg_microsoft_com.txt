To expand a bit:
I don't remember if it was a lieutenant, captain, or whatever, but he passed out the questionnaire in futherance of his master's degree in something or other. One question dealt with shooting civilians who disobeyed orders to turn over their arms, even if they were owned under what would now be considered legal circumstances. Shockingly, upwards of 25% of the soldiers (Marines, actually, as I remember it, I'll check my references if anyone wants) would have no problem doing so! This in spite of the fact that officers in the armed forces (not sure about enlisted men, but I believe it's true of them as well) swear an oath to uphold the Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic - and I think that under the Constitution as it is now, forcibly depriving people of their arms would probably be a reasonable basis for considering them in contravention of the Constitution, and therefore enemies of it.

The notorious questionaire to the SEALS wasn't an official action. It was one lieutenient doing an assignment for a night class.
