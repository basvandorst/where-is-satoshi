*The EW Octagon: *
*A way to test Cognitive EW*

Marine EA-6B Electronic Countermeasures Officer, flight instructor at
VT-86, *Major Kenneth "Beldar" Hollinger.*
*About the Webinar:*
The ability to transmit and receive information to and from nodes on the
battlefield can be the key to winning or losing a fight. The EMS is the
information pathway of choice in any kind of maneuver warfare. With the
exponential increase of sensors on the battlefield, we are quickly running
out of maneuver space within the EMS. It is not hard to imagine a scenario
where a contest between two adversaries is won or lost solely from the
ability to dominate the EMS. The side with EMS dominance will be able to
see the battlefield and communicate-while the other side will be rendered
blind and dumb.
In a contested EMS environment, what is the best strategy to guarantee use
of the EMS while denying the enemy the same? Assuming an equal power
budget, what strategy will give you the correct mix of sensing,
transmitting, jamming, bit checking, and processing to maximize the delta
between you and your enemy's ability to make use of the EMS?
As strategies and theories for EMS dominance are developed it will be
necessary to establish a proving ground in which to test them.
*What is the "EW Octagon"?:*
*A concept to create an environment to facilitate the maturation of
'Cognitive EW' -or the ability to autonomously sense and react to what the
enemy is doing and dominate the EMS.*
The idea is to force two opposing Cognitive EW RF systems to operate within
a contested RF band in order to test and develop Cognitive EW strategies.
Furthermore, force the systems to operate with a restricted amount of power
and enough RF bandwidth to maneuver, but not more bandwidth than each
system could take full advantage of. In other words, the 'Octagon' is a set
of contest rules, and a contest environment, crafted properly in order to
facilitate 'a good fight'.
The 'EW Octagon' is a concept that could be a useful tool for developing
strategies and technologies that will allow us to maintain EMS dominance in
a future, contested EMS environment.

@_subject: cyberwarfare by lawyers 
References: A few comments regarding both articles.
There is nothing that is new in either pieces. There is alot of fluff and
Israeli self promotion in both - in that sense I see both articles as a
form of psyops. Regarding Afek's "groundbreaking" thesis - bullshit.
Perhaps in Hebrew it is unique, but the legal aspects of cyberwar have been
researched and discussed in many forums. The Tallinn document of the EU for
example. International relations theory, political science and legal
theory, within academia and the military have been dealing with this for
years. For example, serious treatment of the concept of "just war" in cyber
As a senior legal officer in the IDF, Afek is directly responsible, at the
macro level, for whitewashing the Israeli occupation of Palestine, and at
the micro level legalizing Israeli crimes against Palestinians. Exactly the
kind of person you would want to draft a thesis on cyberwar. Not.
One can google Saalbach, or Thomas Ridd as a start regarding a more serious
discussion of cyberwar.
