perhaps the scale larger than the highest layer nodes is no longer
recognisable as being part of the fractal.
Likewise the nodes at each ppp have some organization as to how they handle
data internaly.
The shape of a shoreline is often used to illustrate fractal self
similarity, but you quickly reach a point where it is hard to call it a
shoreline anymore, it becomes grains of sand, pebbles, or boulders.
So say you -could- estimate a fractal dimension for the internet. What would
the number be good for?

Could you explain 'saturated'?
I am not sure this isn't related to a more simple surface - to - volume type
number, but I only have three or so hands to wave at the difference.
How about the average number of links to get to a destination vs the total
network size? Plot that the way you would Minkowski sausage volume vs
diameter to get fractal dimension. I saw an article pointing out that the
average number of links was not growing as fast as the network size would
predict, and blaming the expert and portal type sites for the difference.
That is a cypherpunkish type observation, it is a number indicating
intelligient intervention in the organization of the network.

The suits are in the court before the certifiying deadline. They then have
all the authority in the world.
To not let the certification process complete itself tomorrow certainly is not good for the Bush camp. And I do believe Miss Secretary of State will wish she
has not done what she has so far. She in her statements
has not given a case by case reason for rejection. It certainly will cost her the office she holds in the next election, or any
other public office she might run for.
It's called contempt of court not to comply.

throughout the years.  Maybe I should contact this child's parents as well as their attorney.  Maybe you should do the same.  Maybe you really are a member of NAMBLA.  It certainly sounds like it.  I wonder if you would tell the parents to their face how important you think it is to preserve the information put out by the people who helped cause their son to be murdered, rather than doing something to help prevent it from happening again.

Could the randomization inserted into the GPS system be used for a global
random number server? I think it was in the form of time jitter, so you
would have to use the difference between successive readings.

Look into experimental rocketry and 'can satellites' (there's a link on /.
about the later). The cost to put a bird in space is probably around
$100k right now.

You might need a lawyer for that one.
As far as I can remember,
The court has a transcription
the defense has a copy and the DA gets one.
Nobody else can get a copy. This is not to
say you aren't legally afforded the right to one.
I just think you'll need a lawyer to get one.

Another subpoena was served on me today by Treasury Agent Tom Jack to appear at Jim Bell's trial on April 2, 2001
9:00 AM, in Tacoma, WA.
I have tried three times to get a transcript of my grand jury testimony: faxed letter to the Grand Jury Foreman and AUSA
Robb London January 27; a phone message left for Robb on February 12, and another faxed letter to Robb and the Foreman on February 20 with copy to Judge Tanner, presiding in Jim's case. No answer to any of the 3 requests
