@_subject: Inquiry RE: audiobook reviewers 
Found your request on Editor's Choice. I'm a professional writer, avid reader and believe in audiobooks. Spend a lot of time driving across rural Montana. What's your terms? Can you be more specific if your need still exists. I'm capable and interested and have done numerous book reviews from print.
