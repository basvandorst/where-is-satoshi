@_subject: WANTED: anonymous remailer source code 
Hi All.
I'm interested in porting some remailer code to work on NT (most
likely using NTMail as the smtp service). I'd like to be sure I'm
starting my port from the most recent revisions, and the sources at
the archive at berkeley seem a bit dated. Are they the latest sources?
Are there more recent sources available somewhere?
