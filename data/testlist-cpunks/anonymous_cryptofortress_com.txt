Victoria Police Crime Stoppers
Crime Stoppers offers members of the general public an opportunity to
make confidential calls to the police about any criminal activity.
Calls are not recorded. All callers are given a code number for
identification which they require when making further contact with
Crime Stoppers. If the information leads to an arrest, the caller may
be eligible for a reward of up to $1,000. Crime Stoppers offers a way
of overcoming many of the reasons which inhibit people from reporting
crime, such as not wanting to get involved, fear of retribution and not
being sure that what they have to report is of any significance or who
to tell. Hours of Operation The Crime Stoppers call centre is staffed by Victoria Police personnel
between 7am and 11pm, seven days a week. Information can be left on a
voice mail system outside these hours. Free Call Telephone Number - 1 800 333 000 Crime Stoppers operates nationally and can be called on a free call
hotline from anywhere in Australia. If you are calling from Victoria
your call will be directed to the Victoria Police Crime Stoppers call
centre. Anonymity For those callers who wish to remain anonymous, their total anonymity
is guaranteed. If callers choose to remain anonymous, they are given a
code number which they use when contacting Crime Stoppers to provide
further information and/or to collect a reward. The callerï¿½s anonymity applies even to the board members and other
police outside of the Crime Stoppers Unit who may be involved in the
investigation. Do Crime Stoppers record or use caller display phones? At Crime Stoppers, the emphasis is on protecting the identity of all
callers. Crime Stoppers does not record calls or use caller display
phones otherwise the whole Crime Stoppers program - not only in
Australia but worldwide, would lose its credibility and valuable
criminal information.
Cash Rewards Crime Stoppers pays cash rewards for information that results in the
arrest of an offender. Will I receive a reward for any information? Crime Stoppers pay rewards for any piece of information that leads to
an arrest. The information can be about any crime, not just crimes
featured in the media. Do I get a reward if I call a police station with information? Members of the public will always phone police stations with
information and this is always encouraged. These callers do not qualify
for a Crime Stoppers reward because the Crime Stoppers Unit did not
receive and process the call. How is the amount of the reward determined? The rewards are paid for and administered by the board of Crime
Stoppers Victoria Ltd. Police recommend to the board of management that
a reward be considered for payment to a caller. The amount of the
reward is determined by a points rating scale including the seriousness
of the crime, the number of persons arrested, the number of charges
laid, the value of property recovered or the value of drugs seized. How can I receive a reward and still remain anonymous? The caller is advised to call back after a scheduled board meeting at
which the reward amount will be considered. Suitable arrangements will
then be made for payment of the reward. At all times the identity of
the caller is safeguarded. The normal practice is for the caller to
identify themself with their code number. Crime Stoppers can then make
a cash deposit of the reward amount into a nominated bank account or
alternatively, arrange cash payment at a nominated location.
