We sure can do something, but there maybe some terribly failed attempts before we put some fire in the middle of the pack.

I'm a little unease with all these labels you use to portrait people.
Our paths in life are not in our complete control neither are our
conditions. These labels seem only to bring unfairness to their cases
and do not help ours. The things for which they became targets are more
important to us all than a moralized narrative of their public
Manning for me is far from insane. These kind of words I'd use to
describe some pompous pricks who could never understand Hans C.

Would American citizens be against imposing their State the obligation to provide the defendant with full access to the data held by the persecutors? Obligation to indemnify those who they have wrongly and unlawfully persecuted? Provide full access to the public as regards to their past operations and maintained databases for public scrutiny?
Who is this all around enemy that is everywhere but there, inside the agency?
