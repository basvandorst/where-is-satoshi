she'll be here friday and saturday april 3rd and 4th, and she'll be taking appointments for all day/ night both days at my house. i am trying to be a patient, kind mom.
happy happy days.
here's an irish blessing from us to you...
i am determined to get the house clean so i can relax and sew tomorrow.
i have always dreamed of going to ireland, (and scotland too- mccaleb), to research our family history, and to see the green grass in real life.
may you always have courage to take a chance and never find frogs in your underpants.
back in a few days
i found that amazing old shirt (we're big fans) at the thrift store for $1 and it's so soft. kiss me, i'm irish
my happy little life
with the sun streaming in
she's amazing. i love her style. last minute trip to idaho to see my sister- so much better than home blogging!
like this one, from sweet mary, that she left on the clean room post: "Your house seems so organized. i am not going to worry...about a thing.
we ate corned beef and cabbage with irish soda bread last night in preparation for the day of the irish. soft and long lacy scarf light enough for spring, extra long for winter wrapping, elegant enough for church, cute enough for a tshirt...i really love this scarf pattern (gee can you tell?). i was given the irish name kelly after my great grandparents' last name.
