"Vladimir Z. Nuri" L.D. fails to say why NOW and gay history sites and gun rights sites and
EFF and LPF and SAFE @ MIT and HotWired should be blocked. He also fails
to understand that Brock and I both wrote the article. He finally fails
to understand that CyberPatrol's categories are anything but clear.
