@_subject: Sun's buggy MD5? 
Here's something fun to do on Solaris 2.3 or 2.4.  Notice the
similarity among the Solaris md5 output. Anyone know why this is?
The Sun service folk weren't able to point me to a Solaris bug-report
email address. I had a similar experience looking through Pointers are welcomed.
    A program which uses md5 from a dynamically linked
    (or loaded) library and the nsl library is loaded before a
    ``standard'' md5 library will get md5 results different from the
    rest of the non-Solaris world.
    the non-Solaris md5 files are from RFC 1321.
    some test output has been deleted as it does not fit nicely on a
    standard message line.
    solmd5 seems to give slightly different output on different machines
    and greatly different output with different compilers
    the nsl library is required on Solaris 2.4 when using sockets.
    /usr/include/sys/ppp_chap.h includes a slightly modified---mainly
    names---version of md5.h.

  This seemed to be a duplication of an X.509 certificate hierarchy:
``Hey, I don't know who you are but you have a seals which go back to
a CA I trust.'' In this respect the information seemed unworthy of an
article in SA.
Perhaps I did not read the article closely enough?

  Is there any overlap between this effort and TIS' International

You need to  HIGHFIRST for idea.c & md5.c on big-endian
architectures. It worked after I did this.

  In the ``bones'' version not only was the encryption code eliminated
(e.g., the functionality of libdes.a), but the hooks to call such code
disappeared as well.

  I do agree extending commonly used mailers would be helpful.
  Emacs + mailcrypt (with or without MH & mh-e) already provide the
means to chain one's message through type 1 or mixmaster type 2
remailers. mailcrypt will even choose arbitrary remailer routing for
you based on information gathered from Raph Levien's remailer
list. Unforunately this is not a turnkey solution and requires more
configuration than most users probably want.
