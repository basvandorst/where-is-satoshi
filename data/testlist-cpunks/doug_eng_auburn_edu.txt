No, what's appropriate is what's in the charter. Stuff related to cryptography and its offshoots. Conspiracy du-jour is totally unrelated,
and Perry is right, it doesn't belong. I don't see why that's so hard
to understand. Perry isn't acting as a list owner, but the subconscious
reminder to "stick closer to the charter". He's a bit billious, but it
helps to cut out the drivel, so I don't mind so much.
 They (I) object when something is labelled as cypherpunk because many of
the people on this list have completely opposite views on different
topics. There is no gestault.  A mailing list does not make a common

There was a recent review in network computing of about 60 or so
different CDROM recording devices. The cheapest one was about $500 from
Liberty. The most expensive was I think the one from Kodak, for about $20k.
The capabilities of each are different. Some include buffering, some don't.
However, the pre-mastering software used to make file systems on a CDROM
(HSFS, UFS, DOS, ISO-???? (forget that four digit number) is sold separately,
but generally not too expensive. There are also single and multi-session
CD 'burners'. The single session mean you have to do the entire disk in
one session, and generally if you mess up, you need a new disk. The multi-
session devices let you start a session, and pick it up with more information
at a later time.
Most of them are designed for multi-media or audio recording, but you can
generally get pre-mastering software that will work with something like
CD-XA.. etc..
 Check your software for compatibility before purchasing the hardware.

In this context, I think burlesque fits remarkably well. ;)
