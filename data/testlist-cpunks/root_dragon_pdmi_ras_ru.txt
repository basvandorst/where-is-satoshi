I completly agree with you. Just anoze topic that i can add is installation procedure,especially disk partitoning. It's a very dungerous/important procedure but it's description ins INSTALL.i386 is a bit too short and need examples(espcially). Something like - "Imagine we have disk with such and such patitions and now we want to install OpenBSD here & there so we should... It would'be _very_ helpfull.
BTW, does anybody work on installation software ? Something like in FreeBSD/RedHat ?
