 There is McBits which is supposed to be blazingly fast, but the keys are
very large which makes it unsuitable for everything except fixed-key
systems like PGP.

 It still applies. It says in the small print that it assumes online
attacks against a remote service, and for that threat model 44 bit
passwords are probably good enough. If you want protection against
offline attacks, which you probably want most of the time, you just need
to pick more words.
You should always do that anyway since it's the only way to know the
minimum strength of your password in bits. The XKCD or Diceware method
can be used to generate memorable passwords up to 80 - 120 bits or so,
which should be good enough for a while still as long as login services
don't stupidly limit the passphrase lengths.
