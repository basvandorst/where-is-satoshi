@_subject: Tor nodes blocked by e-gold 
Hash: RIPEMD160
I was able to access my account as of a couple of days ago. Some tor
nodes are in spam DBs, but only a few of them (as far as I know at
least). Wikipedia has blocked tor nodes for close to a year now, as
does some other sites. For this reason, I think it would be useful to
make directory files compressed AND crypted, if possible/viable. Just
my two rapidly devaluing Federal Reserve cents, though 8-).
PS- What country are you in? Based on your writing, I assume you are
from a country where English is not the primary language.
