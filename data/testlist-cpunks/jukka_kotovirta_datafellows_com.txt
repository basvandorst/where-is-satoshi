Telecom Finland the first ISP to integrate strong encryption with commercial
Internet services Helsinki, Finland -  Data Fellows, the leading Internet security solutions
provider, announced today a new version of their popular F-Secure SSH

The F-Secure product line offers strong end-user authentication and
encryption of any transferred data. Because the technologies are of European
origin, they are not limited by U.S. Export control. Internet Service
Providers around the world can now add strong security to their product
"Our F-Secure line of products guarantees ultimate security on the Internet.
Now companies can use the Internet as a serious business tool without the
fear of compromising their corporate assets because of any lack of
security",  explains Mr. Risto Siilasmaa, CEO of Data Fellows Inc. "Also
private Internet users will benefit from this development."
The authentication of users dialling in is done with cryptography, making
management and access control much easier to arrange on a large scale.
Dialling in can be done through any network structure, including the
Internet itself, facilitating Internet roaming. "Internet users will gain immediate benefit from F-Secure products. And the
emerging concept of 'extranets' between companies cannot launch safely
without strong authentication and encryption mechanisms", concludes Mr.
