Re: Holiday Gift Buying
In 1989 when I built my first Web Site, floridafish.com., I spent huge amounts of my budget mailing, faxing and calling potential customers. Fifty cents and up to mail (stamps, letterhead, envelopes, etc..), at least a dime to fax. Print. Radio. Flyers.
 Today we're officially in a recession. How this relates directly to your business, and how you adjust to marketing your product makes all the difference to you. Who are your Holiday shoppers?  Direct targeting with  e Seine Trawler will increase results 500% !    Over the past year I have developed a software system that can target your potential customers and extract hundreds of e-mails in a matter of minutes. Any country. Any target business. Any professional group. Any language. Yep, we even do Chinese. (Yen is strong-could you sell your product in Taiwan, Hong Kong or mainland China?). And you don't need a computer. We'll do the e-mailing for you. Attach your Home Page if you like.
We'll send the Trawler out to gather your potential customers, 1,000, 10,000, whatever is out there. However many you want. We'll put the captured e-mails in a simple txt. format - works with any Windows application and send you half. You send us a check. Nickel per. We'll send you the other half.  Sit back and target market. FOR FREE! They don't all stumble across your Web site...
Questions? Drop us a note or e-mail. We're in the neighborhood.
