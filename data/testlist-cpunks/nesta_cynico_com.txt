I have a small linux box doing 1000 keys per second.  I had to re-download the brloop and brclient, cuse when I viewed them on the WWW page and attempted ot save them I forgo that Lynx will truncate soem lines, leaving me with some errors.  I got complete correct versions an the box is chugging away.

important to commerce online.  But I still hate to see these types of solutions being used to try and cover something that should, and could be fixed in the underlying protocol itself.  Wouldnt AH and ESP take care of a large portion of the existing security holes?  Certainly not all of them, but it would solve alot of problems and make development of secure applications much easier.
note: is anyone working on implementeing some of the things outlines in R(1825?) ?  I think Perry posted regarding it awhile back, but havent heard much about it since.

If you look on pg. 34 of the handbook, Sect. 97.A13 says that this list is primarily for passing child porn and dirty limericks in unbreakable codes.  You really should read your Internet Handbook before asking these questions.  You Internet Service Provider DID give you the Official Internet Handbook right?

@_subject: Postscript in Netscape 
That just doesn't make all that much sense.  "regardless of the users use of their product"?  Sure, like PGP should be considered insecure software because as a user I could use it on an ISP, and make my passwd two characters long and leave it set as an environment variable in the shell for the pre-mail script I have.  No, otherwise the postscript viewer is insecure.  Netscape is not handling the postscript code, just passing it along.  It does not come with an application for postscript automagically setup for the user so you can't blame it for spawning an application without the users knowledge.  Maybe there should(or is there already) be a note in the docs mentioning this, but of all the regular users I know, none of them read documentation.  To expect a system to call itself insecure because the user is stupid and invites evil in doesn't make much sense.  So I guess Java can NEVER be secure because if I want I can enable native calls and all the file access classes and other dangerous stuff for any application I want to and shut down all the inbuilt security.  It's Suns fault that I'm dumb as a brick wall?

@_subject: Postscript in Netscape 
Jeff doesn't speak directly for Netscape, Doc.  Your previous suggestion didn't make much sense, the idea that a single peice of software must close ALL the holes across the board to be called "secure" is ludicrous.  Granted it should cover all within it's domain, and provide safegaurds, but to expect Netscape to handle security problems that rightfully should be fixed in the TCP/IP protocol stack, or in the interprator for another language that happens to have a security hole and can be spawned off.  Netscape does not come with a postscript app preset so the user has to make a conscious choice.  All postscript viewers I have used make mention of these security problems, and I would hope(tho do not for one second believe) that users read this warnings.  If they don't and set-up the browser to spawn off files of unknown origins, then they are taking their own risks and I do not think for one second netscape could be held responsible.  There is no defense against the dreaded DEU hole that exists on all systems.

I don't think they have vested interests at all.  I think that they are able to see that the problem is not with the browser.  You know "/bin/login" is insecure because it allows hooks for unpasswded logins, I mean if the user wanted to they could leave root unpasswded and if they are using "/bin/login" someone could get into their system just like that.
That point is NOT valid IMO.  NO, postscript provides the method for executing shell commands if you accept postscript from anywhere.  Netscape can NEVER be "fool"proof against all hardware errors, particularly loose nuts on the keyboard.
