I'd suggest a fed TLA or FLA, something like FCC or FEMA.  A fed can
always make up an excuse to be just about anywhere.  FBI, DEA, and ATF
are too high-profile.  SECURITY and POLICE are too generic; people might
not take you seriously.
That's easy enough.  Grab a gun, sweat pants, hooded jacket, ski mask,
gloves, and lurk outside some isolated fine dining establishment.  If
your (loyal) taxpayers complain about taxation without representation,
accuse them of being unpatriotic, and offer them a chance to vote on who
you mug next.
