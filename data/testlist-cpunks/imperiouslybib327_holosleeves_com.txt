my homekeeping secrets
time for a new spring look...
i love her style. like this one, from sweet mary, that she left on the clean room post: "Your house seems so organized. really, cate is also mexican, japanese, native american, swiss, and a lot more- a true american- so we actually have a lot of family history travelling to do, but i really love the romantic beauty of ireland, and have always been drawn to that part of the world. plus i really love corned beef.
she's cute
i love that she's an expert knitter and yet chooses to create very simple pieces;  kae
it was super delicious. have you seen april's ms living yet? may you always have courage to take a chance and never find frogs in your underpants.
have a happy st. patrick's day. i am excited about my new running shoes.
i love the comments i get from all of you. i have always dreamed of going to ireland, (and scotland too- mccaleb), to research our family history, and to see the green grass in real life.
1. in the craft room i throw everything on the homework table. that clears up the floor for more mess craft making. kiss me, i'm irish
my happy little life
it's definately worth the long drive,
she'll be here friday and saturday april 3rd and 4th, and she'll be taking appointments for all day/ night both days at my house. doesn't she look like lucy from chronicles of narnia? (so is corned beef if you've never tried it). but so worth it.
pps- our topic of convo for the night was this article from the wall street journal.
i am blocking my two latest projects today and will show them tomorrow. she never looks like a senator from krypton on the red carpet. i always enjoy knitting lacy stuff but this pattern was especially fun, super easy, and portable.
