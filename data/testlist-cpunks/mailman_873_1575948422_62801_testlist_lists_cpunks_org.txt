   based on [3]Nullsoft's [4]WASTE, as reported here [5]a few days ago.
   VIA PadLockSL included both a Windows and Linux client and some
   special extensions to work with [6]security hardware built into
   certain VIA products. It was released under the GPL so I managed to
   snag a copy of the source code right before VIA suddenly removed their
   page ([7]Google cache). I have posted Linux compilation instructions
   and mirrored the source [8]here. If VIA has decided not to pursue the
   project further, I think the F/OSS community should turn this project
   into something, it has potential to be a great tool."
