Quantum entanglement is real. Sounds like you have some reading to do. ;) basically once particles are associated they can communicate / stay in sync regardless of distance. Amazing stuff.

I believe our understanding of info transfer needs to change. The data is not traveling anywhere because it appears to exist simultaneously here & there and when one changes the other does without delay. There has to be another dimension of energy / ether we need to discover that would make this make sense. Like looking into a fish pond but the fish don't see surface, only your hand dipping in water as a miraculous occurrence.
