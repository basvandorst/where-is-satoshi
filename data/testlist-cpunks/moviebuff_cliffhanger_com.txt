@_subject: Using pictures as links <p> 
I'm changing my website and want to use pictures for the links to other pages. But, someone told me I should still put a 'click here' underneath all the pictures. To me, this removes all purpose of using the pictures.  How can I get across that you click on the pictures to get to other pages without coming right out and saying so? For example, I have a page with actor and actress information and just want to have a picture of my favorite stars to click on and change the picture every couple of days.
