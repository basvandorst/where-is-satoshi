Integration of Ancient Wisdom and Modern Scientific Technologies Leading to a New Branch of Medicine
          No innovation has gained such a fast foothold and recognition among medical experts as the utilisation of the natural laws of harmony.
          When one considers that the term Medical Resonance Therapy Music was only coined 14 years ago, and then looks at the present level of documentation on research and developments in this new branch of medicine, and the statements of leading medical experts from many fields such as hormone research, gynaecology, paediatrics, dermatology, research into headaches, intensive care medicine etc. right up to international recognition as the most successful "anti-stress remedy in the world" at the International Conference "Society, Stress and Health" of the World Health Organisation (WHO), then it is also worthwhile examining the causes for such enormous medical success more closely.
