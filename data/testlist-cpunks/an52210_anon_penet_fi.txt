As far as I know, blacknet was one of the spoofs Detweiler (tmp at netcom.com)
made to make the cypherpunks list look bad.
I'm not sure if it was a Detweiler spoof, but if it wasn't,
BlackNet is definitively cool.
I couldn't find the original BlackNet posting, maybe somebody
could repost it ?

Try 'telnet c-spac.org 25', 'HELO ', 'VRFY doug'.
