On Sportlight, I recall someone (Factsheet 5?) recommending another pub, the quarterly Paranoia (which you can actually buy on newsstands in NYC), because "they get a lot of stuff from Spotlight, so you won;t have to soil you hands with the original source."  It's a fine magazine, and even has an email address: paranoia at aol.com (but would a paranoid use email?)

@_subject: Health Record Privacy 
Back in November, Rep Condit (D, CA) held hearings on "Implications of Health Care REvision on the Confidentiality of Health Records."  IE, the use of the 'smart card' to encode health records, as part of 'portability' of health care.  Has anyone kept up on this?  I'm looking for articles, studies, monographs, rants, and screeds.
