HavenCo's error was not initially raising the necessary cash to buy Sealand outright from the Bates, or if that didn't work they could have done it the old fashioned way by marrying into the family.  Not having total control led to this outcome.

@_subject: The Independent Institute's take on PAM 
THE LIGHTHOUSE, the weekly e-mail newsletter of The Independent Institute, the non-politicized public-policy research organization.  "Enlightening Ideas for Public Policy..."
Excerpted via :Vol. 5, Issue 31, August 4, 2003
PENTAGON SCRAPS INFORMATION MARKET
Even those who understandably scorned the Pentagon's recently cancelled Policy Analysis Market (PAM) -- a.k.a. the terrorism futures market, as some detractors called it -- should admit that it was innovative in a badly needed way.
In proposing a virtual market to help predict contingencies in the Middle East and elsewhere, PAM set out to achieve what years of pseudo-reform of U.S. military and intelligence agencies had failed even to attempt -- to bypass the hierarchical bureaucracy that has led to numerous deadly intelligence failures.
By making use of the knowledge of thousands of people willing to put their money on the line (maximum bet: $100), PAM was based on the insight that markets, driven by economic actors with powerful incentives to guess correctly, often know better than a handful of professional prognosticators. This point has been well illustrated by the web-based Iowa Political Stock Market, a virtual market that has consistently predicted election outcomes more accurately than Because PAM was controversial for more than one reason, it should not be surprising that it was misrepresented by politicians and the media.
"Contrary to impressions in the media, the primary purpose of the PAM was not to predict individual events of terrorism but rather to predict inputs into terrorism such as the economic growth rates of countries in the Middle East, political instability, and military activity," write Alexander Tabarrok, research director of the Independent Institute, and Robin Hanson, the principal architect of the Policy Analysis Market, in a new op-ed.
Rather, write Tabarrok and Hanson, PAM was to help answer such questions as "What would happen to unrest in the Middle East if the US withdrew its troops in Saudi Arabia" and "How would Jordan fare politically if the 'roadmap' were successfully implemented?"
Recent history suggests that traditional approaches to such questions, even if well-informed, can become ignored or politicized.
"The yes-man phenomena means that information doesn't rise from the field to the decision-makers," write Tabarrok and Hanson. "And sometimes the bosses don't want to hear what the field has to say. Remember the CIA and FBI analysts who repeatedly tried to signal their worries about terrorism to their superiors but were rebuffed? In contrast, a PAM would produce a public and easily understood number that would be difficult to ignore."
Fortunately, the future of such "information markets," "prediction aggregators," or "idea futures" doesn't rest on government funding and would be managed better without it. A few visionary institutions, such as Hewlett-Packard, have already used them to aid in decision-making, and many more will be adopted. But as with so many innovations, don't expect the government to employ them effectively for a long, long time.

I agree except to say that there must be a minimal level of freedom and security in which to operate. You'd have to be not in a place like Rwanda where the Hutu might literally hack you and your hardware with their machetes.

This is utter bullshit. The US knew that Bin Laden was a threat and had been conducting covert operations with NSA against him for some number of years prior to 9/11. NSA was erasing the various bank databases that Bin Laden's funds were in and they were messing around with his wire transfers. Hell, Intel was even playing taped conversations of Bin Laden with his mother to impress Congress all prior to 9/11.
Bin Laden choose the WTC as a symbol of American financial imperialism and as a punishment to our screwing with him...The failure IMHO is that rather than in engaging in largely harassing techniques-We should have gone after him in much as the same fashion as we are today-It isn't like we didn't have ample What I'm saying for the hearing impaired is that our Intel agencies made the threat worse by playing games that enraged the attacker (Bin Laden) rather than neutralizing the threat.

'Wired': The Coolest Magazine on the Planet
By DAVID CARR
Wired magazine, that storied artifact of a digital age, was conceived by its editors as a ''a reverse time capsule. It would sail back through time and land at people's feet.'' And so it has, most recently in the form of ''Wired: A Romance,'' a book by one of the magazine's contributing editors, Gary Wolf. Our notions of the future have a tendency to age quickly, and Wired, a magazine that served as both Boswell and bomb thrower for the geekerati in the 1990's, seems to have aged more quickly than most. The seminal publication, Wolf writes, was created in the midst of a digital revolution that its high priest, Louis Rossetto, liked to refer to as a ''Bengali typhoon.'' By the time Rossetto and Wired's co-founder, Jane Metcalfe, were thrown clear, everything had changed, but not in the ways that they once thought it would. Wired was important not just because it was the first magazine to make the computer world seem hip; it also trained its eye on the implications of the onrushing new technology, not merely on appraising the newest machines and trendiest gadgets. (Though Wired featured plenty of articles about those things, too.) The magazine, Rossetto promised somewhat grandiosely early on, would foment ''a revolution without violence that embraces a new, nonpolitical way to improve the future based on economics beyond macro control, consensus beyond the ballot box, civics beyond government and communities beyond the confines of time and geography.'' Rossetto's manifesto seems quaint just 10 years later, but it found many disciples. Gary Wolf, an early Wired employee, was among them, and he has written a deceptively deadpan recollection that reads more like a libretto than a straightforward work of journalism. Wolf expertly traces the magazine's heavily hyped ascendancy, though, sadly, most readers will know all along that the magazine Rossetto saw as a Trojan horse for revolution was eventually sold in 1998 to a corporation (Conde Nast) like any common asset. (The magazine still exists, though it doesn't carry the swagger and prestige it once did.) Wolf writes with a former true believer's skepticism, a wan idealism rubbed out by subsequent events. As his book's title suggests, Wolf is still a bit wistful about Wired's careering journey through the 90's. It's hard to blame him. The corporate-dominated magazine industry tends to stay safely behind significant issues, while Wired was that odd indie publication that actually enabled a movement by appealing to its nobler instincts. But as Wolf demonstrates, Wired's purity of purpose -- Rossetto seemed to care about money only as oxygen for his dream -- did not inoculate the magazine from the ambient greed that reduced a hoped-for paradigm shift to a pile of failed I.P.O.'s. ''Wired: A Romance'' is less a love story than a theological autopsy of a religion that flourished and went away in less than a decade. Things happened quickly for Wired -- remember ''Internet time''? At its height in the mid-90's, Wired could be found in the lobbies of venture capitalists, on the light tables of designers, underneath the coffee cups of computer geeks and in the middle of the only conversation that seemed to matter. It was, briefly, the coolest magazine on the planet. This book is fundamentally a biography of Rossetto, a larger-than-life personality whom Wolf compares to ''a magnet whose grip increased dramatically at close range.'' In retrospect, it would be easy to mistake Rossetto for another would-be Internet guru and Wired as a curio of a bygone time, but as Wolf makes clear, the revolution that Rossetto championed was not about the Web. Rossetto saw desktop publishing as a profound reinvention of the printing press. ''He thought computer publishing would change the world,'' Wolf writes. And Rossetto knew a thing or two about revolution. As Wolf points out, Rossetto, a former anarchist who obtained a master's degree in business administration from Columbia, was a global itinerant, a gaunt, hippie-ish Zelig who just happened to be in the neighborhood when the Shining Path emerged in Peru, when the Tamil rebellion began in Sri Lanka, when the Red Brigades sowed chaos in Italy. Small wonder Rossetto ended up in San Francisco in the early 90's with Jane Metcalfe, then his girlfriend, on the cusp of another kind of insurgency, both of them working to finance a new kind of magazine. Rossetto wanted to call their journal DigIt -- as in either ''digit'' or ''dig it'' -- a bad idea that Metcalfe mercifully talked him out of. The new magazine would be named Wired. With the help of $20,000 from a sympathetic Dutch entrepreneur, the pair managed to get inexpensive access to a Canon color copier -- an exotic technology at the time -- to produce a prototype. Several of Wired's more durable angels, investors with real money who bought Rossetto's conceits, signed on later. And John Plunkett, the man responsible for Wired's neon-suffused, anarchic design, committed to joining the magazine in spite of himself. This glossy fever dream of a magazine made its debut at the Macworld conference on Jan. 2, 1993. The early adopters snatched it up and Wired was on its way. But Wolf demonstrates that Rossetto always seemed to keep his ambitions just ahead of his funding. Chunks of the enterprise were handed out to investors so that Wired could expand to the Web, to television, to Europe and beyond. The magazine's Web site, HotWired, turned out to be a particularly effective way of making money disappear. Wolf, who became HotWired's executive editor in 1995, appears in the narrative at this point, saying that after meetings with Rossetto he left his boss's office with ''the light step of a person who has been given permission to be bad.'' But Wolf's efforts to enrich his writer friends with lucrative freelance assignment for the Web site comes off as a misdemeanor in felonious times. The pressure to move Wired toward an initial public offering drove an ill-advised effort for bigness at all costs. No one cared about profits, and deals were made willy-nilly to build the hypothetical value of the company, including adding a search engine, the gewgaw of the moment. The pranksters at Suck, a sardonic (and now defunct) site built by Wired employees on the sly, captured the era's ethos with carnal clarity. In an essay written at the very beginning of the Web boom, Wolf writes, ''The Sucksters' advice was to fluff up a site, locate a rich, stupid buyer and then run away fast before the concoction deflated.'' To his credit, Rossetto never saw how giving away content free on the Web could make anyone rich. Wolf describes -- in too much detail, because he happened to be in the middle of it -- how Rossetto fought to make visitors to HotWired register, which some believed violated the Web's ethos. By this time, bankers and shareholders were looking over his shoulder, accusing him of being a profligate Luddite at a revolution he once led. While charting the Nasdaq's rise and eventual fall, Wolf shows Rossetto and Metcalfe readying Wired for a ''liquidity event,'' that supremely validating 90's moment. But when they hit the road in October 1996 to pitch investors, Rossetto's overweening ambitions and the market's gyrations left Wired's public offering dead on arrival. Rossetto become so preoccupied with saving the business that he eventually handed leadership of the magazine over to Katrina Heron, a former editor at Vanity Fair and The New Yorker. Heron, who is now a consultant for The New York Times, proved to be an able and popular steward of the magazine, but in stepping aside Rossetto had built his own gallows. The money men who had attached themselves to Wired set up a series of impossible financial targets for Rossetto, and in March 1998 he and Metcalfe were cast out of the future they had built. The magazine was eventually sold to Conde Nast, and its two founders ended up with $30 million and a profoundly bad taste in their mouths. Wolf allows Andrew Anker, the ferociously ambitious C.E.O. of the company, to serve up an epitaph for the ideals that once drove Wired. With the sale of the magazine on the table, Wolf recounts how Anker and other senior Wired employees went to a bar in San Francisco for an impromtu wake. Anker gleefully tallies up his substantial gains to the outrage of his less fortunate colleagues. ''What is this, 'Sesame Street'?'' Anker said. ''Every man for himself means every man for himself!'' The future, it turned out, would still be written by Charles Darwin in spite of Wired's best efforts. David Carr is a media reporter for The Times.

Author James Bovard will appear on C-SPAN 's Booknotes with Brian Lamb this Sunday, 11/02, from 8 pm to 9 pm (I believe it may re-air from 11 pm to midnight).  Bovard will be discussing his new book "Terrorism and Tyranny: Trampling Freedom, Justice, and Peace to Rid the World of Evil".  I've read the book and recommend it highly.  For program notes go to:
For additional information on the works of James Bovard please go to:
 bfrom the publisher's website
"The war on terrorism is the first political growth industry of the new Millennium." So begins Jim Bovard's newest and, in some ways, most provocative book as he casts yet another jaundiced eye on Washington and the motives behind protecting "the homeland" and prosecuting a wildly unpopular war with Iraq. For James Bovard, as always, it all comes down to a trampling of personal liberty and an end to privacy as we know it. From airport security follies that protect no one to increased surveillance of individuals and skyrocketing numbers of detainees, the war on terrorism is taking a toll on individual liberty and no one tells the whole grisly story better than Bovard.

In a message dated 11/25/2003 1:23:08 PM Eastern Standard Time, In the 1996 release of the film, "The People vs. Larry Flynt", there is a scene where a warrant is served on Flynt's home. His bedroom typified the ultimate "safe room" where the agents serving the warrant couldn't get in until the room was opened from the inside.  Obviously everyone doesn't have the money that Flynt has in order to effectively harden ones house, but you can cheaply and rather effectively improve your haunts to allow more warning.
The system you describe would in most jurisdiction still be considered illegal and premeditative.  You're better off with passive measures.

B B B B Brian Dalton posted bail yesterday afternoon, not long after Franklin County Common Pleas Judge David E. Cain set it at $50,000. B B B B Cain told Dalton, 24, that he could have no contact with minors, no access to the Internet and that he was under house arrest and parental supervision. B B B B Paperwork for his jail release was being completed early this morning. B B B B Prosecutors had asked for at least a $100,000 bond.

He pleaded guilty in 2001 to pandering obscenity. B B B B His mother had found a diary stating his fantasies about children and given it to his probation officer. B B B B Dalton said the children were imaginary. At the time, he was on probation for possession of child pornography. B B B B Dalton pleaded guilty to the pandering charge, which drew international attention. Critics said the charge and his imprisonment violated his First Amendment right of self-expression. He tried to withdraw his plea twice, but Common Pleas Judge Nodine Miller rejected his requests. B B B B She sentenced him to seven years for pandering, plus 4B= years for violating his probation. B B B B The Franklin County Court of Appeals overturned his conviction in July, citing ineffective counsel. B B B B Benson A.

His office has asked the Ohio Supreme Court to review the lower appealscourt decision, and Wolman said Daltonbs response to the Supreme Court is due Sept. 29.

In a message dated 9/17/03 10:57:55 AM Eastern Daylight Time, This Brian Dalton weirdo being local I've read all the media coverage and he was encouraged to write his fantasies down in a diary by his therapist-  The parents found the diary and went to the authorities stupidly thinking that they'd try to get him additional help-  the help came in the form of charges of pandering obscenity, although he didn't show the diary to anyone.
I have a friend who won a county prosecutor election about ten years ago, and he told me the prevailing theory on child predators is that no therapy works and the best strategy is to try to get them the maximum time in jail thus keeping them from being able to abuse more children.
Of course this case has obviously violated the first amendment, this guy didn't abuse actual children, just wrote a rather sick and twisted story about keeping kids locked in cages in a basement for sexual entertainment.  Knowing the power structure as I do they care jack shit about the constitution, but rather about practical ways to keep predators off the street.
I noted that the Dalton was also ordered to have no Internet access, which is interesting as he didn't do an Internet crime. His diary was in handwritten print form.  Regards, Matt-

In a message dated 9/20/03 10:36:31 PM Eastern Daylight Time, timcmay at got.net Any prediction when the police state fascism of the air will be exported to the interstate highway system?  Personally I won't fly either, as I want to be treated as a customer and I refuse to be treated as a suspect.   As a suspect the airlines can eat my seat.
However, I refuse to be hog-tied so I travel around the US on the ground-  I've encountered two travel concerns- One on I-10 outside of El Paso at a border patrol checkpoint- The Border Patrolman wanted to know where I had been and where I was going and what I had been doing...In short, intrusive none of their business questions.  That time I was traveling from Phoenix to the French Quarter of New Orleans- The Fed wanted to know why I was using the southern route, so I said why not? At the time they were searching some hapless teenage boy's pickup so they waved me through.  Interestingly I visited Mexico that trip and when I reentered the US I didn't even have to show ID.  The guys at Customs and Immigration just waved me through after asking me where I'm from, albeit I look American.
The other was at a Canadian border crossing on my way to Montreal.  The Maple leafers have a database of American gun owners, as the customs guy asked me "You have a pistol?" to which I replied no. He asked again not believing me "You don't have a pistol???" Upon which I replied that is correct I don't have a pistol, I have pistols plural.  My buddy traveling with me announced in a loud voice so the entire station could hear, of course we have pistols, and rifles too-  That's what free people have and that's one of the reason's I'd never move to Canada.  Naturally my car got searched with a fine toothed comb, but I added I wouldn't be stupid enough to bring my pistol. I spent considerable effort cleaning my car of any stray ammo, thinking what sort of post 9/11 hell I'd me in if they found a .308 or errant 9 mm. Speaking with Canadian customs however I discovered that I could have legally imported 5,000 rounds of ammo.  Apparently people do so for hunting trips.  Noteworthy is the unguarded St. Lawrence River with unguarded boats moored alongside the shore.  We traveled alongside it on both sides of the border and thought how trivially easy it would be to cross undetected.  It's not like the government efforts have to make Regards,  Matt Gaylor-

In a message dated 9/21/03 6:55:47 PM Eastern Daylight Time, Only certain guns are legal for the socialists to the North, basically hunting bolt actions and shotguns.  Incidentally such guns are usually many more times more powerful than most pistols.  Ohio and Florida are the main source of illegal guns in Canada, so me being a gun owner from Ohio with a house in Florida, I got extra scrutiny.  Quite a testament to their databases.
One of the women customs agents spoke of their distaste for pistols, so in reply I mentioned that just last week I shot a Para-Ordinance .45 belonging to a buddy.  Para-Ordinace is a gun manufactor from Ontario.  While in Toronto I read that some employees from Para were caught selling gun parts to whoever wanted them-  It appears that gun control doesn't work for them either.
You can travel to Canada with a rifle, you just have to declare it along with the serial number which they record and where you're going to hunt or camp or whatnot.  Regards,  Matt-

Database search system debated
Police agencies, civil libertarians divided over online records access
By DAVID PATCH
BLADE STAFF WRITER
Information in a controversial database searching system already is publicly
available but not coordinated so law-enforcement officials can easily use it
to investigate crimes or thwart terrorism, the head of the Ohio Highway Patrol
told a local trucking group yesterday."Right now, the public library has
better information than we do," Col. Paul McClellan, the patrol's
told the Toledo Trucking Association at the Toledo Club. "When I go home at
night, I can find out more about people by surfing the Internet on my home
computer than I can in my office."
The MATRIX search system, which combs public records like driver's licenses,
vehicle registrations, court records, and land transaction information, is
available only to law-enforcement personnel with a specific investigative
purpose, the colonel said.
The system, whose name stands for Multi-State Anti-Terrorism Information
Exchange, is managed by a Florida firm under contract to five states that are
piloting it, including Ohio and Michigan. So far, however, Ohio is not fully
participating by contributing photos or Social Security numbers from its
records, the colonel said.
Civil libertarians argue that the system is an open invitation for police to
track the behavior of ordinary citizens, regardless of their involvement in
criminal or terrorist activities.
MATRIX effectively is "an advanced surveillance system" designed not only to
"build dossiers on all of our lives," but also to allow rapid mathematical
searches for supposed irregular patterns that might identify troublemakers,
according to the American Civil Liberties Union.
"Judgments about reasonable suspicion of criminal activity are fundamentally
human judgments that cannot now be made accurately by computers," the ACLU
said in a recent position paper on the subject.
"They make it sound like such an ominous project, but it's not. It's very
open," responded Sal Hernandez, vice president of Seisint, Inc., a Boca Raton,
Fla.-based information services firm that pioneered the system and manages it
for its multistate clients. MATRIX data represent "things the cops already
but it's putting it all in one place and letting the police access it
Dean Kaplan, the trucking association's president who, with his wife,
operates a local trucking firm specializing in hazardous materials transport,
his main concern about the system would be if its capability "gets into the
wrong hands." Seisint asserts that the system is protected by the most
online security available.
Colonel McClellan, meanwhile, said that availability of such a system could
have brought more law-enforcement attention sooner to the recent spate of
Columbus-area car shootings that included the killing Nov. 25 of Gail Knisley
I-270. Only after Mrs. Knisley's death did area police start comparing notes
realize that each had received similar reports of gunshots hitting vehicles
on I-270 and other nearby roads, he said.
A system like MATRIX would have allowed various agencies to enter what they
knew about the case and start narrowing the field of suspects sooner, he said.
Charles C. McCoy, Jr., 28, who was arrested March 17 in Las Vegas, pleaded not
guilty Monday to charges accusing him of 12 of 24 shootings dating to May,
