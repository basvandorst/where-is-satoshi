Ok, everybody can have efdtt.c.gz as their public key!
Here is the algorithm:
Choose a j such that 256^j is a large enough random
space for you to feel secure, and factors of that order
will be hard to find in a composite number.
Pick a random number, R < 256^j
Find q = nextprime(256^j - R)
Find k = decimal representation of efdtt.c.gz
Find p = nextprime(k*256^(j+1)/q)
Verify that (p-1)(n-1) is relatively prime to your public exponent,
if not, try a few public exponents, or start over with a new
random number.
Compute n=pq, this is the public key modulus.
Verify that n/256^(j+1) = k in case there was a large (>256) gap
in the primes.  If it fails, try p=nextprime(k*256^(j+2)/q).
n can be converted to hex and gunzipped to the efdtt.c source code.
Go compute your private exponent d, then destroy p, q and R.
Let everybody know your public key and what it can be used for ;-)
Attached is a sample program to illustrate the key generation.
Feed efdtt.c.gz to its standard input.
For j=32 (256 bit random number), it takes about 1-1/2 minutes
on my 266MHz G3. Be sure to use your own random number, not the
one in the code.
