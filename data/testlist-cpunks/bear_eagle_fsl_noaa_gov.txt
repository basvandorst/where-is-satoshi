Naturally they'll open a file on you to document the fact that you requested
information under the FOIA and to file a copy of the information returned
to you.
Will they start an investigation on the basis of the fact that you
requested information under the FOIA?  How many people with rather, shall
we say, unusual ideas do you think have pestered the CIA or NSA with
FOIA requests?
Of course, if you admit you learned about this on a cryptoanarchist
e-mail list... :-)

So write an encryption routine that wastes bandwidth but outputs executable
code.  You could even encapsulate it within procedures which randomly call
one another, to make it look more like real code.  (Your encrypted data would
be limited to shuffling data between registers and operations within registers,
  mov ax, bx
  add ax, cx
  mov bx, dx
  or  ax, bx
It's not a crime to write bad assembler code... yet.
A nice piece of misdirection would be a homebrew compiler for some
really bizarre language.  A compiler which produces output remarkably
like the output of your encryption program.
If someone asks why you are only using a small subset of the instruction
set, you shrug and claim that optimized code generation is on your "to-do"

In this case, since the modulus is a small power of 2, you can do exhaustive
search.  There is _one_ sequence of 256 distinct values.
Still want to know how long it will take to crack his ciphertext?
Since    max_integer / gcd (range, max_integer) > range
you can move the modulus operation around without worrying about
weird effects from the finite word size.  This is because the closed form of the loop is:
   seed[k] = (seed[0] * mult^k + incr * sum (j = 0 to k-1) of mult^j) % range
which is equal to
   seed[k] = (seed[0] % range) * (mult % range)^k +
and the modulus operation with a power-of-2 range simply keeps the last
n bits.  But, this also means there are effectively only "range" possible
values for the initial seed.
Even if you make the increment and multiplier part of the key, they must
(both?) be odd so you only have 22 bits of key.  Of course at this point
you can simply use the fact that this "one time pad" is actually a Vigenere cipher with 256 columns -- easy to crack if you have some
insight into the nature of the plaintext (e.g., English text).
For instance, 10-15 small documents (40 lines) encrypted with the same
key is enough to crack it even if the multiplier and increment are unknown but constant.

"L. Detweiler" writes
It's always a dangerous strategy to recognize your opponent has a
legitimate position.  If they dismissed our concerns with hand-waving
they could also defuse Congressional (or other) inquiries with an appeal
to authority; but with these documents they've acknowledged the
legitimacy of our concerns.
You mean they _wouldn't_?  Refusal to provide all documents and the
dates of these documents (i.e., not during the initial design stages)
suggests that they could well be covers for other documents.
If nothing else, I would like to see correspondence at the same level
from a year ago, back when it appeared Bush was a shoo-in for reelection.
I suspect we will find a substantially different tone....
I don't think we have _any_ information about the *original* intent.
We have some indications of what they intended after Clinton was
elected, but none of these documents are from the Bush era.
Why not accept this at face value -- the government asked AT&T how
many phones they would need to purchase to make it worthwhile for
AT&T to make the things, AT&T gave them a number, and the government
said "Okay!"
I read this as "National security officials will have access to the keys,
but this will not be revealed to the public."
Nothing I hadn't already assumed.  :-(
No, "narcotraffickers" are the people who bring the drugs into the country.  Apparently the Feds have decided to leave persecution of
alleged drug dealers (note tenses) to local authorities using
forfeiture laws, while the Feds concentrate on the people bringing
the drugs into the country and the major distribution networks.
More likely the tendency of people to pretend "this can't happen to
me!"  After all, most people only deal with other residents of North
America and there are no internal cryptographic restrictions.  Yet.

This could tie a lawyer up in fits, because even if you sent digital
cash across the border, you could still produce a _spendable_ copy
in the originating country!  In fact, you could have the same 'bill'
residing on media in a dozen countries!
You couldn't legally spend more than one copy of the digital cash,
of course, but digital cash (unlike hard cash) can be located in
several places -- and probably would be if you're talking about a
substantial amount of money.
Many countries restrict or monitor the flow of currency across their border; this isn't simply a result of the WoD.  However, the WoD was
the main reason publicly acknowledged.

This still raises some interesting possibilities:
  Federal law requires that Indian tribes be permitted to offer all
  forms of gambling permitted _anywhere_ under state law.   Indian reservations have a serious problem with poverty, unemployment,
  etc.
  Most gambling is hard to arrange at a distance, but it is possible
  to form _digital cards_ and then play any of the usual card games.
  An Indian tribe in an appropriate jursidiction installs a Internet
  node with digital cash (backed by checks, credit cards, etc) and
  _digital cards_.  Or even a Compuserve account. (ugh).  Anything,
  as long as the processor is located on Indian land.
  It offers real-time poker games.  For real money.  From anywhere in
  the world.  :-)
  (BTW, you would _not_ offer blackjack, or only with _very_ large
  decks, because of the large potential for card counting programs).
  Just to confuse issues further, the poker software is owned by a
  nonprofit organization and licensed to the Indian nation with the
  condition that a portion of their profits go towards education.
  When someone claims that the tribe is offering gambling in an area
  where it is prohibited, you can legitimately claim that the actual
  processing is done on the Indian land; the only thing done in
  other jurisdictions is communications.    Example: if a man stood just outside of the reservation and yelled   instructions to a confederate at a game just inside the boundary, would
  that be illegal gambling _on the part of the House_?
  In this case, digital cash isn't _required_ since the House could
  simply keep accounting records directly.  However, it would make it
  simpler for the House to honor outside bets, if a person could get
  a "chip" from the House, pay off a bet to a third party with the
  "chip", and then the third party could use the "chip" himself.

@_subject: Landlords accepting search warrants.... 
This keeps popping up, probably due to old _Dragnet_ episodes...
As I understand contract law regarding leases, a landlord _cannot_
grant permission for a police search unless the lease is in default.
Or, more precisely, if they did you could sue them for "breach of
contract" and extract pretty hefty penalties.
Perhaps California leases have some standard clause which permits
this, but in general a "lease" transfers all "non-freeholder" property
rights, except for those explicitly -returned- within the contract.
That means the tenant is the property owner for all intents and
purposes except for "freeholder" rights (e.g., a tenant can't sell
the property).
