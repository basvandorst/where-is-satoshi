@_subject: 0/1 knapsack 
P.S. If you're considering writing a cipher based on them, don't.  Every
knapsack-based encryption algorithm has been broken.

@_subject: 0/1 knapsack 
A knapsack is a container that can only hold so much of something.  You
have a collection of objects with a weight and/or volume and a value. You want to maximize the value.  Fractional knapsack problems concern
things like flour and sugar, that you can measure out a fractional unit
of.  In 0/1 knapsack problems, you have a collection of objects: either
you put in the TV or you don't; no half-TV's.
Quoting from _Introduction to Algorithms_ (Cormen, Leiserson, & Rivest),
'Dynamic programming, like the divide-and-conquer method, solves
problems by combining the solutions to subproblems. ("Programming" in
this context refers to a tabular method, not to writing computer code.)
... Divide-and-conquer algorithms partition the problem into independant
subproblems, solve the problems recursively, and then combine their
solutions to solve the original problem.  In contrast, dynamic
programming is applicable when the subproblems are not independent..."

@_subject: ArcotSign (was Re: Does security depend on hardware?) 
According to the website, there's no pool of passwords.  There's a
truncated hash that will catch most mistakes, but is useless as a test
criterion in a dictionary attack.  If you get the user's "public" key,
then you can do a dictionary attack.  The user's "public" key isn't
public, however; not even the user knows it.  If I'm understanding it
right, it's stored encrypted and the key is only given to a set of
predefined servers.  Prior relationship must exist; they admit that.

@_subject: Known-plaintext attack on Encrypted Magic Folders 
Encrypted Magic Folders is a very popular shareware title from PC-Magic.
Magic Folders, its predecessor, was designed to intercept file IO
requests in Windows and return "File Not Found" if the file was in a
marked folder. It does this reasonably well, although booting into DOS
exposes all the files. To solve this problem, PC-Magic chose to roll
their own encryption. Reading the documentation about EMF's encryption
is frightening: as one cypherpunk put it, "Smells like snake oil, looks
like snake oil, it even has bits of snake scales in it." Here we show
that EMF is susceptible to a known-plaintext attack that needs as few as
768 bytes.
