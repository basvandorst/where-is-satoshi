@_subject: The Theory of the corporation 
There's a definition of government that one of my friends
routinely quotes to me.  I don't recall the original source,
but the quote goes something like this:
"A government is a group which holds a monopoly on violence,
particularly violence which results in fatality, over a
given geographic area."
It's terribly simplistic, but these days, accurate and
appropriate none the less.

@_subject: Factoring challenges considered boring 
The goal is to develop an architecture to allow access to
collective processing power.  Hopefully, much like this
mailing list, it will drive the establishment of a sense
of community and serve to reinforce a developing culture.
The reinforcement of the idea of community computing,
networking, and information, resources can help drive a
desire for a greater realization of those things and the
development of supporting group of people for extensions
of those ideas.  For example, ideas like FreeNet, which
are derived from the cryptoanarchist school of thought.
So, the answer to your question is that it's interesting
to me and I'm the one doing the programming.  If you can
come up with something more interesting I'll probably be
happy to work on it.  But I'm not really interested in
padding the pockets of the Lime Group, LCC. and I'm buzz
worded out on P2P. What I like is the idea of trying to
revitalize the cypherpunk movement - even a very tiny
little bit.
I'm really very disappointed with the Individual
Sovereignty/Cryptoanarchy subculture lately.  It seems
to be running out of steam.  There seems to be very few
people working on interesting things.  Coderpunks is a
ghost town with occasional spam rolling through like
a tumble weed, and cypherpunks seems to be obsessed
with Jim Bell like a bunch of little girls over the
back street boys.
Is anyone else writing code?

@_subject: Vinnie is looking for work.. 
At the cypherpunks meeting in SF during CodeCon, I think it was
Dave Del Torto who asked for a show of hands of punks looking
for work.  It was better than half.
With the economy starting to improve and rumors of a trickle of VC money, now might not be a bad time to try and launch a start
up. I know Sandy was trying to get something started down south.
I've been spending allot of time on cypherpunk type projects,
but with a day job progress has been slow and hard.  I'd be interested in joining a company to work on something that could translate into technical progress for the cypherpunk movement.
I think there's good opportunity in digital signature applications, PKI alternatives, and reputation systems.
Unfortunately, I don't see opportunity with electronic
currency - at least not in the US.

It's best not to contact the PTO or the patent holder with prior art.  Gregory Aharonian has written some interesting material on
this in his Patent News newsletter.
If you contact the patent holder or the PTO with the prior art,
it will likely be listed in the patent, or future patents if the
application has already been granted.  In the case of an existing
patents, presenting prior art to the PTO can result it the prior art being given a "previously reviewed" status.  Prior art
with a "previously reviewed" status, or prior art listed on the
patent are both much less effective in a defense case against an infringement claim.  Therefor alerting the patent holder or the
PTO to prior art would actually make the patent stronger and less
likely to be invalidated.
Basically, the patent system is so corrupt, the best thing to
do is to avoid participating it in.  Just like the US democratic

Archive it your selfs you fucking wankers.  Damn.  Since when
can cypherpunks not even handle setting up a public mailing
list archive?  If that's beyond you, you probably don't
belong on the cypherpunks list.
What do you need a government assistance program?  Some public
service announcements?  A welfare sponsored skills training

I don't even plan on subscribing myself.  I just wanted to get
the traffic off of cypherpunks.
Back when I first joined this list, cypherpunks where
known for making news, not reading it. I recognized some
addresses posting here recently from other lists that may
suggest a revival is possible if we can clean things up a
For the most part, the only people who subscribed to the
new list are the people who tend to forward news
announcements.  There seems to be very few consumers
(4 out of 7 subscribers on the new list - there's 8 total
so far, one person subscribed twice).

Given your requirements, you may want to run VMWare on a
Linux host computer.  The windows partition you'd like
to encrypt would then appear as a file in a Linux
partition which could be operated on by the tools and
technologies available for Linux.

At The Fifth HOPE a talk will be given on how to break
anonymity networks. Some commonly used p2p code such as
Tor and the remailers will be covered.
I cannot attend the conference.  Is anyone on the list going
who could report back?  I'm interested to hear if anything
other than what's already been widely published is covered
in this talk.
I'm working on a p2p anonymity project.

The Fifth HOPE, NYC July 9-11th, 2004
How To Break Anonymity Networks
Nick Mathewson
Today's anonymous communication software (such as Mixmaster, Mixminion,
Nymservers, JAP, Tor, Anonymizer, etc.) allows people to communicate
while concealing their identities from each other and from external
attackers. But no deployed system is strong enough to protect every
pattern of user behavior against a sufficiently resourceful adversary,
and many of them fall to far simpler attacks. In this talk, Nick will
discuss working attacks against today's anonymity networks, drawing from
past technical and social attacks on deployed networks and from recent
academic research in traffic analysis, stylometry, and mix-net design.
He will present defenses to these attacks when such defenses are known
to exist.
