Portrait dolls are dolls sculpted by Tammy Sharpe from clay.   Taken from a picture, a porcelain doll can be made to look like the person in the picture.   After the sculpt is done in clay,  molds will be made from plaster and then poured up in porcelain.    All Portrait dolls are one of a kind dolls and the molds are destroyed after doll is completed.   Wouldn't it be great to have a look-a-like doll made of someone you know?
