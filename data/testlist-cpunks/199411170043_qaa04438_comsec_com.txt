@_subject: Verifying RC4 
I suggest that someone apply for expedited export permission for some
small piece of software that uses the "apparent reverse-engineered
RC4".  Tell them that you want to export crypto software containing
RC4 on the 7-day plan.  The State Department will send you a set of
test-vectors which you can use to prove that you're really using the
real RC4.  If you pass, and are given export permission, then I guess
the rev-eng version is the real thing.  Be sure your keys are 40 bits
or less (only for purposes of the test export; I don't recommend short
keys for any other purpose).
Full bureaucratic details are at ftp://ftp.cygnus.com/pub/export/cjr.kit.
Search for "test vector".  This info is also reachable from my Web
page on crypto export, Please email me a full copy of any CJ that you submit, so I can add it
to the Web page (along with the eventual response from the gov't).
