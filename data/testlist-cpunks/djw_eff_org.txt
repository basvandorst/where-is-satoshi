@_subject: Government Accounting Office Report on Communications Privacy 
A few days ago, the Government Accounting Office (GAO) -- a pretty sharp
internal gov't investigative organization that's about a lot more than
accounting -- issued a report on communications privacy.  (Much of what's
in the report will probably raise of big "duh, we've been saying this for a
decade," from cypherpunks and other digerati, but it's still very important
to have the GAO saying this stuff.)
The report makes four very important findings:
1. Privacy-protecting technology (crytopgraphy) is increasingly important
for protecting the security of business communications and personal
information.  But federal policy is getting in the way of this technology.
"Increased use of computer and communications networks, computer literacy,
and dependence on information technology heighten US industries risk of
losing proprietary information to economic espionage.  In part to reduce
the risk, industry is more frequently using hardware and software with
encryption capabilities.  However, federal policies and actions stemming
from national security and law enforcement concerns hinder the use and the
export of U.S. commercial encryption technology and may hinder its
2. The NSA's role in this area is has been extensive, and possibly beyond
the spirit of the Computer Security Act. "Although the Computer Security Act of 1987 reaffirmed NIST's reponsibility
for developing federal information-processing standards for security of
sensitive, unclassified information, NIST follows NSA's lead in developing
certain cryptographic standards"
3. Opportunity for public input in the standards process has been
insufficient, leading to proposals like Clipper which lack public support.
"These policy issues are formulated and announced to the public, however,
with very little input from directly affected business interests, academia,
and others."
The report draws no specific policy conclusions, but provides excellent
ammunition for those of us who are trying to open up the standards process
and get export controls lifted.
Full text of the report (GAO/OSI-94-2 Communications Privacy: Federal
Policy and Actions) is supposed to be made available by ftp from GAO.  As
soon as it is, I'll let people know where it is.

October 12, 1993
House Foreign Affairs Committee

Hearing on mass market cryptography and export controls
Rep. Sam Gejdenson (D-Conn.), Chair
[A hopefully informative and probably biased account of the hearing by EFF]
Committee Members present:
Gejdenson, Cantwell (D-Wash.), Fingerhut (D-Ohio), Rohrbacher (R-Calif.)
Manzullo (R-Ill.) PANEL 1 (Open)
J. Hendren, Arkansas Systems (A data security firm that does a lot of
international banking work)
Ray Ozzie, IRIS Associates for Business Software Alliance (Lotus Notes
Stephen Walker, Trusted Information Systems for Software Publishers Association
Philip Zimmermann, PGP developer
Don Harbert, Digital Eqiupment Corp.
PANEL 2 (Secret Session)
NSA representative
Opening Statement of Gejdenson: "This hearing is about the well intentioned attempts of the National
Security Agency to try to control the uncontrollable....  The NSA itself
acknowledges that if you have a long distance telephone line and a modem,
you can send this software anywhere in the world.  If you have a computer
and a modem you can take this software off of the Internet anywhere in the
world....  I do not question the value of the information sought by the
National Security Agency.  But once it is determined that the dispersion of
this software cannot be controlled, then however much we might want to
protect our ability to obtain information, it is beyond our means to do so.
 Just as in the case of telecommunications, the National Security Agency is
attempting to put the genie back in the bottle.  It won't happen; and a
vibrant and productive sector of American indsutry may be sacrificed in the
The main points raised by witnesses were these:
1. DES and other strong encryption which is barred by ITAR is in the public
domain and available on the global market from foreign software
-Ray Ozzie used his laptop and a modem to show how to get a DES
implementation from ftp.germany.eu.net.  The committee loved it and most of
them seemed to understand what was going on on the screen, even though they
had never heard of ftp.
-Stephen Walker described the results of an SPA study which uncovered over
250 cryptography packages which offer DES-based or stronger algorithms.
-Phil Zimmermann testified that he designed PGP from publicly available
2. Foreign DES implementations are just as good as US versions. Surprisingly enough, this is a contentious issue.  Some members of the
committee seemed to have been told by someone or another that foreign
versions of DES may not be as strong as those that are made in the USA.  If
this were true, then export controls might still be justified despite the
numerous foreign versions of DES on the market.  In my view, this is a
pretty desperate argument.
-Steve Walker demonstrated that all DES works the same way by encrypting a
passage from Mozart's Eine Kleine Nachtmusik with several different foreign
DES packages, and then decrypting them.  Surprise!  They all sounded just
the same.
3. Lots of money is being lost by US software/hardware vendors:
-Don Harbert from DEC told of loses of over $70 Million in just the last
few months.
-BSA estimates that export controls exclude access to a global market the
is $6-9 Billion.
4. People want their privacy
-Phil Zimmermann told the committee about his experience with PGP users and
how badly people need and want to protect their privacy in electronic
Committee Responses:
Overall, the committee was quite sympathetic to the witnesses.  Chairman
Gejdenson seemed very supportive of changing export controls.  Rep. Dana
Rohrbacher, no flaming liberal, said, "the cold war is over.  I sympathize
with everything that has been said here."  Daniel J. Weitzner, Senior Staff Counsel Electronic Frontier Foundation

@_subject: Satellites, the NSA, & Clipper 
I just returned from a presentation at Comsat about Clipper and other
crypto issues.  They asked EFF & NIST to come and square off before them so
that they could begin to think about the issues.  They may not get too
deeply involved, but most of the manufacturers & users represented seemed
quite sympathetic to our position.  I also picked up an amusing tidbit.  All satellites that carry US
government traffic must have an NSA-designed black box which secures the
satellite control channel from enemy interference (ie. Libya tries to move
US satellites around to screw up our communications).
Guess who builds the black box.  You got it, Mykotronx.

Part of waking up and smelling the coffee is realizing that there IS a
government out there which makes and enforces laws which have an impact on
all of us.  Now I happen to believe that, on balance, it's a good thing to
have a government that is at least marginally representative.  But even if
I didn't believe that, I would believe that we should be working to change
laws that screw up our lives.

@_subject: FLASH: FBI's Draft Digital Telephony Bill: EFF Summary and Analysis 
Electronic Frontier Foundation Statement on FBI Draft Digital Telephony Bill
        EFF has received a draft of the FBI's new, proposed "Digital
Telephony" bill.  After initial analysis, we strongly condemn bill, which
would require all common carriers to construct their networks to deliver to
law enforcement agencies, in real time, both the contents of all
communications on their networks and the "signalling" or transactional
information.          In short, the bill lays the groundwork for turning the National
Information Infrastructure into a nation-wide surveillance system, to be
used by law enforcement with few technical or legal safeguards.  This image
is not hyperbole, but a real assessment of the power of the technology and
inadequacy of current legal and technical privacy protections for users of
communications networks.
        Although the FBI suggests that the bill is primarily designed to
maintain status quo wiretap capability in the face of technological
changes, in fact, it seeks vast new surveillance and monitoring tools. Among the new powers given to law enforcement are:
1. Real-time access to transactional information creates the ability to
monitor individuals in real time.
        The bill would require common carrier network (telephone companies
and anyone who plans to get into the telephone business, such as cable TV
companies) to deliver, in real time, so called "call setup information." In the simplest case, call setup information is a list of phone numbers
dialed by a given telephone currently under surveillance.  As we all come
to use electronic communications for more and more purposes, however, this
simple call setup information could also reveal what movies we've order,
which online information services we've connected to, which political
bulletin boards we've dialed, etc. With increasing use of
telecommunications, this simple transactional information reveals almost as
much about our private lives as would be learned if someone literally
followed us around on the street, watching our every move.
        We are all especially vulnerable to this kind of surveillance,
because, unlike wiretapping the *content* of our communications, it is
quite easy for law enforcement to get permission to obtain this
transactional information.  Whereas courts scrutinize wiretap requests very
carefully, authorizations for access to call setup information are
routinely granted with no substantive review.  Some federal agencies, such
as the IRS, even have the power to issue administrative subpoenas on their
own, without appearing before a court.          The real impact of the FBI proposal turns, in part, on the fact
that it is easy to obtain court approval for seizing transactional data.
       The change from existing law contained in the FBI proposal is that
carriers would have to deliver this call setup information *in real time*,
directly to a remote listening post designated by law enforcement.  Today,
the government can obtain this information, but generally has to install a
device (called a 'pen register') which is monitored manually at the
telephone company switching office.
2. Access to communication and signalling information for any mobile
communication, regardless of location allows tracking of an individual's
        The bill requires that carriers be able to deliver either the
contents or transactional information associated with any subscriber, even
if that person is moving around from place to place with a cellular or PCS
phone.  It is conceivable that law enforcement could use the signalling
information to identify that location of a target, whether that person is
the subject of a wiretap order, or merely a subpoena for call setup
        This provision takes a major step beyond current law in that it
allows for a tap and/or trace on a *person*, as opposed to mere
surveillance of a telephone line.
3. Expanded access to electronic communications services, such as the
Internet, online information services, and BBSs.
        The privacy of electronic communications services such as
electronic mail is also put at grave risk.  Today, a court order is
required under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act to obtain the
contents of electronic mail, for example.  Those ECPA provisions would
still apply for the contents of such messages, but the FBI bill suggests
that common carriers might be responsible for delivering the addressing
information associated with electronic mail and other electronic
communications.  For example, if a user connects to the Internet over local
telephone lines, law enforcement might be able to demand from the telephone
company information about where the user sent messages, and into which
remote systems that user connects.  All of this information could be
obtained by law enforcement without every receiving a wiretap order.
4. The power to shut down non-compliant networks
        Finally, the bill proposes that the Attorney General have the power
to shut down any common carrier service that fails to comply with all of
these requirements.  Some have already called this the "war powers"
provision.  Granting the Department of Justice such control over our
nation's communications infrastructure is a serious threat to our First
Amendment right to send and receive information, free from undue government
