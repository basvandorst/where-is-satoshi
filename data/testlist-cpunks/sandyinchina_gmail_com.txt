@_subject: Status of opportunistic encryption 
Some years back I worked on the FreeS/WAN project (freeswan.org),
IPsec for Linux.
One of our goals was to implement "opportunistic encryption", to allow any
appropriately set up machines to communicate securely, without
between the two system administrators. Put authentication keys in DNS; they
look those up and can then use IKE to do authenticated Diffie-Hellman to
the keys for secure links.
Recent news stories seem to me to make it obvious that anyone with privacy
concerns (i.e. more-or-less everyone) should be encrypting as much of their
communication as possible. Implementing opportunistic encryption is the
best way I know of to do that for the Internet.
I'm somewhat out of touch, though, so I do not know to what extent people
are using it now. That is my question here.
I do note that there are some relevant RFCs.
RFC 4322 Opportunistic Encryption using the Internet Key Exchange (IKE)
RFC 4025 A Method for Storing IPsec Keying Material in DNS
and that both of FreeS/WAN's successor projects (openswan.org and
strongswan.org) mention it in their docs. However, I don't know if it
actually being used.

@_subject: [Freedombox-discuss] [James Vasile] tinc rollout and fbox 
Their docs include this paragraph:
" On the 15th of September 2003, Peter Gutmann posted a security
analysis of tinc 1.0.1. He argues that the 32 bit sequence number used
by tinc is not a good IV, that tinc’s default length of 4 bytes for
the MAC is too short, and he doesn’t like tinc’s use of RSA during
authentication. We do not know of a security hole in this version of
tinc, but tinc’s security is not as strong as TLS or IPsec. We will
address these issues in tinc 2.0.
Gutmann is a well-known and respected expert. His best-known
paper was one back in the 90s on reading "erased" disk drives
and what bit patterns it took to block that. Most "secure erase"
utilities around use those suggestions (even though current
drives are quite different, so those may be inappropriate now).
He has done /a lot/ of other stuff as well.
The current Tinc release is 1.0.21
My reading of that is that Tinc has known problems and
they probably will not be fixed soon. To me, that means
it is not ready for serious consideration as a component
for FreedomBox.

@_subject: Metadata anonymization through time delayed email messaging. 
References: if you control the end-user sending machine & it runs some sort of Unix,
this is trivial; the required command is just:
at 04:00 mail whoever at example.net < message_file
Writing a script to do this using a random time would not be hard.
Of course this does not encrypt the file, though it could send a file
that was already encrypted. Nor does it provide any sort of
protection against someone who can snoop on the sending
machine (nothing I know of does!), so it does not work in your
Internet cafe example.
Better to modify the mail server to introduce a random delay.
This also does not look hard. Avoiding time stamps in the
Received: lines in the headers would also be necessary,
but that looks straightforward as well.
To block tracking, you also want to avoid putting the client
machine's IP address in the headers. Easily done, but it
makes it harder to deal with spammers.

It is the sender's job. No-one should be sending such stuff
to a public list since it serves no useful purpose. If your
client won't send clean ASCII-only email, then switch to
a client that will.
If senders do not do that, there are four options: flame
them to a crisp (off-list, please!), let every reader handle
it, remove the HTML at the server, or set the server to
drop such messages entirely. I'd prefer the last, with
an appropriate bounce message,

@_subject: Curious RNG stalemate [was: use of cpunks] 
References: If you have an audio device free or can add one and are using
Linux, I'd say Turbid is the obvious solution:
Open source, available for over a decade, well thought out
and well documented. It even has a proof, using only some
quite mild assumptions, that it gives almost perfect entropy
in the output. What's not to like?
If you are on Linux, getting Turbid into your distro might
well be the most important RNG work you could do. For
If you are concerned with other systems, it might well
be worth considering whether Turbid could be ported.
It appears better than anything else I have seen
because it is the only one with a proof of randomness,
and as far as I can tell the proof is solid.

There is configuration info for some common sound devices.
Only people with a device for which a configuration file does
not already exist. If you have to do this, you can send your
file to the Turbid maintainer so others can use it without
having to do the measurements themselves.
Of course, then there is a trust issue. The maintainer may
not have the device in question, so he cannot verify. If
you want to verify, you are back to building a cable.
Without verification, it looks as though someone could
subvert Turbid for a device by submitting a suitably
bogus parameter file.
I'd also like to see a default parameter file, guaranteed
to give some entropy on a lowest common denominator
device. I'm not sure if that is possible.

@_subject: Introduction to crypto 
References: That's not a good combination.
" As for databases and real-time programming, cryptography looks
deceptively simple. The basic ideas are indeed simple and almost any
programmer can fairly easily implement something that handles
straightforward cases. However, as in the other fields, there are also
some quite tricky aspects to the problems and anyone who tackles the
hard cases without both some study of relevant theory and considerable
practical experience is almost certain to get it wrong. This is
demonstrated far too often.
I'd say start with Ross Anderson's book. The 1st edition is online & free:
Either a bookstore or a university library should have the 2nd
edition, which I'm told is even better.
