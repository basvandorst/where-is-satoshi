<<"In other words it was stvation/devastation city">>
  It was lot worse than that on the Japanese-imperialits occupied islands of the Pacific when the Nisei troops choosenot to surrender and instead, mad last-ditch charges against AMerican lines - which killed not a small number of Americans. And of course, there were the suicide bombers.
Submarine operations don't cost zero lives, either. In fact, just plain old regular military logistics - keeping the boys mobilized and in place ina theatre of operations - don't cost zero lives, even if there are _no_ And while all the starvation and devastation was going on in Japanese
cities, the Japanese troops were torturing and murdering Allied POWs, and
Asian civilains in all the Japanese-occupied teritories. Those people
deserved liberation, too. I think you give your game away when you complain about how we were being unfair to Comrade Stalin.
As far as Pax Americana goes, the Japanese just _volunteered_ to_increase_
the payments they make to support the American garrison in Japan. The
non-Okinawans want us in their country. I guess they know that the
alternative is a Red Chinese garrison. And lots of other Asians are afraid of the same alternative - or of Japanese garrisons in their homeland. THey've "been there, done that".
