Is there a viable third party candidate that I am unaware of?  Other
than Badnarik, that is.
Being still currently undecided myself (although living in one of the
32 or so 'pre-ordained' states) I found this speech to be "most
cynical, opportunistic, divisive, and un-American" ones I've listend
to in awhile.  (At least since the ones in Boston last week).  I don't
expect any better from the ones in NYC the fisrt week of september,
I hope you're right, and that a Kerry administration would be more
reasonable.  From what he's said, however, I *am* cynical.  In a
nutshell, he would;
-Continue the war in Iraq (Which he voted for as senator)
-Continue the Patriot Act (Which he voted for as senator)
-Raise taxes and increase spending
-Increase entitlements
-Prostrate the US to the UN and Europe
Of other important policy decisions, he can't be pinned down to a
specific answer.
So now I can vote for Jack Johnson (Yale grad, skull & bones member,
rich due to inheritance) or John Jackson (ditto).  Pardon me for
failing to see a difference.  There is no more Democratic Party, or a
Republican Party.  There is only the Bureaocratic Party, beholden to
themselves, worried only about their own perks and power.  If you
believe otherwise, then you've drank the Kool-aid too.

That was a direct quote from Howie Goodell's reply to me.  I found it
interesting that while the left continues to rail against everything
Bush does, they use many (if not all) of the same tactics.  Yet they
are blind to that fact (willfully so).
Neither side is willing to agree or concede on *any* point.  While not
a definition of 'un-american' in itself, is sure is a symptom.

As the article notes, GWB *improved* his showing in NY over the 2000
election.  Are you implying that the US won't be attacked again?
I could follow your ad-hominem attack with one about mincing
homosexuals, but we both know that singlularity of voters on either
side is incorrect, and does nothing to forward the discussion.
Of course it does.  That's what a republic is.  But who's going to
'indict' us?  The UN?  Maybe after we finish the trials for their
self-dealing on the 'Oil for Food' program (as Orwellian a title as
the Patriot Act had).

What percentage of Kerry supporters are supporters, and not just an
anti-Bush vote?
This is my point.  He hasn't done *everything* wrong, yet given the
shrill denouncements from both sides, you'd think that both the
candidates were complete morons.  I'd think there would be some
measured discussion on this list, but its the same slogans spewed out.
Do you really think Kerry wouldnt have signed the Patriot Act if he
was president?  Federalized the drivers license requirements?  Pushed
for socialized medicine with central controls?  Kerry or Bush, Kang or
Kodos, in the end it means the same thing.
