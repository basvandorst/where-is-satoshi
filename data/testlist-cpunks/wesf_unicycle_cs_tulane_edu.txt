@_subject: Moto Secure Clear digital? 
I just got a second phone line, and decided that if I was going to get a 2-line
phone it might as well be a good one, so I am considering a Motorola Secure Clear cordless 2-line phone with speakerphone. This will be quite an investment,so I was wondering whether the Secure Clear phones are digitally encrypted or
merely scrambled using some analog method. Anybody know about this? How secure
are these phones really? --Wes

I speak for no one.
Trust no one. Cryptography is outlawed and only the outlaws care.
When thinking is outlawed, maybe then somebody will care.
