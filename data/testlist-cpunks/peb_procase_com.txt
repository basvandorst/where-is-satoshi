I vote for cryptoprivacy because it is more appropriate, and due to
recent events, it helps to be clear about these things when the media
gets involved.
Examples: 1.  The infamous CBS coverage of the Hacker's Conference that turned
  "Cracker" Conference in the nightly news regardless of what the   reporters were told.
2. Notice how the NIST press release said ``This system is more secure
than many other voice encryption systems readily available today.
[^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ not claiming the best]
While the algorithm will remain classified to protect the security of
the key escrow.'' but the Knight-Ridder translated this into:
``...National Security Agency invented a new coding device, called the
"Clipper Chip," which is said to be much harder to crack than encoding
systems now on the market.
Now the wiretap chip sounds better than any equipment on the market
rather than "better than many" which is a very weak claim. Happens all the time.  Information must be very clear.  Punk isn't

Okay, here are my sound bytes:
1. The long one (needed when they try to outlaw encryption):
As we move into the electronic frontier, the freedom to use crypto-privacy technology is becoming the equivalent to the right to bear arms:
it is the last line of defense against a tyrannic government.  The good news is that privacy is a defensive technology, not an offensive one.
Giving up this un-enumerated right could be disasterous to future 2. The short one (simple-minded Clipper is no good):
Crypto Privacy is like a bullet proof vest for your transmitted speech; the Clipper chip is a paper jacket with extra zippers in the back.

@_subject: Free Speech 
What do people think about crypto being considered Free Speech?  This might be the most powerful angle.  Freedom of expression would be a
great way to protest a ban on hard crypto; detecting the use of
crypto on the Internet would be like Prodigy monitoring all news
groups for non-family (and non-Prodigy) material.  Not only that, but if the proported crypto material wasn't actually crypto but
random bits, then no laws would be broken.  The next step for the tyrant in this arms race is to send messages that
merely appear to contain crypto illegal.  By analogy, the FCC can fine
people for joking about the metal detector and xray equipment security
check points.  I don't know if this is a law, but the FCC could enforce
its fine by not allowing you to fly again on a commercial airline.
(Monopolies, they work just great. ;^)
A further step in this scenario is for the pro-free-speech people
to start using various data compression techniques--a proliferation
of non-standards for various reasons (well, C++ compression
could be specialized--no dictionary need be sent if the reciever
knows it is C++; same for English used on particular news groups, poetry, etc.).
This would cause massive false positives of packets that appear to be
encrypted.  Obviously, fairly enforcing a law against such usage would be
I can see two outcomes at this stage: (1) the laws are eliminated, or
(2) they are enforced only selectively.  Considering the way things
usually work, (2) seems more likely, however the fact that the merger of phones and computers is already happening (e.g., Sun ss10 with ISDN
has a complete phone answering system written by Jeff Peck at Sun), the volume of resistance can easily be *large* and *convenient*.  Few
protests are convenient; with this, people don't even have to leave work!  (The downside is, however, that it would be difficult to get
media attention for doing it...TV camera pointed at the workstation,
OK, I'm pressing the Send button now.  Hah!  Take that!)
If the powers-that-be then come up with a law that crypto is illegal only
if used for illegal activity, I wouldn't complain so much.  Changing
your name is legal as long as you don't commit fraud, so there are
tolerable examples of this type of law now.  Paul E. Baclace

@_subject: The Family Key 
I was about to say this myself too, but Hellman already pointed it out.
However, it is worth mentioning for emphasis.
The Family key is known not only to the NSA, but to the FBI with their
black box units.  No special protection is given to this key and it
allows the equivalent of Caller-ID *and* Callee-ID over all transmissions
using Clipper regardless of how the calls are routed.  This is *much*
cheaper than speaker recognition used in roving wiretaps!  Roving wire
taps are given out sparingly, but it seems that Clipper would make the scanning of huge numbers of calls and saving traffic info the normal
mode of operation.
In my letter to Casa Blanca I mentioned that I noticed this deception in the NIST press release.
Another feature of the F key is that it could be changed in new runs of
chip making, but evidently, protecting F is not a great concern by
NIST/FBI, et al. The 3, 34 bit pads, if/when the entire system is
entirely compromised, could be changed--in fact they could do it regularly
anyway--they can keep a list of Serial number to pad mappings.  This
would prevent the system from entirely being compromised by an outside
[NSA] entity, so it is somewhat robust to that possibility.

Yesterday on American Public Radio (used to be called NPR?) reported

If they can't get this kind of bill passed, then they probably will not approve the technology for export.

Not with CCD cameras.
All the other methods you mentioned require special physical access--
it won't work if one gets photographed while placing post-its on the

The high error rates of image recognition make this whole scenario
a future issue.  One FAA funded experiment used mice to detect excessive adeneline (the mice go nuts or their heart rates increase
just by smelling the excitement); the idea was to catch hijackers
who would generally be a bit excited.  This sounds obvious boneheaded
because of all the people who fear flying...but the stated reason
for abandoning the research was that mice don't rate too well as
anonymous tipsters!  Anyway, the error rate was very high too.
However, the whole "profile" thing used by the WoD is essentially a
conscious application of generalization that neural networks do.  This
may expand if "suspicion detection" is socially acceptable--my guess
is that it would not be accepted given the speeding ticket automation
systems that have been widely rejected (they probably could have gotten
it accepted if the reduced a speeding ticket cost by a magnitude and considered it like a parking ticket--but these are legal changes, not
technological changes, so they are much more difficult to do).
The OCR of cash serial numbers would be highly probabilistic--that is,
too many transactions would not be tracked so the knowledge of the flow
would be partial.  More likely would be that all large cash deposits
would be scanned for general analysis just as large cash transactions require that a bank fill out a special form and send to the State.  Paul E. Baclace

Using a GA to drive a brute force key search would certainly not help:
the fitness surface has a needle in a haystack (spike).  This kind of
problem has been identified as "unlearnable" by theoreticians like Valiant at Harvard.
However, using a GA to drive a more intelligent cryptanalysis that has
partial results *would* help.  It seems that cryptanalysis benefits from human assistance due our excellent abilities at recognition of partial
solutions.  Because of this, a GA could help automate the cryptanalysis
(My knowledge of cryptanalysis ends at the Enigma machine breaker cbw
(crypt breakers workbench in comp.sources.unix archives) which uses an
interative process where partial results are visible and are used to guide
new guesses.  The Enigma machine does state-machine substitution, but no diffusion/mixing/scrambling; lack of the latter makes visual recognition much simpler.  Since DES uses scrambling, I'm not sure whether
partial results are possible.)
Crossover of the genome is the key part of "avoiding hill-climbing" and it the key ingredient to Holland's proof of a super-linear speedup (thus "violating"
Amdahl's Law of parallelization never attaining a linear speedup) otherwise known as implicit parallelism.  Holland's proof of this in the '70s opened up research in GAs because of this attractive feature.  [Note that it requires
certain assumptions about independence and stasis of the bits in the genome
to make the proof tractable, but the hope is that this will still be useful
for real problems.]

Sounds like Bugajsky creates a generative grammar and then stores list
of productions that specifies a walk on the tree to extract data.  This
is a form of Kolmogorov Complexity compression, which has been expanded
upon most notably by Chaitin.  In the general case, the program could
be for a Turing complete machine: e.g., if I want to compress
3.14159265..., the compression algorithm could recognize the sequence
and give an essentially infinite compression if you want an infinite
number of digits (that's right, my patented algorithm can compress your
data, as found inside pi, to 0.0000000000000% of original size!  Oops,
pi can't be patented, well, then I'll have to use the mumble secret
sequence which can be patented! ;^)
I wonder whether Bugajsky includes the size of his grammar in the compressed
size...if he doesn't then his 0.5% non-lossy compression is overstated.
Barnsley fractal compression achieves very high compression rates like
this, but it could take days to compress one picture (of course, faster
compression algorithms exist that don't compress as much).  JPEG can get
very high compression rates if loss of exact data is okay (which it is
for pictures).  And yet another lossy compression example is Sony's MiniDisc
which biases to the loss of data to areas that are difficult for most humans to recognize.

An altered version of a photo would presumably have a different hash,
but it would not have an earlier timestamp hash.  Insofar as one could
recognize that an image was incorporated into another altered image,
misappropriated and stolen copyrights could be detected.  Recognition
is inherent in this process. This isn't very different from sound
sampling: if the alteration completely obscures the orignal beyond
recognition, then there isn't much of a case to prove theft.  For a
picture example, I could digitize a copyrighted image and use *only*

Use of phone, desk, email, bathroom, grounds, chairs, kitchen, are all
company facilities that are necessary for working for a company, but it
is widely accepted that they can also be used personally as perks.  At
the extreme of a perk-that-is-necessary is "calling your doctor".  This
is not company business, but if you can't make such calls at the
office, you end up working less in order to get around such
restrictions.  The other extreme is something that takes up company
resources due to purely individual convenience: posting to usenet for
personal business.  This can be done via a private account and does not
have to be done from the office, but many companies allow this because
they also expect people to work overtime for free and this keeps them at work. Depending upon many factors at a company, the amount of perk usage
allowed varies.  Some companies have policies about this while
others do not.  I think the reason no policy exists in many places
is that defining it is a form of encouragement (like saying you
have exactly 5 sick days a year, and they don't carry over to the
next; this causes people to call in sick even when they are not.
One company I worked for took sick days out of your vacation days
(but you got more vacation days than was ordinary); this encouraged
honesty, but also led to sick people coming to work).  This gets into the disclaimer bit.  I *never* assume a person
is speaking for the company unless they are making a product
announcement; for anything else, it is fairly easy to see that
postings are personal (even if they regard business related subjects like commendts about the quality of particular software).
It would be far easier for everyone to assume that no messages represent the company, board of directors, etc., unless explicitly
stated as such, simply because official messages are rare and personal/unofficial ones are frequent.
The cost of accounting/surveillance/policing/ill-will must be balanced with the benefits of having a trusting/open/honest/self-policed-perks
policy; this is a tradeoff all organizations must make and has nothing to do
with free markets.  Libertarian thought doesn't say anything about this

If the key is unknown, then the meaning or affect of the message on the

Alarm systems use duress codes for this that trigger a silent alarm
when the password is entered.  I'm not sure the proposed system here
(a capability system) could have an extra channel that the bad guys don't know about.
Using a hierarchy of escrow agents would be interesting--then by calling me up for part of the key would require me to get back to you after I called up the person at the next level.  (Note that a hierarchy is a special case of a general graph, so the webs of trust idea is important here (could provide some redundancy).)
Now, back to Steve's actual question,
Ultimately, there is no proof you are not currently a simulation on a big computer.  Why is time travel is not possible?  It's too expensive on the current platform.  (E.g, if SimEarth inhabitants could time travel, you would have a hard time keeping track of what they did and your machine would slow down considerably).
On an upload, how many people can be in the same room?  Can you
make arbitrary video phone calls?  Anything that stretches the compute resources could potentially make the bad guys impatient
and blow their trojan horse universe.

This is speaker recognition, not voice recognition.  It turns out that
the problem is solved in a very different way for each; voice recognition, in order to be speaker independent, must throw out
the information that makes it possible to do speaker recognition
(and vice versa: the latter does not need some of the information that the former needs).
This is used in "roving wiretaps" that apparently are used infrequently
as they scan whole exchanges or number sets (e.g., all payphones in some city).  The idea is to capture phone calls from the suspects that
are savvy enough to know that they are being tapped.  At least one
Mob boss was caught this way (in Los Angeles, I think, about 4-5

It occurred to me that determining whether a set of random bytes is
actually a crypto message could be reduced to the halting problem.
Given this, it would be theoretically impossible to prove that an
uncrackable message was indeed a crypto message.  The revelation here
(for me, anyway) is that if arbitrary crypto were made illegal, the
burden of proof would be on the prosecution which would have to crack
the message (at least partially).

Well, I was considering this an unknown--that is, the cryptoanalyzer
does *not* know the particular Turing machine, so it is an arbitrary
machine, although the program is finite.  That is, I am suggesting
a decrypt-machine that is turing-complete, however, as:
points out:
a practical crypto algorithm must allow decrypt in P time and since NP
problems do theoretically halt, then the halting problem is not a blanket defense. The realities Brian.Hawthorne at East.Sun.COM mentions are all too real:
Anonymous remailers could be effectively broken by requiring
tracability (say, they way banks must fill out special forms for any
transaction over $10k (which is why Oliver North sent money to the
Contras in $9.7k packets)); in the same law, the remailer would be shut
down if it did not comply.  I think the widespread use of video phones
would make steganography easier, however.

@_subject: Neural Nets to decrypt? 
In my experience, neural nets are good at generalizing across sparse
data for recognizing patterns not seen before.  GAs are more useful
for converging (at an exponential rate giving Holland's schema theorem)
on a solution to a problem.  A GA is easier to train if the score is
a continuous real number while most neural network implementations expect actual examples of what is in the set of things to be recognized.
For a GA cryptoanalysis tool, a vector representing an experiment
would be used as a genotype and the result could be the output of a specialized message detector (==1 if the text looks like plain English, ==.0001 if only a few words are seen, etc. (and of course
it would need to detect file formats like that of compress)).  Given
this, a GA could find a solution.  However, in learning theory, there are problems considered to be
unlearnable and the standard example is encrypted information!  The
solution space could be like a plane with a single "needle" in it that
is the solution with no hills in the general direction of the needle.
This kind of solution space requires exhaustive search, unfortunately.
It is difficult to characterize a solution space, but it is the key
part--the mapping of a gene vector to a fraction representing the
completeness of the solution is critical--and if it is completely
flat with a needle, then it is not worth it.  Alternatively, if it
is completely random, then it also is not worth it.  The solution space must be somewhere in these two extremes to be useful for a GA.
Based on my limited experience with cbw (crypt breakers workbench), it is possible to get partial results (e.g., ex*lo*e -> explore and
other words are then filled in) and zoom in the full solution,
so based on that, a GA would be helpful.  cbw is for an Enigma type
machine and newer algorithms are much more sophisticated, so I don't know if the same kind of partial knowledge applies for RSA, DES3, IDEA cracking.

@_subject: cypto + compression 
If your compression algorithm is any good, it should *not* be able to compress the output a second time. Compressing before encryption is vital--it makes brute force and plaintext
attacks much more difficult.
On compression forever:  I read a science fiction short story once where
(not sure of title or author, but it is a classic) a bunch of geniuses are ostensibly sent to another planet to "explore", but the people sending
them had a different motive: get them away from Earth and give them time
to dream up cool stuff.  Okay, so they dream up way cool stuff, but have
this problem with transmission bandwidth back to Earth.
Then they figure out that any message can be encoded in prime numbers
like:  2^a * 3^b * 5^c * 7^d...   where a b c d are the character values
(ascii or letter A==0, B==1, etc.).  After a message is encoded, the
result is a *big number*.  This number is not more compact than
the original message, but the clever geniuses flying to Tau Ceti (or wherever) figured out how to factor the number down to things like
M^N + P^Q, where the number of bits needed to write down the factorization
was very small, say, 100 bits or so.  THEN, they ship this factorization
back to Earth and save bandwidth and it encodes the whole Encyclopedia
Gallactica. This scheme doesn't work because factoring is much harder than using other compression techniques.  Paul E. Baclace

Yes, this is worth pointing out; the main idea is to keep the opponent from knowing the format.  Increasing the entropy via
compressions is good in its own right since it makes the encoding
more complex and provides more stumbling blocks.
Cypher chaining seems to be even better for confounding opponents, but I'll let someone else commment on that.

sense, such repression lasted a long time.  (And in the U.S., it has
been said that color copiers are tracked, but this sounds like a bluff
to me since a color scanner+color printer is sufficient to duplicate
that capability.  Is it possible to buy a color copier anonymously?) Given this, it *is* possible that freedom of expression is going to win eventually.  Anonymous digital cash is more likely to be compromised

Non-gold backed currency is reputation based.  The debasement of a reputation
based currency looks a lot like the game theory strategy of "tit for tat, but
if you can get away with tricking them, go for it"; the tit for tat is needed
to keep the reputation and works both ways: (1) if a currency issuer debases value relative to another currency issuer, people will switch money to the better
currency (switching to a better reputation issuer, if possible), (2) counterfeiters
are tracked down and stopped to uphold the reputation.  The "if you can get away with tricking them, go for it" can be easily be performed
when major currency issuers work together to debase all at the same time.
Luckily, this kind of collusion doesn't hold together well (like OPEC).
So we already have reputation based currency as represented by hard to reproduce
paper.  Similarly, a reputation based digital deposit could be built that is
based on ordinary currency.  (I view anonymous transaction as being completely
orthogonal to this.)
