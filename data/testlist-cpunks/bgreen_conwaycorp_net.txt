Actually, gone missing has been in common usage in my home area for the past
20 years at least.  My home area being southwestern Arkansas.  This may be
the reason that it has shown up on the news broadcasts for the Texas
fugitives.  Maybe it has already been in use in this small, little part of
the country for awhile.

I have a suggestion:  Jim is free to ignore us and we are free to ignore
him.  If you don't like what he says....ignore him.  You can even set up a
rule to automatically delete any of his notes once it hits your mailbox.
How about posting something that has to do with cyphers?
