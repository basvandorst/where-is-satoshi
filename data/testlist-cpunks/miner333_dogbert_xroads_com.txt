There was an article in the WSJ about this recently, TX has passed a law
that goes into effect Sept. 1ST that will make publiclink illegal, they
said they would continue to run the site and see what happens in court.
Don't remember the date of the article.

@_subject: Making OCR'ed code transfer easier 
A month or two ago someone related their experience with OCRing code and
getting it to work; even when it compiled correctly there were still subtle
errors that he/she had to spend hours finding. With the recent threads on
OCRing the DES cracker I was thinking of ways to make it more foolproof
without going so far that the FEDs would get excited. If the author/publisher was to include a hash of the source code the person
doing the scanning would know when it was good without having to compile it
and then run it to discover there were still errors in the source. A hash
per page of code would be even easier as it would localize the errors to a
more manageable area, or even more sophisticated methods could be used to
localize any errors.
How far you could go in providing feedback on the correctness of the OCR
process without getting the FEDs all excited is the question.
Just a thought

@_subject: Interesting Statistic in WSJ 
% of labor pool working for S&P500 companies = 14 %
% of labor pool working for government = 14.5%
S&P500 increase in productivity is running about 3.9%/year
Government 0.5% per year.
The 0.5% is probably attributed to the ever increasing number of citizen
units that end up in a prison working for 55 cents an hour, 1,000,000 plus
units and counting.
Do they offer licence plate stamping courses in jc?

@_subject: Latest Clinton dodge? 
Doesn't gennifer flowers has(had?) an audio tape of clinton asking her to
deny their affair, there is no proof, etc.? I think a sequence of that
audio and then the above statement played maybe 10 times on CNN would make
a nice piece of news.
