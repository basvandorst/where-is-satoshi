   I'm an admin for a lot of groups. Those groups are run on Yahoo,
Google, as well as some that are run on private mailman machines. The
question keeps coming up... what is the alternative?
   This looks very interesting. Thank you, i will have to look into it.
   But, back to the question: How/where can someone run a simple
(ignoring the sign-up required by Yahoo/Google/etc.), public, free
(both ways, because paying would require identification) forum,
allowing for anonymous posts (but not allowing it to be overrun by
trolls), that has a simple searchable (and findable - as in searched
by Google, Yahoo, etc.) archive?
   You still have to trust a privately run forum. Trust, as in, will
it be censored, altered, still there after the volunteer gets tired of
it, etc.?
   In other words, if you want a private discussion group about

    Thank you very much for this description of what happened. I am a
nerd AND a member of the QUILTBAG community. I saw it happen, and so
quickly that there was no time to react. I vaguely remember that i heard
about the critique, and he had already resigned 3 days later! There was
literally no time for "educating" the QUILTBAG community. The whole
thing was a fiasco for "freedom". I feel i have to state that i can work
with people i disagree with (up to a certain degree) and that Brendan
EICH was no monster, just "uneducated" about *my* perspective.
    Which points to the bigger question of education: non-nerds need to
learn the value of those invisible computers that connect the world;
some nerds need to learn the value of "open"; some people need to learn
to work together with people they disagree with; and some people need to
learn the value of diversity. Whew. I'm exhausted, and i'm sure my list
is not even complete.

   I agree.
   Are you serious?
   Von MISES? How would you distinguish between Anarchism and
Libertarianism (and nihilism)?
