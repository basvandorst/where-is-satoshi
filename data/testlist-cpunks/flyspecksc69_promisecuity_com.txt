i think they are so cute i love her litte handwriting and she is beyond excited to pass them out some other projects she and i looked at but didnt get around to (of course) from martha (of course)
me um we didnt have computers in our homes then
guess what i finally put in the shop
ten months after we were married i was a stay at home mom living the student life again while grant went back to school a few months later another unplanned event- my mom passed away suddenly we lived on a corner in a typical oc tract neighborhood you love him too right
again happy things
i remember that too it was really fun i hope it gets warm again real soon i cant wait to go to the park again with you two love mom
i couldnt find a video of him performing it but listen to the lyrics what an adventure it is
the deal with pcos and carbs
what a few hours on a sunny day can do for you
cate what did you play on the computer then
it was the first time i realized that things dont always go how you think they will and that it all can turn out better than you imagined
i swear nothing makes me happier than a peaceful space and some needles it makes me too happy drawers full of yarn too glorious
from toast
