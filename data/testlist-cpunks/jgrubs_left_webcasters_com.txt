The public keyrings at MIT and Uni-Hamburg haven't been updated since August.
Does anyone know why?

Keep in mind that all they are really trying to save are their "lines" in the
annual budget bill. Transfer them to another agency with the same pay and
bennies, and we'll all be happier. The International Whaling Commission comes

refurbished software I wrote last year to generate a RFC-1153 compatible

anyone wants it, send e-mail.

@_subject: Lack of secrecy in U.S. Banks 
As a former bank employee, I can assure all readers that privacy of banking
records is non-existant. All you need is a friend who works in the computer,
auditing, bookkeeping, or loan department (in that order of preference). If
your friend has worked there long enough, he/she can probably also get
informmation from any other bank in the community. (Don't suggest the
security department. As far as bank transactions are involved, the Auditor
normally handles that.)
To reassure the excessively paranoid, bank employees are normally flooded
with so much information per day that they normally take no interest in any
more of it than their job forces them to. Moreover, when you consider that it
is commonplace for a teller to handle total transactions daily than run well
into six figures, few if any individual transaction attract any attention.
Banking trivia  Banks are the only businesses that close their books daily
rather than monthly or quarterly.
Banking trivia  When choosing a bank, check out the Cash Over/Cash Under
account on their balance sheets.

@_subject: FidoNet Remailer 
The Fido remailer appears to be drawing some interest. Fidonet is often
criticized (by me among many, many others) for being dull, provincial, and
dominated by power phreaks.
However, the Fidonet connectivity protocols have much to be admired from the
'punks perspective. Internet has great speed and bandwidth, but network
routing is "hardwired." Fidonet is frequently slow and narrowband, but
routing is much more flexible. The so-called "nodelist" contains the node
number (the equivalent of IP number), various technical parameters, and the
dial-up telephone number and availibility schedule at which e-mail/data calls
can be accepted.
Since the access number of every site in the network is known, you can send
e-mail directly to the destination site if you wish not to use standard,
fixed routing. This, plus call forwarding and laptops at pre-arranged
temporary locations, means Freeh's wiretap problem is now the need to monitor
every call at every ESS.  Hence, his curious request for huge wiretap

moral equivalent of the right wing militia groups.
A technical point: The piece would have the people who are not computer
literate believe that GIF and JPG are code words for porn pictures and are
used only in that context. The truth is they are merely computer filename
extensions used for two different graphical data formats. You will also find
GIF and JPG formatted images used on the Whitehouse WWW page, the Library of
Congress' THOMAS, and the WWW page for the Pope's visit to Baltimore - not to
mention the WWW page I just created for a customer selling polluted water
filtration systems.
I have never in my 62 years witnessed any news story on any subject about
which I had any personal knowledge or expertise that did not contain factual
errors. Is it any wonder that people are increasingly skeptical of the news
