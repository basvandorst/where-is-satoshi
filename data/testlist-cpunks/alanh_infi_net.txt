An excise is assessed against an event. For example, the constructive recipt of income. As in, when the employer disburses it to your constructive (*legal definition*) control.

I am correct that a peice of tinfoil doesn't comprise an actual screen.
Go price a shield room, and see how much is for materials, and how much is for labor.  Go talk to the crew that's putting it in; you'll see that they travel all the hell over the world putting these things in, because the vendor can't just hire some pick-up electricians and dry-wall types.
If the source radiates its EM waves, which reach and intercept the tinfoil, unless the tinfoil is correctly bonded, shielded, grounded, etc, the tinfile will re-radiate. That can be imaged.
I do this class of imaging, from signals that are weaker than these, for a
living. In fact, we sometimes have to apply attenuation at the front end
to stop overload of the amplifiers and signal processors.  No, I'm not going to talk about it. Not because I'm a hot-shit keeper of classified information, rather because I'm lazy, or maybe because I'm accustomed to getting paid for teaching? Most of the concepts are discussed in IEEE journals and other sources.  You could hand all the open sources, and a few billion dollars, to the Botswanians tomorrow; it would still take them a dozen years to get it working reliably. It's as much art as science. I guess the fancy word is "engineering".

How about the sender provides a Digicash e-cash payment for the
appropriate amount with each message, kind of like a electronic postage
stamp?  A script on the receiving side could automatically check the
payment amount, bouncing the message back to sender with an
"insufficient payment" message if necessary.  Or you could use a web
page to submit messages and payments.  Either way no one needs to worry
about billing, account tracking, etc.  Payment/billing is taken care of
immediately.  Of course, there is some overhead with the fees on e-cash,
but it probably would be more cost effective than other methods.
P.S. I have an alpha version of a program which may be of interest to

remote machine and then mails back the results.  The scripts (shell
scripts, perl scripts, or whatever) are encrypted and signed with PGP
before being sent to provide security and prevent unauthorized users
from executing scripts on your machine.  The program runs on unix

Submarine operations don't cost zero lives, either. In fact, just plain old regular military logistics - keeping the boys mobilized and in place ina theatre of operations - don't cost zero lives, even if there are _no_ And while all the starvation and devastation was going on in Japanese
cities, the Japanese troops were torturing and murdering Allied POWs, and
Asian civilains in all the Japanese-occupied teritories. Those people

I almost hate to start a thread about something that will inevitably implode into a middle-east-politics flamefest, but this reminds me of the time the newswires reported that 10% of Israel's population had attended that peace rally in Tel-Aviv. Was it right after the Sabra-Shatilla massacre?
Anyway, the followup news (which of course never made the news) was that it would not be physically possible for a third of that many people to all be in that place (Kikar Square?) all at once.  The original numbers were published by the Israeli "peace camp", who would have liked for there to be that many people there.
100,000 people at a funeral?  I don't doubt that there were 100,000 people who would have liked to be there, but I am skeptical that there's enough vehicles in Gaza to assemble 100,000 people  to a funeral within a few hours.
It doesn't matter does it?  Everyone is willing to lie when they write press releases; newspapers are willing to not check ridiculous claims (if the claim comports with the publisher's outlook); and setting the record straight doesn't help sell advertising, publishers really care how lazy journalists are.
I saw a great interview with the man who invented the phrase "ethnic cleansing" - a PR-agency guy in Boston under contract to the Bosnian Government. He openly stated, that he doesn't get paid to write the truth into press releases; he's paid to get his client's press releases into opinion-molder's fax machines FIRST. The first press release always wins. He also openly stated that he didn't know and didn't care if the Bosnian-Serb militias were operating concentration camps or not; the important thing was to fax the story to the American Jewish groups; he knew that the very *word* concentration camp would catch their eye and push them into agitating against the Serbs. He specifically stated, that he was so proud of his cleverness, because the Croatian President (foe of the Serbs) has a book under his belt ("Wastelands of Historical Reality") that is packed full of some very hot anti-Semetism.

My bullshit detector is starting to pin the needle.
US Customs doesn't care about your political status or leanings. They want to collect the proper excise and catch contraband.
There are INS people at passport control.   I am skeptical that they would detain a US passport holder for 36 hours. I would like to see some evidence that this actually happened.
US citizens can't be excluded from the country, nor have their citizenship taken away from them.

I didn't say I like the State. I said that there isn't, relatively speaking, much *political* content to the police-state that is the border.
Remember when those Sandanista sympathizers made the news, quite a number of years ago, for getting detained /FBI-interogated/harrassed when they crossed back into the USA?  It made the news because that sort of thing *is out of the ordinary* for the USA.
And, while I will certainly entertain the suggestion that their actions had a political underpinning, the Feds didn't lack for allegations of violation of United States Statutes to justify the harrasment.
If these  do-gooders had been doing something that comported with the sympathys of the (then) Administration, if they were in step with the Emperor's current "party line", then any such criminal violations would have been ignored. We all know that. So what?  Welcome to realpolitic.

cc: "Alan Horowitz  \"Timothy C. May\"" Very interesting. You make bona-fide sounding noises.
Now let me ask you this. Do you think that USA has, or will ever have, security organs as kick ass as the East Germans had?
Yet within a short time after the Soviets decided, to cede that whole part
of Europe, to the Bonn sphere of influence, those East German operatives were running to cover their ass.
Love of Liberty runs deep within the American psyche, analogously to the way that devotion to Islam runs deep in the Arab countries. The Islamists have plenty of sympathizers in various Arab security organs. Let's recall that President Sadat was shot by bona fide memmbers of the Egyptian military, in a highly organized operation.
If you were a CFR guy, would you bet your life that you could order 500
more Wacos, without having to fear that thre would be no loyalty problems
inside your chosen operating units? Let's accept that 20% of the SEALS said they'd confiscate legally-owned firearms from Americans....is 20% enough?    Of the other 80%, could you rely on _none_ of them to casue major, major problems?
The secret government has had total control of the economy, since the day the Federal Reserve was delegated the authority to create national debt.
America is already well-controlled for the benefit of Insiders. They really don't need to attain higher visibility or more power. They are anglo-saxons, not banana-republic cult-of-personality types. Does Walter Wriston have to worry about  Tim May deciding to stockpile blackpowder The SEALs are cannon fodder. They know it.

I *think* the only thing that's been affirmed, is that the feds can *tax*  weapons transfers.     I think the one particular case is called "Rock Island" or something like that. The defendant was *acquitted* of possessing an un-registered machine gun, because the authority to tax transfers of newly-manufactured machine guns, no longer exists. This is an over-simplifaction. Anyway, the point is, the defendant was acquitted right there in district court.
Tim, I don't think you'll be able to find anything in the Code of federal Regulations or the United States Statutes, which outlaws the manufacture or possession of a fission device in your basement.  I'm not even positive if it fits the legal definition of a "destructive device", whose *transfers*  are taxed.

The reporter's slander against Zimmerman was not accidental, or the result of ignorance.  Calling someone a Naxi sympathizer is not something that one should do without a smoking gun.
This act of aggression against cypherpunks, attempts to box us into a corner. Our enemies want to keep us on the defensive.  In that context, any and all energy we spend on "educating" and "correcting" is self-defeating. The hoplophobe lobby has shown, that enemies of freedom will not permit themselves to be "corrected". They will merely escalate the rate and size of their lies. Before slanders about "cop-killer bullets" could be corrected, they had moved onto "assault weapons".
We need to find a way to take back the initiative. We need to find a way to put the fear of God into liers. Violence won't work, since they are capable of human-wave attacks. I honestly don't know what reporters and editors fear the most. But, even a snake can be trained, if you can pinpoint the proper negative feedback.

The first was in a monograph which was putting forth the proposition that FDR  ardently desired to become involved in the war.  By the way, FDR was the man who made wage income, subject to federal taxation for the first I don't remember where I read the second.

Do you really think the FBI believes that asking librarians to keep records of customer useage is an efficient way to read the customers minds?
Do you really think that the FBI foreign counter-intelligence squad has nothing better to do than keep a database of who is reading Che Guevara    When someone is being obtained as an asset by an intelligence
organization, they are very very carefully led down a path of increasingly
serious crimes that they are directed to commit (in return for the sex or
the paying off of their debts, which are the two standard hooks) by the
controller ("foreign spy"). The first event is something quite minor. The
aim is, from the very beginning, to put the asset into a compromised
status, so that he believes he cannot turn to his own security people and
confess - with the chance that he'll agree to become a double-agent, so
that the DOD can put disinformation into Soviet hands, and the FBI can
build up a dossier of admissable evidence against the foreign controller. Remember, you can't get your own guys out of the Russian Gulag unless
you've got a GRU man to trade for. One of the early stages is, being directed to steal a technical book from a library and deliver it to the controller.
Now do you see the signifigance of the Library Awareness Program?
When I worked in the Route 128 area (suburban Boston), we were briefed to
be especially suspicious about folks who would befriend us in local bars
after work and, for no identifiable reason, start giving us little tiny
favors; over time they would become real "angels"  that saved our asses
when we were having financial/marriage problems. The day might come when
they would start asking for "a little favor in return".  Something quite
innocuous. Then there would arrive a request that we hesitated to do, but
we knew we could get away with it without a problem.  Then a few weeks

.....You should move out of the city to a place you can afford. There is no Constitutional right to live in Seattle.
This country has gone through many many many business cycles, financial panics, etc.  Only in the recent era have cities been forced to do these crackdowns (you think that herding and pacifying drunk/stoned panhandlers is pleasureable?  Try working as a Seattle cop for a week, oh Mr Armchair Sociologist) as a desperate measure of self-defense.
We are importing farm labor. There is plenty of work for those who want it. Ask the Vietnamese/Cambodian/Laotian refugees who've arrived in Seattle.
I am a strong libertarian. Sell crack cocaine, rent your pussy to horny middle-aged businessmen, do any non-violent, non-damaging-to-others-property you want, but damn well maintain public order and decorum. Or I will scream to my councilman for the cops to adjust your attitude with their billy club.

US SEcret Service was always on top of criminal counterfeiting. I make that "criminal" distinction becaue there is allegedly a phenomenon of  low-intensity-warfare going on, with Iran sponsoring more-or-less perfect counterfeits of hundred dollar bills.
Criminal counterfeiting was a dangerous game. Secret Service pretty much
knew every individuial/company who was involved in bona fide use of the
relevant papers, inks, engraving/printing equipments, etc., and anyone
ordering any of this stuff from the very limited number of suppliers, was
placed under watch. It's a small world out there, kids.

It appears that someone has figured out that medium-sized jurisdictions don't want to be left out of the trendiness. And has put together a product that can be peddled at the trade shows where Police Chiefs go.
I recall reading that there's something like 25,000 different police departments in America. It's a sizeable market. And a very politically correct one, right now.
Do these managers _need_ this stuff? Well, did they _need_ all those black-ninja hollywood flavored SWAT uniforms?
Now, if they could just get a few more PC-of-the-month phraseologies into the title of their product, they'd sell twice as many.  Start with "anti-deadbeat-dad software", maybe. "Pro Diversity". "Environmentally Friendly Software".

I think there is NOT a one-to-one mapping of Iranian to Aryan. specifically, Farsi'im might be descended from the Aryans, but so are some others. Northern Indians, I think?
I have another problem with your statement.  Islam was a gigantic watershed in the sociocultural history of Persia. Islamic currents are stronger in contemporary Iranian culture, than ancient Aryan influences.

There's no particular need for tax fraud, except by little guys. The big guys have lots of legal techniques. A prime example was the notorious $1000->$100,000 cattle futures transaction that Hillary Rodham Clinto did, just before entering the White House. Clearly, it wasn't an investment: it was a scheme to let some rich Arkansas guy pay a bribe - legally.  A cooperative broker sets up a "short" position and a "long" position on a trade - then the positions get assigned, after the market has made its move, such that the guy "loses" the $100k  and Hillary "has a profit".

THe IRS is very aggressive about making sure that employment taxes are
paid. If your boss has the right to tell you _how_ to do your work, he is
your boss, not your consulting client. It doesn't matter, whether your
boss choses to exercise his supervisory powers or not. If he has the
_right_ to do so - you are an employee. This has been wrung out in the
courts many times.

He who wants an Other Guy to certify him as a good guy is a supplicant. If the Other Guy wants you to get naked and stand on your hands in front of the Dutch Queen's front lawn, then that's their rule and you make your choice about obeying.
If the Other Guy wants your fingerprints so he can check whether you're escaped from prison for a mail fraud conviction, well: that's their rule.
If you want the Other Guy to certify your good character, then give your fingerprints. If you don't like it, then ply your trade without their peice of paper. You don't have a God-given right to have the peice of paper.
