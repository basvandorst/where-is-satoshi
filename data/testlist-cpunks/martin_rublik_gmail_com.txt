I'm sorry if I provided outdated information. Anyway I think that Microsoft
still uses CTLs in order to update the trust store. For the reference see for
example  or
CTLs can be downloaded using any browser on these URLs:
Unfortunatelly, the CTL does not contain entire certificate only its hash, but
using the link provided you can download the certificates.
If you have a Windows machine with certutil you can parse and download the CTL
with a simple powershell script:
certutil -dump .\authroot.stl | findstr "Identifier:" | ForEach-Object -Process {
-OutFile "$caCertSKI.crt"}
