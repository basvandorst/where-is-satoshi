The solution is obvious, to a chemist. Laminate the glass door with a
sheet of clear (impact or air sensitive) high explosive. Extra points
for using detonating HE, since turning glass into powder and not
littering up the sidewalk with glass shards.

Oracle Chief Executive Larry Ellison said Tuesday that he has donated
Oracle software to the U.S. government to create a database for national
After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Ellison has championed the need for
the United States to create a national standard for identification cards.
During his keynote speech at Oracle's OpenWorld customer conference in San
Francisco, Ellison said he has delivered Oracle's 9i database management
software to a U.S. government agency for national security, but he
declined to give further details, such as which agency or for what usage.
"We don't run those law enforcement agencies. We just provide them
software," he said during a news conference.
Ellison had earlier offered to donate its database software, but charge
for maintenance and upgrades as part of his goal of creating a national ID
Ellison has suggested airport security would be improved by requiring
travelers to provide their names and social security numbers to airport
security personnel. Security personnel could then compared the travelers'
thumbprints with those stored in a national security database to ensure
accurate identification.
When Oracle started up nearly 25 years ago, it built databases for the
Central Intelligence Agency. Database management software allows
businesses, Web sites and government agencies to store and manage vast
amounts of information. For example, Ellison said, the Immigration and
Naturalization Service has more than 80,000 handprints of travelers and
foreigners with visas to enter the country. He said national security data
is currently housed in multiple databases when it should be grouped
together in one central repository.
"There is cooperation (among government agencies)," he said. "But there's
a lot of data fragmentation."
During his news conference, Ellison added that a national standard for
identification cards is important for national security reasons. "Our
existing ID's should not be easily forged," he said. "Credit cards are
based on a set of standards, why doesn't the government?"

@_subject: FY;) [Pigdog] I've changed my mind, the 2nd amendment rocks (fwd) 
Reply-To: pigdog-l at bearfountain.com
So yesterday for my girlfriend's birthday 10 of us went to the Jackson
Arms Shooting Range (  ) in Millbrae to shoot
some guns.
I was a little scared about going, guns being EVIL and WRONG and very
Un-Berkeley (unless they're melted down into a statue provoting
nonviolence), but it was her 30th birthday, and she could do whatever the
hell she pleases.
We signed up for the novice package, which I must say is a pretty damn
good deal.  A retired cop gives you a 30 minute lecture on gun safety, how
guns work, how to grip them, how to aim them and all that good stuff.  He
used a Ruger MkII .22 pistol for the demonstration.  It was a little
disturbing, because I was sitting in the front of the class, and everytime
he needed to show one side of the gun or the other, he would point it up
and around in this big dramatic motion.  The intent was so that the gun
never faced anybody, but it was still a little scarey.
After the lecture and a little video that showed the semi-automatic pistol
reloading, we got to go to the range.  Everybody got a Ruger .22 and 100
bullets for target practice, but we were also allowed to upgrade our
pistols later.  We had the lane for two hours.
I was a tad bit scared when I picked up the gun, but not much as I would
have been if I hadn't had the course.  All my shots were consistently at 7
o'clock on the target (which was only 7 yards away).  I was sticking my
trigger finger too far into the trigger, so I was pulling it down and to
the left (I'm left handed).  The 3 women who were there were all DROP DEAD
ACCURATE though.  I mean right in the center of the target every single
So we started upgrading our guns.  I tried a 9mm (don't know what kind)
which I thought was as little jumpy and harsh, a Smith & Wesson revolver
(a .38 which is a .357 which is a .356 or some such nonsense) which was
FUCKING AWESOME, and a .44 which made really big wholes.  I have to say I
liked the revolver the most.  Once I shot the other weapons, I went back
to the .22 and was a hell of a lot more accurate.  The thing seemed like a
weak little toy gun.  It might as well be shooting suction darts.
They have a whole bunch of targets that you can choose from.... my
favorite was the hostage page. It had some unabomber looking guy with a
gun pointed at a woman.  I blasted the woman right between the eyes.
While we were there, a reporter from K101 who was doing a story on women
and guns interviewed us.  I guess she's a regular and when she learned a
woman was celebrating her 30th birthday by learning how to shoot, she had
to be there.  The woman kept asking Mary about safety and protection and
Mary said "oh, no, I just wanted to shoot stuff."  I guess we weren't what
she was looking for.  Mary will get a copy of the story in the mail, so
we'll see her take later.
Wow I really didn't think I'd enjoy shooting guns.  Now I need to join a
militia right away.
The teacher at one point did mention the 2nd amendment.  He said
"although the 2nd amendment guarantees us the right to bear arms, we do
not believe guns are for everybody."  So that was wholesome and
refreshing.   When the revolution comes I won't shoot him.  Actually I
think I'll stay away from him, after I saw what he could do rapidfire.
Also he would like the world to know that Danny Glover doesn't know how to
handle a firearm.
yikes! guns are cool!  What's a hippyuppymus to do?!?!

Hydrogen peroxide is not an organic peroxide. Concentrated hydrogen
peroxide is unstable, and can violently decompose, especially if catalysts
(finely distributed metals, pyrolysite) are present, but it does not
detonate. The usual use for it is for hypergolic rocket fuel (with
unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine).
Organic peroxides is something else entirely. You can make organic
peroxides using hydrogen peroxide, though it is not advisable for laymen.
In fact, due to their instability, it is better not to work with them at
all. Considerable potential for severe or even terminal injury there.

There are a billion: skin pigmentation as seen in NIR illumination (my, do
you look spotty), NIR laser scanning of body features (MEMS mirror
galvanometers), including millimeter wave which penetrates clothing (in
development still), voice fingerprint, person-specific word patterns
(Echelon is surely using these on targeted emails), gait and mannerisms
(not even in development, but sure to arrive some day).
The only way to avoid radiating a fingerprint is to use anonymized
teleoperated hardware as meatspace proxy. And of course you can outlaw
these, unless teleoperated robotics becomes very common in the next few
decades (possible, but I'm not counting on it).
Sure there are limitations to the current state of technology. The
biometrics are of lousy quality, take seconds to compute on a ~GHz CPU,
and are not generated in an embedded device.
Nevertheless, imaging technology makes good progress with embedding DSP
cores and using hybrid architectures based on silicon retina technologies
as pioneered by Mead.  Because this is machine vision used on moving
objects, it can tolerate dead pixels, allowing you to boost resolution
(Information in a 640x480 30 fps is sure limited, but with CMOS tech like
 and tolerance of ~5% dead pixels
multimegapixel sensors plus active optics for tracking and feature
extraction with parallel DSP cores integrated into the sensor you capture
a lot of info, and process it in situ, too). As soon as the devices become
sufficiently cheap you can integrate them into virtually anything
(installation costs typically dwarf hardware costs), including street
signs (OCR to read license plates is almost mature), lanterns, copers'
wearables, etc.
The extracted biometric alone is tiny, and can be readily transmitted
using even current paltry 9.6 kBps wireless modems.
With current tech the error rate is still high, but it's for real. The
hardware is going to become better due to Moore alone, including silicon
retina dedicated hardware, the economies of scale will apply, and of
course the software will get better, so the capabilities will be ramping
up very rapidly over the next few years.

You're saying it, "propaganda value". Missiles are only vulnerable during
boost phase, while they still have fuel onboard. Chemical lasers are
expensive, have limited operation time, are cranky, and laser tracking is
a nightmare. Mirroring the surface of the missile is a cheap
countermeasure, requiring orders of magnitude larger critical flux and
thus driving hardware costs at the other end.
You need serious energy flux and tracking precision to terminate a

My comment was limited to radiant energy weapons. As to those, the
critical vulnerability exists during launch and boost phase. The target is
slow, bright, large, has fuel on board and a nonarmored hull, which (as
other posters observed) can be weakened with enough flux.
The warhead in transit is fast, small, silent, and very, very hard to hit
critically (well, it is designed to withstand reentry and nuclear
antimissile near-hits), especially if it has a high-albedo coating, and if
it is accompanied by a cloud of decoys. Either radiant energy weapon or
kinetic kill, you're on the losing side here.
True, but irrelevant.
A missile in boost phase is not a satellite. A cloud of decoys is not a
satellite. An armored warhead is not a satellite.
The problem assymetry makes star wars a very expensive proposition. Using
airborne hardware instead of LEO is a good move, but it falls orders of
magnitude short of the target.
The demos are just that: demos. Given that a limited strike is best
conducted with remotely operated civilian aircraft, or plain old UPS, star

Okay, a have a chemical laser, something which burns tons of fuel
(deuterium/fluorine) in a second in a resonant cavity. It is hence a not
very small cavity. The wavelength is IR, several microns. This is
high-power optics with a giant aperture (because, you don't want your
optics to suffer the fate of your target, and because the resonant cavity
itself is huge).
Lenses don't like giant fluxes, either. Even a ruby laser pulse can break
optics, or the rod, if it has a blemish. Lenses are *HEAVY*. Lenses are
not flexible, so you can't use them for tracking. Lenses don't do very

UPS doesn't screen for fissible signatures. I very much doubt they screen

and contain a high nitrogen concentration, which you could probably detect
with proper activation spectrocopy, unless *very* well shielded, or packed
with a shipment of nitrate fertilizer). Screening devices are expensive,
and have a limited processvity -- but technology marches on, of course.

will get them into the country, and there's jack you can do about that.

File-trading pressure mounts on ISPs
By John Borland CNET News.com
Record companies have joined the movie industry in trying to root out
post-Napster file trading, putting new pressure on ISPs to clamp down on
subscribers' actions. ? ISPs say the last few weeks have seen a sharp
uptick in the number of requests they're getting to pull the plug on
subscribers who are using file-trading software such as Gnutella or iMesh.
Driven by a combination of high-profile summer movie releases and a growth
in the business of independent piracy hunters, these requests are putting
service providers in an awkward position. Even as they avoid facing
media-industry lawyers, these ISPs risk losing their customers to
competing Internet access companies that may be less aggressive about
curtailing the use of file-trading software. High-speed Internet provider
Adelphia, a cable company based in Pennsylvania, is one of the latest to
join the list of ISPs cracking down on file swapping in the post-Napster
world. Like many other ISPs, it has started suspending accounts of people
who have been identified by record companies or movie studios as file
swappers. "Over the past several weeks the Adelphia Internet Abuse
Investigation Team has seen a dramatic increase in the number of reports
of copyright infringement," Michael Healy, the company's senior Internet
abuse investigator, wrote in an e-mail to CNET News.com. "While Adelphia
values its relationship with our customers, we must also take appropriate
action when necessary to safeguard our interests in the global Internet
Adelphia, like other ISPs offering high-speed Net service, is increasingly
caught in a bind between protecting their customers and responding to the
growing demands of copyright holders. Privately, ISP executives say that
Napster and its rivals have been one of the biggest drivers of high-speed
Internet use, a part of their business that most big ISPs are desperately
trying to improve. But as decentralized swapping services like Gnutella,
Music City's Morpheus and Kazaa emerge, copyright holders are leaning on
ISPs to cut off file swapping at the source. Rise of the bounty hunters
ISPs have long received letters from record companies or movie studios
about pirated works on their networks. But until the rise of Napster and
similar services, the way to handle these was clearer. Under federal
copyright law, an ISP is not liable for any copyright content posted on
its network as long as it removes the content as soon as the owner points
it out. Traditionally, movies, songs and software have been posted on the
ISP's servers in the forms of pirate FTP sites or Web sites, and the ISP
could simply pull these down. In the file-swapping world, the law has
become murkier. People using Napster, Gnutella or the others keep all
content on their hard drives, and the only way to block their actions is
to turn off their connections. Some ISPs, such as Verizon Communications

File-trading pressure mounts on ISPs
By John Borland CNET News.com
Record companies have joined the movie industry in trying to root out
post-Napster file trading, putting new pressure on ISPs to clamp down on
subscribers' actions.   ISPs say the last few weeks have seen a sharp
uptick in the number of requests they're getting to pull the plug on
subscribers who are using file-trading software such as Gnutella or iMesh.
Driven by a combination of high-profile summer movie releases and a growth
in the business of independent piracy hunters, these requests are putting
service providers in an awkward position. Even as they avoid facing
media-industry lawyers, these ISPs risk losing their customers to
competing Internet access companies that may be less aggressive about
curtailing the use of file-trading software. High-speed Internet provider
Adelphia, a cable company based in Pennsylvania, is one of the latest to
join the list of ISPs cracking down on file swapping in the post-Napster
world. Like many other ISPs, it has started suspending accounts of people
who have been identified by record companies or movie studios as file
swappers. "Over the past several weeks the Adelphia Internet Abuse
Investigation Team has seen a dramatic increase in the number of reports
of copyright infringement," Michael Healy, the company's senior Internet
abuse investigator, wrote in an e-mail to CNET News.com. "While Adelphia
values its relationship with our customers, we must also take appropriate
action when necessary to safeguard our interests in the global Internet
Adelphia, like other ISPs offering high-speed Net service, is increasingly
caught in a bind between protecting their customers and responding to the
growing demands of copyright holders. Privately, ISP executives say that
Napster and its rivals have been one of the biggest drivers of high-speed
Internet use, a part of their business that most big ISPs are desperately
trying to improve. But as decentralized swapping services like Gnutella,
Music City's Morpheus and Kazaa emerge, copyright holders are leaning on
ISPs to cut off file swapping at the source. Rise of the bounty hunters
ISPs have long received letters from record companies or movie studios
about pirated works on their networks. But until the rise of Napster and
similar services, the way to handle these was clearer. Under federal
copyright law, an ISP is not liable for any copyright content posted on
its network as long as it removes the content as soon as the owner points
it out. Traditionally, movies, songs and software have been posted on the
ISP's servers in the forms of pirate FTP sites or Web sites, and the ISP
could simply pull these down. In the file-swapping world, the law has
become murkier. People using Napster, Gnutella or the others keep all
content on their hard drives, and the only way to block their actions is
to turn off their connections. Some ISPs, such as Verizon Communications
(NYSE:VZ - news), have refused to go this far, calling it a "drastic
remedy that infringes on people's rights and speech."
The Motion Picture Association of America has been one of the biggest
forces using these tactics. But individual studios are also boosting their
efforts with ISPs. Twentieth Century Fox, for example, recently sent a

Unless they look for nitrogen in bulk of the specimen (PGNAA), a very
expensive/low-processivity technique unsuitable for mass luggage screening
they're limited to stuff stuck to surfaces (lasers, swabbing/ion motility
spectrometer)  and volatile sniffers (chemical sensors, canines).
Many classes of explosives contain no nitrogen, many of those which
contain nitrogen and are free of volatile tracers don't emit much
volatiles, if properly packaged even very volatile explosives (say, methyl
or ethylnitrate) can be sealed (glass bottles). Generally, the maker and
the packager, unless they work very cleanly/are suited should not be the
courier, nor the outer containers be present in the contaminated area.
In short, detection probability is only high for sloppy/dumb people.
Salts are different from traces of uncombusted nitrocellulose deposited on
any surface of a nearby gun being fired.
Nitroglycerin is not volatile, is present in large dilution (~0.1%) in
small quanitities (pharma bottle). Ditto nitrate salts in a water
I think you should be able to get a good positive if you'd fire several
rounds of vanilla smokeless with baggage surface being near the muzzle
of the gun. Try it sometime, if you're unafraid of winding up in a
database. I've found that transporting computer parts (motherboard) in
hand luggage can suffice to trigger swabbing (if you're really bored you
can discuss detection of Semtex traces with airport security).
Just use an overall when you're at the range, and wash it separate.
If you want to fool the security, you should become familiar with the type
of detectors used on your luggage. Of course, best solution is using human
factors to not have your stuff being screened at all.

Biodiesel and bioethanol are horribly inefficient as far as conversion of
solar energy and agricultural area is concerned. Large scale agriculture
is not exactly environmentally neutral. They're extreme niche or gimmick
fuels at best.
Synfuel and synthetic methanol as well as hydrogen via fuel reforming from
fossils and biomass/renewables is another thing entirely, and entirely
worthwhile. Both synthetic methanol and fuel reforming allows slow
migration to fuel cells, without pissing off the fossil fuel people.

@_subject: OFF TOPIC: Re: America needs therapy 
This is about as off-topic as the mold issue. You've been warned.
No. I'm saying if you use bioethanol, biodiesel or oil made from
agricultural products you're milking a negligable fraction of the solar
constant (1.4 kW/m^2 flux hereabouts), even solar constant at the bottom
of this gravity well (varies greatly). Plus, you kill soil, reduce
biodiversity, contaminate ground water, reduce ground water level plus
cause salination in susceptible areas, burn energy for machines,
fertilizer & Co and create waste. There are also less tangible but
nevertheless real factors such as high material fluxes, associated
pollution, perpetuation of Carnot cycle machines and agromafia.
What we need is sufficient control of molecular self-replication that we
can use photons directly for photosynthesis or water photolysis. Before
we'll get that, we'll have to settle for conventional thin-film and
polymer photovoltaics, electrolysis and photoelectrolysis/photosynthesis.
I would think that CuInSe thin film would do very nicely today if
facade-integrated, before we get polymer.
Energy density of ethanol is about half of gasoline. You *can* use it in a
fuel cell or a fuel reformer, but methanol is easier. Methanol <->
synthesis gas conversion is really clean.
So, assuming these people haven't been pulling data straight from their
ass, you have to burn half of the ethanol you would get from a square
meter of a field in order to do it. Not counting the presence of said
field, the agricultural infrastructure and the agrohol plant.
Now this says something else than journeyforever folks said. 8:1 is
something else than 2:1.
Energy efficient as compared to what exactly? Nuke, fossil, photovoltaics,
wind? And, of course, energy is only a very small part of the picture.
Now, it's only 125%. Very strange numbers, these.
I do not refer to the study of Pimenthal, just seat of the pants ecology
and 8th class highschool level physics. I don't have time to google for
this stuff, but I'm sure you'll find enough references as to why
bioethanol and biodiesel are hardly a silver bullet.

GEO is lousy: it's too far away, and it's packed already. Newer concepts
assume LEO with active microwave focus tracking of the rectenna ground

to have sufficient amounts of hardware in the sky for continuous line of
sight presence.
Luna is closest, and it's near enough for relativistic lag being low
enough to allow teleoperation. Sending monkeys elsewhere would seem a
later stage.
Problem is high LEO launch costs. It would seem easier to build automated
and teleoperate fabbing and (linear motor) launching facilities on Luna,
and circularize orbit mostly by aerobraking.

"For God's sake, Ali-Hamoud," Alsheri moans. "I wasn't talking about

"The bischt isn't only for formal occasions anymore," I shoot back. "Sure,
the older, thicker bischts, the ones made of heavy wool or cotton material,
are used exclusively for ceremonial occasions. But the lighter version, the

double-parked out there?"
He peers under the table canopy toward the street, seeming crestfallen all
of the sudden. A pair of ripped jogger-faggots wearing sweat-drenched
Florida State t-shirts trots by. "No," he whispers, shaking his head sadly.
"No, that's not mine. I don't have a Taurus."
The three of us, Abdulaziz Alomari, Waleed Alsheri, and I are sitting at
Easy Earl's beachside cafe in Opa-Locka, and it's a little after four.
Alsheri is wearing a beige ankle-length dishdara with flared bushti and red
micro-piping, a matching gahfiyya and gold-encrusted agal made of
tightly-wrapped spider silk, all by Fahad, and black Mecca sandals with
camelskin toe-straps that I mistakenly think at first are Nila Rafiq but
which are actually, Alsheri tells me later, handmade. Alomari is wearing an
understated sleeveless Elham Abbas kandura, a red-and-white patterned El
Mouf ghtira, and a pair of tan Armani poplin shorts to help fight of the hot
Florida weather (we're allowed to wear shorts with a kandura). Our table is
on a raised oak deck overlooking the ocean. I'm wearing a Joseph Abboud
solid red silk dishdara that comes with a matching exercise bag and, like
Alomari, a red-and-white patterned ghtira-gahfiyya arrangement, although
mine is Elham Abbas and much more expensive. Alomari and Alsheri finished
their flight classes early for facials somewhere and their tans look good.
The O'Reilly Report today was about the expansion of NATO to include the
Baltic states.
"Guys, guys," I say. "Who's sitting with Karim Koubriti over there? Is that
Ahmed Hannan?"
"Negative," Alsheri grunts. "That's Nabil Al-Marabh. You can tell by the
crop-duster glasses."
There's a short but uncomfortable silence at the table. "No," says Alomari
quietly. "That's not Al-Marabh."
"Are you sure?" I ask.
He nods, and you can see it all of the sudden: he's never been more sure of
anything in his life. "It's not Al-Marabh," he says. "It's... Atta."
The infidel hardbody waitress, definitely an FSU cheerleader type (or maybe
Georgia Tech), blond, huge tits, snake-pattern tattoo encircling the left
bicep, sleeveless cutoff T-shirt, denim jeans, friendly face, comes over to
ask if we want a new drink. We've been coming here every day for four weeks
and she's always asking us questions, trying to make conversation and get to
know us. "Where y'all fellas from?" she asked Koumbari and me yesterday.
"Howdaya like Opa-Locka?" "Opa-what?" I answered. "Opa-Locka," she said.
"Our town." "I know it's the fucking town," I growled, and after that she
didn't ask us any more questions. Now she's trying to smile but is
definitely keeping her distance as she steps around Alsheri's dishdara to
pick up his plate.
"They make them healthy here, that's for sure," Alsheri says, leering, as
she walks away.
"Just once, God," Alomari says, mock-bowing toward Mecca. "Just once. After
that, you can do what you want with me."
"Yeah," snorts Alsheri. "He can do what he wants with you. Just wait."
I'm not sure how Alomari knows Atta so well-maybe through the Germans?-and
it slightly pisses me off but I decide to even up the score a little bit by
showing everyone my new box cutter. I pull it out of my exercise bag
(Ahmed's, $39) and slap it on the table, waiting for reactions.
"What's that, a lighter?" Alsheri asks, not apathetically.
"New box cutter," I say, trying to act casual about it, but I'm smiling
proudly. "Opinions?"
"Whoa," Alomari says, lifting it up, snapping the blade in and out of its
stainless steel sheath, turning it until it glints in the sunlight. "That is
nice, Ali-Hamoud. Take a look." He hands it to Alsheri.
"Picked it up at Staples yesterday," I say. "Jiffi Safe Cutter, 2 and 3/4",
Left hand model, custom-shined. Ninety-seven dollars for a pack of six."
"Good coloring," Alsheri says, studying it closely.
"That's Siberian steel," I point out. "Something called Omsk Blue."
"Omsk blue?" Alsheri asks.
"Really stands out, doesn't it?"
"Yeah," Alsheri says guardedly, the jealous bastard, "it is cool,
Ali-Hamoud. I'm sure the fucking metal detectors will like it, too."
Alomari doubles over. "Oh, shit," he says, wheezing with laughter. "Oh,
Alsheri just sits there, grinning smugly, pulls something out of his bag and
slaps it down on the table, next to the napkin dispenser. "What you really
need," he says, "is something like this." He turns to me. "What do you
"Nice," I croak, but under the table my hand is involuntarily gathering into
a fist.
"Good God," Alomari says, picking it up. "Is that a three-color plastic
"Four," Alsheri says.
I snatch it away from Alomari, who's smaller than me and, I think, worried
that I might secretly be on the liquidation team. He relinquishes it
instantly. "Where's the fourth?" I say, not looking up. "I only see three."
"Modern Specialties, Inc.," Alsheri says. "Kutto Master Carton Cutter. Model
 Right-hander. The shell is three-color plastic, but get this: the blade
is plastic, too. Well, the outside of it, anyway."
"An alloy?" Alomari says, admiringly.
Alsheri shakes his head. "Not only," he said. "The body is a plastic alloy.
But there's a hardened polymer coating. Totally undetectable."
Even I have to admit it's magnificent.
Suddenly the cafe seems far away, the wind dies, even the sound of the waves
diminishes, everything a meaningless hum, next to this box-cutter, as I hear
Alomari reading the sans serif inscription on the shell: "Al-Qaida, Laden,
"Holy shit," Alomari says. "I've never seen anything like-"
Atta stops by our table on his way out. He's wearing sunglasses by Persol
and he's carrying a briefcase by Coach Leatherware.
"Allah Akhbar," he says. "What have we got here, box cutters?" He lowers his
sunglasses just to make sure, picking up Alsheri's, not even looking at
mine. "Modern Specialties, Inc. I recognize it. The Kutto Master. Not
bad-but look at this."
He opens up his briefcase and takes out a large plastic shopping bag and
turns it upside down, emptying the contents-a good two dozen completely
translucent box cutters-onto the table. One spills off the edge, bounces off
the deck, and lands in the sand. A fat infidel who's been sitting at the
next table with his fat infidel wife and their two children with
jelly-stained faces reaches down to pick it up, just being friendly. Atta
slaps at his arm.
"Hands off, devil," he hisses.
"I'm just trying to help-" the infidel begins.
"Help yourself first," Atta snaps. "Lose some goddamn weight."
"And stay away from New York," Alsheri says.
"Shut up, you fool," Atta snaps.
The infidel crawls back to his seat. Catching his breath-he was shaken by
this totally unnecessary interruption-Atta picks up one of the cutters on
the table, flicks open the blade, and holds it, demonstratively, to
Alomari's throat.
"Griptite, USA-made, three-inch, Right-hand models all," he says. "These are
custom-built diamond box cutters. Razor sharp, saws through iron.
Individually, they cost $960 apiece, but I got a volume discount-96 for
$80,000. And the guy who made them is already dead."
"Is this the Cedar Rapids factory?" asks Alomari, the ass-kisser.
Atta turns to him and frowns contemptuously, which pleases me. "Cedar
Rapids? Griptite's Cedar Rapids location is closed. These are from Butte."
"Opened three months ago," sighs a defeated Alsheri.
Atta turns to me. "What do you think, Ali-Hamoud?"
"Nice," I say. "Very nice."
Flight School
I'm on the verge of tears by the time we reach SimCenter because I'm
positive we won't get any time on the simulator, but there's practically no
line when we get there, and relief that is almost revelatory in scope washes
over me in an awesome spiritual wave. The instructor is a serious infidel
hardbody, not quite blond, huge tits, good ass, blue instructor's suit by
Karl Lagerfeld, silk gazar blouse, gold sling-back pumps. I'm positive
Alsheri has fucked her. It's near impossible to get screen time at SimCenter
on short notice and I think the rest of us-besides Waleed, I'm with Alomari
and Ahmed Hannan-are a little jealous of Alsheri's prowess in securing
reservations. When we piled into the 1989 Pontiac Grand Prix in Palm Beach
we realized we had no simulator time booked and while we debated the merits
of a new program at Huffman aviation-my panic so great I nearly slit my
wrists with one of Atta's diamond boxcutters-a consensus seemed to emerge.
Alsheri had the only dissenting voice but he finally shrugged and said, "I
don't give a shit," and dialed up SimCenter on a secure satellite phone as
we rolled out onto the highway.
"Okay, pop TQ quiz," Hannan says. "On what days can you trim your beard in
"You can never trim your beard in Kabul," I say, annoyed.
"You can do it in private," Alomari says haughtily. "When no one is looking.
If you do it less than once every two months, no one notices."
"Oh, really?" I say. "And where do you plan on doing it, Alomari? In the
bathroom? Where your wife might come in? Not fucking likely."
"Come on, Ali-Hamoud," Hannan says, flicking on his left turn blinker and
glancing over his shoulder. "You've got to remember you're dealing with true
Islam in Kabul. No wife would dare raise her hand to point a finger at a
husband, for God's sake. They'd fucking put her to death just for that. And
you can go back to trimming your beard. There's another one of those new
Volkswagen bugs."
"The old ones were better," Alsheri says absently. "They were cheaper." He's
been in a bad mood about something since before the call to SimCenter.
"Hannan," I say sharply. "Whether or not you can get away with trimming your
beard in front of your wife... that's not the point. A Muslim's job is to
provide an example for his family. And besides..."
"Here we go again..." Hannan groans. "You're a goddamn cleric, you know
that, Ali-Hamoud?"
"And besides," I continue, "you're forgetting the main problem, which is
that the main issue with trimming your beard is that fucking God sees it. It
is written: 'Conduct yourself with justice and bear true witness before God,
even though it be against yourselves, your parents, your... your..."
"Your what, Ali-Hamoud?" Hannan snaps. "Your what?"
"Your hairy ass?" Alsheri says, brightening suddenly.
"Ali-Hamoud's ass isn't hairy," Alomari says. "I've seen it. He bent over to
pick up a penny last week and his kandera fell down. Caused some infidel
faggot to wreck his car on Dale Mabry highway."
Alsheri gives him a high five. Even Hannan laughs.
"Your kinsfolk," I interrupt. "Even though it be against your kinsfolk.
What's wrong with you people? Aren't you even Muslims?"
"Ali-Hamoud, you are some kind of morose bastard," Hannan says. "You should
cut down on the goddamn nectar."
When we get to the waiting room at SimCenter Alsheri and Hannan disappear
suddenly and I know right away what's going on. Five minutes later Alsheri
returns more pissed off than ever. "This place sucks," he says. "You can't
even get your prayer mat down in the bathroom stalls."
"Why don't you go outside like everyone else?" I say, pointing at a
bucktoothed infidel in a tie, short-sleeved white Arrow shirt and baseball
hat who is sitting across the room. "Ricky here isn't afraid to pray in the
parking lot. Are you, Ricky?"
"It's Billy," the infidel says meekly.
Alsheri scrunches his nose in disgust, as though smelling rotted cheese.
"Who cares what your fucking name is?" he shouts. "There's ESPN in the other
room if you don't like it. Infidel."
"I... I do pray in the parking lot," Billy says. He looks too old for
college but too dumb for adulthood.
"You see, Waleed?" I say. "He does pray in the parking lot."
"Bullshit," Alsheri says. "No one prays in a parking lot. Not even an
"Why shouldn't he?" I say. "He's accepted Jesus Christ as his personal
savior. Haven't you, Billy?"
"I have," Billy says. "Yes, sir, I found the Lord. He helped me through a
trane-sishunul peer-yud."
"Yeah?" Alsheri snorts. "What 'tranesishunl peer-yud was that?"
"Ah was incarcerated," Billy says. "I had sinned against the Lord. Which is
the same as sinning against myself."
This kid is a real winner.
"What were you in for, Billy?" I say, in a comforting voice.
The infidel leans forward and swallows so hard his tie leaps forward. "I had
exposed myself to a person of under-a person of younger-to a minor."
"Well, that's brave of you to admit that, Billy," I say. "Now do you mind
telling us: what the fuck are you doing in Boeing flight school?"
"Is that what this is?" he says. "I had no idea. I'm just here for a
janitor's job. They told me this was an airport."
"It's an airport," Hannan groans, "and a flight school. Mother of God." He
slaps his forehead.
"How do these people feed themselves?" Alomari whispers to me.
"They put them out in fields," I say sagely, "to graze."
"Okay," Alsheri says, getting up and walking toward the door, his
gold-embossed Fahad sandals clacking against the tile. "That's it. I'm
leaving. There has to be some place in this fucking town to pray. You idiots
can do what you like."
"Good riddance," Hannan says. "Now there's less competition for the
"She's too old to fuck anyway," Alsheri says, walking out the door.
A Glimpse of a Tuesday Morning
And it's early morning and I find myself standing in line at the check-in at
Logan airport behind three infidels in suits, they don't know what's coming,
and I'm sweaty and a pounding migraine thumps dully in my head and I'm
experiencing a major-league anxiety attack, searching my pockets for Valium,
Xanax, an apricot pit, and all I find are three sesame seeds in a Fari
Narwaq pillbox, so I pop all three in my mouth and swallow it with a
chocolate Yoo-Hoo and I couldn't tell you where it came from if my life
depended on it. I've forgotten who I'm on this run with and, more
importantly, where I'm supposed to be sitting. Is it next to Atta, who's
standing far ahead of me in line and glaring at me (even though he's not
actually looking at me or turning around at all, I can tell, just by looking
at the back of his head, that he's glaring at me all the same), trying to
convince me to calm down? Or is it next to Alsheri? Is Alsheri even on this
flight? There's someone about 10 feet behind me who looks like Alsheri, but
couldn't that also be Al Shehhi? Not that I haven't spent a lot of time with
Alsheri, I have, I've seen him almost every day, he's the only interesting
person I know, but I still can't even distinguish this person, objectively
important in my life, from a stranger. Did I have the yogurt kebabs last
night for dinner, or was it moussaka? "Oh, God in heaven, I can't remember."
But soon we're on the plane and everything is clear: Atta is bounding into
the cockpit, diamond boxcutter in hand, and Alsheri/Al-Shehhi is pouncing on
the two hardbody infidel stewardesses in the front of the cabin, and
suddenlly the plane lurches sharply downward and to the left, screams
everywhere, total pandemonium, but then magically my composure is regained,
this is all automatic now, I've been through this a thousand times before,
and mechanically I stagger forward toward the cockpit as the plane rights
itself and quickly I assume the seat of the (already deceased) navigator and
shut off the radar tracking devices before shouting into the radio, "I am a
personal acquaintance of Assad's second cousin. Do you hear me? I know him
personally." The infidel voice on the other end of the line, confused: "UA
11, repeat transmission, over, didn't catch that, over." "My kandera never
fell off in Tampa. I never picked up that penny!" "Shut the fuck up, you
moron!" Atta is screaming, I can only see the back of his head, his ears are
highlighted against the sun shining in from the cockpit window, clouds are
rushing past us, and I look down and I'm holding the microphone in my hand
weakly, like it's something limp and soggy, but I'm still whispering to
somebody "ghirta ghirta ghirta" then the clouds parted and the skyline

FYI, the W3C has issued a last call for comments on several
proposals related to XML encryption.  More info at:
  Since I know a good number of folks on this list are interested
in encryption and Internet communication, I thought I would pass
it along as it involves encrypting XML, much of which will no
doubt be passed across the Internet.
The specific documents are at:
  XML Encryption Requirements
          This document lists the design principles, scope, and requirements
     for the XML Encryption. It includes requirements as they relate to
     the encryption syntax, data model, format, cryptographic processing,
     and external requirements and coordination.
  XML Encryption Syntax and Processing
          This document specifies a process for encrypting data and
     representing the result in XML. The data may be arbitrary data
     (including an XML document), an XML element, or XML element
     content. The result of encrypting data is an XML Encryption element
     which contains or references the cipher data.
  Decryption Transform for XML Signature
          This document specifies the "decryption transform", which enables
     XML Signatures verification even if both signature and encryption
     operations are performed on an XML document.

However, if you block at IP level after pulling more than 100

picking a spider off the shelf, or heavily customize one to throttle it.
So, consider burning a few CDs (the site is currently what? 200 MBytes,

reduce the load on your site, too.

---------- Forwarded message ----------
It's clear that the US administration is putting out feelers to
again ban publication of strong encryption.  See:
  The evil gnomes who keep advancing unconstitutional US anti-crypto
policies know that the current hysteria in Congress and the
Administration will not last forever.  So they will probably move very
quickly -- within a week is my guess -- to re-control encryption,
either by a unilateral action of the Administration (by amending
the Export Administration Regulations), or by stuffing a rider onto
some so-called "emergency" bill in Congress.
They maneuvered very carefully in the Bernstein case such that there
is no outstanding injunction against violating the Constitution this
way -- and even no binding 9th-Circuit precedent that tells them it's
unconstitutional to do so.  They know in their hearts that numerous
judges have found it unconstitutional, but they have proven throughout
the seven-year history of the case that they don't give a damn about
the Constitution.  Which means it may take weeks, months or years for
civil liberties workers to get a judge to roll back any such action.
Not just days.  We won the case, but they squirmed out of any
permanent restrictions -- so far.
The US government has a new mania for wiretapping everyone in case
they might be a terrorist.  There's already two bills in Congress to
make it trivial for them to wiretap anybody on flimsy excuses, and to
retroactively justify their precipitous act of rolling Carnivore boxes
into major ISPs this week and demanding, without legal authority, that
they be put at the heart of the networks.  See:
  Even more than before, we will need good encryption tools, merely to
maintain privacy for law-abiding citizens, political activists, and
human rights workers.  (In the current hysteria, mere messages
advocating peace or Constitutional rights might best be encrypted.)
The European Parliament also recently recommended that European
communications be routinely encrypted to protect them from pervasive
US Echelon wiretaps.
Some US developers, who thought such a reversal would never happen,
have built or maintained a number of good open source encryption tools
in the United States, and may not have lined up solid foreign
maintainers or home sites.
LET'S FIX THAT!  We need volunteers in many countries to mirror
current distributions, CVS trees, etc.  We need volunteers to also
act as maintainers, accepting patches and integrating them into
solid releases.
(Note that too many countries have pledged to stand toe-to-toe with the
US while they march off to make war on somebody they can't figure out
who it is yet.  If you live in one of those countries, you may
suddenly find that your own crypto regs have been sneakily altered.
Take care that each useful package has maintainers and distribution
points in diverse countries.)
I haven't kept close track of which packages are in danger.  I
suggest that people nominate packages on this mailing list, and that
others immediately grab mirror copies of them as they are nominated.
And that some of those who mirror them keep quiet, in case hysterical
governments make a concerted effort to stamp out all copies and/or all
major distribution sites.  If you aren't the quiet type, then *AFTER*
IMMEDIATELY PULLING A COPY OF THE CODE OUTSIDE US JURISDICTION,
announce your mirror on this mailing list.
We freedom-loving US citizens have had to rely on the freedom-loving
citizens of saner countries, to do the work of making strong
encryption, for many years.  We had a brief respite, which we will
eventually resume for good.  In the meantime, please let me apologize
for my countrymen and for my government, for asking you to shoulder
most of the burden again.  Thank you so much.
PS: Companies with proprietary encryption packages might consider
immediately open-sourcing and exporting their encryption add-ins, so
their customers can still get them from overseas archives.  Or taking
other actions to safeguard the privacy and integrity of their
customers' data and their society's infrastructure.  I also advise
that they lobby like hell to keep privacy and integrity legal in the US.

MMReencrypt is an add-on for Mailman. It allows reencrypting mailing lists
for added security. Users post messages PGP- or GPG-encrypted to the
list's public key. MMReencrypt decrypts them, then re-encrypts the message
to each subscriber.

Indeed. Physical properties of some common nerve agents:
Specifically VX:
Boiling point (0C, 760 mm Hg)  298.4 (calculated), with decomposition
Vapor pressure (mm Hg)  0.0007 at 200
Volatility (mg/m3)  10.5 at 250C (1/2000 as volatile as sarin)

Spare your breath. The only way to shut up someone with a mental condition
is to kick him off the list, to leave the list, or use filtering. They're
entirely closed to rational argumentation.
People who have something to say are usually not that patient, and just
leave the list. Overpermissiveness results in quality loss.

While in pine, hit the keys m s r f a
Use e.g. mattd  as From pattern
Set up a folder e.g. called junk in Filter action.
Of course, procmail is better, but you have to be careful when setting it
up, since it is easy to lose mail, if you don't know what you're doing.

HMDT is another "alternative". Really fun to work with:

      Well, I put a small piece of HMTD into a brick, and hitted it with a
    hammer, and it didn't detonate. I also tried a 'spark-test' from a
    lighter, and didn't managed to detonate HMTD. ( Indeed in ntp, and in
    normal condition, HMTD wont detonate If you light it, It'll burn like
    cellulose nitrate - with a yellow flame. Well, I was more than
    Happy to see, That I'd found A PERFECT Primary-explosive to detonate
    high-explosives.
      Well At the July of 1989 It happened, I was damping HMTD into a .22
    LR copper cartridge, with a standart match, you see holding that
    cartridge in my left hand ,when it suddendly detonated, A HUGE explosion,
    and I found that for some reason, my hand was bleeding abt 1/2 liter
    of blood per min ( 1/9 gallon per min ) , and I could see my bone
    'shining' through scraped human tissue.
       Epiloque. Never NEVER load B-caps in your hand, Always use special
    tamping device when loading Blasting caps - any other use for HMTD is
    silly - Believe me, I had hitted HMTD with a Hammer, It didn't
    detonate, and now, when I try to load that stuff from same batch into
    a copper container, It detonates, even I press with maybe 1/2 kg
    ( = 1 pound ) force it.
       Maybe the batch was impure, but believe me, It really explode
    without no reason. I must say that HMTD is a good explosive, but It's
    truly unpredictable. I'm sure that there are many others in this
    newsgroup who can tell the same thing - months of hard handling, and
    then, a explosion by a minumum force.
They're made (or used to be made until very recently) from celluloid,
nitrocellulose of low degree of nitration plasticized with camphor. It is
soluble in acetone, but diethylether/ethanol is a better solvent. I don't
see this being anything else than binder, stabilizer or desensibilizer for
the organic peroxides/PETN.
A simple Google search should pull up dozens of links on how to make it.
Don't. If you don't know how to make it, it means you can't handle it
safely. Quantities of organic peroxides in novice's hands will quickly
make them missing digits, or Worse. Organic peroxides are much too
instable to be safely worked with, period.
