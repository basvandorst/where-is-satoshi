-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hello Everyone!
remailer and I'm ready for it to go online publically. Just like the
Middleman type-II (mixmaster) remailer, the type-I Middleman randomly
selects a remailer path to send messages based on Raph Levien's
remailer list. Additionally, to foil traffic analysis, the Middleman
type-I remailer also supports message reordering. This means that
middleman at jpunix.com is now a fully functional type-I/type-II remailer
that uses the middleman random remailer feature in additon to
reordering. All of the available functionlity that you would find in
either a Mixmaster remailer as well as a Cypherpunks remailer is
available in the middleman at jpunix.com remailer. Below is the public
PGP key for middleman at jpunix.com.

@_subject: MiddleMan comes out of the closet! 
Hello Everyone!
       After a lot of testing, I've come to discover that the middleman
reliability problems are vastly due to the nymserver front-end. With this
in mind, I've decided to drop the nym for middleman and announce it's
actual presence.
       I am middleman and I wrote the patches to mixmaster to make it work
with premail. I want to see the middleman remailer work as a viable
remailer and I feel that having the nym front-end has caused a less than
acceptable remailer in terms of usability.
       With this, I'm announcing the new email address for the middleman
remailer. It is now middleman at jpunix.com. What does this affect? The
middleman remailer can be used as a front-end remailer and you don't have
to question who is running it. The middleman remailer will still NEVER be
the remailer on the end, hence the problems with discovery and persecution
by entities that wish to go after "the remailer on the end" hopefully will
not occur. Of course anyone wishing to run a middleman remailer can still
opt to use a nym, but at the price of a decrease in performance.        I will continue to work with Matt Ghio to get the nymserver code to
be more reliable. I admit, it needs a facelift.
       If you have any questions or comments please feel free to email me
at perry at alpha.jpunix.com. Flames go to /dev/null.

Hello Everyone,
jpunix.com. The most notable change is that the q at c2.org has been removed
from the list. After several spot checks over the weekend I noticed the
ncognito remailer producing sporadic pings so I left it on the list. Also,
please note that the middleman remailer has changed nym servers from
alpha.c2.org to nym.jpunix.com. by anonymous FTP at ftp.jpunix.com.

Hello Everyone,
sorry the shinobi remailer announced it's retirement but the exciting
thing seems to be this mysterious "middle-man" remailer. If it works as
the maintainer says, we can have a whole new avenue for setting up
undetectable remailers. Anyway, I've updated the type2.list/pubring.mix
combination on jpunix.com to reflect the retirement of shinobi and the
creation of the middle-man remailer. The lists are available by anon FTP

could do, but that would also defeat the anomitity by the nature of
notifying the site that you wish to use them. This does not apply to
chaining remailers as by running a remailer, the operator of the remailer
is tacitly giving permission to be used in the chain in most cases.

Actually a simple form of encryption is available. There is a plug-in to
eggdrop called wire. I have used it in my eggdrop bot on  and it
has worked well. Basically you log into the bot with a /dcc chat and then
execute .wire  where  is a mutually agreed upon key. Then to
send encrypted chats to others that have connected with the same key, each
line that you type needs to be preceded with a ";". I'll fire it up if you
want to look at it. Go to any EFnet server, check in and then go to
channel  Say hello to rops and then check in. I believe it uses
the crypt(3) function for encryption.
