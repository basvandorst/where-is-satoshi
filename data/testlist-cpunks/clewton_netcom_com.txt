The last time I read anything on the subject, conspiracy exists when
any co-conspirator makes any action included in the planned event.
If no one makes the first move, no felony.  Make any action to complete
a step of the crime and you automatically become conspirators.
Even if the plan is to commit a misdemeanor, the conspiracy is a felony, and one frowned upon by LE types.
Well, back to lurking.  It isn't often I have much to add to the group.
I do enjoy the exercise sifting through the distilled thoughts of a bright

If you substitute the word "gun" for "crypto" most all of this applies to
your second amendment rights as well.
The plan seems to be to demonize and then ridicule the target group until the masses are convinced they are not worthy of rights.  The best known case:  Germany in the 30s and 40s.  The new Jew=crypto user.
Mike is exactly right when he states that every story in print or video or
radio highlights the miniscule misuse of crypto and, of course, the
Oprah generation eats it up.  Now, they do not give the relative misuse of
crypto, it must be huge or why would they report it as a problem, right?
About like the horrendous number of crimes committed with so-called
assault weapons, which on a bad day might approach 1%.
Let us not forget RICO while we're at it, talking about seizing.

Perfectly put, Perry.  I have my store-bought copy of Netscape all
neatly wrapped and ready to send back to them, pending only their
timely response.
If I do not hear them denounce GAK, then away it goes.

During the program, which was *very* interesting, it was announced by
CSPAN that they would carry the remainder of the meeting next Sunday
Sept. 17.  Check w/them for the time locally.

Not quite squashed, Duncan.  Bullet placement (poor by some standards)
is all that prevented Mr. Weaver from croaking like his unfortunate wife.
She is said to have "pissed off" the feds but was not charged with a
single actionable item yet she remains quite dead.
Unless I have missed somthing somewhere, no TLA is concerned in the slightest
with individual liberty.  That notion should keep a rational person awake
