@_subject: biological systems and cryptography 
How do you all see the future use of biologically based systems
affecting cryptography in general?
By biologically based systems I mean machine learning, genetic
algorithms, chips that learn (like Carver Mead's work), neural
networks, vecor support machines, associative memory, etc.
It seems to me that computer science based on writing longer and
longer streams of instructions is coming to an end, as it cannot
possibly scale. We now have supercomputers that can execute 35
trillion instructions per second, but if someone has to write all of
those instuctions, what good are they?  Also, it seems that the brain
has immensely powerful visual processing power, without having
millions of lines of code written to do so.
I only ask this because I'm deciding whether to study computational
neuroscience or cryptography in grad school.

And what list would that be? I'd like to take a look at it.
Last summer I read "the physics of consciousness". It was a pretty
disappointing attempt to explain consciousness with QM, mixed with
lots of emotional and relgious hand waving, nice background info
Anyway, this is exactly why I want to do computational neuroscience. I
also think that the turing machine is a sorely classical model, and
that the brain is definitely not a turning machine, but something
else, far more powerful.
As for making a neuron, look into the research of henry abarbanel. I
was in his lab the other day, and his students have actually made
simple neurons that can be wired into the brain of a lobster to
simulate removed neurons, creating the proper oscillation to generate
the signals which allow the lobster to digest things. He mostly does
research into the nonlines dynamic properties of neurons. I'm hoping
to work in his lab next year.

People do break cyphers, by finding weaknesses in them. Are you saying
that you think that current cyphers are unbreakable?
Also, what about using biological systems to create strong cyphers,
not to break them?
It seems that all of these analyses assume that an instruction is a
single mathematical operation in a turing machine. What if each
operation was something else? I refuse to believe that the human mind
is just a turing machine.

References: <5.1.1.6.0.20030128205953.01a3b028
How about this news?
Last night in the State of the Union address, Bush repeated the lie
that Iraq is creating nuclear weapons, stating the evidence of the
aluminum tubes purchased, which he claimed were used to enrich
These remarks were made despite the fact, discussed here:
that the International Atomic Energy Agency's report on Monday stated
clearly that the tubes "cannot be used directly for [uranium]
So, Bush is either illiterate or just flat out lying, once again.

I think this is what you call "taxation without representation"
Note also, that the judge in the case was the brother of the supreme
court judge who bush appointed who's totally opposed to these sates
right cases. Great how bush's daughter, the cocaine addict, isn't in jail, but this
man, who was deputized by the city of oakland to grow this marijuana,
is going to be in jail for 20 years. Bush himself was arrested for
DUI, I wish he was rotting in jail instead of ed. disgusting.
