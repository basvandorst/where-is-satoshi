@_subject: Remailer Operator Liability? 
Excerpts from internet.cypherpunks: 17-Jun-96 Re: Remailer Operator
Liabi.. by Duncan Frissell at panix.co I believe we used the term "email exploder" instead of "mailing list,"
particularly in cross-examination and closing arguments, to convey the
idea that such a device is often used for conversation, not just one-way
The fight-censorship list (mail exploder?) is part of the lawsuit, and
my sworn testimony included:
  the list sometimes includes material that could be considered
"indecent" or   "patently offensive."  Minors are not excluded from this
