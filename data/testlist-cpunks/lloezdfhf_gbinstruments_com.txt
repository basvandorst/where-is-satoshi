Wyoming State has bi|lions of do|lars in proven oil and gas reserves. In 2O02, Wyoming ranked second in the U.S. in proved reserves of natural gas and seventh in proved reserves of crude oil. Co||ectively over 26,0O0 we||s produced 54.7 million barrels of oil and 1.75 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
