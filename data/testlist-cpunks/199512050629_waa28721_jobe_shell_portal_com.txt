@_subject: Do the Right Thing 
Sure, I realize this.  I'm very aware of it in fact.  The art of persuasion is the science of selfish self-interest.  Once a
company realizes that their "profits" are in jeopardy, or that
individual corporate officers are liable to face prison time, then
they generally do the "right" thing, what's in their interest.
It's just like asking questions.  You never ask a question to which
you don't already have the answer.
Sure.  This is true.  Facts of Life.  Stiff upper-lip and such.
