you seem to have contracted (sic) the wrong kind of idea about
who/what/how in regards to this list and cryptoparties. dive, lurk,
evaluate, retry?
you should contact cypherpunks-services at al-qaeda.net they will get in touch

you should avoid that ubuntu stuff if you really care
if it's in a webbrowser, it's probably just javascript connected to an
input field, not a full blown keylogger
you don't - there is no way to verify
one reason would be called pragmatism - who are we kidding, there are
more people that just want that certificate than people that aren't
willing to share information about themselves for it
sorry that they don't share your appreciation for related meta discussions
