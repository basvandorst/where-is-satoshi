All right, more people have joined the number theory fun!
Somebody other than myself posted:
To which Peter Murphy asks:
I can, and I'm sure the original poster can as well.  Any book on
number theory should have Wilson's theorem; the second theorem isn't
too difficult to prove.
The first part of the above statement is a direct result of Wilson's
theorem, which I posted in an earlier statement.  A recap:
Wilson's theorem: for any prime p, (p-1)! = -1 mod p
==> (p-1)! + 1 = 0 mod p
See "Elementary Number Theory and its Applications" page 185.
As a consequence of Wilson's theorem:
  for a composite number n, (n-1)! = 0 mod n, except for n = 4
  (for n = 4 you get 2)
==> (n-1)! + 1 != 0 mod n
For a proof, see "Number Theory and its History" page 261.
Hm. hope nobody is getting confused between the factorial notation and
C language "not equals" operator.
More extensive bibliographic information is available (authors,
publishers, etc.) if you want.
