* Contribute your links KFtools for MATLAB
This set of MATLAB tools consists of functions useful for basic image processing and blob analysis. Functions included cover topics like store boundary of binary object as a list of pixel corner coords, select largest binary object, watershed segmentation (flooding from selected sources), centroid of a binary object and more.   Statistical Pattern Recognition Toolbox The toolbox contains both well known pattern recognition methods and recently proposed methods. The toolbox focuses on linear discriminant function including its generalization to quadratic discriminant function by non-linear data mapping, unsupervised learning algorithms and minimax learning algorithms. The demonstrator environment is provided that allows the user to choose different algorithms, compare their behavior, provides tools to control the algorithm run interactively and creates synthetic input data or uses real ones.   Signal Processing using C++ SPUC provides a large and comprehensive set of simple, efficient and reusable DSP building block objects written as C++ classes.
  sbParser - Symbolic C++ Parser
This SDK gives you an easy way to include parsing and calculator objects in your C++ programs.
