That's why you hear about companies creating "data retention" policies.
They're not really about "retention".
The company sets standards that stipulate what records should be kept, how
long, and most importantly to the company that they should be destroyed
after the official retention time has passed.
By setting forth such a policy they can tell a plaintiff "We're sorry, we
don't have those documents/e-mails/data anymore. That data has been
destroyed per our records retention policy".
If they can prove that they have a policy and are following it, they can't
be accused of destroying evidence.
Nifty Huh ?
In defense of companies, it keeps ambulance chasers from subpoenaing ALL the
company's records and then finding some information (a disgruntled
employee's e-mail rant), that taken of context, makes the company appear
After e-mails were used by the DOJ as "evidence" that Micro$oft was guilty
of "anti-competitive" practices, it was quietly proposed by legal department
at a company I know of that the e-mail system be configured to automatically
delete users e-mail after a set time period, and not allow the easy off-line
storage of messages. It was handily rejected by the IT department as
impossible to implement and shouted down by many managers who didn't want
their CYA e-mails automatically deleted.

Satire imitates life:
I was watching "The Big Comfy Couch" (a children's show on PBS) with my
three year old. Their revision of the fable was to have the ants invite the
grasshopper in to their home for the winter because they realized they had
no music to sing or dances to do.
The moral seemed to be 'We need  the fools who laugh, sing, dance, and play
the summer away, because they are "artists"'.
It pissed me off.
(I think the Ants singing "Nayah-Nayah-Nayah" while dancing on the
Grasshopper's grave would have been sufficient).

Probably not a good idea to use ants as the heroes in YOUR story since they
are probably the best example of the subjugation of individual freedoms to
the goals of a society.
However, I found an interesting discussion of the fable and it's variants
at: I thought this version was interesting:
The ants work hard all summer, producing products and services, such as in
manufacturing, farming, and transportation. Grasshoppers laugh and dance and
play all summer, without producing anything.
Come winter though, the productive ants are hungry and shivering, while the
unproductive grasshoppers are warm and well-fed! How did this happen?
Easy: the grasshoppers own the land the hardworking ants live and work on.
The grasshoppers collect land taxes from the ants, but call it land "rent".
Since the grasshoppers did not produce the land, these land taxes (land
"rent" payments) are really welfare payments to grasshoppers.
Some grasshoppers are somewhat productive, providing building maintenance
for their tenants. But the part of the "rent" that is simply a payment for
using the land, which the grasshoppers did not make, is simply a land tax,
used for welfare payments to grasshopper- landlords.
Some grasshoppers used to make the mistake of calling these land payments by
what they are: land taxes. But then libertarians raised a fuss, since
they're against taxes. So, the grasshoppers changed the name, and started
calling the land payments land "rent". Then the libertarians said "Oh,
that's different. Go right ahead and collect these land payments from the
ants." And they did. And they still do.
This version of the fable is by Mike O'Mara.
On the humorous side: (See  ).

"I'm sorry I have to tell you this Mr. & Mrs. May, but the genetic tests required by your insurance company have revealed that your unborn child has a 65% chance of developing an expensive to treat and possibly severely debilitating condition requiring many operations, doctor visits, therapy, special equipment, round the clock nursing. etc. Since we have already passed this information on to your insurance company as required by the terms of your policy, they are recommending and will pay you to terminate the pregnancy and to have both you and your husband sterilized. Otherwise they will not pay for your pre-natal care, the delivery, or any future treatment of your child.
Of course you can opt for our "High Genetic Risk Policy" at $XXXXX thousands of dollars a month (which is probably equal to or more expensive than the cost of paying for the possible medical costs on your own IF the condition occurs. Which you would, since Medicare/Medicaid was ended in the last round of "Compassionate Conservatism").
We will be passing this information onto your brothers, sisters and other relatives insurance companies so they can require their sterilization. Frankly, your entire family tree needs to be "pruned" to coin a phrase.

  Are you claiming that DNA collected by the police is then given to   insurance companies?
  An audacious claim. Do you evidence to support this extraordinary claim?

  rapist or somesuch, the police went around collecting DNA samples
  and arresting anyone who refused. After all, only someone with something
  to hide would refuse. Of course, this was television.
  As for insurance companies "discriminating," this is what I hope for.   Those of us who don't engage in certain practices--smoking, sky   diving, anal sex, whatever--should not be subsidizing those who do.   This is the beauty of "opt out" plans.
  Yes, only the genetically pure deserve health care. And you are sure
  that the insurance companies won't opt you out when they get a good
  look at your DNA?
  But the first order of business is for you to support your claim that   DNA is collected by the police and then shared with insurance   companies.

Heaven forbid Here's a good quote even:
"The use of dollar profit as the only criterion to be used in decision
making often leads to decisions with good short-term profit properties, but
poor social outcomes for the people  involved (and often, as a result, poor
long-term profit prospects)."
"The net value approach used in this book assumes that ALL  [Author's

Same deal.  I'd rather it not be polluted in the first place.

It's not a zero-sum game for the insurance companies. Most insurance
companies make  quite a bit of money investing premiums.
In addition, they spread the risk. They are betting that more people will
stay well than get sick.
And I'm not talking about people "engaging in risky behavior". I'm talking
about someone who has a genetic predisposition for a disease THAT THEY HAVE
NO ABILITY TO MITIGATE.
I have no problem charging someone who smokes, takes drugs, or over eats.
THEY HAVE A CHOICE.
I am also not saying that Mr. Insurance CEO can only make $XXX in profit.
I'm sure they can make a profit.
In fact they are making profits right now WITHOUT using genetic testing.

Any parent who lets a child have a TV or a computer in their bedroom now
days is nuts.
(Okay, My parents let me have my C64 in my bedroom, but I quickly got tired
of downloading monochrome porn at 300 baud and went back to playing
"Jumpman".  ;) ).
We severely limit our kids (both < 5 yrs old) TV time. Even then, they watch
mostly videos. Even some of those we have to fast forward through the
"previews" because of the content, ( An ad for "Batman" on a "There goes an
Bulldozer!" video, come on!).
However, that's my responsibility as parent, and not something I desire to
give up to anyone else non-voluntarily.
As for the V-Chip. I've seen enough programs rated "For All Ages" that are
not appropriate for  young kids to know that they are worthless. (By the way
I want a P-chip to filter Politicians, a BB-(Bible Beater) chip to filter
out the 700 Club. etc. I seem to remember that's what made the billions for
the character in Sagan's "Contact" ).
I do miss the old Bugs Bunny/Road Runner cartoons with their senseless
violence :)
If you haven't watched them lately on Saturday morning you'll find that they
have been heavily censored/edited to be quite PC.

Of course being considered an ISP or "provider" may mean you have to comply
with CALEA and provide LEO's wiretap access.
Between a rock and a hard place ?
Of course wiretap access to data encrypted elsewhere wouldn't do anyone much

Capturing and analyzing the traffic between the browser session and the bank
would be a good place to start.
I believe there is a tool for Windoze that will let you packet sniff (even a
PPP) connection.
My employer blocks certain versions of browser's from going through our
firewall because
of reported security vulnerabilities. Yeah, I know it's easy to spoof, but
it insures that our "less sophisticated" users upgrade.
The bank may have been concerned about a security problem in the version of
the browser you were using.
Then again, they could of just said that, I guess (unless they were doing
the "security through obscurity"  bit).
You could try getting the source for Mozzilla, verifying it,  compiling it,
and then trying to access your bank.

I was listening to a radio program on NPR (The cypherpunks favorite statist
medium :) ).
They were discussing the problems with the certification of kosher food.
Evidently there are many different organizations with differing ideas on
what it takes to be kosher.
They interviewed one restaurant owner who follows kosher practices and has
been certified by a rabbi.
However, the local kosher certification organization says he isn't because
he doesn't have a full time rabbi on staff in the kitchen (who just happens
to HAVE to be from their organization). So most orthodox Jews won't eat
Kind of sounds like a "protection racket" to me.
