   [1]ruzel writes "Julian Bleecker's web site [2]TechKwonDo describes
   [3]a project that is a wifi base station in a backpack. 'WiFi.Bedouin
   is a wearable, mobile 802.11b node disconnected from the global
   Internet. It forms a WiFi "island Internet" challenging conventional
   assumptions about WiFi and suggesting new architectures for digital
   networks that are based on physical proximity rather than solely
   connectivity.' The motivation is essentially subversive but what other
   uses are there for a device like this?"
