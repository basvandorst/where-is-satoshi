too only partially.
Unfortunately, premail doesn't check the signatures. The only signatures
that pgp can recognize and verify are the self signatures (easy to spoof).
Note that even if the public keys of other signatories are included
in the pubring (unlike now), it will still be easy to spoof the signatures
if one can alter the pubring. The only safe way is to have a public key
generated by Raph included in the premail distribution and then sign the
pubring.pgp file at kiwi.cs.berkeley.edu, and/or its individual keys with it.
Here are three experments, all of which I did. The results are eye-opening.
1) Run premail with +debug=rv . pgp will warn about not being able to
verify signatures.
2) Do a pgp -kvv ~/.premail/pubring.pgp. You will see that all signatures
are either self-signatures or are unverifiable by pgp.
3) Do the following (lines starting with % are C shell commands. Lines
starting with # are comments. Don't enter them directly.)
% mkdir /tmp/k
% setenv PGPPATH /tmp/k
% cp ~/.premail/pubring.pgp /tmp/k
# Remove exon's key
% pgp -kr remailer at remailer.nl.com /tmp/k/pubring.pgp
# Make a new key for exon.
# When pgp prompts for user-id enter
# Senator Exon # You may want to specify the lowest key size, 384, for convenience, and
# an easy passphrase such as `exon'.
% pgp -kg
# Make a mail file.
% cat > /tmp/k/mail <<!
Is this really encrypted for Senator Exon, or for the spooks?
# Backup your ~/.premail/pubring.pgp
% cp ~/.premail/pubring.pgp ~/.premail/pubring.pgp.BAK
# Now premail the mail file.
# You have two choices.
# If you have lynx installed, use this command. And make sure
# that enough time has expired since the last time you ran premail,
# so it is forced to download the pubring.
# This command is one line. It might have been folded by your mail reader,
# so unfold it.
% premail +storefile=/tmp/k/mailout.pgp +debug=rv +pubring-url=file:/tmp/k/pubring.pgp -t < /tmp/k/mail
# If you don't have lynx, just manually copy the pubring file to your
# .premail directory, and then run premail as follows. This time, make
# sure that premail doesn't download the pubring file, by not giving it
# enough time since you last ran it.
# The cp and the premail are both one line commands. Correct any folding.
% cp /tmp/k/pubring.pgp ~/.premail
% premail +storefile=/tmp/k/mailout.pgp +debug=rv -t < /tmp/k/mail
# Now see if you, the spook, can decrypt the file that normally premail
# would have send off to exon, blissfully unaware that the spooks are waiting
# to catch it.
# Use the pass phrase you chose when you did the pgp -kg step above.
% pgp /tmp/k/mailout.pgp
% cat /tmp/k/mailout
# Gee. Looks like the spooks got your mail, huh?
# If you can't decrypt /tmp/k/mailout.pgp the premail step used a different
# pubring than /tmp/k/pubring.pgp. Make sure /tmp/k/pubring.pgp and
# ~/.premail/pubring.pgp are identical, remove /tmp/k/mailout.pgp and
# run premail again.
# Restore everything.
% mv ~/.premail/pubring.pgp.BAK ~/.premail/pubring.pgp
% unsetenv PGPPATH
% rm -rf /tmp/k
# Convinced?

withstand such sofisticated attacks as traffic analysis, it is too bad
the tool which most people probably use to access the remailers is
vulnerable to a simple spoofing attack such as this.
Mallories. If they want to wiretap a particular person, a Mallory on his/her
Internet link is all that is needed. This Mallory can spoof both the incoming
pubring.pgp and the outgoing encrypted mail.
any value, we discuss ways to eliminate this vulnerability from premail.
Maybe we should take the discussion to cryptography, or coderpunks,
or even premail-dev?

There is nothing unglamorous about a known plaintext attack, if the
plaintext is choosen carefully. I don't know anything about bank ATMs
and the protocols they use, but I presume the PIN is stored on the card
single DES encrypted. If this is so, anyone can take an ATM card, attack it
to recover the key and then use that key to recover the PIN for any stolen
ATM card of that bank (or that branch). Hopefully, the ciphertext/plaintext
pair that RSA announces will be a real target like this, with the actual key
disabled. Once the key is recovered, the press can then claim that ATM
cards are not safe any longer.
On a related note, do you think the key will first be recovered by a
hardware device or by the Great Internet DES Key Search? Hardware is
much faster, but no such device exists in the private/amateur sector
now. Estimates are that it will take 10 months to actually build such
a device. Opinions?

cryptanalytic skills against this, but this particular cryptogram
has already been decrypted and the plain text posted to sci.crypt a
few days back by Jim Gillogly. The message ID is <32D445A4.3DF at mentat.com>
using the same algorithm. It is titled `decryption' and the plain text
starts with "There are plenty of programs you could buy such as".
Mr. Gillogly broke that too. See news:<32DA7FE4.1F41 at mentat.com>

Not true. It will take a MIM machine less than a tenth of a second to
come up with a 3DES key that will have the same three digit hash.
Remember the attack found about Clipper's LEAF hash, which was only
16 bits long?
