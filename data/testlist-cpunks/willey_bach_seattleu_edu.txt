@_subject: REMAILERS: standard xx-To: line 
matt just mentioned that remailer at soda doesn't accept "Request-Remailing-To" header lines (which explains why i thought it was dead) and i note that not all other remailers accept "Anon-Send-To:".  anarchy has it's place in our lives but, it would be nice to cut down on sode come in remailing and ping scripts.  the three close to standard headers seem to be "Anon-Send-To:", "Request-Remailing-To:", and "X-Anon-To:".  it would be more convenient :) for all remailers to either allow all three or settle on one standard (nfl).

@_subject: magic money clients doing business with more than one server? 
i now have 10Ghost Marcs.  now, for something to spend them on ;)
next question, can one client hold coins of different currencies?  it appears that it can't.  for one thing the bank.key is a single key and not a keyring.  is it worth adapting mgmny clients to handle multiple currencies (servers)?  has this already be discussed?  what do people think of releasing the mgmny package with the necessary pgptls
code together so that people who only want magic money need only fetch one
archive file, not both mgmny and pgptools?  i have both the client and server binaries for SunOS4.1.3 that i will gladly make available (via email, i have no ftp option) right, i now have 10Gm.  now, for something to spend them on ;)
