   Invitation to all Cypherpunks to join the San Diego crowd at "The Mission

topical CP stuff.  There's always the semi-topical discussions; Internet

privacy services), stelth communications, latest Cypherpunk goings-on,
Internet happenings (like recent Federal court decision).

out how to get it on the back of a business card, that would be cool.  Place: The Mission Cafe & Coffee Shop
