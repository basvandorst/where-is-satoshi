Excerpts from internet.cypherpunks: 23-Apr-96 Re: Rabbi Hier Testimony
by Declan McCullagh at CMU.EDU While I'm at it, I should offer my prediction that the Southern Poverty
Law Center likely will become active in attempts to regulate and control
the Net.
To the SPLC, bomb-building and other, um, incendiary information should
be restricted. In today's Washinton Post, Morris Dees, the Center's
co-founder, indicates that a book Timothy McVeigh read influenced him to
bomb the Oklahoma City building.

"E. ALLEN SMITH" The Simon Wiesenthal Center and the ADL would love to outlaw anonymity
on the Net. Here's some info on their attempts to restrict online speech:
CDT report on Hier's testimony at Senate hearing last May:
  ACLU's *detailed* reporting on SWC's longtime net-censorship attempts:
   ADL decries "web of hate":
  ADL research analyst's personal position on Internet hate speech:
  ADL claims information is seductive, needs to be censored:   IHR (biased) reporting on SWC/ADL net-censorship attempts:
   How ADL tries to recruit hackers to sabotage enemies' computers:
   SWC tries to muzzle critics in Argentina, Canada:      SWC exaggerates "hate speech" threat for funding and self-perpetuation:
      The EF Canada web pages also detail how the SWC has been trying to get
the Canadian equivalent of the FCC to regulate the Internet. The ACLU
reports at the URL above how the SWC has tried the same trick here in
the U.S.
