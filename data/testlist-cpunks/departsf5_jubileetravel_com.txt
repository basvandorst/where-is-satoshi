me um we didnt have computers in our homes then
all day the kids hung out at that corner played on that grass got drinks out of that hose went through the secret passage way in the juniper bushes and only left the area to go around the block over and over again sometimes it was on bikes with banana seats sometimes roller skates sometimes big wheels sometimes walking even occasionally on skateboards with cardboard boxes on them (our cars) i was born in orange county where my parents had lived in the same house for like 20 years they had both lived in so cal all their lives i will i will i will please hold me accountable if you dont see the results posted next week the inspiration pieces

dear anne shirley its been a long time since i last wrote but i need your advice i am planning a primary activity for this spring since our theme for the year is my eternal family and we like to have our activities point the children to what they are learning i thought it might be nice if we have a picnic on or near the grounds of the mt timpanogos temple and let them bask in the beauty of that place and reflect on the importance of their own eternal family
it made me happy
seriously though my closest friends are fun real and honest good entertaining in love with life a little crazy down to earth deep and incapable of bs
cate did you love disney games on the computer when you were five
say hi to gilbert and the kids with love km
i am given glimpses of the why and the good and the reasons and the plan the bigger picture and the necessity for some to not fit the mold
i look for girls with purses that compliment mine
im just obsessed with him
