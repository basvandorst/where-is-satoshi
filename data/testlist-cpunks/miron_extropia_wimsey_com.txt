I've set up a new remailer.  I am currently working on extensions.  Here
are the details:
Address: remail at extropia.wimsey.com
Contact: miron at extropia.wimsey.com
Encryption: PGP 2.1
    Compatible with Hal-standard remailers, except for a couple of things:
    - Encryption MUST be used.
    - Syntax can be simplified.  The pasting operator is assumed.
    The "Encrypted:" header is optional.  Accordingly, you can
    just encrypt plaintext of the following form (without the
    cut-here lines):
    --- cut here ---
    To:     --- cut here ---
    In any case, one should be able to use the scripts posted
    on cypherpunks without change.
Availability: continuous, approx 2 hr turnaround or better.

Here is a post which is somewhat relevant:
Summary: New decision by Ninth Circuit may affect BBS operators
     The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled, in US vs X-Citement
Video Inc., (CA No. 89-50556), that the sections of the Protection of
Children Against Sexual Exploitation Act of 1977 that deal with distribution, transportation, and receipt of sexually explicit materials are invalid on First Amendment grounds.  The court let stand the prohibition on the production of child pornography.
     This ruling needs to be looked at more closely, but it may help to
remove sysop worries about someone posting such material on their system
without their knowledge, or about network nodes being liable for material passing through them.  This is a step forward, because it was
one of the very few real legal risks a US sysop had to face, and now
it appears to be dead. Do the lawyers out there agree with this analysis?
     Producing child pornography remains illegal, which is reasonable.

@_subject: My remailer and ARA's 
My remailer does not support ARA's.  This is because the requirement
that incoming messages be completely encrypted with its key (any
portion which is not encrypted in this way is dropped).
In any case, the current scheme for ARA's is insecure.  This is
because people can send plaintext messages attached to the ARA.
This allows breaking anonymity by monitoring of the traffic from
all remailers and waiting until the message appears at one of
the outputs.
I will implement a more secure scheme.  The ARA will include
encryption instructions for each remailer.  Since each remailer
will be doing a transformation on the message, the attack above
will not be feasible.

@_subject: Some proposals to consider 
It would be very nice if PGP behaved better as a UNIX filter.  For
example, I'd like it to return an exit code if it fails.  I'd
also like it to have a flag that disables any access to the tty
for prompts.  For example, if I have an automatic  filter that
tries to decrypt all incoming messages, I don't want it to prompt
for a secret ring file when it can't decrypt something.
A very important addition to PGP would be multi-recipient encryption.
RIPEM implements this nicely, by having one private key (PGP has this
too - it uses IDEA) and encrypting this key with each recipient's key.
We could then run this list encrypted, in order to excercise PGP
and to see what user interface issues become important with heavy use.

There are two other options:
- Have the mix accessible to only a selected group.  Provide the group
with signed certificates.  It is possible to sign certificates such
that they are untracable to their owner, exactly like crypto money.
A security concern here is that the mix owner can tell when the
same user uses the mix more than once (but the owner can't tell
which user).
- Charge for the mix services with crypto-money.  The crypto-money
could be some networking service.  It could be even mix transmission.
For example, the basic currency could be the transmission of 10K
through a mix.  One would have to create a mix and let the bank
route some traffic through it thereby putting credits in your
account.  Once you have credits, you could spend them anywhere.
One might want to fiddle with the definition of the currency so
that it does not depreciate with time.
I prefer the second option.  I think mixes and crypto-money really
go hand in hand.

@_subject: Modem encryption proposal 
Let's talk less and do more. :)
How about adding encryption to kermit and iScreen so that they may
talk to each other in a secure manner?  I am proposing these two
programs because they are widely portable.  kermit works on most
Unix and MSDOS systems.  iScreen works on most Unix systems.
(Note that this would solve the network/modem eavesdropping problem,
but not the untrusted remote system problem.  The latter has no
solution in my opinion.  You just have to trust the sysadmin.)
I propose writing a link encryption library which could be usable
in other comm and BBS programs.
Any takers?
BTW, watch for an encrypted Unix talk program coming to a ftp site
near you.

A pool is used for *replying* to anon mail.  The problem is that it's hard  to build a system that allows replies to anon email and still maintains  absolute security.  One way is to broadcast the reply.  A pool does just  that - it's basically a mailing list.  It could be a newsgroup.
Since any of the subscribers to the pool could be the intended recipient  of any particular message, it would be very hard to use the pool to trace  the anonymous recipient.

correction by using error detection and retransmission.  This

@_subject: ARA security 
Proposition 1:
All remailing schemes are vulnerable in the case that all remailing
sites in the chain are compromised before transmission.
Proposition 2:
With ARAs and direct transmission (one recipient at each hop), if the
first n-1 hosts in a chain are compromised then the n_th host identity
is known.  If all hosts are compromised, the originator is known.
Corollary 1:
Direct-transmission ARAs are vulnerable to an adversary that can
compromise any small subset of all hosts.  This is done by sequentially
compromising the next host, and using that information to find
the identity of the next host after that.  No amount of "random"
routing has any effect in this case, since the randomness is implemented
by each host, but each host is compromised before it makes the delivery.
Proposition 3:
Normal anonymous transmission (not ARA) is "unconditionally" secure
after *one* passage through an uncompromised host, assuming no
traffic analysis and no log files.  (With log files, normal
transmission is as insecure as direct-transmission ARAs.)
Therefore, it seems like direct-transmission ARAs are much less
secure than normal anonymous transmission.  For better security,
we must find some other ARA scheme.

Last revised Tue May 25 21:05:50 PDT 1993.
What is YTalk?
YTalk is a multi-user drop-in replacement for the UNIX "talk" program.
I have added encryption facilities to it, including private key and
PGP authentication.
- Multi user capabilities.
- Drop in replacement for /usr/ucb/talk.
- Diffie-Hellman exponential key exchange for session keys.
- IDEA encryption in CFB mode.
- Password authentication.
- PGP authentication.
- Logging of conversations to a file.
Known bugs and misfeatures
- No security the first time you use it, until the random seed file
  is created (around 300 keystrokes).
- Some problems with the talk daemons on Ultrix and SCO-Unix.
- Port to Alpha (64bit) incomplete.
