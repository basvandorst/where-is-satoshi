Thanks for the post.  I think there are a few interesting points, and some of the things I do to try to make things more difficult for a potential virus.
First, my secring is on a PCMCIA memory card, as is the versions of PGP, in this case DOS and Linux.  A virus is unlikely to attack both, and when the memory card is in, the network and modem cards are out.
Second, I think PGP is statically linked by default.  If it isn't this shoudl be changed - there was recently a CERT alert about telnet services being compromised by switching DLLs.  The code can also be cross compiled and burned onto a CDROM which would make it difficult to infect.

Is there a FAQ or other list of anonymous remailers?  Or how to use the one at portal.com (I had this info somewhere, but it takes forever to do a zgrep `find...).

My original post mentioned two things, the other was to cross-compile the sources.  Maybe do it on 3 different systems (e.g. Sun, HP and DEC), and compare the binaries, then burn a CD.  A virus would have to be very versatile to infect multiple platforms and insert code for another.
It would also be silly for a virus to just dump keys when PGP runs, it would be far easier to look for any occurance of secring.pgp, and mail it, and/or monitor when it was opened and record keystrokes.  And log files
must go somewhere.
I don't know if I mentioned, but I keep PGP and my keys on pcmcia memory cards that aren't in the system at the same time as a network or modem card.  Moreover I can also simply use the DOS version (I use linux to communicate) - It would require quite an effort to create a virus that would work and pass data across the required OS problems and not break with the twice a week kernel-level changes :).
ViaCrypt also has a PCMCIA implementation of pgp, and it should be fairly easy to implement in an ASIC, or small embedded micro.  That would be much harder to compromise.  Of course anything so useful commercially woudl be the subject of our legal system.
It takes quite an effort to create a complex virus to do this.  It reminds me of the Glomar Challenger that was used to recover the remains of a russian sub (my memory is somewhat faulty).  Such a virus would require a great investment in time and money.  What target would be worth it?
Many otherwise feasible things aren't economically pracitcal.

The virus is starting to get large and noticeable.  First, I alternate between a.out and ELF (and DOS .EXE). It doesn't have to patch pgp, just look for it to be loaded and teh secring file accessed.  Then record keystrokes.  This would also work with a hardware implementation if the secring passphrase is external (as opposed to an external keypad).
This is what can be done when PGP is used for communication.  For other info, I can isolate a computer (no modem, unroutable IP addresses, etc).
Of course our firewall is a socks server and doesn't forward UDP.  Maybe a socksified, SSL virus?  My computer is attatched that way far more than via modem.  And maybe I should just nuke (or modularize) UDP?  You can do interesting things with kernel source.
That woudl be interesting - even with the speaker "off" the power surge causes clicking and other signs.  Not to mention that the interrupt count would start moving (of course the virus could replace the entire OS and would only have to find 300K chunks to hide in).
Were they that interested, they could place a surveillence device over my desk (I don't know if they can pick up the scan on LCDs like they can on monitors - I am suprised they didn't put the kybosh to the FCC emission rules).  Maybe I can move my desk, or my pgp station inside our EMI testing faraday cage :).

But it would also have to hide in something you load at boot time.  For it to propogate there, it would have to make copies of itself. when crond and inetd and named all grow over 400K I get curious.  Dos has small usage, and Linux provides a link map (or I can checksum entry points or such).  Another fun thing to do is pkexe or gzexe.  The latter turns an exe into a shell script.  Patching compressed files is very difficult.
