I'm highly critical this news. Think about it, what is the intended benefit of coming out with such a discovery.
It's like proclaiming to Germany that we broke the Enigma-code during WW2.

References: Well, first off it is commonly known that aiding and abetting a known terrorist group is a crime anywhere. Especially if it's one no one with disreputable hobbies like ISIS.
Secondly, I'd like to present the following hypothesis: the actuator or the currency used to procure whatever an ISIS-fighter might want or need will take the form of US$ in exchange for some commodity.
But I won't digress on that point. What is important is if governments are so easy to point out that things beyond their control are so nefarious because they themselves are unable to control it, I'd like to suggest that they start by controlling streams of goods and services that they themselves are contributing to the prolonged existence of ISIS.
We, the informed community, all know most of their equipment comes from sponsors that are nations that would persecute this very person for aiding and abetting. Where as when a member of U.S. Congress or the CIA lend a helping hand to the "resistance" in the form of war-materials and supporting services it is considered but a faux pas.

This is not meaningful speculation since the main point is of the story is not finding out who to blame, it is spreading FUD about the fallout of Ed's actions by spreading blatant lies. Which basically derails a developing dialog: Ed was right, there /was/ overreach/abuse and accounts of premeditated lying attributable to our Government(s) fine It's fun to watch the government losing face by trying to cover it up.
What I saw was a five year old with his hand stuck in the cookie jar. Only the cookie jar is actually the privacy of my own home. No matter the fact that I extend my presence to locations around the globe by way of internets. I am not forgoing my rights to privacy when I directly communicate with others. The very same way I find those rights in the confines of my home.

Tom Harper, the Sunday Times' journalist who wrote the article. The man who repeatedly lied about the the state of affairs regarding Ed landed himself an interview with CNN. It was aired a few hours ago. The man dug himself a hole, jumped into his hole and buried himself with an explanation of how he reports what.
Effectively he told CNN that it is speculation, that he reports what he feels to be the truth as provided by his sources within the government but that what he reported is not explicitly mentioned as such, and that it is up to his sources "the government" (whatever that means) to provide proof.
In other words, he lied. Many bad things did not happen. And I'm sure that the OPSEC that Glenn et al. have been maintaining is for the sake of all parties involved. And I bet that three-letter agencies have reached out to him to let him know that he's walking a fine line and I'm sure that Glenn also knows that they have a vested interest in the information not becoming freely available.
And that's the end of that story.
We're also not discussing the semantics of how Glenn handles his files in the face of what is an obvious push to erode civil liberties. Because.

The reason for this is the work that /all/ of these institutes do. It is bigger then what an individual or, is some cases, a small group can accomplish. And can easily be undermined if details are published. Who is it to say that what CIA has been doing is not in U.S. best interest. You? Me?
How many people know that the institute been used as a road to power? 5? 10? 10.000? We know that in hindsight Bush Senior during his days as the captain was very much so into promoting his own agenda. He did things that if you and me would do 'm we'd be locked up, gassed or otherwise effectively terminated. An agenda, that in is own head, is in the best interest of the U.S.
How does the institute itself look upon itself? We don't know. But most likely they are EXACTLY what I'd expect from the U.S. public in general:
If it were that easy to breed even a thing as consensus among the American public, to whom admitting to be false or admitting that they do not hold all the key information is far more likely to be interpreted as a personal attack then parsed on a rational level as self-criticism... the enablers of many mad politicians would have a hard(er) time.
I can tell you that any low-level contractor or employee /with /brains looks upon the three-letter institutes and sees exactly that. And they are even allowed to. Ed walked around the office in a EFF sweater. And the CIA very well knows that they can not change that mentality.
So accountability does JACK SHIT. Transparency does not change the equation, because, people cling to power. And even now a lot of things are out there, in the open, we, as a nation are still O.K. with electing Jeb Bush into office (I think he'll win).
However, bending, massaging the general public in a slow, but very effective way does yield it's rewards. As we know, Ed's work steered/stirred public debate on some level.
It is a cultural issue. It is not like people are going to suffer from cognitive dissonance if they do not allow themselves to peep outside of the box.
That sounds quite nihilistic. People will do what ever they can come up with. Unless someone tells them: "No, you can not do this. And if you do, I'm here to stop you." However, as long as people cling to power, the enablers so to speak, are there will be hard times ahead for people that are on the shitty end of the shtick.
True. Especially if it is concerned a people's government. But that would re-frame reality in which secrets serve a purpose. Most battles are preceded by a conspiracy of some kind. A conspiracy usually requires a great deal of security. And I'd like to venture into saying that people in power will not give up the power they legitimately have. Ever. Most of the public debate has been polarized to the point that people planting themselves on the middle ground of any argument are eaten by both sides anyway. There is a reason why people are closed gays, atheists, black, smurfs, anarchists, etcetera. If everyone would be as understanding as you and I we would not have to have this discussion in the first place.
But we don't live in that world. People do hurt each other per-emptively because of a difference in culture, color, flag etc.

In theory.
Let's come down to the realm of things we run into in the wild.
Figments of theory-crafting because someone thought of a certain attack vector is not what anyone concerned about real life issues considers a It's an academic exercise.
If you want to theory-craft, expand on the RSA infiltration. Pre-computed elliptic curves seem to be the next forefront. Are the capabilities of agencies up to par with what we know and throw at them. Brute-forcing is, after all, anyone's game.
I'd like people to look into the intellectual wasteland that is the mobile phone industry. Those are vectors that the intelligence community has about full control over. Not your dumb-ass VGA card.
I simply don't get why people that own a phone worry about things that are not even remotely proven to be an actual issue.

So, you have no knowledge of all the details of the CIA's actions, but you are sure that they consist of violations? Is that right?
By the way, the CIA is under congressional oversight. That is where accountability ends. They don't have to explain themselves to you.
How effective is this oversight? I think the vast majority Members of Congress in general do not have the cognitive skills to understand the issues that the CIA creates. Let alone come to an agreement on how to handle the agency.
To summarize the problem: the CIA is has about 20.000 employees. Which is substantially bigger then in the 1950s where they had maybe about 4-5.000. They are an intelligence office. They started out gathering intelligence, gained intelligence gathering capabilities and now have capabilities to operate independently to some extent for some years.
Now, we know they spy on Congress. Manipulate congress. Overthrow governments. Steer elections. But who controls them? With no oversight they basically do 'whatever' and 'whatever' is quite a dangerous thing to do. Now, in hindsight, I don't care if they go around the world and bully people into playing nice. But that is besides the point.
The problem is the culture. Recent breaches of security contractors have shown that information technology information gatherers (ITIG) employs a lot of clowns. Like you, you want a polarized version of the world where the CIA is bad. Just bad. And by your own admission you don't even care what they do, you are just looking to punish them. That is not a data driven assessment, it's just operating on assumptions. Which is what the U.S. Government's foreign policies are based on. Which is why I know that either a. the CIA does not hold it's information gathering capabilities to a professional standard, or b, they listen to clowns.
And this brings us back to the CIA who is SUPPOSED TO JUST FUCKING BE MIDDLE MANAGEMENT. Instead they gave middle management a gun and told them to go fix things in the world. Middle management has always been decorated five U.S. flags, with sprinkles with red white and blue and enough U.S. jingoism to fill a stadium. I.e. it created the CIA.
Now I assume, as a Congressional committee, that every time you ask the CIA for a report on a foreign issue they do a little sing and dance and ask for more money to go solve it. Because the following things are *always* valid: a. They can claim they have limited capabilities to get men on the ground. and b. With the right people and equipment and amount of cash Congress does not have to send in the military if things get really nasty if they solve it for them.
Other then that I don't think people working for the CIA are that different from the majority in that they polarize the world to preserve their sanity: They want every Arab to be bad. And actively want to know everything about them, just to make them look bad. They know that ever Congress Member or committee might not vote in their best interest, so everyone needs to be manipulated.
And if I had a track record of overthrowing governments, fixing elections and operating with impunity overseas because foreign governments *allow* them. I'd be feeling pretty awesome about myself too. All the while they are operating under the grace of congress.
This is not the only institute that grew out of control in the United And the fact that I don't sleep well is that even if I printed this piece of text on a piece of paper and went around congress and tacked it on each of their foreheads it would not change anything. It is just that to be make a person aware of a problem does not give them the skills or knowledge to deal with it.
And really, all congress has to do is take the gun away from middle management. This ofc is a bad analogy. I believe everyone should be able to carry a gun if they please.
Yes. I like my country. I has lots of nice people.
Considering what you said about the problems with nationalistic think in your last paragraph I take this as an admission you're well versed in I don't need a stronk Russia. Russian culture is not conducive to how I'd like people to run things. Emphasis on people. Not the government.
The Ed event would still have happened. It is just the retarded notion that to be make a person aware of somehow gives them the insight to deal with it.
I frankly don't care. I just don't want them to have the ability to muck things up. Because it kinda proves they have issues. I don't mind them doing good for the wrong reasons. It's doing bad for the right reasons.
The CIA has very well funded issues. VERY WELL FUNDED... VERY WELL... VERY... WELL... funded? And if they don't get the funds directly they start running dope and sell guns.
So, CIA's issues are a domestic issue. So I'm pointing my finger at Congress. And since this is a democracy I'm kinda limited to the rule of the majority.

No, we know that it's not necessarily in the best interest of stability, people outside of the U.S. or the U.S. for that matter. Apart from creating a unipolar world. And how the status quo serves the U.S. Which, not unlike smoking cigarettes causes cancer but reliefs my anxiety. Not saying that the CIA causes cancer. But I'm also not saying that the CIA functions in the best interest of the US. But I don't even think we want to have this discussion.
Yes. Agreed.
Not much of a government then eh? This is mostly semantics. As a non-ISIS-supporter I'd like to see ISIS' governing body overthrown and their constituents heading in a different direction. But yea, that might mean your principles take a hit.
Simply not true. Transgressions yes. But to put it like that is polarizing the issue. How many pin France as the steward of the Vietnamese conflict?
How many pin the ECB as the steward of growing inequality in Greece? Cases of kids fainting from malnutrition? With all their economists they could not reliably tell Greece was never fit to join the Monetary Union?
Europe's unilaterally dropping the ball on Ukraine, and in very recent history, Kosovo.
Yes, great starting point.
Actually, more specifically it's a concentration of power in the hands of a few (1?) individual(s).
European diplomacy works only because of NATO. And NATO  is U.S. Firepower to put it bluntly.
The fact that Putin understands that projecting power without repercussions is so delicious. You really want to be at the mercy of a that person? Talk about concentrated power....
"The World" is very good digging it's own grave.
Surely, you understand why they did this? There is a perfectly good rationale for running these kind of operations. It's just that you're miffed about the fact that you're not able to do anything about it.
So if you're part of some impotent government that does not know how to, or wants to project power, instantly you're at the mercy of institutions of governments that can. No amount of tree-hugging or moral high ground is going to save you from extinction.
And it's not all that bad. It's mostly power-play and politics really.

"People aren't against you, they are for themselves." is a much greater truism then trying to find reason in foreign politics or actions of governments. And if these sensible "Russian" ideas proliferate wherever you're from, why do you live in a country that does not even have a unified military and has Generals that do however they please?

Civil liberties actually supersede religion. In very much the same way that my God supersedes your Civil Liberties. I get what you're getting at but I don't agree. Ah, "Civil Liberties" we could could treat them as semantics but really, they are quite the pillar of society and a lot more tangible and concrete to which a religion is not a particularly grand substitute.

Ah, I stand corrected. Anyway, I think this is BAD.
Yes, my government is not what I would put in power. But I don't have much influence (any, really) over who and what get's chosen around here. So, to assume that I have anything to do with it is stretching reality a bit. But you're welcome to shoot them a mail and tell them how you feel about all of it.
Or come and tell 'm in person. The U.S. is wonderful place, safe to travel. You make the appointment and I'll buy you a beer after you've had your disappointment.
So, it's not like I 'let' them. I am  not the one they ask how I feel when the CIA decided they want to torture or murder Harry, Mo or Barry for information. They don't even bother telling me really. And to be honest I think they'd rather keep it a secret from me.
And remember that chart of US military bases that that other guy put up. Who is 'letting' them really, because even if it was me, and it isn't. It would be me and everyone else. Because there is such a thing as vested interests. And as the saying gos: Rome wasn't build in a day. But it sure as hell burned down in one.

I think that for the most part we're on the same page. The only thing is, is that, there is a reason a lot of these things happen the way they are decided upon by impressionable people basing their decisions based on wrong information. Or people trying to prolong the status quo.
And the way I get  exposed to things are different. I'm not trying to cloud the issue. It's just that you don't want/can/able to see what drives (bad) decision makers.
I actually do know why certain decisions are being made by investigating usually the person who made them.
A great example is the current head of the the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen. I have predicted how she is going maneuver current policy and what she is pushing for by reading her husband's research with a 100% accuracy. No magic involved. And I don't even understand the economics behind it, or her or her husband's reasoning!
And I'm absolutely sure they don't either!!! Because it makes no fucking Anyway, sorry for my digression, but I'll tell you anyway. She and her husband have convinced themselves that there is a hard correlation between minimum wage and inflation. And instead of controlling the inflation by in or decreasing the money supply they raise the minimum wage. Which increases unemployment. But at least controls inflation.
So she is a-ok to fuck over a bunch of Americans in order to control inflation. Because unemployment is not a controlled variable in her big experiment. TA-DAH. Now I can argue until my hands fall off with you on how that is A-OK or NAY-OK. But this woman is like three times my age it seems. Much better looking and soft-spoken unlike me. So. We'll just have to fucking stick with her no-solution.
So the straightforward reason is hereby given. The alternative is raising interest rates which will crash/panic Wallstreet. Now I could go give you a straight-ass-forward reason as to why Georgy Herbert needed money for fighting in Guatemala, but you'd say it is a bad reason and it gets us nowhere.
I just suggest they defund the CIA for those particular programs that are retarded. CAN WE HAS NO MORE CONTRAS PLEASE.  Can we agree on fucking just that. CIA let them go back to solely intelligence and let the federal police or the military take care of the rest. Which is something they are currently doing anyway.
No, and I'm no hypocrite either, because I understand you fully. Regardless, a hypocrite usually has a valid point. That is why people don't like 'm. You can concede to the point I'm making without entertaining my world view.
That is rude.
Yes. I agree.
Eh, who cranked out the machinery that won the second world war again?
I don't speak about a moral high ground.
How about stop referring to yourself as a peasant. Members of Congress, your King or Queen or representative maybe shit and piss like the rest of us. The main difference between you and me is that you hold these big institutions to your own standard.
I don't expect the CIA to operate on my watch.
Maybe. But all that abuse of rights got you things like Google (could not have existed under European privacy laws), Apple (Foxconn), NASA (Nazi scientists), IBM (more Nazis), Microsoft (US-centric patent abuse, unfair business practices). I.e.: You can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs.
And I don't share your sterilized worldview where everything outside of the U.S. is so humane and everyone has the best intentions. Actually, it's quite the opposite.
Yea, I'll put that on the list-- right next to the second coming of Jesus.
Yea, if you think that Thomas Paine was nice but he is everything but a popular guy, so forget it. Most of them were slave owners with such ancient antics that I'd have to severely paraphrase them in order not misconstrue their intentions or how they really thought about the world.

I'll bite. True. I just feel to see how that's the underlying cause. After the second WW the US was left with a huge defense industry. Du-uh they want to keep making money so the underlying cause most likely is money and defense contracts. The rest is just icing on the cupcake.
So, all-in-all you're kind of extrapolating here. And from this point on I know that you and I no longer speak the same language. Even though we use the same words, they convey different ideas.
Communism in the the true sense of it's implementation means expropriation... by force. And the way that it happened in Russia, with all it's true communists is that everything effectively belonged to the state. You, in hindsight, can not deny this because it's a stupid fact. Like gravity. That is probably not what you read in Das Kapital.
Regardless of how you feel about this form of government, this scared the shit out of the folks back here because it's Capitalism's antithesis. *disclaimer: I'm pointing stuff out.
Now you might read propaganda from that day  and age, and come to an entirely different conclusion about the severity of this problem. Probably because your definition of communism is very much like that of Marx's Das Kapital. Which in the light of what the USSR effectively did was not that great.
Okay, this is where you fall flat on your face. Americans, however you feel about them, do not identify themselves with their government.*1 So, you don't get to be even close to understand how to make a difference even if you wanted to. Because if they actually took their government serious, things would have been different.
1: You'll find that just about every American represents themselves and the country. This explains all those fricken flags. That is what makes us so loud and obnoxious. Because it's a continuous play of grandstanding, conceding in private... rinse, repeat. So the only thing you'd need to do is provide a viable alternative and wham bam not only will it be embraced, it will become American. That in a nutshell is why I like this country. Less superficial bullshit through the process of self-defeating properties of superficial bullshit.
Like the Borg in Star Trek. But the Borg in this story are actually all hot sociable supermodels in their model cube-Home. That wave flags, eat nice food, have awesome entertainment, and shoot you if you are part of some weirdo hive-mind. They are much nicer then Borg really.
Turning against is such a ridiculous way to explain what is going on. It's called fallen from grace. People are trying to walk away from U.S. Hegemony. And that is fine with me. Foreign governments are relying too much on American military power as I see it. That is why they don't run very fast. If they are running at all.
The only problem with this "logical" conclusion is that, to me, it can go ever which way. If tomorrow people are fed up, they'll change it to whatever. That is also why people in power decided they need secret courts with secret interpretations of secret laws.
The U.S. population is not the U.S. government. And the way you sell it to them they don't want to be either.

Is there an international court that is willing to persecute?
And also because first and foremost the U.S. does not acknowledge The Hague. But the EU does acknowledge US laws. Which is nice.
So, did they pass a resolution or not?

You should stop smoking lettuce. Just because you think something is not a crime does not not make it not a crime. And I don't think 'murdering people for fun' is the USMC charter. It might be your observation but also generally not true for actual marines. And actually not true in any sense. So. There's that.
My logic is not circular you need to look up the words in a dictionary as opposed to just attributing arbitrary definitions to 'm
We're not talking about games so it's probably definition 1 for illegal. A government is self-explanatory and might be construed as morally wrong. But to apply that to any government actually makes nos sense.
And the way you're talking you're probably are an anarchist. Which is also a form of government directed usually by direct democracy.
    illegal
: not allowed by the law : not legal
: not allowed by the rules in a game
    government
noun, gov·ern·ment often attributive \ˈgə-vər(n)-mənt, -və-mənt; ˈgə-bəm-ənt, -vəm-\
: the group of people who control and make decisions for a country, state, etc.
: a particular system used for controlling a country, state, etc.
: the process or manner of controlling a country, state, etc.
  criminal
: involving illegal activity : relating to crime
: relating to laws that describe crimes rather than to laws about a person's rights
: morally wrong
It might be legal, but it's definitely not moral. Which makes it criminal.
You're the inane one here. Juxtaposing random shit, yelling that all governments are criminal enterprises like it means something.
HUMANITY IS A CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE BECAUSE IT'S AGENTS COMMIT CRIMES.
That obviously makes no sense because not all humans are agents that commit crimes.
Neither do all agents of governments commit crimes.

I thought that DynCorp was Blackwater re-branded. But they are something totally different! Revenue in 2010 was 3 billion. Wow. Business must be I wonder what it is that costs 3 billion. From operational income of 120mil in '08 to 3 bil revenue in '10 means what? With 17.000 employees they are about as big as the CIA. So, maybe, if they reserve 2 bil for paying them employees, so they they pay pretty well; around 120k. The rest is write-offs on their 1.5 Bil in equipment. Which takes about three years. Sounds about right. Leaves about 400mil for operations. Basically moving stuff, and acquisitions.
WHAT ARE THEY DOING?
That reminds me of a guy I knew. Big guy. Ex- Blackwater employee. Nice guy. Told me that they go to war because they had too much equipment and bullets and stuff. Inane, right?

It was a rhetorical question; no they did not come up with a binding resolution. That is how the UN enforces policy. Binding resolutions.
So, my point is, what is the point of having international laws that no one is willing to enforce.

I concede to that point.

So, I happen to know a few people that are marines. They don't like killing and are generally very agreeable. Would you like to meet one?
Basically anyone you actually get to meet and say hello to. What do you think they are? Big bad bulky continuously angry men?
Okay, lets try Bakunin, because for a guy who does not no anything about Anarchism I sure know about him. He claims to "organize from below, through local structures interlinked on a federalist basis". I agree with Bakunin on this point. It also happens to be a form of direct Can also be considered to be a government without stretching the term in any way.
Oh, crikey, federalism is a form of government.
Oh fuck, it is mainly used by a horde of anarchist writers :D
Yea, all hail the state. The great provider.
No no, I'm not dishonest. It's just that you're polarizing. You can't find an individual to blame like a proper anarchist. So you blame a group. Like a fucking Nazi.
Well, that's a stretch since, well I can type my fingers raw with anarchist examples of governments, either in literature or in actuality.

Well, it's not necessarily immoral. So not necessarily criminal. Even your own dictionary definition of anarchy provides mentions a government. Albeit a minimal one. Governed you are. Whether it's by consensus, opt-in or otherwise.
? There is lots of that going around amongst humans. How do you suggest people defend themselves against /any /hostile force? Do you think that calling it a militia makes a difference? Having trained defenders of your homestead is no bad thing. It's actually quite smart.
Confusing them with lies and propaganda and making them shoot people that are innocent /is/ repugnant and immoral. But being confused or ignorant is not inherent to the institute . It's something that happens through lack of education and indoctrination through faith institutes (religion). Humans are fallible and on top of that, programmable.
Many of them suffer from a massive, violent even, cognitive dissonance if you talk about what they are actually doing. Once you turn back on the cause and effect part of their humanity it's all tears, anger and confusion. PTSD, shitty coping mechanisms. And you just put them all in a hole, categorizing like a common Nazi.
1*:*  a political theory holding all forms of governmental authority to be unnecessary and undesirable and advocating a society based on voluntary cooperation and free association of individuals and groups
GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY; i.e.: Government as in a society's organizational form, but not it's authority. I.e. Direct Democracy.
Government OR governmental restraint. Government non-the-less. Learn to read you illiterate :D
But yea, I agree that for the sake of the argument they could be considered mutually exclusive. If you want to abolish government. Which is kind of strange because every form of anarchism usually has an adjective regarding it's organization. Federated, syndicalists. All of them are organized in some fashion shape or form.
Now, I don't mind NOT calling that form a form of government. But I don't want to confuse people in to thinking that anarchism is some kind of synonym for chaos.

@_subject: Be alert - signs of Russian invasion may be strong 
References: Russia has taken over Crimea, wreaking havoc on the native Crimean Tatars by upsetting the balance of power in that region. Effectively driving Ukraine into civil war. Crimea, a region that heavily depends on Ukranian utilities and general consumer goods.
It has been a year, and Russia has turned it into a shit hole. There used to be no nuclear weapons on Crimea, now there will be. The minorities were free to express their religion, now they have express their religion under government oversight or pay fines-- and in most cases both since as anyone who ever did to do business in Russia knows that it corrupt as fuck.
The Russian government initially made good on promises to hike doctors’ and teachers’ salaries after the annexation, but those raises were cut back in April.
Since January prices for food have risen over 19%, almost twice as steeply as in Russia. Among those who opposed the annexation some want Ukraine to impose a total blockade. The rationale for this is to have “Putin try to deliver it all”.
The peninsula’s main industry, tourism, is, as we all know, is left completely fucked. The ferry service from Russia’s mainland brings nothing like enough tourists to make up for the absent Ukrainians and the Europeans whose cruise ships once docked in Yalta.
Western credit cards do not work.
Many businesses have been expropriated by “self-defence” units, paramilitaries controlled by the peninsula’s Russian-installed prime minister, Sergei Aksyonov.
Meanwhile again, the fucking “authorities” are eliminating the political and cultural space for Crimea’s Tatars and ethnic Ukrainians. Cool right? Go Russia.
In March a group of Ukrainians who laid flowers at a statue of Taras Shevchenko, their national poet, were fined some $200 each for “employing Ukrainian attributes”. Which is not at all unlike KGB tactics where they jail journalists for three days. Kick 'm around hold a gun to their head. Oh shit this already happens. Google "Crimea voting fraud" for a dozen examples.
The Irony of the “Crimea Is Ours!” slogan:  well researched for your comic relief. Because in Russian Federation occupied territory even basic infrastructure like a busted sewer-pipe won't be Last month, authorities detained seven Ukrainians for taking selfies while wearing /vyshyvanki/, their traditional embroidered shirts.
Police also detained a dozen Tatars who gathered in Simferopol’s Lenin Square on May 18th to commemorate Deportation Day, the anniversary of the date in 1944 when Stalin deported all 180,000 Crimean Tatars to central Asia.
Meanwhile Russia 85% of Crimea’s budget is now supplied by Russia’s federal government. In April Dmitri Medvedev, Russia’s prime minister, put the overall costs incurred due to the annexation (including the cost of sanctions) at $27 billion in 2014 alone.
Russian citizens may grow less happy about bearing such costs as time goes on. An opinion poll in May found only 16% of Russians would support budget cuts in Russia proper in favor of developing Crimea. But after the propaganda commitment Mr Putin has made, it would be politically inconceivable to roll back the annexation.
These numbers are the official ones from Moscow, Google Natalia Zubarevich who is a Russian economist at Moscow University if you'd like to know more about how Putin fucks over his own population for the benefit of his own fucking ego.
On 19 June 2015, the Council extended the EU restrictive measures in response to the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol until 23 June 2016. The sanctions include prohibitions on:
- imports of products originating in Crimea or Sevastopol into the EU;
- investment in Crimea or Sevastopol, meaning that no Europeans nor EU-based companies can buy real estate or entities in Crimea, finance Crimean companies or supply related services;
- tourism services in Crimea or Sevastopol, in particular, European cruise ships cannot call at ports in the Crimean peninsula, except in case of emergency;
- exports of certain goods and technologies to Crimean companies or for use in Crimea in the transport, telecommunications and energy sectors and related to the prospection, exploration and production of oil, gas and mineral resources. Technical assistance, brokering, construction or engineering services related to infrastructure in these sectors must not be provided either.
As stated by the European Council on 19 March 2015, the EU continues to condemn the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol by the Russian Federation and remain committed to fully implement its non-recognition So, Putin just created an economically isolated economic dead-zone with 2.4 million people. And this is something that EVERY FUCKING ONE knew ahead of time. So there is a reason he's dicking around on Ukraine's border. He NEEDS to annex at least the east of Ukraine. Or lose face regarding Crimea because he is going to feel the pressure internally supporting an economic dead zone. 2.4 million mouths to feed with no place to go.
So, yea, Russia invades. And they do this without regard for the population they are invading.
Whenever I read such an exceptionally retarded opinion piece... I suggest you go troll someone else with it.  Again EVERY FUCKING ONE KNEW that Crimea is an island and that it will be hard to supply. Especially since it is almost completely dependent on Ukraine to power it's economy.
Also the referendum oh my fucking god. Russian Invasion > Russian Referendum > Russian Troops overseeing said referendum > turnout bigger then 100% > like 95%+ victory.
Yea right.
Also, the Russians shot down a commercial flight.

Here, conventional fool-proof armchair analyses of Russia's sad attempt to to cover it up. Anyway, forensic analyses is still under way. We'll know what happened eventually.
Full report  proving without reasonable doubt that the Russian version of the story is made up. The image verification narrowed it down to Photoshop version they used to cook the evidence with.
There are over a million supporting images, video and documents that support the claim that it was in fact  a Russian BUK SAM-launcher system.
The supporting evidence is so thorough, complete with the identity of the supporting logistics brigade. Complete with selfies from Vkontakte, the Russian facebook. So yea, even the Russians are apparently very much aware of what they did. The service men are obviously dumb enough to blog about it.

Well, I guess Juan's rhetorical question is voicing my concern that crazy-people political rants are not what I sought when I subscribed to this mailing list.
Stop talking in blanket terms as 'propaganda' please, have you seen what ISIS PR came up with for this summer? Maybe Zenaan can cry next about their border inviolability next
Maybe you'll get inspired by people being shot in a car with an RPG, or the explosive necklace or drowning in a cage. Fun Fun Fun.
You can discuss the nature of western governments all you like. As long as an argument is well put together I and others will listen and won't even complain. Zenaan's stuff is neither.
Well, and in addition of bringing things to the table that are way out of bounds, I also happen to disagree with just everything that Zenaan has to say.
Zenaan not believe Russians are operating in the Ukraine.
Zenaan conflates ethnic cleansing of an ethnic minority with international politics.
Zenaan is tremendously biased towards a lot of issues.

Blatantly anti-American (rhetoric only, if you'd ever find yourself living here you'd find yourself a lot less radical and carry yourself a bit more You are very sensitive on the subject of being run over by a foreign power indicates a permanent identity crisis (Argentine) as to where you fit in the world of things.
Your over-sized ego i.e. taking things personally that are actually a general remark is quite a cultural trait. So is calling people by name instead of addressing the issue.

I read the motorcycle diaries-- and loved it. I have not read Lysander.
I squarely base my assumptions on you being incongruous. And I'll have you know-- every man is a sum of it's experiences. So I can tell quite reliable where people are from. You are, if only partly, a product of your own government.
Maybe. But I'm pleased I was right. I wasn't sure I was right. Again, incongruancies (has a red squiggly I don't know how to spell it). Everyone talks shit non-sequitur. It triggers something in my brain (anger mostly) and I sort people by who they are based on that. It is one of my things.
Not necessarily true. You'd be surprised which people I consider functionally illiterate (not in the actual meaning, but diminished ability to convey information in writing etc.). Usually conflict areas are great places to look for people who can actually put two and two together and subsequently rely on language to convey critical information that is generally more particular and less generic. Which develops certain language skills. So far, the best all-round experience I had concerning people and their functional literacy: Albania, Finland, South Africa, Denmark, UAE, South South America. Great experience with Afghan refugees. Just to name a few. The Swiss. Singaporeans. But overall not mainland Europeans.
Mainland Europeans are over all a hit or miss. In Spain just about no one speaks proper English.
The average European. Even though they have a rudimentary understanding of the English language a lot of them can't formulate a sentence to save their life. They rarely have any deeper understanding of idiom BECAUSE it resembles their own language. Also they fuck up the prepositions.
No. You're a disgruntled individual. You work for yourself.
Cypherpunk-ness for me comes mainly in the form of using crypto so secure my data and the information of others. Good examples are, I can run a VPN to access my documents remotely-- but I could also use sftp. Which is easier to implement? Arguably SFTP. Added bonus is that my RSA certificates can be used to auth for both implementations.
I encrypt client data with my public PGP key on a public server. Prefer the KISS model to cyber security rather then adding layers. VLAN? retarded. VPN? retarded (most use cases). Why do we (I) use these tools? Because the attacker, in my case, which usually comes from overseas are individuals looking for stuff to break into. CC numbers. That sort of And most of my problems originate from India and China. Not that that is a reliable statement since we all know that the perp can be in Djibouti for all we know. But not very likely because most people don't care that much for OPSEC. They are not governments. 404s on my server: 70-80% originates from India/China. Port scans are almost all from India.
And what really grinds my gears is that with shit standards like PCI compliance most payment gateways in the U.S. are 100% open.
EXAMPLE: if I use my CC in a particular mall at a particular store, one month from now I get a call from the bank and have multiple $1 test charges of people guessing my CVC code. It had to happen 5 times before I could connect the dots. And it's all foreign malicious attacks. No We need crypto to get in there and secure my transactions. Regardless if you think that CC companies are the square root of all evil.

@_subject: [HunchLab] Predicting Crime in Miami 
This is how it's pitched to the community:
FTA: The Miami police currently is using COMPSTAT, which does not predict where crime will happen insofar it tells you where it has been taking place. In addition they will start using HunchLab at some point.
An associate professor from Florida International University, Rob T. Guerette is expected to become their local expert on this piece of software. The person who wrote the grant for it is Lt. Sean MacDonald.
The article claims that similar software has "... helped prevent and stop property crimes, and is now being tested on gun crimes."
Which makes me curious as about the kind of heuristics that they are using.
HunchLab apparently produces maps showing small areas where specific crimes are likely to be committed.
This is not a new turn of events, as Miami-Dade’s robbery division uses IBM's Blue PALMS to solve cold cases. The software connects to a database of every crime ever documented by Miami-Dade police. Detectives enter the details of an unsolved crime and the program produces a list of 20 suspects.
Now the part of the Nuevo Herald's article that cough my attention is the moment that it starts speculating about it's effectiveness.
The last few sentences juxtapose the potential volatility of it's predictions with who is responsible for it's "effectiveness".
HunchLab uses a wider dataset than the rough equivalent PredPol. Annotated with the official final statement that the tool will only be "...as good as the officers using it."
Putting the burden of proof of it's effectiveness squarely on the shoulders of the officers forced to use it. Which is, in my opinion, ridiculous. Since the software is supposed to predict the crime and not the other way around.
I highly suspect that it grabs a bunch of data, normalizes it for the use with a map and starts looking for some correlation coefficient and then looks if it's statistically significant. I.e. it's a null hypothesis-- exactly what Larry Samuels, CEO of PredPol tries to warn them about expecting weird results. Since that is exactly what you get when you grow your dataset and statistically analyze the date using correlation coefficients + phi.
Anyway. Who build this software? And what does it do?
