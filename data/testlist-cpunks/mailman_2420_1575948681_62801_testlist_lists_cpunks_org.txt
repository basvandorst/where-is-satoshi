Suppose you are a domestic terrorist because you have made noises,
written newspapers, put Ron Paul stickers on your bumper, you are an
Oath Keeper," a member of JPFO, ad-nauseum:
Now suppose your house has been located by one of the 170,000 people
working for the census and coordinates given to your front door:
Now suppose some problems break out in your area between angry
citizens and our Mother Culture.imagine that somewhere out there
a pilot is typing your name into his plane or choppers computer, the
one that controls Precision-guided munitions (PGMs, smart munitions,
smart bombs, guided bomb units or GBUs) you know, the ones being
perfected over in the Mid-Eastyour name and coordinates are set:
Better yet, maybe the pilot just flies, and someone in Homeland
Security at some darkened monitor somewhere types your name.heres
what happens:
Id suggest activists might want to leave their homes for a while should
disagreements break out between the Mother Culture and her charges.
Lets listen to Ben Franklin a moment, should you wonder if our
is capable of this stuff: Never trust a government that doesn't trust
citizens with guns. Then ask yourself: Does your government trust you,
does it seem just a little paranoid?
This is rather bizarre....target on your back? Nope....heh....target on
front door...
