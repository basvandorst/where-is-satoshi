@_subject: [p2p-hackers] Privacy issues with P2P protocols 
I would like to point you to a recent work we made that we believe
might be of interest to the BitTorrent/P2P community.
In this work that was presented at IMC'11, we show what we believe
to be a significant privacy issue for most P2P protocols.
-We show that leveraging on Skype, we can map a social identity (name,
age, location, email address, etc.) to an IP address fully
inconspicuously. This attack works for all (500M) Skype users. This is
severe as an attacker does not need the ISP support (that an
individual cannot usually get) to retrieve the social identity linked
to an IP address.
-We show that we can then follow the mobility of a Skype user, and we
 found that we can indeed observe real mobility patterns for a large
 fraction of Skype users.
-Finally, we were able to link a Skype identity to a list of
 BitTorrent downloads even if the user is behind a NAT or a proxy (we
 use the predictability of the IP-ID in IP headers to make sure that
 two different applications are running on the same host).
That attack described uses Skype, but would also work with several
other popular VoIP systems.
