In all those cases, the critics were right.  You just think "imminent"
means "in the next year or two".  Look at at the signs, man --
literacy and child mortality rates, an imprisoned populace, massive government debt, etc.  The US is slipping into the second world as we
speak, with no signs of a turnaround ahead.  Only the sheer size of
the economy keeps people from believing it.  The critics _were_ right.
(Incidentally, the race issue certainly spans more than a mere
decade. The race-related violent demonstrations certainly peaked in
the 60s, but the deleterious effects of forced immigration and slavery
have been a blight on society every day for almost three centuries.) Go right ahead, fed, ban strong crypto.  The coffin only needs a few
more nails.
