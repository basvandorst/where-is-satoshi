"Just wanted to thank you for all your help in getting the Lincoln
Center for the Performing Arts web site up and running.  Cyber Media
has been prompt - handling all calls and e-mails within 24 hours, and
going above and beyond the call of duty to be sure everything was
working properly. The staff has been extremely courteous, knowledgable
and professional.  We look forward to a mutually and prosperous
business relationship!"

"Since I've been with Cyber Media, I have gone from playing with
the Internet with inadequate tools, to actually working with the
proper tools provided by Cyber Media (Shopping cart, autoresponders,
email addresses, and faster servers).  I have also noticed that the
speed of their servers is much faster and the quality of the support
improved immensely.  I used to be with Webcom and could never reach
anyone on the phone, and rarely had my calls returned.  I was raised
in an era where customer support was important, it is to me, and you
are the first company I've worked with on the Internet who has not
only met my expectations but totally surpassed them!  Thank you

"I have been with Cyber Media for the last 3 years and they have
always been there when I've had a question, and have quickly resolved
any problems that I have had.  I constantly recommend them to my
customers and would be happy to talk to anyone who is skeptical.  Give
me a call at 912-475-4682."
