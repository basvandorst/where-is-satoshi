I found an interesting "mount a container as a drive letter"
encryption program in finland called "BestCrypt NP", when I was first
looking for a program like you describe.  It's available for 3
environments currently, those being:  Dos, Windows 95, and Windows NT.
It has three algorithms that you can pick from for encryption:
GOST28147-89 (32 rounds, 256 bits primary key, 512 bits secondary key)
Blowfish (in Cipher Block Chaining Mode with 256-bit key length and 16
I use Blowfish and GOST (depending on the size of the container I'm
working with), and avoided DES, even before Deep Crack was invented. You can check out the product for yourself at:
I've been using the product for several months, and am rather pleased
with it.  I now keep my email, inbound attachments, netscape user
directory (including cache), scanned financial records, and PGP
private/public keyrings in this product's encrypted container files.
I've had the opportunity to test the company's support via email, and
I've been pleased with that as well.  The gentleman who appears to be
running the show is "Oleg Essine".
I'm looking at CFS (Cryptographic File System) for when I make the
jump away from Microsoft towards S.u.S.E. Linux 5.2.
