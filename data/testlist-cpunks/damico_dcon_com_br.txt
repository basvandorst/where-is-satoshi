I think, that one important and simple tool that will remain useful for
the next decades is Analog Audio Encryption.
Radio & Analog communications are simple to implement and very useful
for good and for bad, but I think that what will keep this technology
live for situations, like wars, conflicts, protests etc, will be the use
of Audio Encryption over Radio & Analog communications.

@_subject: dm-crypt+LUKS 
Hey people,
Could you give me your impressions about the use (only in Linux) of
dm-crypt + LUKS instead of truecrypt?
For me there is no need to use my encrypted disks with OSX or Windows,
so, due the last movements of truecrypt, I am planning to move my
encrypted disks from truecrypt to dm-crypt + LUKS.
Did you see is as a bad decision, in terms of possible flaws in dm-crypt?
Best Regards

@_subject: Ars Thecnica TrueCrypt Disinformation Article ??? 
This article from Ars Following TrueCrypt’s bombshell advisory, developer says fork is TrueCrypt developer withholds permission, suggests "starting from scratch."
Seems to be a text inserted by some Intelligence Agency, as part of a disinformation agenda, with the aim of sowing fear in those who has interest in fork TrueCrypt.
For me, there are no real facts demonstrated in the article. Also at end of the day, some organization or institution must claim the ownership of truecrypt in order to protect its interests over the source code.
Am I right? What do you think?

@_subject: ### Two Open Source Apps for data protection ### 
Hi All,
I've developed 2 small/simple/open-source Android apps that can be
useful for data protection in mobile devices:
Yapea: Yet Another Picture Encryption Application
SecNote: Encrypted Notepad for Android
Both applications, has these features:
  * Encryption Algorithms:
        Symetric encryption:
        AES (CBC/PKCS5Padding)
        Blowfish (CFB/NoPadding)
        The Initialization Vectors are generated based on unique data
        from the smartphone.
  * Type of encryption key:
        Length: 256 bits
        Generated through key derivation (from user-defined password)
        with PBKF2 algorithm. The salt are generated based on unique
        data from the smartphone. The key is stored inside a
        configuration file, at smartphone file system. This file is used
        for password verification at first time of application use.
        After that the key is encripted and stored inside smartphone
        memory (cache). But at anytime the user can choose to delete the
        encrypted key from memory (Clear cache).
  * Application reset: At anytime the user can choose to dump ALL
    application data, including encrypted images and configuration.
  * Panic password: A password that can be used to delete all encrypted
    images. In a case where user is forced to give its key. (If you're
    traveling overseas, across borders or anywhere you're afraid your
    smartphone might be tampered with or examined).
  * Languages: English and Portuguese
Best Regards,
