Imagine Ashcroft as Chief Justice.
I really hope I'm wrong.
What happens when the Chief Justice is dead?  Can someone close to him
(like his secretary) pull the strings on his corpose and "send in" his
votes indefinitely, without his being in attendance during the
conferences, receiving case briefs from his law clerks, or attending
oral arguments?
