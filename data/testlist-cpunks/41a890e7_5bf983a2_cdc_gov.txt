Standardized education. We can't have anyone teaching to the 50th
percentile, even assuming the median teen-citizen can handle basic
calculus and E&M.  Teachers must teach one or two sigmas below that
level, and anyone who gets hyperactive in such an inane educational
environment is malfunctioning and requires medication.
There has always been an uneducated class. These days, its members can
be found in gangs, sitting at home watching TV and drinking beer, or
hanging out on slashdot writing open-source software.
