   [1]securitas writes "The [2]Department of Defense has launched Phase I
   of its delayed IPv6 interoperability test ([3]mirror) in a six-month
   project dubbed [4]Moonv6. It is the [5]largest North American IPv6
   test ever and its goal is to evaluate IPv6 for 'network-centric
   military operations.' Phase II was originally scheduled to begin in
   January 2004 but may be delayed due to the late start of the current
   test. 'IPv4 addresses are 32 bits long, enough for around 4 billion
   unique addresses.' In contrast, the IPv6 address length is '128 bits,
   or 340 billion billion billion billion unique addresses.' Experts hope
   this will solve a predicted IP address shortage as more devices are
   created to use the Internet."
