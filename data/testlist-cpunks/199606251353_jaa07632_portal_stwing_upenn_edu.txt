@_subject: domain names / f-secure.. 
even that was questionable, there were a rash of copyright infringements a couple of years ago.. the legal holders of the names that were taken had to go to great lengths to get the name, and sometimes could not.. i'm sure you've heard of the toys-r-us vs. roadkill-r-us domain dispute, and how microsoft.com finally `persuaded' micros0ft.com to give it up..
at any rate - has anyone tried out that new f-secure by the folks who brought us f-prot? "military strength internet encryption".. seems to be an encrypted telnet, but i can't replace our server to test it..
