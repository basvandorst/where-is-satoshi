@_subject: [Geowanking] E911 // cellular trilateration accuracy 
At the risk of asking (another) obvious question, I continue my naove streak
on this listserv
Ive heard very different reports of how accurate cellphone tracking isthe
FAA mandates something like 50% of calls must be traceable to within a range
of 30m but Ive heard some mobile pros say theyve heard of it getting as
good as several feet. Obviously this varies depending on geography (urban,
rural, topography), but does anybody have any idea how the US wireless
carriers stack up? And how does this compare to phones with GPS?
