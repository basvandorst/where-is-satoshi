Can anyone tell me whether Ian Goldberg and David Wagner got their $25,000
from Netscape for finding the HUGE security flaws in Netscape's existing product line??
I can't remember whether they got anything or not ...
(Sorry, but I've been away from the list.  One of those, "fate of the Free World hangs in the balance" thingies ... ;-)
Have Netscape and AT&T shown some holiday goodwill, or are they still engaged in their felonious freeloading foolishness?
Alice de 'nonymous ...                                                 ...just another one of those...
