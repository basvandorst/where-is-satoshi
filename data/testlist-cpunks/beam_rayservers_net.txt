@_subject: Google can grow up to not be evil 
"By working together with those that harvest value from nature, Google
can quickly create a truly non-evil system for all.
We suggest that the “there is one way and that way is secure,
economically-viable-and-self-extending, anonymous and untraceable” is
the policy to adopt, in that order.
We are happy to amplify this."

IMHO there is no point to blame one entity or one electronic payment
system for online transactions when the international bank/finance
regulations (acts, bills, laws, legislations) encourage/force data
collection/merging/profiling/sharing everywhere all the time.
But you point in the right direction to an old topic on the cpunk list.
To begin, at the beginning: *financial privacy issues*
The good news is the emergence of new fintech based on new financial
cryptography systems which will ensure financial privacy.

John posted the following link:
See *saluations*
Without a *t*
My little joke was not to your liking I guess.
Add a *t* between *u* and *a*
You will get the right link.

My first impressions it is hosted on amazon...
My questions:
How is it secure?
How the pubkey is transfered?
Is it encrypted from server to client?
How do you manage MiTM?
I am sorry to play the devil advocate here but at the moment, this is a
true LoT => Lack of TRUST
Please secure your infrastructure, secure your servers until you are
able to provide a secure openpgp keyserver service and a secure
encryption message service.
Yes ;)
Please stop spreading invitations.
