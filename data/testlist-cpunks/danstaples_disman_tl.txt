Not so sure we need to be quite so cynical. Obviously this encryption is useless against state-level agencies, since data is encrypted server-side and Google manages the keys ( although the fact that they think they won't be obligated to hand the keys over to the gov't is bullshit). However, what I think is important to see in this story, is that Google is responding to pressure from the public to take privacy and encryption more seriously. This is an opportunity for security and privacy activists to push for real security solutions for user data storage, that involve strong *client-side encryption* of data.

This morning's NSA article from WaPo contains some slides mentioning
USRP equipment[1]. It's hard to say without more context whether it's
referring to the GSM equipment from Ettus...anyone care to speculate?
The USRP series doesn't exactly seem like carrier-grade equipment, but
perhaps the NSA has a good reason to use it. Maybe baseband
exploitation, as coderman has previously mentioned? Simply getting cell
tower database dumps from the telcos would suffice for location info, so
I would guess this has a different purpose.

References: It's even more absurd considering the inevitable progress of technology
over the next 10 years of Hammond's sentence. If we do our jobs right,
everything will be using encryption by then. This could have the effect
of simply barring him from using any sort of communicative digital
technology...making many everyday tasks impossible.
The only exception in the sentence is his use of encryption as required
by employment. But it's hard enough for ex-felons to find a job after
getting released as it is...

I hope you realize I was making a point about the challenges of
ex-felons in general, and not making a judgment on Hammond. He is
obviously brilliant and courageous, and many activists with the
ability to hire employees would be more than willing to help and
employ him when he gets out...
Witnessing his sentencing yesterday was physically sickening, and
definitely the worst abuse of our "justice" system I've ever seen. I
can only hope it inspires, rather than intimidates, other activists
and hackers to continue the type of work that he did.

I would be interested to see the details of the exploits you
witnessed/were subject to (especially since I was at DC20). How exactly
did you determine how the exploits occurred, and who was responsible for
them? How are you certain the DC19 attacks utilized DRT tech?

References: <2780551.exnjNUlKQP
Why did they use Paypal? Probably because they are aspiring to gain
popular attention and support, and most people don't use Bitcoin; they
use Paypal and credit cards for online transactions.
Of course Paypal is a liability in terms of privacy and the risks of
them doing something just like what they did, but if MailPile hadn't
gone with Paypal, it's likely they wouldn't have gotten the amount of
funding that was donated so far. It's always a tradeoff of risk,
especially when you're aiming to go mainstream.

anonymity, especially when facing a state-level adversary. It's the
