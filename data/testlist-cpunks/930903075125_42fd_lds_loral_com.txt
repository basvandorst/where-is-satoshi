I also have a copy of this.
I have.  Pretty effective stuff, although I don't think it mentions
the old "ammonium nitrate + motor oil" standby.  ;)
I got mine at the Dallas Gun Show several years ago, along with "Survival,
Evasion, and Escape".
I don't see why not - after all, alt.pyrotechnics has a lot of discussion
of this sort of thing...
