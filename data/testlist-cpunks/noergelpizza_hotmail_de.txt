For the case of Border guards that want to have a look at your data
there's an article from schneier:
You can also use a normal (fake | Windows) OS on your standart HDD and a
hidden OS on a mSATA SSD, you can use a 16 GB disk with a small and
encryted Ubuntu distribution. If you set the boot standart to your
standart HDD then you have a good chance to get through the control.
Another possibility is to combine this with a hidden truecrypt
container, no one can force you to write down a password to a container
that is probably not even existing. You can't prove that.
If this is to complicated for you, you can still install a OS on a small
USB stick. Or a SDHC card. It's not that expensive and if you have an
USB stick fixed at your keyring I think no one will notice.
The most secure thing would be a Live CD and a hidden container on an
USB / SDHC device. So they can't infiltrate a system that is not even
installed (backtrack and stuff have truecrypt onboard) and they can't
force you to open that hidden container (because you only know if there
is a container when you hit the right password.
When nobody performs a hardware hack on your SATA or something then
nothing can happen. If they keep your notebook for some minutes | hours
It's also helpful to check the md5 checksum of the boot partition; you
can have a virus / keylogger in there.
