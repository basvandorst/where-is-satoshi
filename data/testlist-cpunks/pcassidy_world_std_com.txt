@_subject: All about Bernstein 
I'm the guy who authored an upcoming piece about Bernstein's law suit with the state department for WIRED. WIRED loves the piece but, in the style of popular mags, wants more personal stuff on Bernstein, who is super articulate about the science and law of crypto but super shy about his heroic self. (Guy wouldn't even disclose his age! Had to threaten to throw myself in front of a bus to get him to tell me he's from Long Island!) Editor thinks guy comes across as a ghost, not surpisingly. . .
One fellow from the list, following up an appeal I made here for Friends
of Bernstein to call me and tell me about the litigant's best qualities,
I'd appreciate greatly hearing from again. He called when I'd pretty much passed deadline for manuscript delivery. I'm calling Dan again, but after one trip to Delphi, I dunno if the responses from the Oracle will be any more forthcoming.
Thanks and regards to all,
Peter Cassidy

Sorry, folks, I thought I'd cc:ed this to the list.

I agree. Some editors refuse to let actors be engaged as professionals
only. My philosophy is people's stories are their own and they are in
control of them to the extent they inform these stories. WIRED likes to
find crusaders and campaigners for their profiles. Sometimes they're not
the swashbuckling types that make for engaging personality pieces. That's
why I went for the issues around ITAR and a speculation on the case's
merits in relative case law and the judicial environment it will enter. DJB got eloquent where I thought it was important in terms of the
technology and research running up against a law that is itself full of
negotiable loopholes, quiet on everything else. Most everyone who's met
him tells me he's really retiring. Which lead me to conclude the guy might
have the kind of reserve and restraint required for protracted litigation
with the government which is essentially becomes an endurance contest.
Now, saying that, is it weird to think that people would be interested in
a fellow like that? Wrong?
charities frauds, etc. and even when I'm writing about gangsters, personal
detail isn't used for "spice" as much as it is narrative coherence. Who
introduced the arsonist to the drug dealer to do the condo deal? Is that
gossip or an essential detail? In science writing the personal detail
illuminates sometimes, not always, the actors involved in great discovery.
Is it prying to learn that Maslow felt better after he married his goofy
fourth cousin and came up with theory of the heirarchy of needs? No, but
it makes the story of the science more resonant. That's not a bad thing.
the states which is why I gravitate toward the analytic or investigative publications like the Economist, Covert Action Quarterly or the Texas Observer, The Progressive and good trades like CIO. Yet even in these publications, the examination of protagonists is not considered out of bounds. I think it's not in your interest to be sniffing at the press. Tell them exactly what you wrote here and take these guys for a ride. Freeh has managed to make himself out to be this tower of virtue and civil leadership  -  well, up until recently and, you'll remember, led a successful charge for passage of the digital telephony bill which will be the model for crypto legislation, at least in terms of lobby tactics if not language. He did this partly by force of personality and his credibility. He didn't gain these by being precious about himself or his enterprise or, finally, by being a good cop or jurist. He did it with great PR and  a sense of how the press works, not by wingeing when an interview opportunity came around. -	Levy, if anything, is doing all cryptodom a favor if average schmucks pick up his book and say, gosh, is *that* what is at stake here? His NYT piece was clear and straightforward - engaged the science of crypto seriously and at the level of the reader could handle - and made the protagonists and antogonists accessible. Right now, crypto is not even on the map. Creating a barricade around the people that are driving this defining technology does no one any good. In fact, when it comes down to the end-game, legislating a ban on non-escrowed crypto, the first thing the Justice department will do is characterize you guys as amoral eggheads who are building technologies to hide the crimes of terrorists, rapists, genocidists and maniacs. At that point, I should think you would like to be appreciated as scientists with principles you act on in daily life and in your work, gosh, even personal philosophies, real personal stuff like that.

@_subject: Bernstein! Where are YOU! 
Friends - and Bernstein,
-	I am a writer on assignment from the Economist writing about a certain cryptographers' tussle with the State Department, a fellow who is known around the beltway crypto-anarchy, privacy, niceness-on-the-Internet advocacy crowds as Bernstein. I have the outline of the case from the attorney's handling it. But my editors would really like to be able to name the party and sketch his background. All I have now is a last name, that he is a professor/and/or graduate student at UC Berkeley and is being roughed up by the State Department. Can anyone here - or the hero of the hour himself - come forward and help me complete my -					Regards,

-	PS: By the way, thanks to the guys who helped me shore up some basic concepts for the pieces I've done for OMNI and the Covert Action Quarterly that have touched on cryptography. Weirdly, one editor actually knew the fellow from Texas that I'd interviewed on technical points. (They worked together on a newspaper. What a ruck!)

@_subject: What *is* the power of the FIPS 
-	My editor from the Covert Action Quarterly called with a question on a piece I've authored on the NSA's involvement in the development of the digital telephony bill. I animated the characters and campaign strategies in this narrative common to the clipper and DT initiatives. In that, taking about Clipper I mentioned its rise as a FIPS, etc. -	QUESTION: Just what is the power of the FIPS outside of the interop issues in sending stuff back and forth from federal agencies?

@_subject: exponential relationship of crytographer and cryptanalyst 
-	I'm writing a piece on the politics of surveillance/privacy technologies for OMNI, essentially a survey of their advance since the 1967 proposal for the National Data Center. I cover cryptography, deriving the narrative from Clipper Chip initiative. The point I'm trying to make is that given the market forces pushing commerce onto the public networks and the increasing power of available encryption, the cold war national apparatus will have to mobilize quickly a la digital telephony to stomp it - yet the nature of computing puts them in a loosing position in the long run. Toward the latter part of this thesis, I've been told - and want check with youz - of the exponential relationship of crytographer and cryptanalyst. The heart of this relationship has been explained to me as follows: Increasing the key by one bit effectively doubles the number of keys and proportionally increases the power required to break it in a brute force attack. Is this true? Is there a truer way of stating it? Are there complicating factors this excludes that I should discuss?

wired has balls. the economist has to figure out what all this stuff means in the real world. wired just sells ads around the events it covers. lewis is innocent compared to wanton scum like kelly.

outside of a lot of traditional metrics and hard to authenticate even if
it were simple to measure. Forrester sites 250 million retail and $90
million in content revenues. By contrast, guys selling a piece of pipe
raked in $1.5 billion. Activmedia -  - does regular surveys. I just got a breathless press release for their latest one - "WEB COMMERCE UP 1900%." Someone must have bought tickets the lastest George Forman comeback fight or something from a ticketron on-line kiosk. . .

It's probably going to be continued. Civil suits involving the government six months just to engage - that is schedule them and get all the preliminary motions out of the way.

The article failes to point out that this system - actually one much larger in scope already exists as Treasury's FINCEN system, headed by a former Army AI expert. FINCEN sifts all the bank transfer manifests and, last I looked, had stuck tentacles into other agency's databases to further collate and refine its focus - now toward locating potential targets.  FINCEN was only supposed to be marshalled for Justice Department investigations of suspected money laundering. Next, it'll be used to auto-author warrants and indictments. . .

Don't flame me for asking. It's just that in following this guy I cannot
get very close to those who have met with the crypto czar - except in
Japaan where sources have gotten me pretty close to the man's activities.
. . I'm trying to finish up the research for a piece on Aaron who has been
meeeting with Western Allies to get them on-board the key escrow program
that the Clinton Administration has mindelessly pursued since the first
week of its reign. Aaron has been all over, visiting UK, Japan and Germany and Australia -
meeting different kinds of receptions, most visibly successful in Japan. All I am asking here is if anyone has contacts at important labs or
government ministries where Aaron might have been received. I've got to
have my ducks lined up before I interview him.
