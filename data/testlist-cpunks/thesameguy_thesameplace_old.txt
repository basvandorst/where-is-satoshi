* A Washington Post report in March on prison corruption in
Mexico revealed that drug traffickers supposedly under maximum
security actually have "spacious rooms, cooks and maids, cellular
phones, a gymnasium, a sauna, and manicured gardens where they

typically issued memos and gave orders by cellular phone while
wearing $400 alligator boots and eating specially prepared food in
his cell. To read these News of the Weird newspaper
