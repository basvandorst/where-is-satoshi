Is is possible to regulate the Internet?  You bet, but not in any
productive, useful way.  You want to regulate the Internet?  Just go to

the capacity to evolve, develop, and innovate the way the Internet does.
Encryption controls are a great example of the futility of attempting to
"regulate" the net.  As Adam Back delights in showing, you can write
powerful crypto in tiny little hacks of maybe 130 characters or so in perl.

length.  Who are the feds kidding when they think that they can "stop"
people from doing this?
