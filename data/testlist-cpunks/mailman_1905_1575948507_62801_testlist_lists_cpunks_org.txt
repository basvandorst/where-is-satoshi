        URL:        The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is susceptible to brute-force
attacks, which are well within the reach of a modestly financed
adversary.  As a result, DES has been deprecated, and replaced by the
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).  Nonetheless, many applications
continue to rely on DES for security, and designers and implementers
continue to support it in new applications.  While this is not always
inappropriate, it frequently is.  This note discusses DES security
implications in detail, so that designers and implementers have all
the information they need to make judicious decisions regarding its
use.  This memo provides information for the Internet community.
