BEIJING (AP) _ China is planning measures to stop obscene or
harmful material from entering the country via the Internet, its
official news agency reported Sunday.
           The Communist Party and the State Council, China's cabinet,
recently ordered such measures after learning that ``pornographic
and detrimental information'' had been disseminated electronically
in China, the Xinhua News Agency said.
           The report said China intended to use the Internet to promote
the exchange and transfer of technology and scientific information,
while at the same time blocking what it sees as negative
           It did not provide further details.
