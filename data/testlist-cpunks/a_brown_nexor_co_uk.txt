... well almost.  It's trivial to write a program that extracts the LSB's from a GIF file and then determine their randomness.  Truly random data gives away the presence of an encrypted file. The solution is to choose the LSB's that you alter according to the output from a decent random number generator so that each LSB has a probability of being altered.

@_subject: Steganography (Was Re: What kind of encryption to incorporate?) 
I've seen it. I'm the guy that wrote s-tools (available from ftp.dsi.unimi.it).  My package will hide files in GIFs, BMPs and WAVs, using the probabalistic method that I described, and using decent (but damn slow) quantization to reduce the original colour resolution.  Built-in encryption methods are IDEA, DES, 3DES, MPJ2 (128, 256, 384, 512 bit keys)
and NSEA.  Operating modes are selectable from ECB, CBB, CFB, OFB and PCBC. If you are going to download it, make sure you get version 2.
I'm currently on the look out for new steganography ideas (you might have seen the patches I wrote that allow files to be hidden in gzip compressed files). I thought of a load of obvious stuff like adding/not adding spaces at the end of lines of a text file, carefully choosing assembler instructions where two are available, etc. Has anyone got any more ideas?

I've already done that, it's included in the s-tools v2 package as a module to conceal information in .WAV files.
The effect on quality when using the LSB of an 8 bit 11Khz mono sample is not noticeable unless the original sound is highly pure (e.g. downloaded from a synth). Even then it only shows up as _very_ faint interference that needs a good hi-fi to hear and the original sample for comparison.

I was particularly pleased with myself when these worked, since it demonstrates that you don't need sampled data in order to hide information.

Can't see any reason why not.  The PGP code is freely redistributable,
it's what the recipients do with the patented parts of it that will matter.
e.g. use of the IDEA code in a commercial environment will require the users to obtain a licence.

I can see how this gets around the problem of sending cleartext passphrases over a network, but how does it help stop the problem of the remote system running a keystroke log that is handed over to the authorities during a bust?  Armed with 800/some-number they can just type the same thing into PGP (or a modified copy) and decrypt the files that you were keeping on-line.

Perhaps not.  The US user could send an encrypted message to a foreign
machine that offers, say, 100 different services, including a remailing
service.  You could not prove that the sender had requested a remailing
and thus he could not be prosecuted.  You could even randomly invoke one
of the other services whenever a remail is requested.   Other services might include ftpmail, archie searches etc...

@_subject: Some info on file/memory erasing on NT 
The subject of protecting memory and files from other users in a multi-user
environment always seems to come up here every few weeks, so the following
short article culled from the MS Win32 SDK might be of interest.
- Andy
File systems under Windows NT currently have virtual secure erasure (when a
file is deleted, the data is no longer accessible through the operating
system). Although the bits could still be on disk, Windows NT will not
allow access to them.
MORE INFORMATION
The NTFS file system does this by keeping a high-water mark, for each file,
of bytes written to the file. Everything below the line is real data,
anything above the line is (on disk) random garbage that used to be free
space, but any attempt to read past this high-water mark returns all zeros.
Other reusable objects are also protected. For example, all the memory
pages in a process's address space are zeroed when they are touched (unlike
the file system, a process may directly access its pages, and thus the
pages must be actually zeroed rather than virtually zeroed).
Note that file system security assumes physical security; in other words,
if a person has physical access to a machine and can boot an alternative
operating system and/or add custom device drivers and programs, he/she can
always get direct access to the bits on disk.

@_subject: Win NT proprietary pw encryption (Was: Re: Windows .PWL          cracker...) 
The encrypted passwords are in the "SECURITY" section, which the OS will not
let you change the permissions to.  Most user account information is available
under NT via the NetUser... API functions, the passwords are not.  You probably
came across the settings for the Security Account Manager, not the data that it
looks after.

@_subject: Win NT proprietary pw encryption (Was: Re: Windows .PWL cracker...) 
This will be really difficult, and in practice rather pointless.  NT does
not allow any user, priviliged or not, to gain access to any form (encrypted
or not) of the passwords.  They are stored in a protected area of the system
registry that only the OS itself can access.  The best that you can do is
to ask the OS whether a given username/password pair is valid or not, and it
took until version 3.51 before MS let you do even that!
Of course, rebooting the PC and inspecting the disk with another OS is not
an answer since in any decent environment you will not be able to march up
to the server with a floppy and hit the reset button!

How did you do that?  The SECURITY section is always greyed out and the
operating system will not allow you to change the permissions on it.
If you did indeed gain access to that area then you've probably found a
flaw in the tamperproof capabilities of NT.

The default (at least on beta-2 of ie) is to not trust anyone unless you
explicity say so.  If the user then decides to execute "k3wl kontro1" from
phreak.net then that's their problem.
Does anyone know what the legal implications of signed code are?  That is,
if Company A signs their Active X control and it's later found to corrupt
users data, does the signature (which is supposed to make the user trust
the control as safe), open up the company to litigation for damages?

You can do this with the existing device driver kit since they supply the
entire source code to the AT hard disk driver.  I took a look and decided
that it would be too much work for me alone.  They also seem to suggest that
you can write "filters" that extend the capability of existing drivers.
I'm one of them, but this low level device driver stuff makes me shudder!

@_subject: Distributed DES crack 
It's not a factor of the bandwidth, you search offline and send in your
results to a central server.
But first, a little reality check is in order.  According to libdes,
the 200Mhz Pentium Pro on my desk will do 1,827,997 ECB bytes/sec, or
228,499 ECB blocks.  A DES crack would have to try, on average, 2^55
blocks.  That would take my machine 43,798,875 hours, or 1,824,953 days.
OK, so let's be reasonable and say that a week would be a good time to
come up with a DES key.  We would need 260,707 200Mhz Pentium Pro's to
achieve this.
Looking at that, 30 days seems not such an unreasonable target.  We would
need 60,831 200Mhz Pentium Pro's to achieve this.
It seems obvious to me that DES is still *way* out of reach of anything
other than special purpose hardware.
- Andy (hoping he got his sums right)
PS. For those more acquainted with Sun hardware, an Ultra-1 will do
    1,683,647 ECB bytes/sec (gcc 2.7.2).
