Hi all,
   I am releasing premail, a remailer chaining and PGP encrypting mail
client, to the Net. If you are interested in using the cypherpunks
remailers, but are intimidated by them or simply find them too hard to
use, then this software can help. Premail will also PGP-encrypt and
optionally sign outgoing mail.
   The README file is attached. Please check it out and let me know
how you like it.

I classified c2 as an "eric" remailer because it has normal handling
of subject lines with Anon-Send-To but not with Request-Remailing-To.
I think it kept the subject line even when the message was encrypted.
This is a big hole for traffic analysis.

The most famous and widely used plagiarism detector here at Berkeley

It was used in the undergraduate compilers class. I believe the output
of the program is a list of pairs, ordered by decreasing similarity.
The professor spoke to the top two matches, they both ended up
confessing. He didn't check more for lack of time.
I believe the source code _isn't_ publicly available.
Good luck.

I've been thinking about the netiquette of sending PGP mail messages
to people, especially "people you've never met."
There are some people who publicize the existence of their PGP public
key in their .sig or .plan or whatever, but do not like to actually
receive PGP encrypted mail because it is such a hassle to decode.
Others, like myself, have PGP integrated in their mail, so it's no
problem. I would be quite pleased if every single piece of email I
received was PGP-encrypted.
How to tell us apart? I've placed the line "PGP encrypted mail is very
welcome!" into my .plan. Others who have automated mail decryption, or
who just like typing PGP command lines, might find it useful to do
something similar.
Just my $2E-2.

   There is also a Web version of the same information, at:
   Please let me know about any other remailers which I missed. I've
only included remailers which can mail to arbitrary addresses, so I
already know chop and twwells are missing.

Over the past few weeks, the remailer-list has been showing somewhat

@_subject: PGP Comment feature weakens remailer security 
Point well taken.
   I'm seriously considering completely disabling the PGP comment
feature when invoked from premail. In fact, that's what the new code
does right now.
   On an unrelated topic... cypherpunks like to count bits, right?
What is the correct number of pseudorandom bits to use in a MIME
multipart separator? If the data has a line which matches the
separator, the message is corrupted. Of course, if you can take
multiple passes through the data, you can simply verify that it does
not contain a line which matches the separator. But if you're
restricted to a single pass, then the only way to do it is to use a
randomly generated separator.
   I figure that 128 bits should _definitely_ be enough (that's what
is in the new premail code now). Even 64 bits should ensure that it is
unlikely that anyone will ever experience message corruption over the
expected lifetime of premail. However, it makes me nervous. What do
people think?

@_author: Raph Levien 
@_subject: PGP Comment feature weakens remailer security 
I agree entirely. That's why my PGP key at school is 382 bits. It's a
lot easier to compromise my machine than factor a 382 bit number.
So let me rephrase the question: what's the minimum number of entropy
bits that can be used and still give you that warm and fuzzy feeling
that you don't have to worry about the possibility that the message
might be corrupted?
The winning answer gets a free mention in the PGP/MIME Implementation
notes Web page:

@_author: Raph Levien 
@_subject: Mime/multipart (was Re: PGP Comment feature weakens remailer security) 
Yes, that's a good strategy _if_ you're able to take multiple passes.
However, the separator must (of course) appear at the top of the multipart
message being assembled. Perhaps we don't agree on what "single pass"
means; I meant you could do the processing in a Unix pipe without
requiring storage proportional the size of the data.
Not quite. As they say, "A-dice" is not merely clueless, but actually
For PGP encrypted messages, I just use "+" as the boundary, as it is
guaranteed that a valid PGP/MIME multipart/encrypted message body will
never include the line "--+" or "--+--". For the longer separators, my
concern is multipart/signed messages.
I chose "+" instead of, say, " because it will survive EBCDIC gateways.
You might argue that this is worrying too much, but doing the right thing
here costs nothing, and may actually save somebody some trouble.

@_subject: Small keysizes do make sense (was PGP Comment weakens...) 
Perhaps it costs you "nothing," Perry, but not all of us have the
massively parrallel 64-way interleaved banked memory nanosecond-latency
box you have on your desk.
Since RSA decryption is cubic in key size, it takes about twenty times
as long to sign or decrypt a message. Since latency-hiding (for example,
caching the decrypted session keys) is not widely implemented, the user
actually sees the difference.
For applications such as remailers, a 20-fold factor can make the
difference between smooth operation and totally hosing the machine.
Another reason to use small keys is to communicate the relative insecurity
of the machine to senders. A 382-bit key says, loud and clear, "don't send
sensitive or incriminating information using this key."

@_date: 1995-11-10 06:03:59
@_author: Raph Levien 
@_subject: Small keysizes do make sense (was PGP Comment weakens...) 
When in doubt, measure. The following measurements were done on a DEC
Alpha 3000/300, 150Mhz, Digital Unix 3.2. The first test file was an
email I sent this morning, with a size of 5379 bytes, which is typical
for the email I send. The second test file was the PostScript version
of a 52 page tech report done by our research group this summer, with
a size of 656676 bytes. The version of PGP used was MIT 2.6.2, compiled
with the default osf configuration (-O compile flag).
In all cases, user time only (not system time) is measured. This seems
reasonable, because neither compression nor RSA inherently require I/O.
The standard deviation on timings was somewhere around 5 or 10 ms. I
took the average "by eye" over about ten runs each. I did not include
signing tasks, as neither PGP/MIME signing nor clearsigning include a compression step.
Task 1: encrypt file, generating compressed output (RSA is quadratic)
keysize  compression  time   file size in   file size out
382      on           135 ms  2205 bytes      5379 bytes
382      off          140 ms  8165 bytes      5379 bytes
1024     on           1.14 s  2315 bytes      5379 bytes
1024     off          1.14 s  8275 bytes      5379 bytes
382      on           1.43 s  255575 bytes    656676 bytes
382      off          2.68 s  920984 bytes    656676 bytes
1024     on           2.42 s  255685 bytes    656676 bytes
1024     off          3.74 s  921090 bytes    656676 bytes
We can conclude that for small files, the size of a typical email,
compression is completely negligible, and the effect of key size is
significant. We can also conclude that for large compressible files,
compression increases encryption time by roughly two seconds per
MB, but decreases decryption time by roughly the same amount (by
virtue of having to decrypt fewer bytes).

Here is a draft of the CJR I intend to file, for the perl-RSA t-shirt.
Please check it over for technical inaccuracies or other problems. It
should sound quite familiar, as I have shamelessly ripped off the CJR
that Phil Karn filed for the Applied Cryptography book.
Let me know what you think!

This is a Commodity Jurisdiction Request for mass market software
with encryption capabilities.  The name of the software product is "perl-RSA t-shirt", by
Adam Back. It is published in the form of a t-shirt by Joel Furr, 916
W. Trinity Ave,  Durham NC 27701.
I have no DTC registration code.
I have reviewed and determined that this t-shirt, the subject of this CJ
request, meets paragraph 1 of the "Criteria for Determining the
Eligibility of A Mass Market Software Product for Expedited Handling."
I base this determination on the following facts:
a) this t-shirt is readily available from Joel Furr, and has been
shipped in quantity of several hundred copies, thus qualifying it as
mass market software;
b) sufficient documentation is included to allow installation and use
by any end user capable of typing in the software, or scanning the bar
code, and running it. Additional documentation is available on the
Internet World Wide Web at  . To my
knowledge the author and publisher provide no "product support" as
that term is generally understood; and
c) the t-shirt contains encryption software source code listings that
provide confidentiality.
A duplicate copy of this CJR has been sent to the 15 Day CJ Request
The t-shirt contains an implementation of the RSA asymmetric
cryptographic algorithms. Furthermore, instructions, in the form of a
terse usage string, are given for using the implementation to provide
confidentiality. The source code of the implementation is featured
both as four lines of text and also as a bar code, making the t-shirt
machine readable as well as machine washable. The algorithm is
implemented in the Perl scripting language, and will run on any
standard Unix configuration that includes both an implementation of
the Perl language and the common "dc" (desk calculator) program.
Two copies of the shirt are included with the filing of this CJ
ORIGIN OF COMMODITY
This t-shirt originates in the United States. While the primary author
is a citizen of the United Kingdom, living in England, other
contributors to the work are citizens of the US living in the US. The
publisher is a United States citizen living in the United States. The
t-shirts are manufactured and printed in the United States.
The cryptographic algorithm implemented in this t-shirt comes from
various sources, at various times, and was produced with both private
and public sources of funding.
The source code implementation contained in the t-shirt also comes
from a variety of countries, including Australia, Canada, the United
States and the United Kingdom.
The algorithm is thought to be designed for private and commercial
civilian use.
The t-shirt is currently publicly available from Joel Furr, at a list
price of $12.36, including shipping and handling. More ordering
information is available on the Internet World Wide Web at
 .
CURRENT USE
The t-shirt is intended as an implementation of the RSA cipher for
those who wish to incorporate encryption into their communications.
The small size of the implementation makes it particularly useful in
contexts in which existing cryptographic infrastructure is not
Examples of the commercial use of the cipher implemented include
integrity verification, authentication and confidentiality of
electronic mail, computer software, voice, video and other information
in digitized form. For example, the cipher is used either by itself
for email privacy, and also as a component in other protocols that
provide privacy and authentication, including PGP (Pretty Good
Privacy), S/MIME (Secure Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions), MOSS
(MIME Object Security Services), PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail), and SSL
(Secure Sockets Layer).
The uses of this cipher have not changed significantly over time,
although their popularity has grown substantially. Their present
military utility is unknown, except that it is believed that the
algorithm is not approved for the protection of US classified
SPECIAL CHARACTERISTICS
There are no military standards or specifications that this t-shirt is
designed to meet. There are no special characteristics of the t-shirt,
including no radiation-hardening, no ballistic protection, no hard
points (the t-shirt is only available in soft 100% cotton), no TEMPEST
capability, no thermal and no infrared signature reduction capability
(in excess of that provided by a typical black cotton t-shirt), no
surveillance, and no intelligence gathering capability. The t-shirt
does not use image intensification tubes.
OTHER INFORMATION
I recommend that this t-shirt be determined to be in the jurisdiction
of the Commerce Department. I believe that it qualifies for the
general license GTDA for General Technical Data to All Destinations,
because it qualifies as "publicly available".
I have enclosed two copies of the t-shirt, included with the primary
filing of this CJ request.
                                        Sincerely,

@_subject: Netscape 2.0 beta 
I just got Netscape 2.0 beta for DEC Alpha. Here are my initial
* Still no Java support (for DEC Alpha) :-(.
* I saw no hints of S/MIME support. Did I miss something? Do the
  binaries for other platforms support S/MIME? I have access to HP,   and will probably demand a Sun account from the powers that be
  here, just so I can run Java. I _really_ want to test S/MIME.
* The mail reader facility looks pretty good. The smooth
  integration of MIME and HTML objects is really quite nice. On
  the other hand, there are a few UI quirks that will no doubt
  get ironed out over the coming months.
* The .mailcap parser _still_ doesn't recognize %{variable} style
  entries. Thus, I wasn't able to test Michael Elkins' PGP/MIME
  format for compatibility with Netscape. The %{} syntax is in
  the spec (RFC 1524), guys.
* To send mail, Netscape apparently connects to the SMTP server
  running on localhost. I haven't confirmed this. Thus, I don't
  see any way to integrate Netscape and premail :-(. Guess I'll
  just have to wait for Netscape script (from what I've seen so
  far, it's not possible in pure Java).
* No user-defined headers from mail :-(. Thus, I couldn't put an
  "In-Reply-To: " header in this followup.
* News is also not bad, but I find I can't zip through tons of
  low S/N newsgroups the way I can with trn. I tend to rate
  newsreaders in number of messages deleted per second. I think
  with a bit more tweaking on the UI, it could really sing.
* One slick feature of news is its ability to decode binary
  postings, apparently in both MIME and uuencode formats. However,
  I wasn't able to figure out how to decode multiparts.
* The UI render code has a number of cosmetic defects (possibly
  related to the DECness of my machine). One new one is that
  drag-and-drops leave the Bookmarks window in an inconsistent
  state, leading one to want to press ctrl-L :-).
   Overall, nicely done. Mozilla will clearly remain the standard
in Web browsers, for the next few months anyway.

@_subject: Java power 
At the recent cypherpunks meeting about Java, I was fairly
skeptical of its power, especially its ability to do anything useful
towards interesting cypherpunk projects. I've been thinking about it a
bit more, and I believe I was overly pessimistic.
   My thinking problem was that I was envisioning Java as a
replacement for ordinary HTTP server interaction (such as CGI
scripts). I still believe that, absent HTTP server interaction, Java
applets are quite limited. However, now that I've started thinking
about systems that are built using a combination of Java and servers,
the universe has expanded a lot.
   I'm still unclear about the exact security policy implemented by
Java browsers, but this is my understanding:
   * No access to local files at all.
   * Can only access URLs on same server as applet came from.
   Actually, I'm pretty sure the latter is an oversimplification, that
the applet can contact any socket as long as it is on the same IP host
as the applet itself. However, since HTTP can do pretty much anything
any other socket can, the only difference that makes is performance.
   Here's the "big insight" I had: the server can make up _both_ of
these deficiencies, by acting as a file server and communications
proxy. Essentially what this architecture does is shift the security
burden from the client to the server. In this way, the applet can
become "net complete," rather than merely Turing complete.
   I see one big drawback to this approach. Setting up a server like
this is pretty expensive, and using it takes up precious resources.
Not everyone has access to a fully scriptable server, which will limit
a lot of people.
   One concern is the "parasitic" use of file system resources on the
server. However, there may be a certain amount of security through
obscurity that makes this ok. If all Java browsers enforce the policy
of only allowing connections to the home host of the applet, then you
won't be getting connections from other, parasitic applets. The
remaining danger is rogue Java browsers, and non-Java applications
that talk to the server, pretending to be Java applets. Some form of
authentication could be used to reduce the impact of these attacks.
   I do see this kind of architecture used to supply services at, say,
an organizational level. For example, the "scheduling" scenario could
be implemented quite handily, including authentication of access to
the schedules, and even distributed scheduling if the different
servers are talking to each other.
   Another scenario which works is email, even including transparent
encryption. This one is interesting to me, so I'll go into a little
more detail.
   In this scenario, the server acts as a file server for keyrings
(both public and secret) and mail spools. Here's a typical sequence of
events for me getting my mail and replying to one message:
1. I call up the JavaMail web page, which is just a wrapper for the
JavaMail applet.
2. The JavaMail applet starts with a forms-style login screen. I type
my username.
3. The applet asks the server for my mail spool (given the username
and perhaps also a password for authentication).
4. The applet displays my mail spool on the screen and lets me fiddle
with it, scrolling through it, reading messages, etc.
5. Let's say one of those messages is encrypted with my public key.
The applet, recognizing that fact, queries the server for my secret
key, encrypted of course (with a symmetric cypher).
6. I type my password to the applet, which lets it decrypt the secret
7. Now, that it has my secret key, the applet can RSA-decrypt the
encrypted mail and show it to me.
8. I want to reply to the message, so I hit 'r'. The applet gives me a
window for typing my reply. When I'm done, I click "send". The applet
queries the server for the recipient's public key.
9. When the applet gets the public key, it RSA-encrypts the message
and sends it to the server for delivery.
10. When the mail has been delivered, the server notifies the applet
of the fact.
   To me, this is an exciting scenario. Note that, as long as you
trust the browser, this lets you read your mail from anywhere.
   I have no idea whether this scheme is practical. One temporary
drawback is the speed of RSA operations. However, this will get fixed
when there is native code generation or a bignum library, whichever
comes first. Even before then, performance can still be good, using
two techniques. First, implement a cache of decrypted session keys
(also stored on the server in symmetrically encrypted form). Second,
don't display a new email message until it's been decrypted. That way,
the RSA operation affects only the latency of mail delivery, not the
bandwidth of reading through messages. Of course, these techniques
will also dramatically improve performance even for native code
   I can see people setting up servers like this for themselves.
However, here's an idea on how to set these servers up "for profit."
In return for providing file system and mail communications services,
the server would expect clients to search keyspaces during idle
cycles. When Java goes native code, the computing power thus tapped
could be quite substantial.
   I'm interested to hear what people think about these proposals. Is
this something that cypherpunks should be doing full steam ahead?

The difference is the ubiquity of the infrastructure. Indeed, nothing
in my scenario differs on a technical basis from encrypted telnet +
PGP. However, in my scenario, anybody with a Java-capable Web browser
would be able to access the service, just by clicking on a link.

@_subject: What is needed for S/MIME remailer ? 
sameer writes, among other things:
We very much need a command line interface to S/MIME, to use in remailers
and also for other kinds of testing/hacking. I hope one is forthcoming
Raph does indeed have some input on the matter. I am currently rewriting
premail from the ground up, and am about 700 lines into it. One specific
design goal was the support of other types of encryption, including
Mixmaster and MOSS in the first release, and hopefully others as well.
Basically, I'm waiting on a command line S/MIME implementation as
described above, most hopefully as free software.
In any case, the new premail is _much_ more modular, so plugging in
experimental email stuff should be pretty straightforward.

I have been told by several people that I did it wrong. Apparently
there are two addresses: one for mail, and one for couriers. The first
time, I sent it by mail to the courier address. This time, I also sent
a fax. From what I've heard, I should be receiving a tracking number
within a few days.
   Also, for those who were wondering, the "Arlington, CA" address was
merely a keying error. The actual envelope said VA.
   I will keep the list up to date with any further developments.

@_subject: Netscape as vehicle for cypherpunk agenda/the cypherpunk bully pulpit 
I agree with Sameer's points here. Netscape carries with it the
potential of revitalizing the cypherpunks agenda, but also, in the
worst case, making it irrelevant. What happens, I think, depends on
what we do.
On the plus side, Netscape 2.0 will, without a doubt, be the first
usable mail tool to incorporate real encryption. It may accomplish,
almost overnight, the long-held goal of making a nontrivial fraction
of Internet email secure.
Another potentially big win is the Java language. It seems to me that
it will be quite plausible to code up real crypto applications in this
language. Once coded, these applications will run on every important
platform in the universe, and can be accessible by the click of a
mouse. Perl-RSA was a sign of what's possible in the non-C world. One
caveat is the slowdown from the interpreted code (roughly a factor of
25). The best way to look at this is as a challenge, to use clever
coding tricks and intelligent architectures, including caching. The
speed of Java implementations will inevitably improve - in fact, I
might just be doing my PhD thesis on memory management in Java.
One potential downside, as Sameer points out, is the X.509
certification hierarchy. This ancient beast has the potential to
defeat many of the cypherpunk aims, most especially the possiblity of
anonymous communication. However, that's not a foregone conclusion.
The most important thing to be doing right now is to _understand_
what's happening. Over the next couple of weeks, I'll be reading the
S/MIME and X.509 documentation, poring over reference code, and (of
course) playing with Netscape 2.0 myself. We're much more likely to
get our agenda implemented if we are armed with a good understanding.
There are lots of ways around X.509 - maybe we can work our way around
it, maybe we can adapt it to our needs, maybe we can come up with
something better and get it replaced. Whatever the case may be, we
should not give up hope.
Netscape is one manifestation of the ancient Chinese curse: may we
live in interesting times!

Yep. This is the real thing. Qualcomm seems quite serious about making
sure that real encryption is widely available in the Eudora world,
without adversely affecting their ability to export Eudora itself.
I've exchanged PGP/MIME messages with the people at Qualcomm who
developed a plug-in for this API. It worked great the first try. I was
impressed. The PGP/MIME plugin is based on Apple Events communicating
with MacPGP, which isn't perfect, but it's probably the best that's
possible until either PGP 3.0 gets its act together or someone else
implements PGP message formats.

@_subject: Mixmaster message formats 
Yes. When an intermediate message is decrypted, the real message becomes
readable, but the random bytes stay random. Thus, your proposal is
secure against attacks on the link, but fails to attacks on the nodes
(i.e. reveals just as information as if padding had not been used).
I was suffering from the same confusion myself until fairly recently. I
even made a proposal for text-based type-3 remailer formats, which
contained this flaw.

Thanks, Futplex, very much for the heads-up on this document. Indeed it
is fascinating, and I feel quite validated. The discussion of the quality
of my service was particularly heartening - I'll put it on the remailer
list page if I decide to go for the publicity angle.
I'm also a bit concerned about a possible appropriation of my work. I am
especially concerned about the fact that it does not give attribution.
The quotations of my remailer page probably go beyond any reasonable standard of fair use, either legally or according to Net tradition.
For the time being, I'd like to lay low and not create too much smoke
until I figure out what to do. Of course, given that the URL has been
published on cypherpunks, there may not be that much that can be done
about it.

Well done. Very well done. I'm not sure why Brock is constructing
this hard-drinking bad-boy persona (perhaps he's trying to become the
Trent Reznor of crypto journalism), but the piece was great.
   This work sends a very clear message (which is obvious to
cypherpunks, but not to the pro-censorship side): that in practice, what
exactly gets censored has a lot more to do with politics, and a lot less
to do with the original good intentions of the pro-censorship forces,
than appears on the surface. There's no reason to believe that
government-sponsored censorship would be any more carefully done than
the privately available software packages of today. In fact, there is
ample evidence to believe the contrary; these programs are subject to
the discipline of the marketplace.
   Sorry for the mini-rant. Keep up the good work.

@_subject: NRC Session Hiss 
Full agreement here. Further, nothing that the PGP people are doing seems likely to fundamentally change this fact.
   Yes.
   Actually, this is the case in the current standard, but in the next one, it might change.
   I'll try to bring cypherpunks up to date - the debate is still happening on the smime-dev mailing list.
   A couple of weeks ago, one of RSA's consultants in Washington got what appears to be approval for certain relaxation of the export rules for S/MIME. The rules themselves apply to S/MIME only. They are also quite confusing, mostly because capabilities for message sending and message receiving are so asymmetric. I'll try to briefly summarize the characteristics of exportable S/MIME clients here.
   Signature generation is quite good - signatures can be generated and verified at 2048 bits. This applies both to messages and certificates. The limitations apply to encryption only.
   Basically, an exportable S/MIME client can transmit messages up to 1024/40 bit RSA/RC2 (or RSA/DES), and receive messages up to 512/64 bit RSA/RC2 (or RSA/DES, but in the latter case I would imagine it's actually restricted to 512/56 because of the keysize of DES). Note that the asymmetry actually points in different directions for the public and symmetric keysizes.
   Most users of exportable clients will want to generate separate RSA keys for signatures and encryption, otherwise signatures would be limited to 512 bits.
   In any case, the fact that RSA keysizes are linked to symmetric keysizes is _extremely_ good news. It means that that it is possible to tell whether the recipient is an export version or not. If the keysize is 512 bits or less, the default algorithm should be 64-bit RC2. Otherwise, it should be 168-bit Triple-DES. If you work it out, you'll see that this policy will not cause any interoperability problems. For example, if the default encryption algorithm were simply changed to Triple-DES, then export clients would be unable to read the message at all.
   I'm pushing to get this policy codified in the S/MIME implementation guidelines and also widely implemented. If this happens, there really wouldn't be much point in trying to keep PGP alive.
   Of course, the division into export and domestic versions would still probably ensure that most of the clients in the field were restricted to export-grade, but I think it's likely that the population of non-export clients will far exceed that of PGP, so it's progress in any case. Also, if S/MIME catches on, it creates a fabulous opportunity for a company outside the US to market good S/MIME clients.

@_subject: S/MIME key sizes 
There is no restriction on non-export keysize, as far as I know. Of course, if you do use a key larger than 1024 bits, then export clients can not encrypt to you. I don't consider this to be a serious limitation. I'd far rather see an error message of "cannot encrypt to client - your software is crippled" than "encrypting to recipient with super-duper 40-bit cipher". The more crippled the export version appears to be, the more pressure there is to upgrade to a non-export version.
   I object to the word "domestic" to refer to non-crippled encryption programs. I use "non-export" because that seems least likely to cause confusion. Keep in mind that clients developed outside the US are also non-crippled. The word "domestic" seems to unfairly exclude them.

@_subject: Java 
This point is simply not true, at least for Java as it exists in Spring 1996. Almost every Java applet I've seen has little UI glitches that prevent it from displaying and operating correctly on all platforms. Further, there are little glitches in the language implementation and library design that often cause portability problems. For example, the first cut of Hal's PGP applet had the standard UI problems, plus the fact that a "spinner" thread caused the entire browser to lock up -- on Unix, but not on Windows. And this was a 5000 line of code applet. Hal was able to fix the problems, but it's easy to see how the effort involved in this "portability engineering" could become comparable to your thousand-line makefile as applications scale    The promise is there, but Java has not yet delivered.
   Another concern with Java is that it acheives portability at the cost of enforcing a lowest common denominator. For example, all real Windows applications support OLE, and all real Mac applications support Apple Events. Java applets, and even applications, can't do either. To me, that makes the accomplishment of portability a bit less impressive, even if it were so.

@_subject: Proposal: PGPmail Plugin for Netscape/Mosaic 
I certainly don't want to stand in the way of such a plugin - it
certainly sounds like an interesting idea. However, the problem that
Netscape does not export mail through the plugin API sounds quite
difficult - it seems likely that, barring changes to the plugin API, an
entirely new and parallel mailer would need to be developed.
In the meantime, it is possible to integrate Unix Netscape with PGP
today, using premail. This includes fully seamless and transparent
support for PGP/MIME. In addition, you get support for the anonymous
remailers thrown in for free.
The main problem with the current release (0.43) is the lack of adequate
documentation. The near-mythical "next release" should fix that, when I
finally get it done.

@_subject: Netscape Mail Security and PGP Plugins 
I certainly believe this - PGP now has the first real challenge to its
continued viability.
I would like to emphasize (at the risk of repeating myself) that it now
looks quite possible that the limitations of S/MIME that I discussed at
the next-to-last cpunks meeting will be addressed. It hasn't been
formally decided, though. I'd say this is an important opportunity for
cypherpunks to make themselves heard. S/MIME as it is currently defined
has severe implementation weaknesses. There are two concrete proposals
on the table to fix these problems - lobbying the S/MIME people will
Undoubtedly a combination of both.
Almost undoubtedly still illegal, unless Pro-CODE passes.
No. As currently defined, the Netscape API does not export mail.
I hear conflicting reports on this myself, but my best guess would be
some time this fall - probably just a month or two before PGP 3.0 ships

Basically, we are not interested. We are not a free cryptanalysis

our main interest is integrating ciphers that have already stood the

Best of luck, though.

Further, known plaintext is actually a very reasonable assumption. In S/MIME, for example, the first 8-byte block of text is almost certain to be 43 6f 6e 74 65 6e 74 2d, (i.e. the string "Content-"). This makes the process of analyzing the results trivial.

@_subject: Free speech debate on MSN Encarta 
First, a heads-up on the free speech debate on MSN Encarta this month. I
found out about it because it was featured (sans URL, of course) on the
NBC Nightly News. Here's the URL they missed:
      One of the major axes of debate is whether programs like SurfWatch are
sufficient to keep pornography out of the hands of children. One concern
that was raised more than once is that children tend to be more
technically sophisticated ("computer-literate") than parents. I think
there is a point there.
My dad just got Internet access this afternoon. Basically, all he needed
was to install a PPP dialer and Netscape on his Mac, but it was a bit
too much for him, so he had a friend come over and help him out. I had
tried to guide him over the phone, but that just didn't work out (among
other things, Netscape really needs to change their "DNS failure on the
following hosts" error message to "you don't have a connection to the
Internet, dummy"). Adding SurfWatch or something similar might not have
been possible at all.
So here's a random idea: have an ISP that essentially firewalls the
Internet connection to the house, so that it is very difficult to get
unwanted stuff over the wire at all. The ISP can maintain and update the
latest high-tech tools, including filtering by URL, filtering by
keyword, and other stuff like detecting proxies. While they're at it,
they can filter out junk email.
Just a random thought.

Not quite.
   Double DES is subject to a "meet in the middle" attack (not a "man in
the middle"). Here's how it works:
   Let's say you've got unlimited storage, and you're doing a known
plaintext attack, so you've got both the ciphertext and the plaintext in
your hand. Then, just do all 2^56 decryptions of the ciphertext, and all
2^56 encryptions of the plaintext. Then, compare the two lists to see if
you've got a match. Since it's DES, you can save a factor of two in both
time and space, because it's got the complementation property.
   Assuming unlimited storage, three keys (168 bits) are equivalent to
two. However, since 2^55 is a lot of disk space, in practice a real
attacker will trade off space for time (it can be done). Thus, using
three keys is more work for the attacker than using two. So, modern
cryptographic usage is exactly as Bill said - three keys, three
encryptions. For example, S/MIME recommends the use of DES-EDE3-CBC (the
middle encryption is technically a decryption, although it doesn't
really make any difference).
   Glad I could be of service.

I doubt that the new company will have any connection with ViaCrypt.
It's been well known for quite some time that relations between Phil
Zimmermann and ViaCrypt have been, well, strained. I have no idea about
   Word of this has been buzzing for a few months. I first heard about
it at Sandy's party, for instance, and then there was that (somewhat
distorted) Usenet post by Vesselin Bontchev.
   Having a PGP Inc. could be either fantastic or a disaster. Phil has
shown remarkably bad business judgement in the past, so hopefully they
have installed real managers and will allow Phil to take a figurehead
role, which is one thing he's fairly good at.
   The main problem with PGP has been that there just haven't been
enough people working on it. The PGP development process isn't very
conducive to volunteers, either. I know I'm not the only one who joined
the team, enthusiastic to get 3.0 off the ground, only to leave shortly
thereafter, frustrated by lack of progress, lack of clear direction, and
a design that was growing increasingly more complex without solving some
of the most basic problems for users.
   Since Derek has joined the team, things are a little better, although
I still feel that there just isn't enough humanpower on the team. An
influx of money may very well change that. Let's hope so.
   Meanwhile, the biggest threat against PGP is S/MIME. In the time that
the PGP team farted around trying to define an API for 3.0, the S/MIME
people (starting more or less from scratch), came up with a new message
format, significant improvements to the X.509 certification hierarchy,
got major support from many, many vendors, and got the damn thing
implemented. S/MIME products will begin shipping early this summer.
   Recently, I've been spending more or less equal amounts of time in
the PGP and S/MIME worlds. The difference is startling. S/MIME gives the
impression that it's _happening._ From PGP, I mostly get the message,
"wait for 3.0, when that comes out it will solve your problems."
   The corporate world must feel this just as intensely as I do. For a
typical example of PR journalism that nonetheless captures the feelings
of the people in corporations who are actually deploying crypto, see:
         The final paragraph reads:
   "Observers say SMIME's capabilities will let it replace software
   based on the PGP code, which is widely used. Unlike SMIME, which uses
   a structured certificate heirarchy, PGP relies on pre-certification
   of clients and servers for authentication, a limitation SMIME doesn't
   face."
   The gravest weakness of S/MIME, on the other hand, is the fact that
it defaults to 40-bit encryption, without any way of automatically
upgrading the quality. I estimate that this will result in a few percent
of all S/MIME messages being encyrpted with anything better. This
estimate is based on deployment figures from SSL. For example, Sameer
Parekh determined that 94.5% percent of the accesses to his SSL-enabled
Web server used 40-bit encryption. There are two reasons to believe that
S/MIME will do even worse. First, SSL _does_ have an automatic
negotiation mechanism to select the best cipher, which S/MIME lacks.
Second, most SSL servers deployed are configured for 128-bit ciphers,
thus it is only necessary that one client has 128-bit encryption for
that to be selected. However, for S/MIME, both the sender's and the
receiver's clients must have 128-bit encryption. If _either_ one is
"export grade", then 40-bits must be used.
   Thus, it's a reasonable guess that almost all S/MIME messages that
pass through the wires will offer "virtually no protection," to quote a
phrase from a paper co-authored by the principal designer of S/MIME's
encryption algorithms
   Best of luck for PGP Inc.

There are hooks in 3.92 that can be used to add PGP support. The next
version of premail, 0.44, exploits these hooks. Unfortunately, there's a
bug in Pine 3.93 that prevents it from working correctly. In addition,
the hooks were not made to be MIME-aware, so it only handles vanilla PGP
messages, not PGP/MIME.
   Version 0.44 of premail will be released soon. I have a patch for
Pine, and there are alpha testers who are playing with the code now.

The S/MIME spec indicates the use of X.509v3 certificates, which, in
turn, are explicitly allowed to contain trust roots originating in the
client's local configuration. In other words, yes, the spec allows for a
Web of trust.
   The big question, of course, is how easy the key management will be
in such a case. Everything I've seen points to key management being
super-easy if you use VeriSign certs, and probably just as bad as PGP
otherwise. Unlike PGP, most e-mail clients will probably not come
configured with the capablity to sign other keys - in the X.500 world,
e-mail clients and "certification authorities" are two separate
   But it's too early to tell. There's a lot of ferment happening here.

@_subject: Transitive trust and MLM 
I'm really glad to see this thread. I think this is a problem that is
well worth thinking about.
   I think what is really called for is a model of when keys are likely
to be bogus, and when signatures, etc., are likely to be correct. Before
going into the math, I'll go through some examples.
   Any key that's "well connected" in the MIT keyring is likely to be
good. Specifically, if it's signed by lots of people, and each of those
people is reachable from my trust root, then I'm pretty much willing to
believe the key is good.
   Unfortunately, there are a fair number of reasons why a key may be
bad. A really _cool_ thing to do with a compromised machine would be to
sign a big bunch of bogus keys. Given how easy it is to compromise a
machine, this is a very real worry. I don't know if this attack has been
realized yet, but it's best to assume it could be and will be.
   Another weakness is the "clueless user" who signs keys gotten from
the Net, or otherwise not properly verified.
   I don't claim to know all of the vulnerabilities, but I do think it
would be a good idea to quantify them before designing a key
distribution system.
    Hal calls into question the value of signed keys. To me, this points
to the pressing need for better manual verification of keys, by
communicating secure hashes through the phone and on physical channels,
including business cards. These channels are more secure than the Net,
are more convenient for all but the most hardcore net.heads, and would
actually work quite well, I think. But I do think it would be nice to
have access to "probably good" keys for casual e-mail. With luck, a
densely connected Web of manually obtained keys can serve as a good
foundation for the latter.
   Now for the mathematical model. Signatures can bind keys to e-mail
addresses, or act as assertions that the signed public key is trusted to
transitively sign other keys. Let's assume that each signature has a
certain probability p of being good, and a 1-p probability of being
bogus, and that all probabilities are independent. These are probably
bad assumptions in the real world, but that's the difference between
theory and practice.
   Now we can actually evaluate the probability of a given key being
good. Consider a Monte Carlo process in which each edge in the graph is
present with probability 1-p. For each run, we determine whether the
recipient's public key (actually the binding between public key and
recipient's e-mail address) is reachable from our trust root. The
probability over a large number of runs is (given our assumptions) the
probability of the key being good.
   One encouraging consequence of this model is that densely connected
subgraphs can result in highly trusted keys even if p itself is quite
small. In a clique of size k, the trust is (very) roughly 1-(1-p)^k. For
example, if p is a mere 50%, then in a clique of size 10, each key in
the clique is trusted with a probability of 99.9%.
   This computation is (I think) known as the network reachability
problem, and is probably quite hard to evaluate. In practice, you'd
probably want to compute upper and lower bounds instead,
   Let's see if we can come up with a model that preserves this property
of giving high trust values to densely connected keys, yet is also
highly resistant to (some plausible model) of attacks against the Web of

I think with e-mail, you'd actually have to be running a packet sniffer

@_subject: Remailers vs Nyms - conflicting assumptions? 
Well, that would be a serious problem. The big question is: who decides
the routing? With the existing nym setup, the client decides the entire
route. The nymserver knows only the first hop. For the nymserver to be
able to route around damage, it would have to know that there is damage,
and that implies knowing the route.
One fix for the problem is just to refresh your nym regularly. If you
are lucky enough to be using premail, then just run "premail -makenym
nym at alpha". I'm considering adding code that automatically figures out
which nyms need to be refreshed when a remailer drops in the reliability
ratings and automatically does it, but that probably won't make it into
the next release of premail.
The fact that you can refresh nyms makes the problem you bring up much
less severe.

Nope. This RFC is merely a rehash of the pgformat.doc file in the PGP
2.6.? distribution. I'm doing an independent implementation of the PGP
2.6 message formats, and found this document unclear in a few spots. For
example, can anyone else figure out the weird CFB variant mode from this
document? I used a debugger on the PGP code to help me figure it out.
The PGP 3.0 "spec" that you're referring to is actually a draft for a
PGP library API. A couple of those got circulated on some PGP mailing
lists, but none have been publicly released, another example of the
secrecy surrounding the whole PGP effort.
Now that PGP Inc. is happening, it's not exactly clear whether the PGP
3.0 release is going to include an API closely resembling these drafts.
Hope this helps.

I'd be interested.
There's a few extensions I'm interested in, as well. One of the things
I'd _really_ like to see is a standardized, cryptographically strong
naming system for PGP keys. Derek Atkins and I threw around a proposal
(the SHA-1 hash, in hex, of the public key packet, including the packet
headers, with the length field in the packet header constrained to 2
bytes), but I'm not sure where that's headed.
The 8-byte key id is perhaps the biggest mistake in the PGP message
formats. I'm finding that it adds considerable complexity into the
message format code. For example, to check a signature, it's necessary
to iterate RSA exponentiation over all keys that match the key id. In
almost all cases, there will be only one such key, but to protect
against dead beef attacks, you have to do it.
In PGP 2.6.?, it's possible to exploit dead beef as a denial of service
attack. As soon as you add one public key with a given key id, it
prevents other keys with the same key id from being added. Thus, if I
were to create a key with key id 657984b8c7a966dd, and convinced other
people to add it to their keyrings, they wouldn't be able to add Phil
Zimmermann's key.
Knowledgeable users can get around this (for example, by deleting the
bogus key), but most people, especially those using automated tools,
would have trouble.
Of course, the main "extension" to PGP I'm interested in is a new trust
model and distributed database for certifying keys. However, at least
for the prototype, this can be implemented entirely on top of PGP (or
S/MIME, I think), so we don't need to talk about modifying the PGP
engine for this.

S/MIME has come a _long_ way. An earlier version (now called S/MIME 1.0,
although I'm not sure this is going to make it into any marketing
materials) had a couple of cryptographic problems compared with PGP.
Those problems have been fixed in version 2.0, which is expected shortly
(as an internet draft).
S/MIME 2.0 _defaults_ to 168-bit triple-DES, unless you're stupid enough
to use the export version. RSA key sizes up to 2048 bits are supported,
as are a number of alternate symmetric algorithms. In addition, digital
signatures are based on 160-biy SHA1, rather than 128-bit MD5, which is
half broken anyway.
In the meantime, Deming software is shipping a slick Windows
implementation of S/MIME, which integrates nicely with Eudora. Netscape
is expected to ship cross-platform S/MIME capability in version 4.0 of
Navigator (their original publicity materials were only off by a factor
of two ;-), and that will make a huge dent in the market.
In sum, S/MIME leaves PGP in the dust, both techically and as a market
force. There's still a lot of sentiment that PGP is one of "ours" and
S/MIME is one of theirs, but at this point it's the latter that has the
most promise of bringing encrypted e-mail to the masses.
If only X.509 weren't so darned ugly :-)

First, the S/MIME _spec_ is a matter of public record. In addition,
RIPEM is a free software, source code available, implementation of
S/MIME's crypto parts. So if you use RIPEM, you're in pretty much the
same position as using PGP (which, unfortunately, includes the
ease-of-use issues).
But how can you be sure that _any_ software does what it's supposed to
do? As someone (I don't remember who) pointed out a few days ago,
Kerberos 4 was available in source form for a long time, and it had a
really weak PRNG.
How many people have really looked critically at the PGP 2.6.2 sources?
The key management code, in particular, is pretty bad. I didn't find any
actual bugs (I wasn't looking for them - I was just trying to understand
how it worked), but it didn't leave me with much confidence that it's
completely robust code.
At least with products like Netscape, money is being spent on quality
You've raised a good question here. It's just that there are no easy

No. That's fixed.
I'll believe in PGP 3.0 when I see it. Last time I checked in with the
development process, it was in pretty bad shape. Hopefully, the roughly
$5M of capitalization for PGP Inc. will help, but then again, when's the
last time an infusion of funds fixed a troubled software project?
In their present forms, PGP and S/MIME don't differ much in terms of
patents. At the _protocol_ level, both PGP and S/MIME require the use of
RSA cryptography, which is patented in the US. Similarly, at the
implementation level, both PGP 2.6.2 and RIPEM 3.0 (now in beta) have a
license to use RSAREF for noncommercial applications. If you want to use
RSA for commercial use in the US, you either have to buy ViaCrypt PGP
(whatever that's called now), or one of the commercial S/MIME
implementations. In either case, you're still paying for an RSA license.
Actually, the situation with PGP is even worse, as it includes the IDEA
cipher, which is patented by Ascom Tech. Ascom holds patents outside the
US, which means that commercial users of PGP outside the US must pay an
additional patent royalty to use PGP (US$15 per user for single copies

I operate a remailer pinging service which collects detailed

   To use it, just finger remailer-list at kiwi.cs.berkeley.edu
   There is also a Web version of the same information, plus lots of

This is the current info:

   This is an automatically generated listing of remailers. The first

The winsock remailer does not accept plaintext messages.
The alpha and nymrod nymservers are down due to abuse. However, you
can use the cyber nymserver. The nym.alias.net server will be listed
soon. See  for details.
403 Permission denied errors have been caused by a flaky disk on the
Berkeley WWW server. Hopefully, this is fixed by now.
The penet remailer is closed.
When sending messages to AOL accounts, don't use mix, replay, or exon
as the last remailer in the chain - testing shows them not to work.

I operate a remailer pinging service which collects detailed
information about remailer features and reliability.
   To use it, just finger remailer-list at kiwi.cs.berkeley.edu
   There is also a Web version of the same information, plus lots of
interesting links to remailer-related resources, at:
   This information is used by premail, a remailer chaining and PGP
encrypting client for outgoing mail. For more information, see:

This is the current info:
                                 REMAILER LIST
   This is an automatically generated listing of remailers. The first
   part of the listing shows the remailers along with configuration
   options and special features for each of the remailers. The second
   part shows the 12-day history, and average latency and uptime for each
   remailer. You can also get this list by fingering
   remailer-list at kiwi.cs.berkeley.edu.

The alpha and nymrod nymservers are down due to abuse. However, you
can use the nym or weasel (newnym style) nymservers.
The cyber nymserver is quite reliable for outgoing mail (which is
what's measured here), but is exhibiting serious reliability problems
for incoming mail.
The squirrel and winsock remailers accept PGP encrypted mail only.
403 Permission denied errors have been caused by a flaky disk on the
Berkeley WWW server. This seems to be fixed now.
The penet remailer is closed.

The alpha and nymrod nymservers are down due to abuse. However, you
can use the nym or weasel (newnym style) nymservers.
The cyber nymserver is quite reliable for outgoing mail (which is
what's measured here), but is exhibiting serious reliability problems
for incoming mail.
The squirrel and winsock remailers accept PGP encrypted mail only.
403 Permission denied errors have been caused by a flaky disk on the
Berkeley WWW server. This seems to be fixed now.
The penet remailer is closed.

   This information is used by premail, a remailer chaining and PGP
encrypting client for outgoing mail. For more information, see:
