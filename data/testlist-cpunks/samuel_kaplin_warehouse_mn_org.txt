Could you imagine the ruckus if we were to try to implement something like
this today? P.E.T.A would have a stroke!! They already are in a snit over
the Navy's use of dolphins. Me, I just can't equate an animals life to a
human life...use the animal, save a human. I wonder if we could create an
Enigma machine based on biological organisms. Genetically alter something to
act as an encryption machine. Hmmm.....

:        I wouldn't even refer to him as a libertarian. He's very much
:into family values / universal military training / trade protection
:for United States industries. He falls very close, ideologically,
:alongside the state "militias" out in this part of the country. Those
:groups also profess libertarianism while also advocating extremely
:draconian Christian social programs.
He's also a crook. After his foray into Southeast Asia he went into the
treasure hunting business. He defrauded the widow of a man who had been
hunting for this one treasure. (Forgive me for the sketchy details, this
was on a show on the Discovery channel about 2 years ago. I believe the
show was "The Treasure Hunters." Took her for all of her money "continuing
the hunt" and never really did anything. On second thought he might just
fit in in Washington. He can pal around with Ollie North. They would
probably have a blast at one of Packwoods' or Kennedy's parties.   ;)

The question, Todd is are they edible? The last time I was in Manhattan,
the air pollution just about did me in. (mid-July, 95 degrees in the shade)
But then again these tomatoes are native New Yorkers, so maybe attitude is a
factor in their edibility. ;)

The main assumption here is that the populous and the markets realize that
they are in a totalitarian state. We in the U.S. are evolving closer and
closer to this and most seem not to see it, and if they do, not to care about
The senario that I see, is the borders being closed. (After all we HAVE to
stop all of these illegal aliens.) All of the firearms and weapons being
removed from private hands. (The crime rate is SO high this is the only way
to solve it.) The U.S. economy being isolated from the rest of the world.
(The world doesn't trade fair with us, so we just won't trade with you.)
Once your economy is isolated from the rest of the worlds who cares what a
dollar is worth. If the government says a dollar buys a loaf of bread, then
I guess it does. After all they have all of the weapons. The most incideous
thing is that the average American would go along with all of the
rationalizations listed above.

Never mind the keystroke logs, if his line was wiretapped they have all
of the keystrokes coming in and going out. Get his secret keyring from
Netcom and they could monitor his communications with out a problem.
What illusion of security? If I have my secret keyring residing someplace
where I can't physically control who has access to it, no way is this
keyring secure!! It goes against the definition of a secret. Once you tell
someone a secret, It no longer is a secret. In effect this person has told
Netcom his secret, therefore it no longer is a secret. Just because you're
paranoid, doesn't mean they're not out to get you. Be paranoid!!
This just goes to prove that no matter how secure the crypto system is, if
it is implemented in an insecure way, the whole system is compromised. If
you are using a "One Time Pad" to communicate with someone and you make an
extra set of pages and give them to someone that you really don't know and
trust (Netcom), no way can you call this secure. Even though most will
agree that the "One Time Pad" is the most secure crypto system, it is being
implemented in an insecure way hence it is insecure.

It's highly doubtful that they could physically get to my computer without
my knowledge. I service alarms for a living. I work for the company who
monitors my alarm. I am the only person who knows the specs on my alarm. It
would be pretty tough to conceal a court order to suspend the monitoring
from me. Someone would tip me off.  Plus the system will communicate with
me via 2 other methods that no one knows about. Pretty doubtful.
I guess it depends on your level of paranoia or guilt. :) If I was just
putzing around with the software, then I wouldn't be too concerned. If I
was actually doing something illegal or confidential with the software
then I would be greatly concerned. But under no circumstances would I
consider that arrangement secure. If the cops nail this guy, he has no one
to blame but himself. He hanged his own ass.
Then you have the possibility of people sending you secure messages on a
compromised key. (The one on the Unix Box) In most cases, its not the
technology that nails you, it's human error. Take for example the recent
Tiffany's robbery. The police hadn't a clue who pulled it off. I heard
statements of grudging praise from many members of the NYPD police
department. It was very close to the perfect robbery. They received a tip
from a citizen that someone was selling rings matching the description of
the stolen merchandise on the street. They busted this individual and he
sang. If they would have left the goods sit for a couple of years, they
would have gotten away with it. Human stupidity compromised the whole
This is probably true, but in most cases they won't have to take it from
you. Somehow someone will screw up and hand it to them on a silver platter.
Instead of John the Baptist's head, its yours! ;{
