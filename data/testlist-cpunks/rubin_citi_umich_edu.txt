Does anyone have anything on the speed of RSA encryption for
various key lengths on various machines?
In particular, I am interested in how long it takes to decrypt
mail headers on an IBM rt or RS6000, for various key lengths.
I'm sure this has been measured. Any help would be appreicated.

I'm not sure I agree that it is a good idea to start having
many accounts all over the place that are not traceable to their users. It seems like this would be a cracker's dream.

This isn't breaking DES. The best any encryption scheme can hope
for is to only be broken by exhaustive search.

@_subject: Remailers 
I contacted Eric Hughes, and he suggested that my question was of
general enough interest to share with the group. Here is my question
followed by Eric's response:
 ----------
You pointed me in the direction of hal's remailer at
        soda.berkeley.edu:pub/cypherpunks
and I have the code now. However, since I'm not that familiar
with perl, I'm having trouble figuring out exactly how it works.
Do you know if anyone has written a technical description of
how the remailer works?
I would like to build a remailer too, and I wanted to try and
understand how Hal's remailer works first. Also, do you know if
there is code available for any other remailers in shell script
or C?
Thanks a lot,
Avi Rubin
 -----------
Chael Hall wrote a remailer in C.  He should be willing to share his
code.  Ask on the list.
The question you asked me about understanding the remailer operation
is of general enough interest that you ought to just ask the list at
In specific, I don't know of any such theory of operation.

I am compiling a list of places that are actually using digital
cash. If anyone knows of current implementations, or of any
plans that will probably be implemented, can you please send
me the info.? Thanks a lot.

@_subject: Properties of hash functions 
Does anyone know the following, or can someone point me to the
proper references?
What properties are preserved by hash functions? For example, take
x = MD5(Y). Now, say that Y is a quadradic residue mod N, is it
the case that x is also a quadradic residue mod N? Are there any
interesting properties that are preserved by frequently used hash
Thanks a lot for any help,
Avi Rubin
