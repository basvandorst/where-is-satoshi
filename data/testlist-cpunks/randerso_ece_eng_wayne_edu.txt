@_subject: "Voluntary Censorship" vs. Govt Legislation 
Exactly!  Such a system (perhaps patterned after the Dewey Decimal System,
with expansion to handle fiction, news sites, etc or the Library of
Congress system, though I know very little about this system, and it's
probably too complicated to do on the net effectively) would allow you to
search for a site that contained information about "Green Eggs and Ham"
under children, for information about the Dr. Seuss book, and under news
for information about the nasty new genetic disease running through US
farms.  [finctional example, but I think the point got across, hopefully]
Two things need to be prevented to make this a viable solution:  NO
MANDATES from government, though a request for sites that are somewhat
controversial, such as adult sites to mark pages as such should not be
considered a horrible idea, this already happens to some extent in other
The second thing, and most important, is that web search engines need to
index *every* page, and allow the topical/categorization system as a way
to further limit searchs.  This would be a method that I think would remove most of the fears in
place.  Search engines can't start limiting indexes to just the rated
sites, or they become a *major* problem on the net, but improving
searching is not somethign to be ignored in this issue.
This is a much more important issue than the filter of adult sites.  It
happens to provide a convenient way to do that, however, in a manner that
allows parents to limit whatever they want... [ you don't want your child
learnign about certain things?  block those ratings.. adult sites will
probably have a better percentage of categorizing than most others, but
no matter what you pick, something will listed under that...)

It's just a matter of convincing the major search engines to use this
system over some others, and to change their opinions on indexing
non-rated sites.
The only problem with rogue indexers is that the drive space for the index
is just enormous (think about how many pages there are on the net, just on
the web, ignoring Usenet entirely... I think most of the serach engines
store at least the first 100 bytes or so of each page, plus all the
indexing... it's rather big..)

Remailers using this could be configured to not modify the "date" header
until final delivery.  Then you can base the probablity of final delivery
upon some function of date/time or another header
"X-Remailer-Max-Delay-Time:"   If you're worried about traffic analysis,
it is possible to randomly modify the date/time header by small amounts

or a rate)  when one remailer seems to be sending much more mail than the
others (which shouldn't happen if all remailers are randomly distributing
the mail to each other)  you automatically do the random forward to
another remailer.
There still exists a problem if a coordinated attack on the whole system
occurs, with large amounts of mail seeking to discredit a group of

this doesn't seem to help solve the problem very much.  The way SMTP works
right now, spammers can frequently just connect to somebodies SMTP server,

how the ISPs customers drop off mail)
All we get out of this is a way to blame those who sign their mail and get
slammed by a spammer.
Funny, this wouldn't seem to hurt remailers all that much.  You'd

Congress can only function with some idea of compromise in it.  When
you're passing budgets, especially the kind of budgets we have right now,
they get big and complicated, I can't see that changing significantly,
even with a massive turnover of members.  But having no consistency in

Look at it this way:  If you want some bill passed (some spending bill or
such) it has to get out of the Senate.  the senate can easily pull a
filibuster with a minority of the Senate, and shutdown the government
entirely.  If you really eliminate a sense of compromise on issues, you're
hamstringing the government.  It's really one of the fundamental things
that is required to make a constitutional republic such as we have work.  Remember, the founding fathers went way way way out of their way to make
sure that this was not simply a majority rules country.  Rather, the best
description I've heard of it is a "majority rules with minority rights"

Well, with one term per position, you have a problem with turnover being a
bit too high to give any consistency in government policy, and you (I
believe) would end up with the bureaucracy of assistants running the show
overall, with only minor adjustments for the current Reps.  Term limits of
some sort aren't a bad idea, though I do like the thought of punishment
for passing too many unconstitutional laws.  The proposed method has a few
problems in it that no one has suggested how to reconcile.  I'm at a loss
for a solution right now, I'm kinda hoping someone else will find one.
We've got a relatively decent style of government here.  I can see some
advantages in some aspects of parliamentary rule (actually, the tendency
of such systems to have more political parties is better, but adapting
that to us is more complicated.. Basically, Congressional districts would
have to die, and be replaced with everyone in the state voting for X/2
reps, where X is the number the state gets as a hole (This might not work well, but some method of voting for all the reps as a state, and taking
the best.. probably different math, but..). With this you'd have some more
smaller party candidates winning, and parties would stay a little more
focused.  (You'd actually have a libertarian influence obvious in
Congress, with the other traditionals, etc..)
This is the only alteration to our current form that I can see making
sense.  A President who claims to come from one of a few large world-views
is not a horrible thing, he/she tends to set a general policy, and it goes
from there.  The Congress gets to do all the real fighting, and there you
have lots of compromises among different groups.  Then again, this is
where the Consitutionality/penalty problems arise, but it's almost a
different issue..

The idea behind escrow in a company is to let each employee have their own key (and secret key/pass-phrase) so that they can digitally sign e-mails, and send encrypted e-mail, but with the escrow to let other people access this mail.  This is not any more surveilance than already exists in a corporate environment, and I believe it's main purpose is *not* inside the corporation, but for secure communications with people in other companies, typically partners, suppliers, clients, etc.
I can't see a problem with it in this situation.
Oh, and one of the bills in Congress seemed to prohibit the US Government from using escrow in this way in government agencies.  I can't see a justification for this.

Look a bit closer at the announcments:  I believe they said that they would compile a new version for each key that they used.  So it's not even likely that this could become a widespread feature.
For this to be useful for GAK, you'd have to change all copies in existence to encrypt for this key.  (And of course, then you'd have a very simple key-
id to search for in the executable and modify, say to encrypt back to yourself, and you'd have circumvented this little problem)
If you want PGP to get into widespread use in business, you have to provide features that they will require.  Frankly, this is good for encryption, to provide features that business needs.  With this, hopefully the business lobby will fall in line with the no-regulation-on-crypto lobby, and get all of us the results we want.

PGP for Business Security gives the business a way to have a backup key that can read that person's information.  Frankly, it might not be able to read anybody elses, from the description given.
This is a feature that any business (that understands encryption) will want.

Huh?   Okay, PGP uses IDEA for transit keys.  These are encrypted to two different PGP public keys.   These are only used once.  (Well, you make that assumption, but with even a decent PRNG it's a reasonably safe assumption)
The signature keys (in the proposed method) are the PGP keys (either RSA or DH, it's not important) are the personal keypairs of each person.  The company doesn't keep a copy of these.  They can sign with this in an unforgable manner.  (Well, in practice I doubt that's true, because I've seen very few places that have even mild local-workstation security, but that's besides the point)
Is there a problem here?
- From the description Jon gave of the system, you can designate anyone as
the other key-id to encrypt to in your signature block.  (Or whatever that part of the key is called).  The guy in the next cube, your boss, one company-wide key, etc.
So yes, in theory this could be used to implement GAK.  Supposedly in the version of PGP in use it's trivial to remove this extra recipient from the list of encryption keys.  It's not even needed if you don't have that key on your ring.  (From what Jon said)
When you compalin about use of storage keys/communication keys your clouding the issue.
The storage keys can be (and probably are in some cases) simply pgp encrypted files, as if they were in transit.  I tend to encrypt some files on my hard drive with pgp, by encrypting to myself and signing  so that onyl I can decrypt them, and I've got record that I did create the archive.  I can see this being done in a company to simplify shared storage usage without security problems.  Using the multiple recipient option your recovery key-id can be used to decrypt these files.  Of course, if they're modified, they can't be resigned, so you'd know, but...
This is a *simple* solution that eliminates problems with encrypting hard drives, etc. Where is the problem with this system?  This is software that (according to Jon's claim) at least one company has decided they need for their security, and it keeps the number of pass phrases that employees need to memorize at one - their PGP key.
Why not just encrypt it to yourself with PGP?  Isn't that simpler?  Add a recipient of the recovery id.  Boss, coworker, person's key in another division, whatever.  Everybody gets different storage keys.  No need to worry about accidently compromising one of the storage keys (IDEA symmetric keys, of course).  You then just need to keep the secret  halfs of the public keys secure.  Not a big deal if you have the rest of the system working.
What the hell is the difference?  Speed of recovery?

If I have your key, but not the other key that I'm also supposed to encrypt to, PGP (whichever versions, I'm not entirely sure how the feature set breaks down, but I believe this applies to all versions of 5.x)  will not even mention that there was another key it would've have offered to encrypt to.
Greatly complicating the "web of trust" method, but..  You can only chain signatures so far before you run into problems, and getting people to continuosly recertify could be a major pain, but I can see the point you are making.   It got clearer.
Well, at least with RSA keys, I believe the memory requirements to handle current factoring algorithms are quite untenable for 2048 bit keys.  I think 768 is out of the range of current systems.  I think this came up on the RC5 (Bovine) mailing list, and the figures for the required server was something absolutely ridiculous.  To distribute the job using the more efficient algorithm required machines with 128 meg of ram, but the slower one was a bit more doable.
In short, I don't think 2048 RSA keys are reasonable target in the forseeable future.  [Remember, Moore's law is only applicable for another 12 years or so.  Then quantum mechanics starts to be a serious problems, and electrons start switching channels in the chips.]
But this is a bit of a wandering topic now.  Let me continue...
Hmm.. I must've missed that.  Well, I wasn't really encrypting anything I really cared about.  It was backups of autoexec.bats and config.syss, I just wanted another copy that I *knew* when it was made, it wouldn't get overwritten, and it wouldn't get modified without me knowing.   And I needed something to use PGP for, so...
In all honesty, the public key baggage is 512 bytes ( I think, possibly bits.  I've forgotten now )  Quite insignificant if you're dealing with CAD drawings.  The added benefit of reducing passphrase uses is quite significant (with current PGP versions, the database of keys is a better idea actually).  Possibly more portable across a range of users as well.
I was actually thinking something along the lines of creating a file - encrypting it to your whole workgroup, and leaving it on a server.  Now you have the advantage of not having any security problems even if the server is compromised [without workstation compromise, of course], and all the important people can access it.  Of course, the last person to modify it resigns it, and it gets dropped into your RCS system.
you get the added advantage of being able to rotate your keys here as well, so even if one key is compromised, and the server is compromised, you don't lose the whole system.  Identical argument as for communications keys.
That's a different problem.  For that you're [in this ultra-theoretical world] probably going to want something along the lines of this:  Symmetric encryption for speed on the partition, and that key stored with several recipients in the same place as the Secure Partition Driver (SPD).  (This falls in the, "If you're going to build a system, make sure you think of everythign you want and make sure it fits in the framework somewhere" method)
I'm not sure you need to escrow anything, as long as there is a way to share things among certain groups of people.  Jon's ideas of non-hierarchical recovery systems seem a lot more secure anyway, especially with the rest of this thread.
Oh - for the situation with Andy Grove (Intel CEO) describe earlier on this thread - let me give this suggestion:
significant influence and a close working relationship.  Backup for problems with intransit e-mail.)
executives all have AG as the backup.  This elminates snooping entirely in the company, on the top level execs.  This partially hierarchical method wouldn't be horrible, and limits snooping to the level above you, or to peers, depending on setup.
Yeah, you covered them fairly well, and cleared up the issues where I honestly thought it was a fear-mongering problem.  I still don't completely agree with you, but we've clarified the problem areas.  Thanks.  (Too many wars get *way* too religous on the net.  Let's try and avoid that here, ok?)

Well, I'd have to point out that America still qualifies as one of the freest countries on the Earth.  It's just that the average has gotten worse (and we're a bit closer to it now than we used to be.)

Actually, I think you'll find that most people on the list think PGP's method is better than a lot of other things.  It is elegant.  But, as Adam has been pointing out, there are better methods. :-)
