@_subject: Surveillance blimp currently up over NYC 
For IP if you wish.
A couple of questions about that surveillance blimp currently up over
NYC.  I understand it has some VERY sophisticated cameras on board with
"exceptional" resolving power.  I'd like to know who provided the
camera and if it is actually legal.  IE:  If this is domestic spying,
who is authorized to do it and who is prohibited?
Secondly, what does such a surveillance blimp say about our
constitutional rights to freely assemble without restraint or
intimidation and our rights to free speech?
Thirdly, who gets to see the pictures taken?  Will they be subject to
FOIA?  Will they be archived in secret?  What is their fate and should
we be concerned?
What recourse do we have?

Why Secret Intelligence is Bad
Director of National Intelligence [DNI] Covers 17.5%
In the Age of Information, when secret sources are less valuable and
open sources are more essential in understanding reality and crafting
responsible public policy, what are the ten greatest threats to the
United States of America? What ten questions should the reformed and
revitalized Director of National Intelligence (DNI) be able to answer
for Congress and the public? This challenge has been answered
generally by the Report of the High-level Panel on Threats,
Challenges and Change, A more secure world, Our shared responsibility
(United Nations, 2004), but nothing the DNI is doing today is helpful
in actually addressing, in a substantive sustained way, each of these
