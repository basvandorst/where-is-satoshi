@_subject: Cypherpunk FAQ 
Hi, I'm new to the list, so please don't flame me too badly if this is a dumb question.  At least restrict the flames to private email where no one else can hear me scream.  :>
I downloaded the Cypherpunk FAQ from the Cypherpunk Website.  When I decompressed it, all it contained were the words "Yoo hoo, anybody home?"  Has the FAQ been corrupted or is this an in-joke?
Also, the Privacy FAQ states it was written by L. Detweiler.  Is this THE L. Detweiler?  If so, why is it in the archives?
Thanks for helping me out.

Thanks for all who wrote with help re: FAQ file!  I now
have several other sources from which to download the
file.  Looks pretty interesting....

Hi All
You were all so helpful with my last request, I figured
I would go for broke and ask for more advice.
The physical security of my computer isn't really that great,
so I've been interested in finding utilities that would securely delete the files I want deleted (as well as temp
files created, etc.).  I run Win 3.1 on DOS 6.  What do people think is the best free/shareware file wiping utility
(now, there's a Freudian name...) out there?  How about for
deleteing that pesky Windows Swapfile?   I know--best of all
worlds I remain in DOS, but this isn't always practical.  Any
advice would be appreciated.
Please cc me directly in your response as I've moved over to
Thanks again!

@_subject: The Great FAQ Hunt 
Several fellow newbies have written me asking to share
the sources I received re: where to get the uncorrupted
Cypherpunk FAQ (Cyphernomicon).  You can get it uncompressed--
along with a lot of other cool stuff, like the Applied
Crypto book--at Pat Farrell's Web Site (thanks, Pat!)
However, when I tried to summon up this 1.2 MB tome with Netscape, my computer choked.  Changing the cache settings
didn't seem to help, so I wound up downloading it via FTP
ftp.netcom.com /pub/tc/tcmay
where you can also get your hands on the shorter MFAQ (Most
Frequently Asked Questions).
Hope this helps.  I'm on an info-diet, Cypherpunk Lite, so if you want to respond to this message, please be sure to "cc"
me directly.

@_subject: Motorola Cordless Secure Clear Telephone 
Enjoying reading the latest discussions.
I was in Totally Wireless yesterday when I noticed a new product
from Motorola called "Cordless Secure Clear"--which supposedly
is a cordless phone which offers security/encryption functions.
Does anyone know how strong the security is on this phone? Is it just meant to keep my kid sister from listening in or
is it stronger?  Any info would be appreciated.
Please include a response to me directly as I subscribe to the
lite version of this list.
