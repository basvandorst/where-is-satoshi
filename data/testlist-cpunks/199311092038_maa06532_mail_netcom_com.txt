Well, I read the list here as a local newsgroup on cmu.edu, it's not
uncommon at some sites to do this, as it cuts down on incoming mail.  If
it becomes a problem, we could restrict posting access to "registered"
users, as is done on extropians, but I think it might be a bit premature
or possibly counterproductive to take such a step on this list.  I
prefer reading it a local newsfeed, since there is no digest version
availiable, and because it allows me to keep my personal mail seperate
from the list.  I would reccommend that if certain sites become a
problem by attracting flamers, communists, liberals, or government
authoritarian types, that we could remove them on a case-by-case basis.
