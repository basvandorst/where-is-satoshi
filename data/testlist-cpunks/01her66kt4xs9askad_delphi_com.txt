Naturally, the two aren't mutually exclusive, but I'll not buy a vault door for my house unless I've got a vault to put it on.
Anyway, I think the best key management so far is the PGP web of trust design of Phil Zimmermann's.  I think this could be extended for other applications, too, like encrypted IP (swIPe?) and the like.  I've been trying to think of ways to extend that to private key systems, too.
Peace to you.
