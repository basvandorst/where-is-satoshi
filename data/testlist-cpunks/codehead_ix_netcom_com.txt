@_subject: Seattle cypherpunks group 
I'm pulling together a local cypherpunks group in Seattle.  If you
know anyone in the area who is interested in issues of cryptography
and privacy, could you please pass this announcement on?
Emily Sandblade
P.S.  If you're ever in the area, I'd love to have you as a speaker.
***Please circulate to all interested parties***
Announcing the first meeting of 2001 of Cypherpunks-Seattle.
When:  April 14, 2001 12:30 - 4:00 p.m.
Where:  Bellevue Las Margaritas
      437 - 108th Avenue N. E., downtown Bellevue
      Space is limited, please RSVP to
seacypherpunks at ix.netcom.com
Agenda -
      Introductions and Open Discussion
      E-Gold and other Alternative Currency Systems
      Problems and Tradeoffs in Public Key Infrastructures
E-Gold and other Alternative Currency Systems
      E-gold has enjoyed increasing success as the first viable
free-market electronic currency.  It is privately backed, and
does not rely on any particular government's political stability
to retain its value.
      Vince Callaway, who wears hats as both an independent in-
and out-exchange provider for e-gold and Norfed and a software
engineer, will discuss the background of free-market currencies,
some of the current operating paradigms, and will touch on some
of the future prospects for these currencies.
      Vince has the distinction of having been an early BBS sysop,
moving into becoming Tacoma's first internet provider in 1991.
He has been involved both in getting Washington State's leginfo
site created, and was instrumental in getting a digital signature
law passed in Washington.  Vince also operates a PGP key server.
Problems and Tradeoffs in Public Key Infrastructures
      This could hardly come at a better time, after the
announcement that Verisign issued a Class 3 Digital Certificate
to someone who purported to be from Microsoft, but wasn't.  This
certificate can be used to code-sign things like ActiveX
controls, macros, and applications.  Anyone in possession of that
certificate could present malicious code to an unsuspecting user
and fool that user into accepting it into his computer.  ("After
all, it said it was from Microsoft.")
      Albert Yang will discuss what PKI--Public Key
Infrastructures--can and cannot do.  He will briefly cover the
basics of how PKI works, where it fails, and when and how
certificates can be trusted--and defeated.  In addition, Albert
has promised to give a glimpse of some of the new PKI
developments on the horizon.
      Albert is currently a security architect and PKI consultant
with Baltimore Technology.  Previously, he was a consultant with
RSA.  He has several years of background in Linux, BSD, and web
site design and programming.
The cypherpunks meeting is an Open Meeting on US Soil and it is
free for anyone to attend.

@_subject: What NAI is telling people 
I just got off the phone with one of the customer service people at NAI, who informed me that "Encrypted e-mails from certain countries aren't accepted in the US" and that accepting encrypted email from one of the "black list" (i.e., North Korea, Libya, Iran, Iraq, China, etc.) is illegal under US law.
When queried about the issue of *accepting* encrypted e-mail from a "black-list" country, the customer rep stated that this is what he was told by higher-ups in the company.
Never mind the issue of web-based email, mail originating from the dot-com, dot-edu, dot-net or dot-org TLDs, spoofed headers or open relays.  It was impossible to resist quoting Tim May on the transparency of national borders, and to point out that so far, anyway, there was no ubiquitous filter at the borders.  The rep backpedaled and stated that "some" ISPs, specifically AOL, were choosing not to accept such email.
Anyone have any idea if any ISPs are refusing to accept encrypted email from "black-listed" countries?
Or is this just a matter of NAI cluelessness?

On Mon, 16 Jul 2001 16:46:20 -0700, Eric Murray  That's exactly what I insisted to the NAI rep.  I suggested that he talk to their corporate attorneys, pointing out that there was nothing in the EARs that prevented reception of such encrypted email by anyone in the US; that the EARs specifically prohibited *export* of encrypting *software*--not encrypted messages--to the black-listed countries.  He, however, kept falling back on the Nuremburg defense ("I'm just following orders.").  No indication that he would make any attempt to ask in spite of several suggestions.  (Employment must still be pretty good in Silicon Valley, I suppose, if such people can hold a job.)
It's very disheartening to see what NAI is doing/has done to PGP.  It's especially disgusting in light of the pride that Phil Zimmerman and PGP, Inc., once took in enabling communications for human-rights activists in such "black-listed" countries.  Now such activists, according to the NAI rep, can no longer be heard in the US if they communicate by encrypted email--which, of course, may be the only means by which they can communicate safely.
Back to the original question:  It's obvious that NAI is operating under the belief that some ISPs are complying with some unspoken BXA idea/wannabe-law and blocking encrypted messages from "no-no" originating domains.  Is this really the case, or is NAI also full of it on this one?

Well, you can try calling the NAI number at 972-308-9960, and see what kind of story you get.
I'm still trying to get an upgrade, which is what I called about in the first place.  I've been having trouble dealing with one of their resellers, so had to go back to the source.  This matter came up when the rep told me that I had to answer "yes" to the three export questions, and I asked "Do you really think that such software can be kept out of the hands of those black-listed countires?"  He told me that it could because even if the people in those countries got the software, that it would be useless to them because nobody in the US could receive encrypted messages from those countries.
Why, I asked.  There's nothing in the EARs to prohibit reception of encrypted messages.  There's no big filter at the borders checking for messages.  After all, (quoting Tim May) national borders aren't even speed bumps on the information superhighway.  He conceded that while there was no big filter at the border, ISPs wouldn't accept such email.
Which ISPs, I asked.  He mentioned AOL.  Any others?  He didn't know.  I asked under what law they were required to filter such incoming messages.  He didn't know, but replied this is what the customer support people had been told by NAI management.  I suggested (more than once) that he ask the NAI legal department if this was indeed the case.
Might be also worthwhile to call AOL corporate.  This could evolve into a very interesting PR incident for them if they are indeed blocking such messages, when it's pointed out that PGP usage is essential to the work of human rights, relief, charitable, and even religious organizations in those countries.
On the other hand, what's one more nasty PR incident to AOL?

@_subject: abs@squig.org 
You are confusing misogyny with insufferance for fools and trolls.
The nominal purpose of the cypherpunks list is to discuss cryptography, privacy, and social issues relating to them.  Ms. Farr has done pitifully little of that, instead choosing to introduce silly "gender correctness" tests and the like.  In spite of Ms. Farr's "I am a cypherpunk" statement, she doesn't appear to "get" the rudiments as reproduced below.
I suppose it's to be expected from someone who got her bachelor's in "environmental studies" (Baylor, 1993) and then went on to a law degree.  It can take a long time to repair the damage from such Alexandra, what you're interpreting as misogyny is merely contempt for anything that smacks of stupidity and political correctness.  When the people on this list--some of whom *are* female--treat an equally clueless male in a similar fashion (and there have been many, many instances of this), why do you not then complain about misandry?
Despite some politically correct ideas to the contrary, defending women who are clueless simply because they are female does _not_ help the status of women.  To the contrary, it degrades those who do have a clue, forcing them into the same category with the inept.  If you want to see a level playing field in terms of equality of opportunity, lumping all women together into one lowest-common-
denominator class will not achieve that.  Neither will making knee-
jerk accusations of "misogyny" when somebody makes a fool of herself and is called on it.
Frankly, Alexandra, Ms. Farr was given considerably more latitude than most men on the list ever see.  Even Tim May was quite civil to her for an unusually generous period after her initial tortured-
English introduction.  Rather kid-glove treatment, I'd say, for a list that has a well-known reputation of being tough on bullshit.  Perhaps you should accuse at least some of the men on the list of "excessive gynophilia" instead.  That makes about as much sense.
