@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] Testing and reviewing requested for work on Bitcoin Core wallet 
Cozz Lovan has been doing great work on Bitcoin Core's wallet code lately.
If anyone cares about Bitcoin Core's wallet, for example its
performance, do help testing and reviewing these improvements so that
they can make it into 0.10:
Subtract fee from amount
[Wallet] Improve ReorderTransactions(..)
[Wallet] Replace OrderedTxItems(..) with in-memory map
[Qt] Call checkBalanceChanged() periodically instead for every updated tx
Move g_signals.SetBestChain(..) below SyncWithWallets
[Wallet] Call SetBestChain before and after rescan
[Wallet] Do not flush the wallet in AddToWalletIfInvolvingMe(..)
