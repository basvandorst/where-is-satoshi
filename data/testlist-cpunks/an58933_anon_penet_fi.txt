@_subject: data point re. Inman 
I have (sort of ) worked for Inman twice.  He is currently serving as a director for the company which employs me.
Recently, the company has launched a campaign to coerce employees to sign
agreements relinquishing their rights to sue the company and its officers if
the employees are willfully injured, sexually harrassed, etc.  I have been
told that this was done at the request of the board; certainly I would expect board review on something like this.
I don't know what position Adm. Inman took, but this still reveals a bit
about the corporate culture he contributes to.
