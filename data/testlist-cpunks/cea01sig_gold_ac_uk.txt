The first of these books is a collection of treaties, plus other
documents, concerned with the international fight against money
laundering.  The second explains how these treaties have been enacted
into, and are enforced under, the laws of the United Kingdom.  Both
works will repay the closest study.  In clear detail, they show the
growth of what must be called a New World Order, and how, without
some interposing cause, this may produce a universal slide into
The fight against money laundering begins with realising that the
"War on Drugs" has been lost.  When goods are portable and easily
concealed, and when demand for them is strong enough to bear almost
any cost of bringing them to market, the main effect of prohibition will
be to put a bounty on crime.  For all the efforts of the past three
generations, illegal drugs are available in most high security prisons. In much of the West, street prices have been stable or even falling
since 1980.
The official response, however, has not been to give in and legalise the
trade, but to expand the War to a front where previously there had
been few hostilities.  While keeping up their efforts against the trade
itself, the authorities have turned increasingly to confiscating its
proceeds.  This new approach has three alleged benefits:
First, it will deprive criminals of their incentive to enter and remain
in the trade;
Second, it will allow the punishing of those in charge of the trade -
people who never touch or see illegal drugs, but to whom the main
profits ultimately flow;
Third, it can make the War on Drugs self-supporting, and perhaps
yield a surplus for other public spending.
There is, however, one practical difficulty.  Before the authorities can
confiscate the money, they must find it.  To do this, they must keep it
from being merged beyond recall into the general flow of investment. This involves ending bank secrecy and imposing a mass of financial
regulation.  Now, most people - especially the rich - dislike having
their lives pried into.  Nor do banks like higher costs and limitations
on what business they can do.  And so, given the present freedom of
capital markets, no government acting alone can afford a strict policy
of confiscation.  It would, sooner or later, cause a flight of transactions
to more liberal places.
The solution has been to try making everywhere in the world equally
illiberal.  Such  was the purpose of the United Nations Convention
Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Narcotic Substances,
signed in Vienna in December 1988 [full text in Gilmore, pp.75-97]. This is one of the most important international treaties of the past 50
years.  It not merely requires its signatory states to criminalise the
laundering of drug money, and to confiscate it where found, but lays
down so far as possible a common wording for the criminal statutes,
and a common mode of enforcement.  It also requires full and prompt
cooperation between the signatory states for the enforcement of these
laws anywhere in the world.
The Convention had little direct or immediate effect on British law. Many of its requirements, indeed, had already been met in the Drug
Trafficking Offences Act 1986.  Most others were only met in the
Criminal Justice Act 1993, which enacts the European Community
Directive of 1991 on the Prevention of the Use of the Financial System
for the Purpose of Money Laundering [full text in Gilmore, pp.250-67]. This itself derives from the Vienna Convention only through the
Council of Europe Convention on Laundering, Search, Seizure and
Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime 1990 [full text in Gilmore,
pp.177-91].  Even so, this country is fast becoming a financial police
state of the kind agreed at Vienna - and where the process cannot be
traced to the Convention, it can be traced to the same international
pressures of which the Convention is itself a result.
Let me explain.  When I talk about a New World Order, I do not mean
some grand conspiracy of bankers, or Jews, or Illuminati, or even -
with far more probability - the American Government.  There are
countries where policy is largely dictated from outside.  But for rich
and powerful countries, the truth is more complex.  Most international
obligations imposed on this country, for example, were not only
consented to by our rulers, but were usually proposed by them, and
are enforced by agencies in which our own countrymen often occupy
senior positions.
Where others see conspiracies, I see public choice economics. Whenever a government tries to do something dangerous or
unnecessary, like banning drugs or educating the poor, it must set up
an agency through which to spend the allocated funds.  Once
employed, the agents will - as if directed by an invisible hand - start
to find more and more justifications for expanding their status and
numbers.  They collect the statistics.  They know which ones to
publish and which to hold back.  They are the politicians' first and
favoured source of advice.  They have their pet journalists.  They trade
favours with the relevant interest groups.  They know exactly how to
give themselves a pleasing life, and how to see off threats to it. Unless the money runs out, or the public turns really nasty, they can
write their own budget cheques.
By natural extension, the same is now happening at the international
level - though with potentially far worse consequences.  In the first
place, there is limitless money:  budgets would need to swell
unimaginably large to reach even one per cent of gross planetary
product.  In the second, public anger seldom crosses borders; and, if all
else fails, the politicians and bureaucrats in one country can shelter
behind the excuse of treaty obligations that cannot be unilaterally be
cast off - not, at least, without consequences more horrible than words
exist to describe.  Third, the enforcement of international treaties
means the growth of what is in effect an international bureaucracy. The local enforcers of a treaty may be citizens of the signatory states,
who will live and work in their home countries, and may even occupy
positions in the domestic administration.  Yet these are people who,
by virtue of the agreements they enforce, and the contacts they make
and maintain in other countries, are members of an international
order.  And, in at least the case of money laundering, they will share
an agenda that is often deeply hostile to their native institutions.
This can be seen - expressed with almost naive honesty - in the book
by Messrs Bosworth-Davies and Saltmarsh.  Both are British police
officers:  the latter is a departmental head at the National Criminal
Intelligence Service.  Both take it for granted that the world needs an
international police force.  Both are unable to believe that anyone can
disinterestedly object to the necessary harmonisations of law, and the
corresponding abolition of Common Law protections.  They "know one
senior clearing banker who has described this [money laundering]
legislation as the nearest thing he has experienced to
'McCarthyism'...".[p.172]  Of course, they see things differently.  The
     discloses, on mature reflection, a set of carefully structured
     laws which, with good will, due diligence and a modicum of
     responsible attention from the industry as a whole, should
     not prove too burdensome.  Indeed, the authors believe that
     some of the regulatory requirements have been diluted too
     much already, in a misguided attempt to placate the
     sensibilities of certain sectors of the industry....[Ibid.]
With people like this advising the politicians and lecturing the rest of
us, little wonder the Drug Trafficking Offences Act predates the
Vienna Convention by two years!  Though they will hotly disagree -
and even perhaps consider a libel writ - Messrs Bosworth-Davies and
Saltmarsh cannot be regarded as our countrymen.  More at home in
a gathering of Bulgarian or Filipino police chiefs than with any of us,
they are foreigners with British passports.
Somewhat less honest, though still interesting, is the Explanatory
Report of the Committee of Experts who drafted the Council of Europe
Convention [full text in Gilmore, pp.192-237].  Though formally
subordinate to a committee of the various European Ministers of
Justice, these experts plainly saw their first duty as lying elsewhere. Call it "the international community" or their own order, their duty
was collective and not to any single country.
Look at their dislike of the narrow focus of the Vienna Convention. They wanted something that would also allow confiscation for
     terrorist offences, organised crime, violent crimes, offences
     involving the sexual exploitation of children and young
     persons, extortion, kidnapping, environmental offences,
     economic fraud, insider trading and other serious offences.
     [Gilmore, p.204]
But they had to concede that not every European country might like
its own laws against these acts to be written by an international
committee.  And so they allowed each signatory state to reserve
whatever of these acts to its own legislative process.
     The experts agreed, however, that such states should
     review their legislation periodically and expand the
     applicability of confiscation measures, in order to be able
     to restrict the reservations subsequently as much as
     possible. [Ibid.]
And this is only the beginning.  As yet, the shape of world government
exists barely in outline.  But the tendency ought to be plain.  Power
is moving from national - and mostly democratic - governments to
unaccountable and even invisible bureaucracies.  Liberal institutions
that are often the work of ages are being hammered into the
transmitters of unlimited power.  We are beginning to known how
people in the Greek city states felt after absorption into the Roman
When the American militiamen cry out that the United Nations is
about to invade in black helicopters and plant microcomputers in their
bottoms, I am at least sceptical.  This is not the New World Order that
I see.  What I do see is actually worse.  We can shoot the helicopters
down, and dig out the microcomputers, and put the ringleaders on
trial.  We can go about playing the hero of our choice from Star Wars. But in the real world, there is no Death Star to blow up - no Darth
Vadar to push into the void.  There is just a huge, elastic network of
people, all acting in what they believe is the public good, most with
some degree of public support.
How this kind of despotism can be resisted is another question, and I
have said enough already.  But I will repeat - the books here reviewed
do repay a very close study.  At the very least, it is useful to see the
enemy's future plan laid out in such detail.

You may have seen this already.  If so apologies.  However, it is a
blatant example of police oppression and stupidity.  If nothing else, just
imagine how much of the taxpayers' money it cost to decide

Dear Sir / Madam
Pornographic Material on the Internet
Further to the seminar held at New Scotland Yard on 2nd August I enclose,
as promised by Superintendent Mike Hoskins, a list of those Newsgroups
which we believe contain pornographic material.
We have attempted to confirm that the Newsgroups listed currently contain
this offensive material but as you will be only too aware the content is
continually changing and you will need to satisfy yourself about the
nature and content before taking any action. Furthermore, this list is
not exhaustive and we are looking to you to monitor your Newsgroups
identifying and taking necessary action against those others found to
contain such material. As you will  be aware the publication of obscene
articles is an offence.
This list is only the starting point and we hope, with the co-operation
and assistance of the industry and your trade organisations, to be moving
quickly towards the eradication of this type of Newsgroup from the
Internet. At the seminar we debated the means of maintaining an up to
date list and you will recall that ISPA volunteered to pool information
and assist in this initiative. However, we are very anxious that all
service providers should be taking positive action now, whether or not
they are members of a trade association.
We trust that with your co-operation and self regulation it will not be
necessary for us to move to an enforcement policy.
Yours Faithfully
Stephen French

Oh, Come now!  Islam may in its present form be a religion deeply hostile to liberty.  But since "nuking" the whole Islamic world would not be itself much of a defence of freedom, the only long term answer is to promote within Islam the same kind of Reformation as eventually made Christianity half decent.  And Tim's comments do not contribute to that.  I don't know how many internet servers there are in the Middle East.  But, if I were an intelligent fundamentalist, I'd be copying it all over the place.  "Look", I'd be saying, "these people really do mean another crusade to destroy us and our faith".
I can understand Tim's disgust with these people.  But I do question his manner of expressing it.

True, there are risks in generalising from the actions of one individual to the group as a whole.  Nevertheless, where Islam is concerned, there are so many individuals behaving badly that we are justified in thinking the whole religion a force for bad.
Doubtless, I shall be told that "true Islam" is "true tolerance", "true freedom", and even "true apple pie".  I may be told that the horrors of actually existing Islam - remember this phrase, or something like it? - are all somehow the fault of the West.  But the fact is that most Moslems venerate old men in beards, who think that anyone who disagrees with them about God should be put to death, that a woman with a clitoris is a kind of devil, and that Western classical music is evil.
By my standards, these people are disgusting.  My only dispute with Tim is in our manner of expressing our disgust.

I never visited Nazi Germany, or the Soviet Union under Stalin; but I think I am justified in regarding them as nasty places, hostile to any concept of liberal civilisation.  Equally, though I have done my best to avoid visiting the Islamic world, I have seen enough *religious* Moslems here in England, and read enough of their material, to know that Islam is more often than not a force for evil.
Turning to literature, I have read my way through dozens of pamphlets sent me by the Islamic Propagation Centre International of Birmingham - the one that strikes me as most hilariously dishonest is "The Status of Women in Islam" by Dr Jamal A. Badawi.  I will upload a review of this tomorrow.  I also have a copy of the Koran, translation and Commentary by A. Yusuf Ali; and I have read much of Al Ghazali and a French version of "The Regency of the Theologian" by the late Ruholla Khomeini.
Of course, even if I list everything I have read about Islam or by Moslems, and read three times more, you would still come on this list questioning my right to form an opinion.  One tactic - used ad nauseam by the socialists - is to dismiss whatever I have read as works unrepresentative of the true essence and canon.  Well, I say that I know quite enough about Islam to regard it as a horrible religion.  I still disagree with Tim as to what response is appropriate.  But I agree with him that it would be a nasty day for humanity if Islam were ever to become the faith of a powerful and expansionist state.

Yes, Mr Tallpaul, I see you are upset by my reply to your threat to have me arrested in London and dragged off to New York to face trial for having sent messages to this list that found their way to you.  As I understand it, the division between the Shiites and Sunnites goes back to a dispute in the seventh century between Ali, the son-in-law of Mahomet, and Muawiya, the Caliph of the time.  Since then, the Shiites have divided and dubdivided into many sects, while the Sunnites have remained more or less united.  To this extent, the division within Islam is similar to that between Catholics and Protestants - though I wouldn't like to draw any comparisons between the doctrinal disputes of Islam and As for their respective sizes, estimates vary; but the proportion most commonly given between Shiites and Sunnites is 15:85.  If you have other figures, doubtless you will post them.
Yes, Mr Tallpaul, I can and will.  You should consult the various publications of the Islamic Propagation Centre International, at 481 Coventry Road, Birmingham, B10 0JS, England, fax - **121 766 8577.  You will find enough there to have any sceptic wetting himself with laughter.
In fairness, this is a good point.  I accept that a list that I joined in order to read about Phil Zimmerman and pgp is not the best place for discussing the horrors of Islam.  I will therefore say no more on the subject - not even uploading the review I promised in an earlier posting.  I shall return to lurking.

Is it not possible in the US jurisdictions to mount private prosecutions?  There is a common law right to do so in England.  Indeed, before the Crown Prosecution Service was established in 1984 - a fine year for bad laws in this country - prosecutions were usually handled by the Police, and were in theory private prosecutions.  They are quite often started even now by private individuals; and the Attorney General has an old statutory authority to take them over or to stop them.  But I do remember a number of recent cases of private prosecution for murder.  None of these, I think, has succeeded:  the reason the CPS refused to get involved was because of a lack of good evidence to get cases through the committal (grand jury) process.
If this right doesn't exist in American common law, I shall think far less of your laws than I have so far.

I wish I could give more information on this matter than I have, but here goes.  In the early 80s, when I was at York Universiy, a friend of mine in the Mathematics Department took part in a statistical analysis of the Letters of Junius, which appeared anonyously in the Morning Advertiser in London in the early 1760s.  They were ascribed to almost every writer of the age, from Birke to Gibbon.  Macaulay was convinced on external evidence that they were by Philip Francis.  Byu analysing the Letters and other writings acknowledged by Francis, my friend assured me that Macaulay was right.
I believe that similar tests have been run on works ascribed to Shakespeare, though I don't know what conclusions were reached.  It would be interesting to be able to write software that could mimic a style.  I hope that won't happen, since it would strip me of what small advantage I have when writing.

I agree that I was looking at *Arabic* Islam, in which specific bad
features of Arabic culture have congealed with the religion.  It is as if
I were to judge Christianity solely by reference to the Spanish Inquisition.
However, this being said, it is presently true that Arab Islam is the most important single strand.  It may be that the softer oriental versions will gradually take over.  If so, this is to be desired.  Indeed, so far as we can, we should even encourage this.  In the meantime, though, I think it wise to be aware of the nastiness of much actually existing Islam, and to challenge any claims that its devotees may make to moral superiority over our own civilisation.  I think I was too harsh in my postings of last week.  But I stand by my dislike of the Islam that I most often see.
Yours ever,
PS	I seem to be breaking my self-denying ordinance about postings on Islam to the list.  But this I suppose only confirms Tallpaul's doubts regarding the honour and consistency of libertarians!

       _The Status of Women in Islam_
             Dr Jamal A. Badawi
 Islamic Propagation Centre International (UK),
     Birmingham, no date, 28 pp, Pounds 1.05
                  (No ISBN)
I have  among my books  various works  by Hewlett Johnson,  the
"red Dean  of Canterbury", published  in the  1940s.  In  their
gushing, literal  acceptance  of every  Soviet  lie, they  read
oddly like  one of  Peter Simple's  parodies.  Was  this man  a
fool?   Was he a  villain?   Was he something of  both?  I have
never bothered  checking.   All  I can  say is  that his  works
remain  a good  example  of how  a  thoroughly evil  system  of
thought and  government can be  portrayed with  some persuasive
force as its exact opposite.
Reading Dr Badawi's pamphlet puts me strongly in  mind of these
works.  Of course,  I should never dream of  calling its author
a villain or exactly a fool.  I have no doubt that he  believes
every word  he has written, or  that he has some  understanding
of the  matters here discussed.  Even so, he does put forward a
point of view that is supported neither by a candid reading  of
the sacred  texts to which he appeals, nor by the most fleeting
glance at  any of  the societies,  now or  ever existent,  that
have taken these texts at all seriously.
Dr Badawi begins:
     The accusation that Islam oppresses women  is nothing
     new   but  a  perpetuation   of  the   centuries  old
     deliberate  distortion and  misrepresentation of  the
     Western world. (p.5)
He concludes, _inter alia_:
     It   is  impossible   for  anyone   to  justify   any
     mistreatment of women  by any decree of rule embodied
     in the Islamic Law, nor could anyone  dare to cancel,
     reduce,  or  distort the  clear-cut  legal  rights of
     women given in Islamic Law.  (p.23)
Taken in  their  ordinary, natural  meaning,  these claims  are
false, and are easily demonstrated to be false.
Let  us first  examine Dr  Badawi's use  of  the term  "Islamic
Law".   This  is not, as  some of his readers  might suppose, a
single,  unambiguous body of law - such as  can be found in the
_Code Napoleon_, or even, if with considerable training, in the
English common  law. It is  derived from  many sources.   First
there  is the Koran, which is a long  and not always clear text
allegedly  dictated  to  Mohammed  by  the  Archangel  Gabriel.
Second there are the _hadith_, which are the  traditional stories
of what  Mohammed said  and did  on various  occasions.   Since
there  are  nearly   two  million  of  these,  and  they  often
contradict one  another, there has been  much room for  dispute
as to their collective meaning.  Third,  there is the _ijima_, or
the  consensus of opinion among learned Moslems.  Fourth, there
is _qiyas_,  this being  a  process  of analogical  reasoning  by
which,  in  the absence  of any  other rule,  a case  is  to be
decided in a manner consistent with the existing body of law.
This aside,  Islam has over  the centuries   divided into  many
sects,  each with  its own  doctrinal emphases  and accretions.
It is therefore  quite impossible - except on the  most obvious
sectarian  grounds  - to  claim  the  existence of  any  single
Islamic  Law, or  any "clear-cut  legal rights"  held under it.
This allows  Dr Badawi to  sweep aside  many objections to  his
argument based on actual practice in Islamic societies.   Or so
it  would  were  he  only  to  admit  the  existence  of  these
practices.   He  says nothing  of female  circumcision, or  the
selling  of  brides, or  the  power  of life  and  death  often
possessed -  and often  exercised -  by Moslem  men over  their
womenfolk.   He does, however, allude  to them in the  expected
     It is... a  fact that  during the  downward cycle  of
     Islamic  Civilisation, [Islamic]  teachings were  not
     adhered to by many people who profess  to be Muslims.
     (p.23)
Yet  even  if  we follow  Dr  Badawi's  advice,  to  "make  any
original   and  unbiased   study  of   the  sources   of  these
teachings", we find  much that falls short of what  is normally
meant by  equality -  and much  that is  at least  inconsistent
with his claims.
Take,  for  example, marriage.    Here,  Dr Badawi  contradicts
himself.  He claims that husbands and wives  "have equal rights
and claims  on one another". (p.16)   He immediately adds  that
husbands have  the  exclusive  "responsibility" of  leadership.
His  biological  justification for  this  is  irrelevant -  and
would  remain so  were  it  true.   An equality  of  rights and
claims, plus  leadership!  There  is a  twisting of words  that
Hewlett Johnson himself might not have dared make so crudely.
Turning  to divorce,  Dr Badawi  makes no  explicit claim,  but
uses a  form of words that implies an equality of rights.  This
is   not  an   equality  recognised   by  any   Islamic  jurist
uninfluenced by  Western legal concepts.   The  general outline
of  Islamic divorce law -  an outline more or  less accepted by
all jurists  before this century -  was summarised thus by  the
Privy Council in 1861:
     It appears that by the  Mohammedan law divorce may be
     made in either of two forms:  _Talak_ or _Khoola_.
     A divorce by  _Talak_ is the mere arbitrary act  of the
     husband, who  may  repudiate  his  wife  at  his  own
     pleasure.  But if he adopts that course  he is liable
     to  repay her  dowry, or _dyn-mohr_, and,  as it seems,
     to give up any jewels  or paraphernalia belonging  to
     her.
     A divorce  by _Khoola_ is a  divorce with the  consent,
     and at the instance, of the wife, in  which she gives
     or  agrees to give a consideration to the husband for
     her release  from the marriage tie.   In such a  case
     the terms of the bargain  are a matter of arrangement
     between the  husband and wife, and  the wife may,  as
     the  consideration, release  her _dyn-mohr_  and  other
     rights, or make any other  agreement for the  benefit
     of the husband.^1 A  man can  divorce his wife  at any time, without  consent.  A
woman  must negotiate  and then  often buy  her  way out  of an
unsuitable marriage.  Again, some equality!^2 But Dr Badawi goes  further.  He appeals to  the Koran.   This,
he says, provides
     clear cut evidence  that woman is  completely equated
     with man in the  sight of God in terms of  her rights
     and responsibilities. (p.13)
I have  not space to  quote his  appeals to  the Koran on  this
point:   my readers  may find  them in  chapters 74:38,  3:195,
4:124, 2:36, 7:24-24,  and 20:121.  Anyone who reads  them will
find nothing  of any  substance.   I will instead  make my  own
appeal, quoting chapter 24:31:
     And  say  to the  believing  women  that they  should
     lower their gaze and guard  their modesty; that  they
     should  not display their beauty and ornaments except
     what  (must  ordinarily) appear  thereof;  that  they
     should  draw their  veils over  their bosoms  and not
     display their beauty except to their  husbands, their
     fathers, their  husbands' fathers, their sons,  their
     husbands'  sons,  their brothers  or their  brothers'
     sons, or their sisters'  sons, or their women, or the
     slaves  whom  their  right  hands  possess,  or  male
     servants free  of any  physical needs (ie,  eunuchs),
     or small children  who have no sense of the  shame of
     sex; and  that they should  not strike  their feet in
     order to draw attention to their hidden ornaments.^3 Let us  ignore  that if  this  is the  direct Word  of God,  it
sanctions slavery  and involuntary castration.  I will only say
that it has been used, together  with other verses of the  same
kind, to justify  at least the economic oppression of  women in
traditional  Islamic  societies.     It  limits  the  range  of
employments open  to them  - partly  by imposing  a dress  code
incompatible  with many  occupations, and  partly by forbidding
contact with any man not related to them.
Turning to  formal equality before  the law, take chapter 4:15-
     If any  of your  women are guilty  of lewdness,  take
     the  evidence  of  four  (reliable)  witnesses   from
     amongst  you against  them; and  if they  do testify,
     confine them to  houses until death do claim them, or
     God ordain for them some (other) way.
     If two men  among you are  guilty of lewdness, punish
     them  both.   If they  repent  and amend,  leave them
     alone; for God is Oft-returning, Most Merciful.
The  commentary here  leaves it  open whether  "lewdness" means
simple   fornication  or  homosexual  intercourse.     But  the
procedural  meaning  is   plain.    Men   can  get   away  with
repentance:   women are shut away  for life unless God  himself
comes down to say otherwise.
There is much more that  I could say.   A reading of the  Koran
is most enlightening -  though not in any sense that  Dr Badawi
might hope.  But  I have said enough.   Under Islam, women  are
most  emphatically  not  equal  to  men.   Certainly,  men  are
repeatedly encouraged  to treat  women with more  consideration
than seems to have been usual in Arabia  before Mohammed became
its ruler.  But this consideration falls short  of the equality
that Dr Badawi insists is the case.
In passing, I  will draw attention to Dr Badawi's  ignorance of
Western history and culture.  He claims. for example, that
     In England over  nine million women were burned alive
     in the 16th century. (p.5)
In reply,  I quote from  a letter  to Dr  Badawi written by  my
friend Judith Hatton:
     The total population  of Britain (not England  alone)
     was  2.5  million in  1500, and  about  5  million in
     1650.  Parish records show that there  was an average
     annual  mortality  rate  of  55,000, which  of course
     includes men,  women  and children.    To reach  your
     figure 90 thousand women alone would  have had to  be
     executed  annually,  without  consideration   of  any
     normal deaths.
That, I think, answers this claim.  Let us move to another:
     Even  in  modern times,  and  in  the most  developed
     countries,  it  is  rare  to  find  a  woman  in  the
     position of  a head of  state acting  as more than  a
     figurehead....  (p.22)
What about  Mary I and  Elizabeth I of  England?  Catherine  de
Medici  of France?   Christina  of Sweden?    Maria Theresa  of
Austria?   Anne and  Catherine of  Russia?   What of  all those
other European women  who enjoyed something like supreme power,
though only  informally?  And, against  this, how many  Islamic
countries  have  been  ruled  by  a Queen,  or  have  tolerated
anything approaching "petticoat"  government?   The only  Queen
who  immediately comes  to  mind as  the  ruler of  an  Islamic
country was Queen Victoria, Empress of India!
Again, take this:
     In the 17th century, the clergy in  Rome decided that
     women  had  no soul  and  would  therefore not  enter
     paradise.
But this is  a claim too laughable to  merit reply.  I only ask
Dr Badawi to produce a source to justify  it.  I am in no hurry
to receive  it, though:  let  him first become better  informed
about his own religion before he starts investigating another.
Now,  I suppose  I  should conclude  with a  general  statement
about Islam.  If  my tone in the above  may sound contemptuous,
it is not because I hold  Islam in contempt or fear.   I do not
share the view  of the remaining  Cold War cranks  in the  Tory
Party  that it is  the Next Great Enemy  of Apple Pie that must
be beaten down by  the same means that kept  so many people  in
agreeable jobs before  1989.  It is not a  necessarily barbaric
religion.   It enjoins many things  that are of enduring  value
and prohibits  or discourages many  things that  are bad.   The
Old Testament has  texts quite as savage  as those to be  found
in  the  Koran; and  both Judaism  and Christianity  have their
grim old men with beards who mutter these  texts whenever there
is  someone else  around trying  to have  fun  or do  something
generous.   Nevertheless, in Islam,  the old  men are still  in
charge.  That is the problem.
I dislike Dr Badawi's pamphlet and everything else  that I have
read  produced by  the IPCI.    But I  am  glad  that they  are
produced  in English  and  made  so freely  available  to  non-
believers.   Here is an  invitation to debate.   By  joining in
that  debate, and  winning it,  we  can do  far more  than  any
number  of  Gulf   War  massacres  to  bring  on  the  internal
reformation that  Islam so plainly  needs before  it can  stand
usefully beside the two other great monotheistic religions.

its having been cited by Mr Fyzee.

jurisdictions, and there have been Moslem  men settled in  this

it recognised in the English courts.  I will not  cite the many

=====================================================================                                                   A TIME TO BE DEPRESSED
As I write, news is coming though on the wireless of a mad gunman
in Tasmania.  Twenty people are said to have been killed, and
many more wounded.  It will not have the same effect on opinion
in this country as the Dunblane massacre, but it will add to the
existing reaction.  There will be more encouragement of people
to hand in their guns at the local Police Station.  There will
be a toughening of the draft Firearms Bill promised for the early
summer.  Whether this really will ban the keeping of guns at
home, it will certainly make them harder for ordinary people to
To do so, of course, will not reduce the number of criminal
shootings.  There might be fewer Thomas Hamiltons - though I do
not think there are many of these already.  But there will be no
fewer armed robbers and gangland "executioners".  Indeed, so far
as these might be deterred even by a public so little armed as
ours currently is, there will be more of them.
The real effect of a new Firearms Act will be to mark another
stage in the collapse of English freedom.  The more disarmed we
are, the more armed criminals can move among us like a fox among
chickens.  The more this happens, the more we shall cry for
protection to the authorities that disarmed us in the first
place.  In the short term, this will mean more powers of arrest
and search, and more video cameras in the streets.  In the medium
term, it will mean identity cards.  In the longer term, it will
mean electronic tagging and surveillance, and efforts to isolate
and remove whatever gene might be supposed to incline one to
criminal behaviour.
Now, given the elegance of this scheme, it is hard not to believe
in conspiracies.  It is even tempting to believe in them.  They
not only explain, but also give comfort.  For all their cunning
and malevolence, conspirators have the disadvantage of being a
minority.  They can be exposed, and thereby frustrated.  Inside
every conspiracy theorist is an optimist, never more than three
steps from utopia.  However, the truth is more depressing.  There
are surely people now calling for greater gun control who know
that it cannot work as promised, and who do so for motives that
range from the selfish to the sinister.  But these people are not
the source of the problem.  The real source is a wilfully
ignorant public.  There are millions of people in this country
who take it as common sense that limiting the availability of
guns will also reduce the amount of armed crime; and who will not
listen when told otherwise.  And this does not stand alone.  It
is just another instance of the more general belief, that
government action is the answer to every misfortune.
The belief would be funny were its effects not so dangerous.  A
few children are bitten by dogs.  As if this were a new and
alarming thing, the public demands and the politicians supply the
most imbecile law of the decade.  A ferry sinks because someone
left the door open.  Half the passengers are too drunk to notice
what is happening, and some of them drown.  The result - actual
controls that make crossing the Channel less of an adventure, and
a demand for controls that would make it far more expensive.  A
Minister tells us that most eggs are bad.  After the first wild
panic, the Government has to make a food handling law that shuts
down thousands of catering businesses, and makes food poisoning
more rather than less common.  Last month, the public got into
a sweat about guns.  Then it turned to mad cows.  From today, it
will be thinking about guns again.
Of course, nations have flourished with far greater handicaps
than the Dangerous Dogs Act and the prohibition of wooden
chopping boards.  I will even say that nearly eighty years of gun
control have not yet turned this country into a police state; and
another Firearms Act will not do so purely on its own.  Bad laws
are often tolerable while the structure of laws as a whole
remains stable.  But what we have here is a state of mind that
throws up one bad law after another - a state of mind that will
accept no restraints on its behaviour.  It is no good to say that
a particular freedom or rule of Common Law is worth preserving. It is no good saying that it has been established for hundreds
of years.  If it gets in the way of whatever "tough new law" is
currently in fashion, it will be swept aside without regrets or
second thoughts.
Here is the true engine of collapse.  Here is why the latest
instalment of gun control will not terminate in itself, but lead
on to worse.  And here is what I find so depressing about it all. For I have no answers to give.  I do not know why the British
public has become so childish, nor what to do about it.  I can
only say that, unless some other cause can be made to intervene,
things will end very badly.

         Putting the Case Against Gun Control:
       Reflections on an Outrageously Effective          Television Performance - May 2nd 1996
                     by Sean Gabb
         (Published as Tactical Notes No. 17              by the Libertarian Alliance,          London, May 1996, ISBN 1 85637 343 6)
                      2nd edition
Last 2nd May, a Thursday, I was invited to Scotland to sit on the panel in
Words with Wark, a television discussion show which replaces Question
Time there once every month.  The researchers, it seems, had been unable
to find anyone in the country to denounce gun control, and so had to make
do with an English accent.  Having found me, though, they did their best
to keep me happy.  I was offered a taxi from South East London to
Heathrow, which I only turned down because public transport is faster
during the day.  I was given a business class seat on a flight to Glasgow -
cost L120 - and a first class railway sleeper back down to Euston - cost
L85.  Then there was a stretched Rover to Ayr Town Hall, where the
programme was to be recorded.  Adding my fee - which I could probably
have doubled had I been inclined - I may have cost them more than the
average MP.  Nice work when you can get it.
On the panel with me was the Editor of The Sunday Mail, and a journalist
whose name I never caught but who looked just like someone I knew and
loathed at university, and Guy Savage, representing the Shooters' Rights
Association.  These first two were there to argue for a ban on the private
ownership of guns, the third to claim that the Firearms Acts 1920 to 1988
strike a fair balance between competing interests, and that this should not
be upset just because a pair of lunatics in Dunblane and Tasmania had
decided to shoot lots of people.  In the studio audience were four politicians
- Sir Michael Hirst, Chairman of the Scottish Conservative Party, Margaret
Ewing, from the Scottish Nationalists, and two others whose names I again
missed but which are not worth looking up.  I have no idea how many
people watch Words with Wark.  But I imagine the BBC had given me a
seven figure audience to regale with my opinions.
And my opinion is that gun control is wrong in any form.  I believe that an
adult should be able to walk into a gun shop and, without showing any
permit or identification, be able to buy as many guns and as much
ammunition as he can afford; and that he should be able to carry this
round with him in public and use it to defend his life and property.  This
is not a popular view, I grant.  On the other hand, I doubt if many armed
criminals would take more notice of a gun ban than they do of the present
controls.  And it is worth asking how many people Michael Ryan could
have killed had anyone else in Hungerford High Street been carrying a gun. As the Americans say, "God made men equal, and Smith & Wesson make
damn sure it stays that way".
I earned my fee by saying all this in the studio.  I am sure I pleased the
researchers.  They spend much of their lives talking to people who say the
most outrageous things on the telephone, but who then lose heart in the
studio and agree with everyone else.  The audience was another matter. Speaking on the Kilroy programme here in London, I could probably have
made people bounce up and down on their seats with rage.  Just as likely,
there would have been a few Dunblane parents to sob pathetically into the
cameras.  Speaking in Ayr, the response I got was a shocked silence.  I
looked out into a sea of faces that reminded me of nothing so much as the
Jewish audience in Mel Brooks' The Producers, during the opening number
from Springtime for Hitler.  At last, someone who claimed to be a minister
of religion and a father of two denounced me for pulling God into politics -
 as if that were not what He is there for.  Someone else who said he fought
in Korea claimed I was so plainly unbalanced that I should never be let
near a gun.
As soon as what passed for debate had started again, I took care to score
a big "own" goal.  An Olympic shooter spoke, followed by a clay pigeon
shooter.  They were not against a gun ban - so long as their guns were left
out of it.  No said I, this would never do.  The purpose of guns was to kill
people.  The only matter of importance was to make sure they were used
to kill the right people, namely burglars and street criminals.  From the
look on the Olympic man's face, he was thinking of quite another category
of people to kill.
Twenty minutes pass very quickly in a television studio.  I had barely
warmed up before my panel was ejected, to make way for the politicians
to come on and bore everyone stiff with rail privatisation and nursery
Afterwards in the reception, I found myself shunned like the lepers of old. The locals turned their backs on me.  Sir Michael Hirst looked straight
through me as I sidled up to him with my glass of orange juice - so much
for the party of individual freedom!  Guy Savage muttered that my
comments had been "unconstructive".  On the ride back to Glasgow, he
pointedly ignored me, talking to the driver instead about negative equity. This was a shame.  On the ride over, he had been very friendly, sharing
with me his vast knowledge of the present law on guns, and even agreeing
to address a Libertarian Alliance conference on the right to keep and bear
arms.  Realising that my presence was not desired, I pretended to sleep all
the way back.
On the whole, I did pretty well.  One of the great falsehoods of modern life
is that arguments are won by being "moderate" - by conceding the other
side's point and then haggling over the details.  They are not.  The gun
lobby, for example, spent nearly half a million after Hungerford trying to
stop the Firearms Bill that resulted from it.  I imagine most of the cash
went straight to a gang of sleazy PR hacks, who organised a few lunches
with politicians too corrupt even to stay bought.  What little found its way
into the media was one long grovel, by clay pigeon and Olympic shooters
begging for laws that would hurt only other gun owners.  They rolled over
and showed their bellies to Douglas Hurd.  Not surprisingly, he gave them
all a good, hard kicking.
Arguments are won by being honest - by saying what you believe as clearly
as possible, as often as possible, and never mind how "unconstructive" it
seems in the short term.  Doing so has three effects.  First, it shifts the
middle ground in a debate.  This is valuable in a country where being
moderate is so in fashion.  For this middle ground is not an independent
point of view, but can be pulled sharply to and fro by what is happening
at the extremes.  Before about 1975, for example, the public spectrum on
economic policy stretched between Soviet communism and social
democracy.  Accordingly, the moderates were all pink socialists.  Now there
are libertarians demanding a total free market, the moderates have become
blue social democrats.  And, though important, the collapse of the Soviet
Union was not entirely to blame for this - in those countries without a
libertarian fringe, after all, the consensus is still decidedly pink.  In my
own case, had I not been in that studio, the spectrum would have stretched
between a total ban and the status quo; and anyone trying to sound
moderate would have had to favour many more controls.  As it was, Mr
Savage came across as the centrist - a fact recognised by the people who did
not shun him as they did me, and a fact worth noting by the Shooters'
Rights Association if it ever wants to live up to its name.
Second, it gets converts.  Granted, my audience in the studio was full of
glum blockheads.  But there must have been dozens of people at home who
were hearing what I said for the first time and who agreed with every word
of it.  Most of these will stay at home.  Others - one or two, perhaps - will
become committed libertarian activists.  They will join the Libertarian
Alliance.  They will hand out its publications.  They will write for it.  They
will appear in television studios, putting the libertarian case on whatever
they have been called in to discuss.  Moreover, even the blockheads have
a function.  If they can remember what I said in the studio - not hard,
bearing in mind how clear I was - they will spread it by explaining to
friends and relations how scandalised they were by it.  Sooner or later, the
message will reach someone who is not at all scandalised; and another
convert will have been made.  And that is how intellectual revolutions get
under way.  With his claim that Hungerford and Dunblane were "failures
of policing", and the like, I doubt if Mr Savage enthused anyone to go out
and do something against the gun grabbers.
Third, it establishes a position.  Unusual ideas are generally ignored at
first.  Then, if they continue being put, they are laughed at.  Then they
must be argued with.  Occasionally, they become the common sense of the
next generation.  That is how it was with socialism in this country.  More
recently, it was like that with monetarism and council house sales.  I do not
know if my dream of abolishing gun control will be so lucky.  But, to be
sure, no one will take notice of it unless someone goes to the trouble of
clearly arguing for it.
Yes, I did pretty well in Scotland.  I may do even better the next time I am
allowed into a television or wireless studio.
Supplement - Saturday May 18th
I was allowed back yesterday morning.  I cast the first version of the above
onto the Internet on May 10th.  The following morning, Jim Hawkins of
BBC Radio Northampton replied by e-mail.  He had read my pamphlet and
liked it, and he wanted me to repeat it on his programme on Friday the
So there I sat for an hour yesterday morning, telling another million people
why the gun control laws should be abolished.  I was against Anne Pearson
(at least, that is how her name sounded) of the Snowdrop Campaign - this
being a group set up after Dunblane to press for a total ban on handguns. Though honest, she was not very bright, and I went through her like a hot
knife through butter.  When I accused her of wanting to live in a slave
state, she answered "Yes, I do".  When I further accused her of trusting no
one else with guns because she felt unable to trust herself with one, she
started to panic.  When I repeated my wish that someone else in
Hungerford had been armed, she referred to my appearance on Words
with Wark, saying only that I had worried her then, and I worried her
I said much else, ranging from the Jews in Nazi Germany ("what if they
had been able to shoot back?"), to Waco ("men, women and children
murdered by the American Government").  In short, I indeed did even
better this time than last - and if anyone doubts this, I have a tape to
proves it.
Enough of boasting, however.  The reason for this Supplement is to
emphasise that extremism does work.  Consider:
First, it was extremism that got me on Words with Wark, and an extremist
report of what I did there that got me on the Jim Hawkins show.  It annoys
me that I can never make the national press - versions of my pamphlet, for
example, came straight back to me from The Spectator and The Sunday
Telegraph, as if wafted on cries of horror.  Nevertheless, the electronic
media can hardly get enough of me and Brian Micklethwait and the rest of
us.  Whether or not we can ever win it, we lack no opportunity for putting
the libertarian case.
Second, it is extremism that makes us so effective in debate.  The gun
grabbers and other enemies of freedom have so far had an easy ride in the
media.  They have only had to argue with cowards and fools who, worried
not to upset anyone, have failed to make most of the good points.  They
have never known principled, uncompromising opposition.  Faced with it,
they behave like rabbits faced with a new strain of myxomatosis:  they have
no defences.  If Mrs Pearson was out of her depth with me, so at present
are all of her colleagues.  They have ready answers to the whinings of the
clay pigeon lobby, but none to anyone who asserts a right of self defence
against "burglars, armed robbers and other trash".
Third, extremism really does shift the middle ground.  In the main
pamphlet above, I was unable to give examples from my own experience. Since yesterday morning, I can.  Someone from a shooting club called in,
and said "I want to take a middle view between the speakers".  He then
argued against any change in the gun laws.  Without me there, he could
never have got away with that.  He would have been denounced as a
potential Thomas Hamilton, trying to save his penis extension.  Half an
hour of me, and Mrs Pearson nearly embraced him.  Guy Savage and the
Shooters' Rights Association - again, please take note.
In a few minutes, I will send this revised pamphlet to Brian, for publishing
by the Libertarian Alliance.  Before he even sees it, though, it will be all
over the Internet - there to be read by anyone else who happens to have a
studio to fill.
