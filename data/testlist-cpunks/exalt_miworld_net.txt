I am just wondering, when the USA can get a little bit more ridiculus.
They seem to have on there "good shoes" when if you look in the past, most of the goverment officals have been notihing but people that are involved with allot more ilegal activies than the average resident... i'ts sad what they will do, to get elected..                *                     *

Urk anything that looks child-like, can be considered child porno.. again, it's a scarry thought that they govt. can prohibit someting that they deem to be "alike" in whatever way they feal....  :(

does not matter - it will be renewed in the interest of the government
The goverment want's there backdoor...  would you expect less?

That is probably true...  But, i am sure that goverment is going to want to keep there backdoors, they have showed no interest in it's citizens priviciy as of yet...  and i doubt they have changed...                *                     *

Tho, I do belive, that the goverment wil never stop in it's quest to own its citizens.   This is changing the subject to much so i wont write on it...  :)
