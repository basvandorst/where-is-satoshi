I've got Hal's PGP mods to the remailer code installed on rebma.
The remailer is remailer at rebma.mn.org, and the PGP key to use is:
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: 2.0
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
See Hal's previous messages for how to use the remailer, or write me, and
I'll dig his messages up.
I liked Fen's idea about bartering remailers.  I'm all for it.
