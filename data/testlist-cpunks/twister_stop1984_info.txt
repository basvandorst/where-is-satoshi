Hello all :-)
I thought this might be interesting:
The anonymization service AN.ON, also known as JAP, is no more anonymous. The German crime prosecution organization BKA is logging access to at least one IP address. Obviously not all of the so called Mixes are coverd by the surveillance. No matter if the Mix is being observed or not JAP users easily can hide their real Internet IP by using a SSL Proxy. This is possible because the JAP Client does not transfer any IP addresses to the Mix. So the first Mix just knows the proxy's IP but not the client's IP. If the proxy does not log anything, or at least the BKA cannot access the system, the user can be called anonymous.
Therefore, German pro privacy group STOP1984 made up a list of 73 public proxies which are known to be compatible to JAP. To use a proxy you must change JAP's configuration as described on:
"Though we are very much aware of the explainations the developpers of JAP gave for their measures, we do not agree in the idea of an anonymizer being used for surveillance. Privacy, especially in times when it is so easy to grab data and personal information, should be essential and a service providing this privacy should not be forced into tricking their customers into thinking they are private when they are not." says Twister of STOP1984.
"We want to help people to re-gain their privacy by using JAP."
