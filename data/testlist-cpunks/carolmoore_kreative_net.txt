WACO UPDATE--August 18, 1998
By Carol Moore, author, The Davidian Massacre
Member, Committee for Waco Justice
          Because of weeks of computer problemsï¿½finally solved!--this
update is a month overdue.  Itï¿½s also full of news!
DAVIDIANS CONFRONT BATF AGENT AT SEMINAR
          On June 26, 1998 several Davidian survivors participated in a
Waco-related seminar in Austin, Texas sponsored by Texas Best
Seminars.  They included Clive Doyle, Sheila Martin, and Catherine
          Appearing with them was BATF Agent Dale Littleton.
Littleton allegedly is the agent who knocked over a Waco television
cameraman taking video after the failed February 28, 1993 raid.
Also, Karen Kilpatrick, who with her partner Henry McMahon sold
guns to Koresh, alleges it was Littleton who physically assaulted her
when BATF had them under detention during the 1993 siege. (She
and McMahon considered a law suit but did not meet the two year
          According to a Davidian who participated in the event,
Littleton faced a very angry crowd but skillfully avoided providing
any real information in his answers to questions.
For more information, go to  and listen to
"realplayer" audio of the proceedings.
BATF AGENT WINS CONSPIRACY SUIT
          According to the Waco Tribune-Herald (from which Iï¿½ve
freely quoted here) BATF agent Robert Rodriguez won a $1.3
million verdict in his civil suit case against psychologist Roger M.
Solomon in a federal trial in late July in Waco.  (Judge Walter J.
Smith, who sentenced 9 Davidians to 243 years presided.)
Rodriguez, 47, a 15 year BATF veteran, was the undercover agent
who infiltrated the Branch Davidian church and alerted BATF
supervisors that the Davidians had learned BATF agents were about
to raid them on February 28, 1993.  Despite this warning,
supervisors went ahead with the raidï¿½later claiming it was
Rodriguezï¿½ fault the Davidians ï¿½ambushedï¿½ them.  (Of course, there
is ample evidence nervous and aggressive agents shot first.)
          Rodriguez originally sued Solomon, nine BATF officials, the
BATF and the U.S. government. However, a federal appeals court
dismissed all but three BATF officials and Solomon from the suit.
The three officials, Phillip Chojnacki, James Cavanaugh and the
former BATF director Stephen E. Higgins settled with Rodriguez
for undisclosed amounts.  The jury ruled Solomon was responsible
for 25% of the $1.3 million.
          At trial, Rodriguez stated that the conspiracy by BATF
commanders ruined his reputation, left him depressed and suicidal
and caused even his own children to question his actions. He alleges
in his lawsuit that psychologist Solomon violated his oath of doctor-
patient confidentiality and told one of Rodriguez' superiors that
Rodriguez had changed his version of what happened. Solomon
denied he had breached confidentiality or that he was part of the
conspiracy with BATF officials to indirectly blame Rodriguez for the
deaths of four agents.  However, Rodriguez testified that he was
told by former BATF assistant director Ron Noble that Solomon had
violated his confidentiality.
          "My problems came from the cover-up, because that took
away all my pride," Rodriguez told the jury.  His new psychologist
told the jury that Rodriguez suffers from post-traumatic stress
disorder, major depression, mood swings, what he termed "survivor
guilt," insomnia, nightmares , suicidal tendencies and flashbacks
about the February 28, 1993 raid and April 19, 1993 fire.
          After the verdict Rodriguez said: "For me, personally, yes,
this trial was important for me to feel vindicated. I needed this public
forum."  Unfortunately, the Davidian victims have not yet received
the same fair forum to air their complaints about the BATF/FBI
conspiracy that led to the deaths of 82 men, women and children.
DAVIDIAN MEMORIAL AND MUSEUM AT MOUNT
          July and Augustï¿½s weeks of higher than average temperatures
have taken their toll on the 82 cypress myrtle trees planted at Mount
Carmel for the 82 victims.  Davidian survivors report it takes about a
half an hour a week to water and tend to each tree.  The few
survivors, with help from some friends, are keeping on top of the
job, as well as keeping their small museum open for the dozens of
visitors who still stop by every week.  So if you are in the area, feel
free to drop by. Because it is staffed by volunteers, the museum
itself may not be open.  To check on its hours a day or two in
advance call the museum office at 254-863-5985.
          Warning: Long-time squatter Amo Roden, sometimes with an
ally, will try to hit you up for an entry fee at the front gate.  Try to
ignore them.  There is no fee for visiting Mount Carmel or the
museum.  Hopefully, the local judge will finally give Mount Carmel
survivors clear title to the property during the long-delayed
September, 1998 trial.
          Directions to Mount Carmel: 1785 Double EE Ranch Road
east if Waco.  Take I-35 into Waco, Texas. Get Off at North Loop
340 (also known as: Lake Shore Dr.) Head East until you get to

JUDGE DEMANDS BATF ACCOUNT FOR WACO VIDEO
          On May 29, 1998 attorney David Hardy, who is helping with
Freedom of Information Act suits for Branch Davidian civil suits
against federal agents and officials, sent out the following news:
           ï¿½ATF had contended that it'd searched all likely repositories
of Waco info, and could find no still photos and but one video. It'd
conceded that there were 4-5 government videocams aimed at front
door, but contended none of their output could be found by
reasonable search, of the likely repositories (chiefly the evidence
locker of the Waco satellite office).  District court found that was
sufficient under FOIA and dismissed the claim against ATF (claim
against FBI is still outstanding).
          ï¿½I filed a motion to reconsider (VERY rarely granted)
accompanied by an affidavit from David Hall, which Mike McNulty
got for me. Affidavit said an ATF agent had told him there *were*
still photos, had shown him some, and that it was common
knowledge that the main repository for Waco evidence was not the
Waco office but the Murrah building in Oklahoma City; after the
bombing the files were recovered and moved. Government
responded that they'd done an adequate search and the affidavit
showed nothing new--it merely said it was "common knowledge,"
          ï¿½Court ruled May 26 (got copy today) granting the motion to
reconsider, and ordering gov't to provide within 30 days affidavits
from the agent as to the photos, whether they were stored at the
Murrah building, their relocation and any current known
whereabouts, plus affidavits to show either that they were not stored
there or have been located and searched.ï¿½
          Keep fighting for that information, David!
CAUSE FOUNDATION AND CONFEDERATE FLAG
          Cause Foundation, which offered its services to Davidians
during the siege and originated the first Davidian survivor and family
civil suits against the government, has suspended fundraising and its
newsletter.  However, attorney Kirk Lyons is still working on the
case.  In a last letter to supporters, Lyons blamed the moves on
decreased support for the Waco case, as well as "demonization" of
Cause efforts by Oklahoma conspiracy theorists and others who
have questioned Lyons' friendship with Andrew Strassmeier, who
some charge was involved with the bombing. However, funds to
support the Waco case, including to help preserve vital evidence,
still can be sent to: Cause Foundation, 1112 ï¿½ Montreat Road, Suite
1, P.O. Box 1235, Black Mountain, NC 28711.
          Enclosed with that mailing was a flyer about the organization
Kirk Lyons now works for, the Southern Legal Resource Center,
which bills itself as the "ACLU for the Confederate flag." I received
the letter just a few days before running into an African-American
libertarian wearing a shirt from the "NuSouth" company.  The shirt
sported a small Confederate flag logo in "African" colors of red,
black and green.  In an article on its web page, NuSouth's young
black owners state: "The logo, once you get it, is a simple message
of hard work, self-improvement and independence, a complete
rejection of the lingering rhetoric of victimization."  See
          I e-mailed Lyons, asking how he felt about this permutation of
the confederate flag and the implicit "we'll support your secession if
you support oursï¿½ feel.  Lyons replied:  "Making many little
countries out of big countries - I can't be against it. Liberty is
lost within Empires, and tends to flourish in smaller states."  It
would be nice to see a "win-win" solution on that one issue, anyway!
SECRET SERVICE WACO COVER-UP ARTIST EXPOSED
          On June 6, 1998, Joseph Farah, editor of the Internet
newspaper WorldNetDaily.com  published an article entitled: ï¿½Donï¿½t
Trust Secret Service Directorï¿½  Below are some quotes evidencing
that at least some of the press is aware of the all-pervasiveness of the
Waco massacre cover-up:
           Secret Service Director Lewis Merletti is letting it be known
that he will "fight to the death" to prevent Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr from pursuing testimony about Oval Office secrets by
his agents.
          Merletti claims that forcing Secret Service agents to testify
whether they saw President Clinton in compromising positions with
women would be tantamount to "handcuffing" his ability to keep the
president safe. He goes so far as to suggest that if he cooperates
with Starr, "the inevitable result will be the death of another
          At first blush, you might chalk up such rhetoric to an
administrator standing up for his employees. But there's much more
at work here. You see, Secret Service Director Lewis Merletti is one
of this administration's many professional cover-up artists.
          Why do I say that? Well, because he's a veteran of one of the
first major cover-ups of the Clinton administration. He was
promoted to director of the Secret Service after serving as assistant
project director of the Waco Administrative Review Team created
by Clinton's Department of the Treasury....
          That's where Merletti comes in. Then a Secret Service agent,
he was assigned a key role in the first investigation of Waco. He
claimed in congressional testimony that every single BATF agent he
interviewed understood that the raid would be aborted if met with
resistance. He was contradicted not just by officials on the scene but
by his superior in the investigation as well...
          Merletti owes his career to Bill Clinton. He got his job by
carrying water for the administration in its first major scandal. Is it
any wonder he's taking a stonewall-the-investigation position now?

RENO OPPOSES CITIZENS PROTECTION ACT OF 1998
          In June U.S. Reps. Joseph McDade, R-Pa., and John Murtha,
D-Pa., introduced a bill, the Citizens Protection Act of 1998 (H.R.
3396), to protect U.S. citizens from frame-ups by the U.S.
Department of Justice. (Both men are survivors of attempted Justice
Department frame-ups.)  The bill had 169 sponsors as of mid-July.
          Rep. McDade notes that "there are Justice Department
employees who engage in questionable conduct without penalty and
without  oversight, using the full weight and power of the U.S.
government.ï¿½  As we all know, the Justice Department did just that
to the Davidian prisoners, seven of whom are now serving a total of
235 years.  Memos disclosed during the House Waco hearings
showed they squashed Treasury Department interviews with BATF
agents who attacked Mt. Carmel February 28, 1993.
Officialsï¿½including the Associate Attorney General Webster
Hubbellï¿½knew such interviews might provide ï¿½exculpatory materialï¿½
that could prove the Davidians were innocent, i.e., prove they were
victims of such a vicious attack that self-defense was legally
          The bill would require U.S. attorneys to comply with state
laws and create a misconduct review board with the power to obtain
and make public information concerning investigations, classified
material and other confidential information.  At her weekly press
briefing in late June Attorney General Janet Reno told the press: ï¿½I
think the sponsors of this ill are trying to solve a problem that really
doesnï¿½t exist.ï¿½

PROSECUTOR TO APPEAL RUBY RIDGE DISMISSAL
          In late May, 1998 Boundary County, Idaho, prosecutor
Denise Woodbury announced she was appealing the dismissal of an
involuntary manslaughter charge against FBI sharpshooter Lon
Horiuchi who killed Vicki Weaver during the 1992 Ruby Ridge
siege.  U.S. District Judge Edward Lodge dismissed Utah state
charges against Horiuchi on May 14.  Lodge accepted the Justice
Department argument that Horiuchi was acting in the line of duty
when he fired and was protected by the Supremacy Clause of the
U.S. Constitution.
          However, if states cannot prosecute federal agents who
killï¿½and there currently is no federal law allowing prosecution of
murderous agentsï¿½it is evident we are living in a defacto police state.
(There are laws against federal agents depriving a person of civil
rights under specific circumstances but they are regarded as
relatively minor offenses.)
          Some have suggested that the charges should have been
brought against the persons who issued the "shoot on sight" order
(Hostage Rescue Team Commander Richard Rogers under
advisement from former FBI Deputy Director Larry Potts.)  The
reasoning is that while the sniper can claim that he followed the
orders--legal or not--the person issuing the order has no such
defense. And, under the law of most states, any person who aids,
advises or counsels commission of a crime--let alone orders it--is
guilty of the crime as if he'd committed it himself.  In fact, they
might even be prosecuted for murder. However, it is unlikely that
the Utah prosecutor will take this approach.
LIBERTARIAN PARTY CALLS FOR IMPEACHMENT OF
          As a member of the Libertarian Party, I attended its national
convention in early July.  A number of libertarians already were in
agreement that the party should call for impeachment of  President
Bill Clinton.
          On Sunday, July 5th, I got a chance to address the convention
as a protest candidate for party office. (I lost on the second ballot
but made my point against a candidate who favors watering down
the Libertarian Party platform.)  In my speech I urged delegates to
vote for Clinton's impeachment because of his obstruction of justice
in the investigation of the BATF and FBI's crimes against the Branch
Davidians.  A short time later the Minnesota delegation made the
following proposal from the floor, which was adopted by the
convention as a whole:
          ï¿½Resolution of the 1998 LP National Convention
          ï¿½Be it resolved: The Libertarian Party urges the U.S. House
of Representatives    to begin Articles of Impeachment against
President Clinton and Vice President Gore for violation of their oath
of office, specifically their failure to uphold and defend the United
States Constitution.ï¿½
          The party later sent out a press release announcing the
new position on the Impeachment of President Clinton, garnering a
great deal of press interest.  Time will tell if the fawning press and
nation fall for Clintonï¿½s phony August 17th apology.  A number of
women have provided credible evidence that Clinton is a sexual
predator.  It would be fitting if that is what brings him down,
considering that he used allegations that David Koresh had
committed sexual crimes to excuse the BATF/FBI murders of 82
men, women and children.  (Check my web page  around August
25st for photos from the convention.)

Government plans war games to battle Millennium Bug
  By Lisa Hoffman / Scripps Howard News Service
 WASHINGTON -- The federal government is
   gearing up for top-level war games designed to
   grapple with possible calamities the "millennium bug"
   might wreak in the United States and abroad.
 The "tabletop exercise," as it's being called, will
   mark the first time since the end of the Cold War that
   Cabinet secretaries have assembled to plot responses
   to what could be a nationwide crisis.
 Clinton administration officials say they expect any
   disruptions that might result from computer confusion
   when 2000 dawns will be minor. But they want to
   make sure the government is prepared should that
   forecast be wrong.
 Planning for the war games, tentatively scheduled
   for June, is in its early stages, so officials can't say
   which Cabinet secretaries will take part, how long the
   exercises will last or what mock disaster scenarios the
   leaders will be wrestling with.
 According to administration officials, those almost
   certain to participate are Defense Secretary William
   Cohen, Health and Human Services Secretary Donna
   Shalala, Attorney General Janet Reno, Energy
   Secretary Bill Richardson, Transportation Secretary
   Rodney Slater and Jamie Lee Witt, the director of the
   Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is
   taking a lead role in preparing for any year 2000, or Y2K, glitches.
 Governments, from the city and county level up, are racing to make sure
   tens of thousands of vital systems will not fall prey to a
programming problem
   that might cause computers to misinterpret the turn of the century on
Jan. 1,
   2000, and shut down or otherwise fail.
 Given the proliferation of computer chips in everything from traffic
signals to
   medical devices to air traffic control towers, significant
disruptions in vital
   services are at least theoretically possible.
 The administration wants to be able to respond rapidly if those occur.
   major focus of the war games is expected to be on how to coordinate a
   response.
 At least one other high-level war game is slated at the Pentagon, where
   top brass along with Cohen will gather to brainstorm sometime between
   and the national exercise in June, according to Pentagon officials.
 Their focus won't be so much on handling defense computer foul-ups --
   which a massive preparatory fix now is underway -- as on how the
armed forces
   might be able to help communities in which they are based cope with a
   particularly those overseas.
 If, for instance, the electrical power fails in Ramstein, Germany,
troops at the
   U.S. Air Force Base there could provide generators to help restore
the power,
   officials said.

PANIC IN THE YEAR ZERO
U.N. plans for global chaos
Bennett says no plans in U.S. for martial law
Editor's note: This is the second of a two-part series
on the Y2K millennium bug based on an exclusive
interview with Sen. Robert Bennett, R-UT, and the
chairman of the Senate committee investigating the
technology problem.
By David M. Bresnahan
ï¿½ 1998, WorldNetDaily.com
SALT LAKE CITY, UT -- As preparations for
widespread global panic and disorder over the Y2K crisis
begin at the United Nations, the U.S. senator considered
the most knowledgeable about the millennium bug,
assures the United States does not have plans in place for
martial law.
Representatives from 130 nations met in a closed-door
meeting Friday to discuss the Y2K crisis and the
predicted problems that will occur around the world. The
use of SWAT teams and martial law are being planned,
according to a source present for the meeting at the U.N.
Many underdeveloped nations expressed concern
because they have had no ability to prepare for the Y2K
problems, and many other smaller nations are far behind
where they should be, the source told WorldNetDaily.
The discussions at the meeting turned to how to handle
public panic and unrest that is expected to result on
January 1, 2000, if the Y2K computer bug shuts down
power, communications, and transportation.
The meeting was only the first of many more to come.
Eventually, a formal request may be made to the U.N.
for coordinated military action, according to the source.
Representatives in the meetings openly expressed their
fears of unrest, and voiced a need for martial law, and
the use of military and police SWAT teams.
Meanwhile, Bennett, chairman of the Senate Special
Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem, has
been actively sounding the alarm about domestic
problems that may result because of the computer glitch.
But he says martial law is a minimal threat in the U.S.
"I'm not one of those who think that Bill Clinton will
automatically, or in some diabolical way, try to manipulate
this problem (Y2K) to impose improper force on
anybody," he stated. "I just don't see any indications of
that. Until I see some suggestion that that really is
happening I won't believe that it's under consideration."
Bennett did acknowledge that Canada is formulating
plans to initiate martial law because of Y2K.
"The Canadian armed forces are organized very
differently than American armed forces," explained
Bennett. "We don't have the provision to turn out the
military from the Pentagon in a presidential declaration of
martial law like the Canadians do."
Although Bennett has been personally speaking out about
the reality of the problems that could result from the Y2K
bug, he has begun to tone down his predictions. He
blames some of the fear being generated about the
problem on businesses selling survival and preparedness
"There's no question but that some of the hysteria is being
whipped up by people who have products to sell," Bennett
told WorldNetDaily in an exclusive interview. "At the
same time, there are people who have legitimate products
to sell that could have an impact on the Y2K problem,
who have every right to talk about the problem in their
legitimate marketing efforts."
"Sometimes the lines between those two get blurred, but I
don't want to be party to helping sell any particular
product or service. That's not the appropriate thing for a
United States senator or a United States Senate
committee to do."
Bennett was critical of most government agencies and
private businesses for not working on the problem sooner.
He said the Social Security Administration is to be
commended for getting an early start, but most others
failed to work on the problem soon enough to solve it in
The total cost to fix the Y2K bug is expected to exceed
$600 billion, with legal expenses in excess of $1 trillion,
according to Bennett. Those numbers do not include
estimates of lost business revenues, and corresponding
loss of tax revenues. Potential damages and repairs are
also not part of the estimates.
Of all government agencies, Bennett said his greatest
concerns are with the Defense Department. He said the
Pentagon began work on the problem too late.
Bennett listed the priorities of his committee as power,
telecommunications and transportation. He explained that
it will do little good for businesses to fix the Y2K problem
within their company if they don't have power,
communications, or transportation.
"If there is no electricity, it doesn't matter whether your
computer is Y2K compliant or not," said Bennett. "Your
laptop batteries won't last long enough to solve all your
When Bennett first began spreading the alarm about
Y2K, he stated that there was a 40 percent chance the
nation's power grid would not function because of Y2K.
"Now I think that 40 percent has shrunk down to single
digits -- 5 percent, 3 percent -- pick your number, it
doesn't really matter, it's a relatively small chance that the
power grid will fail," said Bennett confidently.
"I still think we will have brownouts," he added. "I don't
know how long they will last. I don't know where they
will hit, and I don't know how severe they will be. The
very nature of the problem indicates that we cannot get
through this with complete, absolute, 100 percent
assurance, although there are people in power companies
that are now telling me that's what we can depend on.
"My own sense of the thing says, no, there's got to be
some brownouts. There will be some interruptions, but
the power grid will not fail. Don't go out and dig up your
backyard and bury propane tanks, or go out and buy your
very own generator, because I think we will have
"I think the telecommunications system will work,"
predicted Bennett. "There will be individual exchanges or
switching companies, or what have you, that will have
problems. We won't know until we can test the whole
system end to end. But there are enough heartening
indications that things are going to be alright that leads me
to believe that the telecommunications system will work."
The nation's power grid is also dependent on a
telecommunications system which enables all the various
computers to communicate and keep the grid functioning.
The telecommunications systems depend on the power
grid to provide the necessary electricity.
"If we have a breakdown in the transportation system, it
could eventually shut down the economy by itself," said
Bennett. "For example, if the trains don't work because
the switching systems don't work, you can't get coal from
coal mines on the trains to the power-generating plants,
which means eventually you don't get any power and the
power grid goes down and then the dominoes can fall in
various directions."
The most vulnerable transportation system which may be
interrupted is maritime shipping, according to Bennett.
"Getting oil out of foreign countries onto ships through
customs with all the paper work that is involved with all
large transoceanic shipments. And, of course, all of the
paper work is controlled by computers," explained
Ships are computer-operated and must dock in ports that
are also computer mechanized. Customs procedures are
also dependent on computers to deal with the enormous
amount of cargo coming into the country every day.
"A breakdown (could occur) in that kind of transportation
chain which depends not only on Y2K compliance in this
country, but in many countries including the countries that
license the ships, and the countries where the oil is
produced," Bennett said. "I think the chances of a
breakdown somewhere in that chain are probably higher
than the single digits, and that could create some
interesting and challenging economic difficulties."
Bennett also took time to give advice to those who wish
to determine how they may be impacted personally by the
Y2K problem. Many people are planning to take their
money out of banks prior to the start of the year 2000.
Bennett is not personally concerned about access to his
bank account.
"You have every right to contact your institution, whether
it's a bank or a credit union, and ask, 'Are you going to be
Y2K compliant?' If you don't have the answer that you
deserve, then take your money out," said Bennett.
He said there will be individual banking institutions where
checks will not clear and ATMs will fail. Some banks and
ATMs will work, and others may not.
"You have the responsibility to take care of your Year
2000 problem, just as your bank has the responsibility to
take care of theirs, or just as Bill Clinton has the
responsibility to take care of America's," he explained.
Despite his own sometimes-dire warnings, Bennett says
no one should have fear.
"I think fear is too strong a word, but I think all of us
should have some concern," he explained. "Concern
enough to inform ourselves. You need to find out as
much as you possibly can about what's really going to
happen to you, and then make intelligent contingency
He advises talking to city, county, and state officials to
determine if local government is prepared to continue to
provide services in the year 2000. Bennett also advises
that everyone should contact businesses they depend on
for goods and services, and evaluate to what extent they
will be impacted by Y2K.
The task is complicated by the need to evaluate the entire
chain of supplies. It is not enough ask your local grocery
store if it is Y2K compliant. It must also be determined if
the chain of supplies to the grocery store will be able to
continue to deliver goods.
"The contingency plan may be very minor, it may be
non-existent," said Bennett. "You may say, 'In my job,
with my employer, in my city, everything is going to be
fine, I don't need to worry about anything.'
"Or you may say, 'Where I live there is a 20 percent, 30
percent chance that the trucks might not be able to get to
the supermarket where I buy food. I probably ought to
have a little extra food. In my city the water purification
plant is proving to be far more troublesome than it would
be someplace else, and in my city I better have a supply
of fresh water that can take me through while they're
trying to get this taken care of.'
"That's not fear," explained Bennett, "that's intelligent
planning based on sound information. Everyone of us has
to take the responsibility for gathering his or her own
information and then making personal decisions.

@_subject: Y2K Privatization Opportunities 
Whatever the extent of Y2K related problems that actually develops, there is one
thing for certain: The private sector will be up and running smoothly before much
of the government sector.  Y2K will be a fantastic opportunity to promote and
achieve privatization. So let's start planning for taking advantage of that
opportunity and stop arguing about how bad it will or will not be.
Somebody want to start the "Y2K Privatization Coalition"??
