@_subject: This list and a question 
I just joined this list last week, I may have been greviously mistaken, but I thought that this list talked about technical issues of being a cypherpunk.  It seems to me that most of the things posted here belong is a newsgroup rather than in my mailbox.  So I guess the question is:
Is there a cypherpunk newsgroup, and if there isn't why?  I am not complaining so much about the content, but I get so many mail messages about things that I would just as soon miss in my mail box that I have a hard time finding the messages that I do want.  Just a thought. . . . Hey and is there some sort of FAQ?

I think I am a more enlightened individual now.  First thing when I get back into FTP land I get the FAQ (cool faq name BTW).  I was not intending to criticize, it just seemed to be alot more flamish than I expected and I guess that is what expecting things does.

@_subject: another factoring thing. . . . 
Hey did anyone see the artical, some time ago in Science News (May 14,
1994) their was this artical on using a 'quantum computer'.  Through
the marvels of quantum mechanics it is theroretically possible to build a computer that would be really good at factoring large numbers
such as the ones used in RSA.  This combined with team sieving could
possibly be used to signifigantly reduce the time required to factor a key.  Any thougts, did anyone else see the artical, has there already
been a really stimulating discusion that I missed?  Well let me know.
