@_subject: DNS queries 
Thanx 4 da help, but it isnt the answer to ma question.
I tray to know, ..... All the pc's on Internet use a server (Remote o
local ; named ,etc ) that resolve the queries 4 non ip's domains, like
4 example    200.37.129.2 ---- use 207.17.220.2 to resolve the queries
(of the domains ) in internet.
I like to know if there be a program that say me Remotly that
200.37.129.2 use 207.17.220.2 to resolve the domain ( 4 da Internet )
Best wishes
