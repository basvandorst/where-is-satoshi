Traditionally you can use an expired beta to connect to Netscape and
download a new version.  I would test this, but it wouldn't work
because the clock on the downloading machine has to be in sink with
the server.

I don't believe this is correct.  They send you information after you
have created the cert verifying that you set it up, but nothing
requires a response and the key is transfered via http.
