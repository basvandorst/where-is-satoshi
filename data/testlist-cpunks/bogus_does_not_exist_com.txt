Here is some code to run on a SparcStaion (I or II) to generate random
numbers based on noise from the audio chip.  I have not tested the true
randomness of the out but cause I don't know how.  Thus if anyone can
please do and send me the results.  I suppose some minor tweeking can be
made for the mid range gain for a better spread. unfortunatly there is no way to turn off the u-law audio compression
the chip uses to outputs data if you plot the out put you will see the
problem the compression caused.

@_subject: Problems of anonymous posts 
(This is from Hal; I still can't post from Portal.)
After going to enormous efforts to create a network of anonymous remailers,
we are hoist by our own petard, as our list receives strange, irrelevant,
and argumentative posts through our own anonymous remailers.  (Not all
anonymous posts are like this, but there have been quite a few in the last
few weeks which fall into these categories.)
This should challenge us to reconsider the value of anonymity and remailers.
Are we working only to make the net safe for the immature and incoherent?
I would say not, but these posts should remind us of how incomplete is the
infrastructure needed for successful use of anonymity.
A brief recap of the benefits of anonymous mail: presently, on the net,
all mail is tagged with the sender and destination.  This means that not
only the recipient, but any net snoopers and sysops at systems through
which the mail passes, may be able to know that person A is sending mail
to person B.  This kind of information can be used to build up dossiers
of who talks to whom.
Worse, as we move into an era of electronic commerce, more and more of our
lives may begin to take place on the net.  We may shop, find entertainment,
do business, even work for a living across the network.  This will open up
even more opportunities for collecting data about how we live our lives.
In my opinion, the best way to preserve our privacy is to make it impossible
to collect this data.  Anonymous remailers, and their cousins, IP bouncers
(which perform an analogous function for telnet-type connections), can
prevent the collection of this kind of information by hiding exactly who is
communicating with whom.  These services can serve as the basis for the
other privacy-protecting technologies we've been discussing, such as digital
cash.  There's not much point in using digital cash to prevent tieing
customers to vendors if monitoring the net will provide that information
This isn't just a futuristic concern, either.  Already today the government
is taking steps which could, under some not-so-far-fetched extrapolations,
get people on the list in trouble.  Many people on this list have communicated
with Phil Zimmermann, for example.  What if email logs were used to track
all those people down, and they became suspects in this criminal investigation
that the government seems to be pursuing?
It's not even impossible that the government could someday try to paint the
cypherpunks themselves as a subversive organization.  Think how much more
difficult any such diabolical attack would be if people subscribed to the
list via remailers, under digital pseudonyms.  These days, with the shaky
legal status of cryptography, we of all people should be able to see the
benefits of anonymous communication.
The problem is, then, how to gain the benefits of anonymity, while avoiding
the abuses.  One solution which we have long discussed is reputations and
pseudonyms; another is making people pay to use remailers.
The way reputations work is that people would digitally sign their anonymous
postings.  This way someone could post anonymously and build up a reputation
by means of a series of postings signed under the same name.  As time went
on, they would no more want to damage the reputation of their pseudonym
than they would want to damage their reputation under non-anonymous posting.
To make this work, people need to be able to easily filter their mail
on the basis of the pseudonym it came from, rather than the (irrelevant)
anonymous remailer which sent it.  Then they can choose to accept and read
mail from anonymous posters who have built up a good reputation while
ignoring that from those who have ruined their good (pseudo) name.
Karl Barrus has done some experiments along these lines.  He described
some time back a system he had for working with the elm mail reader,
one of the most common Unix-based mail agents.  The software will display
the true originator of PGP-signed posts (anonymous or not).  This allows
readers to apply the same standards to signed anonymous mail as to regular
mail.  It raises anonymous posters to the same level, and holds them to
the same standards, as other posters.  This software could allow anonymous
posters to build up their reputations, encouraging more responsibility on
their part.
The other solution, pay-for-use remailers, has also been pioneered by
Karl.  His idea is to make the remailer a little harder to use by forcing
the user to include some digital postage (based, I think, on what Tim May
called "poor man's postage stamps").  This could help reduce the volume
of anonymous mail and make it less likely that joke or trivial messages
would be posted.  (We could even consider applying Karl's approach to
the list as a whole; people would have to apply ahead of time for posting
tokens in order to post.  This might force people to take a little more
care and time in their postings.)
I don't think Karl's efforts have been sufficiently appreciated here.
He is quietly working to create the tools needed to allow anonymity to
be a useful and important part of the net architecture rather than the
annoying sideshow that it sometimes seems to be becoming.  We need to
support Karl, work to bring his innovations into other remailers and other
mail agents, if we want to gain the benefits from what we have done so far.

I think the problem here is the amount of time which would be taken
by the moderator.  If you were going to go this route, you might as
well have a completely moderated list.  This slows down list turnaround
and is a lot of work for somebody.
I'm not sure what you mean here.  Perhaps you are talking about someone
who posts saying, "Hi, this is Bill Gates, I just joined your list, and
here's my PGP key, I'll just be posting through these anonymous remailers
for now.  Oh, and to prove it's really me, my annual salary is such-and-
such, which you can confirm by reading the most recent annual report from
Microsoft."  This wouldn't fool anyone for an instant.
Or, someone posts and says, "My name is Deadbeat, here is my PGP key, and
I'll just be posting through anon remailers," then he does so for months
on end.  This also doesn't "fool" anybody, but does represent an ID which
can get established and become as legitimate as other ID's on the net -
in a sense, a "Fake ID"; this is what we call a digital pseudonym.

@_subject: Detecting double-spending (long) 
For those of you who slogged through my description last week of Chaum's
"simple" digital cash which detects double-spending, I've realized on
further thought that a simplification is possible.  Writing that long
essay improved my own understanding of his system.
Recall that the double-spending cash is the product, for i from 0 to
k/2, of f(xi,yi)^(1/3), mod the bank's public modulus.  f() is a one-way
function, one which can't be inverted.  xi and yi were a little complicated,
and here is where my simplification comes in.
Let xi be g(ai), where ai is a random number and g is a one-way function.
Let yi be g(ai xor ), where  is Alice's identifying information,
her account number.  Normally the ai "blinds" that since it is random
and it is xor'd onto it.  But if ever both ai and ai xor  are known,
 is revealed and Alice's goose is cooked.
Everything else works as Chaum suggested; I have just eliminated his ci
and di random numbers.  In his proposal, g took two arguments, and ci and
di were appended for the xi and yi cases.  But I'm convinced now that
these are unnecessary for our purposes.
The purpose for ci and di are to provide "unconditional" anonymity to
Alice if she doesn't cheat.  Look what happens with my simpler system.
She tells Bob ai and yi for certain i's.  Now, g is a one-way function,
but suppose Bob had a big enough computer to try all possible arguments
to g.  Sooner or later he'd find a value Z for which g(Z) was yi.  So
then he could figure that Z equals ai xor , and he knows ai, so
he could find .  This means that in my simplified system Alice
is depending on Bob (and everyone else) being unable to crack g() in
order to stay anonymous.
Chaum's system is better.  By having a g with two arguments he creates
a huge number of solutions to g(Z1,Z2) = yi.  There is no way for Bob to
tell which one is right, so even with infinite computing resources he
can't crack Alice's anonymity.
My thought is, unconditional anonymity is really no better than
computational anonymity in the real world.  Eric Hughes often says
"all cryptograpy is economics".  In practice, beyond a certain point,
anonymity would not be broken by a direct computational attack, but rather
by other means - bribery, theft, etc.  In the real world there is no such
thing as "unconditional" anonymity.  In practice, computational anonymity
is enough.
So my feeling is that for implementation purposes the ci and di in Chaum's
system can be removed, simplifying the protocols somewhat, at the cost
of reducing Alice's anonymity from unconditional to computational.

@_subject: your mailRe: on anonymity, identity, reputation, and spoofing 
I do sympathize with L. Detweiler's concern about multiple identities.
Human nature being what it is, if a series of posts appears quickly taking
one view, people who disagree may think, well, I guess I'm in the minority
on this, I won't make a stink about it.  That's just part of the herd
instinct, which, IMO, we all share.  The lesson is that it is even more
important on the net not to be afraid to take unpopular stands.  You may
find that there are more people who agree with you than you thought.
In particular, although I think Detweiler's posts could be tightened
up considerably, and I don't agree with his solutions in detail, I can
understand his paranoia, having shared it from time to time.
There are some possible technological solutions to some of the issues
raised.  Chaum, in his 1985 CACM paper, describes how "credentials" can
be exchanged among various pseudonyms a person may have.  A credential
can basically be any statement by a 3rd party about a person.  It could
be a statement by a college that he had a certain degree.  It could be
a statement by a government that he had a driver's license.  It could be
a statement by a business that he was an agent for that business.
The credential would be given to the person, then Chaum shows how it
could be re-blinded and shown under other pseudonyms.  The credential
can be verified, but it can't be linked to the True Name or other pseudonyms
of the holder.
We could think about using something like this for reputations.  Take
Nick's question about how a new pseudonym could get through the filters.
Maybe the person posts under his real name for a while, then some respected
person is willing to give him a "valued poster" credential.  He can
re-blind this credential and submit it with posts he starts to make under
his pseudonym.  People will know that the pseudonymous poster is at least
potentially capable of making sense, and give his words some weight.  But
there will be no connection to his True Name.
(Of course, this could lead occasionally to a Dr. Jekyll who makes
sensible and weighty posts under his own name, while under his Mr. Hyde
pseudonym he rants and raves.  But hopefully this would not happen too
Other credentials could be related to some of the other points Detweiler
raised, such as list membership > some number of months.  The point would
be that these credentials are voluntary, used to get past people's filters,
and that they retain poster anonymity while giving readers useful information
about the poster.
It's ironic that L. Detweiler, who has played a major part in spreading
awareness of Cypherpunks technology through his widely read Privacy and
Anonymity FAQ, is suggesting that people should be limited in their
use of this technology.  Still, the concerns he raises are going to be
shared by many people, and we should try to be ready with technological
solutions that are consistent with privacy protection.

   Yes, but the positional accuracy required (on the order of the
   wavelength) would be prohibitive to achieve. (Such things may be
   possible for the NRO's DSP (more acronym overloading: DSP stands for
   Defense Support Program) satellites to implement. I haven't heard any
   speculations that this is actually being done.)
   Synthetic Aperture Radar is feasible becuase the wavelengths are so
   much larger.
   The new Keck Telescope will eventually use a second telescope, now
   under construction, located some distance away, for very long baseline
   interferometry...I have no idea if it can be made to work as an actual
   synthetic aperture. Jay Freeman man know.
I wasn't thinking so much of interferometry techniques (although my
reference to synthetic radar certainly implies them), but rather something
on the order of a filter which might work (independent of the wavelength
of light) as follows:
Take, for example, the square box pixellation (is this the right word
here?) used to blot out people's faces on TV sometimes. Put a long
(preferably continuous) series of images into the computer, and build
a model of the movement of the person's head (the camera isn't
perfectly still; assume that the person, however, does stay
still). Use the data about how adjacent pixels change over time to
improve the model of what the person's face really looks like.
This is independent of the wavelength of light -- it does of course
depend on the resolution of the square pixels used to blot the peron's
face, but not particularly on the wavelength or resolution of the
camera (assuming it is much better than the square blotches).
I first noticed this effect watching Court TV's coverage of the
William Kennedy Smith rape trial (I was home sick at the time), while
the victim testified. I felt that as the person (and camera) moved
around, I could gradually form a better opinion of what the person
looked like than just provided by the square blotches, by noting when
and how the (macro-)pixels changed.
Of course, just filtering a single frame would be better than looking
at the sharp-edged squares. I'm talking about averaging all these
filtered images over time, compensating for movement of the camera and
subject. It would seem to me that over long enough time, perhaps using
more sophisticated mathematics than just averaging (although just plain
averaging seems like the right operation here), if there was actually
enough movement to provide enough resolution, you could eventually get
to a real photographic-quality image of the person.
This process might be similar to CAT scans, where a lot of
low-resolution "pictures" are combined to create a high-resolution
image, except the distribution would be temporal rather than spatial.
I think is relevant to c'punks, because it involves decryption of
an encrypted signal (recovering the face of a person when it was
intentionally distorted). Does this mean that if people like Court
TV really want to blur people's faces, they need to add crypto-secure
noise instead of just averaging the micro-pixels into macro-pixels?
I think so!
and also
I also thought the license plate joke was definately relevant to
c'punks, because it was actually a code, where the cleartext domain
was conceptual rather than textual, just like this mail talks about a
domain in 2-space (or 3-space) images, rather than text. Also, the
fact that the "plaintext" was actually a pun involving multiple coding
schemes made it relevant to this list also IMHO. Also, I think short
humor is appropriate for any list, at least if it is both funny and
computer-related, but I admit that may be stretching it for some here.
I assume that coding (as distinguished from ciphering) is indeed relevant to
this list...

@_author:  
@_subject: Remailer chaining results 
I've done some calculations on the mixing properties of Chaum-style
networks and gotten some interesting results.
Recall that in a Chaum-type remailer network users use nested
encryption and remailing instructions to set up a chain or "cascade"
of remailers.  Each remailer strips off the encryption envelope and
sees the address of the next remailer in the chain or, for the final
remailer, the ultimate destination.  All messages are the same size
and carry no distinguishing features.  We assume that the opponent is
monitoring all messages traffic into and out of all remailers on the
net but can't see what is happening within each remailer.
Let's take a concrete example and suppose there are four remailers.
Everyone sets up a chain of 2 remailers, chosen at random from these
four.  A batch of messages is received by each remailer, which strips
off the envelope and sends them on to the next remailer in the chain,
where they are mixed with the other messages which chose that remailer
as the 2nd in the chain, then sent out to their ultimate destinations.
This model is a little artificial in that we are assuming a certain
amount of synchrony of the operation of the various remailers for
simplicity.  (Note that for this four-node network there are twelve
possible two-node chains where the nodes are different.)
There are three measures that I am interested in: bandwidth used (the
less the better); message mixing (the more the better); and immunity
to subversion (the more the better).  For bandwidth we can measure the
flow through the remailer.  Due to the symmetry of the situation, the
inflow and outflow are equal and the same for all remailers.  Message
flows per remailer are the sum of the flow into the remailer from
outside (the user messages), plus all flows into the remailer from the
other remailers.  Mixing can be measured by a probability distribution
over the outgoing messages which represents how likely they are to be
a given incoming message.  For simplicity this can be expressed simply
as the number M of messages which are equally likely to be the
original (in an earlier message I used entropy which is a log measure
of the same thing).  I am thinking of measuring immunity to subversion
in terms of how much mixing is lost by a certain number of "failed"
(that is, subverted) nodes.  Some networks are vulnerable to "single
point failures", where a single subverted node destroys all the
anonymity.  A more robust network would require multiple failures for
this to happen.  However, it turns out that even in a multiple-failure
network a single-point failure may reveal some information about the
messages, which we can express as a loss in mixing.
Let the total message bandwidth into the network be N packets per time
unit.  Due to symmetry, each node will receive N/4 packets.  With the
chains as defined above, the other three nodes will all be equally
likely to be the 2nd in the chain, so N/12 packets are sent to each of
them.  Simultaneously, N/12 packets come to this node from each of the
others.  This is a total internode bandwidth of N/4 in each direction
per node, or N total per direction.  Add this internode bandwidth to
the user-link bandwidth of N per direction and we get 2N total, or N/2
per node.
At the beginning of each chain, we have N/4 packets come in and get
mixed as each node.  As the packets go out, they are sent to the other
three remailers, and when they leave they may be any of the output of
those three.  Thus they are equally likely to be any of 3N/4 of the
packets, and this is the amount of mixing we have.
If one of the two nodes in your remailer chain is compromised, it
provides no effective mixing.  This means that your message is only
mixed at one node, where it is combined as part of a batch of N/4, so
that is the degree of mixing you have with a single failure.  If both
remailers are compromised then of course you have no mixing, which we
would write as a factor of 1 in uncertainty increase.
This can also be expressed in terms of a percentage compromise of the
network.  If 1 node is compromised, which can be represented as p=.25,
then the six of the twelve remailer paths which use that node will
have single-point failures with the comcomitant reduction in mixing.
In other words, half of the messages will have the full 3N/4 mixing
while half have N/4.  With p=.50, two nodes are compromised.  Two
paths are safe, eight have single failures, and two have
double-failures.  So we have 1/6 of the messages with 3N/4, 2/3 with
N/4, and 1/6 with only 1 mixing.  With p=.75, three nodes compromised,
there are no safe paths; half have single failures and half have
double.  So 1/2 the messages have mixing of N/4 and half have 1.  And
of course with p=1 all messages are compromised with mixing factor 1.
Let me just go on and extend this analysis in one way.  In the
discussion of the chains, we have assumed that the two nodes in the
chain would be different.  Logically though one could have chains
where both nodes were the same.  Let us compare this network with the
one we just did.
There are now 16 possible chains.  Total bandwidth is somewhat less
(since we don't count the messages which stay in one remailer).  Now
only 3/4 of the messages from each node need to get exchanged.  Per
node, there will be N/4 messages to users and 3N/16 messages to other
nodes, for a total of 7N/16 per node or 7N/4 total (above the 7's were
8's).  Mixing is actually improved; there is no limitation on which
input messages might map to which output ones, so we have full N-fold
mixing (compared to 3N/4 above).  With single-point failure mixing is
again N/4 as above.
The failure behavior is quite different.  With p=.25, 1 of the 16
paths is totally compromised, 6 of the 16 have single failures for N/4
mixing, and 9 of the 16 have no failures for N mixing.  With p=.50,
4/16 of the paths have mixing 1, 8/16 have mixing N/4, and 4/16 have
mixing N.  With p=.75, 9/16 have mixing 1, 6/16 have N/4, and 1/16
have N.
It's not clear what measure is useful to compare these failure
situations.  A double-point failure seems much worse than a single
one.  I wonder whether taking a geometric mean (which would be
equivalent to taking the arithmetic mean of the entropies) would be
valid.  If we did that for the p=.25 case, we get average mixing of
.59N^(15/16) for the self-chain network, and .27N for the network
where all chains are two different nodes.  For N less than about
250,000 packets per (network-wide) batch the self-chain network
provides superior average mixing in the p=.25 case by this measure.
Sparing the math, for p=.50 the self-chain network is superior for
batch sizes smaller than 29 packets, and for p=.75 the self-chain
network is only superior for batch sizes smaller than 16 packets.
This suggests that if the network is likely to be mostly safe then the
extra mixing allowed by same-node chains is worth the small increased
risk of exposure.  But as the chance of encountering bad nodes rises
it becomes unwise to take this chance.
Here is a quick summary of the extension of these results to larger
numbers of remailers and longer chains.  Let there be R remailers and
let the chain length be K.  Let the number of message packets per
batch (network wide) again be N.  (I will neglect the differences
between same-node chains and different-node chains as they are
generally small effects on the order of 1/R.)
Bandwidth per node is approximately KN/R.  Network wide it is
therefore KN.  Adding remailer hops increases network bandwidth loads
directly in proportion to the number of hops.  Mixing is approximately
N for K=2 and up, which is the maximum possible.  For K=1 mixing is
Fault tolerance is interesting.  A K-length cascade is invulnerable to
up to K-2 failures!  At K-1 the mixing decreases from N to N/R, a
significant decrease.  And with K failures of course the mixing drops
to 1.  I was surprised how robust these networks are.  The reason is
that with even K-2 compromised remailers in a K-length cascade there
still remains a safe length 2 cascade, and as we saw above that provides
N-fold mixing.
This provides some guidelines on the choice of K.  First, K should
clearly be at least 2.  The increase from K=1 to K=2 increases mixing
from N/R to N, a considerable increase.  Secondly, K should probably
be at least 3.  This will provide full mixing even if you are unlucky
enough to choose a compromised remailer.  Beyond this, you can
calculate that with a chain length of K and probability p of a
compromised node, the expected number of compromised nodes in your
chain is Kp.  This suggests that you should choose K large enough that
Kp is well below K-2.  If you estimate p=.50, for example, you might
choose K=8.  The binomial theorem states that the chance of x failures
out of k nodes where the probability of each failure is p is
(p^x)*((1-p)^(k-x))*k!/x!(k-x)!.  In this example, the chance of 7
failures out of 8 is about 3% and the chances of 8/8 is about .5% for
a total risk of 3.5% that you won't be fully protected.
Now, how many people read this far? ;-)

@_subject: More on remailer chaining 
I have one small addition to the analysis I did yesterday of remailer
chaining effects.  Previously I was assuming that there was a uniform
distribution of messages across remailers, so that all saw the same
number of packets.  How does this change if some remailers are used
more than others?
Again I will sneak up on the problem by taking a concrete example.
Suppose there are two remailers and that we are using two-remailer
chains which include the possibility of using the same remailer twice.
Suppose one of the remailers is used much more than the other.  Take
an extreme case, where remailer 1 is used 90% of the time and remailer
2 is used 10% of the time.  If we suppose that these probabilities
affect both the choice of the first and second remailer in the chain,
then the four possible chains have the following frequencies of use:
1,1   81%
1,2    9%
2,1    9%
2,2    1%
Notice that this also implies that 90% of the messages enter the net
at remailer 1 and 10% at 2, and also that 90% leave via 1 and 10%
leave via 2.
Now, ignoring for a moment the fact that there may be some reason
people are shunning 2 (they suspect it is compromised, or it is
unreliable, or something - but maybe it's just new and a lot of people
haven't heard about it yet), what is the safest way to use this
The key, I believe, is to imitate the observed statistics in your own
choice of a chain, at least for the 2nd hop.  90% of the messages
coming out of the first stage of either remailer will go to remailer
1.  If you want your message to be lost most effectively among the
others, you should choose remailer 1 as your own 2nd hop 90% of the
time.  This way your message will be 9 times more likely to go to 1
than 2, but since there is 9 times the traffic going to 1 than to 2 it
will be perfectly masked.
The result will be that your message is equally likely to be any of
the N messages coming out of the remailer.  Your statistics will match
all of the others.  Therefore, you get a full factor of N mixing with
such an unbalanced network, just as much as you get with a perfectly
symmetrical network - as long as you imitate the network statistics.
The choice of the first remailer in your chain does not appear to be
critical.  We assume the opponent can see which remailer you have
chosen (by tracking your message from your site to the remailer) so
there is no advantage to choosing 1 over 2 as far as secrecy.  You
will get full N-fold mixing in either case.  This is a bit
counter-intuitive; it might seem that choosing 1 is superior to
choosing 2 in terms of mixing.  But look at a specific example:
Suppose 100 messages enter the network, 90 at 1 and 10 at 2.  After
the first step, 9 messages go from 1 to 2 (10% of the 90) and 9
messages go from 2 to 1 (90% of the 10).  Then 90 messages are sent
from 1 and 10 from 2.  Now, if your message entered at 2, but had a
90% probability of going to 1 at the second hop, then there is a 90%
chance that it ended up as one of the 90 messages leaving 1, and a 10%
chance that it ended up as one of the 10 messages leaving 2.  This
tells observers exactly nothing about where your message is.  So
choosing 2 as the first hop is just as good as choosing 1.
Although I have not yet extended these results to longer hops and
larger numbers of remailers, my guess is that the same general rule
will apply there as well.  This suggests that it will be useful and
important to have accurate information about the usage levels of the
various remailers so that you can accurately mimic those
How bad is it if you don't have accurate usage information?  According
to my calculations, in the case of two remailers, if the actual
probabilities of the two remailers being used are p and 1-p, and the
probabilities you use are q and 1-q, the mixing level you get
decreases from N to N * (p/q)^q * ((1-p)/(1-q))^(1-q).  If q=p and you
have accurate information there is no reduction.  In the example
above, with p=.9, if you didn't know this and used q=.5, your mixing
level reduces to N*.6.  This is not a huge reduction even for this
rather extreme case, but I can't guess how this will extend to larger
networks and chains.
Assuming these results do hold true, though, it suggests some
interesting "market" dynamics.  Patterns of usage of the remailers may
tend to be stable since anyone who departs from the current usage
pattern will stand out and hence lose security.  It may be difficult
for new remailers to become established since their initial usage
level will be low, making it risky to use them to any significant
degree.  These considerations are somewhat similar to situations where
there are competing but incompatible standards (e.g. Beta vs VHS
VCR's) in terms of the barriers to entry.
There may also be considerable misinformation about usage levels.  It
will be to the advantage of a site to exaggerate the number of
messages they are handling.  Especially if noise messages are used (a
strategy I haven't tried to analyze yet) it would be easy to generate
bogus statistics.  Maybe some organization could collect statistics by
polling remailer users about their practices rather than believing the
operators, and make that information available.
Another point is that, assuming that remailer operation is actually
going to be profitable some day, there will be advantages to being one
of the first to market.  Getting your remailer widely known and used
in the early days could establish market leadership which will have
considerable staying power just from the inherent properties of how
these networks work.  Heavily-used remailers could charge premium
prices while the "little guys" have to be cut rate in order to grow,
compensating users for the loss of security they will experience.
Maybe this will encourage people to make the investment to become what
Tim May has called "Mom and Pop" remailers.  This might be the golden
opportunity to get in on the ground floor.  For more information, send

@_subject: responce to graphic encryption replies 
First, I would like to address the issue of David C.'s spam of the usenet. Mr. Clavedetcher does not work for nor does he represent us in any way. After receiving word from Cypherpunks that he had spamed the list I personally contacted him and informed him to cease and desist these actions or face legal action. We at PrivaSoft do not conduct nor condone such actions on the Net. During my conversation with him I discovered he was a zealous individual looking to make good on our rebate program, as per our Web page. If you should receive any further spams from him or any other over zealous netuser, Please contact me immediately. Also if you could inform me of other news groups/ lists he spammed so I may contact them as well regarding this. Thanx.
    Second I would like to begin addressing several of the issues raised by my inquiry of Graphic Encryption. Firstly Graphic Encryption is the scrambling of a graphic image using an encryption algorithm. In PrivaSoft's case the Image is that of your document, including all text and graphics contained therein. Syntel Sciences, the distributor of PrivaSoft, does not wish to publish its algorithm at this time, however if there is any question as to the strength of PrivaSoft and its Graphic Encryption engine, I would be happy to post a sample document for you to try and crack. Also, I have recently put together an info sheet on the Security provided by PrivaSoft which I can post if there is interest.     One of the key strengths, as I see it, of graphic encryption is that during decryption via hacking, there is an added time element when a human interface is required to verify the product, ( since it is a graphic picture being produced, regular checksums for intelligible words can't be used sans implementing OCR), even if this is only 10 milliseconds per try this is increases the time to crack exponentially beyond that of a data encrypted document of similar key length and algorithm strength.     Once again I would like to apologize on behalf of Syntel Sciences - PrivaSoft for the nuisance caused by the spam done by David C. and I wish to reiterate that such actions are not condoned by us and will not be tolerated.

Hi! We are delighted to announce a new mailing list, Hackerpunks! This list
is for serious folks who know stuff about computers _AND_ want to keep
their privacy. The submission address is an anonymous alias,
hackerpunks at alpha.c2.org. It is anonymous because _I_ want to keep my
privacy and do NOT want to answer stupid questions. To further _your_
privacy, we can subscribe ONLY anonymous aliases user_name at alpha.c2.org.
Mailing list messages will be forwarded to your alpha.c2.org adresses through anonymous remailers.
This list is UNMODERATED. Due to our organization, we are unable to find out your true identity, and you are unable to find out where
our list-bot resides. So - you can now have free discussion about all
exploits and great hacks! Just use remailers and be safe...
Remember i) no one can find out where the list resides ii) nobody can
find out that your alpha.c2.org account is subscribed to Hackerpunks
iii) nobody can find out who hides behind alpha.c2.org accounts
iv) nobody can find out that you are using alpha.c2.org aliases.
Everything goes as long as it is about hacking. We shall decide later whether we want to keep non-computer hacking discussions in this
list or make another one. MODERATE FLAMAGE ONLY!
Since remailers are used all the way from you to the list-bot and back,
the time for your messages to reach subscribers will be invariably
longer. You've gotta pay for security. Hackers must be patient!
See our .sig for instructions; get premail for Unix or Private Idaho for
Windows, get an anonymous account at alpha.c2.org, and subscribe!

This thread is probably already due for a change in
the Subject line, but I'll leave it untouched for the moment.
[....] And it sums to a very bleak picture, indeed.
Please forgive my naivete, but are there no legal
weapons available to the 'victims' in such cases?
I'm passingly familiar with the Operation Sundevil
fiasco -- i.e., with the outcome re the principal
'charges'.  I'm appalled, however, at the apparent lack of remedies for return of such seized property.
Are individuals who find themselves in such a predicament simply at the government's mercy (there's
an oxymoron for ya)??

@_subject: I Lost 4 lbs. in 4 Days...Without Dieting!!! 
EAT THE FOODS YOU LOVE
NO WILL POWER REQUIRED
Anyone who has struggled to lose weight, like I did, can tell you DIETS ALONE DON'T WORK !  That's because the difference between thin and overweight individuals has more to do with metabolic rate than what they eat.  It's believed most lean individuals have a
metabolism designed to BURN FAT !
We have designed a product that works
several ways to help you achieve maximum
results from your weight-loss program. This
unique blend of herbs, botanicals and Chromium
Picolinate, improves your metabolism so
your body relies more on stored fat and less on stored proteins.
"LOSE THE FAT....
       NOT THE MUSCLE"
Typically, up to 30% of lost weight is
muscle.  This lowers your metabolic rate and
slows calorie-burning.  This lowered metabolic
rate makes it hard to keep lost pounds from
creeping back.  Result: the "Yo-Yo" syndrome
in which weight is repeatedly lost and then regained.  After each lose-gain cycle the portion of fat increases.
To break this vicious cycle, it is important
to lose only fat while maintaining, or even increasing muscle.  Studies show that optimal
chromium nutrition is an effective part of long-term
fat-loss programs.  Our unique formula of specialized herbs and botanicals is coupled with the best source of chromium available,
patented Chromium Picolinate.
HERE'S EVIDENCE !
Several double-blind crossover studies
conducted along with clinical and laboratory
tests at a leading university and hospital have proven that the ingredients in this product are Without changing dietary or exercise
habits, over a six-week period, subjects in separate studies lost an average of 23% body fat or
approximately 4.4 lbs. of fat, and increased lean body mass by 1.5 lbs.
People over the age of 46 did even better,
and women seemed to do the best.  People
with elevated cholesterol levels averaged a 10%
drop in LDL cholesterol.
          WHAT EXACTLY IS       CHROMIUM PICOLINATE?
It's a bioactive chromium with clinically
proven benefits.  Chromium is vital to
good health and is essential for the efficient
functioning of insulin.  Poor responsiveness to insulin is common and is linked with increased
risk of being overweight, heart disease, elevated
blood fat, high blood presure and diabetes.
Over 90% of American diets provide much
less than the minimal amount of chromium
recommended by The National Academy
of Science.  Most forms of chromium are not
easily absorbed by the body, but chromium
picolinate, being bioactive, is easily absorbed.
In fact, it has been shown to reduce body fat,
lower cholesterol and even reduce elevated
block-sugar in diabetics.
THE DIET BREAKTHRU OF THE CENTURY !!
"Over the last 10 years, I have tried a variety of weight loss methods, spent thousands of dollars and failed at all of them.  By December 1995, I
was the heaviest I had ever weighed-235 lbs.
I had no energy.  My self-esteem had hit rock
bottom... I was introduced to Thermo Lift and have never looked back! My energy level has
boosted and my weight loss increased... In total
I have lost 70 lbs. and went from a size 22 to a
size 12.  The most amazing part - It's So Easy!"

washboard stomach.  By the end of the eighth week
all I could see were solid stomach muscles!  I

abilities."   Chris

@_subject: Bush Gang Suspected In Assault On PresidencyBush Gang Suspected In Assault On Presidency 
Bush gang suspected in new assault on Presidency
by Edward Spannaus and Jeffrey Steinberg
In the midst of the worst global financial crisis in modern history, the
United States Presidency has come under renewed, vicious attack from a
combination of British and nominally ``American'' Bush-League circles.
This latest attack, which one White House official long ago
appropriately dubbed ``bimbo eruptions,'' centered around a Bush
``mole'' who was, unfortunately, allowed to operate inside the Clinton
administration, and who now enjoys high-level security clearances in her
post at the Pentagon.
Linda Tripp, the central player in the renewed assault against President
Clinton--staged around a purported sex scandal involving a young White
House intern, Monica Lewinsky--was a Bush administration employee from
1990, until Bush left office in January 1993. At the urging of senior
Bush administration officials, including Transportation Secretary Sam
Skinner, Tripp was retained by the Clinton-Gore transition team in a
clerical position, and later assigned to work at the Office of the White
House General Counsel, under Bernard Nussbaum and his deputy, Vincent
Foster. All the while, she was operating as part of a treasonous
Bush-League ``fifth column'' within the Executive branch.
While the ``Get Clinton'' media have attempted to portray Tripp as
``apolitical,'' she was, in fact, an ally, from the Bush administration
period on, of then-FBI agent Gary Aldrich, who, in 1996, wrote a
libellous book against President Clinton, {Unlimited Access: An FBI
Agent Inside the Clinton White House,} which also revolved around bogus
claims of White House sexual misconduct (see {EIR,} July 26, 1996,
p.|72.) Aldrich was another Bush-League mole inside the Clinton White
House. His embarrassingly fantasy-ridden book has been trumpetted by the
London-based Hollinger Corporation, the leading British Crown media
cartel; by its subsidiary, {American Spectator} magazine; and by ``Get
Clinton'' money-bags Richard Mellon Scaife.
Tripp emerged in 1995 as an asset of Whitewater Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr, testifying before the Whitewater grand jury and later
before a Congressional hearing on the death of Vincent Foster. When
Lloyd Cutler replaced Nussbaum as White House General Counsel, Tripp,
who by then had been widely identified as an unabashed political enemy
of President Clinton, was reassigned to the Pentagon, where she
eventually got an $80,000-a-year job, which also involved her getting
top-level security clearances. Tripp claimed, to anyone who would
listen, that she had been transferred from the White House because she
``knew too much about Whitewater,'' a patent lie.
Commenting on the role of Tripp as the linchpin in the latest
Clintongate assault, Lyndon LaRouche called on Jan. 22 for Tripp's
security clearances to be immediately revoked, pending the outcome of a
thorough probe of her role in the sordid affair. ``She obviously needs
her security clearances immediately pulled, given her role in what has
all the earmarks of an illegal attack against the President, ostensibly
on behalf of partisan Republican forces. I would certainly hope that
there is no one in the Pentagon who would countenance such an obvious
assault against a vital American institution, the Presidency. I would
expect such treachery from the editorial page writers at the {Wall
Street Journal,} but not from our military.''
               - An earlier `eruption' -
In the summer of 1997, Tripp surfaced again as part of an effort to hit
President Clinton with a ``Profumo''-style sex scandal, telling
{Newsweek} that the President had sexually harassed a White House aide,
Kathleen Willey. Willey denied, under oath, that Tripp's allegations
were true. This prompted President Clinton's attorney, Robert Bennett,
belatedly, in August 1997, to denounce Tripp as a liar.
While working at the Pentagon, in late 1996, Tripp had already begun to
cultivate a close relationship with a former White House junior staff
aide, 22-year-old Monica Lewinsky, who had been recently transferred to
the Defense Department. It is unclear how the two women came to meet,
but in short order, Tripp began to exert a significant amount of control
over the younger woman. Tripp should be forced, under oath, to detail
the circumstance under which she met and befriended Lewinsky.
Tripp soon betrayed Lewinsky's confidence by surreptitiously--and,
probably, illegally--taping telephone conversations with Lewinsky.
By December 1997, Tripp and Lewinsky had {both,} mysteriously, been
subpoenaed to give depositions to attorneys for Paula Jones, in her
civil lawsuit against the President--a lawsuit instigated by British
intelligence operator and former London {Sunday Telegraph} Washington
correspondent Ambrose Evans-Pritchard. How Jones's attorneys came to
know of the existence of Tripp and Lewinsky is one question that may
hold a key to Tripp's role in the present attack against the President.
It should be recalled that, prior to being named the independent counsel
in Whitewater, Kenneth Starr had been paid by Richard Mellon Scaife,
through the Landmark Legal Foundation, to prepare an {amicus curiae}
brief in support of Paula Jones.
Tripp claims that, on Jan. 12, 1998, she took 20 hours of tape-recorded
conversations with Lewinsky to Whitewater Special Prosecutor Starr. The
next day, Starr arranged for Tripp to secretly tape her meeting with
Lewinsky at the Ritz Carlton Hotel near the Pentagon in Arlington,
At the time that Starr arranged for the FBI to secretly tape the
Tripp-Lewinsky meeting, {he had absolutely no jurisdiction to probe
President Clinton's relationship to the former White House aide.}
Indeed, it is critical that a full-scale probe be conducted, to
determine whether Tripp, who was in league with Starr from 1995, was
taping her conversations with Lewinsky on her own, or, covertly, on
behalf of Starr. At minimum, Starr vastly overstepped his jurisdiction;
far more likely, he himself broke the law--along with Tripp--in a
flagrant attempt to entrap and destroy President Clinton.
                 - No U.S. precedent -
In the 200-year history of the American Presidency, there have been
occasional sexual scandals involving top government officials; however,
never has such a personal scandal brought down the chief executive.
There is only one country in the world where heads of government are
brought to their knees through such tabloid scandal-mongering: Great
Britain. In 1963, Harold Macmillan's government was brought down by a
sex scandal involving Defense Minister John Profumo.
It is, therefore, not surprising that a review of the various
Clintongate scandals, from the 1993 so-called ``Troopergate'' affair to
the present attack, reveals that British intelligence stringer and
former {Sunday Telegraph} Washington correspondent Ambrose
Evans-Pritchard has been the chief instigator. As early as May 8, 1994,
in a {Sunday Telegraph} column, Evans-Pritchard boasted that he had been
instrumental in getting Paula Jones to file her civil suit against the
Evans-Pritchard has elsewhere boasted that his assignment, on behalf of
the British Crown's Hollinger Corporation, has been nothing less than
the total destruction of the Clinton Presidency. Writing in the Jan. 22
{Daily Telegraph,} Evans-Pritchard loudly bragged of his manipulation of
Paula Jones: ``My impression after befriending her four years ago,
before she took the momentous step of suing the President, is that her
motive was sheer rage.''
``Paula Jones has now achieved her object of inflicting massive damage
on Bill Clinton, with shortening odds that she may ultimately destroy
his Presidency,'' he continued. Evans-Pritchard accuses the U.S. news
media of covering up the Clinton sex scandals, so that only the
{American Spectator} or the British press will print the stories. ``What
Paula Jones has done is to use the immense power of legal discovery to
force the scandal to the surface. She has finally done the job that the
American media failed to do so miserably.''
This was precisely the strategy that Evans-Pritchard had laid out in
1994, when he acknowledged on May 8, 1994, that he had had ``a dozen
conversations with Mrs. Jones over the past two months.'' He furthermore
admitted that ``I happened to be present at a strategy meeting last
month on a boat on the Arkansas River,'' at which Jones's attorney ``was
weighing the pros and cons of legal action.''
It doesn't ``matter all that much whether Mrs. Jones ultimately wins or
loses her case,'' he wrote on May 15, 1994. ``The ticking time bomb in
the lawsuit lies elsewhere, in the testimony of other witnesses.''
``Put plainly,'' Evans-Pritchard blurted, ``the political purpose of the
Jones lawsuit is to reconstruct the inner history of the Arkansas
Governor's Mansion, using the legal power of discovery. In effect, the
two lawyers and their staff could soon be doing the job that the
American media failed to do during the election campaign and have
largely failed to do since.''
Evans-Pritchard's motive, in contrast to Jones's ``sheer rage,'' is a
deep, abiding hatred of the United States, and particularly, the
institution of its Presidency. Anyone who joins Evans-Pritchard in this
unfolding assault upon the Presidency, is joining the ranks of traitor
Aaron Burr.
A thorough probe of the current insurrection, beginning with a spotlight
on Linda Tripp, is more than appropriate.

     Do you want to end your money pressures forever?
     Do you want to double your income?
     Do you want to build an extra stream of income quickly?
If you answered yes, then let me show you how you can begin living your dreams, this year before it's too late.  I'll get right to the point.
As it says on the letterhead, my name is Robert Allen.  I'm famous for My two  New York Times best-selling books.  Nothing Down and Creating Wealth in America.

it's much easier and far less risky.  It involves:
-No employees
-Little risk
-Little start up cash
-It's so simple, anyone can do it

Dear Friend:

      ''Making over half million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your
        home  for an  investment of only $25 U.S. Dollars  expense one
        time''
        THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET!
       ===============================================
       BE A MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR !!
       Before you say ''Bull'' , please read the following. This is the
       letter you have  been  hearing about on the news lately. Due to the
       popularity of this letter on the internet, a national  weekly news
       program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of
       this program described below , to see if it really can make people
       money.
       The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal.
       Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely
       NO.  Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people
       can follow the simple instructions, they are bound to make
       some mega bucks with only $25 out of pocket cost''.
        DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT         THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING         BETTER THAN EVER.
        This is what one had to say:
       ''Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was approached
         many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad
         I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return
         for the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I
         received total $ 610,470.00 in  21 weeks, with money still          coming in''.

THE US 'ANNOUNCED' THEIR INTENTION TO USE B61-11 BUNKER BUSTERS ON LAST
NIGHT'S NEWS BULLETINS (BUT SOMEHOW FORGOT TO REFER TO THE FACT THAT THEY
ARE CLASSIFIED AS TACTICAL NUCLEAR WEAPONS)
2:00 a.m. Oct. 8, 2001 PDT
Following the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon,
Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld was questioned on ABC television's This
Week program about the possible use of tactical nuclear weapons in the
expected conflicts to come. In practiced Pentagonese, Rumsfeld deftly avoided answering the question
of whether the use of tactical nuclear weapons could be ruled out. Though large "theater" thermonuclear devices -- doomsday bombs -- don't
fit the Bush administration's war on terrorism, smaller tactical nukes do
not seem out of the question in the current mindset of the Defense
Department. The most likely candidate is a tactical micro-nuke called the B61-11, an
earth-penetrating nuclear device known as the "bunker buster." The B61-11 was designed to destroy underground military facilities such as
command bunkers, ballistic missile silos and facilities for producing and
storing weapons.

I'm really skeptical about this - handguns are generally banned in Brazil, so it seems really unlikely that they'd suddenly be permitted aboard airlines - a policy change that radical and that fast seems too good to be true.
I searched on Yahoo's Brazilian news - see  looking for "pistola" or "revolver" and couldn't find any mention of the change, though I did find some news stories about local shootings, and about how some US residents are buying guns because of the WTC attacks.

When the FBI guys come knocking, it's the worst of times
By Riad Z. Abdelkarim
    The  ring  at  my  doorbell  that Sunday afternoon was
    innocent enough. I set aside my laptop computer and my
    half-eaten Chicken McNuggets and went to the door.
    When  I  first  peered out and saw two sharply dressed
    men in business suits and dark sunglasses, I thought I
    was  being  visited  by  a  pair of friendly Jehovah's
    Witnesses.
    As I opened the door, however, it struck me that these
    men  were  a bit older than the young men of faith who
    usually canvassed the neighborhood.
    Any   lingering   doubt  about  their  identities  was
    immediately  erased  when  the  two  men flashed their
    badges  and  announced  --  in true X-Files fashion --
    that   they   were   with   the   Federal   Bureau  of
    Investigation.
    "What can I do for you gentlemen?" I asked.
    My  initial  puzzled  reaction  turned to concern when
    they  explained  that  they  wanted  to  speak with me
    "about   the   events   of  last  Tuesday,"  obviously
    referring  to  the  horrible terrorist attacks against
    the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
    I  told  them that I would be happy to speak with them
    if  they  made  an appointment to meet me later at the
    local   office  of  the  Council  on  American-Islamic
    Relations,  where I served as a member of the board of
    directors.
    Although  the  agents  were somewhat taken aback by my
    request,  they  ultimately  agreed. An appointment was
    made  for  the following evening, but the agents never
    appeared   to  interview  me  nor  did  they  call  to
    reschedule the meeting.
    The next morning, I awoke ill and asked that my clinic
    patients be rescheduled before stepping out to pick up
    some over-the-counter medication.
    During  this  time,  two  other agents visited both my
    home  and work place. When the agents did not find me,
    they  warned  my  wife ominously that they "would keep
    coming back."
    I  was  finally  able  to  reach  one of the agents by
    cellular  phone, and I made an appointment to meet him
    and his partner at a local coffee shop.
    What  ensued can best be described as a combination of
    a    fishing   expedition   and   a   scene   from   a
    straight-to-video B-movie.
    Holding  a  thin  folder  stamped "SECRET" in front of
    them,   the  agents  initially  queried  me  about  my
    background.  One  of  them  stopped in mid-sentence to
    change  a  question  from  "When  did  you come to the
    U.S.?" to "Where were you born?"
    They  appeared  somewhat  surprised when I mentioned I
    was born in Santa Monica, California, and had lived in
    Southern California my entire life.
    I  was then quizzed about my political views with such
    vague  questions  as  "Are  we  the  bad  guys in this
    thing?"  I  told the agents in no uncertain terms that
    there  could  be  no  justification whatsoever for the
    horrible terrorist attacks that had taken place.
    Further,  I  informed them that my political views are
    widely  known  because I frequently write commentaries
    that  are  published in newspapers around the country.
    In  fact, in the days following the terrorist attacks,
    my commentaries condemning the assaults and expressing
    the  shared  grief and outrage of American Muslims had
    appeared   in   newspapers   in   California,   Texas,
    Connecticut, Washington, D.C., New Jersey, and Madrid,
    Spain.
    The  agents  subsequently  inquired  about my numerous
    affiliations   with   several   prominent  and  widely
    respected   American   Muslim   advocacy   and  relief
    organizations.  At  no  time  was  I  asked  about any
    specific  individual,  nor was I asked to identify any
    suspects in photographs.
    The  interview's  low  point came when I asked why the
    agents had gone to my clinic, when I had provided them
    with  a  cellular telephone number at which I could be
    reached.
    Their  answer  spoke  volumes about the aimlessness of
    this investigation:
    "When  we  learned  that you were out sick, we thought
    that our worst fears had been realized -- that you had
    fled the country."
    I could no longer restrain my laughter.
    "Give me a break," I exclaimed incredulously.
    To  where  would  I  flee?  I am an American. I do not
    possess nor do I desire any other citizenship.
    By  the  end  of the 75-minute ordeal, I was convinced
    that  the  agents  were  not  acting  on  any specific
    information but were instead groping wildly for straws
    in the dark.
    I found this quite disheartening.
    I   harbor   no  ill  will  toward  those  agents  who
    interviewed   me.   I  realize  that  they  were  just
    following orders. Like other Americans who are Muslims
    or  of Arabic ethnicity, I earnestly support the FBI's
    attempts   to   vigorously  investigate  this  heinous
    terrorist act and bring those responsible to justice.
    What  I  do  not  appreciate  is being singled out for
    questioning  merely  because of my faith, my ethnicity
    or my legitimate political activism.
    As noted in a Christian Science Monitor editorial this
    week,  "to have FBI agents with no preparatory contact
    knocking  on the doors of Arab or Muslim citizens with
    no  clear  ties  to  acts  of  crime  is a sure way to
    instill fear right where cooperation is most needed."
    In  legal  parlance,  this  practice is referred to as
    "profiling." In my book, it's just plain racism.
    And it has no place in my country.

The California State Department of Fish and Game is advising hikers,
hunters, fishermen and golfers to take extra precautions and keep alert for
bears while in the Yosemite and Mammoth areas. They advise people to
wear noise-producing devices such as little bells on their clothing to alert
but not startle the bear unexpectedly. They also advise carrying pepper
spray in case of an encounter with a bear.
It is also a good idea to watch for fresh signs of bear activity and
know the difference between black bear and grizzly bear droppings.
Black bear droppings are smaller and contain berries and possibly squirrel
Grizzly bear droppings have little bells in them and smell like pepper

Final Call for Papers
                             ASIAN'03
            Eighth Asian Computing Science Conference
                       Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai, India
                      December 10-13, 2003
              Collocated with ICLP'03 and FSTTCS'03
                 ****** SUBMISSION DEADLINE EXTENDED TO AUGUST 11, 2003******
The phenomenal success of the Internet at the application level may
perhaps primarily be attributed to a few simple but powerful ideas: a
client-server computing model, stateless (or partially stateful)
protocols (such as SMTP, HTTP, Instant Messaging and Presence
Protocols), the separation of transport from content, etc.  Fundamental
limitations of these ideas are already being addressed by the
development of middleware platforms for distributed applications (e.g.,
J2EE, Groove, Jini, .Net).  In the future, experience with large-scale
distributed applications may result in well-understood computational
models that are enshrined in programming languages with support for
uniform naming, reflexive operation, fault tolerance, distribution,
locality, partially disconnected operation, persistence, mobility,
autonomic operation, spatial aggregation, continuous streaming, etc.
The theme of this conference is PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES and DISTRIBUTED
COMPUTATION.  Papers are invited on all aspects of theory, practice and
applications related to this theme.  Papers targeting lessons learnt
from the development of large-scale application frameworks (e.g.,
Internet applications, distributed sensor networks) that may serve as
the basis for the development of programming languages are particularly
  - Programming languages for distributed computation
  - Distributed capability-based computing
  - Grid computing
  - Peer-to-peer computing
  - Static analysis and type systems
  - Provably secure distributed computing
  - Proof-carrying code
  - Persistence in distributed computation
  - Language implications for
        Trust management / Reputation management /
        Public-key infrastructure
  - Language aspects of Internet middleware
  - Web services
  - Programming models for:
        Distributed sensor networks / Epidemic algorithms /
        Real-time streaming and querying
  - Model-based methods for distributed systems
  - Modeling of distributed systems
  - Large-scale distributed applications:
        Distributed MUDs / Distributed gaming environments /
        Electronic communities / Distributed collaboration environments

  The series of annual Asian Computing Science Conferences (ASIAN) was
  initiated in 1995 by AIT, INRIA and UNU/IIST to provide a forum for
  researchers in computer science from the Asian region and to promote
  interaction with researchers from other regions. The first seven
  conferences were held, respectively, in Bangkok, Singapore,
  Kathmandu, Manila, Phuket, Penang, and Hanoi. In addition to support
  from the host countries, they have also been sponsored by INRIA,
  France, UNU/IIST, Macau and NUS, Singapore. The proceedings have
  been published as Lecture Notes in Computer Science by
  Springer-Verlag.

Efforts at an out of court settlement having failed, the issue between
Adam Kosmin and Toshiba will at some unknown date be tried in a court of
law.  The case may be tried on Monday 30 June 2003, but the court might
rather set yet another date some time in the future, perhaps a month from
now.  So far Adam Kosmin and Toshiba have been out to the Queens County
courthouse three times.  This Monday's appearance will be the fourth in
this matter.
Adam Kosmin has written an important article on Refund Day II and what we
can do to help the courts and the press and the people understand:
At 5:00 pm on Monday 30 June 2003 Adam Kosmin and some tribesfolk will
gather at the coffee house across the street from the Queens County
courthouse.  All supporters of free software and all students of contract
law are invited!
If the case is heard this Monday, it might be useful to have on hand more
than one laptop computer running a free OS.  As always, Knoppix, or Knoppix
variant, disks are welcome.  These tools may help us explain to the judge
some facts that are not often presented in large circulation newspapers.
If convenient, wear standard CLOTHES OF RESPECT.  Do not interrupt or shout
out in court.  You may not read in court.  You must sit and pay attention
and be ready to help the judge and Adam.
Here is information about Refund Day I:
Adam Kosmin is the leader of Refund Day II and all questions should be
addressed to him at

For more about Refund Day II:
This action is not the whole of Refund Day II.  It is just the beginning.
Already other actions, not yet public, are in process.  No matter what
happens in court we will continue the fight.  What is at stake is our right
to private ownership of computers and our right to free private, tribal,
business, and public use of the Net.

And then too, of course, the "dramatic demonstration" from
SAN DIEGO - October 31, 2003 -- Satellite Security Systems (S3), a global
provider of asset security and logistics control, in cooperation with the
California Highway Patrol (CHP) and InterState Oil Company, dramatically
demonstrated the first wireless remote shutdown of a fully loaded moving
petrochemical tanker truck.
site - satellite communications were used to disable the truck in seconds,
proving S3's GlobalGuardT and FleetGuardT a viable solution to the challenge
of controlling rogue hazardous waste vehicles that could pose a threat to
homeland security.
The event, conducted on CHP Academy grounds in Sacramento and administered
by the CHP, addresses ongoing concerns about the affordability of effective
security technology, stealthiness of such a security device, and how GPS
monitoring can be incorporated safely into law enforcement protocol.

4 Jewish Web sites deemed 'terrorist'
By Jerry Seper
THE WASHINGTON TIMES
Four Internet Web sites operated by two extremist Jewish groups have
included by the State Department on its list of "foreign terrorist
organizations"  the first time the list has been extended to include
Internet sites.
     The four Web sites are:  and  the department said in a notice in the Federal
Register. They offer news, commentary and links to other sites of
interest to
followers of Meir Kahane.
The impact of the listing was not immediately clear, since all four
exist in cyberspace.
The designation makes it illegal for persons in the United States to
money or other material support to the Web sites. The three accessible
yesterday included information on where contributions could be sent,
items could be donated and offered a number items for sale, including
pendants and books.

The collection of concurrences on the merits are quite interesting.  The Chief's opinion adopts the SG's argument -- darn-near-preposterous, IMHO (and that of Justice Thomas!) -- that the Pledge is OK in schools because "under God" is "not endorsement of any religion," but instead "a simple recognition of the fact [that] '[f]rom the time of our earliest history our peoples and our institutions have reflected the traditional concept that our Nation was founded on a fundamental belief in God.'"    Justice Thomas concludes -- correctly, in my view, see  -- that if Lee v. Weisman was correctly decided, then public schools may not lead students in daily recitation of the words "under God."  Thomas, however, would overrule Lee.

@_subject: private vs. public tor network ... any other options ? 
If you limit yourself to a small set of nodes, you
will definitely compromise your anonymity against a powerful attacker. But
what if you're not worried about a powerful attacker, or serious anonymity?
What if you just want a casual observer to think you're using Tor, and leave
it at that?
You could run two relays on each node you control. One relay would be part
of the public tor network, and limit the bandwidth to a (large) fraction of
what you have available. One relay would be part of your private tor network
and use the rest of the available bandwidth. You'd have to bootstrap your
tor network from scratch, and set up an authority, and so on. Then you could
run your local tor client on your private network, and have a small set of
fast nodes available to you. A casual observer at either end (you-hop1 or
hop3-internet) would see the traffic from/to a tor node, and assume that it
was truly torified. Depending what you personally think the threat profile
is - and I'd suggest reading some of the research to find out what threats
to consider - you might want to use an entry point or exit node on the
regular network, or do other circuit manipulation.
Note that trying to take advantage of your own resources inevitably limits
your anonymity potential. Customizing your network also means that you won't
benefit as much, or at all, from upgrades to Tor. However, if all you want
is casually anonymous browsing at high speed, this may be useful to you.
Nonetheless, I make no guarantees that the system you set up will be
sufficiently anonymous for you.

@_subject: Switzerland ... to stop private banks from creating money out 
of nothing - thin air - and then lending it out as an
interesting-bearing debt!
Switzerland will have a referendum on whether to stop private banks
from creating money out of thin air.
HOME » BLOG » 2015 » DECEMBER » 08 » SWITZERLAND WILL.
WRITTEN BY POSITIVE MONEY  ON DECEMBER 8, 2015.
The Swiss population will be the first in the world to vote on their
banking and money system, thanks to the tireless efforts of our sister
organisation Modernizing Money The campaign, which has involved over 100 activists collecting
signatures, gathered 111,819 signatures to have a referendum on
removing the power that banks currently have to create money when they
make loans. They made it within 18 months, which under Swiss law
results in a referendum.
On Tuesday 1st December
Positive Money's director Fran Boait and the coordinator of the
international movement for monetary reform Stan were in Switzerland at
the invitation of the MoMo to officially hand in the petition with all
the signatures to the Swiss Parliament.
This was a great day for the monetary reform movement. Some of the
other members of the International movement and also NEF joined the
MoMo in Switzerland to celebrate handing in the petition and to begin
planning a strategy for the referendum.
Here you can view the video of the hand-in (although the commentary is
available only in German):
The Financial Times has reported about it in an article entitled "A
licence to print e-money for private banks"
 by Martin Sandbu:
But what if ordinary joes like you and me cotton on to this scam
What scam?
That private banks just create money at will.
You mean you agree with this Swiss initiative now?
How could I not? If banks can just print electronic money, that's just
as destabilising as printing notes freely.
It's a really great article. You can read it in full here
One of our twitter followers have commented on it with the words:
Duncan McCann, researcher on Economy and Finance from NEF was there at
the hand-in of signatures as well and has written an article about it
which you can read here
Although the battle to get the Swiss parliament to acknowledge the
current problems with the Swiss monetary system will be hard, the
referendum offers perhaps the greatest opportunity we've seen in
Europe for a fundamental rethink of the current monetary system and a
genuine debate about the future of economics. Economist Steve Keen
added that "whatever the outcome of this proposal, the debate it will
allow over our monetary system is one that we have to have".

To John-
there are over 200 groups discussing the same issues, at least 2 got
nationalised aggressively, and there have been some tangential posts
on blogs or commercial forums mainly concerns about their datacenter
security not knowing who might attack them, but overall the same
concerns are expressed:
Can the data be spoofed? Not at this resolution without having a model
of everything at the same resolution...
Are the blocks secure? No. [...] But services are stable.
Exports to public? yes, p2p clusters loading, datacenters doing
preparation processing, packed table files are set up for distributed
How do *you* know? UHD/4k VNC video stream to one of the master
control servers handling the database import and text chat with 200
others, no direct access to data here, but certainty that the data is
Involved how? rendering code to make GEO-TIFF map tiles and aggrigated
spline/curves to simplify snapshot data and level of detail pyramid
(multi-variate parametric search) index data.
Now we ask... If this was NATO-ish or any variety of US/UK system
built in the 1960s(?) can we solve for locations or viable downlink
targets to intercept? This hint at geo-magnetic shift is a huge
The coin data is ... glorious... but the other signals are no less
amusing, one set appears to be wired sigint in mhz carrier bands,
assumably urban analogue phone signals as recorded from the switch
routing system's ground or related wiretaps to rf via cable.
genome.gov had links to the various data formats that others
identified in the organics table.
X-Ray physics and detector materials need research, 1890s through
1970s was a huge ammount of X-Ray publicity, but NEVER EVER DID ANYONE
USE IT FOR SIGNALING??? BULLSHIT!
"is there any distinction at military bases or secure areas?" YES.
there is some access control doors which others suggest is a standard
card reader with number pad and automatic door that is common on the
secure layer of military and COMMERCIAL CONTRACTOR facilities that has
a proximity detector signal built into the door frame. THE COIN DATA
WARPS AROUND THIS CYLINDRICAL SIGNAL ON THE DOOR PORTAL AND VECTOR
PASSES THROUGH THE WALL. Obviously the vector is impossible without
fields projected from that security device! There is also a ghosting
signature that reduces sample rate (in the digitiser) around similar
facilities, looks like it was isolated in the newer signal index, so
it should be really obvious who is using these jamming systems and
where! (and where else!)
more questions:
coins on boats? yes.
coins on submarines? YES. (with ghosting)
organic signals? wtf?
Yes, but im told the prior emailed reference is erroneous: the primary
index is a SIGNALS CHARACTERISTIC tree, the supporting block (large
bit scope number) is VERY SIMILAR to a genetic expression profile tree
such as genome.gov/ and many of the gene profiling standards.
Hopefully the news will start posting the technical reports the
primary groups have been preparing last few days... we need to get
physics and advanced crypto groups attention, if the signals are
encoded and that party broke through dense analogue crypto, it will
take a huge effort to solve for that (it may have been an analogue EM
field as well that performed the encoding or reference signals) to
make the same capability posible for others.

@_subject: Mondex: our press release 
Forwarded message:
Press Release.
Hyperion have been working with Mondex International to develop a
smartcard-based electronic cash service which will be launched in the UK in
Mondex has been invented as an alternative to cash.  At the heart of the
system is a plastic smart card which stores electronic cash value.  Mondex
customers will be able to use specially adapted NatWest and Midland cash
machines (ATMs) or a new generation of BT telephones to transfer cash between
their bank accounts and their cards.
Once funds have been transferred onto the customer's Mondex card it can be
used to make purchases up to the total cash value held on the card or to make
payments by telephone.  The card can be used to make purchases for large or
small amounts.
Mondex cards can be locked by the cardholder and unlocked by using a personal
code.  Once locked, the money in the card cannot be spent without re-keying
this personal code.  Shoppers will not need to sign anything when using the
card and there will be no need for authorisation calls; the customer's card is
inserted into the terminal and the value is instantly moved from the card to
the terminal.  With Mondex, retailers will not have to account to the bank for
each individual transaction; their electronic terminal will simply accumulate
the total value of Mondex transactions, which can be banked by telephone line
at any time.
Cardholders will be able to check how much cash they have left on their card
at ATMs, a new range of BT payphones and home phones or by using a small
key-ring sized personal reader.  A pocket-sized electronic wallet will show
cash available as well as providing a record of the last ten transactions.  It
can also be used for transferring money from one card to another or for
transferring cash into the wallet for safer-keeping at home.  The card is
designed to be used by children as young as 5.
In summary, among the benefits consumers will see are: 24-hour electronic cash
at Mondex phones which may be available at home, in shops or at work and a
convenient, simple to operate alternative to cash that is inherently safer to
carry.  Retailers and other cash handling business will benefit from an
efficient, faster, and more secure way of handling money that is economic to
In 1990, National Westminster needed a consultancy capable of translating
radical business ideas into reality.  They chose Hyperion.  We have provided
resources to assist in:
*       The development of requirements, functional specifications and
architectural specifications for a variety of services.
*       The development of software specifications for a large variety of
*       The management of software implementations, performed by developers

*       The management of testing and integration activities, including the
development of rigorous test specifications derived from the structured

Hyperion's considerable expertise in the practical analysis and specification
of highly secure financial systems is well known and this appointment has
confirmed their position as world leaders in electronic payment systems
consultancy, following on as it does from their work for organisations such as
the Bank of England, APACS and SWIFT.
Notes for Editors-Why is this interesting?
1.  This is believed to be the world's first implementation of general
purpose, person-to-person electronic money-a genuine replacement for notes and
2.  Since electronic money works over the telephone, for the first time in
history people can exchange cash without being in the same place at the same
3.  Recent figures show the cost to UK banks of moving cash around is
approximately 4.5Bn/annum.
4.  A senior NatWest executive predicted that in 10-15 years' time, the
telephone will be the dominant way in which electronic money is deposited and
5.  Analysts estimate that the service, if successful, will add around
100M/annum to BT revenues (The Times, 9th December 1993).
Notes for Editors-Mondex
Mondex International is a joint venture between National Westminster Bank (the
UK's largest retail bank) and Midland Bank (part of the Hong Kong and Shanghai
Banking Corporation).  They are working with BT in the UK to introduce
domestic service next year, beginning with a trial in Swindon.
National Westminster will be actively seeking banking partners worldwide to
establish Mondex as the basis for a global electronic cash payment scheme.
A number of international technology companies, including Dai Nippon Printing
Co. Ltd., Hitachi Limited, NCR, Panasonic (Matsushita Electric
Industrial/Matsushita Battery), Oki Electric Industry Company Limited, SPOM
Japan Co. Ltd., and Texas Instruments Limited are working with National
Westminster developing suitable components and equipment for the Mondex
The public launch of the service will take place in Swindon in 1995.  All
40,000 of the banks' customers will be eligible and the banks plan to have all
1,000 or so retailers in Swindon taking part.

The 'Mark of the Toad'.
That's what the Channel Government's news releases had called
his grandfather's tattoo when they had displayed it in 3D color
on GraphiCubes around the world. Jonathan's grandfather had the
tattoo done in an era when there was little danger associated
with being a member of the loosely-knit crypto-anarchists group
known as the CypherPunks.
Even after the beginning stages of InfoWar stirred its ugly head,
Jonathan's grandfather refused to have his tattoo removed, as
did most of the original CypherPunks list members. He considered
it a badge of honor. For Jonathan, however, the Mark of the Toad
had remained a mark of disgrace, forcing his family to flee for
their lives and change their identities.
Jonathan had managed to rise above all of this and put it behind
him, becoming a normal, accepted member of the society around
him. Now, however, his life of normality was being threatened.
The original home of the CypherPunks mailing list.
Jonathan had recognized the format of the message header immediately,
having seen many like it in his grandfather's study as a child.
Normally, only the Masters of Antiquity would be capable of discerning
this header to be from a bygone era when InterNet transmissions
were still carried largely over land-lines, but even they would
probably not recognize the significance of the date, which was
burned into Jonathan's mind from the countless hours he had spent
poring over CypherPunks messages that he had purloined from his
grandfather's hidden files.
January 19, 1997.
The beginning date of the 'moderation experiment' on the legendary
CypherPunks mailing list. The beginning probe in preparation for
the launching of InfoWar-an experiment which had failed miserably
and had caused a delay in the plans of the Evil One. A delay caused
by the damnable insolence of the terminal misfits among the CypherPunks.
An insolence that was rumored to be fueled by the Circle of Eunuchs,
fanning the 'flames' of dissent among the CypherPunks, helping
them to resist the herding of their list members into the group-mindset
desired by the Evil One.
Jonathan sat frozen in his seat, once again, his brain locked
from the major dichotomies being produced as a result of his present-in
which the CypherPunks were a villainous band of rogues who had
instigated the launching of Channel War II-and his past, in which
his grandfather had been exposed both as one of the major players
in both the launching of Channel War II, and as traitorous scum
who had sabotaged the goals of the CypherPunks in that same historical
Jonathan's grandfather wasn't just a CypherPunk. He was the Fool.
Jonathan reached for a bottle of Jim Beam and, in doing so, realized
that he had subconsciously come to a decision. He would seek out
Bubba Rom Dos.
He would seek out the Circle of Eunuchs.

and the email sent to the Internet Content Coalition players just
before they held the meeting where they effectively folded their
hand in their attempt to take over control over defining what
was 'official' news on the InterNet, and what was not.
He reread, once again, the anonymous post sent just hours before
the Internet Content Coalition's grand agenda bit the dust:
"In July, Anson Ng, a reporter for the Financial Times
of London was shot and KILLED in Guatemala. He had reportedly been trying
to interview an American there named Jimmy Hughes, a one-time
director of security for the Cabazon Indian Reservation secret
"In April, a Philadelphia attorney named Dennis Eisman was
found DEAD, killed by a single bullet in his chest. According to a former
federal official who worked with Eisman, the attorney was found
dead in the parking lot where he had been due to meet with a woman
who had crucial evidence to share substantiating Riconosciuto's claims.
"Both Eisman's and Ng's deaths were declared 'suicides' by
"Fred Alvarez, a Cabazon tribal leader who was in vocal opposition
to the developments on the reservation, was found SHOT TO DEATH
WITH TWO FRIENDS in 1981. Their murder remains unsolved.
At last, the whole bizarre, implausible scenario finally came
together in A Player To Be Named Later's mind.
The Author's presence near the belly of the beast in Indio had
not been a mere coincidence. When the Internet Content Coalition
made their move, the Circle of Eunuchs already had the information
they needed to connect several of the players in the proposed
news cartel with the trail of deaths surrounding both those involved
in the INSLAW debacle and the reporters closing in on the real
story involved.
And they had made it more than plain that some of those involved
in the Wackenhut-Cabazon arms deals were now playing for the oppositionï¿½and
that bullets don't discriminate between the rich and the poor.
A Player To Be Named Later was still mystified as to how the Magic
Circle had been able to pull off such a bold, in-your-face maneuver
on some of the Titans of the news and computer industries.
In the early days, after the dissemination of "The Xenix
Chainsaw Massacre" had begun in 1989, the Circle of Eunuchs
had come under fierce attack from a variety of sources from within
the secret government hunting them. Mysterious deaths, established
careers going up in flames, overnight. The Magic Circle had quickly
disappeared far into the underground of computer society.
Then, the Circle had begun to show their hand, more and more,
now reaching the point where they could apparently do battle with
the heavyweights working behind the scenes with Gomez and the
Dark Allies. But A Player To Be Named Later hadn't seen any indication
that the Circle of Eunuchs had managed to gain possession of a
hole-card that could account forï¿½unlessï¿½
"Casolaro!" A Player To Be Named Later whispered,
as if speaking the name aloud might bring down fire from the heavens.
Quickly, he did a disk search for a vaguely remembered article
from Conspiracy Nationï¿½
Conspiracy Nation -- Vol. 3 Num.
("Quid coniuratio est?")
THE OCTOPUS
By Karen Bixman
(For The People *News Reporter*, 11/14/94)
On the morning of August 11, 1991, Danny Casolaro was found
dead in the bathroom of his hotel room at the Sheraton Hotel in Martinsburg, West Virginia. His wrists had been slashed ten times; his briefcase and notes were missing. The authorities labeled the death a suicide, and before Casolaro's family had
been contacted, the body was embalmed.
Damn! He had nailed it!
Karen Bixman's article had confirmed everything that A Player
To Be Named Later had increasingly suspected as his mind pored
over the mountain of information which had seemed so tentatively,
but treacherously, related.
Bixman had laid down an utterly astounding, twisted trail of closely
connected, mysterious deaths and blatant murders surrounding the
INSLAW and Iran-Contra misdeeds that completed the connections
between the past and current players in the battle for control
of world supremacy in computer information and communications.
What's more, the timing of the disappearance of Danny Casolaro's
extensive notes on the winding serpent of evil surrounding these
affairs coincided with the Magic Circle's unmistakable reentry
into manifest participation in the battle against the Evil One
and the Dark Forces under his command.
The Coupe de Gras, however, was the source of the Conspiracy Nation
Prairienet.org! From whence sprang the apparently unrelated Bureau42
clique who had seized the opportunity to host 'The True Story
of the InterNet' transcripts, despite the troubled and bloody
history of those who had done so in the past.
Bianca had mentioned to Mike Denney, at Basis Inc., that she had
been prepared to hack the Bureau42 servers when they came under
attack upon placing 'Part II' and 'Part III' on their system,
but that they had managed to clear up the problems that developed
on their own, and had done so in a surprisingly short period of
Only one thing was still bothering A Player To Be Named Later.
Microsoft had been the first member of the Internet Content Coalition
to publicly fold their hand in the battle to control news and
information ratings across the InterNet, but Gates seemed, on
the surface, to be less visibly connected to the extremely messy
past misconduct of the others, and thus seemed to have the least
to lose if the shit hit the fan.
Gate's quick concession to the veiled threats had definitely been
the catalyst in causing the hasty retreat of the other members
of the news cartel that had seemed to be on the drawing board
for quite some time in the plans of Gomez and the Dark Alliesï¿½but
Bill Gates had not become the richest and most overtly powerful
individual on the face of the earth by fighting against the grand
designs of the Evil One, but he seemed to be playing his cards
close to his chest, in a manner that suggested that he had an
agenda of his own that might not run exactly parallel to that
of the Dark Forces.
What was BillyG's game?
A Player To Be Named Later had been involved in the grand battle
taking place behind the scenes of everyday reality for long enough
to know that it was all done with mirrors.
"And each man, in his time, plays many parts." he
said, perplexed for the moment.
"To Shakespeare!" A Player To Be Named Later
said, lifting his glass in toast. "A member of the Magic
Circle, if there ever was one."
"If there ever was oneï¿½" he repeated, smiling
at his unintentional inside joke.
The Shadow was watching Bad BillyG closely, for any sign of subterfuge
in his inner demeanor.
"You're certain about Blanc Weber?" he asked,
once again.
"Well, I could be wrong, but we've investigated her thoroughly,
and every indication is that all that nonsense about her development
of the HydroCube is just that-nonsense."
BillyG shrugged his shoulders, apparently unconcerned with what
he regarded as a small, internal company matter.
"I could have her isolated, but I don't really see much
point. If she is hiding something, then it's probably better
not to let her know how closely she is being monitored. Perhaps
you should put some of the Dark Allies on her tail for a while,
in case there is something that my people have missed."
"No, I don't think that will be necessary." the
Shadow replied, casually.
He had instructed his men to monitor Blanc Weber's movements and
activities months ago, as well as those of the spooks Bad BillyG
had assigned to watch her. His own spooks had likewise turned
up nothing positive, but he had pressed the matter with Gates
in order to judge his reaction just the same.
"Well, her digital implant went according to plan,"
BillyG added, "so we will be able to yank her chain
on a moment's notice, if it becomes necessary to do so, in the
The "billionaire to be named later" sat back and allowed
himself to indulge in the luxury of looking forward to the moment
when A Player To Be Named Later would find out much, much more
than he really wanted to know about Bad BillyG's plans for the
tattered remnants of the Magic Circle who were attempting to interfere
with his own vision of the direction the future of the InterNet
should take at this nadir point in time, when the battle for control
of virtual reality was about to explode into every single facet
of human life
Bubba Rom Dos thought about the forefather of his technical namesake,
who had so far managed to walk with the Evil One as far as the
bridge in his rise to riches, fame and power a hundred years in
the past.
The Cowboy, Priscilla, Alexis, Jonathan, and d'Shauneaux were
likewise joined with him in contemplation of this paradoxical
figure from the past whose role in the great battle between the
Forces of Light and the Forces of Darkness had remained an enigma
throughout the history and legends of the Circle of Eunuchs.
Friend or foe, there was no denying that Billy the Kid was going
to play a major role in the direction that the thundering train
of history was about to take as it approached the crossroads of
destiny on its way to an ElectroMagnetic Future where freedom
would hinge on the free flow of Taoist bytes routing around the
enslaving chains of Fascist bits that Gomez and the Dark Allies
had been carefully laying in place since the dawn of the Computer

if trying to tell the small assembly something very, very important

i buy the argument that transaction instantaneity is a solution to the
identity theft problem - my cash in your hands, at the same time (now) as
your goods in my hands, in a way that allows both of us to ensure we have
got what we wanted.  But there's a trade-off; I have to use money, not
credit, now - your point about the buyer 'lending' the seller cash at 0%
interest.  I'm not sure how "the system compensates" for that.  It seems to
me it becomes a risk-cost trade-off for the individual: I can work out the
cost to me of using real money not credit; then I know what I am paying to
insure myself against identity theft.  Of course I probably rely on the
credit people covering me against a lot of the risk of identity theft, and
I may not even pay them for that cost (if it is built into the APR they
charge and I can avoid interest by paying off the card quickly)... so to me
identity theft risk is almost costless.  Why then would I choose to insure
myself explicitly by using cash instead of credit?
What is it that makes all the individuals start thinking about the best
interests of "the system" (which should be cheaper without all these hidden
insurance costs) instead of thinking about their own interests?!

More like the straw that broke the camel's back, admittedly.
A long time ago I came to the conclusion that the closer we get to
transaction instantaneity, the less counterparty identity matters at
all. That is, the fastest transaction we can think of is a
cryptographically secure glop of bits that is issued by an entity who
is responsible for the integrity of the transaction and the quality
of assets that the bits represent. Blind signature notes work fine
for a first-order approximation. In other words, an internet bearer
In such a scenario, nobody *cares* who the counterparties are for two
reasons. The first reason is existential: title to the asset has
transferred instantaneously. There is *no* float. I have it now, so I
don't *care* who you were, because, well, it's *mine* now. :-).
Second, keeping an audit trail when the title is never in question
is, in the best circumstances superfluous and expensive, and, in the
worst, even dangerous for any of a number of security reasons,
depending on the color of your adversary's hat, or the color your
adversary thinks his hat is, or whatever. Keeping track of credit
card numbers in a database is an extant problem, for instance, with a
known, shall we say, market cost. We'll leave political seizure  and
other artifacts of totalitarianism to counted by the actuaries.
I'm walking out on a limb here, in light of what I said above, and
saying that when there's *any* float in the process, your liability
for identity theft increases with the float involved. Furthermore,
book-entry transactions *require* float, somewhere. They are
debt-dependent. Someone has to *borrow* money to effect a
transaction. (In a bearer transaction, the shoe's on the other foot,
the purchaser is *loaning* money, at zero interest, but that's what
the buyer wants so the system compensates accordingly, but that's
another story.) Because the purchaser has to borrow money to pay, and
because you *cannot* wring the float out of a transaction (that is,
you can get instantaneous execution, but the transaction clears and
settles at a later date; 90 days is the maximum float time for a
non-repudiated credit-card transaction, for instance), I claim that
book-entry transactions will *always* be liable for "identity" theft.
Put another way, remember Doug Barnes' famous quip that "and then you
go to jail" is not an acceptable error handling step for a
transnational internet transaction protocol.
I would claim that enforcement of identity as a legal concept costs
too much in the long run to be useful, and that the cheapest way to
avoid the whole problem is to go to systems which not only don't
require identity, but they don't even require book-entry *accounts*
at all to function at the user level.
Financial cryptography has had that technology for more than two
decades now, so long that the patent's about expired on it, if it
hasn't already.
See above. When you use book-entry transactions, by definition, you
need identity. Biometric, is-a-person,
go-to-jail-if-you-lie-about-a-book-entry identity. With bearer
transactions, digital/internet or otherwise, you don't have identity.
You don't *need* identity to execute, clear, and settle the
transaction, primarily because all three happen at once. There's no
float between the three activities. You don't have to send someone to
jail if they lie, because the transaction never executes in the first
place if they do.
Now, there are tradeoffs. The first one is key management, which as
Schneier likes to point out, is a hard problem. Personally, I think
that if you don't have to associate a key with a flesh-and-blood body
in meatspace, a whole continent full of problems just disappears. In
a bearer transaction, it's orthogonal to the issue of security
anyway, and all it does is cost you money to do for no added benefit.
The second one is security of the digital bearer notes and coins
themselves, which, frankly, scares people in the finance business
most of all. However, I would claim that all organizations, and even
people :-), do their *database* and document backups already, and
that proper system hygiene will evolve, particularly if literal money
is involved. Frankly, there already is a market for distributed data
storage, and there are even working systems using m-of-n distributed
data storage, which would be the most secure way to solve the
problem. And, as we all know, digital bearer transactions are the
best *way* to pay for those kinds of m-of-n services anyway, so it
feeds on itself nicely.
I think that it's less of a chicken-and-egg problem than it used to
be, and I think that reality is catching up to all the theory we've
kicked around on these lists for more than a decade now.  The
ultimate solution to the problem of identity theft is to not use
identity at all, and, frankly, not even to use book-entries at all.

I'm glad to see Stu joining the civil libertarian crowd. He's right, of course, that there are reasons to be uneasy about the new "Combating Terrorism Act."
Current law permits specific Justice Department officials to authorize meatspace telephone pen register and trap and trace devices without a court order in two circumstances. Here's an excerpt from the U.S. Code:
This bill does three things of note:
1. It adds "U.S. Attorney" to the list of officials who can authorize warantless surveillance.
2. It expands the "emergency situation" rule beyond serious bodily injury/organized crime. I described this in my article:
3. It rewrites pen register/trap and trace law and moves it from the telephone world to explicitly cover computer networks as well, which would permit Carnivore's use under this section (when operated in trap-and-trace/pen-register mode). Here are some excerpts from the bill:
Now, whether all this is, as Stu blandly suggests, "a bit alarmist," is up to IPers to decide. But I think Senator Patrick Leahy, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary committee, put it well during the floor debate last night. Here's a quote from the Congressional Record.

Choate replies:
Sunder continues, along with Choate's replies:
Essential Feature-
The passive-aggressive (negativistic) personality disorder is located in
Appendix B: "Criteria Sets and Axes Provided for Further Study" of the DSM-
IV.  Millon (1996, p. 198) proposes a comprehensive concept of a
personality.  He asserts that the negativistic personality reflects both
this general contrariness and disinclination to do as others wish but also
presents with a capricious impulsiveness, an irritable moodiness, and an
unaccommodating, fault-finding pessimism.
The DSM-IV (1994, p. 733) describes the PAPD essential feature as a
pattern of negativistic attitudes and passive resistance to demands for
adequate performance in social and occupational settings.
The subject, Choate, demonstrates these traits clearly, particularly in
the context of responses to otherwise reasonable requests from the
social group "cypherpunks" from which the above samples are taken.
The general criteria of a personality disorder coupled with at least five
of the following is sufficient to warrant a diagnosis of Passive-Aggressive
Personality Disorder: procrastination and delay in completing essential
tasks -- particularly those that others seek to have completed; unjustified
protests that others make unreasonable demands; sulkiness, irritability
or argumentativeness when asked to do something that the individual does
not want to do; unreasonable criticism or scorn for authority figures;
slow or poor work on unwanted tasks; obstruction of the efforts of others
even as these individuals fail to do their share of the work; and avoidance
of obligations by claiming to have forgotten them.
Examining the small sample above it is clear that Choate meets at least
of these subset criteria.  (This author has little doubt that a fifth will
quickly emerge with further study).   Procrastination and delay in
any of the tasks requested of him (the addition of more substantive
which accompany his rote contributions to the mailing list), unjustified
protests that others make unreasonable demands (in the case of Sunder
Choate's responses to Sunder's request for a more digest format illustrates
this), irritability or argumentativeness when asked to do something that
the individual does not want to do (while Choate could easily have ignored
the request, he chose instead to reply in an increasingly inflammatory and
argumentative tone), unreasonable criticism or scorn for authority figures
(as evidenced by material in his signature - "Legislators and Judges are
the pimps of modern American society.")
The passive-aggressive personality disorder was first introduced in a U.S.
War Department technical bulletin in 1945. The term was coined by wartime
psychiatrists who found themselves dealing with reluctant and uncooperative
soldiers who followed orders with chronic, veiled hostility and smoldering
resentment. Their style was a mixture of passive resistance and grumbling
compliance (Stone, 1993, p. 361).
Choate's response seems to mirror this type of response quite closely and
further study under the reference of Stone's work should be pursued.
The current criteria for the passive-aggressive personality disorder as
proposed by the Personality Disorders Work Group for the DSM-IV includes:
1. passive resistance to fulfilling social and occupational tasks through
procrastination and inefficiency;
2. complaints of being misunderstood, unappreciated, and victimized by
3. sullenness, irritability, and argumentativeness in response to
4. angry and pessimistic attitudes toward a variety of events;
5. unreasonable criticism and scorn toward those in authority;
6. envy and resentment toward those who are more fortunate;
7. self-definition as luckless in life and an inclination to whine and
about being jinxed;
8. alternating behavior between hostile assertion of personal autonomy and
dependent contrition (Millon & Radovanov, Livesley, ed., 1995, p. 321).
Millon suggests that the most essential features of PAPD are irritable
behavioral contrariness, obstructiveness, and sulking; discontented self-
image, e.g. feels unappreciated and misunderstood; deficient regulatory
control, i.e. poorly modulated emotional expression; and interpersonal
They are noted for their interpersonal conflict, verbal aggressiveness,
and manipulative behavior. Suicidal gestures and a lack of attention to
everyday responsibilities are common (Millon, 1996, p. 198).
Little study is needed to recognize the diagnosis as a strong one for the
subject Choate.
PAPD resistance to external demands is manifested in oppositional and
behaviors. These individuals resent having to conform to the standards set
by others. On the other hand, they fear direct confrontation. The
of resentment and fear leads to passive, provocative behavior (as in the
case of the subject Choate and Sunder exchange- wherein subject Choate
Sunder and seeks to create a situation in which Sunder will escalate the
Individuals with PAPD view themselves as self-sufficient but feel
to control and interference from others (Pretzer & Beck, Clarkin &
eds., 1996, p. 60). They believe that they are misunderstood and
a view that is exacerbated by the negative responses they receive from
others for their consistent defeatist stance. They expect the worst in
even situations that are going well, and are inclined toward anger and
irritability (Beck & Freeman, 1990, p. 339) (DSM-IV, 1994, p. 734).
Choate demonstrates this classically, particularly in the context of his
often sardonically defeatist and pessimistic inclusions in the titles of
Individuals with PAPD are often disgruntled and declare that they are not
treated as they should be. On the other hand, they are just as likely to
express feeling unworthy of good fortune. They have a basic conflict
their self-worth; they oscillate between self-loathing and entitlement or
moral superiority. Either side of this oscillation can be projected onto
the environment. The chaotic nature of this experience of self and others
often leads to people beginning to avoid or minimize contact with people
with PAPD out of self-protection (Richards, 1993, p. 259).
Individuals with PAPD see others as intrusive, demanding, interfering,
and dominating. They believe that other people interfere with their
They experience control by others as intolerable; they have to do things
their own way (Pretzer & Beck, Clarkin & Lenzenweger, eds., 1996, p. 60).
These individuals are determined that they will not be subject to the rules
of others (Beck & Freeman, 1990, p. 227). They resent, oppose, and resist
demands to meet expectations from others in a behavioral pattern seen in
both work and social settings (DSM-IV, 1994, p. 733). Their main coping
strategies are passive resistance, surface submissiveness, evasion, and
circumventing of rules (Pretzer & Beck, Clarkin & Lenzenweger, eds., 1996,
p. 60).
Individuals with passive-aggressive (negativistic) personality disorder
are ambivalent within their relationships and conflicted between their
needs and their desire for self-assertion. They waver between expressing
hostile defiance toward people they see as causing their problems and
to mollify these people by asking forgiveness or promising to do better
in the future (DSM-IV, 1994, p. 734).
These individuals are noted for the stormy nature of their interpersonal
relationships. They engage in a combination of quarrelsomeness and
Their affect is sullen and they engage in deliberate rudeness. They are
resentfully quarrelsome and irritable. They often feel like a victim.
to the disorder is a pervasive pattern of argumentativeness and
behavior with defeatist and negative attitudes (Millon & Radovanov,
ed., 1995, p. 317). Richards (1993, p. 260) believes that PAPD may be the
most miserable personality disorder. These individuals inflict a great deal
of discomfort on others through the use of their anxiety and emotional
They can become so destructive in their attitudes and so unable to provide
rewards to others that they become socially isolated.
For individuals with PAPD, authority figures can become the focus of their
discontentment. They often criticize and voice hostility toward authority
figures with minimal provocation. Their resistance toward authority is
by procrastination, forgetfulness, stubbornness, and intentional
These individuals are also envious of and resentful toward peers who
or are viewed positively by authority figures (DSM-IV, 1994, pp. 733-734).
Authority figures are seen by individuals with passive-aggressive
personality disorder as arbitrary and unfair. When they are faced with the
consequences of not adequately meeting obligations, these individuals will
become angry at those in authority rather than seeing how their own
has contributed to the situation (Beck & Freeman, 1990, p. 339). Authority
figures are defined as intrusive, demanding, interfering, controlling, and
dominating. On the other hand, individuals with PAPD also see authority
figures as capable of being approving, accepting, and caring. A key issue
for individuals with PAPD is the desire to get benefits from authority
while exerting their freedom and autonomy (Beck & Freeman, 1990, p. 45).
The conflict is intense. Individuals with PAPD have a tendency to see any
form of power as inconsiderate and neglectful. They are also likely to
that authorities or caregivers are incompetent, unfair, and cruel.
these individuals are not inclined to rebel directly. They will agree to
comply with demands or suggestions but will often fail to perform (or they
will perform while experiencing increasing resentment). Then, when there
is trouble, these individuals will complain of unfair treatment. They envy
and resent others who manage authority situations and who are able to
to authorities with less difficulty. These individuals believe that their
suffering indicts the negligent caregiver or authority figure. They fear
control in any form but long for nurturing restitution from those they
as having power (Benjamin, 1993, p. 272).
Origins of PAPD in the Subject Choate-
Stone (1993, p. 361) suggests that the contrary, sulking, and verbal
behaviors of PAPD appear to have their origin in unending power struggles
with parents. The comparative helplessness of youth made it impossible to
win in these struggles so the face-saving technique of passive resistance
was employed. Parental overcontrol, neglect, or favoring of a sibling can
all contribute to the development of the silent protest and grudging
associated with PAPD (Stone, 1993, p. 361).
It is reasonable to assume that Subject Choate experienced some level of
paternal angst and the description of unending power struggles seems apt
in this context.
There are two major ways for individuals with PAPD to enter treatment. The
first, and most common, is externally leveraged treatment for those
who do not see themselves as having a problem. Someone forced them into
treatment, e.g., family, employers, or the legal system. These clients with
PAPD have minimal insight; they fail to admit that they are a major factor
in the problems they have. The second method for individuals with PAPD to
enter treatment is via self-referral for vague complaints, e.g. "I'm just
not getting anywhere" (Turkat, 1990, pp. 87-88).
All of the personality disorders are composed mostly of abrasive traits
that are negative in nature. Maladaptive traits are usually favored over
adaptive traits (though there are adaptive traits within all personality
disorders) (Kantor, 1992, p. 10). PAPD is a particularly abrasive
and interpersonal problems are readily identifiable. However, individuals
with PAPD do not frequently seek treatment for relationship issues as they
consistently blame others for the problems they have. Even if they do come
in for treatment for a marital or parent and child problem, they will
demand that the treatment providers "fix" the other person or persons who
are at fault for the problems within the relationship.
Treatment for individuals with PAPD involves openly exploring the ways they
indirectly and unassertively express aggression and neediness toward others
by being contrary. Understanding this aggression can allow discovery of
the depressive and invalidating experiences underneath -- which lead to
a fear of loss of autonomy when others want to be close and a fear of loss
of connectedness when others want to be alone (Kubacki & Smith, Retzlaff,
 ed., 1995, p. 175).
This author believes that Subject Choate is unlikely to seek treatment
and should be compelled to seek treatment in whatever fashion is most
to produce results.
Study continues...

A common countertransference issue with these clients is outrage or
anger. They are manipulative individuals who are consistently stubborn,
demanding, help-rejecting, critical, and inclined to ridicule both the
process and the service providers.  Subject Choate has predictably
in exactly this fashion to the onset of treatment.
Identify all avoidance and anxiety-arousing situations. Address these
with anxiety-management behavioral intervention techniques (Turkat, 1990,
 pp. 88-89). Cognitive therapy can help these individuals understand that
they expect the worst from others and then proceed to behave in such a way
that brings out the worst from these same people (Stone, 1993, p. 363).
Group therapy provides individuals with PAPD with an opportunity to learn
how to manage their hostility. When their hostility emerges, group leaders
can comment on hostile behavior and encourage other group members to
The group leader can assist these individuals to process what it is they
want or need at that moment and to rehearse appropriate behavior within
the group context (Ries, TIP  1994, p. 72).

Clearing	Framework
, xmlx I'm happy to announce the first public release of NeuDist
NeuDist is an Open Source Software framework for building applications
for the Neubia Distributed Clearing Platform.
This release contains early java libraries and documentation that would
primarily be of interest to developers.
Talking about documentation, it is still a bit slim and mainly oriented
towards people with experience in Java/XML development.
There are currently no sample applications, but they will be available
in the next release.
The framework currently contains the following:
- Classes for creating "Named Objects", which are authenticated using
digital signatures within a hierarchy.
- Storage framework for "Named Objects".
- Simple XML-Signature implementation (Almost certainly not yet
interoperable with other implementations)
- Simple SOAP client
- Simple Servlet API for handling SOAP requests based on "Named
  Objects".
- Current types of "Named Objects" include:
    NameSpace objects -- for maintaining the NameSpace Authentication
 	Framework
    AuthenticationTickets -- for doing web site authentication using
Next major release is scheduled to contain:
 - Core:
 - Signing Services:
 - Example User Authentication Application
 - Example Payment System based on NeuDist
I will be expanding the documentation over the next few weeks. This will
cover not only more indepth technical documentation, but also higher
level documentation about the business side of things.

EO 13526 CLASSIFIED NATIONAL SECURITY INFORMATION AND IMPLEMENTING DIRECTIVE
PART 1. DESCRIPTION OF SELF-INSPECTION PROGRAM: A description of the
DoD Components self-
inspection program should include activities assessed, program areas
covered, and methodology
utilized. The description must demonstrate how the self-inspection
program provides the senior
agency official with the information necessary to assess the
effectiveness of the classified national
security information program within the individual Component
activities and the Component as a
whole. It should include the following:
1. Responsibility for the program:
(1) Whom does the senior agency official designate to assist in
directing and administering the self-inspection
Answer . The Director of Security and Counterintelligence (DOS&CI) is
provided a Letter of Instruction by the
Director, NRO which assigns his responsibilities.
(2) How is the program structured to provide the senior agency
official with the information necessary to assess the
agency's classified national security information program?
Answer: The DOS&CI advises the Senior Agency Official (SAO) when the
DOS&CI believes events warrant
advising the SAO. The NRO Integrated Security Assessment Program
(ISAP) results are also reported to the SAO
thru the annual Management Control Plan Statement of Assurance (MCPSOA).
(b)(3) 10 USC 424
(3) Who conducts the self-inspections?
Answer: NRO self-inspections are part of the NRO ISAP. Because
contractors make upgAof the total NRO
workforce and have the overwhelming number of Sensitive Compartmented
Information Facilities (SCIFs), ISAP is
a collaborative process between Government and industry to identifi ,
and address security vulnerabilities, provide
e tmcuriyseand.Th
may lead to identification and
definition of risk mitigation practices, and enable sharing of best
security practices across government and
industry. The primary purpose of the ISAP is to ensure the proper
safeguarding of classified information through a
single comprehensive review by various components of the Office of
Security and Counterintelligence (OS&CI).
ISAP integrates reviews utilizing program security, classification
management, transportation and transmission of
classified information, physical and technical accreditation,
information systems security, personnel security, and
Counterintelligence (CI) perspectives. The integrated assessment
evaluates implementation of and ensures
compliance with, established security policies, procedures, and plans
at all NRO government and contractor
Site personnel conduct/document security self-assessments per
requirements stated in the NRO Security Manual
(NSM). Security Officers will conduct self-assessments of their SCIFs
at least annually. For the reporting period
there were 343 site self-assessments. The ISAP Manager or designee
reviews the site assessments and enters a
copy into an NRO database listing each NRO sponsored facility.
Based on the self-assessments, the ISAP Manager, Program Security
Officers (PSOs) and stakeholders discuss
findings and formulate recommendations for a formal assessment, if
required OS&CI stakeholders represent the
major OS&CI divisions and program office security staffs, including,
but not limited to, PSOs, Physical/Technical
Certification Officers, and Security Certification Officers.
Stakeholders will develop and provide ISAP candidates
to the ISAP Selection Board. Each ISAP recommendation shall contain
detailed factors used to formulate the
recommendation. Recommendation for site visits is then provided to the
selection board Sites are selected based
on ring proximity, resources, budgetary constraints, time since last
assessment, and random sampling. A team
composition is proposed for each site visit and a Lead PSO is selected
The Assessment Team will, at a minimum,
consist of a Government PSO and an OS&Cl/Facilities and Information
Security Division (F&ISD) representative.
Additional team members will be added as needed based on site size,
mission, facility risk, and subject areas being
assessed. An out-briefing is provided to site security site - and
other site senior management identfying security
program successes, observations, and any security "best practices"
discovered during the formal assessment. The
results are then loaded into the facility database that contains
information from all previous visits with any problem
areas or "best practices" noted. A final report requiring corrective
actionsto be taken within 90 days of the date of

report is issued by the DOS&CI. The assessed site is required to
provide follow-up reports of corrective action to
the responsible PSO and the ISAP Manager every 90 days until all
corrective actions are complete. The
responsible PSO monitors all mitigation actions. Reports of corrective
action are loaded into the NRO facilities
database for historical purposes. For the reporting period, 16 formal
team assessments were performed An
additional 9 formal specific-issue reviews were conducted There were
an additional 1,491 visits by OS&CI
stakeholders to contractor SCIFs.
(4) How is the senior agency official involved in the program?
Answer: The DOS&CI keeps the SAO advised of trends and issues
developed by the ISAP. The NRO ISAP results
are also reported to the SAO thru the annual MCPSOA.
2. Approach:
(1) What means and methods are employed in conducting self-inspections?
Answer: For formal assessments, the Assessment Team evaluates
implementation, and ensures compliance with,
established NRO security policies, procedures, and plans.
(2) Are different types of self-inspections conducted? If so, describe
each of them.
Answer: Formal assessments will vary based on the experience of the
lead PSO and the stakeholders with the
facility and items noted in the self-evaluation report as well as the
areas of responsibility of the attending subject
matter experts. However, the objective for all is to identify and
address security vulnerabilities, provide data for
analysis, and identift system security issues and trends.
(3) Do the self-inspections evaluate adherence to the principles and
requirements of E.O. 13526 and its implementing
directive and the effectiveness of agency programs covering:
Ã¢â¬Â¢ Original classification?
Answer: Since Original Classification items only apply to 13
government employees who are Original
Classification Authorities (OCA) at NRO Headquarters, a formal tasking
is sent to Program Security Officers
supporting the OCA to determine the date the OCA received their annual
briefing and the number of original
classification decisions they made during the reporting period.
Experience has shown that not all of the OCAs
make individual OCA decisions every year but most require their
authority to sign classification guides for
their area of responsibility. For the reporting period there, nine OCA
decisions were made.
Derivative classification?
Answer: Included. In NRO Implementing Instructions released on 31 May
2011, derivative classifiers were
instructed to include in the classification block a personal
identification number rather than their name to
protect their identity and association with the NRO. This
"Classification ID (CLID)" number exists in the
NRO Access Database so the specific individual with that number can
always be identyled Employees of other
agencies, who already have an ID number assigned by their parent
agency, will use that number instead
Headquarters NRO derivative classifiers have their PSO available for
questions regarding classification and
marking and to review their derivatively classified documents for
format and accuracy of classffication and
marking. Available on the OS&CI website are the Order, Information
Security Oversight Office (IS00)
Implementing Directive and Marking booklet, videos and documents that
explain the correct way to classify
and mark documents, the Controlled Access Program Coordination Office
(CAPCO) register and manual, over
120 Frequently Asked Questions with answers that are posted about
portion marking a Security Policy hotline
that will answer their questions in real-time, and numerous other
experts who are available to answer their
questions. Once the document is distributed, they face additional
scrutiny from any security or classification
management officer who reads it or from subject matter experts who
point out classification and marking
errors to security officers.
The ISAP team visiting a site will review a sample of derivatively
classified documents to point out errors in
classification and marking, omissions of required information, and to
make suggestions for improvement.
Answer: The NRO has a formal declassification program which restricts
to one office the authority to officially
declassify NRO information and release it to the public, and which is
not included in the self-inspection
program. The results of this program are reported in the SF 311 report
provided to USD(I) in October 2012.
The NRO Declassification Guide (known as the Review and Redaction
Guide) is updated and approved by the

(4) Do the self-inspections include a review of relevant security
directives and instructions, as well as interviews with
producers and users of classified information?
Answer: All directives and instructions are issued by the DOS&Cl and
are reviewed and updated annually. All
directives and instructions are maintained on-line and are accessible
to all government employees and contractors.
(5) Do the self-inspections include reviews of representative samples
of your Component's original and derivative
classification actions?
Ã¢â¬Â¢ Do these reviews encompass all Component activities that generate
classified information?
Answer: There are hundreds of individual activities that can generate
classified information. While the annual
self-assessment questionnaire covers 343 of these activities, the ISAP
formal assessment inspects only a small
percentage of these activities yearly. However, the Program Security
Officers, Contractor Program Security
Officers, and Classification Specialists review hundreds of classified
documents yearly and provide direction to
originators to correct those that are improperly marked.
o How do you identify the activities to which this applies?
Answer: Site personnel conduct/document security self-assessments per
requirements stated in the NSM
Ã¢â¬Â¢ Do the reviews include a sampling of various types of classified
information in document and electronic
o How do you ensure that the materials reviewed provide a
representative sample of the Component's
classified information?
Answer: Documents are selected for review in cooperation with site
personnel who are familiar with the type
of materials produced by the site. However, contractors are not
required to count classified pages produced
because of the additional costs that would be incurred by the NRO, so
the documents reviewed may not be a
representative sample.
o How do you determine that the sample is proportionally sufficient to
enable a credible assessment of your
Component's classified product?
Answer: We do not attempt to do this as it would increase costs to the
NRO (as explained above).
Ã¢â¬Â¢ Who conducts the review of the classified products?
o Are they knowledgeable of the classification and marking
requirements of E.O. 13526 and its
implementing directive?
Answer: Yes
o Do they have access to pertinent security classification guides?
Answer: Yes
Ã¢â¬Â¢ Have appropriate personnel been designated to correct
misclassification actions? If so, identify.
Answer: All Program Security Officers and Classification Managemeni
Specialists are authorized to correct
misclassification, incorrect use of SCI channels, and incorrect
dissemination restrictions.
(1) How frequently are self-inspections conducted?
Answer: Annually.
(2) What factors were considered in establishing this time period?
Answer: Time period is defined in the NSM.

4. Coverage:
(1) How do you determine what program elements and Component
activities are covered by your self-inspection
Answer: Self-assessments are to be completed on each contractor SCIF.
(2) What Component activities are assessed?
Answer: All contractor activities are assessed.
(3) How is the program structured to assess individual Component
activities and the Component as a whole?
Answer: Contractor locations far outnumber government locations in the
NRO. Government locations are
relatively few in number and have professional government security
officers assigned who can monitor
safeguarding and classified information production and correct errors
as they occur. We chose to concentrate on
contractorfacilities which are visited relatively infrequently. The
conditions at contractor locations are not directly
applicable to government locations.
(4) If your Component has any special access programs (SAP), are
self-inspections of the SAP programs conducted
Answer: Most SAPs are reviewed as part of the ISAP program. The ISAP
formal assessment team has PSOs
assigned that are briefed for most SAPs. In addition. the NRO conducts
special annual reviews (in some cases.
semi-annual) of the entire Sensitive Activities portfolio.
Do the self-inspections confirm that the Component head or principal
deputy has reviewed each special access
program annually to determine if it continues to meet the requirements
of E.O. 13526?
Answer: The NRO's entire Sensitive Activities portfolio is reviewed
and briefed annually to the DNI's Senior
Review Group (SRG) who then reports to Congress.
Do the self-inspections determine if officers and employees are aware
of the prohibitions and sanctions for
creating or continuing a special access program contrary to the
requirements of E.O. 13526?
Answer: Yes. In keeping with E.O. 13526, all Sensitive Activities'
compartments that are established
terminated, or transitioned (to another program or lower
classification) require NRO Special Activities
Management Board review and approval, followed by notification to the
DNI's Senior Review
Group/Controlled Access Program Oversight Committee.
5. Reporting:
(1) What format for documenting self-inspections in your Component?
Answer: Self assessments are documented using the self-assessment
review tool in the NSM, Appendix B. For
formal assessments, an out-briefing is provided to site security staff
and other site senior management identi&ing
security program successes, observations, and any security "best
practices" discovered during the formal
assessment. The results are then loaded into the facility database
that contains information from all previous visits
with any problem areas or "best practices" noted A final report
requiring corrective actions to be taken within 90
days of the date of report is issued by the DOS&CI. The assessed site
is required to provide follow-up reports of
corrective action to the responsible PSO and the ISAP Manager every 90
days until all corrective actions are
complete. The responsible PSO monitors all mitigation actions. Reports
of corrective action are loaded into the
NRO facilities database for historical purposes.
(2) Who receives the reports?
Answer: The OS&CI ISAP Manager.
(3) Who compiles/analyzes the reports?
Answer: The ISAP Manager and the responsible PSO analyze the report.
How are the findings analyzed to determine if there are problems of a
systemic nature?
Answer: The ISAP Manager provides to the sponsoring Government Program
Security Officer (GPSO) for review
and subsequent action.
(5) How and when are the results of the self-inspections reported to
the senior agency official?
Answer: The DOS&CI determines when results warrant informing the SAO.
(6) How is it determined if corrective actions are required?
Answer: The GPSO and security stalceholder(s) review.

PART 2. ASSESSMENT & SUMMARY:
The assessment is an evaluation of the state of each element of your componenVs
classified national security information program based on an analysis
of the findings of the selfinspection program. It should consider if
the program element is being effectively implemented in
accordance with the Order and Directive and DoD 5200.01-M. It should
consider whether the
findings indicate that the regulation or other policies or procedures
may need to be updated, and
it should take into account other program information such as the
Standard Form 311, "Agency
Security Classification Management Program Data." If a particular
element does not apply to a
component (e.g., original classification authority) the report should
explain this.

PART 3. FOCUS QUESTIONS:
FOCUS QUESTIONS: Answer the following focus questions.
(1) Training for original classification authorities. (This applies
only to Components
with original classification authority).
(1) Original classification authorities are required to receive
training in proper classification and declassification each
calendar year (5200.01-V?). What percentage of the original
classification authorities at your Component has
received this training?
(2) Have any waivers to this requirement been granted?
Answer: 100% of NRO OCAs have received training. No waivers have been granted.
FOCUS QUESTIONS: Answer the following focus questions.
(2) Training for persons who apply derivative classification markings.
(1) Persons who apply derivative classification markings are required
to receive training in the proper application of the
derivative classification principles of the E0 13526 prior to
derivatively classifying information and at least once
every two years thereafter. What percentage of the derivative
classifiers at your Component has received this
(2) Have waivers to this requirement been granted?
Answer: Percentage unknown. The DSS and CAPCO Derivative Classifier
training is available through the
NRO computer network; however, NRO has not made this training
mandatory because of the cost of two
hours of direct labor charged by each contractor. No waivers have been granted.
FOCUS QUESTIONS: Answer the following focus questions.
(3) Initial training.
(1) All cleared agency personnel are required to receive initial

Public Key Infrastructure: An Artifact Ill-Fitted to the Needs of the
Information Society
It has been conventional wisdom that, for e-commerce to fulfill its
potential, each party to a transaction must be confident in the identity of
the others. Digital signature technology, based on public key cryptography,
has been claimed as the means whereby this can be achieved. Digital
signatures do little, however, unless a substantial infrastructure is in
place to provide a basis for believing that the signature means something
of significance to the relying party.
Conventional, hierarchical PKI, built around the ISO standard X.509, has
been, and will continue to be, a substantial failure. This paper examines
that form of PKI architecture, and concludes that it is a very poor fit to
the real needs of cyberspace participants. The reasons are its inherently
hierarchical and authoritarian nature, the unreasonable presumptions it
makes about the security of private keys, a range of other technical
defects, confusions about what it is that a certificate actually
authenticates, and its inherent privacy-invasiveness. Alternatives are

@_subject: Honeytrap reveals mass monitoring of downloaders (Paul Marks) 
Paul Marks, *New Scientist*, 4 Sep 2012, via Dave Farber's IP
Anyone who has downloaded pirated music, video or ebooks using a BitTorrent
client has probably had their IP address logged by copyright-enforcement
authorities within 3 hours of doing so. So say computer scientists who
placed a fake pirate server online - and very quickly found monitoring
systems checking out who was taking what from the servers.
The news comes from this week's SecureComm conference in Padua, Italy, where
computer security researcher Tom Chothia and his colleagues at the
University of Birmingham, UK, revealed they have discovered "massive
monitoring" of BitTorrent download sites, such as the PirateBay, has been
taking place for at least three years.
BitTorrent is a data distribution protocol that splits an uploaded digital
media file into many parts and shares it around a swarm of co-operating
servers. Birmingham's fake server acted like a part of a file-sharing swarm
and the connections made to it quickly revealed the presence of file-sharing
monitors run by "copyright enforcement organisations, security companies and
even government research labs". ...

[priv]
[Disclaimer: I was involved with the Reason article. --Declan]
Putting 40,000 Readers, One by One, on a Cover
DAVID CARR
Published: April 5, 2004
When the 40,000 subscribers to Reason, the monthly libertarian magazine,
receive a copy of the June issue, they will see on the cover a satellite
photo of a neighborhood - their own neighborhood. And their house will
be graphically circled.
On one level, the project, sort of the ultimate in customized
publishing, is unsurprising: of course a magazine knows where its
subscribers live. But it is still a remarkable demonstration of the
growing number of ways databases can be harnessed. Apart from the cover
image, several advertisements are customized to reflect the recipient's
Nick Gillespie, editor in chief of Reason, said the magazine, with an
editorial mission of "Free Minds, Free Markets,'' used the stunt to
illustrate the cover article about the power and importance of
"Our story is man bites dog," Mr. Gillespie said. "Everybody, including
our magazine, has been harping on the erosion of privacy and the fears
of a database nation. It is a totally legit fear. But they make our
lives unbelievably easier as well, in terms of commercial transactions,
credit, you name it."
Rodger Cosgrove, president of Entremedia, a direct marketing firm and a
member of Reason's board, assisted in coming up with a program that
allows the subscriber list to be integrated with satellite photographs.
He also worked with Xeikon, the manufacturer of the printer that made
the endless customization possible.

New York - The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) today urged a New York
state court to respect Mexican court rulings that have disallowed lawsuits
against independent journalist Al Giordano for publishing allegations of
drug trafficking by Banco Nacional de Mexico President Roberto Hernandez
EFF seeks to protect the First Amendment rights of online, independent
journalists against the abusive "shopping" by large, powerful corporations
for favorable jurisdictions. The Mexican bank brought the case against a
Mexican-based website, produced solely by Giordano, the Narco News Bulletin:
"The EFF is concerned that the bank resorted to New York courts to try to
shut down this website because it could not do so in Mexican courts," said
Cindy Cohn, Legal Director for the EFF. "This kind of forum shopping
threatens to shut down one of the greatest benefits of the Internet --
giving a voice to independent, Internet-based journalists. Faced with having
to defend themselves in far-flung jurisdictions, many independent
journalists will simply choose not to publish on the Internet."
The case arises from allegations published on the the Narco News Bulletin
website that the bank president was involved in illegal activities in
Mexico. The EFF filed an amicus brief urging the New York court to rule that
it was improper for the bank to force Mr. Giordano into New York state court
for the statements posted on the website. The hearing on the case is set for
July 20, 2001.
Since April 18, 2000, Al Giordano has produced the Narco News Bulletin, an
online newspaper devoted to spirited investigative journalism on the
US-Latin America drug trade. Articles posted on the Narco News Bulletin
website have discussed allegations by others that Roberto Hernandez Ramirez,
the president of the Banco Nacional de Mexico, is involved in drug
trafficking. Some of these stories were reprinted articles from the Mexican
newspaper Por Esto!, published in Mexico by Mario Renato Menendez.
After failing three times to successfully sue Menendez in Mexico over the
allegations, Banco Nacional de Mexico now seeks to force Menendez and
Giordano to defend themselves in New York state court against the same basic
claims. The New York case groups together the allegations against the
Mexican-based website, hosted in Maryland, with statements made by Menendez
and Giordano in New York City on a radio broadcast and at a Columbia
University Law School conference.
The EFF amicus brief asked the Court to adopt one of two courses of action.
First, in order to deter abusive forum shopping, the EFF asked the court to
dismiss the case since Mexican law governs the dispute.
Alternatively, since Narconews.com mainly republished investigative work
done by others, the EFF asked the New York court to apply a distinct legal
standard for libel claims related to republished statements. The legal
standard requires that a republisher had, or should have had substantial
reasons to question the accuracy of the articles. EFF believes that this
higher liability standard for republishing on the Internet is necessary to
encourage the growth of Internet journalism.

@_subject: New Legal Briefs: Friday's Hearing Heats Up 
June 17, 2001
Please Spread the Word
Dear Colleagues,
Just a quick note, as we race toward Friday's New York Supreme Court hearing
in the Drug War on Trial case, to let you know that:
- Two new legal briefs are now linked from page one:
(Joint memorandum by Narco News Bulletin and I, and my own sworn affidavit
about the latest court Exhibit, "The Mexico Papers" with lots of interesting
drug war facts)
- Tomorrow we shall post the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) amicus
brief in support of Narco News' motion to dismiss the Banamex lawsuit.
- At press time, we have heard of another amicus (friend-of-the-court) brief
being filed on our behalf, and as soon as we receive it, we will post and
announce it.
Apologies for being so brief about the briefs. For a pro se defendant, this
is worse than cramming for the bar exam.
from somewhere else in a country called Amï¿½rica,
Al Giordano

Why a separate WWW box issued a copy, I dunno.
There's about a dozen of the WWW boxes

I found the FTU's recent report on concealable weapons
( interesting,
but find that it omitted a few possibilities, viz:
1. The pop-top steel lid on a can e.g., of catfood forms a sharp
edge when removed.  (I have a permenant scar on a finger
attesting to this.)  If half the disc were grasped in a cloth
it could be more effective than several of the items you list.
2. Similarly, the steel lid on e.g., a tuna can forms a sharp (and
flatter, and slightly more rigid) edge when removed with a can opening
tool.  A can opening tool can be very small, e.g., the military-style
can openers, which by itself is not dangerous.  Again, any piece of cloth forms a graspable handle on the resulting sharp-edged disc.
3. Even a beverage can, e.g., from a beer purchased in flight, can be
ripped into a sharp edge, although the thinness of the (typically soft
aluminum) metal makes this less effective than the above.
4. The large knitting (crochet) needles which I believe
the TSA admits could be filed into a sharp point, producing
a spike as effective as some you list.  As these are typically
aluminum, abrading them into a point would not be difficult.
5. It is possible that a skilled knife maker could chip a glass
bottle into a knife while in the restroom, producing something
comparable to the obsidian knife you list.  The production process
might be noisy however, unlike the above.
Comment, which you will no doubt ignore:
Given the facility with which weapons are improvised or concealed,
it might be a better idea to stop motivating the
actors, as distasteful as that might be to some in power.
Although some will enjoy the Israel-like police
state that foreign entanglement will otherwise drag the US
into, and some -perhaps your- careers might even advance faster
under such conditions.
Have a nice day

@_subject: Schneier: Why Digital Signatures are not Signatures (was 
The Word example actually has other worrying problems not mentioned. A Word
document contains a lot of hidden information, including other versions. It
would be quite easy to sign a Word document that, when you viewed it, looks
significantly different then it could be displayed without violating the
signature. This is due to numerous problems, the most basic of which is that
we often don't sign what we view but instead some binary that we _believe_
represents what we viewed but often does not. This is not just theoretical
nor esoteric, but quite easy as the Word example shows.
In effect we have absolutely no idea what we are signing most of the time
even without comprimise of keys, programs and all that good stuff.

It's still early in the game to be so certain. But if you are right,
that in it self is an indictment of PKI. If there really is a market
for trust establishment and a form of PKI is the low cost producer of
trust, then someone should be able to make money by using their
expertise to assemble a technology suite and sell trust insurance
based on the spread between the risk perceived by the market and what
they know to be a lower risk. If such services never develop, it
either means there is no market or PKI doesn't have enough economic
impact to cover the costs of starting such a business.

And the annoying thing about this is that once we go to
needing an online trusted third party to allow us to have
secure communications, we may as well chuck the public key
stuff and just use symmetric ciphers and the key exchange
protocols worked out ten or fifteen years ago.  Which makes
me suspect that we're just not using public key mechanisms
very intelligently yet.  We've realized that screws are
better for many jobs than nails, it's just that they're so
damned hard to hammer in....
