When one disregards the emotional loading of the terms, one can see there is
no difference between a government charging a person taxes and a 'mafia'
charging a person "protection money." These entities offer physical
protection from other competing entities of the same type.
The reason why governments and 'mafia' are/have been so abusive of
individuals right in their territies is the lack of sufficient competition
brought about by major barriers to entry in this market. These barriers have gotten worse throughout history. In the 18th Century one
could challenge a "protection provider" through direct action with muskets
and little else. Today one needs significantly more resources (advanced
weaponry -- RPGs, SAMs, etc) to effectively challenge a 'protection
provider' through direct action.
Ideally, governments need to be decoupled from geographical territories, so

government no matter where she is located.
