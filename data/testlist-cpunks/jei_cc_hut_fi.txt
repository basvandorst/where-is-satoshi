Microsoft, cDc and FBI Cut a Deal: FBI Surveillance Software to be Part of Windows XP Updates By John Robbington
The controversy, rumours and speculation surrounding the FBI's Magic
Lantern tool has attracted ridicule from the internet underground.
Not so any more. Now both the infamous hacker group the Cult of the Dead
Cow (cDc) and Microsoft have offered a helping hand to the Feds and are
preparing to include the surveillance software in all future editions and
updates of the new Microsoft Windows XP operating system.
"This Magic Lantern could easily become a part of Windows XP Dynamic
Updates, or even become a standard part of the operating system."  Microsoft spokesperson Bob Null said. "We are really looking forward to
experimenting this on a large scale. Our direct Marketing department was
jumping out of their pants when they heard we would be doing this." As
well they should. - The dreams of both direct marketers and FBI agents

Both Microsoft and FBI point out that individual profiles are
not given a name and that the information is stored on the FBI
government computers only and not on public computers. But this holds little sway with privacy advocates.

for a biometric system which identifies different individuals within the

IDs each time, which have the effect of identifying all the household's PC
users, even if they didn't write anything that would otherwise indicate
to FBI and Microsoft who is using the computer.

Bush administration seeks to relax curbs on FBI domestic spying
By Kate Randall
18 December 2001
Attorney General John Ashcroft is considering relaxing restrictions on the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) that limit spying on political
organizations, churches and other groups in the United States. If put into
effect, the change in FBI rules would constitute a fundamental loosening of
curbs on the agencyÂs domestic intelligence operations, and would allow the
government to spy on groups and individuals solely because of their
political beliefs.
Ashcroft said the proposed change is part of the effort to shift the axis of
Justice Department activity from the prosecution of crime to the prevention
of terrorism. In the wake of the September 11 events, the Bush
administration has issued a rash of executive orders that attack basic
democratic rights and challenge civil liberties long protected by the US
Constitution. These orders have included the authorization of secret
military tribunals to try alleged terrorists; the roundup of more than a
thousand mainly Middle Eastern men, some of them detained indefinitely and
in secret; and the authorization of eavesdropping on attorney-client
conversations of those in custody.
The new Justice Department proposal poses a particular threat to the civil
liberties of any individual or political organization that opposes the
domestic or foreign policy of the government. The loosening of restrictions
would allow the FBI to spy on groups or individualsÂincluding the use of
ÂrovingÂ wiretaps and e-mail surveillanceÂwithout providing a judge with
proof of Âprobable cause.Â Presently, meetings of political groups, services
at mosques or churches and other private gatherings are off-limits to the
FBI unless it can prove the likelihood that a crime is in progress.
Widespread domestic spying was carried out in the 1960s and Â70s as part of
the FBIÂs notorious COINTELPRO (counter-intelligence program) operation.
Under then-FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, COINTELPRO targeted black
nationalists, civil rights activists and opponents of the Vietnam War. Those
under surveillance included boxer Muhammad Ali, actress Jane Fonda, Dr.
Benjamin Spock, Dr. Martin Luther King and the Black Panther Party, among
many others.
The FBI carried out a vicious campaign for almost 20 years against opponents
of government policy, utilizing such methods as illegal wiretaps, blackmail
and forgery, extortion and in some cases outright murder. FBI agents were
also involved in incitement to violence in their work in racist
organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan.
When the FBIÂs widespread surveillance methods began to be exposed in the
1970s, Congress was obliged to carry out an investigation into the agencyÂs
spying activities and methods. In the wake of this probe, the bureau adopted
internal guidelines prohibiting agents from using charges of subversion or
the threat of terrorism to justify the monitoring of AmericansÂ political
activities. Ashcroft now wants to rewrite the FBI code of conduct to allow
the agency to resume spying on its domestic political opponents.
COINTELPROÂs dirty record
An examination of two COINTELPRO cases makes clear the ominous implications
of AshcroftÂs proposal, and the dangers posed to democratic rights by the
revival of these methods.
One of the most infamous cases of FBI infiltration was in connection with
the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama,
which left four young girls dead and injured another 22 adults and children.
The racially motivated bombing was the twenty-first in eight years and the
third in only 11 days, following federal orders to integrate the cityÂs
public schools.
As early as 1964, FBI agents in the KKK identified four men in the 16th
Street Church bombing. However FBI Director Hoover, a fervent opponent of
civil rights, blocked their prosecution. The case was eventually shut down
in 1968 with no charges being filed against the KKK members.
The FBI maintained its network of agents inside the Birmingham KKK following
the bombing, including one of its most notorious informants, Gary T. Rowe,
who later admitted to involvement in violent assaults on blacks. These
included the 1961 attack on Freedom Riders at the Birmingham bus station and
the 1965 murder of Viola Liuzzo, a 39-year-old civil rights activist from
Detroit. The Justice Department later acknowledged it had known about RoweÂs
connection to these racist attacks, but claimed it had no evidence linking
him to the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing.
The FBI finally reopened the case in 1996, leading to the indictment in 2000
of two KKK members, Thomas Blanton and Bobby Cherry, on first-degree and
reckless murder charges. Cherry was ruled mentally incompetent to stand
trial, but Blanton was finally convicted last May of four counts of
first-degree murder.
Another COINTELPRO case involved FBI infiltration of the Black Panther
Party. Elmer ÂGeronimoÂ Pratt was arrested and charged with the
kidnap-murder of Los Angeles schoolteacher Caroline Olsen. Olsen and her
husband were attacked on a tennis court in Santa Monica, California in 1968
by two black men; she was abducted and killed. Her husband Kenneth
identified Pratt as one of the assailants three years later from a photo
provided by the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD).
Geronimo Pratt was framed up as part of the FBI vendetta against the Black
Panthers. The main witness against him was Julius Butler, who had functioned
as an informant for both the FBI and LAPD inside the Panthers. Butler had
been expelled from the group by Pratt because he advocated violence.
At trial, Butler testified that Pratt had confessed to the murder of
Caroline Olsen. The FBI closed its file on Butler during the trial so that
he could deny being an informer when questioned. He resumed his informing
activities after the trial. Pratt was convicted of kidnapping and murder in
1972 and served 27 years in jail for a crime he did not commit before
finally being released in 1999. A Superior Court judge in California ruled
that his conviction should be overturned due to misconduct by the Los
Angeles district attorneyÂs office.
These two cases give only a glimpse of the types of domestic
counterintelligence methods the Bush administration now wants to revive. As
with the majority of provisions enacted since September 11 in the name of
the Âwar on terrorismÂÂmost of them by executive fiatÂthey pose a threat to
the civil liberties not only of alleged terrorists but the American
population as a whole.
The proposed change in spying guidelines would mean political groups could
be targeted for surveillance simply because the government designates them
as ÂsubversiveÂ due to their political views. Such groups could include
left-wing or socialist parties, workers organizations, civil rights
advocates or anyone who speaks out against government policy.
Former FBI Director Louis Freeh gave an indication of what types of
organizations could be targeted for accelerated domestic spying as a result
of relaxed regulations on the FBI. In speech on May 10, 2001, Freeh said,
ÂDomestic terrorist groups represent interests that span the full spectrum
of political and economic viewpoints, as well as social issues and
 concerns.Â
The former FBI chief included in his list of groups that could be designated
as terrorist by the government ÂAnarchists and extremist socialist
groupsÂmany of which, such as the WorkersÂ World Party, Reclaim the Streets
and Carnival Against CapitalismÂhave an international presence and, at
times, also represent a potential threat in the United States.Â

ANALYSIS: CIA poised for unprecedented involvement in domestic
Copyright Â© 2001
Christian Science Monitor Service
Special Report: America Responds
By ABRAHAM McLAUGHLIN, Christian Science Monitor
WASHINGTON (December 17, 2001 12:09 p.m. EST) - The Central Intelligence
Agency has been given new freedom to get involved in domestic surveillance
and investigations in ways that are unprecedented in its history.
The CIA's intelligence gathering has long been kept as separate as possible
from domestic law enforcement, which is bound by strict evidence-gathering
rules and legal safeguards protecting the rights of those investigated.
But as the nation girds itself against global terrorism carried out on
American soil, the barriers between covert, stealthy intelligence and
by-the-book domestic law enforcement investigations are beginning to melt.
Suddenly, for instance, the CIA will now have access to testimony collected
by federal grand juries.
And the CIA, FBI, and other federal agencies are, for the first time, being
allowed to share vast amounts of information ranging from phone records and
credit cards statements to profiles of suspected terrorists.
These shrinking restraints come as new anti-terrorism legislation adopted
this fall grants the FBI far broader wiretapping and other investigative
And while many see the new cooperation as essential in combating the
enormous threat, for others it raises civil-liberties concerns - and
resurrects dark memories of CIA monitoring of domestic groups, including
1970s anti-war protesters.
Those domestic intrusions drove Congress and the president to tighten
restrictions dating back to the 1947 creation of the CIA that bar the agency
from any "domestic police function."
"Traditionally, there's been a sharp demarcation between FBI and CIA turf
... but now there's more ambiguity," says Loch Johnson, author of "America's
Secret Power: The CIA in a Democratic Society."
One of the most-significant changes is the CIA and other government
agencies' new access to one of the most powerful domestic investigative
tools - federal grand-jury proceedings - under the USA Patriot Act, which
passed in the wake of Sept. 11. Now, if any grand-jury investigation
involves matters of "foreign intelligence or counterintelligence" its fruits
may be shared with relevant federal agencies, the statute reads.
"That's a big change in criminal law," notes Robert Davis, founder of the
University of Mississippi's Journal of National Security Law.
Critics worry that "foreign intelligence" information is a very broad
category that extends far beyond just fighting terrorism. They also worry
the information flow won't just be one way. Instead, the CIA may eventually
suggest certain avenues for investigation.
Defenders of the change argue prosecutors will be zealous about defending
their grand-jury proceedings from outside interference.
What really worries critics is the CIA's past history of domestic
operations. In the '60s and '70s, for instance, Operation CHAOS included CIA
involvement in spying on U.S. citizens including anti-war protesters, black
militant groups and even congressmen.
President Nixon's White House encouraged these activities, convinced that
foreign powers stood behind anti-war radicals.
Yet advocates of the changes say the present threats on American soil differ
significantly from the domestic snooping conducted by the Nixon
In fact, supporters point out that drastic government measures - such as
Abraham Lincoln's suspension of habeas corpus during the Civil War - have
typically been temporary. Indeed, the most-controversial elements of the USA
Patriot Act do eventually expire.
In the meantime, the stepped-up cooperation is crucial, says Gates, who
argues the relevant historical parallel is not Operation CHAOS but Pearl
In 1941 - as in 2001 - "disparate government agencies had bits of
information" that pointed to an attack.
"But there was no single agency to pull everything together in a coherent
analysis of the threat," Gates says.
The new information sharing is the only way to prepare against new attacks.
The USA Patriot act allows the CIA, FBI, the Border Patrol, and the
Immigration and Naturalization Service to share information broadly. And
it's likely to lead to FBI and CIA agents working closely together here in
the U.S.
This greater cooperation comes at a time of significantly increased federal
investigation powers. For instance, under the PATRIOT act, law enforcement
can now more easily conduct secret searches of homes and businesses, while a
change to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act makes it easier for law
enforcement to obtain wiretaps.
Such activity may help prevent future terrorist acts. But there is also
concern that it will lead to a blending of the intelligence and
law-enforcement cultures.
Yet there are hints it won't be so easy for the two agencies to work
together, given the history of antagonism between the two and the CIA's
reluctance to repeat its past mistakes.
Somehow, experts say, the agencies must strike a tricky balance. "The
concept of keeping them separate makes good sense in general," says
University of Virginia law professor John Norton Moore. But after Sept. 11,
"it's inconceivable not to have the two talking to each other."

Rare lynx hairs found in forests exposed as hoax
   By Audrey Hudson
   THE WASHINGTON TIMES
        Federal and state wildlife biologists planted false evidence of a
   rare cat species in two national forests, officials told The
   Washington Times.
        Had the deception not been discovered, the government likely
   would have banned many forms of recreation and use of natural
   resources in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest and Wenatchee
   National Forest in Washington state.
        The previously unreported Forest Service investigation found that
   the science of the habitat study had been skewed by seven government
   officials: three Forest Service employees, two U.S. Fish and Wildlife
   Service officials and two employees of the Washington Department of
   Fish and Wildlife.
        The officials planted three separate samples of Canadian lynx
   hair on rubbing posts used to identify existence of the creatures in
   the two national forests.
        DNA testing of two of the samples matched that of a lynx living
   inside an animal preserve. The third DNA sample matched that of an
   escaped pet lynx being held in a federal office until its owner
   retrieved it, federal officials said.

IRS Agent Goes Berserk, Assaults Citizen Local Cops, Sheriff Refuse to
by Pat Shannan Dec. 2001
A sign spotted recently over the door of one IRS office says: "Seizure
Fever Â­ Catch It!" Word has it that the IRS agent with the best seizure
rate for the week is rewarded with a brief respite and other job "perks."
Apparently the pressure to hit his weekly plunder bonus was more than one
revenuer could stand, and when he was asked to show the law justifying his
actions, he blew a head gasket.
The Oct. 2 incident occurred when Wiley Davis, an IRS Team Manager from
Colorado, became agitated with Las Vegas resident Ken Nicholson, 37, during
a hearing to discuss an IRS lien against some property owned by Nicholson's
friend, Keith Milbourn. Davis, 45, had been brought in from Denver
specifically for the Milbourn case.
The Las Vegas Tribune first reported the altercation as arising from a tax
dispute involving an IRS lien against some property belonging to Ken
Nicholson. This was inaccurate. Nicholson had gone along as counsel for his
friends, Keith and Shawna Milbourn, and as a witness to the proceedings. It
was Milbourn's case that was in dispute. They had also taken along court
reporter Beatrice Conner, who caught the whole incident on audiotape.
Nicholson had Power of Attorney to speak for Milbourn, 32. Davis was
assisted by a female agent. Throughout the hearing, the two men made it
clear that they were not going to take Davis' word for anything and would
need actual documentation to prove the IRS' stand. Finally, Nicholson said
that they would be willing to pay whatever the IRS claimed Milbourn owed if
Davis could:
1) Produce a Notice and Demand for the tax; and
2) Give a Code Section which made Milbourn liable.
Nicholson said, and witnesses as well as the tape recording concur, that
Davis did not attempt to produce that evidence but instead became visibly
angry, lost his self-control and attacked Nicholson.
Offense is the Best Defense
"Out of nowhere," said Nicholson, "he jumped up out of his chair and came
around the table, grabbed my chair, and began bouncing it up and down. He
shoved it forward and pushed me toward the table. [In the process,] my legs
came apart and were straddling the arm of the chair. With three or four
quick jerks, he yanked the arm of the chair upward and into my groin. Then
he grabbed me and began to physically evict me from the room."
Security officers came in and stopped the melee at the Oakley Boulevard
office of the IRS in Las Vegas.
Court stenographer Beatrice Conner was shocked speechless when Nicholson
was knocked to the floor. "It was totally without provocation," she said.
"He (Davis) was so angry and violent that if he had had a gun, he would
have pulled it out!"
Keith Milbourn, who witnessed the whole meeting and scuffle, gave more
"By the time we called the police there were about ten people in the
hallway including other agents, the witnesses and security guards,"
Milbourn told us, adding that the other IRS agent who was in the room,
Renee Swells, was "surprised and shocked" by Davis' action. Swells was
unavailable for comment.
Milbourn and Nicholson had called 911 "and the cops arrived in five minutes
all gung-ho and ready to arrest Ken. However, when they heard the tape
played back, they all fell silent, not knowing what to do."
So the officers did nothing. No arrest was made.
Both men said they tried to report the incident to the U.S. attorney's
office, as well as the FBI, but both Justice Department entities declined
to take their report. The same proved to be true at the county level with
Sheriff Jerry Keller.
"I know that if I would have assaulted the IRS agent, I would be sitting in
jail right now," Nicholson said. "But because the IRS agent is the one who
assaulted me, Metro [Las Vegas Police] only took a statement and let him
Hidden Ball Trick
When the Metro police came out, Nicholson gave a voluntary statement backed
up by his witnesses and the tape recording. He was told that he would have
to wait five days before the report would be actually recorded in the
police records.
"On the sixth day, I went in and found out that no police report had been
made at all. When I demanded that the report be filed and made official, I
was told that I had a statute of limitations of five days to ask and demand
prosecution from the date of the incident and that now I was too late."
In other words, Nicholson was hoodwinked by officialdom. A spokesman for
the Las Vegas Police Department said that investigators informed Nicholson
he had to contact the department within five days of the incident if he
wanted to initiate action against Davis, since it was "just a misdemeanor
battery." LVMPD officials are sticking to their story that Nicholson had
not contacted the department seeking action against Davis.
The spokesman also said the department gave all of the information to the
IRS Criminal Investigation Division. No announcement has been forthcoming
as to whether Davis has been terminated, placed on leave pending an
investigation, or is being held for psychiatric observation.
"If Nicholson wants prosecution, he can contact the general investigations
division within the department and they can move forward on it," the
unnamed spokesman added. However, the frustrations of not seeing any
justice in the criminal courts have motivated Nicholson toward a civil

The Oct. 2 incident occurred when Wiley Davis, an IRS Team Manager from
Colorado, became agitated with Las Vegas resident Ken Nicholson, 37, during
a hearing to discuss an IRS lien against some property owned by Nicholson's
friend, Keith Milbourn. Davis, 45, had been brought in from Denver
specifically for the Milbourn case.
The Las Vegas Tribune first reported the altercation as arising from a tax
dispute involving an IRS lien against some property belonging to Ken
Nicholson. This was inaccurate. Nicholson had gone along as counsel for his
friends, Keith and Shawna Milbourn, and as a witness to the proceedings. It
was Milbourn's case that was in dispute. They had also taken along court
reporter Beatrice Conner, who caught the whole incident on audiotape.
Nicholson had Power of Attorney to speak for Milbourn, 32. Davis was
assisted by a female agent. Throughout the hearing, the two men made it
clear that they were not going to take Davis' word for anything and would
need actual documentation to prove the IRS' stand. Finally, Nicholson said
that they would be willing to pay whatever the IRS claimed Milbourn owed if
Davis could:
1) Produce a Notice and Demand for the tax; and
2) Give a Code Section which made Milbourn liable.
Nicholson said, and witnesses as well as the tape recording concur, that
Davis did not attempt to produce that evidence but instead became visibly
angry, lost his self-control and attacked Nicholson.
Offense is the Best Defense
"Out of nowhere," said Nicholson, "he jumped up out of his chair and came
around the table, grabbed my chair, and began bouncing it up and down. He
shoved it forward and pushed me toward the table. [In the process,] my legs
came apart and were straddling the arm of the chair. With three or four
quick jerks, he yanked the arm of the chair upward and into my groin. Then
he grabbed me and began to physically evict me from the room."
Security officers came in and stopped the melee at the Oakley Boulevard
office of the IRS in Las Vegas.
Court stenographer Beatrice Conner was shocked speechless when Nicholson
was knocked to the floor. "It was totally without provocation," she said.
"He (Davis) was so angry and violent that if he had had a gun, he would
have pulled it out!"
Keith Milbourn, who witnessed the whole meeting and scuffle, gave more
"By the time we called the police there were about ten people in the
hallway including other agents, the witnesses and security guards,"
Milbourn told us, adding that the other IRS agent who was in the room,
Renee Swells, was "surprised and shocked" by Davis' action. Swells was
unavailable for comment.
Milbourn and Nicholson had called 911 "and the cops arrived in five minutes
all gung-ho and ready to arrest Ken. However, when they heard the tape
played back, they all fell silent, not knowing what to do."
So the officers did nothing. No arrest was made.
Both men said they tried to report the incident to the U.S. attorney's
office, as well as the FBI, but both Justice Department entities declined
to take their report. The same proved to be true at the county level with
Sheriff Jerry Keller.
"I know that if I would have assaulted the IRS agent, I would be sitting in
jail right now," Nicholson said. "But because the IRS agent is the one who
assaulted me, Metro [Las Vegas Police] only took a statement and let him
Hidden Ball Trick
When the Metro police came out, Nicholson gave a voluntary statement backed
up by his witnesses and the tape recording. He was told that he would have
to wait five days before the report would be actually recorded in the
police records.
"On the sixth day, I went in and found out that no police report had been
made at all. When I demanded that the report be filed and made official, I
was told that I had a statute of limitations of five days to ask and demand
prosecution from the date of the incident and that now I was too late."
In other words, Nicholson was hoodwinked by officialdom. A spokesman for
the Las Vegas Police Department said that investigators informed Nicholson
he had to contact the department within five days of the incident if he
wanted to initiate action against Davis, since it was "just a misdemeanor
battery." LVMPD officials are sticking to their story that Nicholson had
not contacted the department seeking action against Davis.
The spokesman also said the department gave all of the information to the
IRS Criminal Investigation Division. No announcement has been forthcoming
as to whether Davis has been terminated, placed on leave pending an
investigation, or is being held for psychiatric observation.
"If Nicholson wants prosecution, he can contact the general investigations
division within the department and they can move forward on it," the
unnamed spokesman added. However, the frustrations of not seeing any
justice in the criminal courts have motivated Nicholson toward a civil

@_subject: Licenced to Program? 
Enough already! Ban programming.
@ Articles     Dec 16 2001 - 02:54 EST   No I don't agree with or endorse in any way this statement, but to anyone
who would like an insight into the minds (often closed minds) of the
general public who have been manipulated by the mass media into almost
decleration of war on Hackers and other such sub-cultures of hacking. This article is from Adequacy.org and as such copyright and the rest of
it. Programming computers is, for practically everyone, something done far
away in exotic software engineering facilities by a priesthood of
ultra-specialized, half-mad obsessive-compulsives. This is as it should
be, and it is where we get the software we use every day to do our online
banking, send email, and get productive work done. Though few normal
people have any experience of it, or know anyone who does it, there is
another kind of programming performed outside this legitimate sphere, one
that you probably assumed was illegal, but shockingly, is not. This other kind of programming also affects us every day, but negatively,
as a continuous series of massive disruptions to the worldwide economy in
the form of viruses, in the form of important and useful computer services
being sabotaged with denial-of-service, in the form of defacement attacks,
and in the form of substantially higher prices for all sorts of
intellectual property such as software, DVD movies and music on CD, all
due to piracy. I'm talking about "hacking" of course. It is the evil dark
side to all the good that computers have brought us, and we are all sick
of it. The time has come to put a stop to "hacking", because we can no
longer tolerate the damage "hackers" cause, and the potential risk of
terrorism when, not if, "hackers" go to work for such forces of mayhem as
have begun an onslaught of terror against not just the United States, but
Western Civilization's freedom to be loose and decadent in general. For a time, our society tolerated "hackers" because they promised that
something useful would come of their shady and secretive tinkering. Yet we
have had nothing but a harvest of bitter fruit from "hackers", and it is
now time to pull the plug. It is time to ban all unlicensed computer
programming, and take steps to ensure that no one outside of government,
select universities, and state-sanctioned private-sector corporate
software engineering facilities is given the knowledge, skills, or means
to write or compile computer code of any kind. Amateur or hobbyist
computer programming has grown from a minor annoyance to a major social
disease, and it simply can no longer be tolerated. Although ordinary decent people will find this suggestion to be obvious to
the point of banality -- in fact, I'm sure many of you are surprised that
amateur computer programming was ever legal! -- many of those who
associate themselves with the "hacker community" will bridle at the
suggestion. Strictly as an exercise, it would perhaps be diverting to
entertain some of their more obvious objections. The first cry in defense of hobbyists toying with this dangerous
technology is that hackers have already proven their worth by producing a
valuable piece of software -- namely, the Apache web server. Others would
even claim that more than one useful program has been written in the
garages and and lonely bedrooms of hobbyists. There are two delusions at
work here. One of these delusions is that any of the Open Source applications that
have found some utility in business and industry were written by amateurs.
The truth is that Apache began it's life as the work of professional
coders employed by Amazon.com, and as any software engineer you want to
ask can tell you, nothing of value was added by anyone but professionals.
In truth, the work of the gainfully employed programmers on this project
was often interrupted and even sabotaged by the ham-fisted meddling of the
teenage wanna-be's and self-styled "gurus" who have accumulated around
professional Open Source projects like so many leeches and barnacles. This
episode alone demonstrates that if there is anything good to come out of
Open Source methodology, it will only be helped along by the removal of
dilettantes from the picture. Indeed, once the "hackers" have been
outlawed, Open Source will very likely reach new heights of utility and
quality, and perhaps even fulfill the promise of greatness that Open
Source advocates have been making for years. The other delusion, or I should say piece of misinformation, that has been
perpetrated by "hackers" is that there are many other "tools" that have
been created by hackers and gifted to a grateful world by our benevolent
hobbyists. What about Emacs, for example? What about it? Emacs was
originally created at MIT, a trusted part of the US military research
establishment. Obviously, such facilities and their (suitably cleared)
employees will never be banned. The time has come to ban the reckless
tourists from the programming field, not legitimate university
researchers. It is true that Emacs, and similar tools have subsequently
been "enhanced" by "hackers". Generally, we have seen a pattern of
mind-boggling feature creep and software bloat as a result of this. Emacs,
for all its admirers, is the worst known example of this. In addition, all
of the "functionality" that has been added to Emacs, or other "tools"
touted by free software hackers such as Flex, Bison, gcc, etc. are
hacker's tools. That means that they are like lock picks or zip guns. They
have no inherent functionality that is not ultimately malevolent and
illegal in its purpose. This is not utility or service. This is
disservice. The reason that hobbyists work so feverishly hard on creating this kind of
tool is precisely because they are locked out of the world of the normal,
decent software engineer, where professional-grade IDEs, debuggers, and
similar tools are abundant. Those with ultimately criminal intent must
cobble together their own weapons. There are dozens, even hundreds of
these types of destructive programs in circulation, such as those
mentioned, as well as the notorious "Back Orifice", or the hacker
operating system, "Lunix". While a "hacker" could disingenuously and
spuriously argue that each one of these various illegal programs has some
redeeming social value, it is clear that taken as a whole, such "warez" do
not in fact benefit anyone except "hackers" and other criminals. Rather than waste any more time tediously demonstrating this fact for each
of these "hacker's" tools, it would be best to move on to the other canard
that "hackers" raise in defense of their "freedom" to "hack". And that
would be freedom itself. Is there a right to "hack"? Well, of course there
most certainly is not. Is there a right to build atomic bombs or breed
anthrax bacilli in one's back yard? Is there a right to spy on your
government and pass on that information to our foreign enemies, merely
because you have chosen espionage as a "hobby"? Perhaps you could claim
that your interest in espionage is driven by an innate curiosity, a desire
to discover new things and understand how the world works. And so what?
Such apologetics are amusing coming from children, but to hear an adult
make such excuses is not funny at all. It is merely sad. Few precocious adolescent "hackers" are capable of understanding why
responsible nations must ban "hacking", but as adults we can all recognize
that these apologetics for hobbyist "hacking" carry no weight at all, and
so we must do what is right. If you style yourself a "hacker" and you
really want to play around with dangerous toys, be it source code,
fissionable material, or biotoxins, then you have only one route open to
you: go to college and prove that you really have the mental horsepower to
cut the mustard, and prove also that you are a loyal patriot who can be
trusted with potentially deadly power. Then, and only then, will a decent
society trust you with the secrets of our most awesome technology. Those
too impatient to wait, too dull to get into a university, and too flaky to
get security clearance due to low character, drug abuse, and trafficking
with unsavory characters are simply out of luck. And it's a good thing
too. Is it practical to ban "hacking" now? Absolutely. There is no better time than now. As we have seen by the
recent mass murders by terrorists, computer technology is a mainstay of
criminals, and they rely most on such "free" tools as text editors and
military-grade encryption programs that "hackers" use simply because they
think it is cute to play with such power. But the rest of society has lost
patience with this childish diddling, and the civilized world has said
unequivocally that we want strong legal safeguards enacted to put an end
to "hacking" and terrorism. We most especially have no qualms about
banning activities like playing with explosives or creating software when
these so-called "hobbies" are restricted to a tiny fringe element who for
whatever reason gets no pleasure from healthy pastimes like fly fishing or
drinking alcohol at gentlemen's clubs. Put simply, normal folks are not going to let themselves get blown up
because a tiny minority of freaks like to "hack". If you aren't willing to
code for Uncle Sam, then don't code at all. Author's note: Since it is likely that many so-called g**ks or "hackers"
will read this article and will perhaps become angry about it, and then,
typically, lose control of their anger, I want to this opportunity to ask
them to please refrain from attacking Adequacy.org in retaliation. Though
you might disagree with an opinion that you read, that is no reason to
launch a denial of service attack against the medium. Please use your
reason and, if you feel strongly, engage in a polite dialogue, rather than
acting out your anger with illegal "hacking" attacks. Thank you for not
attacking this web site.

Reply-To: ParanoidTimes at yahoogroups.com
U.S. Out of Line on Global Positioning, EU Says
Barry James
International Herald Tribune
Wednesday, December 19, 2001
PARIS - The European Commission said Tuesday that the
United States had sought to block the deployment of a
European system of navigation known as Galileo, with
the Americans arguing that an enemy could turn it
against the West in the event of a war.
The U.S. move added to the economic and political
pressures surrounding the project in Europe, where
many countries see it as a vital means of catching up
with America in a key technology sector but others
balk at the expense.
Only last weekend, at a summit meeting in Brussels,
leaders of the European Union instructed government
ministers to try to resolve the financing issues by
A spokesman for the commission said the U.S. Defense
Department had written to the defense ministers of the
15 EU countries warning that Galileo could be used by
an enemy and asking governments to consider scrapping
the project.
But President Jacques Chirac of France warned that
Europeans risked "vassal status" if they abandoned
this and other important space projects.
France and several other governments, as well as the
European Commission, see Galileo as a vital
counterweight to the U.S. Global Positioning System,
which has a vast number of military and civilian
applications, from landing smart weapons on target to
locating trucks on a continental highway network.
The United States offers free use of the Global
Positioning System to the EU countries, but the
commission spokesman, Gilles Gantelet, said there was
no guarantee that it would still be free in 10 years'
Loyola de Palacio, the European commissioner in charge
of the Galileo project, angrily denounced the
prospects of further delays. "We are at the limits of
coherence already," she said, "and any new delay
threatens the profitability of the project."
While the United States had originally expressed its
support for the European project, Mrs. Palacio said
there was now "a letter and pressure exerted by the
United States. American pressure against the Galileo
project has increased since September 11."
The commission says the project must be operational by
2008 to be profitable. This is partly because the
World Telecommunication Union has guaranteed radio
frequencies only up to that date, and partly because
the EU has entered into commitments with a number of
other countries, including the United States, Canada,
Russia and China.
Under the worst possible scenario, including the need
for backup launchers and satellites, the final bill to
deploy Galileo could be as high as E3.6 billion ($3.2
billion), according to an independent accounting survey
carried out on behalf of the commission this year.
But the accounting study also estimated that Galileo
would generate economic benefits more than four times
greater than that, with wide scale applications in
transport and personal communications, and a vital
contribution to the operations of police, fire and
emergency services. The study indicated substantial
social and economic benefits, "notably for the
protection of the environment, employment and European
technological development."
Mr. Gantelet said the U.S. objections were contained
in a letter dated Dec. 4 from the deputy secretary of
defense, Paul Wolfowitz. He said the Americans
considered, "in times of conflict, they would have
problems because of Galileo. They feel that the enemy
could use some applications of Galileo and that they
could not impede that."
According to diplomatic sources who have seen the
letter, Mr. Wolfowitz said the United States was
planning to upgrade its Global Positioning System by
separating the military and civilian spectra.
The addition of Galileo services in the same spectra,
the letter said, "will significantly complicate our
ability to ensure availability of critical GPS
services in times of crisis or conflict and at the
same time assure that adversary forces are denied
similar capabilities."
He said the U.S. government was willing to work toward
finding acceptable solutions to "avert potentially
serious impacts."
The apparent U.S. bid to block Galileo is likely to
have the most resonance precisely in the countries
most skeptical about the project: Britain, the
Netherlands and Germany. They argue in essence that it
is pointless to spend so much money on something they
can get for free from the United States.
Because of their objections, EU transport ministers
refused on Dec. 7 to release money to fund the next
phase of the project.
In a speech to the National Center for Space Studies
in Paris, Mr. Chirac said that satellite navigation
had vital commercial and industrial applications and
would be a key factor in the European Union's ambition
to build up an independent security capability, with
the planned creation of a rapid reaction military force.
Mr. Chirac said the United States spent six times more
on space ventures than the European Union. Not to
react to U.S. space conquests, he said "would lead our
country inevitably to a vassal status, first scientific
and technical and then industrial and economic."

The discovery of a major spy ring inside the United States is straining the already tense relations with Israel. Although, Israel denied any involvement with the penetration of the U.S. wiretap system, the CIA and FBI are investigating the direct government ties to the former Israeli military and intelligence officials now being held by the Justice Department.
One major drug bust operation planned by the Los Angeles police was foiled by what now appear to be reverse wiretaps placed on law enforcement phones by the criminal spy ring.

The crime of distributed computing
By Ann Harrison
Posted: 20/12/2001 at 17:33 GMT
A college computer technician who offered his school's unused computer
processing power for an encryption research project will be tried next
month in Georgia for computer theft and trespassing charges that carry a
potential total of 120 years in jail. The closely-watched case if one of the first in which state prosecutors
have lodged felony charges for allegedly downloading third-party software
without permission. David McOwen was working as a PC specialist at the state-run DeKalb
Technical Institute in 1998, when he learned about a project by the
non-profit organization distributed.net that allowed computer users to
donate their unused processing power to test the RC5 encryption algorithm.
Noticing that many of the machines he maintained on the seven DeKalb
campuses sat idle for long periods, McOwen installed distributed.net
clients at several of those locations while performing a Y2K upgrade on
the machines in 1999. According to McOwen, during the Christmas holidays in 1999 school
administrators noticed that unused machines were sending and receiving the
distributed.net data -- about the equivalent of one email a day. The
school sent McOwen a letter of suspension in January of 2000, without
specifying a grievance, and McOwen resigned shortly afterwards, believing
that he had put the incident behind him. Instead, in June of 2001 McOwen was contacted by an investigator from the
Georgia Bureau of Investigation who informed him that he was the subject
of an 18-month computer crime investigation. In October, prosecutors from
the Georgia state attorney general's office charged McOwen with eight
violations of Georgia's tough computer crime law: one count of computer
theft, and seven counts of computer trespass -- one for each of the school
offices where McOwen downloaded the distributed.net client. Each felony count carries a $50,000 fine and a 15-year possible prison
term, for a 120 year maximum possible sentence. The indictment also calls
for restitution equal to the amount of money paid to state workers to
uninstall the programs from 500 PCs. As the case nears trial, it's raising eyebrows among some legal and
technology experts for the unusual application of an anti-hacking law to
actions taken by a network's legitimate administrator. 'This Is Not Hacking' "Our problem with this kind of statute is that it is written in such broad
terms that it can reach all sorts of behavior that doesn't constitute
computer fraud, but can give the government prosecutorial discretion,"
says Lee Tien, a senior staff attorney with the San Francisco-based
Electronic Frontier Foundation, who has followed McOwen's case. "This is a hacking statute," says McOwen, "but obviously this is not
hacking." At an early stage in the proceedings, prosecutors claimed that
McOwen had cost the state of Georgia $415,000 in bandwidth charges, based
on a calculation that the distributed.net clients consumed precisely 59
cents worth of bandwidth per second. The state has since backed away from
the $415,000 figure. Today, much of the case rests on whether McOwen violated DeKalb's policies
by downloading the distributed.net client. Russ Willard, a spokesman for
Georgia Attorney General Thurbert Baker, contends that McOwen deliberately
ignored the college's written computer usage guidelines, which were issued
to him with his first user I.D. and password. Willard says the policy
forbade McOwen from downloading any unauthorized third-party software onto
the college's machines. McOwen claims he had permission from college officials to download the
software, and his lawyer suggests that there were no written guidelines
forbidding such installations to begin with. "If there is a policy I have
not seen it," says attorney David Joyner, who says he has received all the
discovery evidence in the case. DeKalb college president Paul Starnes and
McOwen's supervisors from the college's IS department would not comment on
the case. Even if there was such a policy presented to McOwen, those who work at
universities say they are often disregarded. "It think it's so common on
the academic community that nobody reads agreements like that," says David
Farber, a professor of telecommunications at the University of
Pennsylvania and former chief technologist of the FCC. "It is part and
parcel of many academics and many students that inquisitiveness motivates
them to download third-party software. If you are going to prosecute a
person for that on those grounds, than you should prosecute everybody on
campus because everyone has done it." Financial Motive Alleged Willard says that McOwen was singled out for prosecution partly because he
had ignored his supervisor's warnings. "In this case, Mr. McOwen was
expressively prohibited by his superiors from downloading these programs
and was informed on many occasions by his supervisors to stop downloading
programs," said Willard. "They were aware that he was doing it and he had
gone in and cleaned it up on numerous occasions." Joyner insists McOwen
received no such warning. Prosecutors also claim that McOwen had a financial motive for volunteering
the school's machines. McOwen was a top producer on distributed.net for
"Team AnandTech," a group sponsored by a hardware forum site which is
still the second ranking contributor to the RC5 research project. A $1,000
prize goes to the individual contributor who recovers the RC5 encryption
key. "McOwen placed a program on computers, that in his estimation would
benefit him personally, including computers that has sensitive student
financial and identity information without authorization," says Willard.
"There is concern about the program itself compromising or providing the
basis to compromise sensitive personal or financial information, there is
the matter of Mr. McOwen's unauthorized activities on this computer, and
finally there is the point that there was misappropriation of state
property." McOwen says the prize money wasn't a factor. "People do these projects for
the betterment of mankind," says McOwen. "You are not doing it for the
prize and possibility of money, you are doing it because it is the right
thing to do." "I think the prosecutor's office needs some lessons in computer science,"
says Farber. "If you want to make a point, there are much better examples
than this guy." The case is set for trial on 28 January. Â© 2001 SecurityFocus.com, all rights reserved.

Applied Digital pushes microchip to plant in foreigners for tracking
By Deborah Circelli, Palm Beach Post Staff Writer
   PALM BEACH -- Today's security measures don't work very well, says
Richard Sullivan, pointing to the Sept. 11 terror attacks on New York and
   He's says he's got a better idea: a microchip instead of a green card.
Foreigners who pass through customs or immigration could be injected with
the chip, allowing officials to monitor their activities better and keep
terrorists out.
   "Man today is more than ever converging with technology," said
Sullivan, who is CEO of the Palm Beach-based tech company Applied Digital
Solutions (Nasdaq: ADSX, 45 cents). "I think the positives overwhelmingly
overcome any small negatives. The government is more prepared, for the
overall benefit of our citizens, to advocate some of these changes."
   Sullivan's company has high hopes for the implantable technology, which
it unveiled Wednesday. Until now, the microchips -- called VeriChips --
have been used for tracking and identifying animals.
   Applied Digital has had a patent for such devices since 1999. The new
technology would make Applied Digital the first company in the nation to
sell microchips designed to be implanted in human beings.
   But privacy groups reacted with outrage Wednesday to Sullivan's idea
for monitoring foreigners. America is not that desperate, one group said,
citing a violation of "bodily integrity."
   "That is so unconstitutional," said Randall Marshall, legal director
for the Miami chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. "I can't
imagine this surviving a constitutional challenge. It just simply goes way
too far outside the realm of what we believe in as a society."
   Sullivan said the product will be marketed in January in South America
while the company seeks approval in the United States from the Food and
Drug Administration. Approval is expected in 18 months.
   A New Jersey surgeon who serves on the board of Owings, Md.-based
Medical Advisory Systems, which is about to combine with a subsidiary of
Applied Digital, injected himself with two of the VeriChips five days
after the terror attacks.
   Richard Seelig inserted the chips in his forearm and hip as part of the
clinical process Applied Digital will have to conduct to receive FDA
approval, Sullivan said. Seelig, 55, referred all questions Wednesday to
Sullivan but told the Los Angeles Times he felt compelled to have a secure
form of identification after Sept. 11.
   "I was so compelled by what had happened," Seelig told the Times. "One
of the potential applications suddenly jumped out -- the ability to have a
secure form of identification -- and I felt I had to take the next step."
   The chips are about the size of a grain of rice and contain an
identification number or other data, such as medical information, and a
person's address and phone number.
   The chips have no internal power source. Their data can't be read
without a scanner close at hand. The next generation of body chips -- one
that transmits signals from a distance -- is several years away.
   The chip is the same as the one Applied Digital's subsidiary uses in
more than 1 million animals, but the VeriChip can be used in humans with a
pacemaker, artificial heart valves or orthopedic knee devices. If a
patient needs help, a hospital can use a scanner to obtain information.
   In five years, Sullivan said he can see the chips being used in
children, the elderly, prisoners, and by employers at facilities such as
airports and nuclear plants. Society in general could use them instead of
ATM or credit cards, he said.
   But Evan Hendricks, editor and publisher of Privacy Times, a
Washington, D.C.-based newsletter, said it's one thing for an individual
to choose to implant the device for medical purposes, but it's crossing
the line when parents start putting them in their children or employers
require them for employment.
   "This has been science fiction for most of our adult life, but now we
see the technology allows it," Hendricks said. "The problem is that it is
happening in a vacuum where there are not adequate privacy laws."

Russian Adobe Hacker Busted

   LAS VEGAS -- FBI agents have arrested a Russian programmer for giving

   Dmitry Sklyarov, a lead programmer for Russian software company
   ElcomSoft, was visiting the United States for the annual Defcon hacker

   e-books.
   This would be the second known prosecution under the criminal sections

RIAA Wants Background Checks on CD-RW Buyers
Washington DC - The RIAA is lobbying for vendors of CD-RW drives to
conduct background checks and require a 3 day waiting period before the
drive can be sold.
The extensive background check would include cross referencing credit card
numbers with local merchants sales logs looking for purchases of
dual-cassette decks between the years of 1980 and 1987. It would also
include checking for installation of file sharing software, knowledge of
the Internet, and the ability to hum. Any of which would bar the purchaser
from receiving his drive.
Saaaatan? "A CD-RW can be a dangerous weapon when it falls into the wrong
hands," said RIAA President Hilary Rosen, "You wouldn't sell a gun to a
convicted felon and you shouldn't sell a CD-RW drive to a Gnutella user.
The 3 day waiting period gives us time to verify that no copyrighted
material is on the purchasers hard drive and to make sure they have a
membership in the Columbia House CD club."
Current owners of CD-RW drives would be required to obtain a license for
use of the drive or face stiff fines. Licenses could be obtained by
enrollment at a local RIAA Education Camp where the horrors of copyright
violation would be instilled with the use of electro-shock therapy.
"I was alarmed when I heard that children had the ability to burn CDs
right on their computers," said Senator Strom Thurmond, "We've tried to
educate parents on the dangers of children playing with fire, and now
these death merchants sell them that ability in a shiny metal box." Other
Senators voiced their concerns about the possible violations of privacy in
the proposed legislation, but since it was called the Copyright Patriotism
Act they are unable to oppose it.
"The RIAA has gone too far this time. There are uses for CD-RW drives that
don't violate RIAA copyrights like burning multiple copies of Microsoft
Office for friends and neighbors," said Matthew Sodor an opponent of the
legislation. Other News:

You don't feel outraged if it applies ONLY to non-americans?
How would you people feel if we took the same liberty
to try and execute suspected American terrorists and
hold secret tribunals for them?
It is just a question of perspective - one man's freedom fighter
is another man's terrorist, like the Taleban have learned. The
victor writes the history - and can re-write it again, like the
Americans have proved to the Taleban.
Why can't countries respect each other's citizens' rights? Or
more specifically, why is it that America has such a big problem
understanding that perhaps the non-Americans consider themselves
worthy of the same basic human rights? Is that arrogant of (us)
non-Americans? It is *this* very attitude which is birthing the
"hate" towards the US, that very "hate" which americans find so
hard to understand, and account it to envy and jealousy.
If you can't afford to give other people/nations the respect
they deserve, you shouldn't expect to get any in return.

For Immediate Release
Office of the Press Secretary
November 13, 2001 Military Order Detention, Treatment, and Trial of Certain Non-Citizens in the War Against Terrorism By the authority vested in me as President and as Commander in Chief of
the Armed Forces of the United States by the Constitution and the laws of
the United States of America, including the Authorization for Use of
Military Force Joint Resolution (Public Law 107-40, 115 Stat. 224) and
sections 821 and 836 of title 10, United States Code, it is hereby ordered
as follows:
Section 1.  Findings.
(a)  International terrorists, including members of al Qaida, have carried
out attacks on United States diplomatic and military personnel and
facilities abroad and on citizens and property within the United States on
a scale that has created a state of armed conflict that requires the use
of the United States Armed Forces.
(b)  In light of grave acts of terrorism and threats of terrorism,
including the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, on the headquarters
of the United States Department of Defense in the national capital region,
on the World Trade Center in New York, and on civilian aircraft such as in
Pennsylvania, I proclaimed a national emergency on September 14, 2001
(Proc. 7463, Declaration of National Emergency by Reason of Certain
Terrorist Attacks).
(c)  Individuals acting alone and in concert involved in international
terrorism possess both the capability and the intention to undertake
further terrorist attacks against the United States that, if not detected
and prevented, will cause mass deaths, mass injuries, and massive
destruction of property, and may place at risk the continuity of the
operations of the United States Government.
(d)  The ability of the United States to protect the United States and its
citizens, and to help its allies and other cooperating nations protect
their nations and their citizens, from such further terrorist attacks
depends in significant part upon using the United States Armed Forces to
identify terrorists and those who support them, to disrupt their
activities, and to eliminate their ability to conduct or support such
(e)  To protect the United States and its citizens, and for the effective
conduct of military operations and prevention of terrorist attacks, it is
necessary for individuals subject to this order pursuant to section 2
hereof to be detained, and, when tried, to be tried for violations of the
laws of war and other applicable laws by military tribunals.
(f)  Given the danger to the safety of the United States and the nature of
international terrorism, and to the extent provided by and under this
order, I find consistent with section 836 of title 10, United States Code,
that it is not practicable to apply in military commissions under this
order the principles of law and the rules of evidence generally recognized
in the trial of criminal cases in the United States district courts.
(g)  Having fully considered the magnitude of the potential deaths,
injuries, and property destruction that would result from potential acts
of terrorism against the United States, and the probability that such acts
will occur, I have determined that an extraordinary emergency exists for
national defense purposes, that this emergency constitutes an urgent and
compelling government interest, and that issuance of this order is
necessary to meet the emergency.
Sec. 2.  Definition and Policy.
(a)  The term "individual subject to this order" shall mean any individual
who is not a United States citizen with respect to whom I determine from
time to time in writing that:
  (1)  there is reason to believe that such individual, at the relevant times,
    (i) is or was a member of the organization known as al Qaida;     (ii) has engaged in, aided or abetted, or conspired to commit, acts of
international terrorism, or acts in preparation therefor, that have
caused, threaten to cause, or have as their aim to cause, injury to or
adverse effects on the United States, its citizens, national security,
foreign policy, or economy; or
    (iii) has knowingly harbored one or more individuals described in
subparagraphs (i) or (ii) of subsection 2(a)(1) of this order; and
  (2)  it is in the interest of the United States that such individual be
subject to this order.
(b)  It is the policy of the United States that the Secretary of Defense
shall take all necessary measures to ensure that any individual subject to
this order is detained in accordance with section 3, and, if the
individual is to be tried, that such individual is tried only in
accordance with section 4.
(c)  It is further the policy of the United States that any individual
subject to this order who is not already under the control of the
Secretary of Defense but who is under the control of any other officer or
agent of the United States or any State shall, upon delivery of a copy of
such written determination to such officer or agent, forthwith be placed
under the control of the Secretary of Defense.
Sec. 3.  Detention Authority of the Secretary of Defense. Any individual subject to this order shall be -- (a)  detained at an appropriate location designated by the Secretary of
Defense outside or within the United States;
(b)  treated humanely, without any adverse distinction based on race,
color, religion, gender, birth, wealth, or any similar criteria;
(c)  afforded adequate food, drinking water, shelter, clothing, and
medical treatment;
(d)  allowed the free exercise of religion consistent with the
requirements of such detention; and
(e)  detained in accordance with such other conditions as the Secretary of
Defense may prescribe.

military commission for any and all offenses triable by military
commission that such individual is alleged to have committed, and may be
punished in accordance with the penalties provided under applicable law,
including life imprisonment or death.
(b)  As a military function and in light of the findings in section 1,
including subsection (f) thereof, the Secretary of Defense shall issue
such orders and regulations, including orders for the appointment of one
or more military commissions, as may be necessary to carry out subsection
(a) of this section.
(c)  Orders and regulations issued under subsection (b) of this section
shall include, but not be limited to, rules for the conduct of the
proceedings of military commissions, including pretrial, trial, and
post-trial procedures, modes of proof, issuance of process, and
qualifications of attorneys, which shall at a minimum provide for --
  (1)  military commissions to sit at any time and any place, consistent
with such guidance regarding time and place as the Secretary of Defense
may provide;
  (2)  a full and fair trial, with the military commission sitting as the
triers of both fact and law;
  (3)  admission of such evidence as would, in the opinion of the
presiding officer of the military commission (or instead, if any other
member of the commission so requests at the time the presiding officer
renders that opinion, the opinion of the commission rendered at that time
by a majority of the commission), have probative value to a reasonable
  (4)  in a manner consistent with the protection of information
classified or classifiable under Executive Order 12958 of April 17, 1995,
as amended, or any successor Executive Order, protected by statute or rule
from unauthorized disclosure, or otherwise protected by law, (A) the
handling of, admission into evidence of, and access to materials and
information, and (B) the conduct, closure of, and access to proceedings;
  (5)  conduct of the prosecution by one or more attorneys designated by
the Secretary of Defense and conduct of the defense by attorneys for the
individual subject to this order;
  (6)  conviction only upon the concurrence of two-thirds of the members
of the commission present at the time of the vote, a majority being

present; and
  (8)  submission of the record of the trial, including any conviction or
sentence, for review and final decision by me or by the Secretary of
Defense if so designated by me for that purpose.
Sec. 5.  Obligation of Other Agencies to Assist the Secretary of Defense.
Departments, agencies, entities, and officers of the United States shall,
to the maximum extent permitted by law, provide to the Secretary of
Defense such assistance as he may request to implement this order.
Sec. 6.  Additional Authorities of the Secretary of Defense.

Reply-To: Law & Policy of Computer Communications Article III extends the judicial power to cases arising under the
Constitution, laws of the United States, etc. Article I authorizes Congress
to define and punish offenses against the law of nations, something
apparently apart from the laws of the United States. The real issue is not
an Article III tribunal vs an Article I tribunal, but whether you get the
little niceties like a public trial, a jury, and a lawyer. In other words,
it's not about whether the military tribunal has jurisdiction, but whether
the "defendant" has constitutional rights in either forum.
Wong Wing v. U.S., 163 US 228 (1896) holds that resident aliens are
entitled to the protection of the 5th and 6th Amendment (due process, jury
trial) if they are to be charged and imprisoned instead of deported. U.S.
v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 US 1092 (1990) distinguishes Wong Wing in holding
the 4th Amendment does not apply to searches outside of the United States
where the alien has "no significant voluntary connection" to the U.S. In
that case the defendant was grabbed and his house searched in Mexico before
he was whisked into the U.S. for trial, where his 4th Amendment claims were
rejected because the Bill of Rights doesn't protect non-resident aliens. It
is likely that the rationale of Verdugo-Urquidez supports the
constitutionality of the executive order as applied to alleged terrorists
captured in Afghanistan, and either tried there or like Verdugo-Rodriguez
brought here involuntarily. Non-resident aliens are simply unprotected by
the Bill of Rights.
With respect to those captured in the U.S., Ex parte Quirin, 317 U.S. 1
(1942) indicates that "unlawful belligerents" accused of violations of the
"laws of war" are not entitled to jury trials because violations of the
laws of war were not among the crimes triable by jury at common law (like
claims in equity). The problem is the uncertain scope of the terms "laws of
war" and "unlawful belligerents" -- Quirin seems to be define each only by
reference to the other, and the terms seem even less exact today than they
did in 1942. Quirin characterizes as unlawful belligerents (in contrast
with lawful belligerents who must be treated as POWs) those "secretly
passing through the defenses of the United States in civilian dress, for
purpose of committing hostile acts." In the context of the current "war on
terrorism," the terrorists found in the U.S. likely qualify as unlawful
belligerents if they are here to commit "hostile acts." It seems to me that
"hostile acts" might include money laundering, drug smuggling, even credit
card fraud. It's not even clear that the "hostile acts" have to be
otherwise criminal acts, but it is clear from Quirin that ordinary crimes,
like conspiracy to blow up a building, can be re-cast as violations of the
law of war when perpetrated by "unlawful belligerents." Moreover, Quirin
indicates that even U.S. citizenship does not entitle an unlawful
belligerent to a jury trial. Quirin claimed to have been a citizen since he
was 4 years old, an issue that the Court found unnecessary to address.
The problem with this is that in Quirin the court looked to a real
honest-to-god declaration of war as the source of the President's authority
to send the German spies to a military tribunal. This time, we're looking
at a joint resolution authorizing the President to use necessary and
appropriate force to end terrorism, which is undefined. The foreign
belligerent is not a foreign nation, but a network that is not altogether
foreign. It raises a question as to whether there is a distinction between
a war on terrorism, and, for example, a war on drug trafficking; or whether
terrorism might be defined to include drug trafficking, or almost any other
anti-social behavior that we want to deal with free of all the nasty
complications caused by lawyers and juries. How hard would it be to define
people who blow up abortion clinics, or set free lab animals, or write
computer viruses, or (you'll like this, Andrew) distribute DeCSS, as among
the enemies in the war against terrorism.

@_subject: Gross Usurpation of Power 
Gross Usurpation of Power
by David Dieteman
The Constitution of the United States is a law for rulers and people, equally in war and in peace, and covers with the shield of its protection all classes of men, at all times, and under all circumstances. No doctrine, involving more pernicious consequences, was ever invented by the wit of man than that any of its provisions can be suspended during any of the great exigencies of government.
~ Ex parte Milligan, 71 U.S. 2 (1866)
A great many conservatives have uncritically accepted the expansion of government powers in the wake of the terrible events of September 11. They have acquiesced in the creation of the Bureau of Homeland Security, an entity which would have made the Founding Fathers cringe, if not revolt (they revolted against much less).
One hopes that such alleged conservatives, who profess to value limited government, the rule of law, and liberty, will be disturbed by one of President Bush's recent actions.
On November 13, President Bush signed an order allowing military trials of terrorism suspects, rather than civil courts. As the Washington Post reports,
The presidential directive, signed by Bush as commander in chief, applies to non-U.S. citizens arrested in the United States or abroad. The president himself will decide which defendants will be tried by military tribunals. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld will appoint each panel and set its rules and procedures, including the level of proof needed for a conviction. There will be no judicial review.
The only review will be by the U.S. President and the Secretary of Defense. No American court, and no international tribunal, will be able to review the acts of this Star Chamber.
The administration seeks to avoid the Constitution by applying the order only to foreigners, rather than to U.S. citizens. Guess what: that's largely unconstitutional as well.
The guarantee of due process of law is universal in its application to all persons within the territorial jurisdiction of a state or the United States, without regard to any differences of race, color, or nationality, when they have come within the territory of the United States and have developed substantial connections with this country. 16B Am. Jur.2d Constitutional Law Â§ 928; U.S. v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. 259, 110 S.Ct. 1056, 1064 (1990).
As a matter of international law, it may be argued that, if the foreign state consents to American exercise of such power overseas, i.e., if Afghanistan consents to an American Star Chamber handing out death sentences to Afghans, then such power is legitimately exercised. This would be a matter of treaty, or other such international agreement.
Such a new policy, however, would be contrary to what is arguably an evolving norm of international law, i.e., utilizing international tribunals to try war criminals. In the case of Nuremberg, Rwanda, and the former Yugoslavia, international tribunals were established to handle war crimes. These tribunals have been attacked as conducting mere show trials, which is bad enough. The Bush administration complains, however, that international tribunals do not administer the death penalty.
This is disturbing, even if possibly allowed under international law. Recall that last week, the Justice Department authorized the wiretapping of conversations between prisoners and their attorneys. So much for attorney-client privilege.
What's next: wiretaps in the confessional?
And another question: remember Senator Kerrey? So much for quick justice when an American is accused. What if Vietnam were a superpower seeking to impose a Star Chamber on a feeble and impoverished United States? Does might make right? To some people, it seems that it does.
Note: with respect to Senator Kerrey, and to the Afghan war, I continue to have grave reservations about international criminal tribunals. A military tribunal would be appropriate for Kerrey because he is accused of crimes while a member of the armed forces; that is within the jurisdiction of a military tribunal. In addition, I would not object if those foreigners seized by the United States in the war on terrorism were tried in U.S. civil courts; that is within the jurisdiction of the civil courts. The problem with President Bush's order is that it simply ignores the Constitutional limits on executive power.
The due process of law is not given when the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments are simply ignored. As Justice Davis wrote in Ex parte Milligan, 71 U.S. 2 (1866),
Certainly no part of judicial power of the country was conferred on them, because the Constitution expressly vests it "in one supreme court and such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish," and it is not pretended that the commission was a court ordained and established by Congress. They cannot justify on the mandate of the President, because he is controlled by law, and has his appropriate sphere of duty, which is to execute, not to make, the laws, and there is "no unwritten criminal code to which resort can be had as a source of jurisdiction."
To be blunt, President Bush has no authority under the U.S. Constitution to make such an order. None. Zip. Zero. Zilch. Nada.
Albert Gonzales, a former Texas Supreme Court judge, claimed that there was precedent for the order. Indeed there is. It is bad Abraham Lincoln famously tried opponents of the War Between the States in military courts. The United States Supreme Court unambiguously declared in Ex parte Milligan, however, that it was unconstitutional to try civilians before a military court when the civil courts, i.e., the regular courthouses you see on The Practice, were open and operating, and in no way threatened by the war.
As Justice Davis wrote in Milligan, (read the opinion here),
there are occasions when martial rule can be properly applied. If, in foreign invasion or civil war, the courts are actually closed, and it is impossible to administer criminal justice according to law, then, on the theatre of active military operations, where war really prevails, there is a necessity to furnish a substitute for the civil authority, thus overthrown, to preserve the safety of the army and society; and as no power is left but the military, it is allowed to govern by martial rule until the laws can have their free course. As necessity creates the rule, so it limits its duration; for, if this government is continued after the courts are reinstated, it is a gross usurpation of power. Martial rule can never exist where the courts are open, and in the proper and unobstructed exercise of their jurisdiction. It is also confined to the locality of actual war.
Note the following: no civil courts are "actually closed" in the United States today. There is no "theatre of active military operations, where war really prevails" such that the civil courts cannot function.
This, as the Milligan court noted, is a gross usurpation of power.
The factual circumstances confronted by Milligan, if anything, were more serious than those facing the United States today. Lambdin Milligan, a citizen of Indiana, was arrested for allegedly conspiring to capture an arsenal, free Confederate prisoners, and for intending to join Confederate forces in Missouri. He was brought before a Military Commission, and sentenced to death.
Despite the fact that there was a war going on, the court found that the military trial was unconstitutional.
Very importantly, the court observed that
No graver question was ever considered by this court, nor one which nearly concerns the rights of the whole people; for it is the birthright of every American citizen when charged with crime, to be tried and punished according to law. The power of punishment is alone through the means which the laws have provided for that purpose, and if they are ineffectual, there is an immunity from punishment, no matter how great an offender the individual may be, or how much his crimes may have shocked the sense of justice of the country, or endangered its safety. By the protection of the law human rights are secured; withdraw that protection, and they are at the mercy of wicked rulers, or the clamor of an excited people.
The rule set forth in Ex parte Milligan, then, squarely controls any decision regarding the order issued by President Bush.
The order is unconstitutional, plain and simple.
"No emergency justifies the violation of any of the provisions of the United States Constitution. An emergency...cannot create power...but may allow the exercise of power already in existence, but not exercised except during an emergency." 16B Am. Jur.2d Constitutional Law Â§ 52 (citations omitted).
As the Nebraska Supreme Court put it, the Constitution was adopted in a state of emergency, the limits on the powers of the government were conceived in the light of emergency, and the limits are not changed by emergency. First Trust Co. v. Smith, 134 Neb. 84, 115, 277 N.W. 762, 778 (1938).
For those wondering why such an order was signed, the Washington Post reports that the move was encouraged
for weeks by conservative lawyers from past administrations and other experts who cited precedents dating back to the Civil War. One of them, George Terwilliger, a former high-ranking Justice Department official, said a military tribunal would be appropriate for anyone who commits an act of war against the United States.
In fact, Terwilliger was the former Deputy Attorney General to George Bush. He handled the Florida election cases for President Bush. Although he is now in private practice, he was reported to have been a leading candidate to be head of the FBI.
The administration has sought to justify the order on the grounds that "This is a global war. To have successful prosecutions, we might have to give up sources and methods" in a civilian court. "We don't want to have to do that," Albert Gonzales told ABC News.
The Washington Post, meanwhile, reports that President Bush claimed the tribunals are needed because terrorism could "place at risk the continuity of the operations of the United States government." It is "not practicable," he said, to require the tribunals to abide by the "principles of law and the rules of evidence" that govern U.S. criminal prosecutions.
Does the Taliban have troops on the streets of Washington, DC? No. And yet it's "not practicable" to follow the principles of law and the rules of evidence. To put it mildly, this is a dangerous step for the government to take.
Much like the Patriot Act, which Rep. Ron Paul reports was not given to members to read before it was voted upon. The Patriot Act, by the way, authorizes increased governmental snooping powers which do not require a warrant, and which are therefore contrary to the The Patriot Act is unconstitutional due to the fact that even social emergencies "cannot routinely justify invasions of privacy or restrictions on expression without devaluing and eventually destroying those rights." Halperin v. Kissinger, 606 F.2d 1192, 1201 (D.C. Cir. 1979)(subsequent history omitted), cited in 16B Am. Jur.2d Constitutional Law Â§ 52. (Halperin v. Kissinger, by the way, cites Milligan for the proposition that only when the courthouses are physically closed may normal judicial processes be circumvented).
The reason? "It would be ironic if, in the name of national defense, we would sanction the subversion of one of those liberties which makes the defense of the nation worthwhile." Halperin v. Kissinger, 606 F.2d 1192, 1199 (D.C. Cir. 1979).
So which is it: do conservatives have no sense of irony, or do they have no respect for constitutional liberty?
A pair of Texans ought to be ashamed to follow precedent established by Abraham Lincoln in a war against Texas. A Republican president, and an alleged "conservative," ought to be ashamed to follow the arch-Democrat, FDR.
President Bush should repeal his order. It is unconstitutional, unwise, and unnecessary.

Bush Order on Military Tribunals is Further Evidence
That Government is Abandoning Democracy's Checks and Balances
Statement of Laura W. Murphy, Director
ACLU Washington National Office
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Wednesday, November 14, 2001
WASHINGTON -- The American Civil Liberties Union is deeply disturbed by President Bush's executive order allowing special military tribunals to try non-citizens charged with terrorism. The tribunals would even reach non-citizens in the United States, including lawful permanent residents.
To our knowledge, the move to establish a military tribunal when Congress has not declared war is unprecedented.
We do not believe that the Administration has shown that the constitutional jury trial system does not allow for the prosecution of those accused of terrorist activities. Absent such a compelling justification, the President's decision is further evidence that the Administration is totally unwilling to abide by the checks and balances that are so central to our democracy.
The use of military tribunals would apparently authorize secret trials without a jury and without the requirement of a unanimous verdict and would limit a defendant's opportunities to confront the evidence against him and choose his own lawyer. What's worse, these important legal protections would be removed in a situation where defendants may very well be facing the death penalty.
It is difficult to understand how the Administration can justify the use of a tribunal when the United States has successfully tried in our courts non-citizens accused of terrorist acts, organized crime, and others in situations where the safety of jurors and the disclosure of government intelligence methods were at issue.
As the prosecutions of the 1993 World Trade Center bombers and Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh demonstrate, the government has managed to protect the safety and identity of jurors while achieving convictions in terrorism cases. And there is already a system established to handle classified information in the course of a trial; it is called the Classified Information Procedures Act. For decades, CIPA has adequately balanced national security and due process concerns. The government has made no showing that CIPA procedures would not be adequate in these circumstances as well.
Further, it would be hypocritical of the United States to impose such a tribunal when we have repeatedly protested the use of such courts against U.S. citizens abroad.
Congress has already given the Administration and the Justice Department virtually everything they asked for to fight terrorism. This latest move, combined with the Justice Department's announced intentions to eavesdrop on attorney conversations with inmates and to begin interviewing foreign visitors to the United States, demonstrates the government's increasing willingness to circumvent the requirements of the Bill of Rights.
We call on Congress to exercise its oversight powers before the Bill of Rights in America is distorted beyond recognition.

Bush gives green light to CIA for assassination of named terrorists
'Covert killings to take in less important al-Qaida figures'
David Gow in New York
Monday October 29, 2001
The Guardian
President Bush has given the CIA an explicit go-ahead to carry out covert
missions to assassinate Osama bin Laden and his supporters around the world,
effectively lifting a 25-year ban on such activities.
The US defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, confirmed reports of such a move
yesterday by telling CNN that the US would be acting in self-defence in
carrying out such missions.
The Washington Post reported yesterday that Mr Bush has decided that
executive orders banning assassinations since a series of botched attempts
in the 1960s and 1970s allow him to single out a named terrorist or
terrorists for death by covert action.
Mr Rumsfeld said: "It is not possible to defend yourself against terrorists
at every single location in the world and at every single moment.
"The only way to deal with terrorists is to take the battle to them and find
them and root them out and that's self-defence. We're going after these
people and their organisations and capabilities and to stop them killing
The US president, according to senior government officials quoted by the
Post, signed an order last month known as an intelligence "finding", which
broadens the list of potential targets beyond Bin Laden and his immediate
circle of some 15 operational planners - and beyond Afghanistan.
The CIA, pilloried in some quarters along with the FBI last month for its
fatal failure to detect the movements and plans of the al-Qaida terrorist
network, is said to be willing and able to "take the lives of terrorists
designated by the president".
Mr Bush has apparently circumvented the legal constraints on clandestine
killing missions imposed since the Church committee found in 1975 that plots
against five foreign leaders under presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy and Nixon
had been organised in terms "so ambiguous that it is difficult to be certain
at what levels assassination activity was known and authorised".
The new presidential order, drawing on one signed by President Clinton
against al-Qaida three years ago, apparently overcomes such problems by
making plain that responsibility and accountability rest with the president
and his senior colleagues.
"I would want the president's guidance to be as clear as it could be,
including the names of individuals. You have got to have the political
levels behind you so the intelligence officers are not left hanging," the
recently retired CIA deputy director, John Gannon, told the Post.
But history suggests that covert assassinations remain fraught with danger
and carry a high risk of failure.
Jeffrey Richelson, an intelligence historian and author of a new book on the
CIA, said of pre-1975 efforts: "They never succeeded in killing anyone. They
were the gang that couldn't shoot straight."
Agents carried out numerous inept missions to kill Fidel Castro, using among
other botched devices bacteria in his favourite type of cigar, an exploding
seashell, and a poisoned wet suit. Other botched missions were undertaken in
central America, the Congo and Iraq, though Mr Richelson has said the CIA
did significantly aid the assassins of Che Guevara, and, indirectly, the
overthrow of Chile's Salvador Allende in 1973.
Yesterday's report suggested that President Bush's order could extend well
beyond the al-Qaida network concentrated around Bin Laden and the FBI's 22
"most-wanted" terrorists, with the CIA debating how many of the 35 or more
countries identified as places where the terrorist network is active could
figure on the list.
Andrew Card, White House chief of staff, said yesterday on NBC's Meet the
Press: "It could take years but we are going to do everything we can to rout
the terrorists in Afghanistan and then get them all around the world."
Financiers of the al-Qaida - "the Gucci guys, the guys who write the
cheques", according to one unnamed CIA official - could also be targets but
the report said it was unclear whether Mr Bush had "signed orders that would
amount to individual death warrants".

Personally, I prefer the strategy Israel uses with Palestinian
territories' telephone booths. - They all come pre-installed with explosive devices that can be remotely activated, for example
if and when a certain number is called (like mossad suicide-attack
volunteer recruitment office.)
Maybe US airplanes should have remotely activated explosive devices in them, so that when the next inevitable revenge of a revenge of a revenge highjacking occurs, the people in Washington can just press
the button and explode the plane over the sea.
I mean, now the fighters were too slow to shoot down the three first
planes. (Yeah, it's just a "heroic passengers" cover-story for the
ugly truth..)

Just as an after thought, but perhaps you would like to perform
a suicide attack on the Afghanistan presidential building?
I think there's lots of support for suicide attacks made by Americans
as a revenge to this one. It would be an equally devastating and proper
response to this one, don't you think?

I hate to point out the obvious, but doesn't this whole WTC thing seems to be like it's a mossad operation to
I have no proof, of course, but the economics and the reverse-engineering of the logics of the whole events point to this conclusion.
1) Israel has been very well prepared in that the current and ex-prime ministers have been very well available
and have been talking on international television about this
incident from the moment it started.
2) The below news is very beneficial to Israel
3) Israel benefits the most from this incident politically
4) They have the resources to do something like this
5) Their politicians don't care about killing innocent people
6) They have done it before to the Americans (Sinking one of their ships)
7) The Mossad recruit palestinians for suicide missions and kill the
volunteers before they commit a bombing -> a short extention would be to
use them for their own benefit by having them do suicide attacks in the US to gain support for their policies in the middle east, and have US
attack the neighboring arab countries threatening Israel. 8) Osama has denied responsibility, yes he is "implicated" somehow by
the evidence.
9) Osama would not seem to benefit from this politically
or economically, or gain any support by doing this in the
Arab countries, as has been made clear
10) Iraelis' claim to have warned USA before hand...
etc. etc. etc.
Tons of coincidences and reportings of facts about this whole incident in the news.
Israel is very prominently playing this for all it's
worth, and seems incredibly very well prepared.
Of course, this does not mean that they had anything to do with it.
I'm just pointing out that they are getting the biggest benefit,
together with the military-industrial and spy-complexes of the USA.
Certainly a nice conspiracy theory? ;-)

Terrorist attacks in US - Intelligence memo points to Mossad link
Shahid Ahmed Qureshi
Frontier Post, Pakistan
Updated on 9/16/2001 12:15:20 PM
LONDON: A US military intelligence source revealed details of an internal
intelligence memo that points to the Israeli Mossad intelligence service
having links to the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks.
The intelligence source, who requested his name be withheld, confirmed the
internal US intelligence memo circulated four weeks ago described
information that pointed to the threat of a covert Israeli operation on US
soil to turn mass public opinion against Palestinian Arabs via an apparent
terrorist attack on US interests that would give Israel the green light to
implement a large scale military onslaught against the Palestinian Arab
The 11 September attack has been described by experts as being too
sophisticated for a lone terrorist group to execute.
"This attack required a high level of military precision and the resources
of an advanced intelligence agency.
In addition, the attackers would have needed to be extremely familiar with
both air force one flight operations, civil airline flight paths and aerial
assault tactics on sensitive US cities like Washington, Stated David Stern
an expert on Israeli intelligence operations.
The attacks targeted the Pentagon, World Trade Center towers, with the White
House and air force also being targets according to the FBI.
"The attacks have certainly turned US public opinion firmly back in Israel's
favour after 11 months of Palestinian uprising, heavy criticism of Israel
over war crimes allegations and racism by a UN conference in Durban.
The attacks serve no Arab group or nation's interests but their timing came
in the midst of international condemnation of Israel for its policy of death
squad assassination of Palestinian political and police figures", added
If verified, the news of Israel's involvement in the US attack welcome as no
surprise to intelligence experts.
The state of Israel has a long history of covert operations against Western
targets with attacks on the King David Hotel, USS Liberty, murder of a
Scandinavian UN envoy as well as espionage against the US during the
Jonathan Pollard case.
On Wednesday the US defence Department issued a warning to its officials to
halt the leak of information on the investigation which it says is happening
on a daily basis since the attacks occurred.

@_subject: IRS 'Missing' 2300 Laptops 
01/08/2002 - Updated 03:02 PM ET More than 2,300 IRS computers missing
WASHINGTON (AP) Â The Internal Revenue Service, which holds taxpayers
strictly liable for accurate tax returns, is working to account for more
than 2,300 computers that have gone missing over the past three years.
   Tech Extras   Sign up for TechÂs free e-mail newsletter Search USA TODAY for earlier stories on this subject A recent Treasury Department audit was unable to determine whether the
laptops and other small computers were lost, stolen or simply not properly
documented. The IRS is reasonably sure that none contained sensitive
taxpayer data or could provide a way for hackers to break into the tax
agency's secure main computers.
IRS officials said Tuesday they are locating the computers, most of which
are older than three years and would normally be replaced anyway. Toni
Zimmerman, IRS chief of information technology services, said some were
probably stolen or lost but that most were misplaced through bookkeeping
"Over the course of events, they were coded wrong in the system,"
Zimmerman said.
Still, a senior senator suggested that Congress require concrete
improvements before approving more money for a long-term IRS computer
systems upgrade.
"An agency that requires taxpayers to show every receipt can't find 2,300
computers," said Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, ranking Republican on the
Senate Finance Committee. "The IRS wouldn't accept from a taxpayer the
nonanswer it has given."
In a letter dated Monday, Grassley asked Mitch Daniels, head of the White
House Office of Management and Budget, to consider placing a hold on the
IRS budget until the situation gets better. The IRS budget for fiscal 2002
is $9.5 billion, and Congress has approved over $391 million through 2004
for the computer modernization project.
The IRS got a positive opinion on its inventory controls last year from
the congressional General Accounting Office and is determined to get
better yet, Zimmerman said.
"We want to show that we are fiscally responsible and taxpayers should
feel confident with our processes," she said.
The missing computers were uncovered by a Treasury inspector general
during an audit late last year that also found six unaccounted-for IRS
firearms and hundreds of lost investigative items such as badges and
communications gear.
All told, auditors could not account for 2,332 laptops, microcomputers and
microservers covering the period between October 1998 and Sept. 30, 2001.
The IRS had 163,000 computers total as of September.
IRS officials said they are working on a new system allowing the agency to
discern between computers that are lost, stolen or damaged and improve its
ability to investigate incidents of missing property.
Of the six missing guns, one was lost in an ocean boating accident and
five were stolen from vehicles. Fifty communications devices, 40
identification badges and 15 pieces of electronic surveillance gear were
also reported missing, which auditors said "could compromise the public's
safety or ongoing investigations."

(sent again - original message did not get through)
WASHINGTON--A U.S. congressman said Monday that he intended to change a
controversial copyright law to allow consumers to override technologies that
prevent them from making digital copies of music, movies and software. Rep. Rick Boucher, D-Va., said he plans to introduce a bill that would
eliminate the "anti-circumvention" clause of the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act (DMCA), a 1998 law that updated copyright laws for the digital
era. Intended to discourage piracy, the clause has come under increasing fire
over the past year by people who say it imposes severe limits on the rights
of consumers to make personal backup copies or otherwise control music they
have purchased. The clause has inspired high-profile court battles and made
a minor celebrity out of Dmitry Sklyarov, the Russian programmer jailed for
writing a program that defeated a copy-protection measure in Adobe Systems'
eBook software. Boucher told an audience of musicians, lawyers and music industry executives
at the Future of Music policy summit that his bill would modify section 1201
of the DMCA to allow consumers to defeat copy-protection measures for
legitimate personal uses, but it would still outlaw circumvention efforts
for piracy. "I'm very concerned about the DMCA," Boucher said. "There's an increasing
number of instances in which unjust results are reached." On Monday, Boucher pointed out that Vivendi Universal's Universal Music
Group will soon release its new CDs in copy-protected form, making them
impossible to play on personal computers and some CD systems as well. Consumers should be able to use computer programs to defeat that copy
protection, he said. Other interesting opinions of Rick Boucher can be on his website at:

Reply-To: Anti_Immigration at yahoogroups.com
[Below is a discussion between Nissan who is a right-wing Israeli Jew and Bob from Michigan who is a Right-wing Christian that I found at  - THIS IS A MUST Dear Nissan & BCC friends, What is the definition of hypocrisy? Advocating one set of rules for yourself and another set of rules for others? Jews in Israel oppose multi-culturalism but Jews in America are forcing multi-culturalism on WASP America. Jews in Israel are very strict about who can immigrate to Israel, but Jews in America have forced an immigration policy upon our nation that is 90% non-white and 95% non-Christian. [Side Bar: For more information about Jewish influence upon American Immigration policy go read "The Jewish Stake in America's Changing Demography, Reconsidering a Misguided Immigration Policy," By Stephen Steinlight at  - It is written by a Jew who was formerly pro-immigration and he explains why most Jews are pro-immigration. He talks about the immense and formidable Jewish political power in America. He talks about Jewish control of Hollywood and the news media. He talks about Jewish Supremacism inculcated in young Jewish Americans. He talks about how Jews have divided loyalties and how they often put the interests of Israel ahead of American interests. He talks about the intentional program of the Internationalists to make White's a minority in America in the near future via unlimited immigration and open borders policies. He talks about the Jewish affinity for Marxism. He talks about the Jewish drive for remaking America into a pluralistic and secular society. He explains that MTV is a tool of indoctrination which is being used to promote a radical agenda that includes multi-racialism. You must read this article and pass it on. There are a growing number of Jews who are coming around to conservatism, I just hope they come around sooner rather than later.]
Jews in America control and finance strongly anti-Christian groups like the ACLU, People for the American Way (PAW), Americans United for Separation of Church and State and many other such groups. This is anti-Christian bigotry. But most Jews (like you?) are only concerned about one kind of bigotry, "anti-semitism." You are completely oblivious to the anti-Christian bigotry of your fellow Jews. That is hypocrisy my friend and I am damned angry about it. It is OK for Jewish Hollywood to attack my values and beliefs in nearly EVERY DAMN MOVIE THEY MAKE IN JEWISH HOLLYWOOD, but you Jews can't stop whining about my supposed "anti-semitism." You have a double standard my friend. On the one hand you support the idea that Israel should be a nation that enshrines support for Judaism in its legal code, but on the other hand you do not think America should be a Christian nation with support for Christianity written into our legal code. Jews in America think that America should be a secular nation. I am telling you the truth when I say, I love Jews. I love the real Jews who love Moses, love the Torah, are pro-Life, anti-Homosexual, pro-Gun, anti-socialism. The real Jews are my allies in the political arena. I hate the bastard Left-wing Jews who have turned America away from her Protestant Christian roots. I want those atheist fag-loving gun-hating socialist Jews out of America. Do you likewise want those atheist fag-loving gun-hating socialist Jews out of Israel? Do you hate those atheist fag-loving gun-hating socialist Jews as much as I do? These Left-wing Jews are the CANCER OF AMERICA. It is sad to report the truth that 80 or 90% of Jews in America are far Left-wing, anti-Christian bigots who support abortion rights, homosexual rights, pornography, gun control laws, socialized medicine and environmental extremism.
It is so very difficult for human beings to set aside their personal prejudices and look at each situation objectively, but that is what I am going to ask you to do. I am asking you to try to pretend that you are a Christian. I ask you to see things from my point of view. I will do the same in this email. I will try to see things from your point of view. First, let me start with an analogy. Lets pretend that you are an Israeli. Lets pretend that you are an agent in the Mossad. Lets pretend that you have penetrated to the highest levels of Bin Ladens organization. Lets say that you are at a meeting of all of the major leaders of Bin Laden's terrorist organization. At this meeting of 60 of the highest leaders of Bin Laden's organization you discover that they are planning a major terrorist action against civilians in Israel that will kill perhaps a 100, 000 Israeli's. Now here is your dilema: The Mossad has provided you with a Bomb, but you only have one bomb. This is your choice, you can use the bomb to destroy the entire leadership of your enemy, Bin Ladens terrorist organization and the approximately 60 "Generals" in Bin Laden's organization or you can go to the staging site where multiple thousands of low level but highly trained terrorists are getting ready to depart for their mission of terror in Israel. Here is the question, where do you use the bomb? Do you focus on the Generals who are the brains in the army of evil or do you focus on the far more numerous low level peons in the army of evil? Who should you try to neutralize? The leaders or the far more numerous peons. I assert that if you cut off the head the body will die. I assert that you need to focus on those who are supplying the money and the brains and the plans for the Army of evil. Here is my assertion that I hope you will agree with... it is much wiser to focus on the leadership in the army of evil. Do you agree with this as a general principle? I think it is a foregone conclusion. I think that the answer is obvious. I think it would be foolish to do anything other than focus on the leadership in the army of evil. You were wrong. You asserted that I am anti-semitic. I am not. I am focused like a laser on the Generals in the Army of evil. It is sad and unfortunate that such a high percentage of the Jews are Generals in the army of evil that is destroying America. I want you to get inside the heart of a Christian. I want you to see things from a Christian point of view. Please try very hard. Now lets look at the facts about Jews in America and the wealth they control and the influence they wield in our nations capital. These atheist liberal Jews are extremely powerful and they are totally anti-Christian. The liberal Jews who control Hollywood are using their media to indoctrinate the American populace in pro-homosexual, pro-sexual immorality, anti-Christian, anti-conservative concepts of every kind. The liberal Jews who control the ACLU are viciously anti-Christian and are destroying America's Christian underpinnings. Please I beg you to go into your prayer closet and pray before writing back to me. Ask YHWH to help you to see things from a Christian point of view. Lets look at what these Jews, who are generals in the army of evil, that is destroying the moral fabric of America, lets look at what they have done. Hollywood has mocked family values for decades. Hollywood has promoted sex outside of marriage and promoted the entire sexual revolution. Hollywood has warped the thinking of several generations of American youth until we have reached the point where our families are in near total chaos. I blame this on the army of evil called liberalism. Who are the "generals" in the army of evil liberalism in America? It is true that without Jewish money the Democratic party would fold. It is true that 50% of the money that goes to the Democratic party comes from Jews, which is very shocking when you consider that Jews are only 2% of the total population in America. Please try to see this from the conservative Christian point of view. These Jews are wrecking our nation. Yes there are a 100 times, a thousand times more liberals who are non-Jews. But friend we need to look at the Generals in the army of evil and see what percentage of the Generals are liberal Jews. We need to see what percentage of the money that finances left-wing organizations, comes from Jews. Friend, you know better than I do how much money the liberal Jews give to support the entire panopoly of far left-wing organizations. I am asserting that if all Jews in America were right wing, the Democratic party would be DEAD. Liberalism would be DEAD! Jews have lead or financed every far left-wing cause in America. Were there a 100 times more non-Jews in these left-wing organizations, YES, but they had neither the money nor the positions of power in those left-wing org's that the Jews did. These atheist Jews are the Generals in satan army of evil that is wrecking America. This information is not anti-semitic. This is truth. You know that I am not lying. You know that everything I have written in this email is factual. It is very sad that 80 to 90% of American Jews are far left-wing. It is very sad that most Jews support the Clintons, support the homosexual rights movement, support the ACLU, support gun control laws, support banning every mention of Christianity from the public schools, support the marxist feminist movement, support the interpretation of the first amendment to include pornography, support socialized medicine and support socialism and big government in general. It is very sad that Jews were in the forefront of the communist movement in every western nation. It is very sad that Jews have been deceived and have rejected Moses, rejected G-ds Law and have rejected G-d himself. But it is time for you to come to grips with this truth: Jews have been very damaging to America. Will you list all the good things Jews have done? Scientific and medical discoveries, etc, etc. I will list a hundred times more damaging things that these atheist liberal Jews have done to America. It is the liberal Jews, the so called Jewish "humanists" who have brought America to this point of moral implosion. They have been weighed in the scales of justice and they have been found wanting. THIS INFORMATION IS NOT ANTI-SEMITIC. THIS IS THE TRUTH AND NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH. STOP USING THAT BLUDGEON ON ME. I AM NOT ANTI-SEMITIC. If you call me anti-semitic then what names shall be left for you to use on the real haters, the real Nazi's? I DO NOT HATE ALL JEWS. I love you and I love all of the Jews who are politically conservative and allies of the Christian Right. I would love to have you as a neighbor and I welcome conservative Jews like you into my heart and into our nation. But further than that I don't even wish ill for the liberal Jews. I wish that you would convert them to Judaism. I wish you would convert them to believe in the G-d of Abraham, Issac and Jacob and turn them away from their current state of atheism. Yes, I focus on the Jews and I insist that it is not anti-semitic for me to do so. I attack the Jews because I see them as the Generals in the evil army of those promoting the leftist agenda that is destroying all that I hold dear. This is self-defense and nothing more. These atheist liberal Jews are super wealthy, super successful and super influential and they are using all of that power to destroy the America that I knew in my youth. It is not wrong and it is not anti-semitic to tell this truth.
Now I am going to try to see things from your point of view. Help me if I misunderstand. The Jewish people have collective memories of thousands of years of persecution culminating in the Holocaust. You and other Jews look at the things I write and your first thought is about where thinking like this could lead if the majority of Christians started thinking this way about Jews. It is a frightening thought to a Jew. So even if this Bob guy is a decent fellow and he is not really one of the haters, you must marginalize Bob because of the potential fearful possibilities of these ideas about Jews spreading in the minds of the sheeple. I can feel the fear in my own heart. If I was a Jew I also would fear such thoughts and such writings because of the potential end result of such ideas becoming dominant in the minds of the majority populace. I think I understand your point of view (Do you understand mine?). But my answer to you is to work harder on converting Jews to conservatism and converting Jews to faithful Judaism so that they are not enemies of the Christian Right. The answer is NOT to shut up the truth about what 80 to 90% of Jews are doing in America. The answer is NOT to belittle and disparage a sincere Christian who is acting only in self-defense by calling him an ANTI-SEMITE! Can you see things from my point of view? I am sincerely yours with the greatest of respect for you, Your friend, Bob from Michigan.
PS - I do not believe in "conspiracy theory." I believe that all of history is a battle of ideas. I believe that most Jews are my enemy in the battle of ideas, so please stop trying to tag me with the "conspiracy" label. PPS - SEE MY COMMENTS ON YOUR LETTER IN ALL "CAPS" BELOW.

@_subject: Is George W. Bush God's President? 
January 10, 2002|2:05 PM
Rudolph Giuliani, a devout but not excessively rigorous Catholic, announced
that `there was some divine guidance in the President being elected.'
Is George W. Bush God's President?
by Joe Conason
Do tax cuts for the wealthy represent the will of God?
What might normally be an impertinent and perhaps offensive question
suddenly seems entirely reasonable after hearing George W. Bush's
ungrammatical but passionate pledge to defend the tax cuts his
administration provided to the richest, smallest segment of American
citizens, at the cost of his own life if need be. The vow he uttered during
his town-hall meeting in California over the weekend - "Not over my dead body
will they raise your taxes!" - was the strongest he's made on any subject
since his promise to deliver Osama bin Laden to justice "dead or alive."
Even allowing for hyperbole, such edgy remarks indicate what matters most to
Mr. Bush. For the moment, however, he appears more capable of fulfilling the
former promise than the latter. And since it has lately become respectable
to discuss his elevation to the nation's highest office as a matter of
divine will, Mr. Bush's deep determination to empty the Treasury into the
pockets of friends and supporters may likewise signify the unknowable agenda
of the Almighty.
Unbelievers will scoff at such notions, but in the wake of Sept. 11, the
idea that a higher power ordained the inauguration of Mr. Bush is no longer
confined to the loonier fringes of the religious right. While the President
and the First Lady modestly demur whenever this topic comes up, others
around the Oval Office assert that they are convinced. "I think President
Bush is God's man at this hour," a top White House aide told a religious
publication not long ago. Ralph Reed, the former director of the Christian
Coalition who now chairs the G.O.P. in Georgia, says his fellow evangelicals
believe God selected the President because "He knew George Bush had the
ability to lead in this compelling way."
Nor is this revelation confined solely to Protestant conservatives. Two days
before Christmas, Rudolph Giuliani, a devout but not excessively rigorous
Catholic, announced his own opinion that "there was some divine guidance in
the President being elected." In this sentiment, the Time magazine "Man of
the Year" was swiftly seconded by a Catholic bishop. (Again, a skeptic might
impiously wonder why the Lord didn't simply bless Mr. Bush with the actual
majority of votes. But faith is nothing without mystery.)
The implications of all this are obviously profound. If the President is
indeed guided by Providence in lavishing additional billions upon those who
already enjoy so much material abundance - even while the numbers of
unemployed, uninsured and homeless soar - then his ascension may represent a
millennial reversal of heavenly policy.
Until now, few directives have been clearer than the guidance enunciated by
prophets of both the Old and New Testaments regarding earthly greed. "Woe to
you who are rich," Jesus told his disciples, "for you have already received
your comfort." The impoverished carpenter also reportedly informed a
well-heeled acquaintance that it is "easier for a camel to go through the
eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God." His
best-known speech included the admonition that "you cannot serve both God
and Mammon."
Universally familiar as those statements are, they are reliably among the
most widely ignored. Entire schools of theology, across all ecumenical
lines, have long been devoted to parsing a convenient loophole in such
injunctions. They aren't the sort of Biblical quotations that politicians
try to post in public schools, or that televangelists cite as evidence that
Republicans are the party of God. What a relief it would be if the tax
policy of the Bush administration means that we no longer have to worry
about worshipping the golden calf.
Divine inspiration may not be a persuasive explanation for Mr. Bush's fiscal
schemes, which are pushing the government into deficit and threatening to
prolong the recession. It is indeed hard to imagine that any omniscient
power would prefer a $254 million tax break for Enron to a cut in payroll
taxes for the working poor. But it's just as difficult to credit any of the
more earthly justifications emanating from the White House press office.
In any case, not all branches of the federal government have awakened yet to
the new dispensation. On the same day that Mr. Bush made his "dead body"
remark, a report issued by the Congressional Budget Office disparaged his
tax cuts as useless for reviving the economy. According to the C.B.O.
analysis, better results would ensue from more progressive cuts in payroll
and sales taxes. While the nonpartisan report appropriately said nothing
about theology, its recommendations were highly reminiscent of that
old-fashioned scriptural preference for the poor and the toilers.
So perhaps Mr. Bush's supporters should reconsider their political epiphany.
The followers of the last public figure who claimed to be executing God's
will are now dodging daisy-cutters.

Reply-To: Conspiracy Theory Research List Israel Kills Palestinian Boys, Steals Organs For Transplants
Teheran Times.com
AL-KHALIL (IRNA) - The Zionist state has tacitly admitted that doctors at the Israeli forensic institute at Abu Kabir had extracted the vital organs of three Palestinian teenage children killed by the Israeli Army nearly ten days ago. Â  Zionist Minister of Health Nessim Dahhan said in response to a question by Arab member of the Zionist Parliament 'Knesset', Ahmed Teibi, on Tuesday that he couldn't deny that organs of Palestinian youths and children killed by the Israeli forces were taken out for transplants or scientific research. Â  "I couldn't say for sure that something like that (taking out the organs) didn't happen." Â  Teibi said he had received credible evidence proving that Israeli doctors at the forensic institute extracted such vital organs as the heart, kidneys, and liver from the bodies of Palestinian youths and children killed by the Israeli Army in Gaza and the West Bank. Â  The Israeli authorities normally detain the bodies of martyred Palestinians for a few days without any explanation. Â  The Israeli Army on December 30 killed three Palestinian boys, aged 14-15 near Khan Younis in unclear circumstances. Â  The army issued conflicting reports on the killing, while Palestinian sources charged that Israeli troops murdered the three unarmed boys in cold blood. Â  The bodies of the three boys were handed over to the Palestinians for burial on 6 January. Â  However, shortly before burial, Palestinian medical authorities examined the bodies and found out that the main vital organs were missing from the bodies. Â  The Israeli media have nearly completely ignored the affair. Â  (IRNA)

Scientist Lee says data he copied were non-vital 'junk'
By Richard Benke, Associated Press, 1/12/2002
LOS ALAMOS, N.M. - In a new memoir, former Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee
says the nuclear ''crown jewels'' he was accused of mishandling were really
the ''crown junk'' and were not vital to national security.
The files he downloaded were old, with much of the information already
public and very little of it classified, Lee says in ''My Country Versus
Me,'' published by Hyperion. He says he copied the material onto tapes
because he had lost files before and did not trust the computer system.
He describes himself as a loyal ''Cold Warrior'' for the United States, yet
says the FBI threatened him with execution if he did not confess to giving
nuclear secrets to China.
''I want to share through this book how I fell into a trap,'' Lee says,
''one slippery step at a time, not even realizing what was happening until
it was too late.''
Lee, a Taiwanese-born naturalized US citizen, was arrested in December 1999
and indicted on 59 felony counts alleging he transferred nuclear weapons
information to portable computer tapes. He was held in solitary confinement
for nine months, but never charged with spying.
As the government's case crumbled, Lee pleaded guilty to a felony count of
downloading sensitive material, and was set free. The mishandling of the
case was an embarrassment for the FBI and the Justice Department.
While Lee was behind bars, one senior scientist called the files ''the crown
Lee says the downloaded tapes were all work-related, routine, and contained
in a secure area at Los Alamos National Laboratory.
''In fact, the `crown jewels' are largely the crown junk,'' he says. ''This
is the biggest nuclear weapons secret that LANL and the government have to
Lee says he copied the files - needed to design computer simulations for
nuclear explosions - so he could have backup copies.
''In 1993, I lost several files as a result of a computer system conversion
at the lab,'' he says. ''One of the codes I lost was about nuclear reactor
safety. ... This was an important code, and it was gone.''
A call to the US attorney's office in Albuquerque yesterday was not
immediately returned.
Lee, who has been a US citizen since 1974 and spent 20 years doing
top-secret work at the lab, is suing the government for defamation and
claims he was targeted because he is ethnic Chinese.
In a recent deposition made public yesterday, former energy secretary Bill
Richardson said that ethnicity was not a factor in his firing of Lee or the
decision to investigate him for possible security breaches.

Labour MPs protest as CIA gets power to snoop on any house in Britain
By Severin Carrell
13 January 2002
The CIA has recruited British defence and hi-tech companies in an attempt to
acquire the latest technology for its spying missions and
The British firms, including the mobile-phone company Hutchison 3G and
aerospace contractor BAE Systems, are helping the CIA to develop
sophisticated map reading, 3-D mapping and computer communications
In conflicts such as the war in Afghanistan, these projects would
potentially allow CIA agents in the war zone to translate an obscure
reference to a building, village or cave into a 3-D photo-realistic map of
the area via laptops and satellite phones.
One project funded by the CIA uses raw data provided by the Ordnance Survey
based on its digital maps of the UK, sparking criticism from MPs.
One Labour MP said the projects raised major questions about whether these
relationships were in Britain's interests. Alan Simpson, a senior member of
the left-wing Campaign group of backbenchers, said: "Where does this take
the CIA? If we're giving them the ability to plot grid references to any
house in Britain, it raises fundamental questions about whether this is in
the national interest."
The CIA, the world's largest and most powerful intelligence agency, has been
under immense pressure to catch up with the rapid developments and spread of
computer and internet technology over the past decade. Its directors admit
that the size and reach of the internet has left it struggling to catch up.
In 1999, it set up a unique private company called In-Q-Tel to invest about
$30m a year in hi-tech companies and research projects.
"We make investments in companies where we have a strategic interest in the
technology," a spokeswoman said.
Five British firms have become collaborators or contractors for In-Q-Tel
through a US-dominated alliance of more than 220 private companies,
government agencies and universities called the Open GIS Consortium (OGC) to
develop common technological standards for computers.
In one project overseen by OGC, Hutchison 3G is a partner with In-Q-Tel and
five US firms to design a system which allows wireless links between
computers. The mobile-phone company Vodaphone is a contractor and the
British companies Laser-Scan and its owner, Yeoman Group, have become
observers in the project.
In another project, In-Q-Tel has hired a division of BAE Systems and
Laser-Scan, which makes digital and internet maps, to develop ways of
linking geographical data from separate sources Â a technique known as
inter-operability. This project uses Ordnance Survey data.
Laser-Scan is also involved with the Military Mapping Project, where the CIA
and US Army is developing further sophisticated 3-D mapping techniques, such
as sending them via the internet, in a restricted project also overseen by
British companies appear to have avoided the most controversial projects
funded by In-Q-Tel. One US firm called SafeWeb had been paid to give the CIA
the ability to snoop on internet web sites without being detected.
All the companies and agencies involved insisted the projects were above
board, and Ordnance Survey stressed that its data was used simply for
research purposes.
In-Q-Tel denied that it required its contractors to sign secrecy deals with
the CIA, or expected to control the results of its projects with OGC.

On Behalf Of Daniel Tomasevich

This article adds to the discussion that the Taliban are PoWs.
   Once in front of a court or tribunal, the Pentagon might argue that
   the Taliban were not the government of Afghanistan and that their
   armed forces were not the armed forces of a party to the convention.
   The problem here is that the convention is widely regarded as an
   accurate statement of customary international law, unwritten rules
   binding on all. Even if the Taliban were not formally a party to the
   convention, both they and the US would still have to comply.

DRUGS SQUAD FUMES AS BOOKSHOP SHIELDS READER
Prize-Winning US Writers Queue Up To Defend Privacy Of Customer Who Bought
Uncle Fester's Illicit Manual
It never won a Pulitzer or appeared on the New York Times bestseller lists
but a 400-page book about the manufacture of illicit drugs by an author
known as Uncle Fester is at the centre of a legal battle over the privacy
of the US book-buying public. In what has been described as a landmark case
for the US book industry, the Tattered Cover bookshop in Denver, Colorado,
has spent 18 months resisting the attempts of both police and courts to
obtain the identity of a customer who purchased Uncle Fester's opus,
Advanced Techniques of Clandestine Drug Laboratories .
Many of the country's most celebrated authors, publishers and booksellers
are supporting the shop, which has argued that handing over the information
would be a serious attack on free speech.
'There is a right to privacy in this country and that includes the right to
read what we like without government interference,' says award-winning
novelist Michael Chabon. 'If the police get what they are after in this
case, what is to stop them demanding to know all sorts of things - like who
has been reading books about any subject the authorities deem to be
'dangerous', such as religious beliefs that don't fit into the so-called
Chabon, who won the Pulitzer last year for his novel The Amazing Adventures
of Kavalier and Clay, is one of several leading writers, including David
Eggers, Dorothy Allison and the children's book author Daniel Handler, who
have giving financial support to the Tattered Cover's legal defence fund,
along with the American Booksellers' Foundation.
'People shop in bookstores on the understanding that their choices are
confidential,' says Chris Finan, president of the ABF's Foundation for Free
Expression. 'There are a lot of books about subjects - mental health,
sexual dysfunction - that we do not want our wives or husbands to know
we've been reading about. If people know the police can get that kind of
information they will not shop for those books.'
The case centres on a raid by drug enforcement officers at a trailer park
near Denver in March last year. The Uncle Fester book and another called
Advanced Techniques of Clandestine Psychedelic Drug Laboratories were found
inside a trailer owned by a man suspected of operating a methamphetamine
lab. An envelope discovered in his rubbish bin contained an invoice from
the Tattered Cover.
The following day four plainclothes officers arrived at the shop with a
search warrant, demanding to know if the books were bought there and, if
so, by whom. The shop's owner, Joyce Meskis, refused to provide the
information. 'It is not our job to do the police's work for them,' she said.
Denver police then asked that it enforce the subpoena. At a subsequent
hearing, lawyers for the bookshop argued the police had failed to interview
other witnesses who could have helped convict the suspect. Details of a
customer's purchasing record were not sufficiently important to the
criminal case to justify the 'chilling effect' that releasing such
information would have on the right to free speech enshrined in the First
Amendment, they said.
However, the court upheld the police request - a decision which has been
challenged by the shop's owners in the State's Supreme Court. A ruling on
the appeal is expected in the next few weeks.
The case has echoes of that brought by Kenneth Starr against two bookshops
in Washington DC during his investigation into the Monica Lewinsky
'scandal'. When it emerged that Lewinsky - who was said to have given
President Clinton several books as presents - was a regular customer at the
shops, Starr demanded to see her purchase records. The shops' owners
resisted his request, but the case never reached court after Lewinsky
struck a deal with the former Independent Counsel.
Finan said yesterday there was a growing problem with authorities seeking
private information from bookshops. 'I'm afraid this may be a bad idea
whose time has come, and the chilling effect on publishing could be very
serious indeed. In the Lewinsky case, a false rumour went around that the
bookshops were going to comply with Starr's request. The effect of that was
they saw a big fall-off in business. People trust bookstores to protect
them. If they don't have that trust, they will not shop there.'
The Tattered Cover, spread over four floors in downtown Denver, is a
required stop on the book tour schedule for every bestselling author and
has a reputation for stocking radical, independently published books that
have little chance of finding shelf space in chain stores such as Borders
and Barnes and Noble.
Meskis said she had been heartened by the support she and her staff had
received from writers, publishers and the public. More than 400 people
turned up at a fund-raising event at a San Francisco bookshop last night.
'Like us, they realise that everyone in society has to do what they can to
uphold the rule of law but that we also have an obligation to the community
to protect the constitution. When you have one responsibility bumping up
against another, then that's when the courts should decide.'

Homeland Security, Homeland Profits
By Wayne Madsen
Special to CorpWatch
December 21, 2001
WASHINGTON, DC -- Recent moves to beef up intelligence gathering in the wake of the September 11th terrorist attacks have civil libertarians concerned that law enforcement agencies will entangle many law abiding citizens and social justice groups in their surveillance missions. Intelligence networks are setting their sights on the Internet, which up to now has had no clear privacy guidelines. Under the provisions of the inaptly named anti-terrorism act, "USA-PATRIOT," the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), National Security Agency (NSA), Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and a number of other smaller law enforcement agencies are looking for ways to monitor the Internet and mine useful intelligence from it. And new technology makes it easier than ever to spy on the Internet.
Although law enforcement and intelligence agencies claim they are merely looking for information to counter future acts of terrorism, the definition of "terrorism" is being expanded to cover non-violent groups that have traditionally used the Internet to marshal resistance to corporate-inspired globalization. Politicians are already painting dissent as "unpatriotic" and therefore somehow linked to terrorism.
Meanwhile, a phalanx of software companies, consultants, and defense contractors stand to reap billions of dollars over the next few years by selling surveillance and information-gathering systems to government agencies and the private sector.
Technology Already in the Hands of Law Enforcement
Law enforcement agencies like the FBI already have at their disposal a massive information sharing network through which federal, state, local, and foreign police forces can exchange information on groups felt to pose a threat. The system, RISSNET, or Regional Information Sharing System Network, which existed before the September 11th attacks, recently got a boost when Congress authorized additional money for it in the USA PATRIOT Act.
RISSNET is a secure intranet that connects 5,700 law enforcement agencies in all 50 states, as well as agencies in Ontario and Quebec, the District of Columbia, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and Australia. According to sources close to the Washington Metropolitan Police, data on targeted local groups such as the Alliance for Global Justice, the anti-World Bank/International Monetary Fund activist organization, has been shared with other jurisdictions through RISSNET.
RISSNET has also been used to coordinate the monitoring of the activities of anti-globalization protestors in Seattle, Quebec City, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Washington DC and Genoa. For example, when the FBI seized network server logs from Independent Media Center (IMC) in Seattle during the April 2001 anti-free trade protests in Quebec City, RISSNET was used to coordinate activities across jurisdictional boundaries. The IMC, founded during the 1999 WTO protests, allows activists and independent journalists to post directly to its site.
State and metropolitan police intelligence units also monitor the web sites of activist organizations in their jurisdictions. All RISS intelligence is archived by an Orwellian-sounding entity called MAGLOCLEN or "Middle Atlantic-Great Lakes Organized Crime Law Enforcement Network." There are other regional RISS intelligence centers around the country with equally mysterious acronyms. MAGLOCLEN, a nerve center headquartered in Newtown, Pennsylvania, distributes political intelligence to all police departments hooked up to RISSNET.
MAGLOCLEN allows police investigators to link various activist groups and members through the Link Association Analysis sub-system, a relational data base that identifies the "friends and families" of groups and individuals. The Telephone Record Analysis sub-system can call up records of phone calls of targeted groups and individuals. A suspect group's banking and other commercial data can be monitored by the Financial Analysis sub-system. And through a system that would have been the envy of J. Edgar Hoover, police and federal agents can also call up profiles that provide specific information on the composition of organizations, including their membership lists. The Justice Department has instituted a project called RISSNET II, which directly links the individual databases contained within the various RISS centers.
The FBI also runs its own intranet called Law Enforcement On-line or "LEO," which allows it to communicate intelligence with select other law enforcement agencies. In the aftermath of September 11th , the FBI is under pressure to open up LEO to more police agencies so they can have access to more real-time intelligence. If Attorney General John Ashcroft lifts restrictions placed on the FBI's collection of political intelligence, undoubtedly information on the First Amendment activities of American citizens will wind up in the Bureau's computer databases.
"There has been no indication that the FBI needs expanded spying powers," says Center for Constitutional Rights attorney Michael Ratner. "We should learn from history; spying on dissent is not only unlawful but it is abusive."
This kind of surveillance is not new. In the 1960s and 70s, the FBI's Counter Intelligence Program, known as COINTELPRO, was used to gather personal details on the lives and habits of a wide array of activists ranging from public figures like Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., actress Jane Fonda and noted pediatrician Benjamin Spock, to members of local anti-war and civil rights groups. This information was often used to disrupt lawful organizing and protest activities.
A modern-day FBI list might include any group deemed "terrorist" by any law enforcement agencies, the military, or criminal prosecutors. That could subject organizations as varied -- and unconnected to terrorism -- as Earth First, Greenpeace, the American Indian Movement, the Zapatista National Liberation Front, ACT UP, and their supporters to a wide array of high-tech surveillance and eavesdropping tools.
Chief among spy agency tools is an e-mail sniffing program known as Carnivore. Changes brought about by USA-PATRIOT allow federal law enforcement officials to petition a secretive federal court called the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for warrants to tap phones, read e-mail, or break and enter into homes or offices to conduct searches and plant bugging devices. These spy activities can be carried out without proof that an organization has links to terrorists or foreign intelligence agencies.
To read e-mail the FBI can order an Internet Service Provider to place a special monitoring computer called Carnivore (now renamed Data Collection System 1000) on its network servers. The FBI can then select the e-mail of surveillance targets for capture and storage. Not content with this device, the FBI now seeks to expand its surveillance capability to the entire Internet.
Making a Buck off of Government Spying
Companies that are positioning themselves to help the government surveill the web came out in force at a recent Homeland Security Conference in Washington. They included Oracle, Microsoft, Information Builders, Choice Point, Man Tech, AMS, and Booz Allen & Hamilton. Government speakers from civilian and military agencies all stressed that they urgently need the technology to store surveillance-derived intelligence and exchange it with other agencies. If these corporations step up to the plate on developing new surveillance, monitoring, and biometric ID systems, they stand to make billions.
Companies like Top Layer Networks, Inc. of Westboro, Massachusetts, are developing ways for the FBI to install surveillance systems at a few key Internet hubs which would allow federal agents to remotely flip a switch and pound a few keys to begin monitoring the e-mail or web-based mail of any targeted group or individual. According to chief Top Layer engineer Ken Georgiades, the firm is working with a number of partners to develop new standards for the legal interception of communications at the Internet Service Provider level and at higher gigabit speeds.
The higher gigabit intercept equipment would be placed at major Internet backbone hubs in strategic locations like Washington, DC, the San Francisco Bay Area, Chicago, Dallas, and Los Angeles. Georgiades said that the 1994 Communications Assistance to Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) does not currently extend to the Internet and only applies to telecommunications companies. However, the fact that Top Layer and its unspecified partners are ramping up to deliver CALEA-like wiretapping services for the Internet indicates the FBI sees the power of CALEA growing beyond phone lines to the web. And Georgiades pointed out that foreign governments are under no such constraints and can use Internet snooping equipment under existing current wiretapping laws.
David Banisar, Research Fellow at Harvard's Information Infrastructure Project, said such systems "set a dangerous precedent to allow law enforcement and intelligence agencies to run the communications system." He added, "these agencies take an over-inclusive view of who they think are the enemies and its likely that civil and human rights groups will, again, be monitored for no legitimate reason."
The large defense and intelligence consulting and engineering firm Booz, Allen & Hamilton has not only developed the FBI's Carnivore capability but it has assisted the bureau in ensuring that all telecommunications companies engineer their systems to ensure they are "wiretap friendly." The companies are required by the Communications Assistance to Law Enforcement Act to ensure the FBI has access to all forms of telecommunications, including cellular What if a target decides to use encryption to protect their e-mail from interception? That is not a problem for the FBI. Booz Allen & Hamilton has helped develop a system code-named Magic Lantern, which permits a virus containing a key logging program to be secretly transmitted to a recipient. After installing itself on the target's computer, any time the target types in a password to decrypt a message, that same password is immediately picked up by Magic Lantern and transmitted to the FBI. Essentially, the FBI has a virtual master key to break any encryption program used by a surveillance target.
A companion program to Magic Lantern, code named Cyber Knight, is a relational database system that compares and matches information from e-mail, Internet relay chats, instant messages, and Internet voice Not to be outdone by the FBI, the CIA has also been extremely active in developing software than can dig deep within the Internet to harvest information. The CIA has relied heavily on its wholly-owned and operated proprietary Silicon Valley company, IN-Q-TEL, to fund research and development for Internet snooping software. IN-Q-TEL's President and Chief Executive Officer Gilman Louie is to keynote a January 2002 Las Vegas seminar on the use of emerging intelligence technology to search and analyze the web. He is to be joined by Joan Dempsey, the Deputy Director of the CIA for Intelligence Community Management. IN-Q-TEL's web page describes the aggressive attitude the CIA is taking toward ensuring new technologies come complete with the spy agency's seal of approval, "IN-Q-TEL strives to extend the Agency's access to new IT companies, solutions, and approaches to address their priority problems."
Assisting the government in its goals to gather massive amounts of personal information on citizens and non-citizens, is a company that owes its very existence to the CIA. Oracle, Inc. Chairman Larry Ellison has offered to provide to the government free of charge the database software required to establish an interactive national ID card system. Oracle got its start when the CIA gave Ellison a contract in the 1970s to design a system to enable the agency to store and retrieve massive amounts if information in databases. Not coincidentally, the code name of that CIA project was "Oracle."
The rush by the government to monitor the Internet has the backing of a group of federal contract research facilities that have pounded out report after report warning about the threat of cyberspace to national security. These "think tanks" include Rand Corporation and Analytical Services Corporation (ANSER). They are assisted in this policy laundering effort by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the K Street rest home for former Pentagon, intelligence, and State Department political appointees.
But all the technology in the world will not protect citizens from terrorist attacks, unless the government knows how to use the information effectively. As the government and a few selected companies and think tanks push for new surveillance laws and more monitoring of the Internet and telecommunications in general, the words of Mary Schiavo, the Transportation Department's former Inspector General and outspoken critic of lax airline security, are particularly poignant. Speaking in Washington on December 18, Schiavo pointed out that the "United States already had laws to prevent what happened on September 11th . . . they weren't being enforced."

Finally, A Solution To The DMCA!
August 23, 2001
For years, the geek community has been at the wrong end of
the War on Piracy waged by Hollywood lawyers.  The
situation could change, however, with the unveiling of a
secret weapon -- "The First Church Of Digital Grepping".
This newly created church argues that copying digital
information is a form of religious worship.  As such, it's
protected in the US by the freedom of religion clause in
the First Amendment.
"Rock beats scissors.  And Free Exercise of Religion beats
Digital Millennium Copyright Act(tm).  Ha ha, suckers!"
said the church's High Priest.
Chapter 16, Verse 256 of the Sacred Readme of the First
Church Of Digital Grepping  states:
   On the first day, the Great Programmer created a new
   text file and the Universe was born.
   The Great Programmer flexed his fingers, started
   hacking, and entered Deep Hack Mode.
   First He wrote universe.c.  Then sys/laws_of_physics.h
   and universal_constants.h.  The Great Programmer
   continued his Hacking Binge into the second day  with
   sol.c, which begat terra.c, which begat land_and_sea.c,
   which laid the foundation for the creation of life.c.
   On the third day, He gazed upon his Program and saw that
   it was good.  More he produced: prokaryotes.c,
   eukaryotes.c, sys/dna.h, invertebrates.c, vertebrates.c.
   On the fourth day, the Great Programmer, against his
   better judgement,  coded mankind.c.
   On the fifth day, He compiled his work, and received
   1,024 errors.
   On the sixth day, He debugged.
   On the seventh day, He continued to debug.  Rest is for
   the weak.
   On the eight day, the debugging continued.  Only 128
   compiler warnings did He now receive.
   On the ninth day, the program compiled correctly.  Upon
   execution, it immediately coredumped.
   On the tenth day, The Great Programmer debugged.
   On the eleventh day, He debugged.
   On the twelfth day, He waved a dead chicken, but the
   Great Program continued to segfault.
   On the thirteenth day, He discovered the fatal flaw, a
   misplaced comma He did find.  And then void main()
   executed, and the Big Bang did occur.
   Then the Great Programmer leaned back in his executive
   chair, and gazed upon the newborn Universe.
   And frowned.  He knew those sentient humans would be a
   problem. Even after He had sweated over a hot terminal
   for thirteen days, those humans were ungrateful.  They
   called their place of existence the "Universe", not the
   "Great Programmer/Universe".
   On the fourteenth day, he decided to take action.  He
   would send these humans The Meaning Of Life, and soon
   the world would worship Him and his Hacking Skills.
   He did just that.  He inspired a certain human to
   produce a work of art which includes His message, The
   Meaning Of Life.  Eventually the humans would discover
   the .plan of the Great Programmer hidden in a certain
   work of art and all would be well...
The Sacred Readme is a tad vague, but the church's High
Priest believes that "The Meaning Of Life" is encoded in
either a popular song, or a Hollywood movie, or an Adobe
"If only we could figure out which 'work of art' the Sacred
Readme refers to, and then grep through the binary
representation to extract the divine message," the High
Priest explains.
The mission of the church is to make digital copies of
every music CD, every movie DVD, and every printed book and
then grep the digital version for any tell-tale signs of
'The Meaning Of Life'."
"Our church cannot function if the DMCA prohibits us from
making copies as part of the Fair Use Doctrine.  We worship
the Great Programmer by trying to discover His secret
message.  Why should we put the profits of Big Evil
Corporations above the search for The Meaning Of Life?"
Of course, the MPAA, RIAA, DVD-CCA, BSA, and other groups
see things slightly differently.
"This is all bull," said a MPAA spokesperson.  "We didn't
buy a slate of Congressmen to get the DMCA passed just so
some fake parody religion could claim a bogus exemption!"
An investigator for Oracle discovered a hand-written copy
of the Sacred Readme while rummaging through the High
Priest's trash cans.  The P.I. believes that the holy
document was actually written last Wednesday when the High
Priest had a little too much to drink.
The founder of the church stands his ground, however.  "I
wasn't drunk last Wednesday," he argues, "I was busy trying
to find the divine message within a copy of 'Star Trek
XXIII: We Promise This Movie Doesn't Include Any Annoying
Characters Like Jar Jar Binks' on my big-screen projection
TV.  Needless to say, I came up empty."
The judges in the California Sixth District Court of
Appeals were all unavailable for comment at press time.

Lawmaker Wants Magic Lantern Information From FBI
By Robert MacMillan, Newsbytes
WASHINGTON, D.C., U.S.A.,
14 Jan 2002, 7:27 PM CST
Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, in a letter last week told the FBI that he is
concerned about the bureau's refusal to provide information about the
existence of a computer and e-mail surveillance plan dubbed "Magic Lantern."
In the letter, provided to the Politech mailing list by Paul's legislative
director Norman Singleton, the Congressman asked FBI Director Robert Mueller
to hand over information on the keystroke monitoring program, "or provide me
with written justification for the FBI's refusal to share information on
this crucial issue."
Paul asked for a response within two weeks.
"If ... media reports are accurate, the Magic Lantern project could greatly
impact the privacy and civil liberties of all Americans who communicate via
e-mail," Paul said. "Recently, my legislative director attempted to obtain
information on this project from the FBI and was told such information was
classified. Considering the potential impact of Magic Lantern, I am sure you
can understand why I was disturbed by this refusal."
Media reports have said that the FBI could distribute Magic Lantern the same
way worms thread through the Internet, which would eliminate the need for
law enforcement to physically install monitoring programs on suspect's
Privacy advocates are concerned that a program such as Magic Lantern could
help the FBI circumvent the normal process of subjecting to a court's
oversight when using surveillance tools.
FBI officials had no immediate comment on the letter.

Bring in the geeks
   By Declan McCullagh
   July 15, 2002, 4:00 AM PT
   WASHINGTON--Gigi Sohn hopes that geeks have become so enraged by
   recent anti-piracy schemes that they'll finally want to fight back.
   The 40-year old lawyer, head of the Public Knowledge nonprofit group
   here, plans to recruit a ragtag band of technophiles and train them to
   become a corps of effective political activists on the Internet front.
   To Sohn, this means seizing on widespread discontent created by the
   attempts of Hollywood and the music labels to curtail file-swapping
   networks while promoting sweeping new anti-copying laws and standards.
   E-mail campaigns are easily ignored, and transforming online ire into
   effective political action is hardly a trivial task.
   Geek armies have always been eager to vent in online forums and clog
   the e-mail inboxes of errant congressional types. As far back as 1995,
   over 50,000 peeved Netizens signed an electronic petition slamming the

Put a Z in ISONews
By Ashlee Vance in San Francisco
Posted: 09/04/2003 at 23:23 GMT
The people behind ISONEWs are mulling legal action to fight the "illegal
and abusive" seizure of the domain by the US Department of Justice.
The DoJ seized the URL, but not - it turns out- the site, in February,
with the intention of turning it from what was a bible for the discerning
software copier into a repository of anti-piracy propaganda.
ISONews quickly returned to the Internet with the slightest of
modification to its URL at IzoNews.com.
The new domain has a pop-up that explains the shift and surrounding legal
battle, which is printed in full below:
Dear Isonews user,
As you know, the ISONEWS.COM domain was recently seized by the US
Government in accordance with a court case against former owner David
Rocci. A few months prior to the seizure, the domain was sold to a third
party located outside of the USA, and has since been under the control of
new ownewship, which makes the seizure of the domain illegal and abusive.
At the present time, we are in contact with our lawyers to see what our
legal options may be. We are fully aware of the fact that taking legal
action will be very expensive and time consuming.
For the moment we have decided to temporarily move the website to a new
domain, so that all users can remain in contact and we may continue
building a strong website for future users to distribute information
freely. IZONEWS.COM will be the new location of the website, where you
will find the same forums and information as before.
Please help us win this battle against Goliath and spread the word on our
domain name!
Thanks for sticking with us, and Long live the freedom of information!
The IZONEWS Team
A note on the original ISONews domain makes it quite clear that the
address belongs to the U.S. government. The Feds seized the domain, when
David Rocci, 22, pleaded guilty to "conspiring to import, market and sell
circumvention devices known as modification (or "mod") chips in violation
of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act".
Rocci was sentenced to five months in prison, five months of home
detention, three years of probation and a $28,500 fine. .

By John Borland
Staff Writer, CNET News.com
April 14, 2003
A pair of students were blocked by a federal court from presenting
information at a Georgia security and hackers' conference on how to break
into and modify a university electronic transactions system.
Washington D.C.-based education software company Blackboard successfully
convinced a Georgia state court to block the students' presentation, which
was scheduled to be given at the Interz0ne conference in Atlanta last
Blackboard argues that the restraining order blocked the publication of
information gained illegally, which would have harmed the company's
commercial interests and those of its clients. But conference organizers
contend that the students' free speech rights were abridged.
"The temporary restraining order pointed out that the irreparable injury
to Blackboard, our intellectual property rights and clients far outweighed
the commercial speech rights of the individuals in question," said Michael
Stanton, a Blackboard spokesman.
The company claims that the speech being blocked is commercial speech
because the students were a "small competitor" to Blackboard. One of the
students, Georgia Institute of Technology's Billy Hoffman, had threatened
to give away code allowing any computer to emulate Blackboard's
technology, the company claims.
Programmers' rights to publish or present information that would help
break security technology has been an increasingly controversial issue
over the past few years.
Much of the controversy has focused on the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act, which contains a provision making it illegal to break technological
security measures protecting copyrighted works, or even to publish
information explaining how to do so.
The best-known case in this area had to do with Princeton University
professor Edward Felton's attempts to present information on how to break
protections created by the now-defunct Secure Digital Music Initiative.
Felton said that SDMI attorneys told him he would be violating copyright
law if he presented his work. The Recording Industry Association of
America (RIAA), a key part of the SDMI effort, denied making legal
Although an initial cease and desist letter sent to the Interz0ne
conference organizers hinted that the students may have violated the DMCA,
the complaint that resulted in the temporary restraining order did not
touch on that copyright law.
Instead, the restraining order was grounded largely in federal and Georgia
state antihacking laws and a state trade secrets act.
The information set to be presented was gleaned after one of the students
had physically broken into a network and switching device on his campus
and subsequently figured out a way to mimic Blackboard's technology, the
company told the judge. Because that alleged act would be illegal under
the federal and state laws, publication of the resulting information
should be blocked, it argued.
The state judge agreed, at least temporarily. A hearing on a permanent
injunction against publication or presentation of the work will be held in
Georgia state court Wednesday.
The students, Hoffman and the University of Alabama's Virgil Griffith,
could not immediately be reached for comment.

White House seeks to expand DNA database
By Richard Willing, USA TODAY
4/15/2003 7:36 PM
WASHINGTON  DNA profiles from juvenile offenders and from adults who have
been arrested but not convicted would be added to the FBI's national DNA
database under a Bush administration proposal.
Under current law, only DNA from adults convicted of crimes can be placed in
the national database, which is used to compare those samples with biological
evidence from the scenes of unsolved crimes. As of January, there were about
1.3 million DNA samples in the database, U.S. officials say.
Adding profiles from thousands of adult arrestees and juvenile offenders would
greatly expand the DNA system's worth by increasing the number of potential
matches, administration officials say. Justice Department officials have
discussed potential changes in federal DNA law with key members of Congress and
are pushing for legislation this year.
"DNA is to the 21st century what fingerprinting was to the 20th," says Deborah
Daniels, assistant U.S. attorney general for justice programs. "The widespread
use of DNA evidence is the future of law enforcement in this country."
But critics say adding juvenile and arrestee profiles to the database threatens
privacy by expanding the pool of samples beyond adult criminals. Although only
digital DNA profiles would be linked to the FBI computer, the blood or saliva
samples from which the DNA was drawn would be kept by state labs, they note.
"It's only a matter of time before the government gets its hands on those
DNA samples and starts playing around with our genetic codes," says Barry
Steinhardt, privacy specialist for the American Civil Liberties Union's
national office in New York City. "They say they don't want to do that, but
not too long ago they were saying they'd only take DNA profiles from rapists
and murderers and now they want juveniles ... We're not just on a slippery
slope, we're halfway down it."
DNA system defenders say the actual samples must be retained for quality-
control testing and in the event a DNA match is challenged in court. They note
that strict privacy laws prevent researchers from using the stored samples for
any other purpose. And they note that the U.S. government already stores
fingerprints from arrestees in a giant computer system without causing privacy
Privacy advocates aren't convinced. They note that researchers are identifying
genetic markers for height, hair color and other features. They suspect that
authorities soon will want to search DNA samples for such genetic markers.
DNA, a cellular acid contained in blood, semen and other body fluids and
tissues, is an ideal tool for crime solving. Because it contains an individual's
unique genetic code, a DNA sample taken from blood, semen or even traces of
saliva in a bite mark left on a crime victim can be used to match the
perpetrator to the crime.
In 1989, states began to collect DNA from convicted criminals and add the
profiles to a computer that could match them to DNA from unsolved crimes. In
1992, the FBI created a system that linked the state databases via a bureau
computer in Morgantown, W.Va.
Thirty states already collect DNA profiles from juvenile offenders, who
typically range in age from 13 to 17 but can be as young as 8, according to the
Coalition for Juvenile Justice, a Washington, D.C., advocacy group. Since
January, Virginia also has collected DNA from those accused of murder, rape and
other violent felonies. But under U.S. law, only DNA from people convicted of
crimes can be put into the FBI system.
The national DNA database has had many successes. As of December, 6,670 DNA
samples had been matched to unsolved crimes, the FBI says.
States that take DNA from the widest range of offenders seem to produce the
best results. New York has had 830 matches since it began to collect DNA from
violent felons in 1996. But 80% were made after 1999, when the state began to
require DNA collection from most other felonies.
In Virginia, DNA from 74 crimes, including 12 rapes and nine murders, has been
matched to DNA profiles from juvenile offenders during the past 10 years.
"Not all juveniles are going to become adult criminals," says Paul Ferrara,
director of Virginia's DNA program. "But for the few who are, the sooner we
have them in the system the better."
It is unclear how many new DNA samples would be put into the system if juvenile
offenders and adult arrestees are added. In 1996, the last year for which data
are available, 567,200 youths were found responsible for crimes by juvenile
courts or other authorities. Virginia expects to collect DNA from 8,000
arrestees this year.
The White House is pushing to make DNA a more effective law enforcement tool.
Last month, it announced a plan to spend about $1 billion over five years to
improve the national database.

Privilege Revoked
The government says it can pry into the attorney-client relationship all it
by Geov Parrish
Lynne Stewart, a New York human-rights lawyer with a taste for radical
politics, is accustomed to representing unpopular clients.
She never dreamed it would become illegal.
Stewart was in Seattle on Monday as part of a national campaign to drum up
support-not for a client, but for her own case. Stewart was a member of the
court-appointed defense team for Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, who is serving a
life sentence in connection with the first World Trade Center bombing in
1993. After his conviction, Stewart continued as one of the lawyers
representing Abdel Rahman. The Seattle visit came just over a year after her
arrest April 8, 2002, when she was taken from her home without warning.
Federal agents combed through her office, seizing files on all of her cases,
and Attorney General John Ashcroft proudly announced that Stewart had been
charged in a four-count criminal indictment with aiding and abetting a
terrorist organization-solely for her work in representing Abdel Rahman.
Stewart's case, now winding its way through pretrial motions toward a
January trial, stands as a critical test for the Bush administration's newly
reserved right to violate lawyer-client confidentiality in order to wage the
war on terror. It also has a significant First Amendment component.
Stewart's indictment charges her with discussing Abdel Rahman's case with a
Reuters reporter-even though no gag order barred her from doing so; with
talking while an interpreter was speaking with her client during a
consultation in his prison cell, thereby preventing the Justice Department
from taping their conversation in Arabic; and with allowing the interpreter
and client to speak in Arabic about nonlegal matters. If convicted, she
faces 40 years in prison.
THE CHARGES STRIKE at the heart of the U.S. Constitution's Sixth Amendment
guarantee that all people accused of a crime are entitled to effective
representation by an attorney. Courts have long held that attorney-client
confidentiality is essential to that right; without the ability to speak
freely about what they have, and have not, done, defendants are severely
impaired from learning their legal status and options, and attorneys cannot
mount the best defense. But Stewart's case has broader implications. In the
future, attorneys will be less willing to represent clients like Abdel
And since Stewart's indictment, Ashcroft has gone even further, declaring
noncitizens, and later, U.S. citizens as well, "enemy noncombatants" so as
to hold them indefinitely without charges, denying access to any attorney at
Whether or not the "enemy noncombatant" ruse is eventually ruled
unconstitutional, Stewart's case risks setting a precedent that could
literally destroy an accused terrorist's right to counsel-while allowing the
government to choose who qualifies as a "terrorist." Even before 9/11,
several federal provisions allowed investigators to violate attorney-client
privilege: when the state had reason to believe the attorney and client were
complicit in criminal behavior; as a court-approved part of international
espionage; or if a court barred incarcerated clients from communicating with
the outside world, including their attorneys, about nonlegal matters.
BUT ASHCROFT'S provisions, announced and implemented without public notice
or comment less than three weeks after 9/11, are far broader-allowing the
monitoring of attorney-client conversations without a court order or
supervision or even the suspicion of criminal behavior by the attorney, if
the client is accused of terrorism. The regulation allows surveillance "to
the extent determined to be reasonably necessary for the purpose of
deterring future acts of violence or terrorism." The Department of Justice
alone does the determining.
Among other things, such monitoring allows the government complete access to
everything the defense knows and every strategy the defense plans. It raises
the possibility that attorneys could be called to testify against their
clients or that attorneys could be charged for withholding information on a
crime from investigators. Attorneys' personal jeopardy creates an impossible
conflict of interest with their professional duty to fully represent their
clients. The government, at its leisure, can target lawyers-ones like
Stewart, with a long history of representing unpopular clients, or like the
lead attorney in Stewart's defense, Michael Tigar, famed for saving Oklahoma
City bomber Terry Nichols from execution. And Ashcroft's regulation, if
upheld, sets a precedent that state and local jurisdictions can rush to
Lynne Stewart is a guinea pig-a chance for the Bush administration to see
how far it can push its evisceration of the Bill of Rights. The attack on
attorney representation is only one of a staggering number of its post-9/11
assaults on the Constitution, but it's one of the most important.
Invariably, the least sympathetic among us-the accused terrorists and the
radical lawyers-are the first to lose basic rights.
The rest of us follow.

More Evidence The Vote Was Rigged
I don't want rain on the parade but I am getting quite a few emails from various sources citing possible irregularities with the voting process. So, I did a little research myself on the net to see what I could find. As a political scientist I could not resist.
Regardless of the veracity of any claim to possible irregularities I suggest that this question of legitimacy of the process needs to be addressed if everyone casting their vote is to feel that their vote is being properly counted. No one can feel disenfranchised in a real democracy. Otherwise, you end up with a dictatorship and not a democracy at all.
Unless BOTH sides feel the system is verifiable then you may end up with a banana republic 'democracy'. This is not question of who won the election. It is a matter of much greater importance; the legitimacy of the democratic process itself.
Here are a couple of sites which address the issue:
1. 2. On this last web site I found this interesting bit of information:
"Various people sent me mail saying that it is awfully fishy that the exit polls and final results were substantially different in some places. I hope someone will follow this up and actually do a careful analysis. Does anyone know of a Website containing all the exit poll data? If we go to computerized voting without a paper trail and the machines can be set up to cheat, that is the end of our democracy. Switching 5 votes per machine is probably all it would take to throw an election and nobody would ever see it unless someone compares the computer totals and exit polls. I am still very concerned about the remark of Walden O'Dell a Republican fund raiser and CEO of Diebold, which makes voting machines saying he would deliver Ohio for President Bush. Someone (not me) should look into this carefully. The major newspapers actually recounted all the votes in Florida last time. Maybe this year's project should be looking at the exit polls. If there are descrepancies between the exit polls and the final results in touch-screen counties but not in paper-ballot counties, that would be a signal. At the very least it could be a good masters thesis for a political science student. The Open voting consortium is a group addressing the subject of verifiable voting."
Could there be a possible problem here? Let's see...
* In states where there were paper ballots the results exactly matched the exit polls.
* In states where there were only electronic 'touch-screen' paperless voting machines Bush showed an inexplicable 5-8 point or more difference from the polls, contradicting otherwise accurate exit polls.
* The software used in these voting machines is so sophisticated that you can't even check out the programming because it disappears leaving nothing to verify, no source code, no nothing.
Below are 3 articles explaining how these E-voting programs work. The man who published these articles is apparently an expert on this E-voting subject and a computer scientist.
Article 1  articles/04.0303.ADeafeningSilence_article.htm Article 2  articles/04.0618.SecretAgentPrograms_article.htm Article 3  Another site takes the subject seriously...
* SoCalDem has done a statistical analysis... ...on several swing states, and EVERY STATE that has EVoting but no paper trails has an unexplained advantage for Bush of around +5% when comparing exit polls to actual results.
* In EVERY STATE that has paper audit trails on their EVoting, the exit poll results match the actual results reported within the margin of error.
* Analysis of the polling data vs actual data and voting systems supports the hypothesis that evoting may be to blame in the discrepancies.
* The media was a bit taken aback that the results didn't match the exit polls AT ALL. Most of the commentators were scratching their head in disbelief at the results. The media has gracefully claimed they "just got it wrong."
Some examples?
Kerry leads Female voters by 7%, Bush leads male voters by 7%. Male vs. Female voter turnout is 47% M, 53% F. That means Kerry statistically has a 7% edge in exit polling in Wisconsin.
Actual results however show Bush ahead by 1%, an unexplained difference of 8%.
Kerry leads in the exit polls by a clear margin, but is still behind in the reported results. This state is even closer.
Actual is just 1% favor of Bush. Exit polls show Kerry with a wider margin. Women favored Kerry by 8% here out of 52% of total voters. Men favored Bush by just 6% out of 48% of total voters. Actual reported results don't match exit polling AT ALL in Nevada.
Easy Programming?
According to the programmer cited above here is how easy it is to "make magic" We need COUNTERS - (B) = Bush; (K) = Kerry; (V) = Vote; (T) =Tally
1. If V = B, add 1 to B
2. If T = 8, add 1 to B; Clear T; Skip 3
3. If V = K, add 1 to K; Add 1 to T
This extremely simple bit of programming would shift 12% of the vote from Kerry to Bush, it would defy exit polls, and it would make it look like Bush had a huge popular win.
Feel free to pass this on to your Republican and Democratic friends. If you are American, this should concern you regardless of who won this election or wins future elections. If your process is flawed your democracy is flawed and everything you believe in is on the line. I am sure that people on the ground are acting in good faith and voting according to their values and beliefs. It is the people at the top that concern me.

     This is an interesting time for electronic voting. India,
     the largest democracy in the world, went completely paper-
     free for its general elections earlier this year. For the
     first time, some 387 million people expressed their
     electoral right electronically. Despite initial concerns
     about security and correctness of the system, the election
     process was a smashing success. Over a million electronic
     voting machines (EVMs) were deployed, 8000 metric tonnes of
     paper saved[1] and the results made public within few hours
     of the final vote. Given the quarrelsome and heavily
     litigated nature of Indian democracy, a lot of us were
     expecting post-election drama, but only a few, if any,
     fingers were found pointing.
     Things didn't fare so well in the United States. The
     Dieobold electronic machines, slated for use in many states
     for the November 2004 Federal elections, turned out to have
     rather large security holes. Cryptography experts, Avi Rubin
     et al, did a formal analysis of the machines and found that
     they could be subverted to introduce votes that were never
     casted[2]. An independent government-backed analysis
     confirmed this[3] and concluded that the Diebold voting
     system "as implemented in policy, procedure, and technology,
     is at a high risk of compromise."
     It is clear, even to a cursory observer, that Diebold
     systems are sloppily designed, never mind the sloppiness is
     a function of incompetence or intent. The recent controversy
     from the "Black Box Voting" security advisory titled "the
     Diebold GEMS central tabulator contains a stunning security
     hole"[4] has added to the confusion. It claims that a code
     entered at a remote location can replace the real vote count
     with a fabricated one. This security hole, discovered last
     year, is still not fixed says the advisory. In response,
     Diebold claims that this is possible, but only in debug
     mode, which does little to make people confortable.
     What is disturbing to me as a technologist is the
     burgeoning public opinion that electronics is an unviable
     medium for conducting the serious business of elections.
     Over the last year I've seen numerous formal reports and
     articles in popular press[5] equating the failures of
     Diebold systems with the untenability of electronic voting.
     This is rather silly. Diebold systems are not only poorly
     engineered, they are also seriously flawed in design. Even
     if they were immaculately bug-free, they are so far from
     what electronic voting systems should be, that I have
     trouble categorizing them as "voting systems". "Electronic
     counters" is more accurate.
     Various augmentations have been proposed to Diebold systems;
     most revolve around parallel paper trails. Verified
     Voting[6] for example proposes that a vote be printed based
     on the voter's touch-screen selection, so the voter can
     touch, feel and verify their vote before casting it into a
     traditional ballet box. These votes would then be processed
     with an OCR type machine to compute a cumulative result and
     the physical votes would be saved so an independent party
     can verify the electronic result at a latter date. This is a
     reasonable tradeoff -- after all integrity of elections is
     way more important than saving trees and time.
     While this is the best recommendation for the upcoming
     elections, it subtly promotes the primacy of paper and
     distrust in electrons. We know that paper elections are no
     more secure. The history of vote tampering in paper based
     elections is quite illustrious (I'll simply refer the gentle
     reader to [7]) and the reason electronics was considered in
     the first place was to eliminate such tampering. Verified
     Voting recommends that count of the physical votes is to be
     considered superior than that of the electronic counterparts
     in case of a difference. What happens if the process of this
     count is tampered using traditional methods? We are back to
     square one.
     The central point that I want to get across in this paper is
     that the promise of electronic voting is not merely a
     quicker, slightly more secure and ecologically enlightened
     replacement for paper elections. Electronic voting, if
     implemented correctly, could be a major qualitative leap,
     not only changing the way in which we approach democratic
     elections, but also the the way in which we expect a
     democratic government to function.
     Cryptographic Integrity
     I want to draw attention to the work done by cryptographic
     community in the last 20 years to study, formalize and solve
     many of the problems of Internet Voting. This area of work
     is focused on building election systems that leave behind a
     trail of mathematical proofs of the integrity of the voting
     process. With mathematical solutions to the common issues of
     vote tampering, it becomes unnecessary to trust election
     officials and it becomes possible to build voting systems
     that are open and universally verifiable.
     A voting system for appointing a democratic government has
     certain "ideal properties". These are rather obvious, but I
     recount them for the purpose of this discussion. First, all
     votes must be counted exactly like they were casted.
     Altering a vote, or leaving one out from the final tally
     must be impossible. Ballot stuffing, ie. artificial
     injection of invalid votes must be impossible as well. The
     system should reject non-eligible voters, and ensure
     eligible users can cast only a single vote. And, finally,
     votes must be absolutely anonymous -- even the voter should
     be unable to prove the way in which they voted. Systems like
     Diebold's depend on large-scale observation to uphold the
     ideal properties. Large-scale observation is hard, and once
     an act of tampering is done, there is little that can be
     done to detect or correct it. The attacks such as the one
     described by the Black Box Voting advisory are particularly
     heinous, since they compromise the entire election process.
     The ideal properties are true in paper elections when they
     are implemented perfectly, but the nature of paper precludes
     proofs of correctness without compromising anonymity. The
     problems are much the same as in the "Electronic Counter"
     systems; without correctness proofs, it is largely
     infeasible to detect and correct tampering.
     Cryptographers have been trying to emulate the property of
     anonymity that is inherent to paper when it us used as cash
     or votes. The research in the field has led to invention of
     several mathematical primitives and computing systems that
     not only model paper but go beyond to provide proofs of the
     properties they emulate. Techniques like blind signatures,
     homomorphic encryption, digital mixes and onion routing have
     been used to build systems that provide strong anonymity.
     The pioneering cryptographer David Chaum introduced the
     blind signature in order to build permit truly anonymous
     interaction on the Internet[8]. Since then, they have been
     applied to all manner of problems from untraceable
     electronic cash to electronic voting schemes. Blind
     signatures are a class of digital signatures that allow a
     document to be signed without revealing its contents. The
     effect is similar to placing a document and a sheet of
     carbon paper inside an envelope. When the envelope is
     signed, the signature transfers to the document and remains
     on it even when the envelope is removed.
     In his paper, Chaum hinted that blind signatures could be
     used for secret ballot elections. Fujioka, Okamoto, and
     Ohta[9] created the first significant blind signature based
     voting protocol, which made it practical to use blind
     signatures in democratic elections. However, some problems
     were discovered in their work, most notably the system's
     vulnerablity to a corrupt election authority. I present a
     system, dubbed ``Athens'', that builds on their work, but
     solves several problems in their model. I also focus on a
     real-world election system, rather than an Internet one, and
     adopt a pragmatic approach, in that I make use of physical
     resources like volunteers and physical infrastructure
     usually available for large-scale democratic elections.
     Athens also borrows elements and thinking from the
     Sensus[10] system and David Chaum's recent work on Visual
     Cryptography[11].
     Design of Athens
     The basic procedure for conducting a democratic election is
     fairly standard. The procedure has four tasks: Registration,
     Validation, Collection and Tallying. In Athens, these four
     tasks are carried out with a few specialized machines and
     software, most of which are connected through the Internet.
     While Athens employs an Election Authority to oversee the
     process of elections, it does away with the dependence on
     trustworthiness of one. Athens philosophy is that there are
     no truly non-partisan parties; even the Election Authority
     can't be completely trusted. The Athens model is closer to a
     "game" between contesting parties, such that the only way to
     cheat in the game is for all competitors to collude - an
     axiomatic impossibility. The Election Authority performs
     tactical tasks to optimize the election process, but all
     tasks performed by the Authority are open to review by
     competing parties.
     Registration
     Registration is the process of determining eligible voters,
     and is conducted by the "Registrar" -- a distributed
     authority put in place by the Election Authority. The Athens
     registration process involves validating voters (through
     traditional means) and registering their "Voter Public Key"
     in the "Register." The corresponding "Voter Secret Key"
     remains with the voter, magnetically encoded (or bar coded
     for cheaper implementation) on a "Voting Card".
     The keys are generated through the "Voting Card Creator
     Machine". The Card Creator Machine is also implemented as
     software that can be used by a voter on their home computer.
     It is not hard to imagine Card Creators installed in local
     registration offices or even at Kinko's and shopping malls,
     where they charge a few dollars for generating a card.
     Fairness in design is important, because Card Creators could
     compromise the security of the system by storing the key
     pairs they generate.
     A card creator is mostly an RSA key generator - it needs
     computing power of a 300 Mhz PC, and is constructed fairly
     cheaply. Once the voter enters their personal information
     into the machine, it spits out two cards: one with the
     public key, that is handed over to the Registrar and the
     other with the secret key and identification information
     required by the Election Authority (like the social security
     number of the voter.) The second card is known as the
     "Voting Card" and is used to validate the voter at the time
     of elections. Both cards also contain a large random number,
     known as the Voter Id. This is used throughout the voting
     process to facilitate lookups in the Register without
     compromising the privacy of the voter.
     Once all voters have handed their Voter Public Key Card over
     to the Registrar, the registration process is considered to
     be complete. As with traditional elections, there is a cut-
     off date for this process.
     On completion of registration, the Election Authority hands
     the Register over to all the competitors. The competitors
     then check every 1 in 1000 entries (or more according to
     their capacity) to ensure that they belong to a legitimate
     voter, i.e. it isn't a fake entry inserted by a corrupt
     competitor to stuff the ballot. This process is woefully
     lacking in elections of today, and a hence a major vector
     for election fraud. Mathematics can do little to alleviate
     the dangers of registering fake voters, but competitors who
     depend on the correctness of the Register and raise funds
     for the purpose can easily perform this task. Register
     verification would be a lucrative business for independent
     professional services organizations, so it is not hard to
     imagine such organizations sprouting up to assume delegation
     of this responsibility.
     The competitors also put the Register on the Internet before
     the election so that voters can ensure their voter key is
     present in all copies of the Register. When requested, each
     competing party provides a digitally signed proof that the
     voter is registered to vote, i.e. their key is present in
     the Register. The voter, if denied the right to vote, can
     take this proof to a court of law. A pre-voting verification
     of eligibility limits the kind of fiasco that occurred in
     Florida during the Presidential elections of 2000, where a
     large number of people were denied vote.
     Validation
     In most electronic voting protocols, there exists the notion
     of the "Validator" - a party that holds the Register and
     validates voters during the election. In Athens, the
     competing parties, that were handed a copy of the Register
     in the previous step, all serve as Validators. Athens,
     therefore, is a multi-validator system. It is reasonable to
     assume that independents or fiscally constrained parties
     would team up and have a single Validator represent them.
     Validators are connected to the Internet and run Validation
     software, that accepts validation requests over a TCP port.
     The Validators are firewall'ed off to accept data only from
     certain IP addresses. The Electronic Voting Machines talk to
     the Validators via a Proxy. EVMs could theoretically talk
     directly to Validators, but the reasons for using a proxy
     will become apparent later. The Proxy is operated by the
     Election Authority and observed by representatives from all
     competing parties.
     Validators have their own RSA key pair, the public portion
     of which is published widely over the Internet. They also
     maintain two lists (other than the Register). This is the
     list of voters who have casted a vote and a list of
     corresponding validation requests.
     Before the commencement of the election, the Election
     Authority chooses a a random number which is known as the
     "Election Number". The only property of this number is its
     uniqueness to the election - it should not have been used in
     a previous election. The Election Number is distributed to
     all Validators.
     Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) used in Athens are quite
     unlike Diebold's or the ones used in the Indian elections.
     Athens' EVMs are simply "agents" that vote on behalf of the
     voter. Each EVM has an Id and a RSA key pair. The public
     part of the EVM key is published widely over the Internet.
     Communications initiated by the EVM are signed with EVMs
     secret key. The elections are considered formally commenced,
     when the Validators broadcast the Election Number and their
     public keys to EVMs via the Proxy.
     The Athens Voting Protocol
     The voter enters a private booth and swipes their Voting
     Card on the EVM. The EVM reads the secret key and the Voter
     Id off the Card. The EVM has a little printer attached to
     it, much like a cash register receipt printer, on which it
     prints out the Voter Id. It the sends the voter Id off to
     the Validators via the proxy to initiate a "voting session"
     on behalf of the voter. If the voter has already casted a
     vote, Validators return a "proof" of previously casted vote.
     The proof and its implications are discussed a little later.
     If there's no previous vote, the Validators send a positive
     acknowledgment and the EVM asks the voter to cast a ballot.
     The voter enters their vote using the on-screen display. The
     EVM concatenates the Voter's choice with the Election Number
     (EN) and the result is encrypted with a secret key (randomly
     generated) using a symmetric cipher like AES. The encrypted
     ballot is then blinded. At this point, the EVM has:
             Voter Id +
             Blind(Encrypted(Ballot . EN))
     The blinded ballot is then signed with the voter's secret
     key. The EVM also signs the EN with the Voter's key. The
     EVM now has:
             Voter Id +
             VoterSignature(EN) +
             VoterSignature(Blind(Encrypted(Ballot . EN))) +
             Blind(Encrypted(Ballot . EN))
     The EVM sends the signed, blinded ballot over to the the
     Proxy, that sends it to all Validators. Upon receipt, a
     Validator looks up the public key corresponding to the Voter
     Id and uses it to check the voter signature. If the voter
     signature is valid the Validator signs the blind with its
     own key. It adds the Voter Id to the list of voters who have
     casted a vote and keeps, in another list, the original
     blinded request, the signed EN, and the timestamp of request
     as a proof of the casted vote. It sends the signed blinded
     ballot back to the Proxy, that forwards it to the
     originating EVM. The data packet contains:
         EVM Id +
         Voter Id +
         ValidatorSignature(Blind(Encrypted(Ballot . EN)))
     If the Validator can't validate the signature, it sends a
     VERIFY_FAILURE error to the EVM:
         EVM Id +
         Voter Id +
         VERIFY_FAILURE +
         ValidatorSignature(
             VERIFY_FAILURE +
             Blind(Encrypted(Ballot . EN))
         )
     If the Validator can't find the Voter Id, it sends an
     INVALID_VOTERID_FAILURE error to the EVM:
         EVM Id +
         Voter Id +
         INVALID_VOTERID_FAILURE +
         ValidatorSignature(
             INVALID_VOTERID_FAILURE +
             Blind(Encrypted(Ballot . EN))
         )
     As described earlier, if the Voter has already casted a
     vote, the Validator sends a proof of the vote, which
     contains:
         REPEAT_VOTE_FAILURE +
         Proof
         Where Proof is:
         EVM Id +
         Voter Id +
         Request_Timestamp +
         PreviousBlind(Encrypted(Ballot . EN)) +
         VoterSignature(PreviousBlind(Encrypted(Ballot . EN))) +
         VoterSignature(EN)
     Once the EVM has received responses from all Validators, it
     informs the voter that their vote was casted. If all
     Validators sent a positive response the EVM prints out the
     message "Vote successfully casted" (immediately following
     the previously printed Voter Id), and instructs the voter to
     take the printed receipt. If any of the Validators return a
     failure, the EVM prints out all Validator responses,
     including the steps for unblinding and decrypting the
     original vote. A little later I will demonstrate how this
     receipt can be used to detect various types of tampering and
     attacks on the system. For now, we will assume validation
     was successful. For a successful validation, the EVM removes
     the blind and is left with ``n' validated encrypted ballots:
         Validator_1_Signature(Encrypted(Ballot . EN))) ..
         Validator_n_Signature(Encrypted(Ballot . EN))) +
                               Encrypted(Ballot . EN)
     This data encapsulates a secret vote by a voter whose
     eligibility has been attested to by all competing
     Validators, none of whom know the way in which the vote was
     cast. Additionally, any independent party can now confirm
     the integrity of the vote by checking the Validator
     signatures.
     The EVM places the signatures, the ballot and the secret key
     used to encrypted the Ballot on a "Tally Queue". For votes
     that failed, the failure messages are placed on the Tally
     Queue instead.
     Tallying
     When the Election is over, several pieces of data are
     published over the Internet in a public forum that has
     properties of a Usenet group (ie. published information
     can't be retracted). First, the Validators publish their
     list of Voter Ids that casted a vote along with "proofs" of
     validation request, where the proof is exactly the same as
     one described above. This includes all the data on the two
     lists maintained by the Validators.
     Once Validators have published their lists, the proxy opens
     up the constraints on EVM communication, such that they can
     all talk to each other and read and write in the public
     forum. The proxy informs EVMs of this event and sends them a
     list of IP addresses all EVMs. The EVMs then participate in
     an Onion Routing protocol[12] to publish the encrypted
     ballots and Validator signatures on these ballots from their
     Tallying Queue. Once encrypted votes and Validator
     signatures are faithfully transmitted over to the public
     forum, EVMs enter a second round of Onion routing to publish
     the AES passwords to decrypt the votes. The Onion Routing
     protocol strips the origination information, so it becomes
     impossibly hard to corelate votes to EVMs, thereby making
     the publication anonymous.
     At this point, all data required to do a tally is available
     publically. It should be noted that almost everything that
     transpires during the election process, with the exception
     of the data that links the voters to their votes, is made
     public at the end of the election. This level of
     transparency is one of the greatest benefits of a well
     designed electronic voting system.
     In Athens, the tallying is done by the Election Authority,
     but anyone equiped with Tallying software can check the
     tally independently. Athens tally is straightforward. Ballots
     that have valid signatures from _all_ Validators are
     selected as countable votes. These are decrypted with the
     published AES secret keys, votes are separated from the
     Election Number, and counted to produce a final tally.
     Security of Athens
     To analyse the security of Athens, I will show how various
     common attacks are made trivially detectable by the Athens
     architecture.
     Denial of Vote Attacks
     The pre-election registration verification keeps the
     Registrar honest. If the registrar drops people from the
     Register, there's a high probability that the drop will be
     detected and the Registrar will be answerable in a court of
     law. Since competing parties are independently undertaking the
     verification, it is in everyones interest to keep the
     process honest.
     During the election, two different types of denial attacks
     are possible. The first attack is where one of the
     competitors know (based on the Voter Id, or region), the way
     in which the voter will cast a vote. Outspoken supporters,
     representatives and volunteers of a party are vulnerable to
     this attack. A competing Validator could try to deny them
     the vote by raising one of the three possible errors:
     INVALID_VOTERID_FAILURE, VERIFY_FAILURE or
     REPEAT_VOTE_FAILURE.
     To protect from the INVALID_VOTERID_FAILURE denial attack, a
     copy of the register is published widely prior to the
     commencement of the elections. A receipt generated by the
     EVM with a valid Voter Id and an INVALID_VOTERID_FAILURE
     notice is an easily established proof of Validators'
     corruption. VERIFY_FAILURE is also trivially established
     with help of the positive validation requests from competing
     Validators (also on the receipt), the public Register and
     the voter's Voting Card.
     The attack based on the third error, REPEAT_FAILURE is more
     interesting. What if a Validator refuses to Validate a vote
     by claiming that the Voter has already voted? In that case,
     the Validator must provide a proof of the previous
     Validation request. Since the proof contains a signature
     made on both the EM and the Blinded ballot by Voter's secret
     key, the Validator cannot provide such a proof with the
     knowledge of the key - which is unavailable to the
     Validator. This is why Athens requires Validators to keep a
     copy of all validation requests, and conducts the validation
     process in 2-steps, so the first validation request can't be
     used as a proof. Also, since the Election Number is encoded
     in the ballot, and a signed EN is part of the proof,
     validation requests from previous elections can't be cited
     as proofs. An incorrect proof is easily verifiable by the
     EVM as well as the voter and a court of law with help of the
     printed receipt.
     A different kind of denial of vote attack can be mounted by
     the EVMs. In this attack the EVMs withhold publication of
     validated votes. However, such withholding is easily
     discovered in Athens because the list of proofs published
     by the Validators indicate the number of casted and
     verified votes.
     Ballot Stuffing Attacks
     There are several ways in which an attacker can try to stuff
     ballots. The first method, that was discussed earlier, is by
     registering fake voters during the registration process.
     Since the Register is open to independent scrutiny by all
     competitors, the risks of adding fake voters is high and
     hence discouraged.
     Another ballot stuffing attack is to cast votes for
     absentees. This attack is very hard in Athens, since it
     requires the knowledge of absentees' secret keys.
     The third way to stuff the ballot is for an eligible voter
     to cast multiple votes. This is made impossible in Athens
     with help of Validation proofs. Even when the Validators
     of n-1 colluding parties (where n is the number of
     competing parties), validate multiple requests from
     Mallory (a colluding voter), the non-colluding party is
     able to present a proof of Mallory's first vote and deny
     all subsequent requests with impunity. The Tallying
     process requires an affirmation from _all_ Validators, so
     such votes are not counted.
     Vote Alteration Attacks
     The Athens protocol requires that EVMs act honestly on the
     behalf of the Voter. A corrupt EVM could easily display to
     the voter that it has casted a vote their choice, but
     actually cast the vote for another party. This attack would
     be impossible if the EVM was required to print out a
     receipt of every vote that included the blinded ballot,
     signed by Voter's secret key, the steps to unblind it and
     the secret AES key with which the actual vote was
     encrypted. The voter could then look up the encrypted
     ballot after it was published and ensure the vote was cast
     and counted correctly. Doing this, however, would leave the
     voter with a proof of vote that could lead to vote coercion
     or vote buying.
     It is not sufficient to blindly trust the EVM either. Code
     reviews, or open source development of the EVM software
     (while should be encouraged) do not guarantee that the code
     running on the deployed EVM is the one that was reviewed. To
     keep the EVMs honest, Athens implements a sub-protocol for
     EVM verification.
     All competing parties add a few thousand fake voters to
     their own copy of the Register, and generate corresponding
     voting cards. These voting cards are then used by designated
     verifiers (volunteers) to cast arbitrary votes (usually for
     the party that runs the Validator) to test the EVMs. The
     volunteers are normal, eligible voters with multiple voting
     cards - they first vote with their real card, and then pull
     out the fake ones to run a series of tests. When the
     designated verifier casts a vote with one of the faked card,
     the vote is verified correctly by the Verifying Validator
     (the one who has the fake keys on it copy of the Register),
     while other n-1 Validators decline validation with an
     INVALID_VOTERID_FAILURE. This causes the EVM to print out
     the entire transaction, down to the selection of the actual
     vote that the EVM tried to validate.
     If the EVM is systematically altering votes, the designated
     verifier ends up with a receipt showing a selection that was
     different from his actual selection. If the EVM attempts to
     cover up its deception by printing a receipt that says "Vote
     successfully casted", the designated verified immediately
     knows the EVM is lying, since the n-1 Validators would have
     failed the verification. If the EVM tries to back paddle and
     cast a correct vote after it receives the
     INVALID_VOTERID_FAILUREs, the duplicate vote attempt is
     detected by (at least) the Verifying Validator, who responds
     with a proof of the previous validation request. Unable to
     differentiate a normal voter from a designated verifier
     before sending a verification request, the EVM is forced to
     act honestly.
     Athens requires the physical constraint of using a proxy for
     all communications originating from the EVMs, to ensure EVMs
     have no out-of-bound, out-of-protocol communications with
     Validators and other parties. This provides a single,
     focused point of observation for the competing parties, and
     can be performed fairly easily with a protocol decoder.
     In sum, Athens uses cryptographic primitives to build an
     electronic voting system that ties in the processes of
     registration, voting, and tallying into a protocol that is
     secure, anonymous and truly transparent. Since all aspects
     of the protocol are verifiable the potential for fraud is
     greatly reduced. Even more importantly, open systems like
     Athens inspire confidence and promote participation in the
     election process - the very foundation of democracy.
     Partial Observability
     "Participation" brings us to the one of the topics that
     originally led to my interest in electronic voting. I know
     many intelligent and politically sensitive Indians who have
     never casted a vote in Indian democratic elections. I am
     one of them. My reason for electoral inaction is not
     apathy, but simple statistics. In a country of a billion
     people, my vote doesn't really count. To be more precise,
     if one party wins by 80% then my vote, in either direction,
     is not useful. However, if a party that I don't support
     happens to win by a small margin, my vote (and those of
     others like me) could have made all the difference. Of
     course, I have no way of knowing this till it is too late.
     I could pay attention to gallop and exit polls, but those
     can be quite wrong as demonstrated in the Indian general
     elections earlier this year.
     It is no surprise that the voter turnout in what is
     perceived to be a hotly contested election is higher than
     expected. A comprehensive IDEA survey[13] on voter turnout
     failed to find corelations between turnout and various
     factors they studied, but they found that "there does seem
     to be a clear link between voter turnout and the
     competitiveness of electoral politics in a political
     system. In the 542 elections where the largest party won
     less than half of the votes turnout was a full 10% higher
     than the 263 elections where a single party won over 50% of
     the popular vote."
     Publishing partial results is a tactical nightmare in paper
     based or electronic counter based elections. However, a
     system like Athens could enter the Tally phase several times
     during the election at no additional cost to provide an
     "intermediate tally". The frequency and timing of the
     intermidiate tallies could be function of the size of the
     electorate and number of uncounted votes - large enough to
     protect the anonymity of the voters and small enough to
     provide an updating sense of the final result. The
     intermediate tallies could be broadcastd on TV, Radio and
     the Internet (much like Stock tickers), and would functions
     as "get out the vote" campaigns, to encourage the
     statistically informed to go out and vote.
     This property of elections that I like to call "partial
     observability", could greatly boost participation and
     otherwise alter the dynamics of the election process. It is
     just one of the ways in which electronic voting could
     qualitative change the elections and democracy.
