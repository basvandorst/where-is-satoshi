Um. Does this ICTF understand the implications of sending forged cancel
messages outside its own server, when the cancels are based strictly on
disapproval of the content? Do they realize what the consequences will be
for carriage of traffic from their node?
Is Germany about to become known as "Cancelbunny Nation"?
This is a wonderful type in the fifth word above... ;-)

["protection of society" yadda yadda]
You forgot firewalls, Tim. Only fools thought firewalls would be voluntary.
Also, proxy servers. So much for proxy-server technology being "voluntary";
pity the poor fools who claimed it had legitimate applications and should
not be banned because of the probability that it would also be used for
immoral purposes such as censorship.
(Not that I disagree with you about the Europeans, or at least those who
wrote this document. This paragraph was particularly interesting:
"The principal social objection to this policy scenario [i.e. people
deciding for themselves what they want to see and read] is that it does not
in any way act to reduce abuse [by which the authors appear to mean
'publication of content they consider offensive'] either on the Internet or
in the 'real' world."
Seldom does one see so clearly laid out the reasons for opposition to
personal freedom: letting people make their own choices Doesn't Punish
Those with Bad Ideas.)

If that were all that were going on, no one would argue with it.
The problem arises when government bodies require use of a particular
filter (as in libraries), or require publishers to attach derogatory labels
to the information they publish (as in too many trial balloons for me to
list). These are abuses of freedom, and if you pay attention, you'll see
that such applications of filter and labeling programs receive the lion's
share of vocal opposition.
There are a couple of subsidiary problems - one is that current filterware
is, not to put too fine a point on it, terrible to the point of
constituting fraud on the consumer; another is with the issue of minors'
rights to access information they need, and the limits that parents and
schools must observe in restricting those rights while still fulfilling
their responsibilities. Current filterware would still be criticized -
rightly so - even if it weren't being used for censorship. But the fact is
that it is being so used.
Someday, perhaps the threat of censorship-via-filters will go away and we
can spend less time discussing them.

This is why holding actions help. Confusing Congress enough to delay taking
up encryption bans may eventually win the war, if in the time between
enough people begin to use and understand encryption that politicians see a
downside in upsetting that many voters by deleting their privacy.
I believe the same factors worked for us in the recent CDA/net-censorship
"I'm from the government, and I'm here to help you recover your keys."
