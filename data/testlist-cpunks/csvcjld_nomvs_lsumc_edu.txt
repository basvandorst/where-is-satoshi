192.239.70.124 hit my ftp site on 4/13/98, the day after I announced a
program to crack simple substitution ciphers on this list.  When I
announced the program, I accidently gave it an .exe extension (when it
actually had a .zip extension).  192.239.70.124 tried to get the .exe
extension and then gave up.  Is it possible that 192.239.70.124 is
driven by I've since purchased a $10 article from the ACM and extended my program
to implement G.W.Hart's algorithm; the result is archived as
ftp://colbleep.ocs.lsumc.edu/pub/crypto/simplsub/win95/gwhart.zip.  C
source code is included; it should compile under Unix as well as Windows
