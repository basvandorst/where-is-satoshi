References: <20130825235403.BDDC4EAABC
In the full context of the question and the answer, Zimmermann explains
that because they didn't have a smartphone client for PGP, they were forced
to hold the keys on their servers. Under these conditions, a court order
could force him to silently wiretap users who otherwise believe their
product is secure.
I don't know enough to evaluate his decision not to use PGP on smartphones,
and what the challenges there are. It's also possible he was incorrect or
misleading in marketing Silent Circle's email service - the question starts
with "You said in the past that Silent Circle’s products were secure
because you don’t hold the encryption keys...", and that is obviously not
the case (for email).
But I certainly wouldn't assume he's bought off. In the full scenario he
describes, that Silent Circle was in, it was impossible for them to
guarantee end-to-end encrypted email bodies in the long run. That's all
he's saying.

I know most of the people on here have transcended the earthbound, maudlin
Certificate Authority system, but as services-adopting-SSL-news goes, I'm
particular excited about Github
which started quietly supporting SSL for *.github.io domains a few weeks
I'm excited because Github Pages is powerful, verrrrry flexible, and
totally free. AFAIK, it's the only major blog/web host that gives you free
SSL, backed by a high quality CDN (since everything is static files).
To promote the occasion and nudge Github to take it further, I wrote up my
own experience, and a little how-to for forcing redirects via Jekyll:
Along with Cloudflare's 2014 plan to offer SSL termination for free, and
their stated plan to double SSL on the Internet by end of year, the barrier
to HTTPS everywhere is dropping rapidly.

For what it's worth, I think CloudFlare dropping the price of SSL is going
to force other companies to follow suit, so hopefully their move creates
competition that both reduces CloudFlare dependency and increases the
amount of encrypted traffic on the web.
For example, today I learned that Amazon CloudFront finally dropped the
price of SSL in front of S3 for custom domains from $600/month(!!) to
$0/month:  (As long as
you're comfortable using SNI, which excludes users on Windows XP.)
CloudFlare is hopefully just one part of the tip of the spear.

I've read the Intercept's writeup[1], and read through Citizen Lab's
writeup[2]. I'm having trouble understanding the attack surface, and how
widely applicable the vulnerability is.
Are MS and Google targeted because of their ubiquity, or is there also
something (besides not using HTTPS) that they did to make their services
How can there be a remote code vulnerability so low in the stack that it
can be injected at the packet level, but high enough that TLS encryption
foils the attack?
Does this affect Windows only? Through particular browsers?
I'm certainly up for using this as an argument for how difficult it is to
predict the severity and creativity of MITM attacks, but I would like to
better understand the magnitude of the disclosure.

References: I am a huuuge fan and optimist for WebRTC. It has only just barely begun to
be available in the latest stable versions of modern browsers, so we are
still in the calm before the storm of experimentation. (A bit like
WebSockets a few years ago, but the ramifications of P2P connections are, I
think, more profound than adding real-time capabilities.)
One website I use to get across the power of WebRTC is Sharefest:
It's file-sharing without a cloud. The central service just assigns UUIDs
and does the initial signaling, but the file transfer happens P2P. Extra
neat feature: the file and associated permalink stays "alive" as long as
any one person has their tab open. (It warns you if you're the last person
and you try to close the tab.)
As WebRTC gets mind-share and browser-share, I think you'll see a lot of
effort devoted to lowering the usability and accessibility barrier to
decentralized technology on the web.

This seems like a good project, that will move PGP usability and standards
forward. It's also a big deal for Google to throw its support to the
project, since it is in direct tension with the business model Gmail is
built on (scanning your emails).
The auto-update feature is a big deal that will have to get wrestled with
openly as this moves further. Perhaps they'll work out a separate update
policy for it, who knows. But it'll also have applications outside of a
place in the Chrome Web Store.
For example, hopefully much of this work (especially the JS crypto work)

@_subject: Using some crypto to make gov't dataset identifiers better 
So this is a little different from the usual fare here, but my colleague
Tom Lee at the Sunlight Foundation has been thinking about using basic
cryptographic concepts to convince governments to publish more unique
identifiers in their datasets -- even when the identifiers they have in
their *databases* is sensitive (like SSNs).
The problem of anonymizing unique data is in some senses easier than others
here, because in some gov't contexts, making things personally identifiable
isn't the problem -- the *intent* is to publish personally identifiable,
connect-able information, like for campaign donors and lobbyists. So the
Mosaic Effect (de-anonymizing Netflix data) is less of a concern. Depends
on the problem, though.
After talking about it on a

Your feedback would be very welcome, either here or in public fora. Of
course, convincing government agencies to actually do this sort of thing
might be a challenge, but there's a lot of levels and branches of
government out there - you never know who might lead the way.

Moxie's laid out very clear reasons for why he uses Google Play and
discourages other people from building it. You may not agree with him, but
he at least has what I think is a coherent security model that he's
sticking to.
Really great discussion on it here:
Namely, he trusts apps signed with his signature (a process he manages
using his own airgapped system) and that's it. *You* may not hinge your
trust of the application on his signature, but he does, and he wants
ideally every TextSecure install to have it.
Both threads above are from before the CyanogenMod deal. To make that
happen, Moxie's team built a secure self-update path for the app, which
removed most of the barriers to requiring Google Play.
The other main barrier is push delivery, which right now uses Google Cloud
Messaging. High quality push delivery to a kabillion devices is very hard,
and not easy to replace. However, Moxie has encouraged people to take
advantage of the server's WebSockets support, and to build an option for
that into the client if they want to remove the last barrier to Google
support -- while warning that WebSockets delivery will not be nearly as
good as GCM-based delivery.
I was talking with a friend about this over the weekend, and I think that
the push that's happening for fully reproducible builds -- where every
build produces an identical binary with an identical hash -- would resolve
some of the issues Moxie has.
Then, Moxie can sign the hash of the binary, and others who build the
source code or get binaries from other places can verify that hash. That
still requires some tooling or verification UX, and for builds to be
reproducible by other people than Moxie, but it could make a difference.

@_subject: Doing HTTPS everywhere in the .gov space 
I wrote a piece today for my organization, 18F, about our HTTPS-everywhere
policy for the .gov websites we build inside the US government:
I wanted to give this list some extra context, since I understand the US
government is a big, complicated, freighted topic. Below is my *personal*
attempt to describe my workplace and is not anything close to an official
description or the voice of the government.
18F[1] is a team of ~70 people working as full time employees inside the US
federal government. (The name comes from the street intersection -- 18th St
& F St -- that its HQ is at in DC.) 18F as a unit was created around a year
ago to be a competent, top class in-house technology team for the US
federal government.
A driving idea here is that the government shouldn't need to outsource its
*entire* technical brain to contractors, and that government services can
be simple and even beautiful. If you've noticed what's happened over the
last few years in the UK at  by the Government Digital
Service[2], 18F takes a lot of inspiration from them.
18F is housed inside the General Services Administration, an independent
federal agency[3] that does as many different things as its name implies,
from running all the buildings to housing the nation's data catalog at
Data.gov. It's an "independent" federal agency in that it's not subject to
the same level of direct executive and White House control that cabinet
agencies are. It's the same kind of "independent" that lets the FCC
potentially disagree with the President on net neutrality, for example.
The team has people all over the country (it has a big SF office, for
example), many of which have either never been in government before, or who
came in after doing the Presidential Innovation Fellows[4] program.
I joined 18F after working for 5 years on open data apps, infrastructure,
and policy at the Sunlight Foundation[5], a non-profit in DC that pushes
for open government. I had also done a fair amount of work around privacy,
HTTPS, and ongoing judicial activity around surveillance. I get to continue
doing all of that work in my personal capacity.
I say this just to try to communicate that the 18F team has some very
sincere people trying to make the US government work better for people all
over the world, and to do right by technology in the process. We have
substantial support and autonomy to make that happen.
When it comes to HTTPS, the .gov surface area is absolutely enormous, and
moving it helps move the whole Internet forward. Bringing the government in
line with the rest of the web/security community (and being loud about it)
is one of my big priorities at 18F, and so I wanted to share this here with
you all.

I wasn't trolling. I've been a member of this list, and paying close
attention to the field, since well before I joined the US government (which
happened back in May).
Before this, I worked for 5 years at a relatively adversarial non-profit
group focused on government transparency, called the Sunlight Foundation.
I also did personal work on furthering encryption and drawing attention to
government surveillance:
I still work on them, and stuff like it, in my personal capacity. I'm on
the record in all kinds of places, in my personal capacity, supporting what
Edward Snowden did and pushing for technical changes and policy reform to
curtail surveillance.
I completely expect (and find welcome and appropriate) high levels of
skepticism for anything the US government does. All I can tell you is where
I'm coming from, and the actions my team is taking.
In my government capacity, when  is operational next
year, I hope to get as many .gov domains to use their certificates as I can.

That's my memory as well. I also don't remember any cognitive dissonance
between Poitras' and Greenwald's answers to Snowden's question about how
much background to go into. The film doesn't portray a lot of daylight
between Snowden and Greenwald in what they want to do, really.
But that's what you should expect from the movie, I think, given a) how
close Poitras and Greenwald are, and b) that the movie is clearly meant to
tell Snowden's story and show his motives and impact, not amplify any drama
between the people involved.
The movie didn't cover, for example, Greenwald misleading the entire world
on why David Miranda was detained at the Heathrow airport. Greenwald
initially insisted it was simply the gov't applying pressure on Greenwald
by harassing his family, lambasting the government as cruel despots, and
didn't say anything about Miranda carrying an encrypted hard drive. You can
still criticize the government for detaining him how they did, but lying
about the reasons, to get an edge on defining how the news cycle talks
about it -- that corrodes trust.
But, you know, that's fine, that's for others to tell. CITIZENFOUR is about
Snowden's decisions, not Greenwald's decisions, and it does a great job at
communicating and humanizing them.
