@_subject: Unix passwd-cracker online? 
administrator at  very famous university in Mexico, that more than one person has obtained a specific password by entering the desired adresses'passord on a submnit form in a Web page.
couple of hackers (the 'ethic' kind, if they can be called so), this would imply pretty much of a piece of technical work, and probably, the presence of human support to get such a system working.
never have it if there really is such, but this came to my mind when i read the posts  on the plate-numbers-in-Oregon polemica. I would appreciate any kind of opinions on this specific topic, not the ones saying> Well, if there's  ftp acces to /etc/passwd, and this is not shadowed, bla, bla, bla. I mean real opinions...
