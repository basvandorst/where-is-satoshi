This legislation would also require mandatory reporting by ISPs of
subscribers' traffic patterns?
"Most people don't have any legitimate business writing for public
consumption on blogs."
"Most people don't have any legitimate business owning cars that can go

Bell) gotten so much as a scratch at the hands of a threatener?
