@_subject: An idea about Java and remailer clients and servers... 
User X on Machine A sends a form via HTTP (or a variant- SHTTP, HTTPS, etc.)
to Machine B.  User Y on Machine C receives an anonymous mail from Machine
B.  Suspecting User X, User Y sends a mail to be anonymized and sent back to
himself to User X.  User X's temporary remailer does as it's told.  User Y
now has a strong reason to suspect User X has sent the said mail.
Cpunks write code and all, but I don't think this one's going to work. :-(
