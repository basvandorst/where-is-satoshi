References: Do you have a link and/or expanded information on the specifics?
Does this method work for apps that are generating and testing lots of keys or does the initial key generation step still have to be undertaken?  The whole point of the blowfish technique was to increase the attackers required effort.  It was basicly assumed that valid users would simply store the expanded key.  Is their a link somewhere to more information on this technique or could you expand on it?
