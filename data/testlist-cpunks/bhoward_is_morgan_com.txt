programs come and go but protocols live forever.
i don't think you've looked around enough; in my own experience, kermit
has been available and in-use within every computing environment i've
operated or observed.  there are varying degrees of usage but its always
kept around, often because it seems to work in strange communications
conditions where other protocols fail.
there are many places outside of the bbs world where people need to shuffle
files around and might desire encryption.  your opinions not withstanding,
i believe that kermit is more pervasive that you think.  if the purpose of
this exercise is to maximize the audience to which we make available easy
and useful encryption facilities, then kermit and things of its ilk need to
be supported.
