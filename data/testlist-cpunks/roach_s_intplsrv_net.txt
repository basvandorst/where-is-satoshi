Beautiful sentiment, and much of it I'm not prepared to argue with.
First of all, I'm going to place my comments among your message.  This is not to present the appearance of a winning arguement, but only for ease of keeping track of the points.
At 10:41 AM 10/4/2000, Secret Squirrel wrote, or rather forwarded:
News to me, I won't argue.  We've done it before, we're doing it now, we'll do it again.
If means of production means property, then consider the following concept.  I, joe farmer, have with my own two hands built a tractor.  This tractor is now the product of my production, but by it's very nature, it's also the means of production.  Who owns it?  Do I benefit by my own labor?  Or does society, for the greater good, "liberate" it from me as a means of production?  If it's to be "liberated", what's the point of me even bothering to go to the trouble of producing a tractor when the next ten people, who used thier time wisely to manufacture guns, decides they need it more than I do?
I, as joe farmer, have "reclaimed", (inaccurate, as the land was not previously claimed for this use, but the terminology seems current), a farm, on which I intend to grow grain.  I get the grain up to about knee height and just producing a harvestible crop, when Brett Rancher, decides to use this common land for graising.  Do I as the person who toiled on the land to make it produce get to keep the grain?  Or is it mutual property that is fair game to all?  If I'm not going to reap what I sow, what's the point of wasting a growing season carrying water, and weeding rows?
Now I'm Joe Farmer Jr.  My father built a tractor, scratched a farm out of the wilderness, and defended both against all comers because they were the product of his own two hands.  He, wanting to pass on the heritage, bequethes, (yes,  I know, the spelling isn't right), this produce to me.  I didn't produce it myself, rather I was expected to work it until I reached majority, and have over the last 20 years assumed more and more responsibility as my father has lost the capacity to continue to work the land.  I still went to him for guidance, but it was my own two hands that overhauled that old tractor, and without my labor, the farm would have reverted to wilderness.  Are these products of my labor, or means to production?  If means to production, what reason do I have to do more than absolutely necessary to keep the two running until my father passes away?  Since I'm going to lose control of both at that time.
Now I'm Joe Gentleman Farmer 3rd.  I have built on the work of my father and his father, and now find that to adequately work with what I have requires more than my two hands, or those of my children and wife, to work.  Using some of my surplus produce, I've taken on an additional pair of hands to facilitate the work.  He's not worked this land since birth.  He hasn't, nor have his ancestors, toiled to make the tractor or farm feed the family.  Does he deserve an equal share to the output?  I've invested 40 years of my life.  My father invested 60+ of his, and his father 60+ of his, all with the assumption that this produce would stay in the family.  This worker has yet to invest one hour.  Does this make me a If people have unfettered political power, what is to prevent the mob from turning on the most productive to cough up their hard-earned gains for the "less fortunate"?  Perhaps the less fortunate, who since all wages are equal anyway for all producers, since there is often no real way of guaging who did more, particulary when more than one stage of production exists, decided to underrepresent their talents so that they could get off lighter?
When the many lead the few, you have the makings for a tyranny.  When the few lead the many, you have the makings for a tyranny.  If there is any chance of one man being more diligent than another, then one man will become more prosperous than another in the first generation.  In the second generation, I'll grant you, the less prosperous man's son may be more diligent, but starting from a weaker position.
Except by taking that produced by anothers labor, but inadequately defended.  Granted, that happens anyway.  Only the methods of defense shift from most deadly and determined, to most litigous, (my apologies to the lawyers of this list, my spelling was never my strong suit,) and determined, both modified by resources at ones disposal to make good on threats.  (Ammunition, friendly laws.)
If natural law does not exist, why does my dog urinate on my tire?  Are you saying we are much evolved from beasts?  I'd like to think so, but I find my own natural impulses too closely mirror those of "animals".  Including the desires to breed, attract a good mate, (through demonstration of my ability to support her), keep others of my kind at arms reach, etc.
So, if I were a master craftsman of looms, but had about the textile manufacture talent of a rock, I would not be allowed to maintain my looms and live by their produce?  Are you suggesting price protection for labor?  Or that I be forced to sell my looms.  Doesn't sound like I'm very free if I'm forced to liquidate that that I produced.
Are you saying that in a non-propertarian society, that I could simply choose not to work and still benefit the same as everyone else?  Sounds good to me, sign me up.  Of course, if there are too many of us, how are you going to feed us all and yourself too?  If we're going to be forced to work, you're now talking about limiting freedom.  How are you to guage that I'm doing my fair share?  Perhaps I'm an economist, who's labors don't translate well on paper but still are key to the functioning of society as a whole.  OR, perhaps I'm a valued leader of men, who can organize to better effeciency the labor of others.  But, if I'm a manager, who can coax 10% extra result from the same effort of those who follow me, does that mean that I should have that 10%, or a fixed share of it, as my contribution?  Sounds like a manager, or a boss, to me.
I won't argue that there are abuses.  Any system will have abuses.  Capitalism has the abuse that those who have inherited the produce of thier forefathers, but none of their drive, will still flourish.  While those who have not the gains of their ancestors, but the determination that the former lack, will not see all, or even most, of their value.
The problem is, in a socialist system, the man without any skills or the desire to gain, or use, them, can be just as abusive.  There are, in my opinion, far more lazy persons then there ever could be wealthy persons.  And far more lazy persons in general, than there could ever be lazy wealthy persons.
I seem to remember that "Utopia" literally meant "doesn't exist".
I'd say a capitalist is one who strives to gain more than he had, by trading in a market, and in the process produce more, and better methods of production, since with better methods of production, more can be produced with the same effort.
I'd hate to have to hoe a row by hand.  Tractors are much more efficient.
Can you honestly see any type of industrial revolution occuring from common labor?  If I gain status by developing steam power, then I've just been elevated to a new class.  If I gain profit from the licenses, same deal.
This really is unfair, since the original author isn't on the list to refute.  But I'm sure he, (or she), will find a worthy champion.
Good luck,
Sean Roach

Yes, if you ONLY restrict inflation, those who come first can purchase your full stock and resell it to a higher bidder later.  Simple supply and demand.  From my perspective, this would only work if the government also limited the buyers to a set amount, and then included some element to restrict someone from hitting several stores for the same quota.  The three methods I can see to do the latter are, stiff penalties for buying more than allowed, ration tickets, and both.
Did the government have such limits in place?

Actually, I'm still smarting over the twin facts that the Oklahoma highway department, for the greater good, leveled two gas stations, one I considered a landmark, to widen a highway turn.  That Altus, the county seat here, "annexed" the surrounding area, and declared that only so many houses could be built per acre to appease the airbase, and regulate businesses outside thier borders by requiring a certain amount of the front of the buildings being bricked, without extending fire and police services to those controlled in either case.
I think the labor of a person is his own to use or sell as he sees fit.  If I agree to turn out wooden pencils for 6 dollars an hour, I have no arguement for demanding more if those pencils later sell for 10 bucks apiece.
Besides, my comments in that still quoted post, were based on how socialism was at least, if not more, abusable than what we have now.
I think you mis-read me.
That second quote about sacrificing for the herd was closer to the mark.  Substitute "could" for "should", "stupid" for "moral", and "popular" for "right".
And you have to admit, if tomorrow I gave all my worldly goods to the community at large, they would hail me a "good man" for at least the evening...while they snickered behind my back.

@_subject: CDR: Re: Disposable remailers 
If the net is sufficiently large, then the remailers can be considered to be registers, each holding one message for a random length of time, and allow reordering just by that alone.  Of course, for this to work, traffic analysis has to be defeated in another way.  Probably in ZKS's planned, but last I checked, not implemented, constant activity among nodes.
Of course, the more traffic, the easier it will be for the intranets where these things are set up to locate them, and take them down.
An alternative might be the method that gnutella uses.  Each remailer connects one time to a web page put up by the installer.  That web page has a limited number of URL's, mostly of other remailers also put up by that same installer, or that installers gang, (substitute cell, orginazition, liberation front, family, user's group, etc).  A few are shared by mundane means among cells probably through alt.anonymous.messages, or similar.  This allows the remailers to be linked across parties.  Each remailer keeps as many remailers in memory as it can, not to exceed a set number, for the safety of the others, and not to drop below another number, set based on practical use of the remailer.  (As an example, if a node only remembers 1 other, it no longer is useful for anything but an input or output node.  If it only remembers 2, all it can do is pass a message from one to the next.)  All this is kept in volatile memory.
The nodes ping each other on a regular basis, if a node fails to respond to a ping, that node is written off.  Perhaps the next general cover traffic includes information that such-n-such node appears to be compromised.  If a node receives NO pings, then it might also write itself off, and blank memory.
If extra nodes are occasionally inserted into the system by hailing known nodes and "topping off" their "neighbor list", then well hidden nodes can continue to be used, even after all the original neighboring nodes have been revealed and deactivated.  This could even be done through the node If a minimum of 3 neighbors is set, and a maximum of 7, and if each URL requires 8+8+8+8+16 bits to store an address, then each remailer needs 18-42 bytes extra in which to store addresses.  The URL for the web page can fill this memory for the first run, and would allow for, beyond the URL, 12-36 characters in the address.  Actually, message space could also be used to store this boot address, and therefore, shouldn't be a problem at all.  It could even be stored as a standard non-ip-number URL.  (Say  please note that if this url is functional, I don't know it.)
After setup, the node should forget everyone but it's neighbors, to protect them, anyway.
As I said above, if the latency is random, and the traffic suficient, re-ordering will just be a matter of one message taking a different, and longer, route than another, but by artifically increasing traffic, or even traffic increasing on it's own, you reduce the expected lifespan of the node.
All of the above.  Take home that I-coffee pot, add a tini, take it back to the store and apologize that you already had one that you're new inlaws gave you.  Same with the door lock, then apologize that your apartment super won't let you install it after all.  An extra level of obfuscation is thus created in that dupes install the very remailers that you rigged.  They are far less likely, as homeowners living in an electronic age, to realize there is more traffic going over thier connection than they bargained for.
Big brother becomes unwitting courier for the underground.
Or did you mean in addition to disposible remailers, instead of ways to hide, distribute them?

This could easily be the recipe for a flickering monitor.  First of all, the refresh rate needs to be probably in excess of twice what the human eye can see, just so a random signal can be detected before the old signal has if you can count to 4 in n length of time, then you can only reliably provide all the information in that time by keeping to the same order.
1,2,3,4. or 4,3,2,1 or 1,3,2,4, etc.  But not 1,2,3,4,3,2,4,1.  By the time it rewrote 1, the old 1 would be out of date, and it would appear that you had video problems, (shortly followed by a headache).
If you can count to 16, but only need to count to 4, then your options are 1,2,3,4,3,4,2,4,2,3,1,2,4,  11 commands from 1 to the next 1 in this example.  from line to that same line.  This would allow for a secure monitor that didn't invite eyestrain.

That sound like the Navajo codetalkers.
I can see two easy problems with this.
A secret shared is no secret.  If even one person versed in the language were to side with the opposing front, all records written in that cypher would become open.
A new language would have to have new words for practically everything.  Any borrowed word would open the language up to analysis.  If you didn't get around to inventing a word for digital recording.  You had digital, but you forgot recording, then saying  recording in a sentance, would give someone a clue to grammatical structure.  Unfortunately, to get a sufficient vocabulary to be flexible, would require a larger population using the language.
If the language is sufficiently difficult to learn, it might be useful as a code but it would be hard to extend the population who could use it.
If I remember my history, which is not to say that I do, the Codetalkers method worked because there was a small population who knew the language already, none of them were acquired by the Japaneese, learning the language was difficult, (the missionary who suggested it had managed to learn it some, if memory serves), and the language had existed, and been used, enough to be sufficiently complex.
Still not complex enough.  They had to spell some things out, like placenames.
If just two people contrived it, then what they might have to say to one another might be secure, but would be limited to topics they had discussed in detail before, or related topics.
If a population of 1,000 spoke it with fluency, and had for several years, the language may be able to deal with just about any current concept or object, but the opposition would almost certainly have access to the language as well.
This would seem to limit the language to making disparaging comments about the person ahead of you at the checkout stand, confident that she didn't know what you were saying about him or her.  Or discussing the shoplifting of luxeries with your schoolmates, relatively confident that the store clerk wouldn't know what you were planning, or even that you might not be casually discussing last nights game.  Both examples I've suspected I might have witnessed.

Personally, I think we should INCREASE crypto over this.  Put a crypto imbedded radio in the planes control electronics, with the key known only to the FAA, and existing only for that flight.  If there are flight problems, hit a switch from the tower and take over the plane from the ground.  Either instruct the autopilot to land at a pre-determined contingency location, fly it by remote from a simulator, or blow it up before it can be used as a battering ram.  The former two useful for on-flight emergencies too, such as an unconsious pilot.  Something else to consider.  Knockout gas in the passenger compartment and a solid door between passenger compartment and cockpit.
Also, why are we putting so many clerks in a handful of offices anyway?  Isn't this supposed to be the age of the paperless office?
