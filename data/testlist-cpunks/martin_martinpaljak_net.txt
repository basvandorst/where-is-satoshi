@_subject: [cryptography] -currently available- crypto cards with onboard 
I don't know about PGP(.com), but GnuPG is picky about hardware key
containers. Things like PKCS
I think there are plenty of PCI products from several vendors, incl
Thales(nCipher), SafeNet and others. But getting them "off the shelf"
might vary, depending on your budget and origin and whatnot.
You have not described your requirements (ops/sec, FIPS/CC etc) but if
the volume is low, you could take USB CryptoStick(s)
(crypto-stick.org), which is supported by GnuPG and what can do up to
4096 bit onboard keys, unfortunately only one signature/decryption
pair usable through GnuPG. Probably you can also stack them up and
populate with the same key for load sharing.
