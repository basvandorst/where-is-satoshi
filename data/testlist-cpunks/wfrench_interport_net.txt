Given the second possibility, I see no reason to hardwire a
remailer.  It really will make people suspicious!  I can easily
imagine someone deciding not to use that remailer again, just
on general principles.
  And anyway, chaining is not always necessary, especially if
the sender is at a public Web terminal or using an anonymous Web
proxy.  The remailers don't enforce chaining, why should you?

  But if you don't put your name and e-mail address at the

Please don't do anything like this.  This will prevent people
like me who prefer the "random" method from participating.

I don't get it.  If the challenge is partly secret, how will I
know if I crack the code?
  ?  Sorry, the terminology seems to be over my head here.
  That is one reason I like the random method.
  A clarification: my "it" above refers to a successful cracking
of the code.

Why would I want to do such a thing?  And if I did, why would
anyone care?
  Absolutely.  And the simplest way to do that is to use the
random method!
  What is the significance of this rather ominous warning?

This distinction is valid in the current series of academic
exercises.  However, if we were actually trying to break
something important, anything that might accelerate the crack
would be a form of participation.  And as Nathan Loofbourrow has
pointed out, the random method is much more secure against
real-world retaliation.  It's also the only method that will
work for me; I use a shell account, and I never know in advance
when I will get time on the computers at work (which aren't on
the net at all).
  I _don't_ care about the procedures, as long as I can get the
information I need to go my own way.

Perhaps I wasn't clear... by real-world retaliation, I'm
referring to being sued, thrown in jail, belabored about the
head with blunt objects, etc.  The three basic defenses I have
are: (a) not getting people angry, (b) not letting them know who
to be angry at, or (c) the threat of counter-retaliation.  The
"random" method is of type (b).
  I think you are focusing a bit too much on theoretical
efficiency and not enough on bottom-line practicality.  A 37%
waste factor is better than staying in bed and wasting it all.
Yes, this is currently true, but there was a suggestion of
witholding part of the challenge in order to keep people honest,
or something like that.  I didn't quite understand it, but I
didn't like it.

I disagree.  If (quite hypothetically) I were one of the
"models" in such a magazine (I'm 27 now, so I would have been 7
at the time it was published), I would certainly consider anyone
posessing a copy, today or 20 years ago, to be exploiting me.
  However, that doesn't mean I would want them criminalized for
it.  In fact, my "anyone possessing a copy" above includes the
Government (and third parties such as the Guardian Angels) in
the course of a kiddie-porn investigation/prosecution.  It's a
very hard question.
  And yes, people who download Simpson crime scene photos are
exploiting (not killing) Nicole and Ron.  When I have been shown
these photos, I have quickly averted my eyes. This is simple
human decency, not to mention respect for the dead.

Except it's not very effective, is it, since he's still
posting flames?  In any case, it's an admission on John
Gilmore's part that libertarianism can't work without some
measure of authoritarianism; the only argument is over _just how
much_ authoritarianism we need.
  I'm quite upset about this.  Up to now I was able to tell
people that "there is at least one mailing list on the net that
functions in a completely open manner".  No more.

Until now, I'd considered the list as a model of a libertarian
society, with the listowner as the government.  My point is that
if a mailing list (where physical force is generally not a
factor) can't be run without arbitrary sanctions against
members, how could anyone ever hope for a whole society, with a
real, gun-toting government, to run that way?
