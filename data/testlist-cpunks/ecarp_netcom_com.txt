That only works for sensitive information that is likely to be leaked.  The NSA doesn't do that for every FOUO and classified document it has - if it did, it'd never get anything else done, it'd be so busy doing that stuff.  Even with software to do the synonym sonkey-work, it'd take a massive amount of work to print different copies of every single document the NSA has.
I did find one interesting thing about FOUO documents mentioned, though - how can FOUO documents be exempt from the FOIA?  That doesn't make sense, unless it was either a deliberate evasion on the part of the NSA to attempt to mislead the innocent and naive.  Either a document is classified (and therefore subject to the standard classified document review process) or it isn't.  Sorry, but they can't have their cake and eat it, too.
Of course, I could be wrong.  Their SPOs carry guns, too...

How about generating a secure hash and using that as an index into a table?  If there's an address already there, use that - otherwise, generate one.
Generate the hash from the incoming address, of course.  That way, you don't need to keep track of anon-id-to-real-id mappings, yet guarantee that each user has one and only one anon address. Of course, folks coming in from different hosts will have different anon ID's.
Or have I missed some blindingly obvious technical point thaqt would make this impossible?

@_subject: uses for PGP 
khijol (formerly khijol.yggdrasil.com) is a 486/25 running the Linux operating
system.  Until March 1 of this year, khijol was used almost exclusively as a
place where subscribers to the newsgroup alt.sexual.abuse.recovery could meet
electronically and discuss abuse issues.  Anonymous accounts were freely given,
and site names, etc. were not tracked, allowing the users complete anonymity.
Several UNIX utilities were modified so as to obfuscate site names and user
names (in the case of rlogin), so that people could have a sense that their
privacy was ensured.
Many of the people who used khijol were survivors of sexual abuse, often from
within their own families. Many were still being abused, and were frightened
for their safety, and their lives.  It was not uncommon to join a group of
survivors and discover that one of the group was actively suicidal and the
rest of the group was trying to help get them "over the hump".
In the 5 months of its operation, khijol had over 500 anonymous users.  The
system was available (and used) 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  As it was
directly on the Internet, survivors from all over the world used khijol, and
it was not uncommon to find 20 or 30 users on the system at any one time.
Anonymity and security were a primary concern for most users, and I tried to
make khijol as secure as possible.
Many custom utilities were written for khijol, including an interactive multi-
user "talk" facility that is similar to IRC, but did not allow for non-local
connections.  To facilitate the completely anonymous exchange of email, and
to ensure the privacy of the users, PGP was pressed into service.  Users
could, from an easy-to-use full screen curses-driven menu, generate a key
(their public key was automatically added to a public list) and select user(s)
to send encrypted email to.  "pgp -m" was added to ELM's configuration, so
that decryption would be automatic - one only had to type their password.
It was emphasized to the users that no one could read their encrypted email
except the person for whom it was intended.
ASs it turned out, PGP was a very welcome addition - many felt that their
communications were being monitored and their email read (by curious system
administrators), and so most users welcomed the addition.
At the moment, khijol is connected to the net via UUCP only - I am looking for
a new home for it.  When it comes back, it will be announced on

I disagree with Brad's interpretation.  For example, if I photocopy a book and anonymously snail mail it to people, do you think the postal service is going to take the fall?  Nope - they are just a carrier, and are not responsible for content.  Like the common carriers - they just receive a message and pass it along.  They aren't responsible for message content.  If Brad Templeton's view of the world was the prevailing (or correct) one, then every common carrier in the country, including Ma Bell and the US Postal Service, would not exist, because they would've been sued out of existence long ago.
Of course, this situation illustrates yet another interesting twist on the old "denial of service" attacks... I understand Brad's interest in making money from Clarinet's product (and I don't have a problem with him making money), but I think that this "scare tactic" is going a bit too far in protecting corporate revenue.

I understand your objections, but think about it this way: nothing in the world says that you have to put a return address on the envelope.  Nothing in the world says that you have to present any form of ID in order to drop a letter into a postal box.  Sure, the postal inspectors have to "cooperate", but if you drop a letter with no return address into a box, how could they trace it back to you?  Are people going to say to the US postal folks, "hey, it's *your* fault that they didn't put a return address on their envelope!"  I think not.
Similarly, I think that anonymous remailers, like the post office, ma bell, etc., are common carriers.  You can't have it both ways - either you are a common carrier and exercise no editorial control over what goes through your remailer, or you are a publisher, and are held to a certain degree of legal responsibility.

Um, this is pretty paranoid shit.  The source for PGP is freely available - and the first thing that was done after it was released was that people started looking at the source for exactly the kinds of things that you mention.  None were found.
Of course, there *could* be glaring weaknesses in PGP internally -- and that's why the NSA chose to allow it to propogate, just like they did DES.
But I don't believe that there was a conspiracy on the part of the author of PGP - after all, that's one more person outside of the control of the NSA that would know what was going on, and PRZ's anarchistic tendancies are well-known :)

While I will say that guns and housing projects are important topics, as well as the loss of our individual freedoms, I will agree with my esteemed colleague from the great state of California that this list *is* about writing code, etc.
In that spirit, spurred on by my f**king netcom account being broken into by some idiot with a packet sniffer, I've been looking into hacking "pgptalk" (actually, ytalk with a popen() call to pgp and D-H key exchange) to provide the same sort of functionality for telnet.  The target platforms are SunOS (which is what netcom runs) and linux.
On first investigation, it doesn't look too hard to do the D-H key exchange stuff, as they are separated out into separate modules.  I've got the source for telnet/telnetd, and have added enhancements (like blasting out /etc/issue on connect), so I hope it won't be to difficult a Sure would be nice to be able to do it in such a way that doesn't violate ITAR.  Does anyone know if D-H key exchange qualifies as restricted under the ITAR?  I can always do a popen() to pgp like ytalk does, and let the buyer be responsible for getting their hands on PGP or a look-alike.

What does it use for key exchange?  I'd also have to hack it quite a bit to port it to linux, I think.  But if you could point me to an FTP site that has the code, I'd be willing to look at it.
Come to think of it, the last time I looked, I *did* find it on a Walnut Creek CD-ROM FTP server - but it wasn't complete, and it had no instructions for adding the DES code.  Could you refer me to a site that has the COMPLETE code, ready-to-build?

I suppose the same idea could also be used to encrypt binaries, so that the binary couldn't be tampered with and would only run on that machine.  Not a real problem to implement, really.

Then I would humbly suggest that you drop whatever service provider is
ripping you off by charging you for connect time, per-message, etc. and go
with someone like Netcom, who charges a flat fee per month.  Why pay for
Compu$erve?  It's one of the most expensive around. I pay to read what's on this list, too - but like Tim May and others, I
got wise a while back and got an account with a service provider who
charges me a flat fee for access.  I would *never* use a service much that
charged me per-hour - there are just too many out there who won't. Yes, I, too have a Compuserve account - I use it for about 10 minutes a
month, usually for figuring out airline schedules and surfing Newsgrid.
I've got this nifty expect(1) script gizmo that dials up Compu$erve, sucks
off mail and Newsgrid, then drops the connection.  I pay about $7 a month
or so.  I use Netcom for everything else, and I usually rack up around 4

Be careful with this line of reasoning.  If you market PGP to a crook for the explicit purpose of keeping his illegal activities hidden from the cops, you violate at least two different laws.

If doing activity 'A' will get the results you want, why not make 'A' happen?  Consider a successful terrorist attack against a significant group of innocents (the larger the number killed, the greater the horror and shock value).  The terrorists were using PGP-encrypted email to plan out the thing.
Now, how long do you think it would take before ALL crypto was outlawed?  Who would benefit from such a thing?  Consider that it's child's play to finance, arm, and train a group of people to conduct a terrorist attack and (conveniently) they all get killed in their attack.  No one's going to complain too loudly - after all, they *are* terrorists, right?
One wonders just how many people who went out with their AK's and shot up schools and restaurants did it because they had been financed by someone with an axe to grind against the RKBAers.  One also wonders just how long it will take before someone does the same thing to crypto.

Unless you use some sort of stego software, most encrypted stuff is pretty easy to figure out that it *is* encrypted.  grep " BEGIN PGP " message is a pretty good way to detect PGP traffic, magic numbers will tell you if it's a compressed file or not, etc.  It might not be necessary to prove what you were using to encrypt, merely proving that you *were* encrypting might be sufficient.
It's like the FCC: if they catch a ham sending out packets, and the FCC can't read them, they issue you a pink slip.  Doesn't matter what you're using, the meaning is obscured, and that's enough for them.

How about auto-moderation?  I came up with this idea a while back for
automatically moderating mailing lists.  Here's how it works:
A newsgroup is set up as moderated, and the posts are emailed to the moderator (as usual).  The "moderator" is a mail-to-news gateway that posts the articles if the author isn't on the disapproved list, and
also automatically cancels articles that don't have the right "approved"
header and aren't digitally signed by the moderator.
If a person becomes a nuisance, people send their votes in to the moderator-robot, and it tallies the votes. If within XXX days more thumbs down votes are received than thumbs up votes, the person is placed on the disapproved list.
The main advantage is, it's fast and easy to set up.  Comments?

It's not as easy as you might think.  How many anonymous accounts can you get?
There are only so many anon servers, and for each anon account you have to have
a different real account, all it buys you is your vote registers twice
instead of once.  And anonymous votes can always be blocked - since just the
vote tallies are sent out, you don't really buy anything by being anonymous.
Then that's your decision to make, but others have a different view.  I,
for one, don't want to see a bunch of inane posts from XYZ, so I put
them in my filter file to be discarded.  That will work for individuals,
but to prevent the list from being flooded by malicious users, it seems
that some sort of control would be appropriate.  Nothing would stop someone
from emailing uuencoded core dumps to the list, of course, but the first
time they did it, I think that enough people would be pissed off that they'd
vote to throw them off.  Not that they couldn't receive, they just can't
As I mentioned before, but want to make clear to you, no one individual
would be able to carry out a personal vendetta against another unless
they had a means to obtain many, many accounts and generate anonymous
accounts for each of them.  And, as I said before, anonymous votes could
be just thrown away.

I think the reason people attack the messenger is because people in the
government listen to her, and I for one am exasperated beyond words to
know that my government is paying attention to such an idiotic scheme, and
(BTW) violating every known law of security to do so.  Denning, in a very
real sense, represents the attitudes of the NSA and the people controlling
this whole scheme and trying to foist it off onto people.  Is she such an
idiot that she actually *believes* the nonsense she spouts? Is it wrong to suspect her motives, her judgement, her common sense, in
backing such a proposal?

@_subject: Barring access to Netscape 
If you want to bar access to your site from a Netscape browser, such can easily be accomplished.  If memory serves, every browser, when connecting to a site, exchanges certain information about the client with the server.  One can gain access easily to that information.
I believe that Netscape uses "Mozilla" as their keyword when exchanging browser-specific information.

If Jeff decided to leave, I don't think he'd have much trouble getting something else - I'd be surprised if he wasn't employed the next day.
Of course, if Jeff's got any stock in Netscape, he'd be nuts to leave - unless he values his principles more than he values his stock.  No insult intended.

That's one of the most politically and socially naive statements I've ever heard.  Corporations *never* do the "right thing" unless it will increase their profits.  Remember, corporations are in business to make money by providing a product or service that people will pay money for.  Whatever gets in the way of that will fall by the wayside.  That's an economic fact of life.

Well, at least it's easy and fun to program in (if you can call drag-'n-drop "coding").  Of course, until 4.0, their setup utility didn't check what version of DLL you were installing, so it's easy to get your DLLs out of sync on your system and blow your applications all to hell, and 4.0 throws all thos OLE crap in, even if you don't need/want/use OLE in your code and makes a 300K application into a 3M one, and they won't tell you what really goes on underneath the hood (I guess they're paranoid about getting ripped off), and never mind that it's almost trivial to write a VB decompiler (the .EXE is just a big jump table into offsets into VBRUN300.DLL), etc., etc., etc...
And all this from a software company that took over 10 years to make their "operating system" do preemptive *anything*.

@_subject: More FUD from First Virtual 
Nonsense.  The code is pretty solid, the interfaces aren't very difficult.  What is needed is better human management of keys.  Why brute-force, why look for weak keys, why bother calculating how much safer 2047-bit keys are rather than 1024-bit keys when someone can look on your HD and find your secret key, when they can open your desk drawer and find your pass phrase or password, when they can guess that you used your wife's maiden name as your password?
Adam, I don't understand why you wrote nonsense in the first paragraph, then followed it up with textbook attacks such as:
Moving the systems which automatically issue key revocation certificates, and coupling that with a wide distribution system would be the perfect match to such a scheme.  Of course, that means that PGP et. al. needs to be more tightly integrated into existing mail

I don't believe that that would be a consideration.  Wasn't there a court case a few years ago, in which a convicted criminal sued the government, charging that filling out one of those forms that you have to fill out when you buy a gun was a violation of his 5th amendment rights?  What ever happened to that case?
I also think that, besides the obvious 5th amendment problems, there would be a 1st amendment problem - if you "*had* to use GAK to communicate, that would be an impermissible restriction on your 1st amendment rights.

@_subject: More FUD from First Virtual 
As I understand it, the problems in the code aren't the result of the underlying algorithm being flawed, but a flawed implementation, especially in the areas of key management, RNG, and the amount of information revealed in the final encrypted product.  As far as anyone can tell (unfortunately, as BS pointed out, we don't have the mathematical tools to prove one way or the other that RSA or BBS or any of that algorithmical "stuff" is secure or not) the algorithms are secure.  The problem can almost always be traced back to either a poor implementation or poor QA/QC, something that TQM and all the current management buzzwords are going to do nothing to fix.
I wasn't referring to the user interface, I was referring to the code interface, but I'll comment on the user interface.
For most people, crypto is *hard* to understand.  If it's easy to understand, you're probably making a LOT of assumptions about key management for your user, and some of those are almost certainly going to be bad ideas - that's why PGP gives you such flexibility.  If you want to shoot yourself in the foot with PGP, Phil will certainly let you, but not without warning you first.  IMO, taking the complexity out of the key management process will almost certainly lead to designers and programmers making bad decisions about how the process should work, and that's going to lead to a whole host of problems, most of which will come home to roost at PZ's doorstep.  Yes, you and I and most people on this list know that this is bullshit, but you'd be amazed at what people will believe - witness the "ASCII virus" crap we all had to endure a few months back.  There were a lot of people who actually believed it.
I haven't found *any* PGP code that was well-integrated into anyone's mailer (including my own).  Maybe the code for Pegasus is different - I certainly hope so.
I, as well as many people, have got wrapper scripts around vi and emacs and pico that will do automatic encryption/decryption/signing for elm and pine, but that's not Windows.  If I could get my mother to use UNIX, she'd find that she can send and receive encrypted/signed email as easily as she can unencrypted/unsigned email - the back-end work has all been done for her.  The problem is, she'd rathet "do Windows" - the overall OS interface (if one can all Windows an OS) is a *lot* easier to work with and understand than UNIX is.  So, she's stuck with Pegasus and Eudora and such - and no way to do encryption and signing without having to go to a lot of I would, too... :)

@_subject: Third generation privacy 
I run a sexual abuse survivor server, in which issues like these arise almost daily.  Anonymity and privacy are very important issues for these folks - for some of them, their survival depends on it (whether or not this is a provable issue is irrelevent).  I try, as best as I can, to provide an environment that encourages trust and openness by discouraging cheating - but the fact remains that people's trust in the server and the services it provides is a function of people's trust in *me*.  It would be, as Doyle might say, "simplicity itself" to violate people's privacy by reading their email, or watching their screen as they type, and I'd like to *not* have that ability, but the fact remains, I do.
I wish it weren't so - people should be able to have a place to go whereby their anonymity and privacy can be guaranteed, without having to trust the operator at all.  Zero-knowedge protocols can help, I suspect, but the fact remains that they have to trust *me* at some point in the process, much as people have to trust the folks running First Virtual and the other people doing the digicash thing.
I think that Pegasus with PGP will go a long way towards helping.  If someone is just using the server to store encrypted email and route end-to-end encrypted packets, then I'm "out of the loop" so to speak, and can concentrate on providing a common carrier service iostead of having the risk associated with being a publisher.  Most of these folks who use my server are pretty "computer illiterate" - the fact that some of them can even log in and send email is a miracle - no slight intended.  The point is, they need a *simple* solution to that privacy problem.
By the way, there's a well-known anonymous server whose operator does *not* have the same viewpoint, and considers himself a publisher, but doesn't recognize the inherent associated risks.  To him, people are using his system, and so he has the right to "see what goes through his system."  To me, this places both himself and the people who use his server at grave risk.  He is setting himself up for a massive court fight, and they are setting themselves up to having their privacy being violated.  I'd rather not take the risk, myself, but I suppose he has nothing better to spend his money on than lawyers.

Another, not-so-obvious reason to encrypt stuff, especially stuff that goes out over the net, is that folks can suck your email off the net and gather all sorts of useful information.

You know why they want that, don't you?  So if you don't pay your bill, they can ding your credit report.  PG&E will do the same thing to you, and they will both do it illegally, without notifying you first as they are required to do by law.

@_subject: The future will be easy to use (fwd) 
I beg to differ.  Even though Larry Ellison's idea is silly, I don't see it as returning us to the mainframe model.  Rather, I see it as just a small step backwards.  Right now, I've got a 486/DX2-66 with a paltry 50 MB HD on my desk at work.  Most of its processing is done loading stuff off the LAN and running it locally.  The fact that I have a local disk nakes not the slightest bit of difference except a If the diskless workstation were to have *no* intelligence whatsoever, I'd agree with you.
As to diskless workstations being of no value, again, I'd have to disagree.  Diskless workstations, expecially X terminals that have a little NVRAM in them, have been rather popular for several years as a way to get graphical objects onto people's desks without having to shell out a ton of money in the process.  The only reason that they're getting less popular is that PC prices have fallen dramatically for the past several years, so much so that it's cost-effective to put a DX2-66 with 8 MB of RAM and a little disk (or no disk at all) on someone's desktop as opposed to something from Network General.
Me, I'm waiting for the day that someone gets clever and puts Linux into ROM. :)  Java is starting to get really hot, so much so that I was telling my spouse that if she wanted to learn Java, she'd have steady contracts in the next year or so, even in the sticks of Dallas ;)  The point is, the market for a cheap, fast PC that will run applets *is* there, or will be soon.
I only hope that they make it upgradeable, so *I* can put that 5 GB array on it, and beef up the memory without having to take a second mortgage to do it.

The only problem with this approach is that this will bite other browsers that have started supporting the so-called "Netscape extensions".  More than one person has coded the Netscape stuff into their pages because it gives the author more flexibility than the standard 1.0/2.0 standards.  And there aren't many browsers out there yet that support 3.0.

that would do the same thing.  As I recall, it calculated a simple CRC and

if the executable has been corrupted.  I've leafed through alt.sources and

@_subject: anti-tamper software 
Thanks to all who replied to my request, although it seems I didn't quite
make it clear what I was looking for.
I'm not particularly interested in a strong cryptographic solution, as this
isn't intended to detect intentional tampering - just unintentional, such
as a bad spot on a hard drive or corruption.  Turns out that Simtel has
a couple of such packages in /SimTel/msdos/virus - CVIRPROT.ZIP is enough
protection, although STEALTH.ZIP looked intriguing...
I was, however, interested in what Fred Cohen said about there being a generic
attack against such methods when applied to software protection against viruses
(virii?).  Is there such a generic attack, besides the obvious of jumping around
the detection code?  How about encrypting the executable, adding loader and
decryption code, then decrypting the executable at runtime - would that defeat
such an attack, or all such defenses doomed to failure?
