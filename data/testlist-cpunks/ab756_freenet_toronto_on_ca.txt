           GREENDOLLAR AND TIMEDOLLAR LETSYSTEM ENGINEERING
     The problem of debt is created within the banking system and therefore a thorough understanding of the banking system is helpful. The money system is the only mechanical system not under the jurisdiction of engineers. Control has been usurped by economists. All others systems improve, the only one controlled by economists is failing. It's time scientists regain control of this errant system from which come all the financial woes of the world.
     As an electrical engineer specialized in banking systems, I will endeavor to explain the inner workings of this mysterious system at every possible level and its effects on users and debt. Though this might sound daunting, I think I can present an easy way of handling subjects such as      - plumbing analogy with pipes for flows of money
     - simple algebra
     - exponential functions
     - differential equations
     - Laplace transformations
     - control system circuitry
     The two Big Lies of Economics and Banking are that:
     1) Banks lend their depositors' savings.
     2) Interest rates fight inflation;
     Banks do not lend out their depositors' funds, they lend out brand new money. Interest does not fight inflation, it causes it. HOW BANKS CREATE MONEY
     The inner workings of the engineering design of the Canadian "fractional reserve" banking system are mysterious to many but no matter how complex the actual process of creating money is, it can accurately be simplified to "HAVING THE MONEY PLATES," whether they be plates for changing metal to coins, plates for changing paper to notes, or plates inside a bank's computer changing electrical blips to bank deposits on which checks may be written.      Since changes in the money supply are regularly reported, money must enter the supply from a source and leave through sink. Our liquidity system has both a tap and a drain. Since the government borrows money itself, it does not have control of the tap. Who controls the tap and the drain of the money supply?
     The easiest way to model our system of financial liquidity is with plumbing. All banking systems have the same exterior connections to the economy.      Draw two squares side by side each. Title the first a "Piggy Bank" and the second "Chartered Bank."      For both, draw three arrows going in at the top labelled "Deposits," "Interest paid," "Loans paid."      Draw three arrows coming out from the bottom labelled "Withdrawals," "Expenses," Loans made."
     In the Piggy Bank, draw a rectangle wide enough to accept all three input flows and all three output flows. Label it "Reservoir."

     This is the mathematical circuitry behind all interest-free systems and how Greendollars work.      Instead of an output which is exponential, crooked, we have an output which is linear, straight.           Your $100 volt pulse is the input to the addition node. Added to it is old balance, starting at zero, to push the new balance up to $100 volts.      Next year, with no new pulse at the input, and with interest voltage to add, the balance stays at $100 volts. If another deposit comes in, it's added to the old balance to create a new balance. A negative coming in will reduce the old balance. But the system is always in balance. Positives equal negatives.      This analysis shows that unemployment and inflation must go to zero if the banks' computers, which are now permitted to charge both interest and service charges, are restricted to only the service      Note that the exponential derivation shows that there are two solutions to the mort-gage (death-gamble). The software solution is interest rate(i) = 0 by restricting the banks computers to a pure service charge and abolishing the interest charge. The hardware solution is time(t) = 0 by installing an instantaneous electronic cashless marketplace. GAME MODEL: SERVICE CHARGE VS. INTEREST
     In his book `The Theory of Games and Economic Behavior', John Von Neumann, one of this century's top mathematicians, stated that "important questions in economics arise in a more elementary fashion in the theory of games." In the business war for markets, the economy decides who sells their goods and who fails to. Models used by economists are flawed by guesses and approximations about what the economy will choose. The only way to perfectly model the economy is to use fair chance to pick the winners and losers.
TO PLAY MORT-GAGE:
     The necessary game equipment for "mort-gage" is 1) a box to represent the market economy); 2) 3 types of tokens to represent food, shelter, and energy (the tokens can be mints, napkins, cutlery);  3) a fair chance mechanism like a coin, cards, dice, straws, etc.; 4) matches or tokens to represent currency.
     In the Interest Game, all owe the bank 11 for every 10 tokens they borrow and have to inflate their prices to repay both the principal and the interest.
     Step 1) Have all the players wishing to get into business pledge their watches to borrow 10 matches from the bank at an interest rate.      Step 2) Have all players spend 10 matches into the market box in exchange for a token representing the product of the economy's labor.
     Step 3) Have pairs of players, those with similar tokens first, use chance to decide which will win a market share out of the box large enough to pay the principal and the interest necessary to survive the bank's demand.
     Step 4) When the market runs out of currency, let the bank seize the tokens and watches of the losers.      Step 5) Record the percent of those knocked into unemployment and the collateral seized.
     In the Service Charge Game, all owe 11 for every 11 they borrow with the 11th paid immediately to the bank employees as a service charge.
     Step 1) Have all the players wishing to get into business pledge their watches to borrow 11 matches from the bank.      Step 2) Have all players spend 11 matches into the market box in exchange for a product token, 10 for the services of those who produce the goods like on Interest Island, but also 1 for the services of the bank employees who facilitated the transactions.
     Follow Step 3), 4) and 5) and note that in the Service Charge Game, unlike in the Interest Game, everybody can sell all their goods because the 11th unit of money entered the market through the bank employees. The very subtle difference between systems is that in the Interest Game, the bank demands payment of money it did not create while in the Service Charge Game, the bank demands payment of money it did create. With exactly enough markets to match the prices of goods produced, there can be no      I hope this analysis has helped clear up many of the formerly misrepresented and misunderstood aspects of the usury banking system as well as explain why usury has been condemned throughout history as the greatest crime against humanity. It's the only thing standing between mankind and abundant salvation.
