The following article came from Duncan Campbell through a mailing list:
The debate about ECHELON - last week in the European Parliament - has
highlighted the role of the NSA station at Menwith Hill, Yorkshire.  report prepared earlier this year for the STOA (Scientific and Technical
Options Assessment) of the European Parliament resulted in widespread
coverage in Europe and the US.   We have recently made a new batch of copies of the 1993 Dispatches
documentary on Menwith Hill - "The Hill" - based on revelations based on
NSA documents obtained by women peace protesters at the Hill.   It also
covers ECHELON and other NSA activities in the UK.   Tapes (45 mins) can
ordered from :
        Ian Hide         IPTV Ltd

At ï¿½10.95 including postage.
I will e-mail trancripts of the programme free of charge to anyone
requesting it.
