Ive tried this url, it does indeed core dump.
Just had a quick look at the core.  From first impressions, it's a global
overwrite.  Therefore we're not overwriting a flushed stack frame, so a
syslog(3) style exploit is impossible.
Global overwrites can be exploited, but due to the scenario we're looking
at, I'd consider exploit chances to be very low indeed.
Let the Mystery Be, So Watcha Want, Longing In Their Hearts, Hate My Way,
M-Bike, Safari, Uncle June and Aunt Kiyoti, Daisy Dead Petals, Tuff Gnarl.
