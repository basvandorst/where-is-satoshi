The logic in this conclusion is all wrong.
The reason Hit Man, and other such "undrground" text, are not available on
the local book stores is because the major publishing houses will not
print them! Paladin Press is a mail order company because major retailers
will not shelf the books that they print. I can hardly see Paladin turning
down a 100,000 copy order from Barns & Nobel or Books-A-Million or any of
the other major chains. I am quite sure that if one looks at the records
of Paladin one will see that they sold their books to whomever wished to
purchase them (after all thet is the business they are in).
I can see it now the 1st Amendment only applies if you can sell a million
copies of your words.

I think the point they were trying to make was the data is not left in the
clear on the storage media (this is typical marketing droids at work). For practical reason data must be in the clear in memory at some point in
time. Also the data must be transferred into some type of peripheral so
the user can do somthing with the data (read text off a monitor, print a
document, listen to music, ...ect).
This is the biggest failings in these systems. Once the user has the
ability to decrypt the data the game is lost. One does not need to break
the crypto system as they give you the keys with the product!! Will this prevent John doe from giving a copy of the document to a
friend?? Nope as he will just give the friend the passphrase (or what ever
mechanism they use) along with the copy.
Will this prevent the Warez groups?? It may slow them down some but it
woun't get rid of them.
Will it stop commercial pirating?? HAH!! It will not even slow it down, a

The Left-Right paradigm is hair splitting on which topics they use in
their FUD campaigns for greater power.
Typical Left FUD
Social Security
Universal Health Insurance
"It takes a village"
Global Warming
"Gay Rights"
Blah, Blah, Blah
Typical Right FUD
Family Values
War on Drugs
Blah, Blah, Blah
Quite often camps from both the Left and the Right will come together on
various issues. This can become confusing to some and blur the lines
between the two. Once one gets past the FUD spread by members of both
groups one realizes that both groups are STATIST and SOCIALIST. All the
bickering is not over the right and wrong of Unconstitutional State
intervention into the lives of the citizens but over who gets how much of
the pie and who to steal the pie from.
In thinking over the Libertarian Party Political diamond I find it to be
quit flawed. It makes the false assumption that state intervention in
personal matters is independent from state intervention in economic
matters. The two go hand in hand. I consider the following a better
         C   G  D P R                            L
Statist -|---|--|-|-|----------------------------|--------- Anarchist
         N  C=Russin/Chineese Communism
N=German/Italian/Japanese Fascism
Positioning on the graph represents current party leadership philosophy.
Since these groups philosophies are so close you will find individual
members that will fall on either side of the parties plank but will rarely
fall very far away from it.
An intriguing side note: Libertarian != Anarchist. This is a distinction
that several members of this list have missed. Most Libertarians favor a
limited government kept on a short leash but are unwilling to go as far as
the anarchy of mob rule.

An intriguing selection of NewSpeak being used here. The forcible ending
of another humans life is wrong (add in the standard caveats for
self-defence). When it is a planed event it is called Murder. No society
in the history of mankind has permitted unrestricted murder of fellow
members of society on such superficial excuses of inconvenience.
To call this murder "choice" just doesn't pass the straight face test. It
is on the same level as calling what the Germans did to the Jews "choice".
While such superficial labeling may make it easier for you and your wife
to sleep at night it has nothing to do with the issue at hand. This is
neither a religious issue nor a left-right issue any more than theft is.
Nothing inconsistent with being a Libertarian and anti Murder.

Hmmmm well the safest answer to this is at the point of conception though
I would imagine that it is hard for most to consider a couple of cells
life. :=/
Unfortunately trying to pin an exact point after conception leads into an
endless hair-splitting debate (should it be 1 week, 1 month, 3 months,
...). The current method of considering "birth" as the defining moment is
quite arbitrary as is "viability outside the womb" as science is ever
pushing this back. Considering we are talking life and death here don't you think it would be
wise to error on the side of caution?
I think everyone here would be outraged if the State started implementing
capital punishment without being sure that the person is guilty. "Sorry we
don't know if you did it or not but what the hell we'll gas you anyway."
It should be noted that many who are against capital punishment are
against it for that very reason. I have always beleived that executions
should be public. If a society can't stomach to watch what the government
does on their behalf then the governmnet shouldn't be doing it.
I find it quite odd that a society can condone the murder of a 6mo old
child so long as it is still in the womb yet would be horrified if the
same thing was done to a child in an incubator in the neo-natal ward.
Who knows maybe the pro-choice crowd *does* approve of a doctor taking a
big pair of pliers, crushing the skull then ripping the arms and legs off
a 6mo old then pulling out the shop vac to clean up the mess?

As far as a murder FDR is responsible for more American deaths than any

Currently I believe that pay phones are treated like any other phone
number for incoming calls and billing to the customer (what money exchanes
hands between telco's is another thing). While it would be possible for
the telco to charge an inflated rate for calls to a pay phone some
mechanism would need to be in place to inform the caller that it was a
toll call (all payphones had a 999 area code as an example).

The same thing back when I was renting. I always payed in cash and did not
have a real name associated with my address. When one produces 6mo rent up

Well you can only sue the state that has caused some form of direct damage
against you. If both Texas and Alaska are doing somthing Unconstitutional
but Texas is the only one who has directly caused damage then you should
only be able to sue Texas. Even if Alaska is doing the exact same thing
unless they have directly caused damage against you there is no basis to
included them as a party in your suit. There will be exceptions to this
and one may very well have to sue each state in it's own courts if you
have greviances with more than one State. I think that in the majority of
cases one will find that a greviance will be limited to a single state (I
think it would be very rare to find a case where all 50 states had
directly caused damage against an individule).
An example of this would be back in the 50's with the forced segregation
laws. If you were living in Georga and wished to bring suit against the
state for violating your rights you would be limited to only suing Georga
even though AL,FL,SC,NC,TX,AR, all had the same laws on the books. Now you
could travel to each of those states and then have greviances against each
one but each greviance would be independent of each other and require
seperate suits against them.

against TX, you being a citizen of Texas, for complacency in these actions
of the Federal Government but they are really two seperate cases. You have
the greviance against the Fed's for violating the Constution and you have
the greviance against TX for not protecting your rights. Alaska on the
otherhand has no obligation nor right to protect you as you are neither a

Here is where you would have a gerviance against the states. Even so you

standardization of cut, paste, open, close, print makes perfect sense most
commands do not fall into this catagory. The inherent benefit of this

a program like Autocad or MathCad or even Lotus 1-2-3 where one has a
steep learning curve of specialized commands the benefits of standardized
basic commands boarders on insignificant.
Once we get past the standardization issue to the one of textmode vs GUI
(which was the topic of my original post) I doubt that one can make the
case that a draftsman running a graphics program under a textmode OS is
less efficient as his counterpart who is saddled with a bloated GUI OS. In
fact if both are operating on the same hardware I would venture a guess
that the textmode user will be more efficient by the simple fact that his
resources are not being consumed by the GUI.
The same case can be made for the accounting staff using spreadsheets or
the secretaries typing letters. I'll take an accounting department using
Lotus 1-2-3 3.x up against a similar group running MS Office and Win95/NT
any day of the week. I'll get the same work done faster and *cheaper*. Now
the MS group will have prettier reports but why should the accounting dept
be in the business of typesetting??
This brings up another issue of decreased performance with the GUI's. It
is the notion that every document must be type-set. I can't even start to
imagine the millions of man hours wasted in the office because every
insignificant memo, report, and letter has to be formatted "just right"
before it is acceptable. Now with the growing popularity of e-mail this
trend has reversed somewhat but you have companies like Netscape and
Microsoft who are eagerly trying to herd the masses back into this typeset
But I digress. :)
Another contention I have with the GUI's is the use of icons. One of the
most misused and time wasting "features" of the GUI's. It makes absolutely
no sense for someone who is working on the keyboard to stop what they are
doing, go over to the mouse, and then point and click to execute a
command. Now if you are in some type of graphics/drawing program where
most of your work is being done with a mouse already then it makes sense
but in a word processor or a spreadsheet or even a database it is highly
Well I guess I will rap this up with a final note. With the GUI OS's (and
the applications that run on them) as size and complexity increases
performance and reliability decreases. Without a doubt I can get more work

6:16pm 31.Oct.97.PST
Today's announcement " by
RSA Data Security stating that the company has formally applied to the
Internet Engineering Task Force to establish an email security standard is
a blatant lie rooted in greed, allege sources close to the process.
"RSA is lying, and I am really livid," said Paul Hoffman of the Internet
Mail Coalition. "RSA has not submitted anything."
The flap centers around the company's ongoing efforts to get its
proprietary S/MIME email encryption technology endorsed as a standard by
the task force. Such an endorsement would give the company credibility,
and potentially, an increased market share over rival Pretty Good Privacy.
PGP submitted a competing protocol for standards consideration last month.
The Internet standards process is lengthy and complicated at best. The
sticking point in RSA's efforts to date is that the task force will only
consider non-proprietary technologies for the standards track. But S/MIME
2, the protocol at the heart of the effort, includes core RSA technologies
that must be licensed.
To be considered for standardization, RSA must relinquish "change
control," or the ability to modify the technology, to the task force. And
the portion the task force is most interested in altering is the portion
that requires RSA technology. As a result, getting change control "has
been like pulling teeth," claims Jeff Schiller, the organization's
security director. "Their goal has always been get this into the IETF but don't really give
up control," said Schiller. "[They want to] make sure that when the
standard comes down, if an anyone wants to implement it then they have to
be a licensee."
Schiller says that until change control is secured, RSA has no hope of
coming near a formal application - as they had claimed to have already
done this morning. RSA, however, claims that it has granted change
"They are trying to get more market share by claiming that the IETF is
endorsing their commercial product," alleged Schiller.
RSA, in fact, is only one of five groups that have worked on S/MIME 2,
which is about to be submitted by the Internet Mail Coalition to the IETF
as an informational request for comments. Now, in order to retain its hold
on the S/MIME technology, RSA is taking sole credit for submitting it to
the task force, some observers claim.
"It's totally disacknowledging the work of a lot of other people," said
Hoffman. A request for comments is one of the initial steps in the
certification process, and Hoffman says that the Internet Mail Coalition
has yet to put S/MIME 2 forward.
Further, Schiller says, "When we do, it is not trying to get it as an
Internet standard. It won't go - and therefore we are not going to try."
Hoffman reiterated that S/MIME 2 won't be an Internet standard because it
relies on proprietary security technology and weak encryption. The
Internet Mail Coalition is about to begin work on S/MIME 3, which will use
stronger encryption and true open standards.
Tim Matthews, product manager for RSA, acknowledged that the announcement
may be open to misinterpretation. "It's basically a summation of all the
work we've been doing over the past month," he said.
Instead of helping its own cause, and gaining public mindshare, RSA's
announcement may end up flying back in its face.
"If it fragments the S/MIME camp it could help PGP a bit," said Charles
Breed, director of technology for competitor PGP.
"I hope [the announcement] hasn't sunk their chances because there are
still a lot of people who want to do S/MIME," said Hoffman. "RSA's
greediness could sink this, but I really hope it doesn't."

No it is not!
S/MIME specs require support for weak RC2/40 encryption. This is not
secure!!! Add to this the fact that to date no S/MIME vendor has ever
released their crypto source code. I for one would not trust Net$cape or
Micro$oft to secure an outhouse let alone my communications. They have
shown their incompentence in this area time and time again.

been modified for the unix beta. Will there be a release of this code??
IMHO this should have been the first thing released before the

This is not true.
If you read the S/MIME specs it says one MUST implement the RC2/40
algorithm. A MUST in an RFC has a very definate purpose: If an aplication
does not implement all MUST sections of the RFC then it is not compliant!
To create an S/MIME compliant application one MUST implement RC2/40 and
one MUST pay RSA to do so!!
This is the BIG difference between S/MIME and Open-PGP. In Open-PGP there
is no MUST to implemnet weak crypto. In Open-PGP there is no MUST to
implement propritary algoritms.
For those in the cheap seats:
- -Weak Crypto
- -Pay RSA
- -Strong Crypto
- -Don't Pay Anyone
I think that this should be simple enough for anyone here to understand.
If your Entrust product is going to be using S/MIME to communicate with
overseas users of Netscape and/or MS Outlook then you will be using RC2/40
to do so. That is the reason it is in the specs as a MUST, so MS and
Netscape can export their products!!!
Netscape, Microsoft, and RSA are letting thier greed get in the way of
developing a message encryption protocol that provides strong crypto to
ALL users.

There is an old saying in the Security Field: "Poor Security is worse than

I doubt that you would find few if any that would agree with you that it
is a good thing having the masses using weak crypto. At least the US
members of the Open-PGP group are willing to sacrifice overseas sales in
the effort to provide STRONG crypto to EVERYONE. It is the right thing to
do. I am sorry to see that you do not uderstand this. If you choose to dance with the Devil to line your pockets that is your

This is nothing but selfserving bullshit in a vain effort to justify YOUR
sellout for a paycheck.
Your product will use WEAK RC2/40 DOMESTICALLY as long as it is
communicating with someone useing these weak keys. How does your program
warn the user that the crypto being used is unacceptable?? Does it warn
them at all?? Does it refuse to use the WEAK crypto?? I know I get no
warning from NS if weak keys are being used, just the happy key to tell me
everything is ok. Do you see this as a GoodThing(TM)?? WEAK crypto is WEAK
crypto and should not be tolerated in any way shape or form. Having a minimum baseline of weak crypto is not a GoodThing(TM) it is a
BadThing(TM). If the people at Entrust can't figure that out then I have
serious question as to the security and quality of your product regardless
of the algorthims being used!!

Once you have given me the keys to unlock and display the data I can save
it, copy it, reproduce it and distribut it. To assume otherwise shows a
lack of understanding of computer systems and moderen OS's. Sure I would
need to write some software and jump through some hoops to do it but there
is nothing that your system can do to prevent me from doing so. Now wether
it is worth the effort to do so will depend on the value of the data
involved. Once you have given me the ability to display the data you have
lost the battle as I can do whatever I want with it. As far as the anonymous purchaces, no a big deal. Wan Sin Soo pays the
full $$$ amount decrypts the data, copies it and send it too his buddies
in Bangledesh. Next week there is a million copies of your data floating
around the Far-East and Wan Sin Soo is nowhere to be found. The fact that
he bought it non-anonymously is of little relevance.
digital-analog-digital is completly unnessasary.
There are. China, Russia, Eastern Europe, Far East. You have multi-million
dollar operations that all they do is pirate software, movies, music,
...ect. If the can make money pirating your data then the will do so.
I have not looked at Digibox but I have looked at Crytolope and the
technology can be defeated. All these systems do is make it hard for Joe
SixPack running WinBlows 2000 to make a couple of copies for his freinds.
For anyone determined to pirate the data this is just a minor
inconvienance just like other such schemes in the past.

You can use various "tricks" to make it more complicated but the fact
remains that at some point in time you have to present the data to the
user. Once you make this step the data can be snatched and seperated from
it's controls. Wether the effort to do this is worthwhile will depend on
the value of the data. Hogwash, you are compairing apples to oranges.
The value of money is that you can use it to purchase thing with it. A
forged copy of money is worthless because if the forgery is detected you
can buy anything with it. On the other hand a movie's value is in it's
entertainment from viewing it. I can just as easily be entertained by an
"forged" copy of snow white as well as an "official" copy. The fact that
it is a copy has not dimished it's value.

Hi Dekan,
I think that there is plenty of case law of extending constutional
protections to non-citizens. One that comes to mind were the rulings
against California inwhich the courts ruled the they were obligated to
provide schooling and social services to illegal aliens (a really fucked
rulling IMNSHO but if some good can come out of it no sense not making use
of it).

have ruled that a child (citizen or not) has the *right* to public

I'll keep searching but if anyone has a pointer to where this info can be

OK I found Plyler v Doe at:
I haven't had a chance to read through it yet.
It seems that this case is one of the main attacks against Prop 187 which
AFAIK is still in the courts.
Here is a ruling of the 9th district by Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer:
Appendix A of this ruling has the text of Prop 187.

( if there were we have plenty of bums on welfare that can fill this need)
but there is a demand for cheap votes. The current Statest have been
watching their power base erroding over the years as more and more
Americans refuse to beleive thier socialist lies. The only way that they
can continue in power is to import new voters who are easier to hoodwink
and cheaper to buy. Confermation of this policy can be seen in the
behavior of the INS durring the last election cycle where large numbers of
immigrants were naturalized before the elections.

It is not the fault of America that Mexico is the shithole that it is.
Perhaps if they were to overthrow their corrupt government and replaced it
with one based on freedom (both political and economic) there would be no
need for them to come here in the first place. California, New Mexico,
Arizona, and Texas should not be the release valve for a corrupt Mexican
government so they can continue to rape their country and leave their

note that if they had bothered to stand up against the European invaders
and defended their boarders from the begining they more then likely would
still be running the place.
"Those who fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it."
So are you suggesting we give it back? Perhaps everyone should just pack
up and go back to Europe or Asia or Africa and give it all back to the
Indians? Of course you do know that the "Native Americans" that were in
North America at the time Europeans started to colonize North America were
not the "original" humans here. There were actually several waves of
humans coming over the Siberia-Alaska land bridge over a long period of
time. I am sure that the peace loving "Native Americans" wouldn't think of
conquering lands occupied by others now would they??
Personally I could care less what they do. It's not my problem it is
theirs. It is their responsibility to fix their problems. There is no hatred or bigotry involved in my position. I am really
apathetic towards the Mexicans. They can go and do whatever they want so
long as they are not doing it here. The same goes for the Germans, French,
Ethiopians, Iraqies, Iraelies, Australians, Japanizes, et. al. I don't care what my neighbor does in his house so long as he doesn't try

In , on 11/23/97    at 01:02 AM, Tim May  said:
It is common but it is bad science. As in this study there are too many
factors that would affect the results of the survey for such a small
sample size to be accurate. One of the biggest problems is the different
results that will be acquired by taking samples for different groups. A
sample group from say the projects in Chicago will give much different
results than a sample group taken from say Lake Forest. Now multiply this
"regional" effect several times for each group that will have a
predisposition one way or another (pro or anti police). For a survey to
have an accurate representation it needs to identify and sample from each
of these groups to give an accurate overall picture.
Lets say that you have decided on a sample size of 6000 and have
identified 100 different "reginal" groups that you need to sample from.
Your sample size is now down to 60/group and this is only on one factor of
many that can cause your figures to be bias. Lets now say that you have
discovered 10 key factors per group that need to be taken into account.
Your sample size is now down to 6/group/factor. Not a very comforting
sample size for developing an accurate "global" analysis.
Now lets take into account things like how the interviewer presents
himself to the subject being questioned. A officer wearing a uniform will
get a different response than say someone in a teeshirt and bluejeans.
Then you have the actual setting that the interview is taking place. Ask
someone at the local bar what they think about the police and you will get
one answer ask them at their office with their boss in the room and you
will get a different set of responses.
The single fact that there is another person there giveing the interview
rather then say haveing the subject fill out a questionnaire privately
will bias the results. Of course having mail in questionnaire has it's own set of problems as
only a small fraction of the people will respond and the people that do
respond may bias your results because of the reasons that they have for
responding (You may have a disproportionate number of responses from
people who feel passionately on the subject one way or another).
Now that we have gotten through all of that we still have the survey
First you have to determine what questions to ask to find the answers that
you are looking for. Not as easy as this may first seem (not to mention
the issue of wether you are looking for the right answers).
Then you have to worry about how the questions are phrased.
Now you have to study what effects these will have on the various
group/factors above. While one set of questions, phraseology, environment,
and interviewer may result in an accurate result for one group a
completely different set may be needed for another group.
How the questions are phrased are only one of a large number of factors
that influence the results of such a survey. Statistical Sampling is
difficult enough in the real sciences (chem, bio, phy, ...) let alone the
pseudo-sciences like psychology and sociology.
Any such survey as the one here to be able to show an accurate picture
could happen only by chance. More than likely they could have obtained
more accurate results by sitting in a back room flipping a coin.

Well this could be done by creating a document signature and then a
collection of sub signatures but it can get ugly real quick.
What level of granularity does one use for the sub signature?
Paragraph: Contentious block of text separated by a line of white space.
Line:      Block of text ending with a CRLF.
Word:      Block of text separated by a white space.
Then what does the sub signature really tell you? Yes you can verify that
the quote was written by someone but it may be taken completely out of
context. How about when several blocks of text from different messages are
combined. Each individual block checks out but by combining them the text
has a completely different meaning than the original document.
The best thing right now is for a user to lookup the referring document in
the archives and verify the signature. It also give him the advantage of
reading the quote in its full context.
In an environment where a public archive of messages are not available
then other means of obtaining the source document are available (contact
the original author, contact the person quoting the original document). In
some environments it may be beneficial to attach the original document to
the message when sending.
Considering that a signed quote would require the Author to format his
signatures in this way I for one would not do so nor could I see a reason
for doing so.
Side Note: The above is in reference to small documents and E-Mail. In
large documents it may be desirable to sign every page or sign each
chapter in addition to signing the entire document. A case may be made for
subsignatures in a E-Mail message in which there are separate signatures
for the text of a message and accompanying attachments. In both cases
there should be a meta-signature that covers the entire document.

The user encrypts the message with his *private* key. Rather than
encrypting the entire document in one operation he would encrypt each

Say we wanted a level of granularity of a word:
word1 word2 word3 word4
the resulting cypher text would be:
cypher1 cypher2 cypher3 cypher4
Now if someone wished to verifiably quote words 1,3,4 they would include
cypher1 cypher3 cypher4 in their document.
Since cypher 1,3,4 could only be generated by original author it can be
verified that he actually wrote those words.
At a bare minimum this would have to be done on a level of granularity of
a sentance to have any meaning at all and even then it's relavance would

The ability to encrypt using multiple keys has been a feature of PGP since

Despite the flawed news reports on this matter (who would have guessed)
their is nothing covert about it. The user is both informed that this is
being done and there is a way for the user to disable it in the client.
This has been discussed before on this list and others, and few have
disagreed, that a company has a legitimate need to be able to access its
encrypted data. If employees want to send love letters or whatnot then
they should not be doing it on company time using company resources.
If a corporation wishes to establish a company policy that all
correspondence be encrypted with the companies master key it is their
right to do so and IMNSHO it would be foolhardy for them to do otherwise. Claiming that they are doing the work of Big Brother is a cheap-shot and

Economics 101; the people are voting with their wallets.
This is a prime example of the basis of socialism; envy. The socialist are
envious of the rich as they are a constant reminder of "what could have
been". "If I had only worked a little harder" ... "If I only had spent
more time in school" ... ect. After a period of time this envy turns to
jelousy and rage. "It's not fair" ... "There should be a law" ... ect.
The socialist never thinks of the hard work and personl sacrfise that goes
into creating a "Safeway" or "KMart" or "Walmart". Such companies are not
created by an act of GOD but through hard work and long hours by their
founders. While the socialist is pissing his life away on the road to
medocracy the founders of such companies, and 1000's like them, are
working 80+ hours a week building their company sometimes at the expence
of health, home and family.
After years of hard work, when the founders are finaly able to reap the
fruits of their toil, the socialist will step up and say: "I want what you
have, you can't have that because I don't" even though the socialist has
done nothing to earn it. This is the true evil of socialism: "Equiality of Outcome". While the
socialist will make a big show of his desire for "equal opertunity" it is
really "equal outcomes" that he desires. It is like the story of the
grashopper and the ant. Both have the "equal opertunity" durring the
summertime to store up for the winter. The ant choses the path of the
capitalist and works hard all sumer long while the grasshopper choses the
path of the socialist and wastes the days away in play and folly. When

plugged into your power outlets, no need to run wire to put in an extra
outlet. I believe that X-10 uses this same principle for computer control
of household appliances.
Not to mention data leakage through power lines is an issue long reconized
by the TEMPEST crowd.
The trick here seems to be in routing the data. How do you get data on the
power grid routed to the location that you want it to go??

Has anyone researched the security issues around X-10? Is the Transformer
isolation good enough protection from a dedicated attack (as opposed to
accidental signal leakage)? Are their alternative routes for transmitting
the FM signal (Airwaves) that the X-10 devices would pick up?? Do any of
the current X-10 devices use signal authentication/verification?

I beleive that this statement refers to the policy enforcement at the SMTP

That would seem possiable but you would also have to override the policy
enforcement at the SMTP server. Without examining the product I can't
comment on what mechinism they have in place.
I think that you have a mix of two things here:
1. Encryption of OUTGOING mail using both the Corporate Key and the
Recipiant Key which can be enforced by SMTP policy agent.
2. A preferance flag in the Public Key to inform the user of a public key
to also use the corporate public key when encrypting. There was
disscussion of making use of preferance flags on the Open PGP list for
things like prefered HASH & Key Use.
I would imagine that they are working from a common code base for all 3
products (shareware, commercial, and business) and merly disable/enable
the various options at compile time. I personally don't mind the code
being there as it lets me see what they are doing in the various versions
(remember Viacrypt never released their source code). I really don't see
this as a problem as it would be quite obvious if the shareware or
commercial version of PGP were adding extra recipiants to an encrypted
message (current PGP format makes this rather hard to hide).
Their seems to be alot of speculation of what PGP 5.5 does or does not do
without anyone actually examining a copy of the program and finding out.
Perhaps a few of us could obtain copys of the program and investegate it
properly. I am willing to boot into NT (shudder) to take a look.
Just as a side note there doesn't seem to be anything PGP 5.5 is doing
that I couldn't get 2.6.x to do with a weekend of codeing. The hard part,
being able to encrypt to multiple recipiants, has been in PGP since day

Well lets take the flip side of this: Who in their right mind encrypts
ultra valuable company information and then leaves the plain text on their
computer?? I have an outbox full of encrypted messages that are encrypted
to both the recipient and to my key (Encrypt-To-Self Option). If you are
going through the trouble of encryption why would you want to leave plain
text lying around??? One needs to remember that e-mail is not just
communication but communication *and* storage.
I have to disagree, see above.
I have seen no evidence that encrypting to multiple recipients is any less
secure than encrypting to one. If there are serious security implications
in doing so then it affects *all* versions of PGP and not just 5.5. I find
it odd that this issue is only now being brought up with 5.5 and never
mentioned with previous versions.
One thing I would like to see added to this set-up is secret sharing of
the corporate private key. That way one person could not unilaterally
access the data but would require the agreement of several people (say 3
of 5 department heads). I think this would provide enhanced physical
security of the key and personal privacy (Joe in IMS can't snoop the mail
just because he is board). I have made some mention of this in the past to
PGP but don't know what if any work has been done in this area. I have
been working on a small utility that would let a user do this with his own
private key. Perhaps if I ever get some free time I can finish it up.

I didn't see where Jon said that the other versions versions of PGP would
not recognize these keys. What Jon did say is that they would not generate
these keys nor force compliance with encryption to a second key. I myself
would want to know that a message encrypted with key A is also being
encrypted with key B though haveing this info in the public key itself is
not necessary.
I don't see this as a problem. My Twit/SPAM filter bounces messages
without warning. As a matter of fact most bounced messages are done so
without warning. :) This is a stereotypical Strawman. "Even if PGP avoids GAK some other 3rd
party can modify it to be Gakware." Every version of PGP had the ability
to encrypt to multiple recipients. As I stated in my previous posts I can
get PGP 2.6.x to do everything 5.5 does with a couple of scripts. Are you
no willing to take the position that ALL versions of PGP are GAK
No this is not mandatory GAK compliance. Mandatory GAK compliance would be
if every copy of PGP came with a government key and the program *forced*
the user to encrypt all his messages with it. This is really turning into
a shameless FUD campagne on your part Adam worthy of David "FUD"
Sternlight himself.
As far as I am concerned you have not proven your case that PGP 5.5 is GAK
compliant. Your general argument that PGP 5.5 has the potential to be GAK
can cover *ALL* version of PGP. Any system that allows encrypting to
multiple recipients can easily modified into a GAK system. I think this is your real issue here. You don't like the ideal of a
company haveing access to their documents. If that's how you feel then
make your case so it can be judged on it's merits.

Actually the it is the new pgp5.0 servers that are having the problems.
The PGP Inc. server may be doing ok but they are not part of the Network
(they have cut-off their connection and are not sending out nor receiving
keyring updates to the other servers).
I agree that the 100% replication can't last the number of keys and key
requests will become beyond what a PC based system can handle.
Yes but everyone's Ip's aren't changing every week. It's not just a matter
of the multitude of requests that would be required in this systems as
everyone will need to update all their keys on a weekly basis but also the
DNS records will be having this turnover. the DNS system has enough
problems as it is let alone what would happen with the implementation of
forward secrecy would cause (my best guess that within a week or two the
whole thing would crash and burn).
Even a weekly turnover of all keys would be too much.
You would have to otherwise you would run out of storage very quickly.
The best I can think of handleing the key distribution problem is to
attach a copy of your key to every correspondence and then have the client
automatically check and see if it has changed and update the keyring as
needed. If find both the automatic processing & sending the key with every
messages quite bothersome (these are PKS implementation issues that should
be covered in a different thread).
Well IMHO this scenario does not forward your cause much. If the physical
security is that bad (unrestricted access to equipment, weak passphrases,
Post-it-Notes, ...ect) then the information an attacker is looking for is
more than likely going to be available to him without messing with the PGP
keys. If the reverse is true and the physical security is strong the the
case for short-term separate keys is gone as the risk of exposure to a
long term key is greatly reduced.
I have some serious reservations of the security implications of frequent
changes to the keys. It has the potential for the user to disregard all
changes to the keys (think how quick the warning pop-ups in Netsacpe get
ignored and/or disabled by the user). The other possibility it to make the
key changes transparent to the user which I do not like at all for obvious
reasons (I do not see complete isolation of the user from the cryptosystem
as a Goodthing(TM) ).
Well I have been thinking more on this. I still am not sold that separate
keys are needed but even if they are I am inclined to believe that PGP is
not the place for them. I am leaning towards the opinion that file
encryption should be handled by the files system along with other disk
security features. This seems more appropriate than having your e-mail
client doing individual file encryption.
I do my keylookups automatically durning the msg filtering process which
is done in parallel to the message Dl's. The outbound message lookups are
a little more time consuming but is compensated by fewer keys to look for
both because fewer messages on the outbound side and the use of key caches
on the client machine for the most used keys for sig verification and
encryption. Also logging of e-mail addresses that do not use PGP cuts down
on the number of lookups needed ( I only keep trusted keys in my pubring
all others are kept in the cache for performance reasons ).

My set-up works with 2.6->5.0. It's just not persistent keys but the
ability to encrypt to multiple recipiants. Of cource even without these
features this functionality can implemented by moveing encryption to the
server. Only signing & decryption need to be on the client machines. It may even be more efficent in a corporate enviroment to do so. There are
performance questions in a high volumn enviroment but I have developed
techniques that greatly enhance the perfomance of PGP when working with
large keyrings. I know C2-Net has done work with their Stronghold product
for supporting hardware based encryption to improve performance on high
volumn servers, it would be intresting to see how well these cards would
lend themselves to PGP.
I will agree that 5.5 is an improvement but to be honest I am not that
crazy about it. Not that all of it is PGP's fault alot has to do with the
OS it runs on. NT just isn't ready for prime time. I have my own GUI I

3rd: I never said I liked CMR or that I thought it was the best solution.
What I do believe it was the best solution available at the time. They
were able to provide a "solution" for their customers in a timely fashion
with little modification to their exisisting codebase. This was a
migration path for their customers from Viacrypt 4.0. One of the thing
they needed to get some customers away from was key escrow. Remember now
Viacrypt is RSA, signing & decryption are the same key. Escrowing these
keys is a BadThing(TM). Sure eventually they will migrate to the DSS/DH
keys but as I am sure you are aware chage is a slow thing in a corporate
4th: I most definatly do not believe that CMR=GAK or is anywhere close to
it. The sky is not falling chicken little, it's only rain :)

engine that is suited to their needs. Betreve doesn't try to develop every

                             Abstract
There are two ways of attacking smartcards - destructive reverse engineering of the silicon circuit (including the contents of  ROM), and
discovering the memory contents by other means; a well  equipped
laboratory can do both. Persistent amateurs have often  managed the
latter, and may shortly be able to do the former as  well. 1 Reverse engineering the chip
A recent article[1] gives a good introduction to how reverse  engineering
can be carried out in a moderately well equipped  academic
microelectronics laboratory (there are three such in the  UK, and perhaps
two hundred academic or industrial facilities  worldwide which can carry
out such work). We will start off by  summarising it and giving some
background. 1.1 How attacks are done
The authors of the article cited above worked at the Cambridge  University
microelectronics lab, which is part of the department  of physics. They
got interested in reverse engineering chips five  years ago to help an
industrial client locate manufacturing  defects. They built an apparatus which consists of a slightly modified  electron
beam lithography machine (this functions in effect as an  electron
microscope) and a PC with an image processing system (a  DCT chip and
locally written software). They then developed  techniques for etching
away a layer at a time without doing too  much damage. Conventional wet
etching causes too much havoc with  half micron chips, so dry etching is
used in which gases such as  CF4 or HF strip off layers of silica and
aluminium in turn. One of their innovations is a technique to show up N and P doped  layers
in electron micrographs. This uses the Schottky effect: a  thin film of a
metal such as gold or palladium is deposited on  the chip creating a diode
effect which can be seen with the electron beam. Finally, image processing software has been developed to spot the  common
chip features and reduce the initially fuzzy image of the  metal tracks
into a clean polygon representation. There are also  routines to get
images of successive layers, and of adjacent  parts of the chip, in
register. The system has been tested by reverse engineering the Intel 80386  and a
number of other devices. The 80386 took two weeks; it takes  about six
instances of a given chip to get it right. The output  can take the form
of a mask diagram, a circuit diagram or even a  list of the library cells
from which the chip was constructed. This is typical of the kind of attack which an academic lab can  mount.
Even more sophisticated attacks, invented at Sandia  National laboratories
and recently published[2], involve looking  through the chip.
Light-Induced Voltage Alteration is a non-
destructive technique that involves probing operating ICs from  the back
side with an infrared laser to which the silicon substrate is transparent. The photocurrents thus created allow  probing of
the device's operation and identification of logic  states of individual
transistors. Low-Energy Charge Induced  Voltage Alteration relies on a
surface interaction phenomenon  that produces a negative
charge-polarization wave using a low-
energy electron beam generated by a scanning electron microscope.  This
allows imaging the chip to identify open conductors and  voltage levels
without damage, although it does not operate  through metalization layers.
Of course, even more sophisticated techniques may be available in classified government facilities. 1.2 The threat to smartcard systems
Smartcards typically have a few kilobytes of ROM, which being  metal can
be read with the above techniques; a few hundred bytes  of RAM, which
being cleared between transactions stores no long  term secrets; and a few
kilobytes of EEPROM, which typically  holds the user data and key
material. The techniques described above are not directly relevant to reading out EEPROM. However any laboratory at the level under consideration would be able to determine EEPROM contents using  microprobe
techniques. More simply, a reverse engineering operation would pinpoint the physical location of the write protect bit, which could then be reset using ultraviolet light. As mentioned, the number of organisations worldwide which can do  electron
beam lithography is of the order of 100-200. These potential attackers include a number of universities, all the big  chip
makers and the governments of the USA, Canada, the UK and  China. Of
these, the US and Chinese governments appear to have  the greatest
experience at chip breaking. For a respectable firm to join this club costs about $2m - $1.5m  for the
electron beam lithographer and ancilliary equipment, plus  a year's salary
for about five professionals to get it all going  (typically a physicist
to deal with the ion beams, a chemist to  deal with packaging, two
computer people to write software, and a  chip person to run the whole
operation). The number of club members may rise as more and more firms, especially in the Far East, start producing ASICs. However it is  not
likely that electron beam lithography will ever become a  really
widespread technology. The total number of sites with the  capability to
do regular hi-tech attacks might rise to about 1000  at most. An outsider without $2m still has a number of options. For ex-
ample, there are three universities in the UK alone which possess  the
necessary equipment (Cambridge, Edinburgh and Southampton)  and an
attacker might enrol for a PhD or other degree in order to  acquire access
and training. It is also possible to use more  primitive equipment at the
cost of spending months rather than  weeks on each reconstruction; this is
apparently the approach of  the Chinese government, and could be viable
where workers are  paid little (or are expecting a share of large criminal
profits). Finally, there are apparently places in the Far East, and at  least one in
Silicon Valley, which reverse engineer chips for  cash. How much cash, and
how many questions would be asked, are  not known to this writer. 1.3 Possible defences
A number of copy trap features are incorporated into commercial  chip
designs. For example, we have heard of design elements that  look like a
transistor, but are in reality only a connection  between gate and source;
and 3-input NORs which function only as  2-input NORs. Many of these copier traps are based on holes in isolating layers  or on
tricks done in the diffusion layer with ion implantation  (based on the
assumption that it is hard to distinguish N from  P). However the layer
etching and Schottky techniques developed  by Haroun Ahmed's team can
detect such traps. Another possibility is to introduce complexity into the chip  layout and
to use nonstandard cell libraries. However the chip  still has to work,
which limits the complexity; and nonstandard  cells can be reconstructed
at the gate level and incorporated in  the recognition software. Finally, in the Clipper chip there are a number of silicon features, of which the most important is a fusible link system.  These
links are only fused after fabrication and hold the long  term key and
other secret aspects of the chip. Details can of  course be found in a
paper in the relevant data book[3], and from  the scanning electron
micrographs there, it is clear that the  secret information can be
recovered by sectioning the chip. This  technique has been used by
Professor Ahmed's team on occasion on  obscure features in other chips. Thus the effect of current silicon level copy traps is just to  slow down
the attacker. In fact, we have heard from a usually  reliable source that
Intel has reverse engineered the Clipper  chip, but that the results have
been classified. The same appears to be the case for chemical measures. Chips  intended for
classified military use are often protected by passivation layers of a tenacity never encountered in civilian packaging[4]. But here again, informed sources agree that with  enough
effort, techniques can be developed to remove them. 1.4 Relevance to smartcard products
We understand that neither silicon copy traps not advanced passivation techniques are used by smartcard manufacturers in the  bulk of
their products. The marketing director of a smartcard  manufacturer said
that they simply had no demand from their users  for anything really
sophisticated[5]. The most that appears to be  done is an optical sensor
under an opaque coating[6]. Hi-tech techniques may indeed have been used by commercial pirates to duplicate satellite TV smartcards[7]. Recent postings to a TV hackers' mailing list recount how an undergraduate used nitric acid and acetone to remove ICs intact  from
Sky-TV smartcards; he then put them in the University's  electron beam
tester (an ICT 8020, also sold as the Advantest E  1340 - a 1991 machine).
The chips were run in a test loop, but he  had been unable to remove the
silicon nitride passivation layer;  the many secondary electrons removed
from this caused it to get  charged positive very quickly, which obscured
the underlying  circuit. He did not have access to a dry etching facility
to  remove this layer, and could get no further. However it is significant that a person with no funding or specialist knowledge  could
get even this far. However, amateur hackers have managed to break smartcard security  without
having to penetrate the device physically. Instead, they  have used flaws
in the design of the card's hardware or software  to determine its
contents. 2 Determining the EEPROM contents
Many methods have been employed to determine the EEPROM contents  of
smartcards. In addition to the very general reverse  engineering
techniques described above, there are a lot of  shortcut attacks on
particular designs. 2.1 How attacks are done
The following list is not exhaustive: o   raising the supply voltage above its design limit; o   cutting the supply voltage below its design limit; o   resetting random memory locations using ultraviolet light     until the read protect bit is found; o   exploiting misfeatures in the hardware, including the     manufacturer supplied ROM code; o   exploiting misfeatures in the customer written EEPROM code     (current attacks on UK satellite TV systems take this route); o   some combination of the above. The appendix contains accounts from a hacker mailing list of two  actual
attacks carried out on chips. 2.2 Threat assessment
All systems have bugs, and so the level of threat to smartcard  systems
presented by exploitable loopholes is a function of how  many bugs remain
(i.e. how mature the design is) and how much  effort is spent in looking
for them (i.e. how many motivated  attackers there are). This in turn
depends on the application  area. Satellite TV systems attracted a great many attackers for historical reasons; in the USA, many rural households had got  into the
habit of watching satellite TV feeds as there were no  terrestrial
stations in range, even although these feeds were  intended for
rebroadcast rather than direct consumption. When the  feeds were
encrypted, the families who depended on them for their  news and
entertainment - and often could not buy decoders through  any legal
channel - were outraged. In Europe, a similar problem arose when the final season of 'Star  Trek:
The Next Generation' was encrypted. This program's fans  included many
with appropriate skills, and soon (March 94) there  appeared a program
called Season which decoded Sky TV. Since then, there has been a battle of wits between Sky and the  Trekkies,
which has probably cost Sky somewhere between $10 million and $100 million. On May 18th 1994, Sky changed from  issue 07
cards to their new issue 09 card. Hackers refer to May  18th as Dark
Wednesday. The 09 card proved harder to hack but a  temporary solution
appeared in June. It only lasted a few weeks  before Sky changed codes
again. Though some attempts at an issue  09 Season were made, a code
change by Sky stopped it until just  before Christmas. Then no less than three new versions of Season appeared - two for  the PC
and one for the MAC. Successive code changes on January  4th and January
25th led to further updates of Season, and by  about 8th March all the
secrets in the Sky 09 card were known -  and published! Hackers are
awaiting the release of series 10 Sky  cards with relish. In addition to the attacks on satellite TV, there have been a  number of
attacks on banking systems and prepayment electricity  meter systems which
are documented in three of my recent papers  [8, 9, 10] Most of the
attacks documented there resulted from  similarly opportunistic
exploitation of design and operational  errors, and some of the target
systems were based on smartcards. Finally, some concern has been expressed that attack skills may  be
transferable. For example, a banking industry security expert  is worried
that the satellite TV hacking community might next  turn its attention to
eftpos systems. 2.3 Possible defences
The main conclusion to be drawn from the above is probably that  just as
we do not know how to make a device which resists tampering by a funded organisation, we do not know how to build a  device
of any complexity to resist logical as opposed to physical  tampering. There are a number of other lessons. For example, companies which  rely on
smartcard systems should if possible avoid making a lot  of enemies.
Diversity of attack has been significant in pay-TV,  metering and banking
systems and just as a funded organisation  can break the silicon directly,
so one must expect that many  tinkering amateurs will eventually find a
flaw in any piece of  software. It is well known in the software testing
community that  a significant number of bugs come to light when a piece of
software is passed on to another tester or to a customer; this is  because
different testers and/or users exercise different parts  of the input
space[11]. It is also imprudent to start off with weak security and then  improve it
gradually in response to attacks. The satellite TV  people did this, and
trained up a community of hackers. At some  point, you must invest enough
to put clear water between your  systems and your opponents, and the
sooner you make this  investment the smaller it is likely to be. The main investment should be in getting the overall design right, or at least as right as one can, from the beginning. It is  unwise
to spend a lot of money on tamperproofing while ignoring  the much simpler
and dirtier attacks which exploit errors in  design and operation. Quality
control, and examination by multiple independent experts, should take priority over attempts  to mimic
the passivation techniques used by the military. After all, the three published attacks on Clipper all involve the  logical
design (key management protocols and modes of operation)  rather than
penetration of the device itself. 3 Conclusion
At present, there are no portable tamperproof devices. If secrets  are
held on smartcards which are allowed outside protected  spaces, then both
physical and logical attacks should be expected. The scale of such attacks will depend on many things. If there is  a
capable motivated opponent, such as a chip maker or the  government of a
NATO country or China, then it must be assumed  that a complete
penetration will take at most weeks. If there are  many less capable but
still motivated opponents, then penetrations based on the opportunistic exploitation of design  flaws are
to be expected in due course. We conclude that systems based on portable tamper-resistant devices should be designed with caution. They should avoid motivating a determined attack on the cards, and the penetration  of a
small number of cards should not be fatal to the system  owner. These considerations interact; for example, if the scope of secrets kept within the card is limited so that breaking a card  allows
access to only one bank account, then it is unlikely that  an attack would
be economic to an attacker or prove more than a  minor nuisance to the
card issuer.                              APPENDIX
First account
This short essay will show you how to read the EPROM of an AMD87C51, with all security programmed. .... the SM-card I had was programmed with both Lock bits and it  was
impossible to read out the IROM. But the data sheet also tells:     To ensure proper functionality of the chip, the internally     latched value of the EA pin must agree with its external     state. Perhaps it was possible to confuse the processor. I build a small device with external EPROM (64KBytes) and RAM.  The EPROM
was coded with a monitor program in the upper address  range which gives
me the possibility to load and execute code by  control of a PC. Starting
the processor with external ROM access  disables the access of the
internal ROM and due to the latching  of the EA pin during RESET, changes
at the EA pin had no effect.  Also the MOVC returns only external ROM
values. Know my idea was to start the processor with internal ROM and  then to
confuse him so that he accesses the external EPROM and  run into the
monitor program. I tried ...
But reduction of the power supply voltage works. At about 1,5  Volt the
processor starts to access the external ROM. Rising the  voltage back to 5
Volt the processor (most of the times) still  run external, but with the
possibility of access to the internal  ROM... I programmed a small routine, which calls an address within the  internal
ROM and execute this. I started at the higher end of the  internal ROM and
decreased the calling address with each try by  10h. Most of the time the
processor hangs up. But at some addresses I got a return to the monitor program. So I analysed  this
addresses and prepared the registers in a way to verify that  the routine
could read ROM data. And I found the routine which  did this. So the
internal ROM code reads itself and returns  himself to the monitor program
for storage. It took about 3 days  to go through the ROM and find the
routine and one long week to  understand the code. Second account
This short story shows how to get access to a secured 87C51 microcontroller. It's a different way, than the one described by  .....
Referring to his article, I assume, that this 87C51  microcontrollers and
their features (including security bits) are  known. The idea was, that the security bits are not located near the  EPROM array
on the silicon. After some tests in erasing standard  EPROMS, I had the
right tools to try it on a real device: With a  mask designed from black,
thick paper with a small hole in it, I  started to lighten the silicon on
the outer edges and sides.  Moving the mask carefully and checking the
security bits (by  reading the device in a microcontroller programmer)
after each  try is a long job. I did additional tests to open the chip (by
 removing the windows or dividing the ceramic carrier material).  But this
always led to permanent damage to the chip (broken silicon, destroyed wires between pads and pins), so I gave this  up. So
after 4 destroyed chips the fifth was the right one. You  have to be sure,
that your mask is good prepared and the erasing  light doesn't diffuse
across the chip. No I'am able to erase such  a device in less than 10
minutes. But ... it's only easy if the  device is one of AMD or Philips.
The Intel devices have a window,  which is formed like a lens (the silicon
looks very big). On this  devices it's nearly impossible to lighten a
specific part of the  silicon. The job is easier on devices with standard
window and a  _big_ EPROM Array (seems to be devices aged two or more
years).                                          . . . if somebody is  interested
in the 4K codes of the MasterCard (bad and dirty code)  or MovieCard (very
elegant algorithm and i/o implementation),  just gimme' a direct mail.

@_subject: Who Is A Libertarian? 
Well there has been some talk on the list of what libertarianism is and
what it stands for including an unfounded attack by Jim Choate worthy of
Kent Crispin.
For your enjoyment and education I shall once again quote from Dean
Russell with a piece he wrote in "Ideas on Liberty", May 1955: "Who is a
    Those of us who favor individual freedom with personal responsibility
have been unable to agree upon a generally acceptable name for ourselves
and our philosophy of liberty. This would be relatively unimportant except
for the fact that the opposition will call us by some name, even though we
might not desire to be identified by any name at all. Since this is so, we
might better select a name with some logic instead of permitting the
opposition to saddle us with an epithet.
    Some of us call ourselves "individualists", but others point out that
the opposition often uses that word to describe a heartless person who
doesn't cars about the problems and aspirations of other people.
    Some of us call ourselves "conservatives", but that term describe many
persons who base their approval of an institution more on its age than on
its inherent worth.
    Many of us call ourselves "liberals". And it is true that the word
"liberal" once described persons who respected the individual and feared
the use of mass compulsions. But the leftists have now corrupted that
once-proud term to identify themselves and their program of more
government ownership of property and more controls over persons. As a
result, those of us who believe in freedom must explain that when we call
ourselves liberals, we mean liberals in the uncorrupted classical sense.
At best, this is awkward and subject to misunderstanding.
                        A GOOD AND HONORABLE WORD
    Here is a suggestion: Let those of us who love liberty trade-mark and
reserve for own use the good and honorable word "libertarian".
    Webster's New International Dictionary defines a libertarian as "one
who holds to the doctrine of free will; also, one who upholds the
principles of liberty, esp. individual liberty of thought and action."
    In popular terminology, a libertarian is the opposite of an
authoritarian. Strictly speaking, a libertarian is one who rejects the
idea of using violence or the threat of violence-legal or illegal-to
impose his will or viewpoint upon any peaceful person. Generally speaking,
a libertarian is one who wants to be governed far less than he is today.
    * A libertarian believes that the government should protect all
persons equally against external and internal aggression, but should
otherwise generally leave people alone to work out their own problems and
   While a libertarian expects the government to render equal protection
to all persons against outright fraud and misrepresentation, he doesn't
expect the government to protect anyone from the consequences of his own
free choices. A libertarian holds that persons who make wise choices are
entitled to enjoy the fruits of their wisdom, and that persons who make
unwise choices have no right to demand that the government reimburse them
for their folly.
    * A libertarian expects his government to establish, support, and
enforce the decisions of impartial courts of justice - courts which do not
recognize or refer to a person's race, religion, or economic status. If
justice is to be rendered, the decisions of these courts must be as
binding upon government officials and their actions as upon other persons
and their actions.
    * A libertarian respects the right of every person to use and enjoy
his honestly acquired property - to trade it, to sell it, or even to give
it away - for he knows that human liberty cannot long endure when that
fundamental right is rejected or even seriously impaired.
    * A libertarian believes that the daily need of the people can best be
satisfied through the voluntary processes of a free and competitive
market. And he holds the strong belief that free persons, using their own
honestly acquired money, are in the best possible possible position to
understand and aid their fellow men who are in need of help.
    * A libertarian favors a strictly limited form of government with many
checks and balances -and divisions of authority- to foil the abuses of the
fearful power of government. And generally speaking, he is one who sees
less, rather than more, need to govern the actions of others.
    * A libertarian has much faith in himself and other free persons to
find maximum happiness and prosperity in a society wherein no person has
the authority to force any other peaceful person to conform to his
viewpoints or desires in any manner. His way of life is based on respect
for himself and for all others.
    * A libertarian doesn't advocate violent rebellion against prevailing
governments - except as a last resort before the concentration camps. But
when a libertarian sees harm rather than good in certain acts of
government, he is obligated to try his best to explain to others who
advocate those measures why such compulsory means cannot bring the ends
which even they desire.
    * The libertarian's goal is friendship and pease with his neighbors at
home and abroad.

    The fact that government "officials" would use their power to extort

    Why they were allowed to get away with it is the interesting part.
    There is an underlying hatred of success in this country. The vast
majority of Americans loath anyone who has done better for themselves than
they have (better know as the sin of envy). This was not always the case.
At one time Americans had hopes and dreams of success. They always
believed that no matter how poor or uneducated they were their children
could find themselves on top ("Yes Johnny, someday *you* can be
President"). They understood that it was the equality of opportunity that
made this country great. That if a man, through hard work and a little
luck, could take his destiny into his own hands and become anything he
    This is no longer true. Through decades of socialist control of the
education and entertainment industries Americans have lost the dream. They
no longer believe that their destinies are in their own hands. Rather than
looking to themselves for the solutions to their problems they look to
government. Rather than blameing their own sloth and ignorance for their
lot in life they blame those who are still willing to strive and succeed.
    Such attitudes are most prevalent among those who need to strive the
hardest. They blame the "establishment", and "angry white men", for their
plight, never once acknowledging their own complacency. When uneducated
immigrants come to this country, unable even to speak the language, and
through hard work and perseverance are able to succeed how can any
legitimacy be given to the claims of the socialist?
    Proof is all around that America is still a land of opportunity. All
one has to do is look to people like Bill Gates, who without benefit of
education or wealth, made himself one of the richest men in the world.     Millions of people immigrate to America as they know what
opportunities are here for them. They are not immigrating to Europe, or
Russia, or China, or Cuba because they can see what socialism has made of
these places. Unless Americans wakeup and take notice of the bankruptcy of
the victim mentality of socialism their lot in life will never improve.

I will not be using digital signatures for anything other than

Several things here:
1. HTML in mail:
There is just no place for this crap in e-mail. If multipart/alternative
is used it is tolarable but pure text/html messages go into the bitbucket
with a autoreply explaining to the poster the error of their ways. :)
I was pleasently suprised that MS Outlook actually makes use of the
multipart/alternative format (M$ actually got it right for once). Net$cape
does not and will blindly send out text/html messages (after all everyone
uses a web browser to read their mail) and Eudora was doing the same thing
though they may have fixed this (I talked to John about this when I was at
the IETF in DEC).
2. AutoProcessing of Attachments:
This is *allways* a BadThing(TM). Not only is it an obvious security risk
it is a PITA for the user. I would be rally pissed if my mailer launched a
V-Card app everytime someone thought it was a GoodThing(TM) to add these
attachments to every message they sent out.
3. AutoDownloading of Data:
I imagine what happend here is the internal logic for N$ mailreader when
processing a html/text e-mail message is to treat it just like a WebPage
and processes it accordingly.
IMHO a mail client that is going out to an external site to DL data wether
it be part of a html/text message or Message/External-Body the mailer
should prompt the user on wether or not he wishes to retreive the data.
My recomendations is to dump the Netscape garbage and get a real e-mail
client. Netsacpe has done a good job at screwing up the web we really
don't need the same favor from them with e-mail.

This is really much todo about nothing and shows a complete lack of
understanding of Trademark laws.
Trademarks are product specific, there is nothing preventing preventing
two companies from having the same name provided they are not in the same
business. You can even have two companies with the same name in the same
business provided that the likelyhood of mistaking one company for another
is small.
Some examples:
It is perfectly legal to have a company name IBM (the computer company)
and another company called IBM (a local auto repair shop in Podunk, AK).
It is also legal to have two companies called Widgets both making widgets
provided that both were operating in different regions (Widgets  only
operated in NewEngland while Widgets  only operated in Texas).
Trademarks not only involve company names but also include product names.
A good example of this is Intel and the naming of thier CPU's. The courts
ruled that they could not trademark a Number (286,386,486,...) an this is
the reason for the Pentium(TM) name for their chips which is
trademarkable. Even so there is nothing preventing McDonalds from calling
thier new burger the Pentium as no one should mistake a burger for a CPU
(well except for some windows users ).
Now understanding that even when one Tradmarks a name it does not give you
exclusive use of the name how does one apply trademarks to a domain name?
Should  be the exclusive domain of Microsoft just because
they have a program with that name? What about a window manufacture
shouldn't he have an equal if not greater claim to that domain (after all
his whole business is windows)? Which windows manufacture? Should ABC
Windows have that claim or Billy-Bob's Windows Imporium? Should the
trademark claim extend to all possible domains? (
 I haven't even touched on the international issues. Should a company from
one company have the ability to enforce it's trademark claim to all
domains world-wide?
I fear that this is just another example of the Government trying to get
it's sticky fat fingers on another portion of the net not to mention yet
aother shoddy piece of journalism (calling it that give too much credit to
the author).
Just for the slow ones out there it is perfectly legal for me to open a
computer store, call it Buger King and call my computer system the Wopper.

Well the polotics of the middle east and the history of the Jews both in

it out to be.
I find it quite intresting how members will bemone the plight of the
Plaistinians in Israel yet no one ever mentions the fact that 80% of the
population of Jordan is Palistinian. Nor do they mention the reasons *why*
the PLO was operating out of Lebanon in the 70's and early 80's (for those
of you who don't know it's because they tried to overthrow the government
in Jordan and the King sent the troops out to slaughter them.) Nor is
there any mention that historically there was never any county of
Palistine until the British created it out of what was known as
Trans-Jordan which again was a creation of the British after the defete of
the Ottoman Empire (the Turks for the less informed) durring WWI. Lets not
forget that the British promised both the Jews and the Palistinians their
own country (unfortunatly they promised them both the same peice of land).
And god forbid no one ever mentions the fact that the UN created both a
State of Israel and a State of Palistine in 1945 and the Palistinians
rather than declare thier independence and form a governemnt joined with
the rest of the Arab states in going to war against the Jews currently
living in Palistine. They then were promptly handed their asses by the
Israelies *without* help from the British or the US (as an intresting side
note it was the Russians who were the first to reconise the State of
Israel not any of the western governments).
Now some may wish to extend the lame argument that the British didn't have
the right to carve up the middle east nor did the Jews have the right to
immegrate to Israel. Well the simple fact of the matter is that *every*
country in exsistance today has been created by one group of people
conquering another. All the countries of North *and* South America were
formed that way. The empires of the Incas and Aztecs were formed the same
way. The various tribes of North America gaind control of their "huntting
grounds" by taking them away from those that were there before.
So wine and cry all you want about Israel and the Evil Zionist but they
have the strongest military in the area (and one of the best skilled in
the world) and they have a shitload of Nukes. They ain't going anywhere
with or without any help from the US. (for those of you silly enough to
think the US should force them out or let the Russian backed Arabs do the
job I sugest a reading of the Masada Plan).

Well before the Israel war of Independence no one was kicked off their

their own land. Those who migrated there durring the 1st half of the

land that was fallow. Much of the current farmland in Israel was not
stolen from the Arabs but came from swamps that were drained and deserts
that were irrigated (much of Israel was either swamp or desert before the
Jewish Immigration started).
The plight of the plaistinians after 1945 is known as the "spoils of war"
and since the palestinians were the *aggressor* I have no simpathy for
them (ya pay your money ya take your chances).
 It is really no surprise that so few Americans have any

Kindergartner arrested in school scuffle
By Sonja Lewis and Lesley Conn
New Journal Staff Writters
    Her daddy told her it was like finger-painting, but 5 yaer-old
Chaquita Doman was actually being fingerprinted following her arrest
Wednesday and it wasn't fun.
    The Edgewater Elementary kindergarten student was booked on a felony
battery warrant at the Department of Youth Services after scuffling with
her school counselor. Linda green, 51, told Escambia deputies Chaquita bit
and scratched her Feb. 3 when she tried to calm the girl. The warrant for
battery of an elected official or educator was issued the day of the
    Escambia deputies have never arrested anyone younger, a spokeswoman
    Chaquita's father, Lee Ernest Middleton, said the arrest is the most
ludicrous thing he's ever experienced.
    District spokeswoman Barbara Frye said school officials were making
sure a child with "an-out-of-contorl rage" got some counseling.
    Deputies notified Chaquita's parents Tuesday of the arrest warrant.
Her parents brought her in Wednesday.
    "Can you imagine what it's like to have your daughter fingerprinted
and escorted by a deputy to a juvenile facility?" asked her father.
    Middleton, 35, said he plans to contact a lawer as early as this
morning because of the emotional trauma suffered by his daughter and her
identical twin sister, Shakita.
    He took his daughters out of school Thursday.
    Missing four of her front teeth, Chaquita nodded Thursday that she bit
and scratched someone. "She's good", she said tossing her thumb towards
her twin. "I'm bad".
    Chaquita threw furniture and inflicted at least 27 deep scratches and
bit Green's arm to cause "significant bleeding," Frye said.
    Chaquita was suspended for three days and her parents were asked to
sign a counseling referral slip, Frye said. Because Green wanted the child
to be councled, she called deputies.
    Middleton says he was not asked to sign anything until her suspention
was up. He said he agreed to counseling.
    Because of juvenile protection laws, the State Attorney's Office could
not say what action was taken. But her parents were told there would be no
charges filed, they said.

The point I was trying to make, and you seemed to have missed, is that
just because you turn off the switch and the lights are not flashing and

Take the following into account:
1) Location Tracking via Cell Phone is currently available using equipment
in place.
2) FCC mandates for Location tracking under the cover of 911 service
3) In field testing being done in several cities.
4) Lojack systems in place in several cities.
5) Systems in development for continuous traffic monitoring in the major
cities for automated traffic management to address the problems of "rush
hour" traffic.
6) GPS systems being built into productions vehicles at the factory.
It seems only natural to merge these into one piece of equipment using one

Shareware is not a bad alternative. Thoses who like your programs and are
intrested in supporting your efforts are usally willing to spend a couple
of bucks. I wouldn't plan on quitting your day job but if your code is
popular it can help offset expences.
Another approach is to do what Phil did with PGP. Freeware to individules
and pay for business use. This depends on whether there is a business need
for your programs or not.
Get a job at a University. :)
If you really had somthing intresting that you were planning on doing you
may be able to get some type of research grant.

If we need anything in this country it is a good supply of hemp rope so
whenever one of these control freaks tries to wipe their ass with the

dragged out by their heals and lynched on the spot!!
If they are so anxious to "save the children" why don't they ban all
automobiles? I don't have exact figures but I am sure 1,000's of children
die and 10,000's are injured every year in auto accidents. I am sure that
Detroit and the oil industry might have a few words against it not to
mention 100 million angry motorist.
And if they really want to save some children why don't they shut down the
multi-billion dollar infanticide industry known as abortion. Why are these
medical hacks allowed to do to children what they would be jailed for
doing to a dog? Perhaps because it serves nicely with the elitist goals of
population control (need to keep the number of niggers, bean pickers, and
white trash down to a controllable number) not to mention that their
pockets are well lined by the hacks.
If they were truly operating on moral principals one would think they
would go after that which causes the greatest harm to the most children.
But of course they don't. They have no more morality than a bitch in heat.
Their "save the children" bit is just a pre-emptive trump against any

Bunk, their are numerous laws that tell others what they can or can not
do. It is illegal to steal, it is illegal to commit murder. The fact they
you may be stealing from someone else or trying to kill someone else does
not make it any less illegal (and immoral). Every human has basics rights;
the right to life being the cornerstone of those rights.
I think it quite acceptable for someone to incur risks while in the act of
commiting murder up to and including their own death. As far as the
practitioners of murderer for profit they are no better than the Nazi's
gassing the Jews.
Yes their is, a dead one. I suggest you talk to some "unwanted",
fatherless children and ask them if they would rather be dead (not to
mention die a quite painful and barbaric death). I think you will find
that few of them share your opinions on the matter.
 I really didn't want this to turn into an abortion debate. I was
just trying to show the hypocrisy of the "save the children" crowd.

10/12/98- WebTV is watching you
Microsoft Corp.'s WebTV Networks Inc. is quietly using a system-polling
feature that can extrapolate subscriber information from each of its
450,000 users to better serve advertisers, said Steve Perlman, president
of WebTV. The polling, which takes place nightly, uploads television and Web site
viewing habits back to the system. The data makes it possible for WebTV to
scrutinize not only what subscribers are watching, but also what they are
clicking on or surfing away from, Perlman said. The polling results are
offered to advertisers in an aggregate format;  however, because results
are grouped by ZIP code and contain demographic data compiled from WebTV
viewers' polls, it can help them target ads more effectively. "We have a whole department that does nothing but look at the information.
If someone is watching a car ad and clicks through, we can send them to
the closest car dealership Web site," Perlman said.  "The balance is
providing advertisers with useful information while still protecting the
subscribers." WebTV already protects its subscribers from Internet cookies

What the Arabs have attempted to do is finish the job the Nazi's started.

Both the Palestinians and the Jews living in Trans-Jordan wanted their own
country. The UN resolution divided up the land based on population and
gave each group their own country. Israel declared their independence, the
Palestinians listened to the Grand Mufti and join in the holy war to wipe
out the Jews. The Arabs lost, too bad, game over.
And interesting note to the whole palestinian "issue" is that the majority
of the population of Jordan is palestinian!! And long before the Intifada
the PLO tried to take over the government of Jordan and were embroiled in
civil war for most of the 60's and early 70's. The Jordanian Arabs finally
kick the PLO out in the early 70's (71 maybe 72).
This re-wright of history might give you warm fuzzies but no one was moved
at gun point off their land (at least not until the Arabs started the
war). The Jews that emigrated to Trans-Jordan/Palestine *purchased* the
land from the Arabs that were living there. Even after the war the
majority of palestinians left on their own.
None of the current Arab countries existed until the British carved up
their conquered territory after WWI. If Israel is not "legitimate" because
of UK/UN involvement does it follow that all of the Arab states that were
formed at this time are also illegitimate? Perhaps we should should
re-unite the Ottoman Empire? How far back in history do you want to go to
find the "legitimate" territorial boundaries? Persian? Roman? Israel?
Egyptian? Sumerian?
I find it quite hypocritical of Americans who see the Israelites as
occupiers and oppressors but would be outraged at calls to give back the
south-west to Mexico. Tim, you want to give your ranch to some Mexican
family since the Americans took that land from them? but then the mexicans
would have to give that land back to some deserving "native" Americans as
they took that land from them. But then again we would have to sift
through the thousands of years of tribal warfare and migration to find the
one true owners of the land.

Sorry Tim, you need to re-check your history.
No one was kicked off their land until *after* war broke out in '45. All
land occupied by the Jews before that was *purchased* from the Arabs
living there. There was also a large percentage of land that was either
desert or swaps that was reclaimed by the Jews and turned into productive
farm land. Tel Aviv was nothing but sand and scrub brush before the Jews
started building there (there was the Ancient city of Jaffo which Tel Aviv
has now encompassed but it took decades of expansion before Tel Aviv
reached that far south).
After the various battles of this 50 year war large percentages of the
Palestinian population left Israelie held territory, but this had more to
do with the Arab leaders calling for them to do so (and their not wanting
to live under Israelie rule) than it did with the Jews pushing them out.
Similar migrations were seen when India and Pakistan were created. Large
portions of Moslem population that were living in India moved to Pakistan
despite Ghandi's calls for them to stay.

market thus driving down the cost (supply and demand).
There are also large reserves of oil in Alaska, Siberia and elsewhere that
are going unused along with other reserves that are too expensive to
extract the oil at current market prices. The so called "oil shortage" of
the 70's had more to do with Oil Companies profiteering than it did with
any actual shortage. I have seen estimates in the past of our domestic oil
reserves showing that we have enough oil to last another 100 years at out
current rate of increased consumption if we stopped all imports today.
Simple economics is that it is cheaper for us to import it than it is to
produce it domestically.
As much as the Greens whine and cry about alternative fuels, the simple
fact is that as long as oil is cheap no one is going to switch.

We used to have a store here called AtoZ Software that opened up a couple
of years back. They were srtictly a software rental store and were doing
*very* good business from it. They ran into quite a bit of trouble (SPA et
al) over it. I didn't follow it too close but I don't think that they rent
software any more. :(

It was US West's computers:
DENVER (AP) -- A 28-year-old computer expert is accused of hacking into
the U S West computer system and diverting more than 2,500 machines that
should have been helping answer phones to his effort to solve a
350-year-old math problem, according to documents filed in a federal
Aaron Blosser also allegedly obtained the passwords to 15,000 U S West
workstations and sent much of the coded material he found in them onto the
Internet, according to an FBI search warrant served at his Lakewood,
Colo., home last Wednesday.
The warrant says Blosser, a contract computer consultant who worked for a
vendor that was hired by Denver-based U S West, is under investigation for
computer fraud.
In a telephone interview with The Denver Post, Blosser said he has not
been charged with any crime and said he made no money from his
unauthorized use of U S West computers. He also failed in his mathematical
quest: the search for a new prime number.
``I've worked on this (math) problem for a long time,'' said Blosser.
``When I started working at U S West, all that computational power was
just too tempting for me.''
Blosser enlisted 2,585 computers to work at various times during the day
and night and quickly ran up 10.63 years of computer processing time in
his search for a new prime number.
U S West spokesman David Beigie called the hacking ``unprecedented'' in
company history. ``It would be virtually impossible to do it from the
outside,'' he said.
Blosser's alleged hacking was discovered when computers at U S West's
facility in Phoenix, which normally respond in 3 to 5 seconds, took as
long as five minutes to retrieve telephone numbers.
The computers were so slow in mid-May that customer calls had to be
rerouted to other states, and at one point the delays threatened to close
down the Phoenix Service Delivery Center.
On May 27, U S West's Intrusion Response Team found a software program on
the system that ``captured U S West computers to work on a project
unrelated to U S West Services,'' according to the search warrant.
The anti-hacking team traced the software to a terminal at the company's
Littleton offices, where they found Blosser, a self-described ``math
Blosser allegedly showed agents how he remotely installed software on
computers throughout the U S West system and reprogrammed them to search
for a new prime number.
