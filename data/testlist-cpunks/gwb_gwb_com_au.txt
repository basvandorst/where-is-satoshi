@_subject: Christmas greetings from Pauline Hanson 
Dear Pauline Hanson's One Nation Supporter in NSW,
1997 has been an eventful year in Australian politics.
1997 will be remembered as the year when Australians at last said that they
had had enough.
Enough of the lies and deception churned out by the major political parties.
1997 will be remembered as the year that Pauline Hanson's One Nation grew
from a fledgling party launched in April to a major political force with a
branch network of over 200 branches.
A quite remarkable achievement. An achievement which could not have been
realised without the dedication and commitment of national director David
Ettridge and his Manly office team.
1997 will be remembered as a year of intimidation. Intimidation by
well-organised protesters with strong links to the Australian Labor Party.
The violence of these protesters against the Australian way of life - giving
everyone a 'fair-go' and the media's blatantly biased reporting against One Nation
failed to destroy the will and desire of the people to support me.
1997 will be remembered as the year in which a few tried to cause a split in
the One Nation party. They knew that the media would report anything negative about the party. And
they did. No matter that in all cases it was just a handful of troublemakers
who tried to hijack the party for their own political gain.
They failed. Today One Nation is more than just a phenomenon it is a real living party.
It is made up of people like you and me. It is part of the political fabric
in Australia.
Looking ahead we will face many challenges together. We must continue to
fight for equality for all Australians. We must continue to fight to protect
our country from becoming a slave to the multinationals and international
bodies. During this Christmas break we all have the opportunity to look back and see
what we have achieved and to look forward to see what has still got to be
done in the coming years.
I wish you and your family all the best over Christmas and the New Year. God
bless and may all your dreams come true.
Pauline Hanson

@_subject: How to overcome the apparent media boycott of Pauline Hanson's new biography 
Dear One Nation supporter in NSW,
It has come to our attention that the newly released authorised biography of
"Pauline, the Hanson Phenonenon" is apparently not being stocked by major
book sellers in most Australian states.
The big exception to the rule is Queensland where publicity and coverage was
given to the book launch and resulting sales in this state have been
excellent. This media coverage has simply not occured in the other states.
Media monitor show that only "The West Australian" and "The Canberra Times"
covered the book launch or any subsequent publicity of any note.
Reading between the lines News Limited, who dominate the print press, have
totally ignored the book.
We would ask you to contact your local major book seller to make a copy of
the book available in their store, book details as follows:
"Pauline, The Hanson Phenomenon" by Helen Dodd, publishers Boolarong Press,
Queensland ISBN This action will result in the book being ordered by your local book store
who have the details on how to make orders for the book. If they say they do
not wish to order or stock the book please contact GWB with the details of
the bookstore.
It is important to note that the book store does not pay for the book as it
is on consignment and anything that they do not sell is returned to the
publisher so their is no financial cost to the book store.
We are confident that the book will be sold, based on extraordinary sales in
Queensland, but without the publicity the general public will not be aware
that the book is available. It appears that the mainstream media are
attempting to prevent the book reaching its potential audience Australia wide.
Your assistance in overcoming this apparent act of censorship would be
greatly appreciated.
Scott Balson.

Pauline Hanson's Monthly electronic newsletter:
October 1997
Issue: 1.3
There are several issues that we would like to cover this month. They are
all very important and need your support to create the momentum we need to
address the wrongs that are currently taking place in Australia.
1) Petition to the Prime Minister:
Firstly please take a moment to sign the on-line petition to the Prime
Minister's office demanding that he not be pressured into putting One Nation
last on the How to Vote cards at the next Federal Election:
The petition is at:
2) The Canadian experience - Canada is now being divvyed up into independent
states. Pauline Hanson's press release at:
looks at the implications to you.
The architect of Canada's break up is now living in Brisbane and advising
the Aboriginal Central Land Council on how to go about divvying Australia up
into a number of Aboriginal States financed by the Australian Federal
D O N A T I O N S   P L E A S E......
3) One Nation is growing (we now have nearly 200 branch offices established)
and we need you to put your hand in your pocket to keep this growth on course.
We have established a web site called 'Take a byte for Australia'. We aim to raise $100,000 through the Internet during this financial year. We
know that this is a big ask but if you believe that the on-line service
provides value and if you would like to help One Nation please 'Take YOUR
byte for Australia now'.
A gauge will display how well we are going towards achieving this target of
on-line donations to One Nation.
You can print out a donation form and send it to Pauline Hanson's One Nation

Please print out and circulate this policy document as far and as wide as
you can so that you can assist us in counter-acting the obvious media
distortions that will follow.
Four Corners report last Monday:
We apologise for the incorrect statement that we gave you in our last post
last week when we said: "On Monday night (10th August) the ABC's Four Corners programme will be
looking at One Nation and the media." It appears that the rules of engagement were changed once again by the media
in a report headed "Inside One Nation". The writer was personally interviewed for 3 hours by reporter Tony Jones at
his office to discuss the (to quote Jones) "The blatant misreporting by the
media on One Nation." The writer was clearly told that the ABC report was to
be along these lines - thus our statement last week. None of the interview
with the writer was used in the report - you can draw your own conclusions.
We can only assume that the ABC's Four Corners program have, in this case,
joined Channel 9's 60 Minutes program in slanted reporting against the party.
You might recall Mr Brendan Bogle the 25 year old ex-President of Petrie
branch was one of many who made negative and incorrect statements about One
Nation on the Four Corners report. Bogle this week told the media that
"there would be a mass desertion of 200 One Nation members from Petrie
branch to the Nationals". Last night 5 One Nation members attended "his" branch meeting. Not all
joined the National Party -  who were represented there by Senator Boswell.
When questioned why the other 200 had not attended Bogle told the media that
they had been "intimidated".
This is blatantly untrue. They did not support him nor his inflammatory
comments made on Four Corners on Monday.
We would ask that you be aware of the bias in some reports and consider what
the real agenda is behind some of the reporting seen on the screen and in
the papers today.

@_subject: The Australia/Israel Review list and Jetset Travel 
Dear One Nation supporter in NSW,
It should be noted by One Nation supporters that the man behind the
Australia/Israel Review, Mr Leibler, is one of the men behind Jetset Travel. When booking your next holiday trip I would ask you to consider what
Leibler's views are on the publication of the list of the names and Suburbs
of 2000 One Nation members and donors in the Australia/Israel Review.
Mr Leibler said the decision to publish the list of members and donors was
in the interests of "political transparency". He said concerns about privacy
had been met by not publishing full addresses and telephone numbers. What Leibler failed to mention is that they published the suburbs that
members live in. Many One Nation members had phone calls from the media -
contacts made directly through the list published by the Australia/Israel
Review. The Australia/Israel Review has since shelved plans to publish the names of
One Nation's remaining 8,000 members. Mr Leibler said: "We feel we have made
our point."
Perhaps it is time for One Nation supporters to make their point?

@_subject: Aboriginal voting and the 1967 Referendum 
Dear One Nation supporter in NSW
I would draw your attention to the following press release by Pauline Hanson
Aboriginal voting and the 1967 Referendum It is clear Pauline Hanson is often misrepresented by the press and the
recent headlines headlines that suggest she questioned Aboriginal
Australian's rights to vote is yet another example of selective reporting.
Is this because of the search for what will be the most inflammatory or is
it just that some members of the press pick out of context what they believe
will do the most damage to Pauline Hanson? "I have not and would not question the right to vote of any Australian
citizen. What I question is whether Australians would have thought twice
about their vote in the 1967 referendum if they had known their attempt to
bring about equality was going to cause the pendulum to go the other way. "The main point of the 1967 referendum was the change of section 51 of the
constitution that allowed the government to make special laws with respect
to Aborigines. It is from this that successive governments have created race
based policies such as Abstudy and 1.5% loans for Aboriginals starting
businesses. "Aboriginal Australians like all Australians should and do have the right to
vote but no one should be treated differently on the basis of race - all
Australians should be treated equally and the same. I am quite certain that
if Australians had understood
where the 1967 referendum would lead, many would have voted differently. "These special laws based on race have led to reverse discrimination and the
rorting of taxpayers money without helping the Aborigines in most need. We
must assist Aborigines, but as Australians in need, not on the basis of
race. We must not make
laws that set Australians apart and are open to abuse by those who pretend
to look after the Aboriginal people. "It is often reported that I want to take benefits from Aboriginal people,
that is not correct and never was correct. It is true many Aboriginal people
are seriously disadvantaged but they do not have a monopoly on being
disadvantaged and should not
be singled out on the basis of race. Everyone should be assisted on the
basis of need." Statement issued by Pauline Hanson MP, member for Oxley Scott Balson

@_subject: HANSON BEING BANNED: PLEASE ACT ON THIS EMAIL 
Dear One Nation supporter in NSW,
Pauline Hanson has been banned from using council facilities in her
electorate of Blair.
The Labor-dominated Ipswich City Council, the heart of Pauline Hanson's seat
of Blair, has returned to their old politically motivated tricks against the
One Nation party.
With the recent Queensland State Election turning the mainstream parties on
their heads the word has gone out - do anything that you can to deny One
Nation their right to a "fair go".
The Council allowed One Nation to use their facilities after a 6 month long
ban following the breaking of a council hall window at the party's launch by
protesters in April 1997. The ban was imposed on the basis of "protecting
council staff from danger".
An example of recent (1998) pre-state election use by Pauline Hanson of the
Ipswich City Council facilities can be seen at:
at the above link Pauline Hanson launched One Nation's state policies
without any security problems or risk to council staff.
One Nation used Ipswich City Council facilities on several occasions this
year without any protesters even making an appearance.
The basis of "fair go" and "freedom of assembly" is equity in decision making. At a recent Labor Party meeting One Nation members demonstrated peacefully
outside the council venue yet no such threat or withholding of council
facilities to Labor has been suggested - nor should it.
Following the State Election the rules have apparently changed.
The Ipswich City Council this week rejected an application by Pauline
Hanson's One Nation to use council facilities on the basis of "concern for
the safety of staff".
The mayor of Ipswich, John Nugent, was one of those voting against One
Nation's use of council facilities.
This is laughable as the last time protesters appeared at a One Nation
meeting was over a year ago in June 1997.
One Nation has (to ensure council staff safety) offered to supply private
security and ensure that sufficient police are on standby - this offer has
been rejected.
The link below will take you to an image of one of the chief protagonists,
Councillor Paul Tully, a Labor supporter who has made it his life ambition
to destroy what Pauline Hanson and you stand for.
Can we let him win?
I don't think so.
I appeal to you to write, in the strongest terms possible, to the local
Ipswich paper, The Queensland Times.
Their email address is:
qt at gil.com.au
Remember to keep your letter to under 200 words to ensure publication.
Issues to look at:
1) The damage to Ipswich's reputation through these undemocratic antics.
2) Freedom of speech.
3) Labor's underlying undemocratic motives.
4) What role the ratepayers who voted Hanson have been allowed in on this
decision by the Labor council?
I encourage you to send the Queensland Times an email letting them know how
YOU FEEL about the Ipswich City Council's decision to prevent Pauline Hanson
from using ratepayer's facilities.

@_subject: Sixty Minutes vs Pauline Hanson 
Dear One Nation Supporter in NSW,
PLEASE READ THIS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT MESSAGE and CIRCULATE WIDELY TO ALL YOU
In the lead up to the Queensland State and Federal Elections there has been
growing hysteria in the media, major political parties and by minority
groups that "support for Pauline Hanson's One Nation is somehow bad for
It should be of no surprise that One Nation has one goal in mind and that is
to bring equity in treatment back to ALL Australians irrespective of colour,
race, or creed. If you read the first sentence again you will see who is
going to 'lose' when divisive policies are removed by One Nation from the
Australian equation.
However, the most divisive force in Australia today is the mainstream media,
carefully controlled by men of enormous wealth who now seek the ultimate
prize, 'power over the politicians who run Australia'.
Many believe that they have already achieved this goal. Many believe that
the support for Pauline Hanson's One Nation  is a direct result of
'populist' Australians (that's you and me) seeing through the deals being
done between the major political parties and the media barons.
Today Australians face a real fight to retain their democratic rights in the
face of the media moguls. This is the 'real' media-hidden war that is being
raged right now with Pauline Hanson being the focus, the enemy. The coming
Queensland state and Federal elections are not over 'race' as the media
would have you believe, they are over our freedom of speech and democracy
which has already being largely destroyed through the concentration of our
Last Tuesday Pauline Hanson raised the issue of 'The Draft Declaration on
the Rights of Indigenous Peoples' in Parliament. What followed was the most disgraceful vilification by Howard, Beazley,
supported by the media, of Pauline Hanson, the messenger, while the message
- the potential impact of this treaty on all Australians - was totally ignored.
This vilification was epitomised by the live interview with Ray Martin on
Channel 9's 'A Current Affair' during which he changed the 'rules of
engagement' previously agreed to. The interview was supposed to be about
Pauline's speech in parliament and the ramifications of the UN draft agreement.
A range of links to documents related to Pauline Hanson's speech can be seen at:
Channel 9 have used these tactics before to secure an interview under
blatantly dishonest terms. Sixty Minutes approached Pauline Hanson to do a
'prime time' broadcast on 'a new political party in the making'... in 1997.
The original letter to David Ettridge confirming the 'rules of engagement'
with Pauline Hanson can be seen at this link:
In both Channel 9 interviews Pauline Hanson has appeared stunned, was
ridiculed by those interviewing her and thereafter denigrated by many of her
opponents. Quite simply she has been ambushed with unrelated questioning by
a less than ethical media doing the bidding of powers higher up.
This Sunday Channel 9's 'Sixty Minutes' has intimated that it will be doing
an 'expose' on Pauline Hanson's One Nation links to 'American influences'.
As of late yesterday they had refused to supply the source of their
information so that One Nation could respond. It will be an interesting time
for 'Sixty Minutes' to carry such a damaging, unsubstantiated programme,
less than a week before the Queensland state election.
The background to the programme to be run tomorrow can be seen at:
Here is a quote from that page:
'But as 60 Minutes has discovered, Pauline Hanson's one nation has little to
do with our nation. Much of her ideology is borrowed from loony extremists
in the United States, right down to her claim this week that the UN was
undermining Australia's sovereignty. Jeff McMullen reports that this fear of
a UN-led global world order is the central theme in the thinking of militia
groups at war with the US Government. And the militia leaders admit they
know and admire Pauline Hanson and have advised her supporters.'
With this in mind I would ask you to take this personal assurance from me. I have been privileged to get to know Pauline and understand the fire that
burns within her for Australia and her children, our future. She is not
influenced by anybody from overseas, her gun laws actually tighten gun
control through
"an instant record check to ensure those persons ineligible to own a firearm
can be quickly identified; we shall establish a register of persons
prohibited from firearm ownership. Prohibited persons: ie those convicted of
a violent offence."
See:   Pauline's aims are to work for the return of Australia to Australians - away
from the negative, direct influence of overseas-based multinationals; to
introduce Citizen Based Referendums; to allow you to have a real say in your
future (One Nation's policies can be seen at:
 and to dismantle the power
blocks controlled by the media barons.
It is this last goal which is behind the vilification of Pauline Hanson by
the media and what she stands for, not the opinions expressed by those who
do their master's bidding.

G'day One Nation supporters in NSW
Channel 9 has embarked on a blatant campaign of misinformation against One
Nation over the last two weeks.
The timing in the lead up to the Queensland State election and the resulting
impact on voters cannot be ignored by ANY Australian who believes in freedom
of speech and the democracy that we hold so dear.
Ray Martin exposed:
60 Minutes discredited:
Below is a copy of an article that appeared in Perth's Sunday times recently.

Judge says no to black state
by Joe Poprzeonzy
A former Chief Justice of the Australian High Court has urged that any
claims by activists for the creation of a separate Aboriginal nation or
independent black states be rejected.
Sir Harry Gibbs said Arnhein Land, parts of central Australia,, north west
WA, islands in the Torres Strait or off northern Australia would be targeted
for Aboriginal independence.
In a keynote address yesterday at a Perth meeting of the influential
conservative group, the Samuel Griffith Society, he said separate laws were
emerging in Australia to cover black and white Australians.
"There is no doubt that any claims by the Aborigional peoples to determine
their own political status, and to assert a right to sovereignty or
independence, must be rejected as contrary to the interests of Australia as
a whole," Sir Harry said.
"Just as any attempt to put the Aboriginal peoples outside the Australian
nation must be firmly opposed, so should any attempt to grant statehood, or
any degree of autonomy to any particular group or Aboriginal people.
"It would obviously be impracticable... to grant sovereign or dominant power
to the Aboriginal people in areas such as country towns in which persons
entirely of European descent were as numerous as the descendants of the
Aboriginal people, many of whom would themselves have had European ancestors.
"Experience elsewhere has shown that associations of States, Federal or
otherwise, do not endure when one state is composed of persons distinctly
different in race, religion or culture from those of another.
"The future existence of Australia would be put at risk if statehood or any
form of autonomy were granted to small communities chosen on the grounds of
race in areas of great strategic importance to this country."
Sir Harry who was Chief Justice of Australia between 1981 and 1987 said some
people were arguing that there was a right of self-determination within
countries. He said groups were working within the UN for the development of
such doctrines.

@_subject: Pauline Hanson deceived - Toyota need to know 
Dear One Nation supporter in NSW
It is with great sadness that I have to alert you, yet again, to the
unethical behaviour of Channel 9's 60 MINUTES programme. This follows the
programme "A CALL TO ARMS" on 7th June in which they tried, without
foundation, to link One Nation to "US extremist militia" just days before
the state election.
See: Last night a segment on 60 MINUTES featured One Nation and an extensive
interview between Paul Lyneham and Pauline Hanson. Her appearance made a liar of her as she is on the record as saying that she
would not again be interviewed by 60 MINUTES.
Pauline Hanson told me this morning, "There was no mention about my interview with Paul Lyneham being for 60
Minutes. The programme approached me a couple of weeks ago and I turned them
down. I feel deceived by 60 Minutes."
"I was shocked when I saw my interview with Lyneham appearing on Sixty
Minutes last night. 60 Minutes know that I do not want to appear on their
programme." END QUOTE.
This behaviour cannot be helpful to the excellent reputation of their major
sponsor Toyota.

Please take a moment to tell them how you feel about these issues.

@_subject: QANTAS discriminates against Pauline Hanson's One Nation 
Dear One Nation supporter in NSW,
Qantas has banned coverage of Pauline Hanson and One Nation from inflight news.
Qantas has effectively censored Channel 9's inflight coverage of Australian
news and has, in effect, implied that there is something "distasteful" about
Mrs Hanson and her political party.
The action allegedly follows a complaint by a QANTAS staff member about
coverage of Mrs Hanson being offensive to Indonesian passengers on an
international flight.
Pauline Hanson's political adviser, Mr David Oldfield, said it was
"disgraceful, un-Australian activity asking Channel 9 to be political
censors on behalf of Qantas.
"Everything that is said publicly, people should have the right to judge for
themselves whether something matters or doesn't," he said.
"But it certainly isn't up to any airline or anyone else to decide that
public debate isn't to be viewed."
If you feel rightfully outraged by this act of censorship by Qantas (the
Australian Airline) please contact them by email:
qantasmedia at qantas.com.au I would encourage you to take a moment to express how you feel about this issue.
Finally, please note Ansett have not undertaken censorship of this sort.

PARTIES CONSPIRE TO KEEP IMMIGRATION OUT OF ELECTION, BOOK SHOWSThe author of a new book called "This Tired Brown Land" has accused the majorpolitical parties of conspiring to keep immigration and population off theelection agenda. The book has already attracted good reviews.Author Mark O'Connor today claimed that both the major political partieswere suppressing discussion in order to deny One Nation 'the oxygen ofpublicity'. But it is exactly such bipartisan ignoring of public sentimenton immigration which caused One Nation, and led to the enormous success ofPaul Sheehan's book Among the Barbarianns.Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock recently launched the Coalition'spolicy in Perth-too late in the day for the Eastern media to pick up thestory. Says author Mark O'Connor, 'Clearly the Coalition knows its policyis not what the electorate wants.'Polls show that the electorate has made up its mind. Only 2% or 3% ofvoters want immigration increased; and they are outnumbered, some 30 toone, by the 65% or 70% who want it reduced. Neither ethnic Australians norAborigines support higher immigration. Most Australians supportmulticulturalism, yet want an immediate moratorium on immigration.'My book shows that in 1994-95 (under Labor) our net migration gain (ABSfigures) was 80,100 persons. Last year it was 83,700. Despite this, theCoalition has tried to give the impression of reducing immigration. Somecritics have even accused the government of "racism" for "reducingimmigration". This is false.'The book is available throough bookshops at $16.95, orby cheque or money order from Duffy & Snellgrove for $19.95 (includes p&p) atPO Box 177Potts Point NSW 1335fx 2 9386 1530dands at magna.com.au
