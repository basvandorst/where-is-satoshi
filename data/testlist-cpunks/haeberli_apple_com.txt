@_subject: USPO & Digital Postage/E-Cash Project 
I would appreciate any citations you can offer which:
-Describe the proposed system in some detail
-Describe the weaknesses identified by the CMU team.
Also, this group might want to know that CMU has (perhaps independently)
done work in this area over two years ago.  It may well be that the team at
CMU which did the USPO contract research is the same team that proposed
digital postage in a research paper in that time frame, and it may well be
that their system would withstand a much more rigorous attack.  I'm afraid
I've lost the precise citation, but I found the report browsing the CMU
tech reports server about 18 months ago.
