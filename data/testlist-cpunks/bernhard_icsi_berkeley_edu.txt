@_subject: [cryptography] Q: CBC in SSH 
We see quite a bit of ECDHE traffic at the sites that feed our notary. At the moment,
the top-3 cipher suites we see (by connection count) are TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA, TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA and TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA.
We also see TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA (7th most popular).
If  is still correct, RC4+ECDHE
is chosen by Chrome and Firefox. AES+ECDHE is Safari and Internet Explorer. The first non-AES/RC4 cipher suite is TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA (9th most popular) followed by TLS_RSA_WITH_CAMELLIA_256_CBC_SHA.
