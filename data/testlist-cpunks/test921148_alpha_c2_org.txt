@_subject: premail manual info 
Whopee! Just installed premail. But I have a Question on how to
use it. I need some Manual explaining how to use Premail
and what can I put into its Configuration-file. I use Version
0.43 of Premail. The perl Script is somewhat readable but it is
better if some User-manual was available.
