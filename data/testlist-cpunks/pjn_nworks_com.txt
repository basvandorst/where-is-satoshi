 It is interesting to note that while both groups have opposite

 are both right.
 I think what we need to define is the diffrence between hackers and
 crackers. A hacker breaks into a computer like a cracker (but the  similarities end there).  The hacker just want to look and learn,  possably "map out" the system just to see how everything works with
 everything else.  Crackers break into computers for the sake of  destroying or stealing information or the system itself.
