@_subject: Photocopying money 
It's true.  Canon did indeed create such a chip.  It's the same chip
that's used in vending machines to scan dollar bills.  They built a
prototype copier which prevented copying money, but I don't know if they
actually decided to install the chip in all their assembly-line
production copiers or not tho.
