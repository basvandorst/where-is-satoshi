That's rather complicated and unlikely to succeed.  A more practical
solution would be a pod that can be jettisoned.  Dark-colored or camo,
rock-like, and indestructable for later retrieval.  No cop would notice
such a thing fired directly forward after he's pulled in behind you and
lighted you up.
Add a radio beacon for easy location after the cop has departed.
