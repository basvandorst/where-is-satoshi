my homekeeping secrets
cate was so happy she began yelling "let's give a hand to springtime! ok, i'm off to knit...
it's definately worth the long drive,
she's amazing. she wears birkenstocks to fashion shows. i LOVE this picture and am so inspired to keep the needles moving. really, cate is also mexican, japanese, native american, swiss, and a lot more- a true american- so we actually have a lot of family history travelling to do, but i really love the romantic beauty of ireland, and have always been drawn to that part of the world. plus i really love corned beef.
i have always dreamed of going to ireland, (and scotland too- mccaleb), to research our family history, and to see the green grass in real life.
pps- our topic of convo for the night was this article from the wall street journal.
when you need to be home, may you find your way.
i love her style. 4. i don't worry about a little "creative clutter" in cate's room. i say, a good dress up/ barbie mess day better than watching tv all afternoon, right? pretty soon i will just put my 'kerchief on again and go to town. (yes, that is what cate's room looks like again, just over a month after the big clean. i tell you, i'm fighting a losing battle with that girl). does that answer your question, mary? i hope it helps! wink.
