You can already do the latter with SwitchProxy
( Basically, it's a
Firefox extension that saves you the trouble of going into the
'preferences' dialogue everytime you want to switch from one proxy to
another (or go from using a proxy to not using one, that is).
It works like a charm with tor and a local proxy. It also has a "Anonymizer mode", which cycles through a list of proxies
in an attempt to give you some kind of pseudo-anonymity (which I guess
is good enough for many people).
