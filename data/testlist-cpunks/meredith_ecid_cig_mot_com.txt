@_subject: Hooks to Crypto (was Re: NSA and the NCSA/Apache web servers) 
I hope I'm not alone in wondering why on earth this is the case.
Ok, exporting cryptography from the USA is restricted, and highly
controversial. I think there has been something on this one already.
But what is it, in the legal wibble, that make _hooks_ to
cryptography restricted. How have they worded things to make this the
The hooks are of course completely useless in and of themselves. You
can only do anything useful with them if you have the matching crypto
Yours a confused Brit ... who doesn't have this problem ... yet!!

I kind of meant "why they think they can" rather than "why they want
to". One can't really help being aware these days what the US
government (and indeed many others) are trying to do.
Oh ... I see ... just like the rest of this stuff, only more so.
Judging by the PZ case, I can't say as I can really blame them. it
would be better of course if they would go for it, but ...
I probably should have written "a crypto package" instead of "the
matching crypto package".
This would infer that anything that can cause information to be piped
out to a package and then the result sucked back in would fall into
this category.

Our lot tend to work in a different way to yours. Similar end result
of course, but different approach.
So when I said "yet". I was meaning that, at the moment, we have no
laws specifically refering to Cryptography and it's export, but the
approach I can see being taken would be:
1 - Find yourself a tenuous link with some Psycho-Baby-Killer group.
2 - Start a "This must be stopped" campain.
3 - Propose the "Internet Pornography Act"
4 - Shove it through before anyone can get together enough
    opposition to get it squashed. (and that would have to be a
    GREAT DEAL of opposition).
That's how they did the "Criminal Justice Act" which breaks both
European and International law in a great many places. That's how
they'll do the "Internet Pornography Act". It'll be just loose enough
to include just about anything they want it to.

@_subject: Security of Web registration of Lview Pro 
Dear Sirs,
I was happy to find that you have put up an SSL form through which one
can register Lview Pro. I filled it in and pressed the button. My
browser then warned me that although the form was sent to me securely,
the data I was sending back was in the clear!
I had a look at the page source for:
  and there is was:
        ^^^^
Therefore the only thing protected by this "Secure Form" is the original
text of the form, rather than the credit card details. I know that:
    "If using an SSL Web browser such as Netscape or Microsoft
     Explorer, please click here to access a secure document."
doesn't actually *say* that your customers card details are secure, but
at first glance it sounded like it to me.
Whatever others may think about the rights and wrongs of it, my personal
policy is not to commit credit card details to open networks, unless
under strong encryption.
I look forward to your comments.

If by PCS you mean the GSM derived 2GHz system, then I believe that they
use the A5 algorithm, the same as GSM. Unless they are using one of
deliberately crippled versions, then I think you'll find that this is
quite tough stuff.
Seeing as the rest of the planet seems to have gone with GSM 900, it's a
shame you guys didn't do likewise, you'd have had proper international
roaming and decent airlink encryption for years by now ;)
As a semi-aside, I'm not sure if anyone here has mentioned it yet, but
the DCS 1800 (another GSM variant) based "Orange" UK cellphone operator,
recently announced that they have linked their MSC direct with the Demon
ISP (biggest UK ISP), so that you can now get a 9600 baud encrypted pure
digital Internet link. It's not exactly as cheap as a local call, and
9600 baud isn't exactly flying, but ...

PS Ok then, maybe I _am_ biased towards GSM, see .sig ;)

Hi Folks,
We've just done a quick test on 2.01 and it would seem that the
"Netscape Registration Wizard" is no more.

@_subject: PCS Encryption? 
GSM is also a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) system. In it's original form it uses specrum around 900 MHz, which I believe not to be available in the US. Shame really, I can roam with my GSM phone over pretty much the rest of the planet ... except the US.
Anyway, there are two higher frequency derivatives, PCS1800 & PCS1900, which have been deployed in the US. I'm not involved directly in the US market so I'm not sure where. I assume however that these are the systems to which Greg refers.
              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Aww shame ;)
GSM uses the A5 algorithm which *is* cryptographically strong, but is unfortunately considered to be top secret stuff. If, however, you were to pick up a copy of "Applied Cryptography, 2nd Edition" by Bruce Schneier you may find something of interest.
I hope that you'll work out from my .sig why I can't say much more.
Hope this helps
