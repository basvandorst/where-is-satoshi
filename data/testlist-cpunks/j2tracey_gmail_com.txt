Convergence is an interesting idea, but I'm not sure how it addresses
the issue in the article. Convergence is designed to deal with
shortcomings of certificate authorities (by providing what Moxie calls
"trust agility," the ability to change who you trust to confirm public
keys). The problem is companies are sharing their private keys. If they
do this, how you get their public key is irrelevant - the content you
send them is accessible by a third party and the content you receive
from them can be tampered with.
Also, Convergence hasn't been updated in over a year and is full of
bugs. I don't think it even works on recent Firefox versions at all (at
least, the official git repo doesn't).

Trust On First Use. It's a key-exchange method where you trust the first
time you grab a key, and use that, instead of a cert-authority or
anything like that. It's used for SSH iirc, though I could be wrong. The
idea behind it is that unless the MITM performs a MITM the first time
and every time thereafter, you'll at least notice the attack, and likely
prevent it.
I was going to provide a Wikipedia link, but I couldn't seem to find
one, other than this one hidden in a user page.
