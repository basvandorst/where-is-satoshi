Do you have plans to try and hang the Supreme Court Justices who upheld
Sodomy laws in Bowers v Hardwick?  What about the significant minority
of Americans who'd completely agree with Santorum's remarks?  The
Justices involved with the majority opinion in Bowers, most notably
ex-Justice Lewis Powell, need some S&M experience with Satan far more
desperately than does Santorum.  Santorum's just a patsy.

Don't forget zero tolerance.  If caught, they'll be suspended or
expelled or transferred.  I've never understood the concept of expulsion
from public school before age 16.  "You must go to school" then "you
must not go to school" seems rather silly to me.  I guess it's better to
have them running around neighborhoods in gangs with real guns than
going to school and using chicken strips to shoot at teachers.  About
the cd swapping, maybe their parents will go to jail, too.  That's going
to be really productive for shaping the child's or young teen's
perception of society.

Where'd you get that idea that private citizens can't violate the
Constitution?  Take a look at 18USC241, 242.  Regardless, federal judges
are certainly state actors, or at least they were when they committed
treason and a change of status shouldn't make them immune to
I'm well aware.  I was only suggesting that there are many other people
beside the not-so-distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania who are in
desperate need of trial, rope, and tree.  I'm confident that in a wide
sampling of religiously-motivated fanatics in the U.S., Sen. Santorum
would not rank even in the top thousand worst offenders.  His comments,
if anything, helped his opposition.  I could hardly imagine the Supreme
Court upholding the premise of Bowers v Hardwick this summer when they
rule on the current case.  Santorum's a harmless dinosaur.

Tar is good for your lungs.  In support of this, the FDA will release a
Minimum Daily Requirements update listing tar as an essential nutrient -
with the caveat that it must be breathed in rather than swallowed - any
day now.  Those pictures of black lungs are nothing to be worried about
- black lungs are more efficient, and the tar coating helps shield lungs
from harmful substances like oxygen.
Nicotine is good for you.  All the proof needed is that it calms down

That may be so, but stories abound of drunk state legislators,
corruption, bribery, and other shenanigans involved in the ratification
of every Amendment from the Reconstruction up to the point people became
serious about doing the Right Thing (tm) with stuff like female suffrage
and the repeal of the prohibition amendment.  There are serious
questions about the validity, specifically, of the 16th, 17th, and 18th
amendments, and it is quite clear that even were there no trickery
involved in the passage of the civil rights amendments, Confederate
States were required to ratify them as a condition for re-joining (read
cessation of occupation) the Union.
Just like the 16th, if someone got a serious opposition movement going
against the 14th, Congress and the States would quickly ratify an
amendment authorizing ex-post-facto law in the specific instance in
question (and probably for all the Amendments that were questionably
ratified so they'd only have to deal with it once), and a follow-on
amendment similar to the 14th which would have effects retroactive to
the "ratification" of the 14th.

exactly devoid of a variety of common disease vectors.  What's selecting

vectors, and China's probably even worse since they've largely screwed
up their ecosystem through overpopulation.
It's had thousands, probably tens of thousands of years.  What are the
chances it'll adapt to use a better vector before genetics advances past
the point where nature can compete with technology?  After that, the
only threats will be from biowarfare programs or from greens who think

The message-id would need to be included.  Lots of people filter
duplicate messages, and those who don't probably should.  If spammers
try to replay, their duplicates get dropped.  If they don't reply using
the same message id, they're forced to regenerate hashcash tokens.
Using duplicate message ids is an RFC violation, and just using those in
the hash avoids the complication of mangled message bodies.  It also
gets rid of idiot MUAs which don't include message ids.

token that may have been generated based on a particular envelop to:
address is valid or corresponds to a delivery list with so many people
that the hashcash should be invalidated and whitelisting required?  If
envelope to: addresses are not each required to have separate hashcash
tokens, doesn't the whole scheme fall apart?

This is just broken.
How do you know what address the sender was sending to?  You have no
reliable access to envelope to: addresses.
Joe bcc's james at nowhere.net, politely generating a hashcash token over
james at nowhere.net and the mesID.  Nowhere.net expands that alias to
james.t.doe at treas.gov.  Whoops.  Hashcash is now invalid, as there's no
reliable mechanism MTAs use to note the original address before the
change.  Some might note it with Delivered-To:, others note it in
received headers, others (qmail, ahem) don't note it at all.
Worse, even if there were a reliable mechanism, all it takes is one
loose cannon with an open mass-mail list and as long as it doesn't
delete whatever header (maybe delivered-to:, maybe something else) that
indicates the list was an envelope to: address, one hashcash token works
for one email to the entire list.
Isn't it simpler to use message IDs for replay detection?  No need to
look for replays using another mechanism when there's already one that
works fine, and that many people use for dup detection today.
No argument there.

I suppose neither Mr. Rupp nor the Inquirer could be bothered to read
the bill or the section of Oregon law referenced by it.  Or perhaps
reading a legislative summary was just too complicated or time-intensive
for their busy schedules, and they decided to skip that formality in
their quest to distribute their quota of truth to the public.
The provisions in Section 3 of the bill, currently in Section 19, Ch.
666 of Oregon Laws, are not related to the first part of the bill which
seems to define terrorism.

What suspension of the Constitution are you talking about?
The only terrorism-related provision in the bill criminalizes willful
[planning of] disruption of free assembly, commerce, transportation,
education, and government.  There's the usual requirement of 2 witnesses
or open court confession.
I agree that the expansion of terrorism laws to cover activity not
linked to the federal notion of "terrorism" is dangerous - those acts
are already illegal - but I don't see how the bill ignores the
Constitution.  It simply adds a duplicate law with a harsher punishment.
The list of 131 crimes identifies those crimes to which Oregon
forfeiture laws apply.  Those 131 (now 132) crimes have nothing to do
with terrorism.
