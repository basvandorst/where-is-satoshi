While most ISP's may not want to be responsible for monitoring transmissions, check out a portion of an agreement from mine. (I haven't and won't sign such an agreement, may therefore be terminated at month's end.)
"4.1  PCIX may elect to electronically monitor any and all traffic which passes over our Wide Area Network.  This monitoring may include public as well as private communications and data transfers from our Members and to our Members as well as any and all communications and data transfers to and from any other internet sites. ....  The monitoring and disclosure activities of PCIX may negate the privacy protections which the Member would otherwise enjoy under federal and state law, including the Electronic Privacy Communications Act.  Member specifically agrees that PCIX may do so and Member understands that he or she is giving up privacy rights which he or she would otherwise be entitled to under the law."
Hope this isn't the start of a trend!
