Your proposal would cause 99% of software currently in use to be rejected and make the development costs increase as astronomically as to be compared to medical research.
That would also smother the hopes of all people that see coding and computers as a way out of poverty.
Like, outsourcing stuff to Asia would grind to a halt.
I agree your proposal is good and doable, yet at a cost the world doesn't wish to pay.
It wouldn't reduce innovation, probably would increase it, though. Also it would filter out all incompetents and posers, forcing them to adapt or look at burger flipping in McDonald's with other eyes ...
