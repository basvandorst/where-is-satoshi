Preview Magnifier in Windows 7
Magnifier enlarges part of the screen making it easier to see small objects such as program and document icons. In Windows 7, Magnifier features new full screen and lens mode options. In full screen mode, most of the screen is magnified within a picture frame-like viewing area. In lens mode, the area around the mouse pointer is magnified. When you move the mouse pointer, the area of the screen that is magnified moves along with it.
