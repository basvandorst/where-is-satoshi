@_subject: Are forms possible in a cookie cutter website? 
I have a website made with cookie cutters. I would like to add a place where people see little windows where they have to fill in their name, email address and possibly phone and a comment box. How does one create that or is it not possible on a cookie cutter website?  Is there a programming text (gif?) I can put in as is done with banners?
I am really a rank amateur and know very little so unless it is very very simple to do, I probably can't do it, mind you.
Appreciate your help.
