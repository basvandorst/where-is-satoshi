xxxx is exactly right on this. Several years ago I posted to sci.crypt
my "novel" idea for packing bits into the essentially inaudible "least
significant bits" (LSBs) of digital recordings, such as DATs and CDs.
Ditto for the LSBs in an 8-bit image or 24-bit color image. I've since
seen this idea reinvented _several_ times on sci.crypt and
elsewhere...and I'm willing to bet I wasn't the first, either (so I
don't claim any credit).
A 2-hour DAT contains about 10 Gbits (2 hours x 3600 sec/hr x 2
channels x 16 bits/sample x 44K samples/sec), or about 1.2 Gbytes. A CD
contains about half this, i.e., about 700 Mbytes. The LSB of a DAT is
1/16th of the 1.2 Gbytes, or 80 Mbytes. This is a _lot_ of storage!
A home-recorded DAT--and I use a Sony D-3 DAT Walkman to make
tapes--has so much noise down at the LSB level--noise from the A/D and
D/A converters, noise from the microphones (if any), etc.--that the
bits are essentially random at this level. (This is a subtle, but
important, point: a factory recorded DAT or CD will have predetermined
bits at all levels, i.e., the authorities could in principle spot any
modifications. But home-recorded, or dubbed, DATs will of course not
be subject to this kind of analysis.) Some care might be taken to
ensure that the statistical properties of the signal bits resemble
what would be expected with "noise" bits, but this will be a minor
Adobe Photoshop can be used to easily place message bits in the
"noise" that dominates things down at the LSB level. The resulting GIF
can then be posted to UseNet or e-mailed. Ditto for sound samples,
using the ideas I just described (but typically requiring sound
sampling boards, etc.). I've done some experiments along these lines.
This doesn't mean our problems are solved, of course. Exchanging tapes
is cumbersome and vulnerable to stings. But it does help to point out
the utter futility of trying to stop the flow of bits.

Good reminder that the opponents may try to foil (or detect) such schemes.
Fortunately, signing such messages will presumably not be illegal (we
hope!) and so alterations will show up immediately and cause howls of

Sandy -
The system I saw on CNN actually tracked the bullets' paths through the air,
creating a trail back to the firing point.  The system wasn't described because, as the announcer claimed, the process hadn't been patented yet.

Speculation on sci.crypt some time ago was that, for at least some
relatively recent model nukes, the code supplied to the PAL contained
encrypted timing information needed for the bomb to ignite.  If you
bypass the PAL, you don't provide the timing info, and the bomb
fizzles because of an asymmetric implosion..
But then, "those who know aren't telling, and those who are telling
don't know.."

A friend has been communicating with an expert involved in the
court case against the government in the Waco massacre.  There
are some technical issues that some Cypherpunks may be able to
shed some light on.
Before and while the compound burned, FBI helicopters continually
overflew the area.  They preportedly recorded events using FLIR (Forward Looking Infrared Radar) and thermal imaging technology.
Given the compound's frame structure, the effects of the fire on
these techniques, etc., why would FLIR and thermal imaging be used and what information would be gathered?  If someone on the list knows anything about these technologies,
please let me know by private e-mail.

But mail and messages from "foreigners" is also "immune from state
restraint," and yet we haven't seen either a ban on mail from outside
the U.S. or a requirement that such mail be inspected, identified,
(I'm not sure if your line "our entire legal system centers around
state restraint" refers to state constraint of citizens, as you seem
to imply in your conclusion, or constraint _of_ the state, as the
Constitution seems to imply.)
Likewise, if I receive a letter, open it, and find a request to remail
it to another address, isn't this equivalent to our remailers? Does
this imply a compelling State need to open all mail?
Does the plotting of various crimes in private homes imply a
compelling State need to place microphones and video cameras in such
Clearly not, so I don't think the privacy of e-mail will soon be
breached just because there are some abuses in some people's minds.
But anonymous handbills are quite common, posted all over the place
here in my home town, and the Supreme Court ruled quite properly that
identities are not required for speech. Likewise, radio call it shows
are dominated by anonymous call-ins.
Ditto for "Name Witheld by Request" letters to the editor, etc.
Lots of speech is not anonymous, because Congresscritters are
identified, because Rush Limbaugh obviously _wants_ his name
publicized, because I want my name attached to my views, etc. But not
because there's any law saying political speech cannot be anonymous.
Quite the contrary.

Actually we are getting strong interest from almost everybody but RSA.
I imagine that RSA may have some plans in this area, but what they are
is unknown to me.
Har! Besides the certificate problems, are there other problems with
PEM that have prevented its adoption?
Our implementation supports this X.509 stuff as well. We don't have a
DUA yet though...

It has been stated publicly several times that we do plan to allow
user configurable certificate authority and server trust.  A user
will be able to configure their browser to talk to servers that have
certificates signed by any CA they choose to trust.

Perhaps.  Some authors might be offended by the idea that
using a different form of a sentence doesn't affect the work.
  Sounds like a disaster to me, unless it can be done
automatically, by a proven-correct program.  I used to use
commercial compilers that (at least claimed to) put their
"stamp" on the assembly code they generated, so they could sue
if you released a product without having a license for the
compiler.  Bugs are bad enough as it is; we don't need extra
ones that only show up in some copies!

That's rediculous. The mother did not flip because Zona led the child away.
The mother flipped when asked about the photos. This caused Zona to not
want the child to see argument. The mother just has serious problems in
general. She feels justified in trashing the place and throwing the lamp,
which is why she refused the punishment and took 30 days in jail. She,
in the presence of her child, was wrong to get violent. She has a lack of
