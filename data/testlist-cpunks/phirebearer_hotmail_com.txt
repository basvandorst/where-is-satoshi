Would you really call the EU protocols a democracy? rule by the unelected technocrats?  And Europes history of not making decisions in secret closed meetings is hardly commendable.  Excepting perhaps the folk who engage in particular behaviour.
Now my understanding of european law is, of course, limited.  But in France wasn't there that case of some rapper been arrested for insulting the police?  And in Germany you can strip the constitutional rights of citizens who engage in treasonous behaviour ( could this include cryptography? if connected with neo-nazis almost certainly right? )
not have a national police force precisely to stop Hooverism.
What about those airline accords where the EU took its member states to court over cabotage agreements.  I'm sure there are ways to sneak these things through.
I'm afraid that that may not be the point.  The primary objective of the arms control laws ( which are the ones being used as references in this case ) is to prevent advanced weapons technology from spreading to the third world.  Now Europe, America, Japan, and other first world countries are all capable of developing high level crypto indiginously.  The less advanced countries on the earth are forced to import it from these countries.  What the passage of this law will do is prevent this export ( example:  the Netherlands, as you pointed out has not cracked down on its internal narcotics trade.  However it doesn't permit exporting narcotics.  Similarly this agreement will probably freeze exports of high level crypto by all the signatory countries, in the same way that america no longer permits high level crypto exports. )
The end result being the NSA should able to read India and Chinas communications without irritations.  Vivek Vaidya

to be
Ever heard of seperation of church and state? Democracy? the rights of the individual?  While you certainly have the right to practice your religion in what ever manner you so choose demanding that everyone else does, or that the president of the us of ais subject to you PERSONAL faith decisions is outragous

your I agree with you completely when you state that religion, ethics, and law are distinct and different things.  Unfortunately in the United States they have a strong tendency to become intertwined.  The law as it stands is that impeachment is only to be used in cases of high crimes and misdemeanors.  Now I have not read the entire Starr report nor do I have a sophisticated background in law nevertheless nothing Bill has done seems to qualify as worthy of impeachment under the law.  However, the sexual acts and behaviour exhibited by him is deeply repugnant to many on ethical grounds and particularly repugnant to Christians specifically.  I do not have any problem at all with those who are disgusted by the presidents behaviour on ethical or religious grounds, I personally find it repulsive.  I do however feel, as I believe you are saying also,  that the law is law.  It should be executed in a fair and just manner and according to the letter ( which may or may not lead to impeachment ).  The previous poster to which I replied seemed to be very clearly stating that his personal religious code of ethics took precedence over american legal codes,  a viewpoint which I cannot agree with.  All debate on the precice origin and validity of 'seperation of church and state' aside I cannot recall any part of the constitution which invokes divine justice.  The impeachment issue is not one of ethics or religion, simply law and law alone.
