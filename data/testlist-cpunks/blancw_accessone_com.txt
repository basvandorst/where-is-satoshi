@_subject: Info on Netscape's key escrow position 
[in regard to Jim Clark "preaching acquiescence"]: Where is the recognition that the right to tap communications is not granted by God but an accident of technology, one which can be taken away by technological progress as easily as it was granted?
I agree with Hal's comments.  If Netscape acquiesced to the use of GAK, it would be very easy for cypherpunks and others to switch browsers; they could re-direct interest to Mosaic or even create their own.
Netscape is in a prominent position, however, in the net community, which is looking to prevent government control of their electronic communication.  The NSA and other government agencies are looking for excuses to give their decisions the appearance of legitimacy.  Any perceived weakness on the part of the commercial key players in cyberspace can be perceived as conducive towards the implementation of mandatory security plans, in disregard of the actual desires of internet users.
It appears that Netscape is stuck between a rock and a hard place:  .  if they adamantly resist GAK, they're in trouble with "the Law"
.  if they appear agreeable to complying with future legal mandates, they're in trouble in with their customers in cyberspace.
Losing the fight intellectually precedes losing it in fact.  This is more likely to result when the distinction between government "authority" vs citizen "rights" is obscured from the general consciousness (as in: whose business is it, anyway?).
Anyone who provides a communication service which can be made accessible to "the Law" becomes by default a representative of the issue, which to me amounts to what someone want to promote in the U.S. (or the world) in terms of ideals; in terms of a way of life.
It would promote an atmosphere of intellectual integrity to have explicitly definite statements about the objections to GAK, but barring that it is useful to know that these representatives appreciate why the difference is important.
.  is it because money is being lost?
.  because privacy is at stake?
.  because the ideal of self-determination is being muddled, along with
.  an understanding of where the concept of "individual unit citizens" stands in relation to concepts of "government authority"?
.  because of the consequences of that obfuscation?
The caution with which this GAK business is being dealt with I think is symptomatic of an underlying problem, which is of not having a sense of freedom to stand up to the Dark Side.

@_subject: Info on Netscape's key escrow position 
Blanc, On 12 02 95 you pointed to:    ...an underlying problem, which is of not having a sense    of freedom to stand up to the Dark Side.  You have put your finger on perhaps THE problem: Why did we cast aside our sense of freedom?  How may we re-ignite the spirit of freedom? Yes, I think it's a pretty important element to ponder, this lack of the sense of freedom.  I don't think that "we" all (especially on this list!) have cast it aside.  I do notice that it seems to dissipitate the closer that one gets to govmt agencies (or vice versa).  I have often heard people say "well, if it becomes a law, we'll have to uphold it".  That seems to be the end of all effort towards reality, as though no further advancements toward truth were possible.  It's a continual problem, fostered from being in the lower rungs of the pecking order of "authority" and then beginning to think that one rightly belongs there.
Yet how often, especially lately, does technological progress make obsolete what yesterday was an "important" social/political issue requiring "offical intervention" from higher authorities to impose the lowest standards of functioning so that everyone could "get along".
Sometimes the issue just goes away from atrophy or obsolescence, once certain talented individuals discover new, improved ways of getting things done.  Of course, there's still always another social fear to overcome, and the more that inventors & scientists & techonologists push back the envelope of what is possible (especially in the field of electronics & communication), the closer they get to the gist of the problem with people's attitudes & behavior toward each other, and the closer also to the governing agencies which were created to deal with these concerns.
Some things I know which inspire the sense of freedom to stand up to the Dark Side is to have definite knowledge, integrity, a personal vision of the future (an ideal), and some really useful tools (be they hardware or software).  This list is intended to focus on the tools of cryptography in relation to privacy, James, and far-off digressions are discouraged because of the volume of mail which this would result in.  So do try to focus on that, won't you, or you'll continue to hear from Perry, who works tirelessly to keep everyone in line.  :>)

2)  And no government on earth will find easy to decipher is an
understatement.  As I'm sure you know, properly deployed modern cryptography
(or even the 100-year-old technology of one-time-pads) is mathematically
infeasible to break.  Though of course attacks other decryption remain I see what you mean.  When I read his statement, I focused on the "will be able to transmit coded messages".
I was thinking about the efforts of the govmt to prevent it, and about how nevertheless even a 10-year old will be able to accomplish it in spite of the efforts against it (GAK).

I'm surprised at you. I thought you were anarcho-capitalist. Oh, well; I have a few pithy comments in reply to your post (but anything beyond this will be in private email).
I'm tempted to say back to you, as you just recently stated: "if you have not walked in the other's shoes, keep silent."  Have you read any of the books on Microsoft or Bill Gates?  I think this would provide you with additional perspective on your conclusions about him and the company.
But think about this:
.  no company which MS has done business with has been coerced into dealing with the company and its products.  Those who felt compelled to do business on Billg's terms were influenced by their desire to reap the lucrative benefits of it. .  no customer has been coerced into purchasing the products offered;  they were not prevented from shopping for computers from companies which do not pre-install the OS; if it was already installed on the machines they purchased, they were free to delete it, they were not coerced into using it or into upgrading to the next release.
.  not only have many software companies not take advantage of the opportunities created for cashing in on the unexpected popularity of MS software, .  there have been occasions where competitors failed to see opportunities in the market which Microsoft did and took aim for, or
.  attempted business deals/associations among competitor software companies did not come about, thus failing to create a concerted competitive threat to Microsoft, or .  a dominant software product from a competitor suffered in the market place, (sometimes from the fault of "bad management"), thus again giving the advantage to Microsoft.
Often it has been what the competition *didn't do*, which gave Microsoft the advantage in the "market place", rather than any amazing magical business savvy or "unethical business practices".  Nevertheless, as someone at MS said, "it isn't the customers who are complaining". There have been many willing participants, apparently, who have cooperated (or "conspired", if you will) in making the company the success which it has become.  And continue to do so.

@_subject: last straw (or Possible Developments re Censorship) 
And now comes the *point*:
There's much information on CompuServe that cannot be accessed from the outside.
One example is the very informative National Computer Security Association's
forum. ...[etc.]
Aside from the obvious implications to liberty,  of the backing down from standing up (!) to the demand for self-censorship, I was thinking about other possible developments:
Since, as 'Dr. Dimitri' mentions, CompuServe offers some info which is not available from other sources - and this info is often quite useful/valuable to business enterprises, such that they and other individuals would not be too keen on abandoning these immediately just for the principle of the thing - it could develop that those who are willing and can afford it, will end up "supporting", or getting services from, different providers based on the particular services which they offer.
This could represent a partial solution (in my mind, at least, not being inclined toward blanket censorship of all things discomfitting to my sensibilities) to the matter of there being free-radical electrons "out there" existing in the form & shape of various degrees of sexual permutations:  .  Those concerned that their children may innocently surf over to alt.binaries.naughty.nude.x-rated.pictures and see alarming truths about adult behavior, and don't want to purchase the available filtering software, could subscribe to CompuServe and rest assured that their children would only have access to safe, industrial-strength info on that account.
.  Those wishing want to discuss their sexually-related personal problems, or who are pleased to just look at/talk about sex et al,  could continue do so through their subscription to the adult bbs-es or local ISPs providing uncensored access to all newsgroups.
It could develop that large companies providing internet access will seek to distinguish/identify themselves (as they are tending to do already) between the pablum-feeding family-types like AOL, or corporate/business-types like CompuServe, or free-for alls like local ISPs.   Such developments of course would depend on a tolerance for the existence of those un-specialized carriers which aren't adverse to transmitting controversial, "sensitive" content.   These divisions among services might still not be acceptable to States and Nations & other 'busybodies', but the resistance to such developments would only serve to more explicitly define the problem;  it could make prominent the real issue of people's attitudes, fears, and expectations concerning sex & human nature, and of the obstacles in the way of achieving personal responsibility regarding these (among other things).

People as marketplace players do not think like that.  This is a very important point to consider:  how a person as a customer will _actually_ think.  It is easy enough to propose schemes based on one's preferences of how one would like a potential customer to make decisions about services, products, and methods of payment for what is offered.  But doing the customer's thinking for them doesn't automatically transform them into that line of reasoning.
To better compute whether they will proceed according to how you have imagined, it is more realistic to consider how the other person reasons on the circumstance they are facing - from their perspective.    Market researchers actually carry out tests for consumer response and acceptance of products or payment schemes in order to gauge their success.  And there are many kinds of potential customers, who will make different decisions in regard of the same thing:  some will find it a good idea to think about software in terms of "contributing to its growth" in the longterm, but some will have immediate needs which they are trying to satisfy and may think "I need a solution to my problem *right now*" and will look for the product/service which will solve their problem as it stands in the present.
This is another attractive feature of "the free market":  in it one can find all sorts of schemes & methods for solving all sorts of problems in different ways.  There is no single type of consumer, no single circumstance, no one service or product or scheme which will satisfy everyone, equally, at all times.

@_subject: Crypto's Role in Evil? 
The cpunks like to avoid bringing up these issues because they become so complex, convoluted, involved, & protracted, but these comments from Timothy C. May are real discussion-bait.
In the past, when I have read the non-libertarians on the list argue against the ideas of those libertarian/anarcho-capitalist cyphertypes on the list, but who nevertheless also involve themselves with the mechanics and successful implementation of unbreakable crypto ("strongly voluntary", of course), I have wondered if they had thought much on what this would be making possible in the real world of future events, since it would involve such activities as Tim outlined - possibilities which their philosophical sympathies would compellingly induce them to call for strong controls against its widespread, easy employment.
TCM:  "In the view of some of us, strong crypto and the swirl of ideas called "crypto anarchy" will mean that the transactions people enter into are the ones they wish to enter into.
      ....
Indeed. And crypto anarchy will make this information liquid and widely
available, perhaps even stimulating the production of even more such data
by various means."
One thing I can think of, since crypto is supposed to level out the playing field, is that those who are aware of how this information is being got (the methods and means by which it is being obtained) will also have the means to communicate this information to those who have an interest (nay, a stake) in knowing about it.
[Conspiracy theories abounding.  This makes me think of a movie I saw once set in the French pre-revolutionary period, where Marquises and other mukkety-muks were at an elaborate evening dance.  Everyone was secretly passing around messages on little pieces of paper, each of which said "kill so& so".  It was an exciting, eventful evening.]
Another thought is that as people become more separated into individual self-reliance, they must develop other ideas, organizations, or means by which they may defend themselves from abuse.  That is, if they cannot rely on governments (as they come to realize that governments don't make much difference in terms of salvation), then individuals must become more imaginative over how they can defend themselves against those who are not so conscientious in upholding a sense of personal honor & moral rectitude.
Perhaps the new cyberage would assist in the spread of such ideas as well (perhaps even using the new mind-wave machines).
As people keep repeating, "May you live in interesting times."

I have been broswing through the MSN (Microsoft Network), and discovered a section in the "SOHO" (Small Home Owner's Guidebook) called "Partners Pages".  In it there is a list of companies with icons which subscribers can click on to view these companies' business/financial-related services.
One of them is the Pinkerton Risk Assessment Service.  I opened & examined their several icons, and it suddenly occurred to me how useful this kind of on-line information could be to individuals in the new anarcho-capitalist, nationally-borderless world. Sort of in keeping with the theme which Sandy Sandfort and Duncan Frissell brought up with their "lectures" on "Risk" last year, as well as what I had said in an earlier post about people in our brave new world needing to become imaginative in providing for their own self-defense (seeing as how trusting the goverment doesn't work so well), it occurred to me that having information on threats to one's physical safety would be fitting for this need - like the RISK mailing list is for computers/software.  This kind of data would be different from what we can get on the regular news, which is combined with many other kinds of news and is very generalized, in that it deals more specifically with the subject.
They advertise their services as:
"... the risk assessment tool for the 21st century. If you or other members of your company travel internationally, the Global Risk Network  on MSN. is an invaluable service, keeping you informed of worldwide events, political turmoil, global sensitive spots, and more! Now you have direct online access to a wealth of exclusive Pinkerton information, all via your computer. You can even order hard copy reports or have customized research performed by Pinkerton Risk Assessment  experts, simply type in your request. Tailored for the individual traveler, as well as the corporate executive, our risk services give you several options to know the security situation anywhere."
Although their services are advertised for the corporate business traveler, it obviously is of use to any traveler, and particularly to the person who is in the location mentioned.  They have icons opening up to BBSes where they report on trouble spots and potential threats in a timely manner:
"The Global Risk Network provides even more detailed country data, including � The Daily Risk Assessment � Weekly Risk Assessment
� Special reports � Statistical analysis of significant incidents
   by country and region � Security tips � Eye on Travel "
You would think that if the NSA & other State Departments used their services, that they wouldn't need to poke around people's computers to better predict where to put added security for high honcho dignitaries or State office buildings.  But isn't that what the intelligence services are for?  Oh, well. Here, I thought, is a great service for the regular person which they can use to be prepared for the exigencies of life's little problems, like terrorists and other restive types with violence on their mind.
For any of you in the Washington, D.C. area, there will be a lecture from Pinkerton next week as detailed below.  If anyone from this list goes, it would be interesting to get a post on what they say - the section on cybersecurity might be of relevance to the list.
(I got this from the same location on their MSN site.):

And you of all the cpunks, Perry, are the most affectionately considered. :>)
Actually, those who want to become official spokewheels should consider that the cypherpunk agenda is to promote anarchic (i.e. individualistic, self-responsible) action.  That is, that the individual who chooses to act in a 'cypherpunkish' mode does so at their own risk by their own motivation by their own decision and their own discretion.  Not everyone on the list subscribes to this ideal of complete independence; furthermore, for anarchist types to identify with a "group" would be inconsistent with the philosophical attitude of the "members", who come-&-go as they please.
However, it would be an amazing event to see VZ Nuri-logical (Cypherpunk Extraordinaire) on TV, saying something like, "Yes, I fully and completely subscribe to the Cypherpunk agenda:  black markets, anarchy, overthrow of governments.

A note on the arguments disintegrating into granular accusations & counter accusations:
Some of you ought to realize that no matter what category of political/philosophical inclinations a person has, or deems themselves to have, or is deemed to have by others, they as individuals are still going to have their own peculiar perspective, their own version, of these views.   Meaning, that it is not 100% predictable that *all* libertarians will think & do the same as all other so-called "libertarians".

does it mean, "majority of the governed?" how exactly is consent expressed?
.  How exactly is consent extractedH^H^H^H^H^H^ requested?
.  When exactly is consent identified? .  How exactly is government applied to the consentees?    (caning, jailing, fines, etc.)
.  How exactly do consentors change methodologies when they suddenly realize that they, too, can be subject to their own device?
.  Why should non-consenting citizens live with governing methods which in fact conflict with the pursuit of those three human virtues:  life, liberty, happiness?
Supposedly, government is devised for ruling the "unruly";  a matter for definition and (dis)agreement which can provide endless hours of amusement for authoritarians, especially in court.

(...)But I don't necessarily look at the
NSA as an enemy.  Right now we're on opposite sides of an important issue,
and I think they're doing a lot of damage.  But I tend to think that they
believe what they're doing is in the national interest.  They're trying to defend democracy -- our democracy, at least.
"The" NSA is not a constant, a body which remains the same regardless of the individuals working within it.  The character of the agency, I expect, would change with the individuals.  The agency is not designed to be dangerous to citizens.  But their mileage could vary depending upon the leadership, upon their grasp of its purpose.
That's what this list is all about:  we're trying to impose certain civil
liberties on the world using a strategy that's based on anarchy theory. That theory tells us that if we can distribute tools and establish
standards we'll secure privacy and free speech rights regardless of what
governments do.  That's a very startling idea, and I believe it's sound. I believe that it's possible to impose the first ammendment on the entire
world by distributing crypto software.
But realize that these software tools and what they make possible (first amendment ideas, anarchy) are not being "imposed" - they're being selected/accepted by the users by a process of conscious individual decision, not by a blanket policy imposition handed down from 'above' (you *will* use crypto, and you *will* like it).
I don't think the NSA is out to suppress our liberties.  They're trying to
protect the nation.  Their problem is that they're operating under an old,
obsolete paradigm. (.......)
But the question is,  why are they operating under obsolete paradigms?  Why aren't they paying attention to what they are doing, to what is intelligently appropriate, to the philosophical ideals of the nation they're representing?  (and therefore who or what are they *really* trying to protect)

the problem that "covert thought control" becomes more possible with
an information age that does not handle identity in any "permanent" or
"enduring" way. agent provocateurs etc. may be more difficult to identify
and easier to create and maintain.   in fact a single "government
thought control agent" might be able to create and maintain dozens of
convincing identities, all of them working to subtly manipulate the
population's thinking without detection. (...)
I read the book, too, Nuri, and I think you overlooked an important point.  It doesn't matter about the identity of the provocateur.  It is the identity of the "target" which is crucial.  It is when the prisoner in a psychologically restricted setting begins to identify with their agent-provocateur cell mates, to sympathize with and accept their ideology, that change in that prisoner's mind becomes possible and the thought control is achieved.
This change in the prisoner's image of themselves is not so easily accomplished in a setting where they are free to leave, free to seek and hear other points of view - more importantly, the actual truth.
A mistake people make even when they are not physically imprisoned, is that they seek to benefit by association:  they will accept an appearance of confidence as equivalent to knowledge, accepting the word of those who "seem to know", instead of searching for definite facts.  They come to depend upon their identification with groups of such like-minded people, and thus get themselves in trouble when the whole herd is suddenly corralled and taken for a ride (by their leaders).
Rather than worry so much about anyone's actual identity as a determining factor in what one will accept from them, I think it is much more critical to consider the content of the information they offer; to develop one's judgement (to "know how to know")so to be able to evaluate that information and make realistic decisions for one'self about what to support or what actions to take.

I don't understand your point. both the agent provocateur and "victim"
are crucial to the process of brainwashing. they are the yin and yang
of it all, of course, and I am certainly not arguing otherwise. what
I was pointing out was that it is increasingly difficult to identify
people's secret agenda in cyberspace. "What distinguishes coercive persuasion from other kinds of influence processes is the degree to which the person who is to be influenced is physically or psychologically confined to a situation in which he must continue to expose himself to unfreezing pressures.   Not only did the prison confine him physically, but the round-the-clock vigilance and pressure from cellmates confined the person psychologically to an environment in which unusually intense unfreezing pressures were present at all times...."  (from the book)
Now, you know that no one either on this list or anywhere in cyberspace is confined, either physically or psychologically, to continuously & unwillingly expose themselves to alt.usenet.kooks or  or cypherpunks, etc..  If they continue to do so it is because they themselves have put themselves there or have not seen fit to leave when it behooved them (sometimes requiring the use of kill files to avoid them).
A person in an unrestricted setting, who is so easily persuaded by others that they cannot resist being influenced, has a lot of work to do in finding out about their own lack of self-confidence & direction.   A "victim of information" must study & discover the difference between valid info & dangerous nonsense.  There are ways to know when someone is trying to supplant one's own initiative with their own preferences.  And here's plenty of debate & unrestricted flaming in cyberspace to challenge anyone's passive acceptance of another's conclusions (or of their own unexamined presumptions).  And there's always new software tools to enable participants to make a quick exit if they feel uncomfortable with a conversation.

Actually, Vlad is has a remote point.  When signs on the road advise everyone to buckle up - because "it's the law", it has the intent of providing the be-all and end-all reason for why we should do the things we do.  When certain activities are described as being "illegal" it lends to the laws surrounding them an air of legitimacy, even though most anyone on this list who refers to them in that way understands that they are phrasing their words in terms of how these actions are perceived/categorized by the lawmakers, not by the cpunks.
Yet you must understand, Vlad:  you aren't going to figure out how to deal with a looming threat like ITAR simply by being nonchalant & devil-may-care.   The fact that some people (lawyers) know what corporations & individuals are facing if they try to import or export "illegal" substances like abstract code, and the fact that some people (programmers) discuss the issues openly, does not mean that they are headed in the direction of submission to the given obstacles.   It just means that they're thinking through the problem, to clarify just what the situation is, to give conscious consideration to what anyone might have to deal with as a consequence of their decisions (to do what they will regardless of the NSA's perceptions).

no, your own fear is harming you. no law requires that you be in fear
of it (some may try, but that is not a law that can be written). that is the point of the law, that is the intent of it. "The Law" is using psychological warfare in its attempts to keep stray cats in line.  This is because they haven't thoroughly considered the nature of the circumstance within which they are attempting to operate  - the condition of respect for the individual and a support for the rights of liberty.
They too are afraid.  They also are moved by the fear of threats like "the four horsemen".  They are so focused on this fear that it overrides their "Prime Directive", which is to uphold the above mentioned principles.   They use the threats of the law to inspire complicity, but they do have the resources to carry out their threats.   While an agency like the NSA is sufficiently well-funded where they can concentrate on pursuing their case against a target, a company or individual is engaged in creating their income at the same time that they must also use a portion of these resources to defend themselves in court (as well as defend their public image).   It would be a noble project to challenge something like the ITAR in a court of law, where the issues and flaws of the government's attitudes & methods could be brought out in detail, dashed to the ground by brilliant reasoning and argument, winning a battle not only for privacy, but for the lofty goal of individual sovereignty.   But it would take a lot of time, some very able talents, and a lot of cash; most lone cryptographers would not be able to do these two things at once (making a living while also fighting the dragon).
It's easy for you, Vlad, to chastise others for being cowardly, when you have nothing to lose (and only incendiarism to offer).  Those who are enjoined to take action must calculate how much they can afford to invest in such an expensive venture.   You asked me in an earlier post how I could distinguish just any poster to the list from someone who might be an "agent provocateur".   By this:  they only provoke action from others - encouraging, cajoling, shaming, pushing them into thoughtless action, without themselves taking on any of the risk involved, without themselves facing any of the dangers but only getting others to do so.
The government does operate on support, and criticism of their policies lets them know where they stand (unsupported).  But it also communicates to those in office ideas which they find it difficult to consider (or outrightly disdain).  It serves to educate them as well, these controversial meetings and discussions:   it reveals to them how just how educated everyone is on the matter of their rights under government, on the matter of how they see themselves in terms of self-determination, and on how they are each prepared to act accordingly.    Public discussions have the value of education for those govmt representatives who do not consider thoroughly the implications of their policies, who are not clear on concepts of privacy.
It would be great to have a show of fireworks in a court of law.   But (and I don't mean to begin a long thread of discussion on this) I myself would wonder why the Supreme Court wouldn't already be defending us from the attacks against basic ideals like personal privacy.   There are already in existence a body of "authorities" assigned to the task of preserving the Constitution, educated in Law and the principles for which this nation stands.   They are the ones whom I would address with inquiries over negligence & lilly-livered, yellow-bellied non-involvement.  I guess someone has to bring the matter to their attention, bringing up charges of injustice for their wisdom to cogitate upon.   Nevertheless, it is to them, who are in charge of maintaining consistency to the ideals within The Constitution, that I would ask, "why have you forsaken us"?

government to do these things is a recipe for failure, at very high costs

This is what I also understood Tim's point to be.
As long as transforming the whole world into a "kinder, gentler", safer, mix of countries, economies, politics, races, religions, recipes for living, etc., is but a remote possibility in a far-off future galaxy, and knowing that governments are typically unprepared to deal with the dangerous states of mind incited by their very own policies,
then (as always) it is wise and adviseable that a person take up some responsibility for preparing themselves, mentally and otherwise, for dealing with  threats of terrorism, the kind of which we are all aware of by now.

I suppose you don't understand what it might be like for someone to be
unable to do their work no matter how heavy the threat against them if
they don't, and no matter how easy it is. There are people out there
who can't get themselves to pay a phone bill or throw out the
newspapers for months on end -- they just can't get themselves to
dance around into the task no matter how hard they try, no matter how
great the threat (job loss, etc) to them is. Drugs create a picture of coercion - where the mind is coerced into a state arrived at not by thoughtful consideration, but by round-about ways of achieving the desired result.  This is what makes some people wary of them, but make them appealing to others who find this very feature attractive - that they can get results without having to think about it.
There are times when people have been totally unmotivated to take care of themselves or the mundane matters in life because they were not involved in the pursuits which were of true value to them, and life "lost its meaning".  Putting one's priorities into perspective can do a lot towards feeling motivated to attend to life's minor contingencies, while elevating the lesser items to the top of the hierarchy can totally dissipitate one's energies and interest.
What if someone was working at a "practical" kind of job, living the kind of life prescribed by someone else, when what they really wanted to do was something related to fine art or other field, living a different kind of "life-style"?   This could be so depressing that subconsciously they would finally rebel from supporting that false existence, and find themselves with no energy to move.
Maybe Ritalin could make them forgot their true interest which was lying dormant, pushed away by who-knows-what kind of arguments against it, and help them to start paying attention again to those mundane, irrelevant aspects of existence.  Maybe it could help them forget the *point* of their existence and they could attend to ordinary things which are easily understood and accomplished without too much creative energy.  Maybe Ritalin could help force them to pay attention, in spite of the protest from their submerged psychology.
In taking 'beneficial' drugs there's always a question of whether someone's mind is being helped into awareness or overpowered into submission, even if the results seem to be acceptable to everyone.
You're right, Perry, that no one should be making that decision for others.  I do think, though, that achieving self-command by a conscious knowledge of what is right for one's nature is actually the most beneficial (and less controversial).
(But I wonder how this would apply to crypto.  Hmmmmmmm - only in reference to those evil old men in the govmt who......might allow it to be prescribed indiscriminately.)

Oh.  I thought it was "we hold these truths to be too uneconomical for us to deal with".
On a side note, I was thinking some time ago about situations in far off places in Europe where some people are mistreating others in the most horrendous ways (like Bosnia where the males are being beaten, the females are being raped).  The news services report to us what is happening and so we know all about it, and we may feel the greatest sympathy for them, but yet be unable to render assistance - sufficient assistance - to be of any real help, from lacking the resources necessary to do what would be required.
So here is an example where one would be moved, not to impose one's view of what is right or wrong, but to provide relief to those suffering, based on one's sense of injustice, yet likewise calculate that it would not be feasible to take action, reasoning that the cost would be excessive; too burdensome.

The citizens who feel themselves unfairly included resort to the use of technology to deal with impositions of the State upon them when their own ideas on morality are not accepted as legitimate.   A lot of people talk about morality and justice, but really who gives a flip.  The place of these ideas in the everyday life of each person reduces to irrelevance in the face of all the ignorance and cynicism, and in consideration of the alternative technologies which can be used in place of reasoning, when reasoning makes no difference (when you can't force people to think, as often happens).

Instead of other people's theories and solutions being imposed upon them, individuals are seen as capable of interacting with each other and making decisions and trades in the market of choices made available through commercial enterprise, thus involving themselves in the discovery, pursuit, and satisfaction of their true interests.

Over the past few years, a new technology has been rapidly taking
shape.  It is the technology of wearable computer systems --
battery-operated computer systems worn on the user's body on a belt,
backpack or vest, designed for mobile and predominantly hands-free
operation, often incorporating head-mounted displays and speech input.
Such systems are now being prototyped and investigated in the context
of a wide variety of military, educational and industrial
applications, including maintenance, training, and manufacturing.
On August 19-21, Boeing will host an informal workshop on wearable
computer technology, at the Boeing Customer Services Training Center
in Renton, WA, a few miles east of Seattle-Tacoma International
Airport.  Our intent is to bring together vendors and potential
vendors of these systems, researchers studying this technolgy, and key
application customers for an open discussion of the future of wearable
computer systems technology.  The workshop's technical focus will be
on the platforms, peripherals, software systems and applications
associated with wearable computers.  The format of the meeting will be
as follows:
o There will be several research presentations.  Leading university,
industrial, and government labs will discuss the research they are
doing concerning the design and use of future wearable systems.
o Booth space will be available for vendors to display and demonstrate
their current products. o Selected government and industrial developers will describe the
wearable computer applications they are planning or implementing,
and the technical requirements implied by these applications.
o Later in the meeting, participants will separate into breakout
discussion groups of their choice to focus on issues of particular
interest to them.  Each breakout group will present a summary of their
discussion and their recommendations to the main body of the
workshop particpants.  Breakout discussion topics may include
A more detailed list of possible breakout discussion topics is
included on the workshop registration form.  Registrants are requested
to select which topics they believe would be most worthwhile to
address at the meeting.
How to Apply to Participate
Because of space limitations and the informal nature of this workshop,
attendance will be limited to 150. Persons or groups wishing to attend
should submit either a booth request or a research or application
position paper, as described below.  Academic, government, industrial
or vendor researchers and government, industrial or vendor application
developers are invited to submit position papers.  As time permits,
attendees will be asked to give brief talks about their research or
development activities, based on their position papers.  There may not
be time for all attendees to speak to the group.  In that case, the
organizing committee will try to select a representative mix of
research and application talks from among the position papers.
Position papers and booth requests may be submitted by mail to
or by fax to 206-865-2965, or by Internet mail to diane.rush at iss-rt.boeing.com
We strongly prefer submission via e-mail (ASCII text). For related questions, Diane can be reached by phone at 206-865-3211.
Due Dates
Booth space requests and workshop position papers are due by June 19.
The committee's selections will be announced by July 12.
Research Papers
People engaged in research projects on wearable computer systems are
invited to submit a two-page position paper, describing Application Papers
People conducting or commencing applications of wearable computers to
military, industrial, medical or other domains are invited to submit
two-page position papers describing their project, including
Vendor/Demo Booths
Booth space in and near the workshop auditorium is limited.  Displays
should be designed to fit within an 8' by 6' area.  Each display will
have access to electrical outlets and will be provided, if they
desire, with a 5' by 2' table.  Booth requests will be filled on
a first-come, first-served basis.
There are several hotels in Renton near the Boeing Customer Services
Training building.  Boeing buses will transport workshop attendees to
and from the meeting at the beginning and end of each workshop day.
The list of recommended hotels will be sent to attendees along with
their selection notification.  These hotels are reserving blocks of
rooms for workshop attendees until July 18.

@_subject: info assembly line, "flits" (long) 
"flits" would have an identity irrespective of companies. one
could track them moving through different companies if necessary.
(the "flits" might therefore also have security aspects associated with
them.)  the point is that the data must not be disconnected, it
must be seen as continuous, and I think a flit-like concept is key
to accomplishing this.
Wouldn't this accounting of "flits" require that each of them be assigned a tag?   Since this would encompass all the "flits" in cyberspace irrespective of who/where used them, whose "flits" would be counted first, beginning where?   And once one "flit" was attached to a document which was maintained as a permanent structure somewhere in someone's database, that means it could not be used anywhere else, and how would this work for copies made of that original document?  Once a "flit" was used as a copy and then detached and re-associated with some other document several times, would each new copy carry a record of where it had been previously, so that half of the amount of space of a document would be comprised of the historical record of where that "flit" had been?
Sounds very costly.

Major problem here is that ten million horny geeks are likely to bring your server to its knees, but if one only has one image, and it is moderately small, say thirty thousand bytes, perhaps the flood would taper off eventually.
Here James has stated the crux of the problem in its basic, elementary form.   Why cannot legislators, the courts, and all those socially responsible individuals promoting the CDA and their other complaints against indecency recognize the obvious:
that the problem of the presence of (and the success of) alarmingly objectionable material on the internet is all due to the existence of all those "ten million horny geeks", who en masse can actually "bring servers to their knees".
I think this is a Male vs Male problem, and personally I think the mature and wise men of the world should take the case in hand and deal with it on a Man-to-Man basis.
Or, they could just adopt Assassination Politics and do away with all those "other people's" (horny) internet-addicted male children.

pathology to study.
Just wanted to mention that the reason Detweiler used anonymity was as a counter-example of why he opposed the use of it.  He wanted to impress upon the cpunks the points he was making against anonymity by using it in the ways which he warned could become a problem.
As he said in his recent post "detweiling", he aimed his efforts against those whom he considered the "big egos" - i.e., the ones who disagreed with him on his prognosis for the future.

@_subject: What backs up digital money? 
So I view dcash as a circulating currency, where the act of transfer in
some implementations requires some technical assistance from an agent
of the bank able to make digital signatures on its behalf.  It is more
than simply a mechanism for transferring funds from one account to
another (unless you think of government currency in those terms).  I
view it as possessing real value, as being a genuine asset in the same
sense as other forms of cash.
Real money may need to be actually in existence somewhere in the form of metallic bars or coins, but I was thinking about how most of the time for me it is just a lot of abstract Money Mumbers:
.  I get automatic deposits of Money Numbers in my bank account;
.  I go to the ATM and enter a few Money Numbers and get some representative notes, as well as a slip of paper telling me how many Money Numbers I have left in my account;
.  I go to the store and use a card which debits my account with a certain quantity of Money Numbers;
.  I promise to work for a certain quantity of Money Numbers;
.  I request loans in terms of a certain quantity of Money Numbers, etc.
Except for when I have metallic coins in my hand, t's mostly abstract and becoming more-so, so that at the accelerating speed of the circulation of Money Numbers, only the banks must be concerned over whether these are really attached to anything solid and physically meaningful.  For me and others, it's based mostly on the supposition of value (itself an abstract concept which must be learned and understood in its relation to symbolism).

Guess so.  .  How long do "cool sites" stay "hot"?
.  How long would web pages rated "sexual content" keep that rating?
.  Many sites are casually rated as "cool" for the fun of it.  .  Why are controversial pages rated?
.  What motivated Yahoo to begin featuring Top 5 Sites of the Week?
.  What motivates those who are calling for mandatory rating?
You could say that *all* communication is a rating, then.   All evaluations are ratings (as are all emotions, and all modifying terms in grammar.  Art is a rating on life, as love is a rating on others).   But an individual must decide how much screening they can tolerate before they become useless to themselves (or:  *whose* rating is important?)
Many things help us to make judgements, to aid us in arriving at conclusions.   Ratings present the conclusion itself:  rather than assisting, by reasoning and discussion (or argument) in the development of judgement,  they present a final evaluation.  They leave out the middle, where the work of thought takes place.    They can do that, in a very reduced, limited way.  I myself think that even short descriptions are more informative and useful.  You can reduce communication to such constricted labels that it loses all meaning.
Or as Beavis n Butthead would posit:  uh - uh; uh - uh
(hee-hee.  It just occurred to me how dogs mark their territory.  You could call *that* a rating, too.  THIS site is MINE, honey!!)

.  Wouldn't everyone need to have two jobs (or source of regularly accepted cash), in order to be able to pay for services where suppliers do not accept virtual cash transactions?

@_subject: FW: anonymous companies 
A company implies a particular kind of persistent structure, with a
hiearchy of owners, managers, and employees.  It is far from clear to me
that this is the most likely organizational form in an anonymous digital
economy.  One possible alternative is to have no persistent organizations. Teams form spontaneously to work on individual projects.  Each individual
member jointly negotiates a contract with every other member, and these
contracts are enforced through some arbitration system.
This "virtual corporation" is something that I've read about (about 2 years ago) which is an idea already in use -  someone has an idea for a kayak design, then he contracts out to other individuals all the different kinds of work he needs done to get it built.  As soon as the project is complete, the company dissolves.
But here is where I think the problems with an attempt at total anonymity will occur, as has been mentioned:  where the virtual meets the actual, where the anonymous electronic interaction must meet the solid real to complete the transaction.
The work of constructing physical things must be accomplished in an actual location.  If the place is rented, rather than owned, the renter will be able to identify the rentee.   Solid objects like kayaks need materials for construction.   Someone must 1) get the particular kind of material which the kayak design requires, and 2) make it available for distribution to those who will want to use it.   Material or parts buyers must be able to examine the stuff to make a purchasing decision.  These must be delivered to an actual physical location.  If large trucks are rented to deliver these things, then the drivers must know where that location actually is to deliver them.  Once the kayaks are constructed, they also must be delivered to the owner or to a store or storage building.  They must be inspected for quality and meeting design specifications.  They must be sold where individuals can look at the kayak, perhaps sit inside, and compare it with other models elsewhere (I don't think just looking at a photo on a web page will do for every purchasing decision).  Back stock requires storage and probably someone to guard the building.   Perhaps the kayak purchaser will want lessons on using the thing, in an actual river.
In all these situations, decisions must be made which require a physical presence and interaction with the material of construction, with the object of attention.  This is a point where anonymity would be very difficult and loss of confidence possible (if someone reneged on their agreements).
I can imagine total anonymity used most successfully when it is limited to activities which are totally electronic in nature, like programming, web design or ecash transfers.  The more that a virtual company requires physical contact with the construction, storage, and movement of physical goods, and the more time that it engages the individuals involved, the more difficult it will be to keep away from everyone the knowledge of who is who in relation to those things and where everything is located in physical space.
I was thinking that I couldn't see purchasing groceries anonymously (if I made the purchases myself).  Perhaps with a certain kind of store design.....still, it would be difficult.  *Someone* would see me walking out with the groceries (why does this sound so funny).

@_subject: Truth can sometimes be harmful...(talk.cpunks.truth) 
There are small truths and "big" truths - or the smaller parts of a whole, or the smaller ingredients of a complete context.   In the larger context of complete truth, although the small truth of the location where Anne Frank was hiding was harmful to her safety, it was harmful only because those who had created the war surrounding her were not prepared (did not want) to see the larger truths of reality.
In the context of such an attitude inimical to complete truth, any truth can become a threat to safety.
Analogous to the use of any weapon or tool of destruction it is not accurate to hold the truth at fault, but rather the one who interprets it and decides on what action to take based upon it.  This reminds me of those arguments on the list where that old objection against encrypting personal messages was brought up:  "what have you got to hide?", implying: do you fear the truth, do you mean to live outside the context of honesty and truth?  And the cypherpunks would counter, no - we just want to be particular about who receives it.

"Government enforced weakness":  They try to do good for the benefit of all by reducing the individual's personal efficacy, until the nation is transformed into a mass of whining weanies.  Like sitting ducks, everyone is then in the position of being totally vulnerable to corrupt government administrators.  I wouldn't think that being of no practical use to oneself would be a valuable tradeoff, given such a (frequently recurring) potentiality.
If they really wanted the nation to be strong and secure, they would actively take up the task of providing "government assisted strength", advising us on how to protect ourselves, our property, our email....perhaps evern receiving "The Briefing", so that we could all be prepared to resist (or assist in resisting) threats from pervs and terrorists, et al.

Thanks for the compliment, Sandy.
I understood what you meant.   I appreciate the general nature of truth, in spite of the possibilities for misinterpretations of or prevarications from it. Jim, a quote for you:
Substitute the word "truth" for "laws" and it makes equal sense.  We would be at the mercy of forces that we could not control, if our perceptions and interpretations could not correspond to the actual, the real, the truth.

@_subject: Truth is equivalent to law? 
So in your mind truth is equivalent to law? In the sense of the above quote
the 'laws' that are refered to are general observed regularities that we
are capable of understanding. Being a pantheist and hence seeing the entire
cosmos as all there is (and hence divine in toto), I can appreciate the
original intent (being a physicist helps a little bit).
You know how in science they speak of  "laws of the universe"?
The quote I offered had to with our capacity to know the phenomena of the world (in any amount) and consequently our ability to exert control over these universal forces (or "laws") to whatever degree.  It was not in reference to man-made laws, but to those principles of cause & effect, those natural forces, which have been identified as comprising the elements of existence in the known universe (no one can make verifiable remarks about it beyond that).
It isn't necessary to know the world in toto in order to realize the validity of some of its parts;   we are equipped with the mechanisms and abilities to achieve a useful grasp of what's going on, and what we grasp as being "true" can be satisfactorily distinguished from what is "false" (or a "mistaken assumption").
Nevertheless, the original subject of this thread was about the harmfulness in truth, not with how much of it we can grasp at any time or whether Goedel was incorrect.
I guess your argument is that we can't even discuss the properties of truth, harmful or not, because we can't even be sure that there is any truth in existence.
This makes all your robotics projects bogus exercises in futility, hmm?
The general nature of truth has to do with the difference it makes in the calculations of humans, and the consequences of those calculations upon their lives.  (like, if truth is harmful, should any human being be allowed to use it, speak it, express it, think it; put a crypto envelope around it and send it?)
