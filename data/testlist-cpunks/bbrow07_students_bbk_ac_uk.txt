A bit of wishful thinking here I think.
This is really not true at all. In fact it is far more likely (or maybe less unlikely)  that European countries would pass draconian anti-spam laws than it is in the US because they don't on the whole have the same attitude to free speech.
 > I've got spamassassin to control spam.
And so, maybe, do AOL.
The real problem with your whole argument of the last week or so is that your mail is not passing across Mallory's back yard, or through pipes beneath his house - you are  expecting him to carry it across and deliver it for you. And if he doesn't want to then he doesn't want to.
Choose one of:
- get your friends to use a different ISP
- build your own network
- get your government to take over AOL on your behalf and run it as a public utility
- Get With The Program (TM) and fix your mail so it conforms with whatever arbitrary rules AOL have set up. After all SOME people manage to mail AOL customers. In their eyes you must be doing something wrong.  How dare you stand against the Corporate Might (TM) of what Made America Great(TM)!
- use letter post
Each of the above has a downside.

It is not. Grass is stuffed full of all sorts of complicated chemicals that can cause confusion to creatures that chomp it. Not to mention nassty little silica crystals.
Lambs can eat grass because they are toughened and honed grass-killers, fitted by millions of years of evolution to survive everything the grass can throw at them.  And even then they only cope with some kinds of grass. When a cat eats grass it gets sick.
It doesn't take much intelligence to sneak up on a leaf, but it takes one hell of a digestive system to eat it.
Us mammals are downstream of a 200-million-year evolutionary race between ourselves and green plants - they evolve a new poison, we evolve to tolerate it. Then we put it in hot drinks. Why else do so many plant compounds have such powerful drug effects on animals?
At the time of writing there is no winner in sight.
It isn't impossible to imagine one side winning in the end though. The plants really did beat the bacteria way back in the Palaeozoic - wood is about the only living tissue that bacteria can't eat. Which is why there is so much coal around.  Fungi got the better of them later.
Democracy tries to get the majority of participants through to the next round of the game. Natural selection kills nearly everybody, nearly all the time. Which is why it is so effective. But, given the choice, I'll take democracy.

Well, yes. Most big corporations are in effect constitutional monarchies. Decisions are made by bureaucrats  with some oversight or direction provided by the "king" (CEO in some places, significant shareholders in others). When it all goes totally pear-shaped owners (or more likely, the banks) step in.
Yes, but in practice a lot of big companies are just like that. Whatever the paper ownership decisions tend to be made by a few large corporate owners, often banks, insurance companies, pension funds and the like; themselves run by officers and managers who share interests with the managers who run the company they own. The situation is in some ways analogous to "it doesn't matter who you vote for: the government always gets in".   In most large corporations the chain of responsibility back to individual owners is so long and so flexible that there is little real control.
Small business is different of course. You make money or you go broke.  Very direct feedback.
Emotional reactions & gut feelings about this point are one of the things that make people happier with one political camp or another.
The state-socialism that you Americans call "liberal"  tends to be supported by people who feel that their governments are more responsive to their needs or wants than corporations are. Conservatives US-style libertarians are likely to feel happier with corporations than government.  The "anti-globalisation" crows and European-style left anarchists & old-style non-Marxist socialists dislike both equally.
If I was cynical, or a Marxist, I'd say that it has a lot to do with having money. People whose wealth makes up a larger share of the whole than their vote does are more likely to feel happy about corporations than  they are about representative government.
OK, it's before noon and I've only had one cup of tea, so I'm cynical.
Yes, but, it might be that a corporation makes more money for its owners by centralising and systematising and reducing the local autonomy of business units. It's a lot easier to manage a thousand identical stores than a hundred unique ones. So from "Tyler Durden's"'s POV there might be more responsiveness from an independent  store than a chain.
Though like you said, that doesn't seem to apply to books.  Might to food though.

Anyway the real relevance of the viridian list  to the cypherpunks list is that it is about technical fixes to apparently political problems. It's saying something like:
"so you think cars (or fridges, or office buildings, or polyester pants) are destroying the world? Don't vote to ban them - all that will happen then is that only the rich (or the government, opr the military) get to own them. Instead design and build and sell better cars, kinder gentler fridges,  healthier buildings, cleaner pants, whatever. And these days, cooler, stylish, and more fun, is part of what "better" means".

Always fun when this happens.    In my home town, Brighton in England, a company with the unfortunate name of "GRIP" bought about 8 or 9 old houses to build an office. One old woman  wouldn't sell, she wanted to carry on living in her own house, so until she died it was stuck in the middle of a steel and glass office block, propped up by big wooden beams.
As you say, when the government wants to build something, it usually passes a law to kick out such recalcitrant old ladies. Except that somehow railway companies - and before them the canals, this goes back to the 18th century - always managed to get the government on their side.

Why do you care about that?  All you care about is that the intended recipient on the mail you actually see is an address you are willing to read mail for. If there is no to: field, or if the "to:" is an address you don't think is yours, just drop the mail.
Plenty of places already filter out incoming mail with no "to:" As others have pointed out, if a mechanism like this is meant to give a clue to your filters (or SpamAssassin, or whatever) that something is likely not spam: then it does not need to be of any value to the recipient. All the hash need do is indictate that the originator has thought about the recipient for long enough to make the hash. You don't really need to store the hash for any longer than a day or two (so only one spammer can use one hash), and you can't respend it because it is only good for sending messages to you.
So if this was implemented we get incentive to design a new kind of hashing algorithm, one designed to be difficult to run, because all it is needed for is to prove that someone bothered enough to spend the time. Also  it needs to map one plaintext to many valid hashes  of course as others said thats easier when you include the "from:" in the hash or allow some arbitrary field.
I still don't think it's going to happen though

That really is worth saying more often.
If we here can't agree on how to make machine voting  both robust and private, then  EVEN IF A PERFECT SYSTEM COULD BE DESIGNED it is extremely unlikely that a large number of people could be persuaded that it /was/ perfect.
So if public confidence in the mechanisms of voting is considered desirable, no electronic or digital system is viable.
 > You can run an algorithm on any subset of codes, including just

you already lost 94% of the electorate.  They are saying "huh?" and going back to whatever they were doing before the election rudely interrupted them.
Current electoral systems work - where they do - because the officials keep their hands above the table, and because members of opposing  political parties co-operate in snooping on each other, because it is in their interest to do so.
This adversarial system not only works (sort of, most of the time, in jurisdictions where the local law enforcement isn't entirely in the hands of one sector of society) but it can be made to appear to work (well enough to satisfy that minority of voters who seem to care)
And leaving aside the ritual invokation of gas ovens and 747s, this nasty socialist agrees with the burden of Tim's rant - if people don't want to vote what business is it of government to force them to vote?
If someone doesn't want to vote, that's their choice, and a tiny increment to the tiny portion of influence possessed by those of us who do vote.  So no skin of our noses. If all of you zombies give up voting than the rest of us get to choose the government, for what its worth.
As for lotteries - you want to encourage stupid people to vote?
Public holidays for voting are as bad - they are likely to lead fewer people to vote of course - just as in every other public holiday those who get off work will head for the hills or the beaches or the bars or the sports stadiums (and why not if they want to?) and those who have to work anyway will be even busier than normal.
It is enough if registration is simple and open, if there are sanctions against employers/landlords/unions/political parties/thugs in general  preventing people voting,  and if there is a postal vote scheme for people who really can't make it on the day. Most countries don't even have all that yet (big chunks of the USA didn't not that long ago), why complicate things Ken Brown

This is, roughly, how traditional Unix password security works. Reverse-engineering the encryption may or may not be possible, and   ought not to matter if you have used a strong enough method and long enough keys. And anyway, if this is running on the client machine then they already have a program that can do the work. What is possible is brute-forcing by encrypting the whole dictionary and trying every word one by one.
If your algorithm is strong enough, your key long enough, and above all if the space from which the plaintext is taken is large enough, than this sort of approach can be made sort of safe enough for most applications. But why bother?

Back in the 1970s I was on a camping holiday in what was then Yugoslavia with a friend. We arrived in Rijeka in Croatia by bus, started walking off to see if we could find a camp sight, and by the time we realised we were walking out of town the wrong way it was too late & too dark to do anything about it. So we slept on a small mound just off the road we were on.
Next morning we saw that we were on what was basically a rubbish dump, overlooking the naval harbour, with a great view of all sorts of military activities. No-one seemed to be taking any notice of us though.
In 1990 I and some colleagues were visiting a Texaco office in Houston for a work-related meeting. In the carpark we began to take some pictures of each other with the office building as background. The carpark attendant came up and demanded we stop insisting that there no photographs could be taken of the building.
Not even an industrial location, just a high-rise office building in a Houston suburb (Bellaire), in full & close view of the street, some other commercial buildings,  and dozens, if not hundreds, of private homes, and distantly visible to thousands - possibly hundreds of thousands - of people every day.

Not that often.  The usual way of making & fixing roads before the   late 19th century was - and had been for centuries - collective. At best some charity or other got people together to help out. At worst the local lord of the manor or big landowner forced a sufficiently large number of peasants to do the job.
In lots of places landowners had the duty to maintain roads across their property, and the government would force them to do it. There are lots - many thousands I think - of legal records in England way back to the middle ages
A bit different in the western parts of USA if only because so many roads there are new, but even then the vast majority either were started by government (or some other non-commercial organisation) or else taken over by government after built.
Canals and railways were mostly built by private business - and mostly came into public ownership when they went broke, often bailing out the failed investors. In both Europe and North America.

In the weeks around our big bonfire celebrations in November kids throw them in the streets for a laugh.  Though they are getting more available at other times of the year now. The other week I noticed two firework shops within a few yards of each other in leafy north London suburb of Barnet.
Some nanny-staters (usually  conservatives who fear teenagers and think that all proles should be locked in their hutches at night watching TV and eatng junk food) write to the newspapers and demand that fireworks should be banned.
The government has pathetically caved in to the extent that they intend to introduce local bans on setting off fireworks after 11pm. I don't think that public opinion would hold with the kind of restrictions on fireworks that many US states seem to have.

If these persons are involved in activities which would be disapproved of by the law, I imagine that they would be very unlikley to be anything that could be called terrorism.

Maybe the causality runs the other way. People who are more "left-wing" (whatever that exaclty might mean) are more likely to enjoy living in cities.
Over here in Britain that certainly seems to have happened. There's a churn in city populations as young adults move in to study or get jobs, then move out to suburbs or small towns later.
Some stay, and they tend to be the ones who are less politically Sometimes I think that political conservatives just don't *like* people as much.   I mean that quite literally - my most right-wing friends  are less greagarious than my left-wing friends. They keep themselves to themselves more.  They stay in doors more and when they are out they are more likely to stick to their own cars. They don't like travelling in public transport, or going to noisy pubs. They seem to actively dislike social situations where they rub up against large numbers of strangers.
And the Anarchists have the best parties. By which I mean Euro-style left-wing Sovcialist Anarchists of course, not grumpy American survivalist Libertarians.  "Get off my land!" is a characteristic right-wing stereotype. "Whose round is it anyway?" is not.  Like the old song says "As soon as this pub closes, the Revolution starts!"
In Britain, things may be different in your country, inner-city life is in many ways more old-fashioned than country life or suburban life.
Us city dwellers are more likely to walk to work or school, less likley to drive. We're more likely to use public transport. When we buy things we go to small corner shops and the shop-keepers might even know us. They might not know our names,  or even speak our language, but they probably recognise our faces.
For some time now (in England, things may be different elsewhere)   city-dwellers and inner-suburbanites have been more likely to go to church than people in the country or outer suburbs. London is the only part of Britain where churchgoing has gone up in the last ten years  (though its everywhere lower than anywhere in the USA - consistently less than ten percent)
Now teh last census tells us that one-parent families are rarer in London than in the country or in smaller towns. (See last week's Economist magazine  - full text available only to subscribers)
Also the proportion of people employed by government is smaller in London than the national average, and the proportion of self-employed or small businesses is greater.
Another thing US has in common with UK - large cities are net contributors to tax reevenues.

Sometimes I wonder if the would would be a better place if most Americans learned anything about history that happened east of New Bedford or west of the San Andreas fault.  Or that hadn't been filtered through a right-wing journalese dumbing-down small-c-conservative  small-l-liberal consensus.

Doesn't have to work like that. The mushroom cloud is not "pushed up" by blast, it's carried up by hot air rising, which is replaced by cooler air rushing in below.
There was a visible mushroom cloud at Hamburg in 1943 - I'm not sure but I suspect that that may have been the event that put the phrase into the language.
FWIW the BBC is now saying that the NKs are claiming it was a civil engineering explosion connected with a hydro project.
As with other list members I assume that if the explosion was nuclear someone would have detected EM from it immediately & radioactive particles soon after.
And I also assume, perhaps with less justification, that at least some of those someones would have made the knowledge public - it must include at least military early warning organisation of China, Russia & the US, and very possibly Japan, SK, UK & maybe other countries as well, and also probably a number of space agencies and academic researchers.  Would they all conspire to suppress knowledge of NK nuclear explosion?
And if there was such a test, how long before China stomped all over them. Last thing they want is a looney dictator with nukes on their borders (If only to pre-empt Russia, US, or Japan intervening). Even if both the Chinese state capitalists and the North Korean absolute divine monarchy still use the locally redundant word "Communist" when describing themselves to us Western barbarians.

But in most places at most times the state is run at least partly by and for the rich and the owners of property and  supports and privileges their continuing private power.
And there are circumstances where private individuals send men with guns to attack you if you  cross them.    Quite a lot of them, from the feudal barons, to drug-dealers in modern cities, to   just about anywhere out of easy reach of the state's police.
And there are places where corporations do that as well. Even well-run respectable British or American corporations that have annual reports and  shareholder's meetings.
State power and private power are different but not distinct, and everywhere more or less mixed up with each other and involved with each other, and in most places the same sorts of people have both. Economic power is a kind of political power.

More commonly states defend the rich against the poor.  They are what underpins property rights, in the  sense of "great property" - until the industrial revolution that was mostly rights to land other people farm or live on. Every society we know about has had laws and customs defending personal property (more or less successfully) but it takes political/military power to defend the right to exact rent from a large estate, and state power to defend that right for thousands or millions of landowners.
The apposite current comparison is 9/11 the most notorious piece of private-enterprise violence in recent years, and the far more destructive  US revenge on Afghanistan and Iraq. Which was hundreds of times more destructive but hundreds of thousands of times more expensive, so far less cost-effective - but in a a war of attrition that might not matter so much. Of course the private-enterprise AQ & their friends the Taliban booted themselves into a state, of sorts in Afghanistan, with a little help from their friends in Pakistan and arguable amounts of US weaponry. Not that Afghanistan was the sort of place from which significant amounts of tax could be collected to fund further military adventures.
States can get usually get control of far larger military resources than private organisations, and have fewer qualms about wasting them.  Not that it makes much difference to the victims - poor peasants kicked off land wanted for oilfields in West Africa probably neither know nor care whether the troops who burned their houses were paid by the oil companies or the local government.

That's the point of course. The idea behind the laws is to make it very inconvenient to operate in society without some supposed proof of identity. A "problem" the government will then "solve" by issuing ID cards to everyone. Which will then be made compulsory.
"Show me your papers, sir!"
The British government is taking the same line, though isn't so far along the route as you are - laws going through Parliament right now.
Interestingly they are blaming the US for the need to have them.
They started by saying it was for terrorism (which is crap as we all know), then they said it was to prevent social security fraud (which is probably part of the reason they want them, but not a big enough deal to get voters behind it), then to prevent "ID theft" (does the opposite of course by introducing a single point of failure), then to stop illegal immigration (it won't of course, it'll just make illegal immigrants even more vulnerable to exploitation by employers or worse) & now and again there has been bleating about "protecting the children" (as if rapists are going to put "I am a predatory sex criminal" on their application form)
But last week, they just blamed you. Oh they said, the Americans are demanding biometric ID from all visitors. So if you have a passport you will need it. As most British people have passports anyway, and it would be silly to have a passport that could be used anywhere but the USA, it'll save money to issue one single biometric ID for everybody...
At the moment it looks as if the pass-card laws in the UK will fail. Well not fail on paper, because the spin doctors and PR merchants won't allow that to happen, but be watered down in the House of Lords  so far that they won't have much effect. Of course that's still bad because the principle will still be there for some future government to exploit. They are desperately unpopular with the country at large - though sadly it seems to be the cost and inconvenience rather than the principle that people object to.
The Conservatives are voting against mainly because that's what opposition parties do in British politics, but if they ever get back into power you can be sure they will adopt the plan with a few minor cosmetic changes so they can pretend it has been improved. More of their MPs support it than Labour do - but party discipline being what it is in Parliament its unlikely that more than the same 20-odd Labour MPs will vote against it in Parliament.
And whenever a journalists asks a Cabinet Minister why they are spending 20 billions on flashy plastic cards (how many extra police could they employ for that money?) they say that they have to do it because the USA is making them do it.
But its not our fault. Its all those nasty Americans. Don't blame me, Mummy. The bad man made me do it.

Which are easier to spam and less secure than smtp.
SMTP is p2p by definition, though you can use servers if you want.
SMS  *IS* email , just a different kind of email - and a less secure, more expensive kind, in which the infrastructure is more in the hands of the large companies that run it and less accessible to users installing their own protections.
as we can for smtp
I suspect you don't get much traffic. The beauty of a non-real-time store-and-forward system like smtp (or SMS, or oldstyle conferencing systems with off-line readers) is precisely that  it can be automated. I don't have to see mail I don't want.
A higher proportion of the snail-mail I get is junk than the email. In fact almost all of it is (& most of what isn't is bills :-( - usually already paid by the bank)  I throw more than half of my incoming paper mail in the bin unopened, and about half of what is left is just put in a cupboard in case I get into some dispute tithe the bank or the electric company or whoever.
A higher proportion of the landline phone calls I get are junk. At least 4 out of 5 calls, maybe 9 out of 10. Email is doing quite well.
 > the ISPs will start to charge people for
Why should they charge more for qa service which is not only cheaper for them to run, but has more competition and is harder to subvert? A serious proportion of the rootkits and so on that have been plaguing us for the last few years involves chat & instant messaging & so on.  I'd block it at the boundary firewall. People who use it should just learn how to use mail.  They'd get through more. Chat is for functional illiterates. Learn to read at adult speed and you'll prefer mail. Why should they put up with being limited to someone else's typing speed?

Actually the only passports that are significantly more convenient than US or UK ones (i.e. are more likely to get you in to more places with less fuss from locals in dark glasses) are from the  northern European states without a reputation as colonialists - in particular Scandinavian countries & Ireland. Everyone likes them.
I know plenty of people who used to keep both an Irish and a British passport. Unlike you picky Americans our governments don't have any objection to people being citizens of as many places as they an get away with. And in the days of emigration (all has changed now) you could get an Irish passport if your granny had once spent a wet weekend in Downpatrick.
All our passports are being assimilated into EU ones at the moment so I don't know if this has changed.
We used to do the Israel/everywhere else thing as well and also would issue spare passports for other places that were unpopular. IIRC Pakistan at one time looked askance at passports that had been to India. South African visitors weren't popular in many countries.  And I'm pretty sure that Britain sometimes issued spares to people who wanted to go to the USA after visiting Cuba or Iran (both increasingly popular holiday destinations from here)  I strongly suspect that this has changed now that UK pass laws are taken as dictation from the USA.

Or maybe its counterpart fossil.
As GK Chesterton said about most nominal Christianity in the world in his day  - the original had rotted away leaving a space of the same shape and size. Like the impression of a leaf between two layers of mud which harden into stone leaving a fossil that has something of the shape and pattern of the original but none of its Do you really think that politics only exists where there is a state?  I'd have thought the opposite is true. Most states actively prevent most people participating in politics. And even the more benign ones relieve people of the responsibility of doing politics - or maybe  the realisation that what they are doing *is* politics. Where there is no state everyone is a politician, all the time, and all public acts are overtly political.

That seems almost the opposite of politics to me. The actual politics - the arguments, the decisions - has been done in some smoke-filled room beforehand. The public meeting is nothing more than the product launch.
Well, yes. If only because the buyer and seller are both extending the reach of their lives to influence others to behave in the way that they want. Using money in this case rather than votes or threats, but still in a sense a kind of politics.
And of course on a large scale more obviously what is more conventionally called politics - that small transaction, a dollar for a cup of coffee, multiplied by millions can cause armies to move, can set up and tear down governments, induce luxury in one place, famine in another. If we can say that war is  politics carried on by another means we can also say that markets are politics carried on by other means.
Not unless we are living as hermits.  Our entire lives involve rubbing up against other people and negotiating our relations with them. Which is basically what politics is
