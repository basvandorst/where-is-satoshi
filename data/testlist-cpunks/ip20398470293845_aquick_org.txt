It's not so much that the papers serve a purpose as it is that they
hire (and support with the resources of their organization)
journalists. Largely, bloggers are not investigative
journalists. Bloggers have a very good distribution network, and are
excellent at getting out stories where the focus is either something
public or something where a blogger has some sort of inside access
stemming from their own personal situation. But bloggers don't often
have large organizations behind them to defend their sources, which
I'd expect would be a concern when you're blowing the whistle on a
large secret government operation.
This difference is key - it takes money and free time to do the
footwork required to follow a story, verify it, research it, and
defend it if need be, and most bloggers aren't professional bloggers,
let alone professional journalists. It's a very small number of
bloggers who have the resources, training, inclination, or
connections/reputation to develop breaking news stories.
In this discourse, we should definitely be drawing a distinction
between news distribution and news origination. It's entirely possible
that this will change in the next few years, but still - the stories
have to come from somewhere.

@_subject: More detailed queries of what Google stores 
I asked two very specific questions in a conversation with John
Battelle, and he's received unequivocal answers from Google:
1) "Given a list of search terms, can Google produce a list of people
   who searched for that term, identified by IP address and/or Google
   cookie value?"
2) "Given an IP address or Google cookie value, can Google produce a
   list of the terms searched by the user of that IP address or cookie
   value?"
The answer to both of them is "yes".
