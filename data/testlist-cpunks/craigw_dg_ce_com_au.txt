Remember C2 is not out of the box. Being C2 certified means that the machine can be MADE to fulfil orange book requirements, not that it is automatically secure. A machine can have a floppy, but it must than subsequently be removed or unable to be booted before it is C2.
This is not just floppies, but CD Rom drives etc as well. It must be configured to boot from ONLY the secured devices

well here in Australia Telstra our national carrier only "garantees" 2400 baud to work. I live within 2km of the exchange and the best I have ever achieved was 22k/sec over the lines (usually about 18k). This is not what the modem tells you it is doing....but what you get as a result of testing the ACTUAL modem speed using a line analizer program. What a modem manufacturer says you get and what the line gives you are Totaly separate.

@_subject: 56 kbps modems 
That I realize that baud and bit/sec are not the same, but I feel you would
 have a hard time getting a 56k modem to work on a line that does not support 28.8k fully, let alone 33.6k. A leased line (copper pair) from telstra only supports 9.6k and costs close to ISDN.
     When the telco reinstalls the literal tons of copper cable that we have lying underground for at least 20 years in some instances that connects the exchanges, and replaces this with optic fibre preferably,  or at least higher bandwidth co-ax, we will not have 28k      In the states you have better lines and ISDN is far less expensive. For two B channels perminantly connected I have to pay about $2500/month in this country. Not many home users can pay this, thus they have to still use modems. With the lack of bandwidth to and from the exchanges, there is not a chance in hell a 56k modem will work in this country for many years.
(Australia - the lucky country...not in regards to bandwidth)

But than if ypou are doing the compressed rate 56k is not that high. There are 28.8k modems that (in theory) do 336k including compression, so 56k would be redundant. Most current modems specify they will compress to 115k, whether they ever get close to this is         ,'~``.              \|/              ,'``~.

The few months I was unemployed after I left the military because of a confict of interests I earned money by doing whatever I could get (even though I am an engineer I have worked in a petrol station). So why and for what reason sould I have to pay several 10's of thousands each year to support others. I have never taken help from the govenment, I do not feel I should have to pay as well.

That is the major problem. We have only 2 carriers in this country. The market is not being deregulated untill mid 97. Optus the other carrier has only just installed local access (rather than STD, ISDN only) and it covers ~ 11% of the population with this service. The other problem is that they use lines leased from telstra as many councils and communities are complaining about the laying of new cables (arrr joe public). In a recent case where optus decided to try and lay the cables against council wishes the council impounded several of the vehicles used.
Is it not great to live in the "lucky country". Here in Au we seem to delight in first complaining of the poor line quality, and than stop new line being installed

@_subject: Banking over the net 
For some time several Australian Banks have been interested in setting up online banking via the web. Currently the Commonwealth Bank does have online banking, but on non-internetworked servers. This requires an encrypted password.      Currently this involves logging into the bank server directly transfering the password, at which case the user has access to their accounts. The unfortunate details are that the instructions for the account are not sent encrypted. Apart from the initial password, all data is sent plain text.
      There is likely to be implemented an inital web trial of this service in December this year. Hopefully the security will be upgraded a little. Where this is not likely is that the likely canditate for encryption over the net is going to be 40bit netscape (as what bank wants to go against the wishes of the US gov).       The banks feel secure in that they are providing a 128bit secured password to the customer via mail. This seems to be the end of the security. While the average member of the public blindly trusts the banks to keep them safe, and untill there is a user friendly means of encrypting data (that the US government supports), I can see alot of room for fraud.
