Well, it was interesting to see Philippe Nave's posting about an AT&T encryption software product (using the government's digital signature
and secure hash standards instead of RSA and MD-5, so it won't be PGP-
or PEM-compatible).  Prices seemed a bit high, though not bad for AT&T,
who are cutting some new market turf as well as typically pricey,
and the encrypted Zmodem software may be useful.  Does anybody know
if there are any other SHA / government-signature products out?
(I'm assuming there won't be much freeware because of the patent
issue; people who don't mind violating RSA's patent generally use PGP.)

I consider the Sternlight-bashing suggestions to be unreasonable;
Sternlight may rave from a warped, pro-government viewpoint,
but he is capable of carrying on civilized conversations, even when
he's (continually) grinding the same axe.  The coffee-house analogy
is a very good one, and there *is* occasionally a screaming-children
problem on usenet; I assumed the original poster was referring more to
the perpetual-newbie types rather than to the newly arrived,
chronologically-deficient college students, most of whom are either
quiet, productive, or both (though a college student and the author apparently felt otherwise :-)
I still prefer having this as a mailing
list, in spite of the volume; I can read sci.crypt when I want to,
though I'll probably have to get a netcom account rather than
keep telnetting into my old system now that I've moved.
