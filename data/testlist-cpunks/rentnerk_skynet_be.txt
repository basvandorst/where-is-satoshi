What a crock of horseshit!  The 650th MI group is a counterintelligence unit; it chases spies and terrorists.  It is not an intelligence analysis organization and does not conduct signals intelligence or coordinate SIGINT wiht anybody.  This Dane was drinking too much Gamel Dansk when he wrote the story.
