Good comments, John.  My 2 cents is that sysadmins' conservative
organizations often force (or try to force) lilly-livered
I've personal and 2nd hand stories about the legal counsel or upper
management having a policy of blind cooperation with any law
enforcement, sans warrant, for any request.
Sometimes the sysadmin might choose to buck authority, but s/he
does so at peril of losing cooperation or support from the higher-ups.
So, regardless of whether the sysadmins are really lilly-livered, they might need to behave that way due to management or legal
counsel who favors saving various legal expenses or hassles over
taking the moral high road.
Bottom line, as usual, is to trust no-one, including ISPs
or sysadmins that have a strong privacy ethic.

References: <00bb01c046e5$f28dac80$a6d11018 Many people under-state the cost of bulk (paper) mail in this way.  In
fact, the cost is far greater, especially in use of natural resources.
As a rabid environmentalist, every time I get a piece of junk mail I
think of it in terms of the trees, oil (for plastic) and other
resources that went into getting it to me.  Lots of this stuff is not
recyclable, and not even safe to burn (I've been seeing lots of
reports lately about pollution due to "backyard burning").
The post office needs to deliver it.  What's the weight of the mass
mail delivered daily, and what is the proportion of fuel and other
consumables that go into getting it from place to place?
I can tell you that even with my greatly sub-typical bulk mail daily
influx, it's at least 1/2 of the weight and volume (junk catalogs
etc. tend to be bigger and heaver than "legitimate" stuff like bills.
As the USPO will tell you, the benefit of junk mail is that it
subsidizes regular mail.  Personally, I would rather pay several times
more for each letter I send and not get any junk mail.
Remember the quote in Garfinkel's Database Nation: "there is no junk
mail, only junk people."  This was from a direct mail marketer, who
stated that he had no interest in sending stuff to anyone but
potential customers.  Well, I've been working for YEARS to tell
everyone that I am a junk person, by this definition, but spammers,
direct mailers and telemarketers persist in contacting me.
I get catalogs every month from many places, even AFTER I have
contacted them to ask to be removed from their list.  A short list
includes Home Depot, Performance Cycles, MicroWarehouse and other
companies that should know better.
In many cases, the post office refuses to NOT deliver the stuff,
because it's addressed to "resident."  Unless I want to say that a
message is offensive to me and go through the USPO paperwork, there is
no way to stop this.
Of course.  Why not for paper junk mail, too?
I think maybe you haven't actually tried to get off too many paper
junk mail lists.  It is NOT easy, even when you know exactly who is
sending you the stuff.  I only think they have a right in some circumstances, and most spam I
receive doesn't meet the criteria.
- must have an opt-out & maintain a  "do not contact" list
- must participate in the DMA's opt-out list or other industry standard resources
- must have a valid Reply-to: address to an attended mailbox
This is minimal, and is completely consistent with regulations for
telemarketers and direct mail services.  The fact with phone and mail
systems is that they are (a) local or national monopolies; (b)
subsidized; and (c) regulated.  Regulations are simply a quid pro quo.
(Yes, we can argue against this sort of subsidy and regulation...for
now, we have it).
Taking the same approach to the electronic domain, which often has the
same qualities (local monopoly, subsidized and regulated), is an easy
decision to make.

I don't think you're going to get a lot of sympathy by wanting to
force people to view ads.  Although it's your bandwidth at the server
end, it's the USER's bandwidth (& time) at their end.  I nearly always
leave images turned off in Netscape so I don't need to wait for ads to
download via a modem.
Good question, I'd say the answer is 'yes' but it's but probably not
worth the effort.  Your basis would be what files they download (and
yes, it seems you could automate assessing this).
It seems that you could configure your Web server software to stop
serving data to hosts that don't also download the banner images (if
the images are coming from YOUR server; this isn't clear -- if not,
you might be able to redirect through your server to get the images).
This would also block:
public access text-only stations)
everything is downloaded
Let's assume you could catch Junkbusters users this way.  Their
workaround might be to GET the banner file, but abort the connection
before the file transfers.  Much tougher to catch..  You're be burning
far more CPU cycles than just for regular Web serving.  It's not clear
to me that the current Junkbusters (or their Guidescope) software
could do be modified to work around such blocking.
Your question was whether you could do this type of detection using a
CGI/mod_perl script.  It seems you could "tail" the server log file to
get the data you'd need (& combine with the regular client info you
can get from the Web server).  You'd also need to maintain a state
variable across multiple hits to the server so you know what clients
have downloaded the whole set of files you're testing.  Seems
feasible, but potentially error-prone.

Your argument doesn't do much for me, Seth.  The problem is,
what you say of Declan could be true of ANYONE you talk to,
journalist or not, and ANYONE on mailing lists or other forums
where you send your thoughts.
The advantage of talking to Declan is that maybe, possibly,
some "freedom of the press" issues will let him avoid spilling
everything.  In that case, you'd need to trust him to keep
your best interests.
For non-press, you'd still need to wonder whose interests they
have at heart, but without the (minimal) protection offered
by a member of the press.
More importantly, a member of the press isn't going to get a lot
of inside scoops if he develops a reputation as a turncoat.
This, to me, is the crux: It's in any journalist's interest
to be trustworthy.  In the context of cypherpunks activity,
being trustworthy means not playing into the hands of
over-zealous law enforcement techniques.  After all, the
DATA are there (that is, the Web pages, mailing list
postings, news articles, etc.).  All the Feds are looking for, in this case, is someone with credentials a judge will
listen to.
That's my logic, anyway.
Personally, on what I've read from Declan, I'd trust
him more than 99% of other journalists who write about
technological issues.  This is based on technical understanding,
as well as what I consider to be a decent track record
of standing up against authority.

demonstrate my courage by snorting a line of caffeine, followed by
some guacamole.
If I'm feeling up to pushing the edge, I may use non-organically
grown avocados.
BTW, the "This Is Your Brain on Cow" ads, which I saw while in NYC
recently, are done by McDonalds' advertising agency.  Evidently, the
real fear (but maybe this is just conspiracy theory) is that mad cow
will become so popular that McDonalds will suffer lost revenues.  This is because there are strict US FDA regulations concerning the use
of infected beef in restaraunts, but they have little to say about
what individuals in private homes eat.

PS: I hear that the Japan story is a hoax, as infected beef is
almost impossible to get there.  People pay money for the thrill,
but are really just getting marinated chicken.

I presume Reese knows a joke (mine) when he sees one, and is just
looking for info about deer & elk.  This is a story I've
heard about in several forums, including a radio show (maybe
Pacifica News, I'm not sure).
Go to  and query "bse elk deer" and you'll get
several hits covering this topic.  Whether it constitutes a
"positive link" is for you to decide.
I think Project Censored ( did a story about
this, too.  The bottom line in several of these stories is that BSE
*is* in the wild in the U.S., contrary to what Big Money (in this
case, beef producers, McDonalds, etc.) would have us believe.
Whether BSE is in US cows or elsewhere in the non-hunter human food
chain is something I haven't heard about, but it's fair to guess that
this is the type of information that would be supressed by the powers

McVeigh's Bombing Trial Cost $13.8 Million
DENVER (Reuters) - Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh (news -
web sites)'s 1997 trial in Denver cost U.S. taxpayers $13.8 million,
according to figures released on Friday by U.S. District Judge Richard
Matsch who presided over the trial.
McVeigh was executed on June 11 in a federal prison in Terre Haute,
Indiana for the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah federal building
(news - web sites) that killed 168 people and injured hundreds others.
The figure, which includes $6.7 million for 19 lawyers, only covers
expenses until Aug. 14, 1997, the day McVeigh was sentenced to die.
In cases where defendants cannot afford to pay for their own defense,
the U.S. taxpayer picks up the tab.
Costs for support staff for the attorneys, housing and security came
to nearly $1.5 million and investigators were paid nearly $2 million.
A little more than $3 million was paid to experts who testified in the
trial on McVeigh's behalf.
Travel expenses added up to $541,885, although some of that expense
also covered work done for McVeigh's former army buddy and
co-defendant Terry Nichols who was tried separately and sentenced to
life in prison for his role.
The court expects to release figures on the cost after the sentencing,
but no date has been set for that, Matsch's spokesman, James
Manspeaker said.

Evidently, this was covered on BBC Newsnight.
Extracting a 3DES key from an IBM 4758
The IBM 4758 is an extremely secure crytographic co-processor. It is
used by banking systems and in other security conscious applications
to hold keying material. It is designed to make it impossible to
extract this keying material unless you have the correct permissions
and can involve others in a conspiracy.
We are able, by a mixture of sleight-of-hand and raw processing power,
to persuade an IBM 4758 running IBM's ATM (cash machine) support
software called the "Common Cryptographic Architecture" (CCA) to
export any and all its DES and 3DES keys to us. All we need is:
    * about 20 minutes uninterrupted access to the device
    * one person's ability to use the Combine_Key_Parts permission
    * a standard off-the-shelf $995 FPGA evaluation board from Altera
    * about two days of "cracking" time
The attack can only be performed by an insider with physical access to
the cryptographic co-processor, but they can act alone. The FPGA
evaluation board is used as a "brute force key cracking"
machine. Programming this is a reasonably straightforward task that
does not require specialist hardware design knowledge. Since the board
is pre-built and comes with all the necessary connectors and tools, it
is entirely suitable for amateur use.
Besides being the first documented attack on the IBM 4758 to be run
"in anger", we believe that this is only the second DES cracking
machine in the open community that has actually been built and then
used to find an unknown key!
Until IBM fix the CCA software to prevent our attack, banks are
vulnerable to a dishonest branch manager whose teenager has $995 and a
few hours to spend in duplicating our work.  Contents

2600 DMCA APPEAL LOST - FELTEN LAWSUIT THROWN OUT
Posted 28 Nov 2001 22:39:50 UTC
A decision has come down in our DMCA appeal in the 2nd Circuit Court
of Appeals. We lost.
The text of the decision is now available and Judge Kaplan's decision
of August 2000 was upheld.
We will update this story as we continue to learn more. And we want to
thank everyone who has continued to support us in this long and
difficult battle.
The decision is linked at I've read through it (71 pages).  The Court of Appeals seems
to have done a thorough job of considering the arguments of
both sides.  They want to take a narrow interpretation of the
1st ammendment, in order to allow new developments of law
concerning electronic media to emerge.  They were thoroughly convinced that computer code is speech,
whether in object form, source code or something else.  They
devoted many pages to defending this position.  But they
also distinguished the functional from the speech elements of
a run-able program (following Judge Kaplan), and believe that
the functional component, which essentially can break the law
without a user doing much other than running it, lessens
1st ammendment protection.  Like Kaplan, they think providing a clickable hyperlink to download
a file on another site is the same as providing that file on
your site.
They don't seem to think that fair use implies any particular ability
to copy in a way the customer chooses - seeming to say that the
copyright owners can dictate what constitutes fair use.
I'm looking forward to seeing a more complete analysis by
someone with better credentials than I have...the above
are just a few things I noticed.

Some electronic journals, some conferences and some print journals
now let authors retain copyright or, if they keep copyright,
allow authors to do what they please with their work.
It's far more typical, though, for the journal to get all rights,
except perhaps classroom use (aka "fair use") by the author.
(And then charge the author's institution a fortune to subscribe
to the same journal.)
I think that there are still some journals iwth these "page charges,"
in which the employer or (more likely) some grants are expected
to pay for publication.  This was prevalent in the sciences, not
arts and humanities.
I never had to pay any, but information science (me) is more like a
social science than a hard science in many ways.
I *have*, this year, been told that a journal would be happy to
publish my screen shots in color for a few $thousand per page,
but would do them in B&W free.
Not much has changed, other than continued price rises and consolidation
in the publishing industry.  Ejournals are making in-roads, especially
in some fields, and are breaking some patterns.  Print publishers are
working to "extend and embrace" some of the new models.
Meanwhile, academic libraries are undergoing a continued "serials

any other cost.  There was (maybe still is?) a boycott of some
Elsevier products for some of their more eggregious pricing.
