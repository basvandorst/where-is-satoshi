Umm, I guess you could make mount setuid root or something. Is this
just a linux thing? But wait, there's more.  There's nothing to prevent root from grabbing your password when you
log in. Root can see *everything.*
If a user on the system has your password, they can edit your .login
to give them your filesystem password. If they have the root password,
well, you're screwed.
AKAIK, the only benefit od encrypted drives is that the sysadmin
cannot be forced to reveal the contents of the drive (5th amendment
and all). You could do the same thing on a multiuser system by having
one encrypted partition, and making symlinks from each user's
directory to their directy in the encrypted drive. This would be a bit
more efficient, I think.
