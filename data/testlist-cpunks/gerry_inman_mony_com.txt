Someone (probably you) has requested that SpamCop email you an
authorization key.  You may use this key to send spam reports via
SpamCop.  Never post this URL publicly or share it with others.  If
you do, anyone who sees it will be able to impersonate you and send
email via SpamCop as if they were you.
Here is your authorization key:
Put this URL into your web-browser.  Once you get to the SpamCop site,
bookmark that page.  Then just use the bookmark to return when you get
some spam.
If your system has somehow mangled the above URL, you may get an error
instead of the correct results.  If you do, you can complete the process
manually by visiting this page:
And entering your authorization code manually:

Thanks for helping rid the internet of spam!
