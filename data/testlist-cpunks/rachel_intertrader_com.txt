This is one of the more novel ideas that Digital have come up with for
Millicent. In return for allowing the advertiser to download their advert to you, you
get credited with an amount of scrip which is redeemable at their site. An interesting concept...

@_subject: UK cryptography list 
Are you familiar with the  list, which covers
this field rather well already? I think it's a majordomo server, so a mail to majordomo at maillist.ox.ac.uk
with the body text "subscribe ukcrypto" would get you in...

@_subject: FAQ? how to set up a cross-platform encrypted mailing list/forum 
This might be a FAQ. Or it might just be a question with a really obvious answer that I can't see for looking.
How can I set up a mailing list or online forum with encrypted traffic?
The clients are varied platforms: Win98, WinNT, OpenBSD, FreeBSD.
I thought about tweaking the listserver to send out encrypted mails. But that doesn't help the inbound traffic.
I thought about using some online forum. But the only one I can find which looks to make any mention of the word security is Groove. Which is Windows I thought about setting up a VPN between the various mailservers. But we'd have to secure all the MX hosts to be sure, and some of them aren't adminstratively accessible by me. and anyway one of the potential users uses a public ISP,
so um, help! is this a FAQ with no answer? or is this a question with an answer so obvious I'll blush when I'm told what it is...
All suggestions welcome...

@_subject: FAQ? how to set up a cross-platform encrypted mailing 
The problem I see with doing this, is that it doesn't stop someone absent-mindedly sending out an unencrypted mail to the list server. Which then will travel happily in the clear over the Internet to the list server, (where it gets encrypted and sent back out again but its too late by then).
so I'm coming round to the idea that the only way to do this is via a web-driven interface on a secure server.
