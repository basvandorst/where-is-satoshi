Does this mean that if a woman calls me in response to an ad I place
in a 'Personals' column, that I can track her down and rape and murder
her, even though she is using a mobile cellular phone for her own
Being a violent sexual pervert with a long history of sexual predetation
I can certaily vouch for the fact that having a hard-on with no victim
in sight is an emergency, regardless of whether or not THOSE CHEAP
WHORES ARE TRYING TO HIDE BEHIND THE PHYSICAL ANONYMITY OF A CELLULAR
Thank Dog that those in charge of monitoring the F(ucking) C(ock-teasing) C(unts) using cellular phones are finally providing
myself and my cellmates with a way to locate THOSE STINKING BITCHES
AND MAKING THEM *PAY* FOR THE SINS OF *ALL* THE MOTHERS WHO LEAD
THEIR CHILDREN ON AND THEN REFUSE TO PUT OUT FOR THEM!!!!!
