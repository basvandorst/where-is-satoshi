Ah, so I'm not the only one who makes nefarious use of R&D4 (Burning Man, Mike Jittlov, and other pseudo-events) ;-)
Looking forward to it.
The press is a little difficult to believe when they come out with nonsense like  "Apple is finally upgrading an aging product line".
Excuse me?  Yes, the last new Mac one could buy was the IIfx?

Is there a way to get a .plan file to execute shell script when
it is read by finger??
I'm sure this is an old question, but it seems there must
be a way.
echo \"date\"  or some damn thing that will execute as opposed
to printing.
The fingerD I am working with does not seem to call
a .fingerrc file.
