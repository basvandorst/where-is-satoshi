True. But that's only one scenario in which such biometrics profiling
could be used. I don't know of any bank that uses that, though. Anywhoo…
Another worrying scenario is using keypress timings to profile netizens
in addition to other ways of recognizing them (be it User-agent string,
Adobe Flash player + system font list, HTML5  element). I thing
we should try to think of ways to mitigate this attack.

There are browser extensions that do that, although they probably were
meant solve another problem (ie. let's use my fav text editor to write
this long piece in a form). rysiek was linking to:
  (also "set editor=…" setting in ~/.vimperatorrc)
How so?
Vimprator is king, I agree. Unfortunately not a viable option for many.
