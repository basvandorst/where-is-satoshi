Just because something is unconstitutional doesn't mean that learned judicial appointees will find it unconstitutional. When domestic GAK is passed, it will be structured to fit into the judicial philosophy of the day.
This is under the same philosophy that says television shows are not speech, but rather a commercial enterprise. If the courts were first amendments absolutists, like the persons on these two lists, there would be no problem seeing porn on primetime TV. There would also be no V-chip law.
When they manage to get the political conscensus, they will pass it. Incidentally, I remind you of the results of the moot court that was held at one of the CFP conferences, where a GAK case was tried in front of real federal judges by real lawyers. Our side lost.

Rant ahead.
Doubtful. Under the current situation our technoilliterate oppononents are
passing demonstrably unworkable and heavy-handed laws, which, if the CDA
was any indication, have a high chance of being at least partly
neutralized in the courts and the benefit of being a headache to
implement technologically and commercially. If our opponents institutionalize the regulation of the Net, including a
GAK law, on the other hand, the policy will have the benefit of an entire
federal bureaucracy working behind it day by day to make it workable and
turn it into something acceptable to the judiciary and to those who are
seeking compromise. We will then have another FCC, but this time with its own pet FBI, and
given enough time (these people are essentially government employed
full-time lobbyists) everyone but us nutty libertarians will regard their
methods as common practice and something without which the Net would be
unlivable. Society will once again fall for the fallacy of government
necessity and we'll get divided and conquered.  Just ask the average
person what they think of abolishing the FCC and you will see what I mean. In the long run a new dedicated bureaucracy would be the worst of all
possible choices, first because it would actually function and second
because it would never go away. 3 semi-bad years instead of a couple of scary years of GAK being fought
head-on, in exchange for a permanent problem. Locking the rest of us out. Divide and conquer.
