Those were the words beaming on the cover of this week's _Information
Week_. The totally worthless article on internet security contained
this little gem:
Federal Law enforcement agencies, alarmed by the growing threat of
Net-related security breaches and crimes, are stepping up their
investigations of online intrusions. "We're aware that this is a
serious problem for any industry using the Internet," says Jim
Freeman, special agent in charge of the FBI's San Francisco office.
"The ultimate solution will be through better technology such as
encryption, but we will investigate any crimes in which a computer is
used as an instrument of intrusion or fraud.

Yes, but isn't there a fundamental difference here? Cypherpunks are
pushing for the spread of encryption to enhance our personal
freedom. But when the FBI says that "the real solution is through
better technologies such as encryption," they fail to mention that
they wish to restrict personal freedom through such things as
GAK. This is why it is so ironic that he is draped in the flag. "It's
the FBI: crusaders in defense of the first amendment!"
