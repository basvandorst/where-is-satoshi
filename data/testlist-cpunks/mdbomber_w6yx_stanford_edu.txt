@_subject: licence plates seen 
I saw a couple interesting licence plates on cars at work.  One was
Now, that's a valid ordinary sequentially issued plate.  But I'd still say
the owner of that one has the right idea. :-)
Another one on a car I've seen many times is
68 ASCII
I don't have an ASCII chart available.  What does this one mean?

I think it's an Oldsmobile of some kind.  Possibly the owner's initial.
I see that car often.  If I ever run into its driver I'll have to
remember to ask what the significance of the 68/'D' is.

I knew it probably was a joke of some kind, but I didn't get it.  Thanks for
enlightening me. :-)

@_subject: archives request 
Are there any archives of this list?  My email service has been unreliable
and I have probably missed most of December and January.
Please respond by direct email to w6yx - mail from the list to me isn't getting to me for some reason.

@_subject: Wide Spread use of PGP 
This is what I do.  I connect to the net through SLIP and then use Eudora to
retrieve my mail from a DECstation.  PGP is secure that way.  However, the
password to attach to the POP server goes out in plaintext, and was undoubtedly
compromised in the packet-sniffing incident we heard so much about.
I have been trying to look into alternatives to plaintext passords flying
around, but have only confused myself.  What is available?

@_subject: FWD: RIPEM/SIG - Worldwide Digital Signature Software 
I tried turning RIPEM Mac loose on this message and it complains about a
garbled Originator Certificate, then complains that it does not appear
to be a PEM/RIPEM message.
Did anyone else get this to work?
