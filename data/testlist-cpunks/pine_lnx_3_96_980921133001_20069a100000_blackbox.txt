A question : How does the legitimate user find his password?

Another naive question: Why is the remembered secret not sufficient
(thus doing away with the magic)?

If the 'mathematical magic' is not to be kept secret (as in principle
shouldn't for all crypto algorithms) then presumably one could
attack through brute forcing the 'remembered secrect', I guess.
(I suppose the 'remembered secret' has less bits then the 'password'
that is to be retrieved from the pool of millions with the
'mathematical magic'). So the advantages of the scheme appear to
remain unclear as a matter of principle.

I remember someone wrote of the case where the attacker got the
file with the millions of passwords. Then if he also knows the
'mathematical magic' he could presumably do offline work. So I
suppose that the 'mathematical magic' has to be kept secret, which would work against the generally accepted crypto principles.

I suppose you misunderstood me. I mean the 'mathematical magic'
cannot be made public. (Or is 'online protocol' = 'mathematical magic'?)
If the 'magic' is public then the attacker with the pool of passwords
could brute force offline.

In that case please allow me to go back to a point raised by me
previously. The user uses his 'remembered secret' (of fewer bits) through a public algorithm (including protocol) to retrieve from a pool the password (of more bits). If the attacker doesn't have the pool then everything looks fine. But if he manages to get the pool
(a case someone mentioned in this thread) then he can obviously
brute force offline, I believe, since he possesses now everything
the legitimate user has, excepting the 'remembered secret'. Or is
there anything wrong with my logic?

Please kindly explain. I like very much to learn from my errors.
Thank you very much in advance.
