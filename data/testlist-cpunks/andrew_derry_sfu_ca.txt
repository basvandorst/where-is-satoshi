I'm for the digest format.  Should make it much more managable.

@_subject: A minor experimental result 
Seems quite possible to me..  I think that's why it was suggested a while
back that as many remailers be set up as possible.  That way, one could use
several in a row and virtually eliminate the problem.
I don't think you'd have to worry much about compromising the recipient, if
you encrypt the message with with her public key (except possibly traffic
analysis, which I doubt poses a problem to very many people, and which can
be overcome anyways).
Well, it would probably be ok if a lot of other people used your remailer..
but if you were the only one, I doubt it would be very effective.
