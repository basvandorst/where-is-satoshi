All machine on the same PHYSICAL network will.
If the university is worried about password sniffing, they should put
the machine on a bridged ethernet segment.  If they're really concerned,
give them their own subnet and apply an appropriate routing policy.  This
is not difficult.
It never was a secret.

@_subject: if this is RC4 
If it is, then the person who did it has gone to a lot of trouble to make
the source layout and coding style very similar to the publicly available
MD[245] sources.  Compare them and you'll see what I mean.  One of the original
reasons I thought that this was a fake was the similarity (adds credibility),
but when it was verified I began to think that this is, in fact, the real
from RSADSI.  I don't think that this is a reverse engineering job, because
I can't see any motive for anyone to put the work into making the code look
so similar.
I think that we must bear in mind that most of us are familiar with block
ciphers, and that there aren't a lot of stream ciphers out there which are
widely used right now.  The only others I know of are the various LFSR's
(which are pretty simple themselves), and that alleged early prototype
A5 (which was itself a group of LSFR's too).

This is absolutely correct.  Keeping your secret key a secret _is_
security by obscurity, although in a much wider context than most people
would use the term.  In addition, it is also particularly effect if what
is being obscured is sufficiently secure already, as it just adds another
layer of protection.
For example, if I decided to superencrypt using some publicly known
and reasonably trusted ciphers (let's say DES, LOKI and IDEA), and decided
to keep the algorithms I had used and the order I had used them a secret,
I have _not_ decreased my security.  The obscurity does not deduct from
the security of these already moderately trusted ciphers, and the work
which would have to be added to figure out what I have done increases it
(although by an amount which is probably arguable).
I am sure that this is a point almost everyone here understands this
concept, but it's amazing how many times the argument "it's a secret,
therefore it's insecure" comes out.  It's only really insecure if the
thing you're keeping a secret is, and even then you have not decreased
it's effective security by obscuring it.
The TLA's understand this concept well, which is one of the reasons they
classify almost everything they do.  One non-obvious fact is that in the
environment most governments use crypto (eg. widely distributed sites with
key distribution channels which are more easily compromised than the
crypto hardware), that the design of the cipher may be easier to keep
secret than the key itself.  As such, the use of security by obscurity
in the design of the cipher itself is a lot more effective than most
people would give it credit for.

That same general style, yes, but not to the extent this code is similar.
Indeed, I would hazard a guess and say that the RC4 code and the RFC MD[245]
code were both written by the same author, based on their layout, variable
name choice and general coding style.   Do a side-by-side comparison and you
will see what I mean.

@_subject: thoughts on RC4 
One of the issues I looked at over the weekend was the parallelization of
the key scheduler, which is definitely a non-trivial problem.  One thought
that did occur to me was that there might be a massively parallel
solution to this which has a practical implementation up to 48 bits,
but not over this.  I'll post more about this when I get some time, but
I've got to disagree with Bill here that a simple RC4 implementation (without
a parallel key schedule setup) would take more die area than a DES cracker.
Ultimately, it is a VERY simple cipher, and the VLSI implementation would
reflect this.
Even so, the release of the algorithm confirms the RSADSI position that
an exhaustive keysearch would be a slow operation, given the setup
time required for the key schedule setup.
BTW, just an idle question: why is RC4 a stream cipher, as opposed to an
8-bit block cipher?  Based on the implementation, it would seem to be the
later to me.

But the US government over the past decade have made several moves which
tend to indicate that they DO consider their juristiction to pass their
borders.  If memory serves me correctly, the original US Crime Bill also
included sections which made the killing of a US citizen outside the US
a crime (punishable by death no less), which is clearly an extension of US
laws past US borders.  And let's not forget Panama.
A small aside, but a couple of years back I was the system admin on an
educational political simulation run over the Internet between Macquarie
University, Georgetown University and another University in Texas which
will remain unnamed to protect the guilty.  During the setup phases, the system
admin from Texas informed us that he had setup an alias called "world".
Sadly, he could not understand the hilarity at the Georgetown and Macquarie
ends when we discovered that "world" consisted of only accounts in Texas.
Fortunately, the next time we played the simulation we got a much better
system admin who realised that there was physical existance past the Texan

As I recall, Matthew Gream just posted the results of several months
of investigation into Australia's crypto laws, which is probably the
most definitive summary available to date.  It is a superb piece of
work, but the thread died swiftly.
I also posted a summary of SENECA in sci.crypt (compiled with the help of DSD),
which is the Australian government classified DES replacement, and there
were were no followups there either.
One can only presume from all this that the interest is not really there.
I suspect, unfortunately, that you're right.  It's like taking cooking
tips from Lucretia Borger (sp?).

I don't know about that, but I do know that the building is completely
TEMPEST shielded.  It was custom built for DSD 2-3 years ago, when they
moved to Canberra from Melbourne.
DSD provides both COMSEC and COMPUSEC, and is surprisingly open about
SIGINT too.  I must admit that I have found them to be surprisingly
helpful on most occasions, although they do take security VERY seriously.

Law Enforcement Advisory Committee.  That might have been my mistake,
as I once did miscall them that.
Not much, no.  They're heavily secretive, and my understanding is that
they consist of representatives of the Attorney General's department,
ASIO and the Australian Federal Police.  They were mentioned to me
in passing as one body which might have a lot of interest in controlling
domestic cryptography, and I also understand that they were involved
in the deliberations over the A5/1 and A5/2 decision (which, I am told by
Austel - Telecommunications  watchdog - was quite different to what was
reported on the Internet).  I must admit to finding myself quite irritated
that bodies like the LEAC (which are, after all, advising government on
domestic policy) are so secretive.

Remember that what is being secured here is almost certainly a stronger
cipher than any of us have access to (representatives of TLA's excepted :),
and so the public scrutiny issue does not arise.
I agree with Black Unicorn's phrase: security by obscurity alone is no
security.  If we need a buzzphrase - which itself is questionable - then
that's about a close as we'll get.

This had an interesting side-effect in the GSM specifications, as there was
a lot of dispute about how secure GSM should be.  As West Germany (as it was
then) had a lot of borders with the Eastern Bloc, they wanted very
strong crypto.  France wanted very weak crypto.  Considering the players
involved, you can imagine the rest.
A5 ended up being based on a French design, so I think we can draw the
obvious conclusions.  Although I have been told that the A5 implementation
available on the network bears little relation to the final one
released in GSM, I believe that the current feeling is that it has
a key entropy of 40 bits maximum, if that.

Has anyone else noticed how this exact phrase keeps popping up time
and time again?  I for one don't consider it axiomatic, and have
grave doubts that LEO's do have a legitimate SIGINT requirement at all.
It looks like the opposition are formulating their own catch-cries now.
