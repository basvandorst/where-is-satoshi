@_subject: Netscape question transformed 
I see.  Who has netscape retained to review its software.  Can we have some public names who will vouch for the "partial testing coverage" before exposing it to the world??  Firms who will put their name on the line and say that Netscape meets all of the security guidelines say of the IETF -- the Internet Engineering Task Force??
Or does Netscape feel that International judgement will not matter??
All the more reason I guess to stick to standard.  Or don't you agree??
We're not asking you to re-create every possible configuration, but have you benchmarked Netscape against any standards at all??  And which ones??
This is true.  You can't visit every web page.  So what assumptions did you start off with when you first started your code design??  Did you read the appropriate memorandums upon which the Internet is built?
Did you assume that every server would be trustworthy??  That would be
extremely negligent.  That's like a bank trusting everyone who comes in
and asks if the bank can cash a check for them.
Any comments, Netscape??  Or are you still not making "official" statements.
