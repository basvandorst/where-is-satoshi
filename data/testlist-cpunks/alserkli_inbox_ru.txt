In fact, it is possible to setup it all thru privoxy alone:
#  5. FORWARDING
#  =============
#  This feature allows routing of HTTP requests through a chain
#  of multiple proxies. It can be used to better protect privacy
#  and confidentiality when accessing specific domains by routing
#  requests to those domains through an anonymous public proxy (see
#  e.g.  Or to use a caching
#  proxy to speed up browsing. Or chaining to a parent proxy may be
#  necessary because the machine that Privoxy runs on has no direct
#  Internet access.
#  Also specified here are SOCKS proxies. Privoxy supports the SOCKS
#  4 and SOCKS 4A protocols.
#  5.1. forward
#  ============
#  Specifies:
#      To which parent HTTP proxy specific requests should be routed.
#  Type of value:
#      target_pattern http_parent[:port]
#      where target_pattern is a URL pattern that specifies to which
#      requests (i.e. URLs) this forward rule shall apply. Use /
#      to denote "all URLs".  http_parent[:port] is the DNS name or
#      IP address of the parent HTTP proxy through which the requests
#      should be forwarded, optionally followed by its listening port
#      (default: 8080). Use a single dot (.) to denote "no forwarding".
Btw, I guess everybody who installs tor with privoxy has to know about
this since he has to change this section.
The problem is that it is not clear how to protect against `malicious'
sites: if you separate fast and tor-enabled sites by the site's name,
e.g., tor for search.yahoo.com, and no proxy for everything else,
yahoo can trace you thru images served from .yimg.com; OTOH if you
change proxy `with one click' first of all you can easily forget to do
it, but also a site can create a time-bomb -- a javascript (or just
http/html refresh) which waits some time in background (presumably,
until you switch tor off) and makes another request which allows to
find out your real ip.

@_subject: QNAP backdoor 
The premium and new line of QNAP network storage solutions allow for
full hard disk encryption. When rebooting, the user has to unlock the
hard disk by supplying the encryption passphrase via the web GUI.
However, when the hard disk is encrypted, a secondary key is created,
added to the keyring, and stored in the flash with minor obfuscation.
Additional Weaknesses:
The backdoor key is generated by rand() calls. As the rand() function
produces random numbers unsuitable for cryptographic keys. The
cryptographic strength of this generated key is approx 2^32, hence
feasible for breaking. This would make access to the flash
Original Vendor FUD:
"The functionality for encryption the hard disk does not include a
crypto backdoor."
(in response to a user question why two keyslots are allocated, and if
this is because of a backdoor)

We empirically evaluate the effectiveness of hard
  drive-oriented techniques and of the SSDs' built-in
  sanitization commands by extracting raw data from the SSD's
  flash chips after applying these techniques and commands. Our
  results lead to three conclusions: First, built-in commands
  are effective, but manufacturers sometimes implement them
  incorrectly. Second, overwriting the entire visible address
  space of an SSD twice is usually, but not always, sufficient
  to sanitize the drive. Third, none of the existing hard
  drive-oriented techniques for individual file sanitization are
  effective on SSDs.

It is also harder to rely on SSD as evidence.
  Digital evidence is increasingly relied upon in computer
  forensic examinations and legal proceedings in the modern
  courtroom. The primary storage technology used for digital
  information has remained constant over the last two decades,
  in the form of the magnetic disc.  Consequently,
  investigative, forensic, and judicial procedures are
  well-established for magnetic disc storage devices (Carrier,
  2005). However, a paradigm shift has taken place in technology
  storage and complex, transistor-based devices for primary
  storage are now increasingly common. Most people are aware of
  the transition from portable magnetic floppy discs to portable
  USB transistor flash devices, yet the transition from magnetic
  hard drives to solid-state drives inside modern computers has
  so far attracted very little attention from the research
  community.
  Here we show that it is imprudent and potentially reckless to
  rely on existing evidence collection processes and procedures,
  and we demonstrate that conventional assumptions about the
  behaviour of storage media are no longer valid. In particular,
  we demonstrate that modern storage devices can operate under
  their own volition in the absence of computer instructions.
  Such operations are highly destructive of traditionally
  recoverable data.  This can contaminate evidence; can
  obfuscate and make validation of digital evidence reports
  difficult; can complicate the process of live and dead
  analysis recovery; and can complicate and frustrate the post
  recovery forensic analysis.
  Our experimental findings demonstrate that solid-state drives
  (SSDs) have the capacity to destroy evidence catastrophically
  under their own volition, in the absence of specific
  instructions to do so from a computer.
