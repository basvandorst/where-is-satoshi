@_subject: Clinton blathering about Internet 
Get real dude. Of course it's blathering. Either he really is that stupid
or he's trying to appeal to people's ignorant fears about the Net as some
sort of Satanic gathering place, just to get reelected.
Personally, I think that his intelligence is way over rated. He's turning
out to be just another hillbilly redneck in the White House. First
Clipper, then censorship, now fear mongering. I can't believe that a
former pot smoking, philandering, draft dodger could be such a dupe. Or is
it dope.
Letting the Republicans? Clinton's on their side all the way.
