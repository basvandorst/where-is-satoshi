I enjoyed the show as well...I was a bit young when the Altair was first
published in Radio Elec., but that didn't stop me from trying to build one.
I recall spending 100's of hours piecing it all together - it all made
sense when I 'wrote' 3 hours of code to add a stack of numbers together.
It was (and still is) and addictive feeling to think (back then) "Wow, I
just did the same thing they were doing with Eniac in my bedroom!"
Now then, if we can only get Hollywood to accurately portray computers in
films...there's a hack. ;)
BTW-If you are still 'caught up' in the innovative 'demo or die' theme the
show portrays check out the following site ( - I'm sure
many of you have already been there? Are there any "Be" developers here?
What are your thoughts?

I agree with you...(re:Apple II was a toy)...
        Eniac, by comparison was also a toy...(I wonder how many lives it
        Heck, Eniac has it 'all over' the Abacus - Gosh, those darn
Babylonians seem so primitive nowadays!

@_subject: Fuseable Links - no guarantees?? 
I have never paid much attention to the protection of firmware or the
technical issues revolving around such schemes...was wondering:
I recently saw an add for a UK based group that says they can take a PIC
OTP micro and read the prom (for a fee, of course) - How the heck is this
done?? I have my suspicion that they (somehow) magically peel off the
ceramic coating (without destroying the chewy center), get a circuit mask
and 'micro probe' the I/O of the IC...they then download the secret recipe
to the afore mentioned 'chewy center'.
Is this close to accurate?? How is it 'done' ???

I was under the impression that a fuseable link was literally a
piece of conductive material that you deliberatley 'blow-away' - In most
cases, couldn't you simply 'tap into' the data side of the fuse, and
download the info??

Yep....I guess my age was showing  ;-)
