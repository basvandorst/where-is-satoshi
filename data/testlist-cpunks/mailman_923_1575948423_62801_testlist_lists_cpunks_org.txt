   looks like Openswan is going to be a good, strong open source IPsec
   project going forward. Novell and SUSE have jumped in with Astaro to
   back the project and move it along. [2]See the press release. The
   Openswan project is at [3] SUSE Linux and
   Astaro Security Linux both use FreeS/WAN in their current releases. It
   will be very interesting to watch what they do now with Openswan!"
