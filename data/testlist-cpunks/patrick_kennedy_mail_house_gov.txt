Thank you for your recent e-mail message to my office.  Your views are very
important to me, and I appreciate you taking the time to share your comments
and concerns.  I like to respond individually to every letter, phone call,
and e-mail message sent to my office.  However, because of a variety of
reasons, I am unable to respond via e-mail.  If you included your address in
your e-mail, I'll be writing you back via the U.S. Mail shortly.  If you did
not included an address and would like a reply to your message, please send
me your full name and mailing address along with your concern.
Additionally, for security reasons, please keep in mind that I am unable to
open and read attachments to any e-mail.  Once again, thank you for contacting me, I appreciate hearing from you.
