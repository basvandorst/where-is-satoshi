Well, for the mathematically curious, here are a few other interesting
prime number theroms:
For any number n which is prime, (2^n)-1 is also prime (Mersenne's theorem).
For any number n (2^(2^n))+1 is prime. (I might have that wrong, I don't
remember exactly)
For any number n, if the square root of (n!)+1 is an integer, it is also
prime.  (This is interesting, but rather useless in practice)
