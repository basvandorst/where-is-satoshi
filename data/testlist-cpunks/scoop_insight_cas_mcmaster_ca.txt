@_subject: hoping to obtains copies of documentation ... 
There are two informative documents available from GEMPLUS (France)
as part of their development kit for their GPK4000 smartcard.
   1. GPK4000 Application Notes (for public key applications)
   2. Electronic Purse Architecture for MPCOS-EMV
Unfortunately, it the kit costs more than US$4k.
Any chance some kind soul could forward a copy of these documents?
If so, email me directly to make arrangements.
