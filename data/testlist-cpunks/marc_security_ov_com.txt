   IMHO, the relevant section of the GPL, version 2 -- assuming that this
   is the version of the license Mike Ingle intends -- is as follows:
    >   7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
    >   ....
Um, keep reading:
      8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
    certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
    original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
    may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
    those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
    countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
    the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
If you read the GPL carefully, you will notice that it does not
require me to freely redistribute something I put under GPL to anyone.
What it does say is that once I give it to someone, I cannot restrict
what they do with it.  So, if someone wants to export the GPL DES
implementation I write, they can feel free.  But I have no
responsibility when the State Dept comes knocking on their door.
The GPL also requires that if I give you an executable, I must make
source available to you, or to anyone to whom you give the
executeable.  This could be a potential problem.  Programs which use
DES for authentication or integrity but not confidentiality have been
approved for export.  If such a program were distributed under
copyleft, it still couldn't be published outside the US, since the
GPL requires that if I give the executeable to a person (even in
Iraq), that I must give them source if they ask.  The underlying DES
source, since it could be used for confidentiality, would be
export-controlled.  Here, I just incorporate a limitation as in
section 8, restricting distribution to the US only.
So, kpj at sics.se, Mike Ingle's answer to you should be "I'm sorry, but
the Government won't let me give you anything."  This does not violate
any clause of the GPL.  If you think it does, please spell it out; I'm
unable to determine anything.
(Of course, I Am Not A Lawyer.)

Organization: ViaCrypt div Lemcom Systems
You recently contacted ViaCrypt and asked for information about
ViaCrypt PGP, and that it be sent to you electronically.
ViaCrypt PGP Version 2.4 for MS-DOS is now available for shipment. Appearing below is information from our literature, along with
details about ordering ViaCrypt PGP.
        ViaCrypt Introduces...          ViaCrypt(tm) PGP(tm)
                                        Pretty Good Privacy(tm)
        Protect The Privacy Of Your Files And E-Mail Messages
        =====================================================
Your files and messages.  They're personal.  They're private.  And
no one's business but yours.  You may be planning a political
campaign, preparing your taxes, or negotiating a contract. Whatever it is, you don't want your private electronic mail
(e-mail) or confidential documents read by anyone without your
ViaCrypt PGP is the perfect tool for individuals, small businesses,
large corporations, or anyone who values the privacy of their
proprietary or sensitive information. A software program that combines powerful cryptography with
ease-of-use, ViaCrypt PGP provides the ability to encrypt files and
messages.  Using Digital Signatures, it also provides a facility
for message authentication.
               You Control The Keys To Your Privacy
               ------------------------------------
With ViaCrypt PGP, you are in complete control of your privacy. YOU
create your keys.  YOU decide how long they are valid. YOU decide
who to trust. Other systems require you to place your trust in a disinterested
third party, or worse yet, a chain of faceless people you've never
met.  ViaCrypt PGP allows you to do so too, but never requires it. YOU are always in control.
ViaCrypt PGP is for people who don't want to surrender control of
their privacy.
                         Strong Cryptography
                         -------------------
ViaCrypt PGP combines the respected RSA system for Public Key
Cryptography with state-of-the-art IDEA(TM) encryption to protect
your files and electronic mail, and to let you communicate securely
with people you have never met.                              Features
                              --------
    * Protects the privacy of your files and e-mail messages.
    * Digitally signs files and e-mail messages to protect them
      from tampering and to authenticate the sender.
    * Sophisticated key management
    * RSA/IDEA hybrid encryption scheme
    * Message digests for digital signatures
    * Data compression before encryption
    * Simple, command-line interface for ease of use
    * Easy-to-understand documentation
                            How It Works
                            ------------
ViaCrypt PGP combines the best features of conventional and public
key cryptography.  Using conventional secret key cryptography, a
file can be encrypted using a key, then sent to the recipient. The
recipient decrypts the file using the same key. Conventional
cryptography is very fast, but it is difficult to provide the
recipient with the key in a secure manner.
Public key cryptography eliminates the problems associated with
distributing keys. Using public key cryptography, the key is split
into two halves: A private key that you never reveal, and a public
key that you can freely distribute. The public key and private key
are mathematically related such that anything encrypted using the
public key can be decrypted only using the matching private key.
In a process invisible to the user, ViaCrypt PGP creates a
temporary one-time key, called a session key, to encrypt the file
using fast conventional cryptography. Then the recipient's public
key is used to encrypt the session key. The encrypted session key
is sent along with the encrypted file to the recipient.  Once the
file is encrypted, only the intended recipient(s) can read it.
Using a single ViaCrypt PGP command, the recipient uses her own
private key to recover the session key, then uses that key to
quickly decrypt the file.
Message authentication is also provided. The sender's own private
key can be used to encrypt a 'fingerprint' or message digest of the
file or message. This creates a digital signature of the file or
message, which the recipient can check by using the sender's public
key to decrypt and compare with the original. The digital signatureproves that the sender was the true originator, and the file or
message has not been altered by anyone else.
                      ViaCrypt PGP Enables You To:
                      ----------------------------

@_subject: I hate to blast the whole list with this, but.... 
When requesting to be added to an Internet mailing list, *ALWAYS* try
to send mail to listname-request at host to reach the administrators.
We've gotten three messages to cypherpunks-east at mit.edu today asking
to be added.  Don't send mail to the list!  If you want to be added,
we'll be happy to do it if you send mail to
cypherpunks-east-request at mit.edu.  If you ever decide you no longer
want to be on cypherpunks, send mail to cypherpunks-request at toad.com.
And so forth.  I'm on large lists which get several requests sent
directly to the list every day by people who don't know any better.
This is annoying
All future list maintenance requests sent directly to cypherpunks-east
will be met with scorn and derision, and quite possibly ignored.
Thank you for your assistance.
