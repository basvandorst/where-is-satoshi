@_subject: Indian Cats - was: "Read this..." 
You stated:
I am shocked and amazed! At first I thought Bush had named his cat for "India Crude" which is a kind of oil, since he was in the oil business. I see now how wrong I was!
You are right of course, about the superiority of India.  I recognize India's greatness in the cause of world water conservation as well, particularly the sacrifices Indians have made in the area of personal hygiene by showering only once every 15 days- all for the cause of world thirst! As such I am moved- near tears- to support your efforts.
As a statement of dedication to your cause I have decided to rename my own cat, who I used to call "dothead" to "Jitendra" in your honor. Since that's pretty hard to say every time I want the cat to stop pissing on something I'm going to call him "Jizz" for short!
Thanks for helping to keep this kind of country bashing under control!
Hey, by the way, did you know that the British call bathrooms "the loo" ? I think Lulu's of the world need to unite and stop this kind of intentional slander! I know you Indians, who can't stand the colonialist scum who tried to build some kind of modern infrastructure in your country at their own expense and spoiled the natural state of the population in the process, will want to do anything you can to stick it to the Brits.  How can we let this stand?
I know I can count on your support by sending protest letters to the British Embassy!
