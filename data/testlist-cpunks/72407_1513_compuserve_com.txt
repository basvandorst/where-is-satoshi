@_subject: DARE T-shirts 
A friend of mine is in the T-shirt business...  he can take a GIF or other graphics file, print it on a color
printer, and heat-transfer it to a T-shirt.  Not quite as nice as silk-screen, but the set-up cost is much lower, especially for onesies.
Consider taking a paint program and, um, "rolling your
own" custom T-shirt design.  Perhaps run an official DARE poster through a color scanner and make suitable modifications.  If you're interested, I will ask him for details.
