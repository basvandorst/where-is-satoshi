I think this is a great idea. First time I'll play with making a POP client (an idea that appeals to me once in a while) I'll think about it...

Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt. Alleged technique of large companies to make
people think twice before buying products from lesser companies by casting
doubt over the reliability of the product and its creator. Thinking twice is
known to be a Bad Thing.

Sorry for the off-topic, but does anybody know of a list related to
militias, gun-control and the like?

@_subject: CDR: Think cash 
An interesting idea has surfaced on the freenet-chat list: is it possible to
build a program that creates some sort of a puzzle, whose answer the
generating computer knows (and can verify), but which can only be answered
by a human being, not by a computer? [Additional requirement: it should be
easy for the human to answer the puzzle.]
My proposal was to randomly create an image, which should be 1) easily
recognizable by a human (say the image of a pet), but 2) complex enough so
that no known algorithm could "reverse-engineer" this. [You need a
randomly-generated image because otherwise one could build a large database
of all the possible images and the correct answers.] Background information
would also be very useful - see
 - it's easy for
a human being to identify the animal in the picture, but (AFAIK) impossible
to write a program to do the same thing.

I wrote the RC4 algorithm in VBScript, and I think I even tried it in Perl
(but it wasn't so important that I'd actually try to get something working -
I still don't know much about Perl). Look for "cyphersaber" on the web for a
description of RC4 - it shouldn't take you more than an hour.
