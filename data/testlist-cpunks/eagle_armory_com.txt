@_subject: Key Length Correlation 
I've read Blaze and diffie's paper on Semetric Key Length.  I'm currious
how semetric key length correlates to public key cryptography length.  Does
public key length have to be much longer, (assuming the algorithms are strong),
to provide the same level of security as a shorter semetric key?  TIA

I assume then that the Netscape encryption is Symetric Key, so how do
RC4 RC2 and MD5 compare and contast? TIA

@_subject: Denning's misleading statements 
Having met Dr. Denning, and watched her presentation of the Escrowed
Encryption Standard, (for the novice), I can concur with your analysis.
She presented  a very limited, safe, simple clipper chip, which  would do
nothing more than give the FBI an analogous wire tap to gather information on terrorists, pedophiles, and organized criminals such as drug dealers.
The limitations of her argument were quickly ripped to shreds by Phil
Zimmerman, who painted a much more expansive world view canvas for the
audience.  Denning was visibly shaking as we talked after the session.
The NSA group think she was armed with didn't provide her the tools to
deal with the reality she found herself in.
Your participation in the A&E Voyager segment presented much food for thought.
We are becoming the "Bad Guys" in a well orchestrated Psy Ops campaign
propagated naively by the 4th Estate.  Robust cryptography and online
anonymity are portrayed as the tools of various "Boogie Men" the US Gov't
is obliged to protect  its unsuspecting civilians from.
Its up to us to find them specifically lying and cheating, and expose that
information to public scrutiny.  30 years ago the 4th Estate had a field
day hyping the LSD Chromosome Break *Hoax*.  Van Sim, of the Edgewood Arsenal
was unable to replicate the research, but his findings were suppressed by the
US Army by virtue of a long standing liaison between the CIA and the research and development staff at Edgewood.
Denning announced the  Clipper scheme secure, and Blaze hacked it shortly
there after.  She parrots the NSA party line, and there is a well established
link of conflict of interest negating any academic objectivity she might
profess.  Those of you who've come in personal contact with NSA cryptographers
can attest to their collective arrogance.  They consider themselves an
exclusive elite, above trivial civil liberties issues.

Tim sez... Bass is fun to drink with too.  His web site is under attack and he needs a
hacker if anyone is interested in doing any pro bono community service work.
Bruce's comments on the robustness of foreign, (i.e. unescrowed) encryption
were very enlightening as well.  It was good to see all the old CDT hands, and
the munchies Gilmore bought went quickly at the Godwin table.  Mike makes a
substantial argument that the Supreme Court will not overturn ACLU et. al. v.
Reno, but I wouldn't pretend to speak for him.  And Cindy Cohn is the point man in the Super Bowl long range recon team, Bernstein v. DoS.
Defending Bernstein on First Amendment grounds and having judge Patel rule that
for the purposes of the case, source code is speech, is a big deal.  The First
Amendment survives the Electronic Revolution with ACLU v. Reno.  The Super
Bowl is ITAR.  It's nice to have some momentum going in to the Super Bowl.
With robust, uncompromised cryptography, we can reclaim the 4th Amendment
ourselves.  I have a feeling that the congressional support is reaching
critical mass.
Oh yeah, knowing me as you do Tim, it probably doesn't surprise you that the
entire global positioning system is going to roll over at midnight 23 August
1999, and claim it's my 25th birthday, 6 January 1980...

Vladimir rebuts May quoting Bass...
That's because you don't understand American Football.  The NSA is Jerry
Kramer for the FBI's Frank Gifford on a double whammy end around of any
substantial public hearings on the subject running a play Lombardi designed
in the height of the Cold War.  The only problem is Lombardi died of cancer,
and the Clinton Administration has been duped into winning one for the Gipper-
except the Gip has altzheimers and Nancy has to wipe his chin, so its bed time
for Bonzo, ITAR and EES!  Party on C'punks! Internet is the revenge of the
nerds on Acid.  (Don't post when you're peaking...don't post when you're peaking...)

A certain New York Times columnist questions Markoff's ethics, and I believe
John that the toad.com logs showed no intrusion by Mitnick.  I managed to
peg a precise time on Kevin's multi-system intrusion on my home Sparc 20,
which helped peg him in NC off the 1(800) ANI he was gaining access through.
One of Mitnick's friends had the audacity to contact Stanton at EFF about
the possibility of defending him.  He was told there were no classical
civil liberties to argue in the case...  So I suppose it's best to let
sleeping dogs lie, eh?

You guys wouldn't believe what a mogolian clusterfuck Worldnet is.  When is
the physical C'punks meeting at SGI?  I'll be in the bay in a few hours and
around the EFF office and the SAFE conference at Stanford Monday.  Worldnet
software is invasive as hell.  Installations on boxes running Win95 with a PCI bus, plug and play BIOS and the I/O on the motherboard have IRQ's and
interupts overwritten to the point the box locks and won't even boot anymore.
Speaking of SGI, TCI, (John Malone), just bought $25,000,000.00 worth of
their boxes...

That's so the Federal Reserve doesn't become crippled in the world monetary
market, just because the NSA doesn't want to lose its wire-tap ability.

There is *some* justice in America.  The University of Wyoming had a Campus
Cop named Waters, who also worked for Information Technology and fancied
himself becoming the next Internet Sherlock Holms.  Unfortunately, IT canned
his ass for alleged violations of privacy before he could make a career out
of electronic snooping.  The closest he came to me in all the years I was using unauthorized access there, was giving me a ticket for driving on an
expired license.
Now days I'm getting too legit to quit.  Prof Van Baalen bought my idea of
Free Public Internet Access for Wyoming residents on a self educational UNIX
box, a spare Sparc 10 wired at T1 speed.  We go online by the Equinox >;)

Anyone in the front range interested in a physical meeting?  Majordomo's

I heard through  the family grapevine that they have pictures of a Stinger
taking out the plane they're analyzing in the Pentagon.  There are 220+
Stingers *missing* in the US, so its not like they have to smuggle them
in...  (That's not proof by any means, but *my* family grapevine has always
been very reliable.  The cousin who told me this has a Dad who flew as
the intelligence officer observer on Bronco flights out of Quang Tri for
18 months, rotating out just before the base was over run in May of '72.)
