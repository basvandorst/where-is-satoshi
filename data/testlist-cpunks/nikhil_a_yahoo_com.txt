@_subject: regarding e mail database. 
Dear Sir/madam,
    I have 2 E-mail databases which I want to sell.
    The first database consists of 1,20,000 E-mail addresses. In this database I only have the E- mail addresses and no other information of the person to whom it belongs to, not even the name.     The second database consists of 2000 E-mail addresses along with a lot of details like name, age, sex, hobbies, address, phone No.,etc.
If you are interested in the database please mail me back.
Thanking you, and expecting a reply from you on a positive note.
yours truly.
Nikhil Agrawal
