Do you know the Redbook specs?  From my understanding of the specs to have
a C2 rateing you can't have a NIC card or Disk Drive.  But I think you can
have a NIC card in the machine connected to a network that is enrycpted
network.  But I could be wrong but I don't forget most of what I read.. MS is haveing problems meeting the standards and they have alot of work
to do on NT when it comes to Secuirty.  Any was see MSN.com today?

Well the way I see it the author of ICKill told the company that puts out
ICQ that you have this problem and you need to fix it..  The way he's
looking at it is fix this because it's a problem.  They did not fix it
after his requests to have them fix this so he shared it.  I don't think
he did anything wrong in this case.  Any way like the FBI could figure out
how to use it I don't give them that much credit as it is.  )ark |(night
