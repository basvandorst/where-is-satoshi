@_subject: CRYPTO '93  -  Conference Announcement & Final Call for Papers 
I recommend this conference.  It's cheap to attend, you'll meet almost all
the world-class cryptographers there are (out in the open, as well as some
of the spooks), the food is great, and the campus is a fun place to visit.
Everything is in walking distance, and the ocean and cliffs are right there.
As well as a lot of interesting people and discussions.
I wouldn't submit a paper unless it was a serious academic paper, but
you could submit a "rump session" talk about some of the cypherpunk
activities you've been doing.  You'll get five or ten minutes to
explain and handle questions, with overhead slides.  The presentations
have ranged from how to break DES (Adi Shamir & Eli Biham) to ideas
about building MSDOS viruses that would infect millions of PC's to do
brute force crypto cracking (Steve White of IBM, I think).  I've
spoken at two of the last three rump sessions about one or another
social or political aspect of cryptography.  Whit Diffie chairs the
rump session, which is held after dinner with beer and wine, and you
can send him proposals for your talk by email (diffie at eng.sun.com).
        CRYPTO '93  -  Conference Announcement & Final Call for Papers
The Thirteenth Annual CRYPTO Conference, sponsored by the International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR), in cooperation with the IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Security and Privacy, the Computer Science Department of the University of California, Santa Barbara, and Bell-Northern Research (a subsidiary of Northern Telecom), will be held on the campus of the University of California, Santa Barbara, on August 22-26, 1993. Original research papers and technical expository talks are solicited on all practical and theoretical aspects of cryptology. It is anticipated that some talks may also be presented by special invitation of the Program Committee.
