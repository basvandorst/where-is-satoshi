If getting around GSM encryption is no problem, then why are governments
pushing the issue?

@_subject: problem installing pgp on a sun4... 
I downloaded 'pgp' from soda.berkeley.edu and 'unproto' from
win.tue.nl, ran the Makefile (make sun4cc) and got a binary that passes
the test given in setup.doc.
However, I got the following warnings:
"crypto.c", line 1445: warning: constant 256 is out of range of
unsigned char comparison "crypto.c", line 1445: warning: result of comparison is always true
(along with the same messages for line 2445.)
Here are the relevant lines...  from pgp.h:
from crypto.c:
1445 -->                if (litfile[0] < MAX_PATH) 2445 -->                if (litfile[0] < MAX_PATH)
I can see where this is a problem; 256 won't fit into eight bits.  What
is the correct way to fix this.  Should MAX_PATH be set to something else?
Thanks for your help,
Eric Fogleman

@_subject: Q: What's happening in cryptography? 
I'm interested in finding out what is currently happening in
cryptography.  My (basement-level) knowledge of it has come from heavy
mathematics-oriented texts; these books and articles make it seem as
though all of the work in cryptography is done by Ph.Ds at
universities.  I suspect that's not the whole story...
- What companies, universities are doing work in cryptography?  Are
there people who get paid to "do cryptography" that don't work for the
NSA?  If so, where do they work?
- Does cryptography fall under mathematics or computer science at most
- Are the real developments in cryptographic algorithms coming from the
universities, from companies or from cypherpunks?
- Any suggestions on what to read, who to talk to, what to experiment
with to move up from basement-level knowledge of cryptography?

@_subject: Communications Policy 
Responding to the following from Norm Hardy:
Institutions -- individuals, groups of individuals, companies -- should
have the right to private communication.  (In terms of e-mail, this
means that one knows where all copies of their letters are and has the
power to erase them?)
The right of government employees to private communication is limited
by one important factor:  many of these individuals are empowered to
use force against citizens, and they responsibile for justifying the
use of this force.  (Examples of what I mean by force:  arresting and
putting people in jail, searching, seizing, impounding, levying taxes,
wiretapping, shooting alleged criminals).  Anyone given this kind of
power has a heavy burden of proof and had better be able to prove
beyond a shadow of doubt that their actions are justified.
The burden should not be on individuals to constantly be open to
scrutiny to demonstrate their innocence, but on those with the
power to suspend individual rights.

@_subject: privacy vs. public servants 
Responding to Tom DeBoni's message concerning whether or not
government officials should have a right to secure communications.
I agree with Dave Deltorto's idea about "a body that decided on a case
by case (or a class by class) basis what accounts would be subject to
heavy scrutiny".  Or perhaps limiting certain public servants (the
chief executive, Oliver North's successor, etc) to a set of "open" computing systems and communication paths.  (Similar to limiting
people with security clearances to sets of closed computing systems, communication paths.)
Dave says:
Unwieldy?  Kafka-esque?  Expensive?  Possibly, but it doesn't have to
be that way.  As Bongo says:  "The price of freedom is eternal
vigilance."  How much do you want to pay?

@_subject: Limiting "white" noise runlength 
Mr. Thug,
In talking about "white" noise, you mentioned:
Why not feed back the previously encrypted bits to perform the
"present" encryption (something like cipher block chaining) to keep
this from happening?  Then any particular encrypted character will
depend on *all* previous characters and break up runs of "plaintext".
That seems much better than un-whitening your white noise...

Jordan Hayes responds to Rusty Babani:
I have to agree with Jordan on this.  In a truly free society, you have
the right to use your property as you see fit.  And so does the university.
Your right to free speech doesn't mean you have the right to someone

@_subject: Questions about PGP 2.2 compilation messages 
I recently compiled _pgp2.1_ on my sun4 and had a similar problem...  I
got a binary that seemed to work, but I got a list of warnings.
In my case, the program actually had a bug in it; it was trying to
compare an unsigned character variable (8 bits) for maximum path length
to 256 (nine bits) as defined in the source code.  I asked around on
the list and I got the same sort of responses you did...
I ended up redefining and changing the compare statement to make the
compiler happy and still get the intended code...
So, pgp may not be entirely bug free...  The sun4 compiler may be more
conscientious about flagging things.  I'd suggest looking through the
source to see if there's something simple.  In my case, it was.
Let me know how you fare; I'll be going through the same thing shortly...

Insert pgp-encrypted (not plaintext) into the sound file...  It's then
no weaker that pgp.
Use a "windows sound system" board and record yourself talking --
No "reference source"... The codec on that board has better than two bits of noise per 16 bit word through the ADC channel...
Nice idea, thug!
