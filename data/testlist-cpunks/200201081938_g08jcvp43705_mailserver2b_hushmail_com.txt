@_subject: End of the IRS?? 
argument is supposed to play out.
business going on, that would be one thing. the federal government to seize power not granted by the Constitution
(and, in some cases, strictly prohibited by it). Booze prohibition
required a constitutional amendment; drug prohibition wouldn't.
All the more reason to go on a mindless killing spree.
what would stop the courts from saying -- it wasn't necessary?
No but it would provide whatever moral basis one needs to terminate the vermin with extreme prejudice.  What's needed are a few terminally ill militia minded souls to give up their last few weeks for the cause.  I know I wouldn't hesitate.  Maybe an anon cash pool, collected after the fact, to support these patriots' families could be used to offer additional incentive.
