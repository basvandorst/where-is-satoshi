This is usually accomplished through an external "data encryption unit",
which is interfaced between the terminal (host) and modem. It is NOT in
Aside from those very expensive high-end boxes that banks use for
their sensative information, there was a DES encryptor made by Practical
Peripherals years ago.  It still may be available.

Don't think so.  Unless you have fiber running from your location (your home)
to the calling party's location.
The tap is placed on the subscriber loop - which for the time being is analog
for most voice service.  And even if it is digital, it is still copper from
the CO.
If you are concerned with eavesdropping, then your statement is accurate.
It is very easy to eavesdrop on microwave and satellite long distance.
I suspect the Clipper chip will be used heavily in digital cellular phones,
if it isn't too much of a power hog.

@_subject: cryptanalysis for radio communications 
sameer at uclink.berkeley.edu says...
Actually, Morotola makes some nice DES encryption systems for radio
communications.  Listening to these on a normal scanner, you will hear the
squelch open and a burst of white-noise like sound.  This is the DES
encryption that the feds use.
There are simple frequency inversion systems that are in use by some
agencies, mostly local if any, but there are $25 kits to decode this.
To break the Motorola system, it would not be an easy undertaking.  You
would have to demodulate the digital data stream, figure out the word
sync, and then start analysing.  That assumes that there is no compression
going on!
Maybe you could modify some of the circuits out ther for decoding the cellular
control channel data stream, although that is much slower than this.

@_subject: Police RF Links 
Jim choate says...
I think you will find that most modems will NOT demodulate this data, only
the simplest RF data links use modulation schemes compatible with standard
modems.  (For example, the RF Packet Data systems that are merely grown up
versions of the equipment sold to amateur radio operators that does use
modems that comply to CCITT or old Bell standards).
But most police departments that are using mobile data terminals are using
proprietary modulation schemes.  So you would have to determine what type of
systems are in use in the target area, and then obtain a compatible unit
with a spoofed unit identification.
Not that easy.  A lot harder than just monitoring these transmissions.
Check out a publication called "The SPEC-COM Journal", available at
Ham Radio stores near you, this is the definitive guide to different and
experimental modulation schemes that Hams are playing with.

@_subject: To Digest or Not To Digest 
I think the optimum solution is to provide it both ways, in
digest form as well as the way it is now.  Digesting it would
also help provide a standard way to archive the list.  We really
need archives of this available, "official" archives that we know
contain all the messages.  While many readers are keeping archives,
they aren't standardized.

@_subject: TEMPEST, Van Eyck Radiation, and Eavesdropping 
As FCC regulations become tighter, the issue of Van Eyck Radiation
will go down some.  In 1974, when we had a Motorola Exorbus 6800
development system; the neighbors could tell what we were doing on it
by the RFI to their TV sets.  My 1993 Quadra doesn't even totally
wipe out a receiver sitting next to it.
More reason to use a LCD panel or EL display.  None of this messy
sync radiation.
If you can still receive the AM broadcast band inside your conductive
wallpapered room, I would not feel comfortable about attenuation
being provided. ;->

@_subject: spooks on cypherpunks 
You know, spooks need strong Crypto, too.  I think you're making the
assumption that the only reason a spook is here is to infiltrate us and do
us harm.  I bet it is quite the opposite.
What is the best way to stay hidden and secure?  Use strong crypto that can
be found almost anywhere (like PGP). Strong crypto that doesn't scream
goverment or worse.  Blend in with the rest fo the crypto traffic.
Spooks get *caught* by doing things that are out of the ordinary.  Spooks
stay in business by not standing out and disappearing in the crowds.
It probably sounds silly, but there are probably more or at least as many
spooks who *like* what we're doing than those who oppose it.

@_subject: Random #'s via Sound Cards 
Great idea.  Hell, you don't even really need random gibbirish; most sound
cards have such poor analog audio front ends, you could just turn up the
gain and look at the LSBs.  I've mostly used the mid-level Mac products
from Digidesign, and even they have analog noise that is easily detectable
in the lower bits.
And for MacPGP- most Macs now have a sound-in; you could either do the
noise trick again (won't work as well in 8-bit, probably), or just base it
on the backgroud sounds.

@_subject: STEG: Obtaining digital audio accuratly 
perobich at ingr.com sez:
SGI uses modified firmware on their DAT/DDS units to read audio
daata, but I am pretty sure the Toshiba mech is stock.  Why?
I have a program called direct to disk from OMI that lets me load
audio data from an Apple CD-SC300 or the Toshiba mech, outputting
AIFF, Sound Designer II and several other file formats.  The AIFF and
SDII formats are stereo 16-bit 44.1kHz; usually the QuickTime formats
are 8 bit.  So the AIFF and SDII formats have the full bit stream.

nobody at soda.berkeley.edu says...
1. Why was the secret service looing for stolen property?
2. This is an urban legend.  There is no "signature" on the output of    Canon CLC copiers.
because these copiers are so maintenance-intensive, and since Canon *owns* most of the CLC dealers, it would be very easy for them to check their s/n records when they are servicing the equipment (which needs to be done when the devices are moved)!
pretty exciting, huh?

250 The Hams have implemented TCP/IP over the air, using the airwaves as a sort
of ethernet (albiet slowly).  Works quite well.  However, these addresses
are not internet addresses, and the Ham network has very important
FCC-mandated restrictions on message content.  (No encrypting, no
commercial traffic, no explicit or oobscene stuff).  Don't confuse this
with the UUCP city.state.us domains.
If you see a user or site name such as [KN]*[1-9]*  (e.g. N7SZS or K7BUC),
recognize that as a ham call sign and assume that it is a tcp/ip packet
