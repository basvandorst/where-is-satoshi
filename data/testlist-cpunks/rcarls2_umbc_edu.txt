@_subject: Sunday discussion on privacy and civil rights is at 1pm 
The Sunday discussion group on preserving privacy and civil rights in
the time period following the World Trade Center tragedy will begin at
Same as yesterday, we will meet in the Lobby of the Albin O. Kuhn
Library on University of Maryland Baltimore County campus in Baltimore,
MD.  More information and directions are available at  or
by calling 443-540-1957.
Yesterday's meeting was amazingly educational and helped narrow the
focus of what political action needs to be taken quickly and in the
short term.  The focus of this meeting will be a letter-writing
campaign, so bring your notebooks (paper and electronic) and wireless
cards if you have them.  The AOK Library is 802.11b wireless enabled.
  Notes from the previous meeting will (hopefully) be available shortly
prior to the start of this one.
Hope to see you here.
