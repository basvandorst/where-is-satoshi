You're just trolling, right?
"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or

assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."
Sending a reporter to jail for not revealing her source sure sounds like
its infringing on freedom of the press to me.  The issue isn't HER.  The
issue is that if I'm someone that wants to blow the whistle on
something, I'm going to be less likely to do it if the reporter I tell
might reveal me as her source.  And of course, reporters might be less
likely to cover such stories if they may end up choosing between
protecting the source and jail.
"On July of 2005, Miller was jailed for contempt of court by refusing to
testify before a federal grand jury investigating a leak naming Valerie
Plame as a covert CIA agent. Miller did not write about Plame, but is
reportedly in possession of evidence relevant to the leak investigation.
According to a subpoena, Miller met with an unnamed government official
? later revealed to be "Scooter" Libby, Vice President Cheney's Chief of
Staff ? on July 8, 2003, two days after former ambassador Joseph Wilson
published an Op-Ed in the Times criticizing the Bush administration for
"twisting" intelligence to justify war in Iraq. (Plame's CIA identity
was revealed by political commentator Robert Novak on July 14, 2003.)"
That woman went to jail for not revealing the source, on a story SHE
NEVER EVEN WROTE.  Thats dedication.

My understanding is that she only went to jail because of a federal law
passed in the early 80's designed to protect undercover federal agents.
Maybe I'm misunderstanding, but I was under the impression that were it
not for that law, there would be no need for a "shield law"...just
stronger clarification of that law.  Did this issue go before the
supreme court...have they ruled that the law is constitutional?
Freedom of the press should protect a reporter from prosecution fromt he
reporting of ANYTHING.  Reporting about a felon is fine(i don't think
current laws dispute this).  If in addition to that, the reporter is
breaking ANOTHER law by shielding a felon, thats another issue altogether.
We're talking freedom to report things, not freedom for a reporter to do
anything they wish.

I don't have a good feeling about this at all.  My passport is actually
invalid as a form of ID for anyone who checks closely(the BMV did!)
because the gov't printed the wrong birthdate on mine!
I went to Germany and back just after the embassy attacks in
africa(things were on high alert briefly then) with no questions on it.
 Try to renew my lost drivers license with it and suddenly its a damn
As far as I can tell, they used the month of issue as the birth month as
well.  A small mistake...but obviously an important one.  What ways do
you suppose there will be for them to screw up these RFID tags?  These
days ones libel to get branded a terrorist with the wrong info...
