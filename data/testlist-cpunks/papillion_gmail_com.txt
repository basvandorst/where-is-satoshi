@_subject: Gnu PG is more Safe ? 
Welcome to the list! It's good to see so many new members coming on  board. I'm new myself.
Because GnuPG is open source, it's been extensively peer reviewed and  found safe and secure.  That doesn't mean it's perfect and has no  errors. But they are much less likely to exist in GnuPG than in some  other solutions; particularly proprietary ones.
One of the best ways to learn about tech topics is reading RFC's. The  entire way SSL/TLS operates is detailed in an RFC. Read I'd and you  will be infinately more informed.
Unfortunately, I can't really recommend any good crypto list because  I've not found many. To learn about FnuPG and practice, you might want  to look at the PGPNET list. Another of interest might be Cryptography.
Regards and Welcome!

Sure, bugs will be overlooked or  outright missed in any project of size. But with more eyes comes a  better chance of bugs and backdiors being caught.
It depends on the RFC and how it's written. I've read many RFC's that  were very informative and easy to understand. A well written book on  the topic is always better, but you can almost always find what you  need in the RFC. It may not be optimal but it's not horrible.
