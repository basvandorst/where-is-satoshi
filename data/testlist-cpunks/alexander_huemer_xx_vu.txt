this may be a weird request, but it is meant seriously.
I am searching for the movie 'Cryptic Seduction', which _somehow_ has a
similar background as this ML.
Since I don't know where to ask otherwise, I am asking here.
If anybody has a hint for me, thanks in advance.
Kind regards,

People have mounted the magnetron of a microwave oven on a satellite dish in order to achieve something like this. Maybe that's what is referenced here.
Kind regards,
