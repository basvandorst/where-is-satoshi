You the problem in the cross hairs.  But what's to be done when your elected representative and fellow citizens are either too scared or don't care to discuss a plain reading of the constitution?  These ugly measures may cause some of us to assume that maybe the American revolution isn't over and that the ghost of George III and his Tories now reside in D.C.  Thank God so many of us own firearms and are therefore citizens and not merely subjects.
