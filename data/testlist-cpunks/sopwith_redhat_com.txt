@_subject: Securing Internet mail at the MTA level 
I think something like the first one would be a little bit better. In my
mind I see something similar to the "ESMTP" message appearing on
connection to the mail daemon - "SSLESMTP" if you will. Then client could
issue a "ENCD SSL" command (or whatever) and it would go crypto. I already
have used telnet and FTP clients that does something similar to this, and
they work almost transparently....
Have you looked at SSL? It allows different algorithms to be used, etc.
etc. (although the certificate & key distribution method uses x509, which
may be a pain...?). The SSLeay library is a freely available
implementation of SSLv2.
Just MHO,

Linux, however, does have the cfs (crypted filesystem), which will let you
do the same thing. Supposedly lets you plug in your own encryption method
and all that... Also allows different users to encrypt with different
passwords, and such (or just the root user encrypt the whole partition).
Find the web page for more info.

This guy's gotta get stopped somehow. Is there an Anti-SPAM list that
would be more appropriate for this?

Wrong. What kills is not voltage but current. That is why you can safely
recieve a static shock (on the order of thousands of volts, but
microamperes) and yet still be killed by ordinary AC power (110 volts
here, a whole lot of amps available :).

Cutting off the power supply would render this method useless very
quickly. Oh, so you are going to use batteries? That "when an intrusion is
detected" part sounds rather interesting... Wouldn't be too hard to either
The point is:
IOW, if a 'pre-dawn unannounced ninja raid' [sic] occurs on you, you are
pretty well beat, if only because the other side knows what they are doing
and you have no idea of their plans.
The only protection against lawlessness is not lawlessness, it is reason.
