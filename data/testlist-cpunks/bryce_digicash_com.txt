@_subject: arbiter/escrow agent for hire 
I hereby offer to be arbiter and escrow agent for cypherpunks bet settlements.  My conditions:
1.  I won't deal in old-fashioned currencies.  Mark Twain
U.S. Dollar ecash or Merita Bank of Finland Finnish Mark
ecash or First Digital Bank cyberbuck ecash only, please.
2.  I don't handle bets larger than USD300.00, or FIM1500.00, or cyb300,000.00.  These are just my arbitrary comfort limits.  (It's also large enough to cover the kinds of things that go on here, IMESHO.)
3.  My fee per bet is USD5.00 or FIM50.00, or cyb7000.00.  This is for "simple", winner-take-all bets.  For other
arrangements, make me an offer.
4.  I have to have an explicit description of how the bet
will be settled which is acceptable to me.  This will be
known as the "bet description".
 a.  It has a dearth of loopholes and ambiguities, both with
       regard to the subject of contention and with regard
       to the settling procedure, including settling agents
       and settling schedule.
 b.  It doesn't require me to be the "settling agent" who
       does the research or performs the experiment or
       whatever.
Before I am committed to the job I will require 3 items to
be submitted to me:
1. Acceptable digital signature upon the "bet statement" from each bettor.  (Note that PGP signatures from PGP key
pairs which are not connected to me via the Web of Trust, or
which are not verifiable by me via an out-of-band
connection, are not acceptable digital signatures.  This is
because of the MITM attack problem, not because  I need True
Names to be connected to the signatures.)
2. My fee.  (I don't care who pays it--  One or both bettors
or spectators.)
3. Amount of the bet from each bettor.  This chunk of money
will be known as the "ante".  Note that depending upon the
details of the "bet statement", each bettor may submit a
different ante.  (Yes, up front.  Yes, I get antes from both
bettors.  Yes, I keep them while the bet is being settled.  Why do you think my fee is so low?)
Final Notes:
1.  I reserve the right to reject any bet for any reason.  Although my fee is non-refundable, the antes are refundable
in this case.  If I exercise this right after the antes have been delivered, I will return them to their respective
2.  The bettors may _not_ unilaterally or unconditionally reserve the right to cancel the bet after having signed the
bet statement and submitted their antes.  Provisions for cancelling the bet after that point, if desired, should be written into the bet statement.
3.  I don't do currency exchange.  If your betting partner
submits his ante in Finnish Marks and you win then you are
getting Finnish Marks.  If you submit an ante in cyberbucks
and then I cancel the bet, you are getting cyberbucks
refunded to you.
Please contact me via e-mail (PGP preferred) if you wish to engage my services.

Hm.  This is a toughie.  For one it would help if Black
Unicorn had a "pseudonym keysignature" from someone who had
a Web O Trust link to me.  This would make me more certain
that a hypothetical man in the middle between me and the
rest of you wasn't able to impersonate Black Unicorn.  Of
course, such a MITM could still impersonate Black Unicorn by
being between Uni and the rest of us.  It would help if Uni
made a habit of publishing his true public key via various
difficult-to-intercept channels, but of course we can't
_know_ whether Uni is doing that or not in any case.
Yeah, it's hard to gain trust in the absence of a Mitch (a.k.a.
MITM) between Uni and us.  It is feasible, for my purposes,
though.  We could tie Uni's ostensible pubkey to the Web of
Trust.  We could assume that Uni is resourceful enough to
publish his own pubkey via difficult-to-intercept channels,
to check his own pubkey, and to broadcast a warning if any
active attack is detected.  Then as time passed we could
gain trust in the lack of an active attack on that pubkey.
Currently neither the first (add key to WoT) nor the second
(believe that Uni is actively trying to propagate/check his
key) step is working...

@_subject: connecting Uni to the Web O Trust 
Ya gotta get yourself connected, as the Stereo MC's said.
Unfortunately I can't see anyway to gain trust in this
pseudonym since I don't believe that the ostensible owner,
name of "Black Unicorn", understands about how to establish
a strong pseudonym in the Web O Trust.
I mean, I could explain it to him, but not even counting the
difficulties of communicating such complex concepts among
humans, there is the fact that if Mitch is here, he can
prevent the real Uni from seeing the explanation, and he can
act in Black Uni's place as if he understands.  Then he can
go through the necessary steps to increase our trust in his
pubkey, as if Uni were going through them.
There would be only one problem for Mitch:  there would be
some knowledge shared by the facade Uni and the rest of us
that was not shared by the real Uni and the rest of us.
Forever into the future whenever this knowledge came up in
conversation Mitch would have to break automated-active-attack
mode and go into acting mode to prevent us from realizing
that we remembered history differently.
Wouldn't be cool if we could somehow make much of our
conversation depend on that shared memory in some
non-automatible way?  Then we could just recurse, making
more and more of the conversation depend on previous
conversation in a non-automatible way.  Eventually all of
our conversation would have to be acted by a human MITM
instead of just falsely digitally authenticated by an
automated MITM...

@_subject: Bold Assertion: there are no Men in the Middle 
I have the intuition that there has never been a successful
MITM attack which has subverted the use of PGP authentication.  If we could be sure of this hypothesis, then we could go about creating a strongly linked Web O Trust and then use it from now until such a future time as
1024-bit PGP keys are brute forceable.  We could also use it to bootstrap bigger keys, a wider and more strongly-
connected Web O Trust, etc.
I can't think of any good way to test this hypothesis,
however.  One thing that we _could_ test is the difficulty
of performing such an attack.
If I had the cash, I would post a reward for anyone who
could successfully run a demo MITM attack on two
unsuspecting stooges.  I would (of course) specify with more
precision what would constitute a successful attack, how it
would be proven to me that the attack was successful and so
But I don't have sufficient cash to motivate such a trick,
and there would be some very complicated ethical and
logistic questions about performing it.
I still have a strong intuition that I could keep my cash if
I made such a proposal and gave it a few simple stipulations
(such as that the attacker would have to forge important
material in the victim's name rather than just use the
attack to eavesdrop...).  The successful attacker would
have to have the ability to get in the middle of TCP/IP connections as well as perhaps telephone connections, as well as have formidable computational and "social-engineering" (really: "-cracking") resources.

@_subject: connecting Uni to the Web O Trust 
It is most certainly worth something, as long as the
participants exercise the necessary measures to detect and
correct any active attacks on it.  The primary reason that
the Web O Trust is ineffective at this point is the
prevalence of misunderstandings among users (including
cypherpunks) about its usage and its efficacy.
As an example of these prevalent misunderstandings, I submit
to you the fact that PGP keyservers do not use PGP, either
for encryption or authentication.  If you suggest it to them
(or indeed, to most cypherpunks) they will respond that it
would "do no good".  Ridiculous.
It's a shame really, since if we _did_ have the wits to
create a Web O Trust now, it would serve to prevent active
attacks in the future.
Hopefully the public key infrastructure people will come up
with something that will replace the WoT and will be more
understandable or acceptable to people.
In the meantime, I cannot have much confidence in the
security of my private communications with Black Unicorn,
which makes me hesitant to exchange money with him.

@_subject: search engine improvement 
Keywords: distributed ratings systems, search engines, spiders, spiderspace, idea futures, The Shockwave Rider, John Brunner
You know there is a trick that might greatly improve the effectiveness of a search engine at almost no cost to the end
user.  It is the well-known heuristic of "If Person A likes X
and Y, and Person B likes X, then Person B probably likes Y.",
combined with passive polling (which is getting information
about people's opinions just by watching their actions, instead
of by asking them).
A first simple implementation would keep a table of the pages
that people choose, keyed from the query that they originally
submitted.  Those pages that people choose most frequently from
the list of matching pages (and/or those pages that people
"stop" on-- that they do _not_ follow by further searching),
would get bumped up a little in the list.
This would be massively expensive in networking, storage, and
computation, giving those hi-tech Alpha clusters at AltaVista
something to do...  :^)
There are plenty of extras and refinements that could be added
(for example, put some keywords identifying your "affiliation"
in a separate field.  It will only consider the results from
other people who entered the same affiliation keywords when
weighting your search results.).  And there are some good topics
for further discussion, such as is it worthwhile to distinguish
between "relevancy" and "value"?
I don't have a comprehensive list of people who are already
working on this area (distributed ratings) (if I did, I might have Cc:'ed them), but I know that many people are.  I hope that
they and the search engine people get together and make cool
stuff soon.
There is the interesting issue of whether this will cause
self-reinforcing "degeneration", where people (or an
"affiliation"-keyed group of people) accidentally overlook a
worthy page early in the game, and then, using each other's
behavior to influence their own, reinforce that mistake.
As a final attribution note:  John Brunner thought of this idea
idea in his prophetic novel _The Shockwave Rider_ in the 75.  There is a wonderful line which I can't find right now, about how it turned out to be a flywheel instead of an oracle, merely aggregating human mistakes and successes.
P.S.  ObCryptoRelevance:  Um...  you could get paid for your
ratings using Chaumian ecash, and even have your ratings popped
into the right "affiliation" using Chaumian credentials...

point?  My point was (and is) that neither you nor I have any kind of
_right_ to access the services of toad.com against John's
will.  Seems like a very simple point (deceptively simple, one
might say...), but I recall several people, including Dale
Thorn, opining that Dmitri Vulis _did_ have the right to access
those services with or without John's consent.

Yes, this is fairly accurate.  Of course we (most of us) do not

Perhaps you are objecting to the idea that our access to John's
computer is equivalent to, say, our access to our own
computers?  I certainly agree with you that it is not the same
kind of access.
Yeah, there are some (relatively) subtle issues here like "when
is it merely extended causal relation and when is it usage", or "what are the details of this implicit agreement that we have

Yes this is a fine analogy.  You have the right to send

that any particular thing be _done_ with those letters once
they arrive, in the absence of some contract to the contrary.
Noooo...  What I was saying was that even such a simple service
as a mailing list raises some complex issues about agency and
responsibility.  Did _you_ send MMF to all those people, or did
Gilmore?  What if Gilmore had a MMF filter in place?  What if
you evaded it?  What if Gilmore only broadcasts signed messages
and you signed the MMF?  What if you paid to have it broadcast?
So what _I'm_ saying is that there are some complex issues
about this kind of cyberspatial event, but that the realspace
substrate is relatively simple-- it's Gilmore's computer and
you have no moral authority to demand that he do or not do any
particular thing with it.
In the following, you appear to take exception to both of these
claims, or at least to the first one-- I'm not sure.
I'm still not sure if you are just prone to colorful rhetoric,

simple premise--  they habitually do so with regard to "public"

I really don't see why programs like majordomo, UseNet

Okay, fine.  Having waited for FIVE YEARS or however long it has
been, you who are responsible for such handy dandy programs may
now convincingly argue that you might as well wait for another
few months to get PGPlib.  But I sincerely hope that once PGPlib
arrives we don't wait another five years before using it.
(There is another argument that people sometimes make-- that
it is too complicated to ensure pubkey<->True Name.  SO WHAT!  Pubkey<->True Name mapping is an advanced feature that depends
upon the existence of some kind of public key infrastructure.
Many people, myself included, wouldn't even USE pubkey<->True
Name mapping if we had it!  Just implement some basic
privacy/authentication functions (trivial, using PGP 2.6 under
Unix) and MitCH be damned!  If we had started with the simple
stuff five years ago we might HAVE a complete, secure

As an example of this sad state of affairs, no less of a
cryptographic enthusiast than Robert Hettinga runs a mailing
list (several actually) which breaks every PGP clear-signature
that it encounters.
Really pitiful, that even our own mailing lists are incompatible

I should be able to execute scripts remotely by sending e-mail

Perl is a natural choice of interpreter.  Has anybody

My moderation bot STUMP is not only PGP-aware, it is also doing
a lot of PGP-related things. Among them: 1) For posters who voluntarily chose additional protection, STUMP allows
only messages with a valid PGP signature to be posted. All posts from
these people that do not have a PGP sig or have an invalid sig, are
automatically rejected. It protects them from forgeries.
2) All exchange between my modbot and human moderators is PGP-signed
(and encrypted when necessary), to insure integrity of moderation
email traffic.
3) All message approved for posting to usenet get signed with Greg
Rose's PGPMoose program.
4) There is an additional service for those who post through anonymous
remailers BUT want to have an identity and reputation. The idea is that
they submit their PGP keys to the robomoderator, and later robomod
takes the user id from the PGP key, replacing meaningless anonymous
addresses with their identity.
We currently have at least two posters whose real life identities are
unknown, who use this feature and have sent us their PGP keys.

Of course a real rating would be signed by my ratings private key and not by my e-mail private key.  I might start a service
where I will pay you for your ratings and then distribute them
for a fee.  (Note that you get paid for generating ratings, as
long as your ratings get good meta-ratings.  You have to pay to
use other people's ratings.  This is how it should be.)

An Igor-like entity wrote something like this:
Nice design.  :-)
Hm.  That might be an interesting addition to my plan, but the first step is to generate ratings and to consume them at each
individual's mail-handling site.  So I, for example, would run a
script every time I received mail (or every hour, or every day,
etc) which looked for ratings certificates, PGP-verified them,
and saved the rating in a database.  Then I would run another
script (every time I received mail, or every hour, etc.) which
identified incoming messages and _did_ something to them if there were sufficient ratings in the database to merit _doing_
something to them (e.g. delete, promote to a "well-rated"
folder, demote to a "poorly-rated" folder, forward to my
friends, forward to my enemies, etc.).
Now as you astutely note, this is only valuable if you like the
ratings.  Thus it is necessary to have meta-ratings.  The
simplest meta-rating is "rate raters by hand".  That is, you
manually make a list of (potential) raters and put their public
key ID and a coefficient indicating how much you value their
ratings into a meta-ratings database.
More complicated meta-ratings include "how often did I agree
with them", true (acquired from other people) meta-ratings,
and... um..  automated textual analysis or whatever other whacky
heuristic you want to plug in.
This could be so much fun...
P.S.  Oh yeah... The demo.  Just a sec.

Yes, it can be. When I was writing it I had in mind that I want
to write a general moderation bot that can be _applied_ to USENET.
There is a script processApproved which is called when a message should get posted. If you replace the usenet version of processApproved
to mailing list version, you will be done.
Well, STUMP is a generic moderation tool.
So, what you want is a tool that accepts "unmoderated" cpunks list,
selects messages by authors with high ratings, and forwards only
these into the "filtered" list? That's neat _if_ ratings are done
by people whose tastes are similar to mine..

What's the difference?  All practical measure of value is in comparison to competing objects.  This _does_ mean that your

raters got busy, ratings across the board would go down.  (Seems
statistically unlikely, but still...)  Then when they went back
up there would be a "burst of activity" effect.  :-)
Possibly what I like most about ratings and micropayments is how
the quantify previously unquantified human behavior.  We've all
seen the "burst of activity" on a mailing list or at a party, or
on a stock market, right?  Well that is just people's ratings
all pushing each other up!
Which is where the small payments to ratings producers from
ratings consumers comes in.  Again this is just the
quantification of a phenomena that we all take for granted.

Cool stuff, Matthew.  You've gotta think about replay and delay

have authenticated, and reject messages unless they have an authenticated time-stamp later than that one.

@_subject: #E-CASH: PRODUCT OR SERVICE? 
"Ecash" is a registered trademark of DigiCash.  It is registered
with the Benelux trademark office and the United States
trademark office.  I believe that it is considered unwise to use
minor variations on trademarked names, but I'm not an
intellectual property rights lawyer.
I think it would behoove us all to clarify our terms.  I call
Ecash(tm) coins "electronic cash" for several reasons.  Ecash(tm)
has all of the following characteristics in common with
conventional cash, in descending order of importance:
1.  Unforgeability.  Ecash(tm) coins have intrinsic value because they are cryptographically impossible to forge.
2.  Finality.  Payments are cleared on the spot.  No outstanding
payment obligations remain after a purchase.
3.  Bi-directionality.  Payers and recipients use the same software and the same protocol.  It is not necessary for
recipients to be specially trusted by the bank or by the payers.
4.  Privacy.  The privacy of Ecash(tm) payers is mathematically
5.  Composability.  You can make large Ecash(tm) payments out of
a collection of smaller Ecash(tm) coins.  This is in contrast to
a check-based system where you typically draw a check for the
exact amount and transfer only a single check.
6.  Small payments.  Ecash(tm) coins are cheap enough to use that they are practical for small payments.
(As a note, I do not use the word "micropayments" here, because
I am beginning to think that a good technical definition of
"micropayments" is "payments whose value is less than the cost
of using current electronic coins".  This qualifies schemes like
Shamir's and disqualifies, well...  current electronic coins.)
There might be other angles we should talk about here.
I think that the first quality is the defining one, technically.
So, could a knowledgeable person e.g. Mr. Birch tell us why
Mondex should be considered to be "electronic cash"?  And similarly I would like to hear an informed opinion about why Ecash(tm) should not be considered "electronic cash".  I tend to agree that Ecash(tm) would be even _more_ cashlike if it were cleared off-line, but I don't consider that difference very fundamental.  (_Any_ digital money based on our current understandings will have to be cleared at a central clearer eventually, since digital information is perfectly copyable.)
Thank you for your correspondance.

I would call those "good ones", but YMMV.  :-)
This is making me feel kind of sleazy.  For what it is worth I think that Rand has some of the best ideas in philosophy, and
furthermore presented them in a (more or less) integrated system
which has profoundly useful applications to both theoretical
philosophy and everyday life, not to mention dramatically publicizing and popularizing philosophical ideas in a social and
political context.
Rand's ideas are wildly under-rated by most serious thinkers and
wildly over-rated by most of her followers.  It is a shame that her acid polemics, kooky tangents, and personality cult have
distracted most people from her valuable insights.

marginal and which aren't.  Is Frank O. Trotter's salary a
marginal cost?  I mean, if everyone in the world started sending
each other Mark Twain Bank pennies, MTB might have to hire a
second or third banker-type like Frank to keep an eye on things.
But disregarding such speculation, what is the marginal cost of a
kilobyte or so on Mark Twain Bank's internet connection?  Or

Haven't racists engraved markings on people's clothes,

WoT to certify identities, versus using it to certify [...]
other qualities", is that each of these different uses of key-
signings are.. well..  _different_, and they shouldn't be
mistaken for one another.
Unfortunately PGP 2 only allows one kind of certificate.  The
"key-signature".  To PRZ and most other people, it is a
certificate asserting a mapping between a key and a true name.
To me it is as I described above.  To TCMay, it is a kind of
endorsement.  It's just too bad that PGP 2 doesn't have
different _kinds_ of certificates to represent these different
assertions.  Until a certificate technology like that is
implemented, and probably even after that time, we need to
avoid confusing these various meanings for "key-signatures".
Well here we have that epistemological issue again.  I believe
that there is a single "proper" or "best" ontological
interpretation of many or most belief networks.  (At least, of the belief networks that we care about.)  But skipping that
issue, my point in this post is just that there should be
informtion encoded in these belief nets/WoT's which
differentiates the different kinds.
Note that it is possible to differentiate between two meanings
without admitting that their meanings are meaningfully
ascertainable by humans...
Hey, maybe I should be more humble, or more gentle, but this is
the Internet, you know?  Here, I'll present a representation of
my internal Bayesian belief network with explicit mention of the
certainty qualifications:
"A.  Since Tim and I view things differently with respect to
this subject, one of us is wrong.
A's certainty: 0.95
B.  I am right.
B's certainty: 0.93
C.  (from A,B)  Tim is wrong.
C's certainty: (from A,B)  0.93*0.95=0.8835"
Now more seriously, the alacrity with which I bring up disagreements with Tim should in fact be construed as a measure
of my _respect_ for his opinions and for his mind, rather that
as a lack of respect for same.

The Ecash(tm) coins minted by the Mark Twain Bank have a base
value of 0.01 U.S. Dollar.  So in using those coins, you can't
spend less than 0.01 U.S. Dollar unless you adopt some protocol
like only pay every tenth time, or only pay on a 1-in-10 random
chance every time, or something.
But _Ecash(tm)_ itself does not have that restriction.
Different coinages of Ecash(tm), issued by different banks, may
have different base values.
Well how do we represent 0.01 U.S. Dollars in Mark Twain Ecash(tm)?  Easy-- we take a few bits of data, interpret it as an unsigned binary number, and then say "this number is how many
U.S. pennies this coin is worth."
Actually it can sometimes get more complicated than that, and there are some details about how the forthcoming ecashlib handles this to be found at "

Matts, you don't want to do floating point for money, because
floating point doesn't give you good control of precision.  If
you want to know how it _is_ done, RTFAPI ("read the fantastic
API.")  Scan for "EC_Coinage".
Keep in mind that only Ecash(tm) Mints can create Ecash(tm) coins and choose what values the coins have.
I'm glad you are asking these questions.  Perhaps this will be
the start of the Ecash(tm) API FAQ.
(I'm getting tired of typing "(tm)".  I'm going to make a macro
that appends "(tm)" to every instance of "Ecash" as I type

Matts, _floating_ point numbers are numbers in which the decimal
place moves ("floats") around depending on the value of the number.  Floating point numbers are convenient if you want to handle a number that isn't going to be too large, and that isn't
going to need a great deal of precision.  They are _not_ useful if you want to handle a number with a lot of precision, nor
indeed, if you want to be able to _know_ the precision!  If you
have a number that represents money, you want to know the As an aside, there are rare cases when you will use a floating point
number to _represent_ a fixed-point number just because the
floating point math is faster on your hardware.  As far as I know, this only happens on certain supercomputers.
I shall try to refrain from taking umbrage at your comment that
DigiCash is "not real".  Also that DigiCash doesn't "do"
currency.  What could you possibly mean by that?
I'm sorry-- I didn't speak clearly.  _Kinds_ of coins, including
such things as the currency and base value (i.e. smallest possible coin) are created by Mints.  We call these "coinages".
They are analogous to new kinds of coin or paper notes in traditional currency.  The individual coins are generated by the
Ecash(tm) client, but those coins are worthless until they are
stamped by the Mint, giving them a currency and denomination (i.e., is this a 5-dollar-cent coin, a 10-dollar-cent coin, a 100-Finnish-Mark coin, etc.).
For further reading material as well as  the API , I can
recommend  the
Ecash(tm) FAQ ,  the Bryce (not speaking for DigiCash on these pages) FAQ , the
somewhat out-dated  Ecash(tm)
protocol description , and Ian Goldberg's  Ecash(tm) pages
For further reading on floating point and other representations
of numbers in computing, I recommend any good introductory
university text on mathematical computing.  Sorry I don't have
mine handy or I'd give you a specific reference.

Hi again Matts,
This conversation has been thorough enough already that perhaps
it is time to take it off-lists.  I think that you are unaware
of the difference between floating point numbers (e.g. the 'IEEE
754' 32 bit floating point number spec) and fixed-point
numbers which are used to represent amounts other than "units"
of a thing.  (E.g., use a 32-bit integer and say that it
represents millionths of an apple.  You can now represent
anything from 0.000001 apples to 4294.967295 apples with no loss
of precision.)
There are also many other ways to represent different kinds of numbers, including multi-precision integers and rationals, imaginary and complex numbers, etc.  I reiterate that floating point numbers are for convenience when dealing with values whose precision is unimportant.  Anyone who encodes real money into
a float is dumb.
It will be _very_ pretty.  Stay tuned.  :-)

That's interesting.  Because rates never approach 2^23, and because you never need that much precision with rates?  It seems
like a bad idea to me anyway.  Why not just use an Int32 if you don't need that much precision?

An entity known as "Matts Kallioniemi"  wrote something like:
Note "units of the coinage's base value".  The coinage's base
value could be 0.000000007 Lira if the bank so desired.
Unfortunately since the largest EC_Amount in the API is 2^31,
you wouldn't be able to buy much with coins of that type.  :-)
It is more likely that the coinage's base value will be 0.01
U.S. Dollars or 0.0001 U.S. Dollars or something on that order.
If a need arises for a greater range of values, the Ecash(tm)
API can be easily extended by using a larger int for EC_Amount.

Okay.  Normally I would rather argue about viewpoints expressed

pinpoint "views of people calling themselves libertarians", but
in this case it will make little difference to my argument,
which is that your article quoted at the beginning of this
message reflects a misunderstanding of those views.
Hm.  This is as may be, but it is tangential to my purpose in
publically calling you on your (presumably innocent) Sure, I agree with you that Mills doesn't start with rights as
an assumption, but rather argues for them from prior
assumptions.  When I said that Mills argues for "absolute ('unbalanced')" rights, I meant that he argues for individual
rights with (almost) no exceptions, in constrast to your
your assertion that "the main theory it advances is of the *balance* between the rights of communities and the rights of individuals.".  I doubt very much that Mills _ever_ used the
phrase or the concept of "rights of communities" and I know
that the main theory that _On_Liberty_ advances is the (almost)
total sovereignty of individual rights.  (I see now that I shouldn't have called Mills' conception of rights "absolute",
because of the existence of that "almost" there...)
But this, too, is tangential to my point...
Hm.  I was taught that Mills recanted Benthamism and became a
vigorous philosophical adversary of it before writing _On_
_Liberty_.  Are you counting _On_Liberty_-era Mills as some kind of "neo-Benthamite utilitarian" or is one of us mistaken on his self-identification?
But this, too, is tangential to my point, which I will get
around to now.
You wrote, in the article that spawned this thread:
Now I must strongly assert that this _is_ an action that can be
strictly justified in terms of absolute rights as understood
by people who call themselves libertarians.  I don't believe that Dr. Vulis _should_ have been banned from cypherpunks, and I don't believe in absolute rights as understood by people who
call themselves libertarians, but I must state that your assertion quoted above reflects a profound misunderstanding of
that viewpoint.
The idea of absolute rights as understood by libertarians
states that no-one is justified in exercising "the use of
force" against another person unless in self-defense against
similar "use of force" from that person.  [Note:  "the use of
force" is in quotes because it has a particular meaning in this
context which is essential to appreciating the theory.  The
meaning of "the use of force" in this theory is:  "One of: a.
performing physical violence upon the subject, b. threatening
to perform physical violence upon the subject, c. stealing the
subject's property.".]
Now if you are able to read and comprehend the above paragraph
then you must find it obvious that this theory does not forbid
John Gilmore from banning Dr. Vulis from cypherpunks.  If you
are able to read and comprehend the above paragraph and _also_
understand its deficiencies and begged questions, then more
power to you, but you must still admit that the theory, as
understood by people who call themselves libertarians, fully
permits John Gilmore to ban Dr. V.
I look forward to your reply.

a.  "REZIDE", "searchable by congressional district, area code plus exchange, county, state, metropolitan statistical area (MSA) and dominant market area (DMA)" and "providing a detailed
demographic portrait [...] including age, income, race, ethnicity, household composition, employment", a "White/Blue

c.  An assets database identifying real-estate or FAA-registered
aircraft owned by people.
d.  Something called "P-FIND" which is advertised as "having greater detail [than P-TRAK] with regard to the individual's household (value of home, number of dependents)".  This one
appears in a newsletter from 1994, so the service may be
discontinued (although of course the data still exists...).
It would be a fun experiment and a good cypherpunk publicity
stunt to test Lexis-Nexis out.  Pick a demo victim, e.g. a journalist who is honest, smart and concerned about such
issues, but not one who is too famous or rich.  Use Lexis-Nexis
(and possibly other resources) to learn all that you can about him/her.  If he/she lives in a sparsely-populated area a narrow
enough REZIDE search might give income, number of persons in household, marital status, age, schooling, ethnicity, vehicles owned, and employment, and that would be with a single search.

One of the most compelling consequences of strong privacy is
pseudonymity, i.e. the ability to conduct business and personal
affairs without allowing others to learn your physical identity or
location.  This is a very strong protection against extortion, kidnapping and all other kinds of physical violence.
(Its lesser cousin, anonymity, also protects again physical
violence, but it has limited usefulness in business and/or personal
(For example, if a business magnate wishes to manage a vast financial
empire while still allowing her children to grow up in a safe and
open environment, there is probably no better solution than that she
manage her vast financial empire pseudonymously, so that would-be
thugs will not know _who_ to kidnap in order to extort ransom.)
Perhaps Wei Dai should apply his sharp mind to analyzing the net
effect on society of _that_ phenomenon.
The benefit for the individual thus protected is clear, but, as the
Unmentionable Topic shows, it is arguable that the net effect on society (as it were) will be less than optimal.

(In case you are worried, I am good net.citizen who trims Newsgroups: lines, is careful not to take the name of Kibo in vain, and who never trolls for newbies by posting "follow-up to this article to get free nude picture of Sandra Bullock!".  So
_I_, therefore, would faithfully sneakernet my "key not found"
results back to the Net.)

Nope.  I'm thinking of really and truly off-the-net computers.
I wonder how many of them there are that might participate in the DES crack if the input and output can simply be directed to/from a file...

I've suggested it several times.  I'm curious who else has proposed it.
Nice!  I look forward to part 2.  (And part 3, where you go ahead and account for the cost of signing up for digital payment systems and the cost of managing each I think the major problems with the proposal are first making digital payment systems ubiquitous and second making the
"unsolicited mail good faith deposit" idea ubiquitous.
Hm.  If we could somehow make the _idea_ gain.. er.. "currency" then the problem of spammers would cause more people to adopt digital payment systems.  _That_ would be
making a blessing from a curse!

@_subject: Anonymous mail as spam? 
A million monkeys operating under the pseudonym  "Toto " typed:
Actually I had a talk with a certain anti-spam ISP owner
recently, and she asserted that the spammers don't make
significant money from responses to their spams, but are
instead making their money from stupid newbie companies who pay them for advertising service.
It's an interesting proposition.  You would think, though, that
the spamsters might as well just take the stupid newbie
company's cash and then send a couple of token e-mail messages, if that's their business model.  :-)
I concur.  Note that a variation on the "good faith deposit"
idea is to make the included payment an actual, final
_payment_.  If it were small enough, it wouldn't really matter
to the sender (especially since she would probably get a
response back containing a similar payment).  Still, in order
to minimize the economic impact on non-commercial senders, I favor a deposit instead.  (It can be implemented almost as
efficiently as a final payment would...)
Again I assert, though, that this "deposit" shall have no legal
effect.  The cost of possibly incurring legal liability far outweighs the amounts that we are dealing with, effectively killing the whole idea in its cradle.

A million monkeys operating under the pseudonym  "Hal Finney " typed:
This is an excellent question, Hal.  I've been thinking about it since I saw a similar post of yours earlier today.
In the case where the problem of nymity is that one actor can later
prove the fact of the transaction, and this is a cost, I can see how the option of anonymity could make a cheaper transaction possible.  However, I think that this is _not_ the case that Robert
Hettinga is interested in.  I think the case that Bob is talking about is when the cost is the possibility of incurring legal liability from the transaction.
So it is true that _if_ the transactions were unconditionally anonymous, _then_ you would not have the costs of legal liability,
but it does not follow that anonymity is the _only_ way to avoid the cost.
Frankly, I think the best way to avoid that cost in the forseeable
future is the time-tested method of saying "I make no warranties, etc. etc. and incur no contractual obligation blah blah and so forth.", as part of your deal.
I think this can be accomplished done without using any cryptographic technique more complicated than simple Zooko Journeyman
