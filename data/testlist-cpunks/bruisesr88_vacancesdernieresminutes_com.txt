have you seen april's ms living yet? i am going to turn on some good music and choose to be happy.
(so is corned beef if you've never tried it). i love that she's an expert knitter and yet chooses to create very simple pieces; i am craving some sunshine.
she's amazing. but so worth it.
i love the color palette and obvious softness. and it's so yummy
really, cate is also mexican, japanese, native american, swiss, and a lot more- a true american- so we actually have a lot of family history travelling to do, but i really love the romantic beauty of ireland, and have always been drawn to that part of the world. plus i really love corned beef.
in a tiny town in idaho
4. i don't worry about a little "creative clutter" in cate's room. i say, a good dress up/ barbie mess day better than watching tv all afternoon, right? pretty soon i will just put my 'kerchief on again and go to town. (yes, that is what cate's room looks like again, just over a month after the big clean. i tell you, i'm fighting a losing battle with that girl). does that answer your question, mary? i hope it helps! wink.
may you always have courage to take a chance and never find frogs in your underpants.
happy happy days.
i am excited about my new running shoes.
wooohoooo!" my happy little life
they make me smile every day. i am so grateful for quiet time with the scriptures.
good news!
