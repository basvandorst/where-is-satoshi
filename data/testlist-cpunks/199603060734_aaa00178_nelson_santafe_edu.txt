@_subject: Steganography idea: CU-SeeMe 
[Re: data steams to put steno in]
That's an excellent idea.
The only problem with using CU-SeeMe is that, due to the nature of the data being transferred, it is more important to keep up to date than to not lose data.  I believe it uses UDP to do this.  There would have to be some protection mechanism in the stego patches to tolerate high amounts of data loss - the obvious solution would be to loop the data, but that is easily detectable, and is not a guarantee that the data arrived safely.  Setting up a connection outside of Cu-SeeMe attracts attention, especially if there was a correlation between what occurred on that connection and what occurred in the LOBs of the Cu-SeeMe connection.
