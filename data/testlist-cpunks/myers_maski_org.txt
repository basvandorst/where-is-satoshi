References: Try Mnet (  It's the continuation of the Mojo
Nation code base.  We are close to a "stable" release (0.5.1), but there
are a lot of known bugs that we are leaving in the system (because we
are rewriting the code that the bugs are found in).
Our main goal for the next release is to make it easier for new coders
to understand what's going on under the hood.  That and replacing the
single point of failure metatracker system with a distributed hash
table. The old mojo token based system is no longer in use, but we hope to
replace it with an OpenDBS based system, or a stamp based system.

I believe the two critical ones are (with exp dates):
4759064 Blind unanticipated signature systems (19 Jul 2005)
4759063 Blind signature systems (19 Jul 2005) I can't seem to find a database with who currently owns a patent.  I
suspect it doesn't exist, which is unfortunate, since it is we the
people who have given the monopoly on this idea, but we can't find out
*who* has that monopoly. myers

I suspect that at this point the people who actually make the decisions are
about as clueless as Aunt Millie (sorry Aunt Millie).
Actually, if you want to look at the main decision-maker-by-default,
Microsoft, you see that they are pushing NAT traversal.  Why?  Because it
allows them to have neat features like Video/Voice Conf. (which was actually
the key reason we got these UPnP routers at work).
Also take a look at their Three Degrees project.  Key dependency for this is
IPv6 and Teredo [1].  I'm tempted to see if this could be used within Mnet.
I think it's a good idea to take the bull by the horns now and add in
support for these technologies.  Put an indicator on your app to show the
user what kind of connection they have. For example a yellow indicator or,
if you are Peekabooty, a big frowning bear (maybe he could spit at you and
call you names?) when you can't accept incoming connections.  Make them
feel like they aren't getting the full deal.
Make the user want it to the point that the other people who make decisions
(you know "THEM") can't just slip this one by.
