Does anyone have the help-file for the anonymous pool of the extropia-
remailer, the one of ?
In the interest of widespread usage, please post it to the entire list.
If you can, please also let us know if there is a way for us to subscribe
via an anonymous remailer to an address we designate, like for instance
with the command
      subscribe special at address.here
where the special address given is obviously different from the one in the
header of the subscription message (which would merely be a remailer).
