Interestingly, New Jersey's recent Libertarian candidate (Sabrin) lost my
wife's vote when his own ads portrayed him as anti choice.
Several members of the religious right also call themselves libertarians.
Sometimes what is meant is freedom from interference in the market rather
than real freedom.

This sounds superficially equivalent, but FDA labelling requirements are quite different from web labelling. Firstly, unlike religion and politics, which are by nature subjective, effectiveness and safety of a drug can be reasonably determined by objective double blind testing. The room for error can come mainly from invalid protocols or fraud, both of which can be investigated by outside parties. Secondly, looking at a mislabelled web site cannot harm you. Taking a worthless drug can cost your health or your life. Unlike many consumer products, where the market can be allowed to rise or fall on reputation, it is not possible to determine the effectiveness or side effects of drugs from reputation. Only rigorous cohort selection and peer reviewed statistical analysis will suffice.
Additionally requiring verifiably truthful statements on drugs really does qualify as a "narrowly tailored" action. OTOH I don't see any reason to prohibit  people from taking "unapproved" drugs if they do so with full knowledge.

This post has a strange deja vu to it. I can remember back in the '60s when revolutionary wannabes would talk of the glorious peoples paradise while living in their comfortable suburban homes. How the workers' education system was open to all, no one was unemployed...
Now it has come full circle. Singapore is capitalist, so loss of freedoms can be glossed over. Many of us on this list would already be subject to the law for postings critical of government. People are in jail for looking at Penthouse on the net. Here we worry about filtering in libraries, they have whole country filtering. We worry about hate speech codes, they prohibit anything 'promoting racial or religious disharmony' (don't publish the Bell Curve there..), what good is being able to afford a printing press when you need the government's permission to publish. A few years back, at least, there were pictures in the airport of approved haircuts, you could not enter the country if your style did not conform. No first amandment, no fourth, no fifth, and don't even think about getting a gun permit.
It is amazing that people who are so offended by *government action* would gloss over a government that intrudes itself into so many areas of private life.
We are appalled by those who would sell their freedoms for perceived safety. Is it less  foolish to sell *fundamental* freedoms for a few bucks more income?    >From:    	frissell at panix.com

@_subject: Keepers of the keys 
Aside from the privacy principle arguments, there is the very same logistics problem, securely keeping hundreds of millions of keys, fully up to date (many people and operations change keys every day or week) sufficiently secure as to be tamper-ptoof yet sufficently accessible to  retrieve in 2-3 hrs as required by LEAs. They can't even keep much smaller amounts of INS info without major screw-ups.
Interestingly, there is a special federal court which authorizes wire taps on foreign 'national security' targets.  No request has ever been turned down.
The only way to keep keys secure in the long run is to let the owners be responsible for their own security.

In NY (as possibly other places), wearing a bullet resistant vest while doing something illegal is itself a crime. While it might be argued that messing around with guns can hurt bystanders, no one was ever injured by a stray bullet resisting vest.

Elected officials? FBI and NSA lifers are about as far as possible from accountable elected officials. (And the whole point to elected officials is
that they can be influenced by the constituents)
I was told by a House staffer (a relative) that within the FBI many of
the agents resent Freeh, they feel he is giving away the store (!!!) because
of some policies he supposedly has taken to prevent another JE Hoover (though
I can hardly imagine what). Anyhow this staffer said, he would really worry
about such gung-ho agents having access to private communications.

In addition to the good advice that was given on this list to keep your

post. He had commented that the subject of spoofed messages came up in a
discussion with an agent, and the agent asked about what this term meant.
Don't let them draw you into such a discussion. They probably know damn
well what these terms mean, they want to hear what you say they mean. You
are being mind probed.
Be polite, don't let them get you to say something angry or stupid, and say

same as defending the content (though I understand that nowhere do they

Remember, Jodi, the *same* law that should be protecting their speech
protects you and your allies from being prosecuted each time a gay is

How many times do I have to say this. I am *not* protecting them. I am
protecting free speech... my free speech, your free speech.
This is much more dangerous than you seem to realize. It's tempting to let
them get 'theirs' because their ideas are ugly to many of us. But if they
can be held liable for a vicious murder (which they did not advocate or
instigate) on the part of someone who read their site... what keeps you from
being held accountable for someone who reads your site then kills a gay?
What keeps a book author or film director from being criminalized because
some sicko copycats an incident they describe?
This has nothing to do with protecting them, regardless of what they
believe. It is enlightened self interest.

Jodi's fantasy world again.
Ok Jodi..document your claims
which 'march on Washington"
Please specifiy who made these 'demands' and the actual quotes involved
(not your imaginative paraphrases)
Of course, if your past behavior on this list is any indicator, statements
were wildly interpreted to suit your strawman perceptions, and I suspect
actual quotes will not be forthcoming.

Ok, you can reword are reiterate your claims. How about backing them up
with documentation? (if it's been 'reinforced' every year, it surely is not
secret and you must have some links to back up your claims)
BTW of your new ones:
1) Would you NOT have them available to all persons regardless of age? Do
we really need more teenage pregnancies? (BTW in that year many states
restricted access to birth control, my brother's then 17 year old wife
could not purchase it it Cal.)
2) why should people be prohibited from participation in child care because
they are gay, bisexual or lesbian? Perhaps heterosexuals should be
prohibited from child care for the same reasons.
3) Document (not rephrase) this, Jodi
4) Well this country is kind of short on enemies right now since the
disappearance of the evil empire... maybe it's time to attack a real enemy.
This is, of course similar to the last times, wild claims (probably from
some fundie tract) and lots of bluster and no content when challenged to
support the claims.
Aside to Lizard: I'll be gone for a few days but watching my mail when I
get back, try to follow up and make sure we get some documentation. thx
