@_subject: `supercomputer' export control 
Note the date; this is old news.
They're right.
67 NOPS [-) is a single SuperSPARC chip or a fast Pentium.  Nothing
faster than that can be exported without being considered a
"supercomputer", requiring armed guards around it in the foreign
country, etc.  Like, a SPARCstation-10 containing TWO SuperSPARC
The amusing thing is that the chips themselves are not export-controlled.
Foreign clone-makers buy the chips and sell to the rest of the world,
while U.S. companies are fried by endless red tape.  If you can get delivery next week or in six months, which supplier do you pick?
The whole concept of export controls on computers and communications gear
(including cryptography) has got to be demolished.  Smashed to the ground
like the Berlin Wall, a mere memory of decades of totalitarian bureacracy
that ruined real lives and real products.
