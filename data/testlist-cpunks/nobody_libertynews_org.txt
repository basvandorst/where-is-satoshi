@_subject: Privacy/anonymity charities 
The company I work for has a charitable donation matching program. Do you have any suggestions for organizations with 501(c)3 status who would be worthy recipients of a donation? I have EFF and EPIC on my list. Are there others doing things to protect anonymity and privacy rights?
I am more interested in actively working on developing ways of securing people's anonymity, rather than lobbying or litigation organizations. I think that the two I have above cover the latter nicely.
