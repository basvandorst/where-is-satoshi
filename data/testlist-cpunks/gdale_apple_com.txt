Bill Stewart  said:
What you want to avoid is giving any spooks/agents the ability to:
A> Quickly scan GIFs (or whatever) on your hard disk (or .binary.
newsgroups) for files that are "likely" to be hiding something.
B> Be able to prove that you have an encrypted file. If they get that proof
they can apply pressure to you to get the key.
Anything that allows either of the above is only providing moderate security.

@_subject: Encrypted data across international lines 
Does anybody have pointers to the actual statutes prohibiting transmitting
encrypted data across international boundries.
I had an argument with somebody who didn't think this was illegal.
I'm pretty sure you need special permits (export licenses??) for this.

@_subject: Crypto API (was: Software infrastructure) 
I was thinking about a crypto project I have on the backburner (actually
it's just in the concept stage), a program to hide encrypted data in raster
image files.
I really don't want to muck with writing or porting an encryption package,
I just want to do the part that sticks the data into the image.
HERE'S THE BEEF:
I think a lot of the various mail readers and what not would be likely to
encorporate encryption, if only it were mind-bogglingly simple.
An API (Application Programming Interface) could be proposed by cypherpunks
or others. The same folks should probably provide at least one encryption
library for use.
It would be nice if this API allowed for multiple encryption schemes (user
selectable), like the way Apple's Communications Toolbox allows users to
switch between various connection protocols.
I'm much too busy to embark on something like this (largely because I'm not
a cypher expert), but if I can help convince somebody to do it, or to
provide feedback on the interface, I'm available.

@_subject: Term software develo 
Woops, this is what I get by not reading all my mail before posting. I just
posted the same suggestion with considerably less detail.
Anyway, I second what henry says.
