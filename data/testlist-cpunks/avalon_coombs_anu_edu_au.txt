@_subject: ps -laxww for randmoness? 
Well whenever I try to come up with some nifty crypto scheme, I always
seem to think it is too easy to break if you know its being used but then
I dont like doing too much 'expensive' crypting and I usually find some
cheap algo which uses a more expensive one for key trading.
Has anyone tried using the microsecond counter from unix as a random
source ?  Its obviously *not* going to be good if you want a continuous
stream of random numbers, but if you need them just 'every now and then',
what about it ?
Something like this would be used:
Very unlikely to get a duplicate, esp. if you dont need the number
more often than 1 per second.

@_subject: timeofday for randomnessness ? 
Thats why you change key 'regularly'...even randomly ?
Then they have to 'guess' when you change keys.  It might be easy
to tell when an application starts, but how can you tell exactly or
even approximately how long ago someone picked a menu that changed
their key or it was otherwise changed ?
By using the microsecound counted as a random number, its almost
completely random unless you take steps to actually make less so.
But a table of the required million entries and 'init' strings
wouldn't be too hard for todays computers, hence the use of the
time in seconds to 'bump' the offset a bit.
For example, if you use a simple xor table for encoding/decoding,
its pretty easy to decode.  If you change the table after it has
been used, every time, then the required time to break the entire
message is significantly larger than it would otherwise have been.
Can anyone do some maths on exactly how long it would take given
a fixed table size (contains random data) ?  And also with key/
table changes at a fixed/random interval ?
(seems 1:1 :( but I maybe wrong).

@_subject: Datalink encryption 
Hi, I've started playing around with doing encryption with telnet/telnetd
again (I'm cheating and using the rsa/prime number code from pgp-2.0)
and I'm stuck on what to use as the encryption for the actual flow of data.
(hmm...if it works for telnet/telnetd, it can probably be made to work for
 the other r-daemons too :-)
The idea is telnet and telnetd each choose an rsa pub & sec key, then use
rsa to encode a key for the encryption scheme which both ends send and
then use that for the base of the link encryption.
Whatever I use for encryption of the session data has to work quickly
and efficiently and I've got little idea about what to use/how to
and would like some opinions on what would make a good choice.
Any suggestions ?  (Xor seems a possibility but straight Xor is very
easy to break).
I hope I'm not duplicating work that has already been done :)

@_subject: How far is to far? 
I've fixed the IP bouncer so it doesnt chew so much cpu any more,
backgrounds itself and detachs from the tty.  In testing last night,
it was using less %cpu than the telnet being used to connect to it on
the same machine (hope that bodes well! :).

@_subject: terminal progs to do pgp... 
Rather than rewrite the terminal progs, why not rewrite the BIOS level
drivers and such ? (if its possible).
At least this way, it would be one hack which would work on all terminal
programs...you'd just need a way to turn it on/off which I'm sure wouldn't
be that hard :-)

Some of the topics in the wide-ranging CFP'93 program will include:
ELECTRONIC DEMOCRACY - looking at how computers and networks are changing democratic institutions and processes.
ELECTRONIC VOTING - addressing the security, reliability, practicality and legality of automated vote tallying systems and their increasing use.
CENSORSHIP AND FREE SPEECH ON THE NET - discussing the problems of maintaining freedom of electronic speech across communities and cultures.
PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST ON THE NET - probing the problems and potential of new forms of artistic expression enabled by computers and networks.
DIGITAL TELEPHONY AND CRYPTOGRAPHY - debating the ability of technology to protect the privacy of personal communications versus the needs of law enforcement and government agencies to tap in.
HEALTH RECORDS AND CONFIDENTIALITY - examining the threats to the privacy of medical records as health care reform moves towards increasing automation.
THE MANY FACES OF PRIVACY - evaluating the benefits and costs of the use of personal information by business and THE DIGITAL INDIVIDUAL - exploring the increasing capabilities of technology to track and profile us.
GENDER ISSUES IN COMPUTING AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS - reviewing the issues surrounding gender and online interaction.
THE HAND THAT WIELDS THE GAVEL - a moot court dealing with legal liability, responsibility, security and ethics of computer and network use.
THE POWER, POLITICS AND PROMISE OF INTERNETWORKING - covering the development of networking infrastructures, domestically and worldwide.
INTERNATIONAL DATA FLOW - analyzing the  issues in the flow of information over the global matrix of computer networks and attempts to regulate it.
The conference will also offer a number of in-depth tutorials on subjects including:
* Information use in the private sector
* Constitutional law and civil liberties
* Investigating telecom fraud
* Practical data inferencing
* Privacy in the public and private workplace
* Legal issues for sysops
* Access to government information
* Navigating the Internet For more information on the CFP'93 program and advance registration call, write or email to:

Disturbing pattern that CERT contact people about hosts which perform

was a proprietry 1-way algorithm, but not DES based (so as to avoid
US export laws).

@_subject: Internet Relay Chat 
With some experimentation, it is possible to have partially anonymous
channels (all messges to/from the channel can appear as a singular name)
but all inter-server messages must retain full identity which is a loss.
Also, commands such as "/who  and "/names  currently
return full info...and "/whois" will show you being on it...these can
be changed, easily enough, but to have text traverse server-server with
no id. would not work if you desired /kick and /mode.  I'll work on
fixing these three commands tonight.
I might add, that this seriously screws with the most common (ircII)
client and any others which keep their own private channel membership
lists because the same person always enters and leaves >:-)
Do cypherpunks believe this kind of anonymity is of any use ?

But, there is a catch...you only get traffic for  if your server is
meant to see it...ie someone on your server is on that channel or your
server forms part of the spanning tree for that channel.  It's not
difficult, but if you get caught..*ouch*

@_subject: PGP ban rumor - any truth? 
Saw it on a bookshelf here, yesterday, for AUS$86.00.
Next to it was anoher book on Cryptography, for $97.95 by "Rhee", I didn't
have pen/paper to get the details down, but it was hardback and seemed to
be a good compliement to "Applied Cryptography" as it delt (almost purely
from a quick browse) with the theroies and mathematics of it, rather than
giving C source code for bits and pieces.
Are either of these worth their weight in gold ? (so to speak)

@_subject: Clipper questions... 
Umm, with Clipper, will it be illegal to use other encryption in
addition to clipper ?
ie text -> des -> clipper -> des -> text
Or is that (other encryption being illegal) likely to be a result
of followup legislation ?
And also, how will anyone know if you are without several court
orders ? :-)  At least, now for the NSA, they don't have to worry
about legalities when it comes to decrypting DES (assuming they can)
so why would they push for Clipper if it restricted them more ?
(Sorry, I don't read much of the flame wars on this after the first
 few responses, if this has already been brought up)

Has anyone got an encrypted version of that port bouncer program done yet ?
And a `client' to go with it (be useful).

but does anyone have any suggestions for rlogin or just disable it ?

Do the station staff ever use them ?
Here in Melbourne, all the underground railway stations have cameras
pointing at escalators, up and down the platforms, etc, but if you're
doing something silly like riding around on a chair that the ticket
guys usually sit upon, you can expect an announcement :)  There is also
a window that looks into a `monitor' room from a public walkway at one.
Oh, and one of the cameras looking up a platform has gum fixed to part
of the cover in front of the lens :)

'The virtual anarchists pose another security problem for the Internet
because they have formed an organised group aimed at sabotaging US
Government moves to enfore digitial signiatures on the Internet to allow
authorities to identify the source of all messages on the system.
   According to Listwin, opponents of the scheme have begun advertising
for "top-notch nerds" to join the group.
   "It's like the spy movies where secret agents do blind drops of
information.  People are doing blind drops on the Internet so that you
don't know where the messages come from," Listwin said.'
(from an article on the 'recent' breakin at Cisco, The Age, 15/4/94,
 Charles Wright.  Don Listwin is Cisco's vice-pres. of marketting.  As
 a result of this breakin, he says Cisco will move to hand held response
 challenge cards).
Anyone got any suggestions for replies I could send back to the author,
relating to the subject of anonymity, digitial signiatures, etc ?

Are there any bills being considered for congress which would remove

I think I remember this being talked about earlier on this list..has
it gone anywhere ?  (It was needed so that US companies could compete
with foreigners in this market or some such).
Obviously that ammendment is going to need further application if it
only affects export controls.
