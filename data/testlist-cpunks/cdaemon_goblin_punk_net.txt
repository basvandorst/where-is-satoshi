Do any of the posting remailers accept the inclusion of regional usenets
in their active files so that people can use them to post directly to regional newsgroups?

OK, somebody correct me if I'm wrong here, I haven't used anon.penet
since I got mixmaster running ...
When you send a message to someone at anon.penet, the anonymous remailer
assumes that, since you're using a remailer, you want to be anonymous.
So it gives you an account, sends your message on via that account, and
informs you of the account information.  If you try it a second time,
you're already in the database, so you don't hear from them again.
So if you make your first post to cypherpunks, and somebody has subscribed
to the list via the anon.penet remailer ...

Timothy May writes (with tongue firmly in cheek):
Of course, it might work in the Macro realm:
Large amounts of capital are suddenly invested in the previously underfunded
Internet.  Sudden demand for scarce TCP/IP specialists sends salaries
soaring, causing Federal Reserve to tighten credit in fear of inflation };->

Brad Dolan asks:
a)  Knowledge jobs require tremendous capital investment, as in degrees,
training, continual updating of skills, etc.  If the knowledge  worker
cannot recoup these investment costs via a higher salary, she will not
invest in the training.
b)  Knowlegde jobs require computers, automation equipment, etc. for the
knowledge to be applied to in order to create wealth.  These also require
capital investment.
c)  As rote manufacturing jobs are replaced by "quasi-intelligent" machinery,
human job focus switches to designing, caring for, and replacing those machines.
Example:  The ATM replaces the bank teller, requiring new jobs in ATM design,
manufacturing, repair, and the control of the computer network in the back-
Good jobs of the future may be knowledge jobs, but they require tremendous
capital investment, both by employee and employer.
In theory, this results in less spending and more saving.  More saving results in more investment capital (instead of spending on consumption),
lowering borrowing costs and resulting in business expansion, stimulating
both hiring and salaries to grow (at least until the Federal Reserve gets
into the act).
The second argument is that corporate earnings are actually taxed twice,
once at the  corporate level, and again when they are distributed to
share-holders as either dividends or as capital gains.
In actual practice, well, your mileage may vary.  For further info, see
any Macro Economics 101  textbook.

James A. Donald opines:
One large change, which has been discussed previously on the list, is that
management is becoming more and more a function of specifying WHAT is to
be done, rather than HOW it is to be done.  This leads to a business model
based more on the independent contractor (whether it's a single individual,
or a business that does 'outsourcing' work) than the traditional industrial
assembly line.
Add ubiquitous high-speed data communications networks, and suddenly
national governments become not only irrelevant, but actual impediments
to a free market economy.  Potholes, if you will, on the information
superhighway (attribution to T. May).  The structural changes are many.  Worldwide regulatory and tax arbitrage.
Elimination of the entire job category of 'middle management'.  Capital
in the form of knowledge and reputation rather than fixed physical assets.
Intentionally temporary organizational structures.  Individual responsibility
for what used to be called 'benefits'.
I'm a networking consultant.  My father had three jobs in his entire
lifetime.  I had three jobs this morning.  If that's not structural change,
I don't know what is.

Mike M Nally chimes in with:
None of this has anything to do with terrorism, or any of the other
'horsemen'.  It has to do with the survival of national governments as
we presently know them.  These people are not completely stupid.
Totally secure, world-wide data networks WILL spell the end of national
governments.  This cannot be allowed.  The horsemen aspect is just there
for popular consumption.
