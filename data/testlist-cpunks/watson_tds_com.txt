@_subject: Article on PGP flaws 
Actually it's Computers and Security.  Complains about the PRNG.  Says if someone gets your randseed.bin they can infer the PRNG output sequence and your IDEA key.  Doesn't develop in any detail.  Says the IDEA key should be chosen from _truly_ random numbers.
And this is an expensive magazine.

Did anybody see the movie Demolition Man?  Biometrics were "hacked" there.  I guess it's hard to be sure, but it seems something in your brain is tougher to extract than a finger or an eyeball.  The texts say a combination is a good idea.

@_subject: your bogus post 
Some of you must have missed the superbowl ads where people and frogs were getting frozen to beverage cans, and movie actors moved the grand canyon with a horse.  Marketing is a fact of life.  Seems to me the irresponsibile thing too many of our society do is put too much stock in the marketeers.  I usually select products on their merits, not on the marketing.  Maybe you do too.  But the marekting works, and companies have to use it to stay profitable.
So, what do you think of their product?

tcmay's approach is elegant, and it's refreshing to find a practical use for AI approaches.  I think it needs one more step, though.  If we learn to quantify our trust in a key, we still need to know what the threshold should be for a given application.  Maybe I can get by with a 0.05 Bel for posting to cypherpunks, but maybe I want a 0.95 for a monetary transaction.  Seems to need a comprehensive risk management approach,

Joe Shea, Editor-in-Chief of The American Reporter, said:
that agree with you?  I didn't see my first two, and this one only came
with your response.  Is this your version of freedom of the press, or what?
Maybe Joe would agree to publish everything we send him if we agree to
publish everything he sends us.
Love to get published

NetSurfer said:  If you know a valid email address on the spammers system you can always
bounce each message back to them.  If enough people turned the messages
back on them it might give them the opportunity to experience first hand
what its like to receive tons of mail you don't want or need...
Doesn't seem to work that well.  The "green card lawyers" were reported
to have received hate-mail in the hundreds of thousands.  The happily waded
through it all and pulled out a few valid replies who apparently made it
all a net profit for them, apparently.  What we really need is to improve
our defensive filtering mechanisms.  Someday soon we'll all have our own
personal software agents that will handle all this stuff for us.
