You are a fool then.  Religion and sexism and groups all have nothing

See, there you go again, attacking the person, instead of the

No, all censorship shall be eliminated from this Net and I will
fight to the death to achieve that.  The only way to stop us is to
kill all of us, and you can not do that.  I have 6 or 8 associates
that you are unaware of, and we plan to KILL the current system real
So you plan on censoring me?  Not likely sonny boy.  I have more

proposition that MOST of the problem people currently on UseNet
are "confirmed" homosexuals.  Here is a list of three of the
biggest problem people, and they are ALL problem people.
J.D. Falk
Peter Berger
John Gilmore
Of course, tale and Chris lewis have not been confirmed as
homosexuals, so the percentage of "homos per.problem humanoids" will
Nonetheless, the inordinately high percentage of homosexuals in the
newsgroup administration is probably explained by the same social
factors as the extremely high number of jews in the medical and legal
professions and the high number of blacks in sports.

Jewish Supremacy:
Those Who Want to Dominate a Multiracial Society Are Racial
Supremacists; Those Who Want to Live in a Healthy, Homogeneous Society
Are Racial Separatists.
by Kevin Alfred Strom  Have you ever noticed the psychological phenomenon in which a person
will often call attention to the real or imagined faults in others that
he himself suffers from? The name of this phenomenon is projection, and
it certainly crops up often in life: the mentally unbalanced man
accusing others of being "crazy"; the extremely jealous woman accusing
her husband of not trusting her; the habitual schemer accusing his
co-workers of plotting against him; the greedy man excoriating his
fellows for being selfish; etc.  This phenomenon is nowhere more apparent than in the controlled media's
readiness to accuse anyone who believes in White survival of being what
they call a "White supremacist." This has to be the most egregious
example imaginable of the pot calling the kettle black.  Actually, it is more like the pot calling the silverware black, since
most of those accused of being � "White supremacists," or in
illiterate-speak, "White supremists" [sic], are actually White
separatists, a very important distinction. It is the largely Jewish
masters of the media who are supremacists supreme.  A separatist desires that his people should have freedom and
independence from domination by other peoples, and to that end he works
for the day when his people shall be able to live and provide for
themselves in their own nation, without the burden of an underclass or
overclass comprised of other peoples. A separatist specifically does not
desire to be an overclass. He does not want to rule over any other
people. In fact, a separatist does not want a multiracial society at
all.  A supremacist, on the other hand, wants and demands a multiracial
society. In this multiracial society he wishes his race or social group
to be the dominant one. The fact that this desire is usually cloaked in
pretensions of beneficent intentions and "the greatest good for the
greatest number" should not obscure the fact that it is a master/servant
relationship that the supremacist wants. White Americans who promoted
Black slavery in this country during the first half of the 19th Century
could properly be called supremacists. White American businessmen who
support increased Third World immigration to provide themselves
with cheap labor are essentially supremacists. The White upper class
have abandoned their own people, but they daub their unconscionable
piggish greed and treason with a fake gilding of "tolerance" which they
themselves neither believe nor practice.  The world champions of hypocrisy when it comes to ethnic supremacy,
however, have to be the organized Jews. Dominant in the Hollywood/New
York cultural axis, when anyone challenges their interests they are
quick to denounce with the words that they have made into terms of
opprobrium: "racist," "White supremacist," etc. In their movies and
their newscasts they are zealous in their promotion of the idea of a
multiracial, multicultural society in which all live in perfect harmony.
In fact, the genesis of this "multicultural" moral and social construct
was with the leftist media Jews and their allies, as they themselves
admit in private Jewish publications (see previous article, "Yiddishkeit
Pathology." But a careful examination of organized Jewry's attitudes
towards other races reveals a quite different face from that presented
to the public. In fact, it can be fairly said that Jewish religion and
Jewish practice exemplify racial supremacy at its most hateful and its
most outrageous. In truth, after examining definitive Jewish religious
documents one can be forgiven for thinking that racism just might have
been invented by the Jews. Let's take a look at the record.  A few years ago a friend of mine, after a long evening discussing
politics and conspiracy, asked me, "If there really were a Jewish plan
to dominate and enslave us as you say, surely someone would have
defected and spilled the beans on his fellow conspirators."  "Well," I replied, "I agree that would be the very best evidence of
all."  I can tell you now that such evidence not only exists, but it is
plentiful. It is not all in one place, and one has to examine the
testimony of more than one individual to get the complete picture, but
there are indeed defectors from what my friend called the "Jewish
conspiracy." I am not sure how well the word "conspiracy" now applies to
a domination presently being conducted more and more out in the open,
but a conspiracy it once was, and defectors it has surely had, though
not all of them would have claimed that title. Long-time readers will be
familiar with the names of a few of these: Benjamin H. Freedman, Alfred
Lilienthal, Victor Ostrovsky, Samuel Roth, Marcus Eli Ravage, Noam
Chomsky, Israel Shahak. Each provides a piece of truth that the ruling
establishment does not wish you to know.  Today let us examine Israel Shahak. Israel Shahak is a professor
emeritus at Hebrew University and longtime Israeli dissident. Israel
Shahak is a liberal Jew who excoriates "Nazis" repeatedly and
vociferously in his writings. Israel Shahak is himself a former resident
of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp during World War II. He was
raised as an Orthodox Jew. He is a Jew who settled in Palestine in 1945
and was witness to the founding of the state of Israel. And he is a
powerful opponent of Jewish hypocrisy.  The extraordinary thing about Israel Shahak is that he does not have a
double standard for Jews and non-Jews when it comes to racial supremacy.
Shahak is against racial supremacy whether practiced by Jews or
non-Jews, and he finds that it is practiced extensively by Jews and is
in fact part of their religious traditions. Professor Shahak finds this
morally disturbing and not in the long-term interests of Jews. Professor
Shahak has published a book which examines the issue of Jewish racism in
detail, Jewish History, Jewish Religion: The Weight of 3,000 Years.  Israel Shahak says that Judaism and its teachings are "poisoning the
hearts and minds" of its followers and have been doing so for thousands
of years. In a recent forum at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, he acknowledged that Jews have been persecuted in the past,
but emphasized that today "it is quite common that a persecuted group
becomes the persecutor."
 One of Shahak's favorite activities is translating the Hebrew press
into English for the edification of the rest of us, a practice which has
earned him the burning hatred of many in the Jewish establishment. One
article he translated recently, by Israeli journalist Tom Segev, relates
the writer's random walk through Jerusalem in the company of an Arab
lawyer. The lawyer was stopped repeatedly by Israeli guards and his
identification papers were demanded. One guard ordered him, "Come here,
jump." Then the guard dropped his papers on the road and, laughing,
demanded that the Arab pick them up. Aside to the Jewish journalist the
guard stated, "These people will do whatever you tell them to do. If I
tell him to jump, he will jump. Run, he will run. Take your clothes off,
he will take them off. If I tell him to kiss the wall, he will kiss it.
If I tell him to crawl on the road, won't he crawl? . . . Everything.
Tell him to curse his mother and he will curse her too." The guard
continued, offering his opinion that the Arabs are "not human beings."
The border guards then searched the lawyer, gratuitously slapping him,
and ordered him to remove his shoes, warning him that they could order
him to remove all his clothes if they so chose. Segev continues: "My
Arab kept silent and sat down on the ground." The border guards laughed
and said again, "Really, not humans."  This, of course, is a relatively mild example of the attitude of many
Jews toward Gentiles, but it suffices to show the mentality involved.  Shahak, in an article entitled "The Ideology Behind the Hebron
Massacre," gives us some additional recent examples of this widespread
Jewish attitude. He translates a few of the statements of a religious
group in Israel called the Gush Emunim, which, according to Shahak,
"enjoy[s] [Yitzhak] Rabin's friendship and strong influence in wide
circles of the Israeli and diaspora Jewish communities."  This sect states that Jews are not and cannot be a normal people.  One of their leaders, Rabbi Schlomo Aviner, stated,". . . while God
requires other normal nations to abide by abstract codes of justice and
righteousness, such laws do not apply to Jews.�  Rabbi Israel Ariel states, "A Jew who kills a non-Jew is exempt from
human judgment, and has not violated the prohibition of murder."  According to Gush Emunim rabbis, "all Arabs living in Palestine are
thieves because since the land was once Jewish, all property to be found
on that land really belongs to the Jews."  These Jewish fanatics feel invincible. They possess one of the world's
most powerful military machines (built up by five billion or more U.S.
dollars in annual aid) and have plenty of potential American cannon
fodder at their disposal. They state: "Israel need have no fear of
future wars, and can even provoke them at will . . . Even if there is
peace, we must instigate wars of liberation in order to conquer . . ."  In Shahak's article former Knesset member Rabbi Eliezar Waldman, who is
now the director of the main Jewish school in Kiryat Arba, expresses the
view "that by fighting the Arabs, Israel carries out its divine mission
to serve as the heart of the world . . . while Arab hostility springs,
like all anti-Semitism, from the world's recalcitrance against being
saved by the Jews, . . . or from Arabs seeking to fulfill their
collective death-wish."  Shahak recounts the answer of a rabbi who was asked by an Israeli
soldier if it was proper to kill Arab women and children. The rabbi's
answer was a quote from the Jewish holy book, the Talmud "The best of
the gentiles . . . kill him; the best of snakes . . .dash out its
brains." Some holy book; some religion!  Shahak contends that Jews are imbued with such attitudes to the degree
that they are immersed in Judaism. In his book he explores the
 "According to the Jewish religion, the murder of a Jew is a capital
offense and one of the three most heinous sins (the other two being
idolatry and adultery). Jewish religious courts and secular authorities
are commanded to punish, even beyond the limits of the ordinary administration of justice, anyone guilty of murdering a Jew . . . When
the victim is a Gentile, the position is quite different. A Jew who
murders a Gentile is guilty only of a sin against the laws of Heaven,
not punishable by a court. To cause indirectly the death of a Gentile is
no sin at all. "Thus, one of the two most important commentators on the Shulhan 'Arukh
explains that when it comes to a Gentile, "one must not lift one's hand
to harm him, but one may harm him indirectly, for instance by removing a
ladder after he had fallen into a crevice . . . there is no prohibition
here, because it was not done directly." "A Gentile murderer who happens to be under Jewish jurisdiction must be
executed whether the victim was Jewish or not. However, if the victim
was Gentile and the murderer converts to Judaism, he is not punished. Shahak reveals that according to the Talmud: "Sexual intercourse between a married Jewish woman and any man other
than her husband is a capital offense for both parties, and one of the three most heinous sins. The status of Gentile women is very
different. The Halakhah presumes all Gentiles to be utterly promiscuous
and the verse "whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue [of
semen] is like the issue of horses" is applied to them . . . Therefore,
the concept of adultery does not apply to intercourse between a Jewish
man and a Gentile woman; rather the Talmud equates such intercourse to
the sin of bestiality . . . "According to the Talmudic Encyclopedia: "He who has carnal knowledge of
the wife of a Gentile is not liable to the death penalty, for it is written: `thy fellow's wife' rather than the alien's wife . . . and
although a married Gentile woman is forbidden to the Gentiles, in any
case a Jew is exempted." "This does not imply that sexual intercourse between a Jewish man and a
Gentile woman is permitted -- quite the contrary. But the main
punishment is inflicted on the Gentile woman; she must be executed, even
if she was raped by the Jew: "If a Jew has coitus with a Gentile woman,
whether she be a child of three or an adult, whether married or
unmarried, and even if he is a minor aged only nine years and one day .
. . because he had willful coitus with her she must be killed, as is the
case with a beast, because through her a Jew got into trouble."
"If a Jew finds property whose probable owner is Jewish, the finder
is strictly enjoined to make a positive effort to return his find by
advertising it publicly. In contrast, the Talmud and all the early
rabbinical authorities not only allow a Jewish finder to appropriate an
article lost by a Gentile, but actually forbid him or her to return it .
. . "It is forbidden to defraud a Jew by selling or buying at an
unreasonable price. However, fraud does not apply to Gentiles, for it is
written: �Do not defraud each man his brother . . . The Halakhah
interprets all such idioms [as �each man his brother� or �neighbor�] as
referring exclusively to one's fellow Jew. "In 1962 a part of the Maimonidean Code . . . the so-called Book of
Knowledge, which contains the most basic rules of Jewish faith and practice, was published in Jerusalem in a bilingual edition, with the
English translation facing the Hebrew text. The latter has been restored
to its original purity, and the command to exterminate Jewish infidels
appears in it in full: "It is a duty to exterminate them with one's own
hands." In the English translation this is somewhat softened to: "It is
a duty to take active measures to destroy them." But then the Hebrew
text goes on to specify the prime examples of "infidels" who must be
exterminated: "Such as Jesus of Nazareth and his pupils, and Tzadoq and
Baitos [the founders of the Sadducean sect] and their pupils, may the
name of the wicked rot." Not one word of this appears in the English
text on the facing page (78a). And, even more significant, in spite of
the wide circulation of this book among scholars in the English-speaking
countries, not one of them has, as far as I know, protested against this
glaring deception.  Jew Israel Shahak has done the world a great service. He has been
intellectually honest and very courageous. In Israel he speaks against
Judaism at a very real risk to his life so as to reveal the truth about
the most long-standing and utterly hostile racism the world has ever
seen: Jewish racism.  Israel Shahak's works make it clear that the new religion of "equality"
promoted by the Jewish establishment is for Gentile consumption only.
Organized Jews promote "equality," but they believe in the very
opposite. They believe that they are a special, chosen people, destined
to rule all others and to own all the wealth of the world. They are
fanatical about preserving their heritage and their identity, their
exclusive Jewish schools, and their organizations. The prevailing Jewish
world view is a textbook example of the racial supremacy they are so
fond of accusing others of having.  What can we learn from this? I assure you it is not my purpose to
promote hatred or racial supremacy from our side of the racial divide.
The very fact that I devote so much space to truth-telling Jewish
dissidents should prove that.  I think we can learn a lot from an unbiased observation of Jewish
activities. First we must acknowledge that they have been amazingly
successful at surviving. Surrounded by often hostile majorities, they
have preserved their identity, their culture, and the germ of their
racial uniqueness through millennia. For that we can credit their
intense sense of identity and solidarity and their belief in themselves
as a people. I deeply wish that we Europeans could emulate them in this
regard, for then our survival would be assured.  But I cannot recommend their hypocrisy as an example to be followed.
This hypocrisy always leads them to practice a supremacist rather than a
separatist way of life. Despite some Zionist denials the Jewish way of
life shows every sign of continuing on its perpetual path of living
among other peoples as a solid, organized minority and attempting to
gain the upper hand in Gentile nations by promoting the poisonous idea
of a raceless society. This destructive and hypocritical approach is
sure death for the Gentiles, of course, and in the long run always
backfires on the Jews. That is precisely what Professor Shahak is
worried about.  I think that racial separatism, not supremacy, is the only path to
independence and freedom for all peoples on this planet. It is also a
path that is in harmony with our natural instincts. Our instincts -- all
of them -- are there for very important reasons, and we would not be
what we are if it were not for the instincts which led us to survive the
rigors of Ice Age Europe and to consider ourselves fundamentally
different from peoples who developed closer to the Equator.

Cops can never be trusted to "dispense justice," and half of the
cops are themselves criminals in what they do.  Most cops steal
evidence and lie like crazy in Court.  All they want is a conviction,
and it mattters not how it is obtained.
I would trust robots more than humanoids.

Interesting analysis here, but remember; libel is just one kind of
"defamation" and an action for defamation will always be actionable.
The constitution gives us the right to call the President a
motherfucker any time we want to, and it also gives the motherfucker

You may be able to replace the "Letter of the Law" but you can not

I refuse to type like a geek with those "`" characters)  So, humanoids
will always be entitled to a jury of their "peers" as the constitution
says, and that means no AI involved.
AI was made for usenet management.
The 12 to 0 verdict will always be the bias in favor of the defendant,
and it must stay that way.
With the different combinations of Perl and Java and Lisp that are
around today, the time will come when an android or an AI bot will
have become dangerous to society, and charged with a crime.
Will it be entitled to a jury of it's peers?
