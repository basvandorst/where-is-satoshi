Are you sure there was nothing that could be construed as pornographic
on your PC?  Nothing in the cache?  Nothing deleted but not overwritten?
Nothing hiding in the unused space as the end of a sector?  Have you
never accessed a page only to find it contains pornography (or an ad for
the same)?

The difference is custom officials don't have a scan tool for your
