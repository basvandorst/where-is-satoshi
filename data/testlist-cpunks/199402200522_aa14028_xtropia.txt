@_subject: Updated Remailer List/Helpfile? 
Anonymous at extropia asked:
My remailer list is still availiable by sending mail to
mg5n+remailers at andrew.cmu.edu
I just updated it yesterday to remove the remailers that Karl Barrus
said have gone down.  Also it seems that remailer at entropy.linet.org
isn't working anymore.  I tried it and have gotten no responses after
several days.
