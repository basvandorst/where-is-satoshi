@_subject: [guardian-dev] BREACH: SSL is pwnd 
in summary, you need to turn off gzip to mitigate this for now:
At last week's Black Hat conference, researchers announced the BREACH
a new attack on web apps that can recover data even when secured with SSL
connections. The BREACH
contains full details (and is a good and fairly easy read).
Given what we know so far, we believe that *BREACH may be used to
compromise Django's CSRF protection*. Thus, we're issuing this advisory so
that our users can defend themselves.
BREACH takes advantage of vulnerabilities when serving compressed data over
SSL/TLS. Thus, to protect yourself from BREACH, you should disable
compression of web responses. Depending on how your application is
deployed, this could take a couple forms:
   1. Disabling Django's GZip
   .
   2. Disabling GZip compression in your web server's config. For example,
   if you're using Apache you'd want to disable
   in nginx you'd disable the gzip module
   .
Additionally, you should make sure you disable TLS compression by adjusting
your server's SSL
We plan to take steps to address BREACH in Django itself, but in the
meantime we recommend that all users of Django understand this
vulnerability and take action if appropriate.
