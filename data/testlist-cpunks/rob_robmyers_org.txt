Yes, Amazon volunteered to cut off Wikileaks, which demonstrates that the degree of freedom that EC2 instances give you are very limited -
Eben Moglen gave a very good talk about the issues of privacy and control that I think are at the heart of the question you raise, recommending that people run servers on computing machinery that they physically control -
It's possible to implement Moglen's ideas with current technology: here's a "wall wart" plug server in the corner of my living room running GNU social on Debian -
And here's a project to create a distro specifically for such devices -

There can.
Both restore rights that copyright otherwise restricts.
The GPL ensures that you are free to use the software even if you
receive it from a third party.
BSD doesn't do that.
Therefore BSD "grants" less freedom than the GPL.
