@_subject: PolicyMaker paper available 
I now work from a paperless office and find postscript an "obscure
printer code".  It has taken an annoying amount of hacking to view this
postscript file on my PC.
On the strength of this recomendation I did the hacking and make it
available for the "convenience" of others in the same boat.
This page consists on Matt's original message plus 10 inline gif images
of about 40Kb each.  Clumsy but effective.
