You can't.
As has already been pointed out on the list, the key servers have nothing
to do with binding keys to humans (or other entities, presumably :-).
Only a trusted (by you) key signature can do that; the key servers merely
serve as a way to distribute the keys.
The way to "certify" a key as belonging to a True Name is (again, as has
already been pointed out) to have a signing key that goes along with some
policy.  That gives keys signed by that key some level of trust, depending
of course on how stringent the policy and how much you trust the signer
not to be fooled (or malicious).
If someone wishes to only deal with cyberspacial entities that have
Certified True Names, then that someone can easily take steps to do so.
(And if that someone decides that I'm simply a "brand new Tentacle" or
whatever, that's not my problem; I'm easy enough to verify as a human, if
it's that big a deal...)

Have you read the article in _The New Republic_, titled "Mitch Kapor: Data
Highway Guru"?  It's been conveniently electronified and is included in
O'Reilly's _Global Network Navigator_ hyperzine, even.  (Mail info at gnn.com
for details.)
This quote's well within fair use size, given the size of the article:
   Kapor supports a nationwide fiber grid, and sees ISDN as a transitional
   step, not a substitute. Still, he does oppose big government financing
   for fiber, and this financing did seem a live prospect in January,
   after Gore's ambitious campaign rhetoric. Gore now says he was
   misinterpreted and had never envisioned a big government role. In any
   event, the interest in ISDN stoked by EFF and Markey helped end
   discussion of any such role.
I highly encourage you all to give the article a look; since GNN is free,
