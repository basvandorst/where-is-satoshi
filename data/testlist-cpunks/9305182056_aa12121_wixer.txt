@_subject: Mixing ciphertext and plaintext 
If you wish to mix plaintext and ciphertext in an email message then
you can use Dolphin Encrypt.  Let's say your message is to consist of
P1/C2/P3, plaintext/ciphertext/plaintext, where C2 is ciphertext
derived from plaintext P2.  What you do is put P2 into a file F.TXT,
then run Dolphin Encrypt with a command such as:
                       DE E F.TXT F.ENC /t
After you give Dolphin Encrypt the encryption key F.ENC will be a file
which consists of pseudo-uuencoded ciphertext (that's what the "/t" is
for).  Run your mailer program.  Write your P1.  ASCII-upload F.ENC,
which is your C2.  (No need to mark the beginning/end of the
ciphertext block.)  Finish off with your P3 and send your message.
The recipient captures the entire message as, say, G.ENC, then runs:
                       DE D G.ENC G.DEC /t
(Of course, she has to know the encryption key.)  Dolphin Encrypt
skips over P1 to get at C2 and writes G.DEC containing P2.  Voila!
