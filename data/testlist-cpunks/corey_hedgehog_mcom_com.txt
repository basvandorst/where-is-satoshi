@_subject: Cypherpunks reference in Netscape book 
I'm writing the "Encryption and SSL" chapter for the Netscape products, and
I'm finishing it up with a "Further reading" section that lists
crypto-related books, web sites, and newsgroups. I was thinking of including
a reference to this mailing list.
Any strong opinions either way?
As I see it, the downside is a possible increase in confused people
(specifically on the mailing list--not in general from my writing) and a
decrease in the ever-controversial signal-to-noise ratio. The upside is that
new people might come to the list and be enlightened further on the
reasonableness of privacy.
And speaking pragmatically, I can't imagine that too many people would take
the time to:         1.  read the docs
        2.  join the mailing list
        3.  post ill-considered messages
(As a side note, if anyone ever has any feedback about security coverage in
Netscape documentation, send it my way.)

@_subject: C'punks on c|net 
I haven't been able to plow through the C'punks mail in a while, so I don't
know if the small news broke that I mentioned this list on TV.
For what it's worth, here's what happened:
At the c|net Awards for Internet Excellence last week, Netscape won for best
server. David Pann (marketing), Mike McCool (engineering), and I
(documentation/user interface) accepted on behalf of the company. We each
got a chance to make acceptance speeches. (It was tres Academy Awards.) My
speech was as follows:
"I'll keep this short. I'd like to thank the Cypherpunks for their eternal
Which was received by the audience with a collective gasp.
The live event was simulcast on the Web, and the TV version was shown over
the weekend on the TV show "c|net Central."
