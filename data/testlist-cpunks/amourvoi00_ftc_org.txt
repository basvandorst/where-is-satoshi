Ill show you what ive been working on soon- theyre presents and i have to give them away first have a nice monday
cate did you love disney games on the computer when you were five
me um we didnt have disney games when i was five
one of my resolutions for 2009 was to stop ignoring the etsy shop and to not spin my wheels all day (these two problems are very related) i am the queen of walking in circles around the house and not really getting anything accomplished i wouldnt care except for that it drives me nuts part of the problem is my insomniatic nights which leave me only half there during the day times ( which then leads to high caffeine consumption) so i decided step one is to get good nights sleeps i am trying to change my night time routine to a peaceful herbal tea quiet inspiration seeking few hours it helps if i keep our room clean and the sheets freshly washed and calming reading more- tv less- at night is a goal then hopefully my days will be a little more with it because i hate wasting time
from brora
but the pattern is still available
isnt life surprising i was laying awake thinking last night about how different my life has gone then what i thought (in a good way) and the dishes she cleans for me i dont even have to rinse before putting things in the dishwasher anymore and how warm she keeps my toesies while im sitting at the desk working on the computer who needs slippers it seems her only desire in life is to be close to us and all she asks for is an occasional pet and some food and water truly my lowest maintenance friend
and how every plan ive ever made has been reconstructed into something harder and better than what i laid out as my own agenda i was born in orange county where my parents had lived in the same house for like 20 years they had both lived in so cal all their lives refined sugar will be your enemy till you die
off to the kindergarten valentines day party
i am given glimpses of the why and the good and the reasons and the plan the bigger picture and the necessity for some to not fit the mold
but the main thing i love about this picture is tree cover you can see in the upper right corner thats how it was all around the block even on really hot days you could find a great place to play in some serious shade everyone had a huge tree or trees somewhere on their property and bushes and ivy and a great variety of things the only reason we had those young trees on the corner was because my mom sold our big palm tree to some palm springs landscapers ha
and as ive been laying in my misery ive been thinking a lot about that penny and just how lonely id be if she wasnt there with me i spent a few years calming down my teen angst and attempting to grow up i loved san luis obispo i was ready to chill there for good
