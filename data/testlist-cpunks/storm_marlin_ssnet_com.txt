Same here.  Except a bit of money I earned working in a video store, most
every dollar I've gotten since 1981 has been from the Feds, directly or
indirectly (FDIC, U.S.P.S., and gov't contractors).  As a software
engineer, the U.S. government is too large a market to ignore.
I just look at it as my personal program of wealth re-distribution.  Every
dollar that goes to me (for value well received, I might add) is one that
won't go to bolster rewards for imcompetency and laziness.

@_subject: It works. 
I got PGP because of the comments by Freeh and I wanted to start 'showing
the flag'.  It was inconveniet doing it right while using reading mail/news
on-line so I settled for just adding the "PGP key available" to my sig.
Then along comes Eric with the idea of signing the posts to cypherpunks.
All right, it's a good idea so I'll spend the time necessary to set up
PGP support with the off-line reader called YARN.  Now, been there done that.
Funny thing is, last night I actually had a valid reason to send something
that I wanted to make sure didn't get read along the way ($ involved).  I
had all the pieces, they were in place, they worked.  And due to time
constraints, I wouldn't have been able to do it, if everything hadn't
been ready.
So, thanks Eric.

This brings up a question:  I've been thinking about offering to give
talks to some of the local groups about computer security, privacy,
and encryption, with emphasis on PGP.
Myself not being the most knowlegable on this list and never wanting
to re-invent a working wheel, Has anyone developed a 60 to 90 minute
presentation outline they'd like to share with the list?

I'm read the entire DES specification, which, by the way says that DES
can ONLY be done in hardward, and there is nothing in it that is classified.
The docs covered the design, theory, and method of DES as well as the
testing procedures and required test set.
None of the docs were marked to prohibit export.

Hey all!
I'm looking for some program recommendation and locations pointers.
Both for MS-dos.
First, a good secure delete program.  These I know exists, which are good?
Second, I don't know if this exists.  I've never heard of one but it should!
I want a program to go through a DOS hard drive and zero out all the unused
sectors.  It would also be nice if it zero'ed the tailing disk block after
the end of a file.

@_subject: "You aren't following the _rules_!" 
There have been some good points made here about leading by example.
And about a little more protection from fraudulent posts.  Though I would not want to see sigs made mandatory for list postings, we should be making more use of digisigs, if for no other reason than to get them in front of more people.
That's the reason I put in the line about fingering for my PGP key.  Not
that I expect people to start sending me cryptomail, but to spread
the word a bit to those who aren't on this list.  And it's worked...
I'm gotten several questions about what it means and why I use it.
So, in that light, I'll also start signing my email and posts.  I'll
admit, though, I also use and off-line reader, so it's simple for me.
But the reason I'm off-line is the responses I got from this list
when I asked about key management.
And I'm NOT saying everyone should.  That's a personal decision and
depends on many things, work environment, system speed, personal preferance.
I'm just saying I will.
That's my $200.00 worth.  (Why yes, I do government contracting.  How could you tell?)

I would think that MIME support would be extremely important to some
of the overall goals of the remailer net, i.e. popularity and off-shore
remailers.  Now, I'm not that familiar with MIME, but I believe it
has much better support (that is, it has some) for the extended character
sets that are needed for many languages.
The remailers as the stand today, are great as long as you don't want
to send a message in Chinese, Russian, etc.
As far as RFCs, I think documenting the current remailer system then
the new version is a good idea.  The current system can be done now,
done faster, and provide a better understanding for others who can
then add to the discussion for the next version.

Interesting point, there.
Following from that:

        Telecoms have lawyers.
        Telecoms are the 'transmission' agents for pretty much all of
                the internet. Even high speed dedicated T1s are usually
                from a telecom or two.
Can we get them involved?

Plus the processing cost would place a tremendous burden on the 'net.
Transmision goes both ways, not just from the posting machine to the
rest of the world.  Every site 'transmits' every piece of news posted
to the newsgroups they carry.  Every intermediate site, especially
the backbones, 'transmits' email even in not generated from or
addressed to that site.

I'm joining this a bit late, but if you take the concept
proposed earlier about sticking a remailer stamp on each
encrypted envelope and that stamp being removed by the
remailer, each remailer will get paid for handling the
The anonymity (assuming an FV-type postage sale) can be
restored by having one or more trusted postage exchanges.
You buy a hundred stamps, send them to the exchange, and
get back ninety-nine stamps from a pool.  You now have a
valid remailer stamp that does not have a link to you.
Of course, to keep the purchasers honest, the stamps should
probably be send from the purchase point (FV in this example).
And there would also have to be a fast clearing house so
stamps can't be reused/copies.

Again in the vein of simple to implement...you could set up several
ghost machines that don't really exist but look as if they where
connected to the IP machine through uucp.  I'm not really sure what
the From: address would look like, but it should be easy to generate.
If this was workable, you could create x ghost machines and randomly
pick a From: for each message.  True, the Inet box would be ID'ed,
but as a transmission agent, not an originator.
As I said, I don't know how uucp and Internet mix today, my e-mail
address used to say {...}!uunet!reign!storm.

@_subject: Starting a remailer 
I'm going to be along to set up a remailer shortly.
Two questions:
Since I've only limited bucks but have certain needs, can I get a
package deal on a remailer shell account and the MX service?  What
I'd like is to have all mail to xxxx at myname.com to be forwarded to
my shell account no matter what xxxx is.  Preserving the xxxx, though.
Given the goal of limiting remailer liability, what about having
them be anonymous?  Instead of send you a check, send an unidentified
money order.  This would even allow ownership to change on a frequent
basis without the system owner knowing who the current operator is.
Thoughts?  Comments?  Offers to send cute girls?

Heard on the news today that they arrested a plumber and are holding
him in lieu of $50,000 bail.
He used a PC to crack into the phone system and set up 'Ultra' call
forwarding which forwarded calls to other plumbers businesses to his.
He then took the calls and told the callers that his company was
covering for the one they actually called.
Personal opinion: while I think the guy did steal business from the
other firms, they authorities are trying to find the customers he
'defrauded'.  If they were happy with the work, I don't think they
were actually defrauded.  The other companies did lose income and
I think he should be prosecuted for that, but $50,000 bail seems a
little excessive given the crime.

Minor point: the NCOA data is only available if you have the previous

(severly limited in what they can do) and if there is a match with the
address supplied by the mailer, the address is updated.  You cannot
just call them up and buy mailing lists.
