You are aware that Bidzos is full of shit?
Roger Schafly (sp?) addresses this issue in his lawsuit.  Hopefully this will be resolved soon.  The only problem is that Bidzo has made this claim on patents in other countries, not just USA, so he'd probably have to be sued throughout Europe also...  He sure does do a good job of making himself a pain in the ass even when he knows he's wrong.
Anyway, you could use ElGamal signatures instead, it is not patented.
The D-H and H-M patents do not cover digital signatures.
