Actually, for the feds that isn’t an entirely dumb idea, if their honey traps can’t manage to pretend to be delegates. Being so obviously fake, there’s a good chance that less paranoid delegates might assume she’s just trying to steal hardware from people who aren’t likely to want to report the circumstances (or trying her luck for a soon-to-be rich start-up king), and feel confident enough in their precautions to take that risk for a quick lay. (Of course, as demonstrated by numerous hacks at Blackhats many people aren’t paranoid enough even when they should be alerted to the heightened risk.)

I think such a market would be reasonably safe if the pay-outs were covered by a condition which cancelled the payment if the recipient were determined to be criminally responsible for the death (in which case the money would otherwise be seized as proceeds of crime anyway, so the bookmakers might as well try to claim the money back rather than let the treasury have it). However, I think the operators would probably run into difficulties with either the bookmaking laws or the life-insurance laws.
It is also very difficult to get a court to rule that something is legal before you get prosecuted or sued for doing it, which, given the complexity of our legal systems, seems like a fairly significant flaw. Test cases provide some protection in civil matters, but there isn’t really a practical analogue in criminal matters.

References: IANAL, but the use of a semi-colon rather than a comma would seem to suggest that the except for treason, felony, etc. doesn’t apply to the speech or debate clause, so all matters of speech or debate can only be tried by that house (although what court-like powers the house would have would be an interesting legal problem - I’d say that the framers intended it to be reasonably extensive, since that was (and is) the case in Britain, but one could also argue that it only applies to enforcing the standing orders as written).
Gravell suggests that publishing an excerpt from the official records isn’t protected by the speech or debate clause, so although reading documents into the public record would be useful (since it would give us all legitimate access), it wouldn’t help subsequent publishers.

I must have misunderstood the reports of the part involving Beacon Press, since  the documents published there were the same ones as he had placed in the records of the committee. On reflection, ISTM that the mistake Gravel and Beacon made was that Gravel had obtained it as classified material, and so couldn’t publish it until it was declassified, even though anyone else could have obtained identical documents as an open matter of public record. (A similar quirk affects people who read the Snowdon documents in that the handling rules still apply even though the documents have been published openly, which also makes the mistake of confirming the authenticity of at least some of the documents.) For any lawyers out there - do state legislatures have an equivalent of parliamentary privilege, and if so does it protect state legislators from federal law? I know in Australia they do, but there parliamentary privilege mostly relates to defamation law rather than official secrets (and that’s a matter of state law).

In many ways psuedonymity is easier, but it does increase the importance of being very careful to avoid giving out revealing information. Over time, small details which are easily leaked (either explicitly, or through unintentional references to local facts, events, and jargon, areas of interest, personal details hinting at age, gender, etc., and so on), can build up into enough detail to identify a person down to a very few people, at least for those with the resources and inclination to make such an attempt.
One strategy I have heard of to mitigate that risk is creating a deliberately false persona, one which lives in the same city but in totally different circumstances (changing their family relationships, type of house, etc.), and adjusting tehri comments to fit that, which reduces the risk of accidental disclosure but requires more effort than ordinary psuedonymity.

That varies from corp to corp - pure ISPs (as opposed to companies which are also involved in other areas of the media business), for example, are generally quite strongly opposed to filtering, wiretap and data retention laws, because they are a significant cost to them which makes their core product no better for their customers (and will often make things worse), without any useful benefit to them. Sure, they are only really interested in their own advantage, but their advantage coincides with the desires of privacy advocates, so an alliance of convenience is suitable.
OTOH, in the US many ISPs are also either content producers, TV companies, or POTS companies, and so have a strong interest in preventing their internet activities from harming those (often more profitable) areas of their business. Because they are themselves often beneficiaries of attempts to preserve traditional distribution channels and business methods, they are strong advocates for anti-privacy measures which they believe (rightly or wrongly) will help them while shifting any opposition onto the politicians.
Also, some companies have the sense to realise that even if handing over customer data is no great burden now, the demands from governments only tend to grow, and so opposing a small amount of snooping can protect themselves against a larger imposition later. (For example, the telephone companies at first only had to turn over data they were keeping anyway, then they were ordered to keep it at their own expense for government use.)

The fundamental problem is that we need to protect the anonymity of the common people supporting minority views, and keep public the rich and powerful’s lobbying and campaign contributions (and avoid having them simply filter money through others to hide their actions).

References: Do you have a citation for those cases? I’m not doubting you, but the legal sophistry to argue that an ex post facto law was constitutional despite the explicit prohibition would be interesting. I’ve heard of cases where higher penalties were applied than existed at the time (which IIRC is banned by the ECHR and possibly the CCPR, although is allowed in the USA and elsewhere), or where statutes of limitations were extended, but a blatant ex post facto law seems surprising.

References: Retroactive acquittal is relatively OK - it is a good thing when applied to the people, for example people have been campaigning for a long time to get all British sodomy convictions quashed even though everyone has now been released, so we more or less have to accept that it *can* be used to clear government agents too, even if politically we shouldn’t approve (at least in specific cases). (For criminal matters, in many jurisdictions the government can simply refuse to prosecute cases against its agents and private prosecutions aren’t permitted in some places, so it doesn’t create any new danger to the public.)
Retroactive indictment is the problem, and is far more dangerous.

While unfortunate for Litecoin’s users, that does demonstrate a nice benefit of crypto currencies for the public cryptography community - it gives a direct financial benefit to ordinary people working on attacking cryptography, and their discoveries will be much more likely to leak than government cryptographers.

Obvious solutions:
* declare BTC to be presumptively evidence of drug dealing or trading CP - possession of weakly-related artefacts being declared as sufficient evidence has, IIRC, been ruled legal in NY in the case of a law which made possession by a woman of multiple condoms evidence of prostitution.
* require BTC holdings to be declared to the tax authorities, and make explicit that whatever the local tax on investment holdings applies to BTC (I think the current question is not whether growth in value of BTC is taxable but what kind of investment it should be taxed as).
* snarl up BTC exchanges with the same reporting requirements as normal banks and trading houses, even though the much smaller scale will make that extremely difficult to comply with.
* rule that BTC miners are engaging in banking by building up the record in the block chain, and make them all responsible for reporting the transactions they process
Apart from the first, none of those would be very controversial, or even entirely without merit if you accept the validity of the anti-fraud, anti-money-laundering, and anti-tax-evasion laws which require reporting by financial services companies. The trouble is, what is a tolerable imposition on a company handling millions of dollars is a huge and crippling burden on some guy with a couple of hundred dollars worth of BTC. (This is where a “by way of trade” qualifier[0] would come in useful, but it would also be horribly exploitable when it comes to financial trading.)

 seems to be an attempt to do something like that, but there are two catches:
* CACert association membership is by nomination by pre-existing members, rather than being everyone with a certificate (or, perhaps more practically, open to everyone with a certificate).
* It hasn’t complied with the CA/Browser Forum rules, so isn’t included in any of the four main browser certificate lists.
I’m not sure how professional their operation is either: their class 1 certificates are issued robotically (although that doesn’t make them any worse than some for-profit CAs), and I haven’t actually looked into the verification they offer for class 3 certs.
