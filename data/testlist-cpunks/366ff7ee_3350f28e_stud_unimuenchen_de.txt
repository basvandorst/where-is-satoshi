@_subject: strange posts 
I obtained a bunch of totally EMPTY posts from
      owner-cypherpunks at Algebra.COM
in intervals of about half an hour. Does anyone have the same
experience and know what's the matter? (Further it appears that
a couple of posts of mine have been delayed and have not yet appreared
after the usual waiting time.)
