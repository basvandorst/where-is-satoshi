Could the U.S. Government Start Reading Your Emails?
A new security research project is designed to scan millions of IMs, texts and emails every day.

Cherie Anderson runs a travel company in southern California, and she's convinced the federal government is reading her emails. But she's all right with that.
"I assume it's part of the Patriot Act and I really don't mind," she says. "I figure I'm probably boring them to death."
It's likely Anderson is not alone in her concerns that the government may be monitoring what Americans say, write, and read. And now there may be even more to worry about: a newly revealed security research project called PRODIGAL -- the Proactive Discovery of Insider Threats Using Graph Analysis and Learning -- which has been built to scan IMs, texts and emails . . . and can read approximately a quarter billion of them a day.

"Every time someone logs on or off, sends an email or text, touches a file or plugs in a USB key, these records are collected within the organization," David Bader, a professor at the Georgia Tech School of Computational Science and Engineering and a principal investigator on the project, told FoxNews.com.
PRODIGAL scans those records for behavior -- emails to unusual recipients, certain words cropping up, files transferred from unexpected servers -- that changes over time as an employee "goes rogue." The system was developed at Georgia Tech in conjunction with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Army's secretive research arm that works on everything from flying cars to robotic exoskeletons.

Initially, PRODIGAL will scan only the communications of military volunteers and people who work in federal agencies. But the very existence of such a project is sure to unnerve citizens like Anderson. Is the government reading my emails? Are they already monitoring me?
"Some people say it's one step further toward a police state," said Anthony Howard, a book author and security expert who has consulted for the Department of Homeland Security.
But Bader and other experts are quick to dismiss the idea that PRODIGAL could be used to monitor everyone in America. The scans work only on internal systems, they say -- not across the entire Internet. And the experts say such a project is long overdue: by monitoring for "anomalies" and predicting extreme behavior, catastrophes can be prevented, such as a soldier in good mental health becoming homicidal or a government employee sharing key classified information.
ANALYSIS: Is the Internet Destroying Privacy?
"Today, an analyst may receive tens of thousands of 'anomalies' per day, where an anomaly is an unexplained event," Bader said.
The new system is designed to aid analysts in processing those anomalies. And it's not alone.
Bader equated the PRODIGAL system to Raytheon SureView, an internal scanning system that looks for suspicious activity and alerts federal agencies about possible threats. Another system is the Einstein project, which was developed after 9/11 and scans government employees for key words and links suspicious activity to National Security Agency databases.
But PRODIGAL scans vastly more data than those systems: as much as a terabyte or more per day, what Georgia Tech described as "massive data sets."
PRODIGAL is part of an existing DARPA security project called Anomaly Detection at Multiple Scales (ADAMS), which was announced earlier this year. Details about how ADAMS works are not widely known; Georgia Tech's recent announcement is one of the first reports to explain how these detection engines work.
According to Bader, PRODIGAL uses complex "graph-processing" algorithms to analyze threats and piece together a jigsaw puzzle of communications. The system then ranks the unusual activity before feeding the most suspicious threats to agents.
Cyber-security expert Joseph Steinberg, CEO of Green Armor Solutions, said ADAMS is unique in that it scans through a massive stream of data. He says the new project, which will take about two years to develop and will cost $9 million, will be more effective at analyzing threats and determining if they are valid.
But the issue is not the scanning technology itself; it's how the information is interpreted -- and whether it ultimately helps at all, Howard told FoxNews.com.
"Since there is no real data publicly available to substantiate that any of this technology is preventing terrorist attacks or strengthening our borders from within, [we can't] really say definitively that this technology is doing any good," he said.
The challenge, he said, is that criminals and terrorists often use multiple channels of communication, some encrypted -- and know how to avoid existing detection systems.
Nevertheless, PRODIGAL's ability to scan reams of data is clearly the next step in tracking unusual activity, and it's guaranteed to raise a red flag for Anderson and others.
"Since people tend to be imperfect, the data captured can easily be mishandled. Where does it end?" Howard said.

@_subject: [liberationtech] Kazakhstan 
Some members of this list may have seen news of the government crackdown in Kazakhstan. Excerpt from the HRW report:
"The government has apparently shut down access to at least some mobile, voice, and text services in Zhanaozen. By late afternoon, Human Rights Watch could no longer reach workers by mobile phone, and access to Twitter.com and other news sites reporting on the unrest had been blocked by the authorities. bWithout a means to communicate with the outside world, people in Zhanaozen are extremely vulnerable,b Rittmann said."
Is anybody aware of efforts to set up dial-up access, satellite internet access, ad hoc radio or wireless networks  or anything for Kazakhstan? I'm hearing rumors (unconfirmed) that shutdown of Internet and some mobile services may extend beyond Zhanaozen. If anybody is aware of any efforts underway please let me know either on or off-list. I know some people who may be interested in supporting such efforts but they don't know who to approach.

Some observations on the Great Firewall of China
Suddenly, without any warning:
Aug  8 02:04:32 neolith1 sshd[12862]: Bad protocol version identification 'jN\321\203\267\237\317a-\310VS9\305\343\242\230\370\232W\255\224c\223\021\251\001\230 \335\256\315\037\374\367\347`\312\tI\037\024__~\363i\031\b8P\262\247\002s\322\324\177\022\27430v\020\313\030\253\346\312\001\301c\002&-r*\350\037i\241\335\274\316\364S]\035%\242\332\262\037\270xiO\243P\230' from 58.144.66.30
Say what?
Aug 20 05:57:34 neolith1 sshd[14803]: Bad protocol version identification 'E\253l\233\242\243R\246\356 from 123.184.190.106
I work as a security officer at the National Supercomputer Centre at Linkvping University. It is my job to be paranoid.
I pay a lot of attention to our ssh logs. We have something like fifty thousand ssh logins per day, and anywhere up to half a million failed login attempts. I don't like seeing things in my logs that I don't understand. It makes me twitch.
I certainly didn't understand those log entries that suddenly started appearing. From out of the blue, Chinese IP addresses would connect to the ssh port on one of our systems and throw what looked like random bytes at it. Each address would connect just once. We had never seen those IP addresses before, and they would go away again, never to return.
The plot thickens: Moreover, it seemed that nobody had seen these addresses in any relevant context. I checked all of my usual sources for information on botnets, on ssh brute-force scanners, on machines exhibiting a generalized anti-social behaviour. Nothing. These addresses were clean. Nobody had seen so much as an insulting blog post comment from them.
I started discreetly contacting colleagues at other sites, to check if they saw anything similar. Again, nothing. Oh, sometimes people would see some "Bad protocol version identification" messages, but on closer look there was always some simple explanation. Perhaps somebody had ran an nmap or Nessus scan against them - these scans are easily recognizable. Sometimes, somebody was scanning for open http proxies. But this stuff? Nope.
Except, a few select colleagues did see the same thing. Chinese addresses, making one-shot connections to port 22 on a small number of target systems, sending pseudo-random binary data. To this date, I am aware of four sites around the world that have received these probes. In all reason, there must be more targetted sites, but I haven't found them.
This really made my admin senses tingle. Were we compromised? Were these weird payloads triggers for some kind of backdoor on our system? I will spare you the details, but the level of scrutiny I subjected the system to was, well, scrutinous. I found nothing. Unfortunately, this didn't necessarily mean that we weren't compromised. It might just mean that I hadn't looked hard enough. So I looked some more. Once again, nothing.
We captured some of the probe payloads in full. I could see no pattern in the data, no kind of protocol that I could recognize. Was this some kind of 0day sshd exploit? I threw the data at a carefully monitored sshd process, to see if it would trigger some unexpected code path. Nothing.
Eureka: Then, almost a year after I saw that first probe, I was looking at the log data from yet another angle to try to figure this out, and I finally saw the pattern. Epiphany. I felt like a genius, and at the same time like the world's greatest idiot.
The blindingly obvious thing I had been missing for a year was that each and every one of these probes was followed after 5-20 seconds by an ssh login attempt from China, and the attempts were mostly successful and apparently legitimate. The legitimate logins came from somewhere completely else, but still in China.
What can I say? We have lots of Chinese users. We have lots of logins from China, nothing strange about that. In our systems, 5-20 seconds means several pages of log data to scroll through. Still, I should have caught this much faster.
My colleagues at the other targetted sites confirmed my observations. Once they knew what to look for, they saw the same thing. My only consolation is that those very clever people also hadn't found this correlation.
So, to more precisely describe what we have found: a small subset of the ssh logins from Chinese IPs to two of our systems are preceded by one or two connections from unrelated Chinese IP addresses, in which opaque binary data is thrown at sshd. These addresses come from all over China, from all sorts of networks.
I see no particular pattern in which users are targetted, or what IP addresses they log in from and I see no pattern or structure in the opaque data, except for the following:
For a few weeks around May/June 2011, the probe payloads actually looked like SSL handshakes,
We see lots and lots of ssh brute-force attacks from Chinese IP addresses. However, these ssh login attempts do not appear to trigger any probes.
So, what is this all about? Well, I have a theory.
Conjecture: This is the Great Firewall of China, working to protect its citizens from unlawful foreign influences.
My hypothesis is that just over a year ago, a new function in the firewall went into limited beta test, where a sample of outgoing ssh connections from China is carefully selected for secondary screening.
I don't know what the selection criteria are, but apparently the probing only involves certain Chinese source networks (hence the lack of probes in connection to brute-force attacks) and certain target hosts.
For the selected ssh connections, the target system is probed from one or two IP addresses under the control of the Chinese government. These may be otherwise innocent addresses that are spoofed at the level of the great firewall, or they may be actual computers under remote control by the government - I have no way to tell.
I don't know what the probes are supposed to accomplish. My only guess is that the government is looking for certain services it doesn't approve of, like open proxies or Tor relays, and that precise fingerprinting may be too expensive. Instead, they resort to an inspection method similar to fuzzing, where pseudo-random data is thrown at the server, just to see what happens.
In some cases, the legitimate ssh connections are unsuccessful; they appear to be interrupted. This may be a result of the firewall deciding the target system to be unsuitable and injecting RST packets into the TCP stream to kill it.
The last few weeks, the frequency of the probing has increased. This might mean the beta test period is nearing its end, and that this function is about to become more widely deployed.
Conclusion: I do believe my theory above is more or less correct. I have no way to prove it, but it does fit all observed facts (including some which I am unable to disclose), and I have no tenable alternative explanations. It also matches the known repulsive censorship the Chinese government subjects its citizens to. I strongly dislike this probing of our systems that the Chinese government appears to be performing.
Of course, I may be mistaken. Any feedback or alternative explanations are welcome. You can reach me at nixon at nsc.liu.se.
