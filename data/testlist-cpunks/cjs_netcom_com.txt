Its legal until someone makes some money at it. Soon as someone makes
enough to notice, then you can bet that the FBI/IRS/Dept. of
Agriculture (responsible for weights and measures in many locals) and
the local lottery commission are all going to come and take a piece of
the action.
Having a gamebling establishment is something that, in America, is
reserved as a privleadge solely for the capitalist elite. If you don't
have a big-ass bankroll and a rolodez full of connections to begin
with, you can expect to find your ass in jail and your posessions on
the auction block just as soon as someone takes notice of you.
But thanks to the InterNet, thats all changed. =)
I for one would be happy to pay all applicatable income taxes to any
government that would allow me to host gambeling via the net and
promise not to throw me in jail for making too much money too fast or
not following some outdated work ethic. Of course, you still run the
risk that you might wake up one night to find yourself sourrounded by
Navy seals and assult copters, or that congress will mandate a
national firewall on your site or something equally extream, but not
unless you are really living the good life.

@_subject: [NOISE] Caution! Netscape 2.0 and Linux 
Hi all.
Just a warning to steer clear of Netscape 2.0 on Linux. It can't
resolve FQDNs, its distributed as a staticly linked a.out binary
*AGAIN*, and I'm hearing lots of reports sitting here on IRC that it
locks up R6 versions of XFree solid on a random basis. Not to mention
that there is no java support yet for Linux, and the Java support in
the Sun/Windows version of netscape is based on the new (and
imcompatible with earlier versions) beta version of Java which sun
pimped out to Netscape and won't release the source code too.
The part about not resolving FQDNs might be an undocumented
feature. The most secure transaction is one that doesn't take place at
all. ;)
Have fun,

@_subject: [NOISE] Caution! Netscape 2.0 and Linux 
Releaseing an a.out binary without motif staticly linked is a dumb
idea. There were approximately a dozen vendors of Motif for Linux,
however none of their libraries were compatible as they could not
afree on where the library should reside in memory and how much space
to allocate for future additions to the libraries.
Thats why the linux developers switched to ELF format binaries. Under
ELF all symbol names are resolved at run-time so one man's motif will
work just fine for everyone elf. Normally I would suggest that someone should drop the good people at
netscape a hint that you can link Motif staticly without linking all
of the X11 libraries staticly as well, except they are still producing
a.out bins and since nobody has a.out libraries any more, making one
dynamicly linked wouldn't do anyone any good.
I said it first, but you said it better. Netscape uses the Beta Java
stuff, which is totally incomptible with the Alpha Java stuff. Nobody
has the Beta java stuff except for Netscape because sun is refusing to
release it to anyone else for the moment -- that means you can't get
it at sun's site.

Yeah. Thats the way it works sometimes. I remember back when that

@_subject: Netscape for Linux? 
I'll say some people are happy about it. You just recently turned down an order for 230 copies of the netscape
navigator for Linux, and as you folks aren't making any money, you can
only wonder why.
You have also turned numerous other attempts by varionus people to buy
both quantities of navigaors and server software for Linux.
It seems to me that you folks are going out of your way to deny the
fact that the Linux market exists. I think that its because you are
embarassed that all these people with a $20 operating system are
throwing money at you while all the folks with $10K operating systems
aren't talking to you at all. While you may WANT to have all your sales be for OSF/1 machines or
solaris, but refusing to support Linux and ignoring the demand for
your products by the Linux community just because you don't think it
would sound as impressive, is actually quite childish and doesn't make
any financial sense.

Hello all.
Someone mentioned this on IRC last night, and it sounded like a really
cool idea, so I thought I'd mention it.
The idea is to generate random numbers using a geiger counter tube and
a small portion of radioactive substance (like perhaps the stuff they
use in smoke detectors?) Would that be random enough?
I thought it was a neat idea anyway.

I'm a little new to this, but I thought the whole idea behind keys was
not having to whisper "secrets" to someone on the other side of a
crowded mall. Most people don't have the luxary of connecting their
computers back to back with someone on the other side of the world
just to ensure a secure communications path. Ther would have to be
some mechnisms to ensure that secure delivery of your "secret", and
that brings us back to key management, so the whole thing is rather
self defeating.

@_subject: Whoa there, speederpunks! WAS: Police prepair stunning end.. 
Whoa there, speederpunks!
I've let a couple of these messages go past me without comment, but I
think I'd like to throw in a couple cents on this one.
1) I'd like to assure y'all, as someone who has had a run in with a
   couple bad alternators, that loosing electrical power will not    cause you to go careening off the side of the road.
   Granted, you might be a in fix if your a nine year old kid running
   from the cops in a '64 volvo, or some other arian super-car, and the
   power steering went out. But if that were to ever happen, it would be
   because you ran over a few curbs at ludicrus speed -- not because
   Johnny Flatfoot hosed ya down with an EM cannon.
2) Someone was curious why they don't just throw some high voltage
   cables across road and wait for the fire works. Well, this is a
   no-brainer too. In order for that to work, you sorta have to get me
   to do two things 1) drive down your street and 2) drive over your
   wires. Assuming that I have a reson for not being caught, I might
   not be too cooperative at doing that either. And of course the last
   consideration is that the guy putting down the wires might not get
   out of the way fast enough -- y'all come down to texas and ask the
   armadillo's why thats a problem.
3) It is really pointless to bicker about this. To quote from a not so
   popular Mark Hamel flick, "Radio, kid. Faster then rubber." Use the
   force, luke.
4) I would think that y'all would be happy that someone is doing all
   the tough work of constructing these devices. I think we all know
   that the first space cadet to haul one of these things into Kabrini
   Park is gonna loose it. From there its just a matter of time until
   every speed racer has one of these "inventions" mounted on his car
   and junior is wanting to order one from the 'Amazing Devices' ad in
   the back of Popular Science (in fact, I think you already can).
   From there, I think that a practical and portable EM cannon could
   become the HOT urban warfare weapon of the next decade. Bonnie and
   Clyde are going to look like amateurs when any rank and file with a
   mortage can buzz the bank and take them off-line for a day. Not to
   mention what you could do to a hospital, police station, air plane,
   traffic signal, grocery store, U-FO, and anything else that uses 1s    and 0s. All safely and anonymously I might add -- a concealed EM    cannon isn't gonna draw any attention, even when you fire it.
Thats my two cents,
Bye y'all.

I think that a lot of what the freedom hacker was trying to say got
lost due to some of the pictures he included. His alterations to the
battered women's page are not going to win him any points with me or
anyone else. Nor is his "Kill the Nigs" version of clinton's

our diminishing rights. In fact, the whole thing is more likely to
backfire then it is to do any good.
So Mr. Freedom Hacker, wherever you are out there, if you ever get a
chance to do it again, here is a little advice to you. 1) pick a
single point or common theme. 2) do not alienate 60% of your audience
in the process 3) try to be more professional and 4) let whoever did

@_subject: CDA; Don't get mad, get even! 
I think that we should make an example of those responsible for the
CDA. Ignorance is really not an excuse here, because whoever voted for
for the bill should have known the CDA was attached to it, and should
have had some idea of what it did.
Lets get a list of whos supporting this thing and bad press them back
before the dawn of time. We need to make these people hosehold names
so that people know not to vote for them again. We need to make sure
people understand that e-mail = postal mail, that these folks just
voted to let the government censor their mail, and that they knew what
they were doing. We should also make lists of great works of art and
literatre which are technicly illegal to transmit, we should dig up
some dirt on these people to show that they are definitly not 'holier
then thou', and if the CDA actually goes into effect, a few horror
stories of good christian couples (young) having their lives ruined
and their names draged through the mud for talking dirty on the phone
or sending a suggestive e-mail to each other would be good propaganda
And on other fronts, we should make things as difficult as possible
for our government to passively monitor us. Even the simpliest
encryption, nothing more exotic then Xor'ing information by a bitmask
(32 bits or so), will be more then enough to render those tera-cycle
packet-sniffers pretty-much useless. I would love to see sendmail
itself modified to use SSL when available.

Mach != Linux. When people use use this thing, they will *not* be
using Linux in any way shape of form. The drivers and such that you
develop will be completely worthless to Linux proper without someone
spending months to port them, and advances in Linux such as the new
page cache or the upcoming revision of ext2fs may not show themselves
on your "linux" for an equal period of time.
This comes back to my belief that you folks are just trying to cash in
on Linux's name and reputation without contributing something directly
to the cause. Why didn;t you just call it it "OSF/1 for PowerMac" and
include an ext2fs server? Hindsight? Why don't you just port Linux
proper to PowerMac? (and how did this get on cypherpunks?)

card on a computer could possibly get that person's credit card
number. A spokesperson for RNI Labs said, "Wow man! This is like an
incredible discovery, man. If you can like see someone entering their
card number then you can like look at what keys they push and like get
their number and like charge stuff to them. There is like no hardware
or software on earth that can like prevent it." The spokesperson went
on to say that the reprocussions of their discovery could lead to
world-wide economic chaos, a rebirth of the third reich, and the 27th
coming of Jesus Christ.
