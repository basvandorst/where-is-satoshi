Sounds like you were referring to me.  I've been doing some perl
programming and have scripts to create an address block, encode a
message for transmittal with an address block, and to process one hop
of a message.  These scripts don't actually do any encryption, but
rather simulate it for testing purposes.  They're not ready for use
mailing actual messages, and I still have to finish the script for
decoding the message when it's finally recieved.  So, there's a bunch
of work to go, but it looks good so far.  I'll be sure to let everyone
know when they're in a condition to be played with by all.

@_subject: REMAIL: Virtual remailers 
Hal:  you should definitely keep your caltech remailer up, and
forwarding it to portal will not destroy its usefulness.  Remember
that a primary function of the remailers is to obscure the sender of a
message.  A message that passed through both caltech and portal would
require collecting logs from both systems to trace back beyond that
point.  That can't be easier than collecting the logs from only one of
the systems.

@_subject: Solicitation of Tax Evasion--An Example 
The example given (someone soliciting an act of questionable legality)
is a perfect application for the SASE remailer that I've been
developing.  I presented it at a phys-meeting a few months back, and
have been working on coding it sporadically since then.
The idea is that you have an address block that encodes the
information on how to get a message to you.  This is like a self
addressed envelope.  The envelope can specify multiple hops through
remailers, but is encrypted in layers so only the next hop is revealed
at each remailer.
The difficulty comes in allowing the message to be re-encrypted at
each stage (to keep a remailer from recognizing a message it has
passed through itself on an earlier hop), but still allow it to be
reconstructed at the final destination.
The protocol also allows postage stamps to be securely delivered to
each hop along the way, and yet be provided by the sender (who doesn't
know the identity, or public key, of the remailers).
You could use this by paying someone to forward messages to you via
your SASE address.  This way, you can publish an address by which
messages can be sent to you, but without leaving yourself easily
trackable. -eric messick

This is an excellent observation which many people seem to ignore when
thinking about anonymous remailers.  It's understandable why, because
achieving both of these goals at the same time is really quite
difficult.  I've been working on a system to accomplish this for
several months now, and it's quite complicated.  I call it SASE for
Self Addressed Stampable Envelopes.  Actually a new name that doesn't
imply prepaid postage would be nice if anyone can think of a catchy
Samuel> To construct an anonymous address block might be something like:
Samuel> 	Anonymous Anne wants an anonymous address.
Samuel> 	First she generates a set of N keys (IDEA, DES or .......
That's basically the way SASE works.  It's important that some of the
keys be public key pairs, however; as you need to be able to publish
one half of a key, and seal the other half for an unpublished remailer
to decrypt with.
One thing is certain, these protocols are not simple.  We definitely
need people thinking about them...

@_subject: Remailer abuse 
Another suggestion is to invert this:  create a list of addresses that
the remailer WILL send mail to.  But, that's STUPID, you say.  Well,
maybe, but I don't think so.  It is, however, sneaky.  If you run a
remailer, you should be registered with other remailers so they can
use you to forward stuff.  This places you on thier list of OK places
to remail stuff to.  Remailers should exchange these lists to keep
them up to date.  This, of course, encourages people to run remailers,
which is what we want.  It also silences any objections from people
concerning anonymous abuse, since you have to explicitly ask for
anonymous mail by running a remailer.
One problem this doesn't solve is how to send anonymous mail to
someone who hasn't registered, since that's exactly what we're trying
to avoid.  Someone could offer a human remailing service which
moderated the messages it sent through.  Using such a service, you
could request someone to run a remailer.  A cheaper service could just
send a standard message to an address that you send to it.  In all
these cases, the service provider is responsible for the content of
the messages sent out, and consequently would want to be very

@_subject: Remailer Use 
My solution to this has two parts.
Part 1: mixes should refuse to resend mail to anywhere except the owner
of the mix or other (registered with it) mixes.
Part 2: someone should provide a service that sends a standard text
message to an arbitrary address.  The text message should tell the
recipient how to run a mix and register it with the network of mixes.
It will also say that someone wishes to contact them anonymously.
This should help calm people's fears that they might be held
responsible for abusive messages sent through a mix under their
control.  It is hard for someone to complain about receiving an
anonymous message when they had to explicitly run a piece of software
to be able to receive any anonymous messages at all.
The incentive structure for this system encourages people to run mixes
if they want to retain anonymity.  It has an advantage over filters
that keep a list of places to not send to:  it is a positive filtering
scheme, rather than a negative one, and thus should scale better.
The person who runs the standard text sender of part 2 can feel
comfortable being responsible for the messages sent out because they
wrote or approved the text.  They can throttle the service so the
message can only be sent occasionally to any given address, and block
it entirely for anyone who requests it.
For this to work, we need to have an easily installable mix package
that will run on a large variety of machines.  Not easy, but it should
be where we're heading anyway.

@_subject: RemailerNet 
This is an excellent way of getting around this problem, but it uses
lots of bandwidth.  Another idea I have been interested in is picking
a message up from the middle of a chain.  In other words, your return
address block lists 10 remailers (for example), and you just happen to
run the 7th.  After the message hits your remailer, it continues
through a few more hops and then gets eaten by /dev/null.  Your
remailer, meanwhile, has snarfed a copy of ALL of the traffic running
through it to another machine.  There you manually enter parameters to
use to scan for messages to you.  If the feds come to you and demand
that you perform this process while they monitor it, you enter
a different set of parameters that uncover innocent messages that you
arrange to be occasionally passing through.  If they've traced a
message all the way to the end, they'll know it was to one of the 10
remailer operators in the chain, but several of them are in
inconvenient jurisdictions...  and maybe one of these tap-points was
arranged to start another chain.....
Not quite that bad.  Another message would have to be sent only if
there was insufficient postage for one of the remailers, and that
remailer decided to deliver it rather than just dropping it.
Otherwise, all of the info necessary to decode the message is known to
the recipient.
That is certainly true.  I've been trying to figure out how to
subdivide the project so that early implementations can be done
without sacrificing the ability to do the more complex stuff later.
I don't think they can be unconditionally secure without wasting lots
of bandwidth.  Having one of the links be a wide area broadcast is
very secure, but expensive in bandwidth.  It's all economics...

What you've got here is very similar, but you've added a very
interesting slant to it.  The cost of setting up a prepaid mailer (at
least in terms of distributed compute power) appears to be pretty
high,  but the security you gain from it is likely to be worth it for
certain applications.  I'll have to spend some time studying this.
Very interesting indeed...

[This is going to several lists with overlapping memberships.
Apologies if you're recieving this more than once.]
The bashing of Jupiter has begun, and in less than a week it will be
over.  That's certainly a cause for celebration, so you're invited to
join me for a Post Jovial Bash.
Where: A cozy geodesic dome nestled in the Santa Cruz mountains.
Directions are included below.
When: Saturday, July 23, 1994.  The party begins at noon.  Crash space
is available if you wish to stay until Sunday.
What to bring:
Food and/or drink to share and enjoy.  I'd like to encourage people to
bring healthier items: low-fat and/or vegetarian food, juices, etc...
but nothing will be turned away.  A grill will be available, and I
will be providing some food and drinks.  Suggestions and contributions
are welcome.
Musical instruments.
A towel (you do know where it is, don't you?) for enjoying the hot
tub.  It will be clothing optional, but probably not used until it
cools off in the evening.
Bedding if you suspect you might want to spend the night.
And of course, bring interesting people, ideas, and things.
Note to cat allergy sufferers (like me):  6 cats live in the house.
Be prepared.
To print a map and directions, snip off the file below and send it to
any PostScript(tm) printer.  If you haven't got one, you'll have to
make do without the map.  Just read the text at the top of the file
for directions.
