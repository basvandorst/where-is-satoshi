Dear Randall
I saw your post on the cypherpunks list debunking the
forgery of my good friend Phill Zimmerman. As you are
no doubt aware my Deputy Director of the NSA retired
recently and I've decided that Barbie is no longer suitable
following certain uncomplimentary remarks she made
after a fireside shagging^H^H^H^Hchat we had last night.
I am therefore looking for a supersluth to fill this
challenging position. If you would be interested in
taking the bit between your teeth, so to speak, please
email me and we'll do lunch.
Bill C.

U.S. Navy caught hacking
  into British marine
  charity Web site   By Kristi Essick   InfoWorld Electric   Posted at 3:07 PM PT, May 8, 1998   The U.S. Navy has been caught attempting to
  break in to secure areas of a World Wide Web
  site sponsored by a U.K. marine-mammal
  preservation charity, according to officials at the
  organization.   The Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society
  (WDCS) -- which operates an online shopping
  site aimed at generating money for the welfare of
  the animals at  --
  said it was alerted to the attempted break-in last
  week by its site-hosting company, Merchant
  Technology Ltd.   "We were working late one night, and a
  command line request came in wanting to access
  unauthorized areas of the site," said Andy Fisher,
  marketing manager for Merchant. "We were
  amazed to find out it was the Pentagon."   Merchant built and manages the secure
  electronic-commerce site for the conservation
  society and routinely keeps an eye on who visits.
  If users attempt to gain access to unauthorized
  areas, the company is alerted to the source of the
  incoming request.   At 9:45 p.m. GMT on April 28, Fisher said,
  workers at Merchant were shocked to see an
  incoming attempt to breach security by a user
  identified as donhqns1.hq.navy.mil.   Merchant got in touch with WDCS immediately,
  only to find out that the charity had been
  contacted by the Navy a few weeks earlier. The
  Navy was interested in obtaining a report the
  group is working on that details the efforts of
  Russian animal experts to train dolphins in the
  Black Sea for military tasks, such as finding and
  attaching probes to submarines, Fisher said.   A WDCS representative said that there is
  nothing secret about the Russian government's
  activities in this area but that the document does
  contain information about the export of the
  trained dolphins to foreign countries. The group
  declined to give the Navy a copy of the report
  only because it was not complete at the time.
  Once it is made final, the report will be published
  and the Navy can then examine it, the
  representative said.   The WCDS said that it is confused about why the
  Navy would attempt to break in to its Web site.   "I think whoever it was within the U.S. Navy
  facility would have better things to do rather than
  try and hack into our computers," said Chris
  Stroud, the organization's director of campaigns,
  in a statement. "If they were seeking reports on
  the Black Sea, we shall be freely publishing these
  in the near future anyway."   The WCDS previously has commented
  unfavorably on Navy activities such as its
  low-frequency sonar trials off Hawaii and on
  ship collisions with endangered whales, the
  group said.   Merchant says it is "100 percent sure" the
  hacking attempt originated from the Navy.
  WDCS has notified the U.S. Embassy in London
  and the relevant U.K. authorities, the
  organization said.   "We hope that the U.S. authorities have some
  rational explanation for this incident," Stroud
  said.   "The Navy has not yet received a formal
  complaint on the issue," said a Navy official, who
  declined to be named. "Until the Navy receives a
  formal complaint with details, there's not much
  we can do to proceed further."   Merchant Technology Ltd., in Bath, England, can
  be reached at 44 (1225) 481 015. The Whale and
  Dolphin Conservation Society, also in Bath, can
  be reached at 44 (1225) 334 511 or

It wouldn't make any sense. Why would a hacker use a military
site that is actively monitored to hack into a site with less security?
And why the requests to get the document originating from the same
Also, from what I have read, the DoD needs come first in everything,
especially Defence Security related issues. No holds barred when they
want something.
This sounds exactly like the kind of information that they would want and consider essential, and could thus justify themselves to
get it by any means available. Of course, if this was a hacker playing tricks to the US military,
then I'm sure we can expect the military will publish this serious
a security breach, in order to get more money to protect themselves
against any Internet terrorist attacks in the future.
But I bet there will be no public comments or explanation given.

              WASHINGTON, May 9 ï¿½ Agents from the National Security
              Agency will try to break into NASAï¿½s computers to
              whether the space agency can fend off cyber-intruders who
              could threaten launch-control and other critical
operations, the
              trade publication Defense Week reports.

                      Aeronautics and Space Administrationï¿½s
unclassified computer

troublemakers can get
                      to sensitive data and what NASAï¿½s doing about it.
                             Teams from the intelligence agency will
soon try to
                      penetrate NASA networks in up to eight states,
said the
                      newsletter in the edition to be published Monday.
                             Last June, NSA ï¿½hackersï¿½ showed they could

                             The NASA ï¿½penetration study,ï¿½ which will be

out because
                      it involves a U.S. civilian agency, and such
operations are
                      barred by the 1952 law that created NSA, the
newsletter said.                              However, the law barring domestic
activities contains an
                      exception if the spy agency is invited to do the
                             Still, the publication said the planned
test raised questions of
                      privacy.
                             John Pike of the Federation of American
Scientists, a
                      veteran observer of both NASA and the intelligence
                      community, told the newsletter that the NASA test
breaks new
                      ground and bears close watching.
                             ï¿½This is the next big step in NSAï¿½s
expanding role in
                      domestic information security,ï¿½ he said. ï¿½Itï¿½s
certainly the first
                      reported major initiative of this sort with
respect to a
                      non-military agency. While a number of safeguards
are in
                      place, there are concerns about the potential for
abuse of this
                      type of activity.ï¿½
                             But Charles Redmond, the space agencyï¿½s
manager of
                      information-technology security, said the test was
ï¿½not an
                      invasion of privacy.ï¿½
                             NASA preferred to have the intelligence
agency do the
                      tests because it wanted to protect security and
proprietary data
                      and to avoid any conflict of interest, Redmond
                             The tests will determine how easy it is to
access sensitive

C A P E   C A N A V E R A L,  Fla.,  May 8 ï¿½ A
                         secret spy satellite blasted off on
                         Friday atop the U.S. military's most
                         powerful rocket booster.                               The 20-story U.S. Air Force Titan 4B
                         rocket, carrying the classified National
                         Reconnaissance Office spacecraft, lifted off
                         Cape Canaveral launch pad at 9:38 p.m. EST.
                              The rocket's comet-like streak through the
                         moon-lit night sky was visible as far away as
                         Orlando.
                              According to the trade journal Aviation
                         Week and Space Technology, the Titan, built by
                         Lockheed Martin Corp., placed an electronic
                         eavesdropping satellite into orbit.
                              "It will be used to listen in on
                         communications in hostile areas, such as the
                         Middle East and North Korea," said Craig
                         Covault, the magazine's space technology
                         editor.
                              The rocket soared into the sky several
                         late after a problem-plagued countdown. Air
                         Force launch controllers had to deal with
                         technical trouble at a tracking station and
                         upper-level winds.
                              The countdown was also disrupted by a
                         container ship and a small sail boat that
                         into the launch danger area in the Atlantic
                         Ocean, east of Cape Canaveral.
