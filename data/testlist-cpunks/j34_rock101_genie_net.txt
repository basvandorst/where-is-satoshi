the workers to protect their immediate interests against the
 employers.
         In addition to organizing industrially, the workers will need
 a political party to spread the idea of social ownership, and to gain
 the supprt of the majority at the polls.  When this is achieved, the
 workers will assume control of their workplaces, and manage them
 democratically through their New Unions.  An elected Congress of
 delegates from each industry will plan and manage the national
 economy, and will replace the present political Congress as the
 nation's government.
