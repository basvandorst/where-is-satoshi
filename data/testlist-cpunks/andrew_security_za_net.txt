Unfortunatly DDOS Attacks seem to be here to stay... There are a LOT of
ways to bypass detection, one of them would be something to this
effect... I wrote this to test something after reading the original post, this took
10 minutes, and it is a simple proof of case that there ARE ways around
"Abnormal activity".  What is attached is very very simple, its your basic
syn flooder with large packets (8k per packet), each packet coming from a
different ip address (spoofed), obtained from a spoof file, this spoof
file is then reused x number of times as specified by the cycle parameter.
Please note: I didnt write this to use myself, I wrote this to test
something and as a proof of case, and believing in total disclosure
security policies and freedom of information Ive decided to open the code
to see if anyone can find a way around this type of thing.
The thing with this code, is that it is virtually impossible to block,
along with the actual DOS code is a thing called resetgen.c, that
resetgen.c generates another 1000 spoofed ips, if each host were to cycle
their spoof files once, run that, cycle again, in a loop, and you ran this
from a number of hosts at a time, the only way to block the traffic would
be to firewall out the port in question completely, because the packet
type is of type syn, if you block syn, nothing can connect to the port in
Basically, people who claim to be able to stop DDOS/trace DDOS/etc etc I
believe are playing on the public, making money out of a situation that
unfortunatly has no end in site, due to the fuckups made in the IP
protocol by the department of defense when they released the RFC.

If the attacker has a large number of slave machines, each machine is
spoofing from 1000 addresses (I.E sending 1000 packets each one from a
different address, and then cycling these addresses or generating another
1000 different addresses), it becomes VERY VERY difficult to block.
Look at it this way...
1000 machines, each sending 1000 packets, from 1000 spoofed addresses, each
packet is 8k big...
7812meg is therefore sent in payload size (as with my example code), per
cycle, from a total of 1 million addresses.
Because each packet is a SYN packet, probably aimed for a legit opened port
(like port 80) and it looks like a standard normal start of a connect, the
firewall will never block these packets, if the firewall DOES attempt to
auto shun these packets at the address level, the firewall will attempt to
insert 1 million rules in the space on under 5 minutes, its almost sure to
fall over.  If the firewall doesnt fall over and DOES succeed in these rule
insertions, it will have effectively blocked a fairly major part of the
internet from ever accessing your server that is being DoS'ed.
With 1000 machines, each sending 10 8k packets per second (80k/sec), you are
running at 80000k/sec, that is to say almost 80gigabit, enough to kill an
OC-48 dead in the water.
At this point, to stop and block and trace is almost impossible, and there
are still PLENTY of places you can send spoofed packets from that arent
blocking these things, besides, if you block them, unless you block them
VERY high up, your ISP is gonna be dead in the water anyway and your
blockage is gonna do nothing to stop it anyway
If anyone has other opinions on what Ive said above, please let me know :)

Most DDOS attacks forge their source address, changing between
large numbers of forged addresses, so the site under attack can't
defend itself by blocking the addresses that attack it.
If a Bad Guy has thousands of slave machines, they can still
launch a big attack, but if they need to use their own addresses,
the target can block the attackers (still not easy for large numbers,
but at least it's possible.)

I must admit Im rather sad to see efnet going this route, having been on
efnet for years and participated and become and active member of many of the
more underground channels on the network, I find it sad to see that the only
irc network where anarchy truely ruled has come to this.
I can however see their reasoning, having looked at efnext, I notice you can
no longer do certain things, /links doesnt work, which means the hubs are
hidden, and splits cant be seen, this means far less smurfing, because there
is no point to smurfing  a leaf server.
You also cannot see the servers someone is linked to if you /whois them,
this stops a number of denial of service attacks.
As for IRC Operators getting involved in channel affairs, if this happens,
people WILL run to another network, maybe I live under an illusion, but I
believe that the anarchy on networks like efnet is inbred in the people, and
is not so much about the network where the people reside, but the people
themselves, and if the anarchy and the control of their own channels is
taken from them, the people will get up and move somewhere where they still
have control.  Their is NOTHING forcing people to move to efnext, and
speaking from experience, setting up and running irc servers is easy, lets
face it, with a decent *nix system you can have an ircd up and running in a
matter of 5 or 10 minutes, an entire network is no more than an hour if you
are linking 10 systems.
Further more, IRC does NOT take that much bandwidth, there is a myth that
efnet NEEDS OC3 links etc because of the traffic that is passed across it,
what people dont say is that the servers actually only run at between 1 and
2 megabit/second if you remove the traffic from DDOS and attacks like smurf.
As for myself, I will still be on efnet, but other than that I will retire
to blabbernet, sure there are services there, and sure its small, but its
non-censored, anarchial, anything goes, and people dont tell me what to do.
Btw, another point I forgot to mention, there is encrypted IRC out there,
there are encrypted protocols built into scrollz for public channel, dcc,
and private message.  If anyone wants more information contact me, I might
also try and release a patch for bitchx and ircII to do the same thing if I
get the time to do some coding and can figure out the crypto code (I dont do
much crypto code unfortunatly)
Anyway, the above are just my opinions.

The answer to this question is actually fairly simple, it is VERY easy to
block smurfing in the form of amplification, I.E that is to say that you can
stop yourself being an amplifier, this helps your outgoing bandwidth.
However, to stop yourself being smurfed you have to stop all incoming ICMP
Echo Reply packets coming into your host at your upstream, because what you
are getting from a smurf are NOT ping request packets, they are ICMP echo
reply packets coming from other amplifiers, which means you could be getting
ICMP echo reply packets from 10 thousand + hosts at a time, and there is
little you can do to block it other than have your uplink firewall it.  The
problem is that by the time the ICMP reaches the uplink, the uplink has
probably been saturated, or at least is upset enough over their loss of
bandwidth to possibly cut your connectivity.  It is pretty pointless
blocking ICMP echo replies on the IRC server itself as well, because by the
time the packets get dropped at the server, they have already passed over
the lines and saturated the lines.
Kinda sad hey?

I have a question: given that half the bandwidth and almost all
of the spike bandwidth is devoted to smurfing, why don't IRC
servers just block multicast ping? I mean, okay, so it's in the
kernel code instead of being a separate application.  It still
shouldn't be hard to come up with a patch that killed smurfing.
Pings should never be forwarded to multiple hosts.

Hi all,
I was reading this article and I must say that I find the author to be
rather biased and strongly disagree with some of the things he said, for
To acknowledge that Tempest Smith's classmates were exerting cruel
psychological torture on the young woman with the hymns their church had
taught them would be to indict not only the school children, but the hymns
as well. To make this tragic event public knowledge would be to put a mirror
to the face of the majority, forcing them to see the intolerance in their
own eyes, crumbling their arguments that it no longer exists.
The use of hymns to impose psychological tramour on someone else cannot
indict the hymns themselves, that is total and utter bullshit, is that not
the same as saying that when someone uses a steak knife to stab someone, the
person who did the stabbing is responsible as well as the knife?  Total
utter crap.
Cassie Bernall was not persecuted because of her beliefs, she was gunned
down at random by madmen. Tempest Smith was driven to suicide by the
constant harassment from her peers, who were singling her out specifically
for her religion. The former's death was a senseless act of violence, the
latter's the result of hate.
They claim persecution due to belief, but at the same time Ive been around
wiccans, and I would be very very interested to know just how much pushing
of her beliefs she did on other people, because Ive heard the ridicule of
Christians that come out of wiccan mouths.  I dont agree with any form of
religious persecution, and I believe that a person should be able to believe
what they want, and express it how they want, providing that they dont push
it on other people, hence, if this story is infact true, the kids that
pushed her to suicide were wrong, but Im interested to hear what she did to
incite this, because I seriously doubt kids singing hymns at her without
either provocation from her or alternatively pushing from their
Anyway, I just thought I would give my comments

Huh? Apparently you've never had the treatment; children can be intolerant
as hell. Primary school gave me the most frightening examples of herd
behavior I've *ever* seen.
Heh, that wasnt my point, I wasnt trying to say that primary school kids
dont provoke, and dont cause trouble, etc etc, my point was that most
primary school kids would definatly find other means than singing Christian
hymns at her, in my experience kids are not ones for singing hymns, they
prefer to act in far less subtle ways?  Maybe Im wrong? *shrug*
