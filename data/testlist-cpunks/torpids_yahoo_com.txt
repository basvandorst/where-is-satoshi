@_subject: [tor-relays] VPS Hardware Specification & Advice 
i just saw this post on the web archive and felt I can contribute
something here so I finally registered. Maybe this reply will not be
correctly recognized to the thread, sorry.
The VPS specs you posted should be more than enough - but the price is
too expensive!
I currently run about 20 Tor relays on cheap VPS all around the world:
Basically I just care for the bandwidth/included traffic when choosing
a VPS. 256MB RAM is enough, disk space doesn't matter at all. Tor
doesn't scale that well with CPU cores so 1 core is ok. For only 1 or
2 of my VPS the CPU is the bottleneck (at about 20-30MBit/s), but most
are fast enough. Most cheap VPS are based on the OpenVZ virtualization
which limits you to their old kernel and sometimes they limit the
number of tcp connections (see "cat /proc/user_beancounters"). KVM or
Xen virtualisation is better because you have more control on the VM.
Most VPS providers add up the incoming and outgoing bandwidth, meaning
that you might be able to just send about 500GB with your 1TB plan.
For example with a VPS from  for 15€ per month it is
possible to push more than 1TB PER DAY(!) (and not per month as with
the 18€ plan you mentioned). OVH just released a server for £2,99 per
month with unlimited 100MBit/s as well:
Other typical offers are like 10TB for 10$ or 20MBit/s unlimited for 3€.
