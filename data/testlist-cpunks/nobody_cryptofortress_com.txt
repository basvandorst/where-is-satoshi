Re saddam et all...
The war of words over Saddam & Bush is quite amusing. The blind faith in ones
govt structure and the willingness to support force that is in such extreme
measure overpowering and statist such as the dropping of tons of depleted uranium
high explosives shows that some on this list have not broadened their news
reading beyond fox news.
What courage is required to fly at 40000 ft and drop the MOAB containing DU
on essentially defenceless targets? How can people think that Bush would never
harm civilians? It does not really matter if there are democrats in the whitehouse
or "republican" kings appointed by courts. Just because you choose not to deeply
examine the effects of the policies of your govt does not make them "reasonable".
Successful policies  and reasonable policies can be two different things. Its
possible to be both successful and reasonable. Its also possible to be successful
and un-reasonable...
Saddam merely gassed a few thousand people maybe. Bush senior's gulf war and
now Shrub's fine legacy will ensure the slow torturous death of many generations
of Iraqis and those American soldiers involved. The awful horrors of Stalin,
Hitler and Saddam will pass with a few generations... the half-life of DU is
in billions of years.Re American soldiers: Bush has cut medical care for active
duty personnel as well as veterans.(link via google search: The childish blind faith in US statist instituitions does not make their pronouncements
right.This is no better than those that blindly followed their communist or
nazi leaders.
The USA is at the heights of its power because of a well defined strategy of
monetary and military control of the world (the dollar as the currency of international
trade and its consequences, see links below).
Only the people of the USA can prevent the degeneration of their vaunted state
into a hellhole that will make the Soviets blush. The seeds are in place -
fine grained monetary oversight, 99.99% unsecured easily intercepted private
conversation, the shredding of the "bill of rights", willing armies of police
and other govt organized thugs, the impending death of the dollar as the only
currency of international trade, the overvalued stock market with absurd PEs,
the willingness to scam for a buck (Enrons, Halliburton etc), the lack of true
capitalism and open competition in certain sectors [eg medical cos, microsoft].
Those on this list should know better. Note: I'm not suggesting that this is
going to happen overnight, but as I said the seeds are in place...
Some links to ponder:
Why is the width of damage to the pentagon not as wide as a 757 (flt 77)?
Dollar and war: USS liberty [or the lies the US govt will tell]
Former KGB head consults for US Dept of homeland security:
Of course there will be the chest pounders vouching for their wonderful state...
about how all this is Internet garbage. Those unwilling to make a deep and
wide investigation are unteachable. Bush needs you.

@_subject: Nevada Supreme Court rules suspect must give police ID 
So if you are sitting on a public park bench in Nevada, with no ID that you can "produce" on your person, and you so inform an officer asking you for ID, are you now guilty of "resisting and obstructing a police officer" in the state of Nevada?
Should you wear your ID with a neck chain, when showering, for example, to avoid the possibility of "resisting and hindering", or would it be reasonable to simply wait for your chip We need to remember that police officers are not here to protect our freedom, rather we are here to protect their safety, and we just have to accept the destruction of the Bill of Rights and other risks, so they can be safer. We must understand that police don't exist to make us safe, rather we exist to make police safe. Do we get a badge or something? Bagpipes playing when they shoot the remaining tatters of the 6th amendment?
Home of the surveilled, land of the cowards, God bless America. Please tune into your TV now for the next Homeland Security threat warning. Be afraid.

@_subject: Why anyone on this list might give a crap about QM 
Here's why wavefunction collapse matters, or might.
A few months ago, we were debating the "End of the Golden age of crypto", and that went into a discussion of the inherent (or not!) difficulty wrt factoring large numbers consisting of big primes.
And the question that was raised (and is still on the table), is whether 1) is it possible that one day factoring will be 'cracked' and become much easier, 2) whether factoring will always remain dificult, or 3) will we be able to prove 2 above or will we have to live with the uncertainty forever?
Quantum Cryptography is a possibility that could allow 'us' (ie, whoever will have access to it) to 'know' for sure that our transmission is secure, based on physical law.
This security only exists, however, if we believe current quantum mechanical theory, which says that...
1) Wavefunction collapse happens at measurement time
2) There are no hidden variables
3) ANY attempt to read what the photon states 'really' are will collapse the wavefunction
4) An eavesdropper of a Quantum-encrypted code must necessarily reveal their presence, due tpo the fundamental QM laws of the universe.(4 logically follows from 1,2 and 3 above.)
In other words, the use of Quantum Cryptography is an attempt to eliminate the uncertainty associated with difficult (but classical) cryptosystems. But it only eliminates the uncertainty if we believe reality really works this way.

Of the 266 Google news links about Policy Analysis Market this morning, most of the headlines trumpet "Defense Department Taking Terror Bets." Policy Analysis Market is an attempt to use the wisdom of markets to predict crises and attacks in the Middle East.  The organizations behind the project include the Economist Intelligence unit, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (they funded the original Internet), and Net Exchange, a spinoff from the California Institute of Technology devoted to commercialize " computational combinatorial deal-making PAM states this about the whole concept: "Analysts often use prices from various markets as indicators of potential  events. The use of petroleum futures contract prices by analysts of the Middle East is a classic example. The Policy Analysis  Market (PAM) refines this approach by trading futures contracts  that deal with underlying fundamentals of relevance to the Middle East. Initially, PAM will focus on the economic, civil, and military  futures of Egypt, Jordan, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Turkey and the impact of U.S. involvement with each."
What is controversial is that market futures about "the overthrow of King Hussein of Jordan" were included and have offended politicians here in the US and undoubtedly in Jordan, Saudi Arabia, etc. . Others are upset that a trader can actually make some money if he/she predicts fairly accurately.  Trading starts October 1, 2003, and you can signup now. There will be a cutoff after 1000 registrants, and while they hope to have a globally distributed network of participants, what if a significant number were nettime readers?
I first ran into this market concept about ten years ago. The Iowa Political Stock Market successfully predicted the outcome of the 1992 U.S. presidential election within a few tenths of a percentage point for all three candidates (including Perot).  It was more accurate than 8 major polls. Since then there have been many other experiments with other markets: Hollywood Stock Exchange where people bet on future box office receipts and Foresight Exchange where traders bet on the outcomes of unresolved scientific and societal questions.

You clearly know virtually nothing about Palladium.  NCAs do not have
"complete access to private information".  Quite the opposite.  Rather,
NCAs have the power to protect private information such that no other
software on the machine can access it.  They do so by using the Palladium
software and hardware to encrypt the private data.  The encryption is
done in such a way that it is "sealed" to the particular NCA, and no other
software is allowed to use the Palladium crypto hardware to decrypt it.
In the proposed usage, an NCA associated with an ecommerce site would seal
the data which is used by the user to authenticate to the remote site.
The authentication data doesn't actually have to be a certificate with
associated key, but that would be one possibility.  Only NCAs signed by
that ecommerce site's key would be able to unseal and access the user's
authentication credentials.  This prevents rogue software from stealing
them and impersonating the user.
If you read the entire message it was clearly referring to a
Palladium-enabled web browser.  And Palladium is more than a hardware
technology; it includes hardware and software components.
Fine, at least you admit you're a whore.  But you'll probably do even
better if you learn how it actually works.  Seriously, have you read any

The Nexus is like a mini-OS for the trusted side of the machine.  It acts
as a kernel to manage the "trusted applications", the Nexus Computing
Agents or NCAs.
So what this sentence is really saying is that only one (trusted) OS
will be able to run at a time on a machine.  That's not that surprising
or significant.  Most machines only run one OS at a time.  Sure, with
virtualization and similar techniques you can manage to run more than
one OS at once, but that's unusual.  Probably 99.9% of machines are only
running one OS at a time.
Virtualization is not an option with trusted computing because part of
the point is to be able to offer assurance to remote users about what
the machine will do (i.e. its behavior is predictable, hence trusted).
This implies that it only makes sense to run one trusted OS at a time.
That's probably all the "important" sentence above means.
Right, plus it schedules, loads them, etc, like an OS kernel.  Here is
a simplified form of a diagram they use.  The left hand side is the
legacy mode, with normal Windows applications and OS.  The right hand
side is the new trusted mode, with NCAs as the applications and Nexus
as the OS.
       Normal Mode                  Trusted Mode
Yes, it sounds like it will work exactly like that.  Plus, hopefully
it will be possible for Linux to create its own Nexus ("Linexus"?) that
uses the same hardware features to provide TC capabilities for that OS.
Recall that Linus Torvalds recently adopted the position that DRM was
an acceptable technology for Linux, even when it involved being built
into the kernel.  Since DRM is the main downside to TC for many people,
and TC has many more good aspects beyond DRM, it is a near certainty
that Linux will add support for Trusted Computing.
Right, he could watch all the Disney movies he wanted, without paying
for them!  Mwaa haa haa!  Foolish humans!
But seriously, these systems can only raise the cost of security.
Neither cypherpunks nor Sony should risk their collective lives that no
one will break Palladium, by hook or by crook.

@_subject: Crypto-making vs Crypto-breaking 
A few years ago I discovered that this allows the bank to "mark" the cash.
The bank can use a different exponent k' instead of the exponent k it
is supposed to be using, on certain withdrawals.  On every deposit,
it checks the incoming coin using both k and k', and is able to quietly
identify the marked withdrawals.
In more detail: during withdrawal, the user submits y * g^b.  The bank,
to mark the cash, raises it to the k' power rather than the k power.
The creates y^k' * g^bk'.  The user unsuspectingly unblinds by calculating
g^kb and dividing it, leaving y^k' * g^(b(k'-k)).  This is what is later
submitted to the bank, along with y.
The bank, at this point, knows y, k, k', g, and the product above.
It does not know b.  It can calculate y^k' and divide to get g^(b(k'-k)).
It can raise to the inverse power of (k'-k) to get g^b.  Now it can
multiply by y to get y * g^b.
This is the same value which was submitted to be signed in the first
place.  By keeping a record of the values which were signed using the
special k' exponent, the bank can look back and see which one this one
is, thereby linking the deposit to the withdrawal, which is exactly what
blinding is supposed to prevent.
In order to avoid this, the bank can prove that it operated correctly
(that is, it raised its input to the same k power that g is raised to
in the public g^k value) using a zero-knowledge proof.  I believe the
latest version of the Lucre software does this.
However, it's possible that the Lucre ZK proof is only honest-verifier
zero knowledge.  An honest-verifier ZK proof is one which is ZK only
if the verifier follows the protocol; for example, when it is supposed
to choose a random value, it in effect flips a coin.  The point of a ZK
proof is that a transcript is unconvincing to third parties, because the
verifier would have been able to create a fake transcript.  He could do
so by, in effect, working backwards from chosen results to figure out
what his coin flips would have had to be.
However, if the verifier chooses his bits using a fixed sequence like a
strong PRNG, then when he reveals the transcript, he can also show that
his "random" bits were determined by his PRNG seed.  This proves that
he did not in fact have the flexibility to choose his bits by working
backwards, and therefore the proof is convincing to a third party.
In this case, the transcript of the "ZK proof" would in fact prove that
the bank knew the k of g^k.  The transcript is therefore a signature,
and in conjunction with the coin, it is arguably a blind signature.
Blind signatures are patented until July, 2005.
Given that the whole point of this application of Wagner blinding was
to avoid the Chaum blind signature patent; that that patent expires in
two years; that the current licensee has shown no effort to enforce the
patent; that Wagner blinding also risks falling under another patent,
on Chaum's undeniable signature; and that the bank's operation even with
Wagner blinding looks an awful lot like a blind signature; then why not
just use Chaum's blinding?  It would be enormously simpler, and safer too.
It's far more widely analyzed and there are a number of improvements in
the literature.

Police, Dressed As Homeless, Give Tickets
Thu May 22, 7:25 AM ET
KISSIMMEE, Fla. - Homeless advocates are outraged by an operation where
undercover police officers dressed as vagrants, observed drivers running
red lights or committing other traffic violations, then radioed ahead to
other officers who stopped those cars and wrote tickets.
"Operation Vagrant," a sting operation involving the Florida Highway
Patrol, Kissimmee police and the Osceola County Sheriff's Office, nabbed
171 drivers  most of whom ran red lights, a violation that carries an
$83 fine.
Undercover deputies stood along streets and gave the indication they
were vagrants by pushing shopping carts and wearing fake teeth and
tattered clothing. They also carried small cardboard signs, which read,
"Sheriff's traffic sting in progress. Buckle up."
"It's kind of appalling," said Marilyn Gordon, executive director of the
Homeless Services Network of Central Florida. "I wonder if it will be a
consciousness-raising exercise for the law-enforcement officers."
Robert H. Brown, president and chief executive officer of the Coalition
for the Homeless of Central Florida, said the officers were being silly.
"It's ironic that they would use a disguise of someone that people think
of as visually offensive," Brown said. "I just think it shows that the
community's aware of the homeless problem. I wish they would solve it,
rather than masquerading."
Osceola sheriff's bureau Chief Jerry Geier said the sting was designed
to raise awareness about dangerous intersections.
Nearly 25,000 drivers were ticketed for running red lights in Florida in
2001, and 107 deaths that year were attributed to drivers disregarding
traffic signals. Plus, police nationwide started a new initiative this
week to call attention to dangers of riding in a vehicle without using a
seat belt.
"Our ultimate goal is to make an impact," Geier said. "The last thing
we're trying to do is disrespect anybody."
State Rep. Irv Slosberg, D-Boca Raton, an advocate of stronger seat-belt
and other traffic-safety laws, applauded the sting operation. His
daughter, Dori, 14, was killed in a 1996 traffic accident in which she
did not wear a seat belt.
"I admire them for being creative," Slosberg said.
