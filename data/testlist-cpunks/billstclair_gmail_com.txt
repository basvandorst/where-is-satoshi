digitally-signed vault and trading system. Inspired by Patrick
Chkeroff's Loom.cc, but with digital signatures for security. The
first version of a web client is available for beta testing. Check it

Somehow I doubt they'll appreciate my perspective:
1) Completely eliminate the Department of Homeland Security
2) Remove all infringements on the right to keep and bear arms and
return to the homeland security the founders envisioned, the
unorganized militia.
It would be hard to even state my perspective at their site. It splits
the problem up into umpteen components, and expects you to comment on
them individually, assuming that their compartmentalization of the
problem is the only possibility.

I haven't seen details on how this works, but from the short
description on that Wikipedia page, which matches Google's
description, the PIN enables the NFC antenna, which allows the "Secure
Element" chip to communicate over the NFC radio link. The NFC station
can then query the Secure Element for the user credentials, which I
assume are sent encrypted with the credit card issuer's public key. So
you'd have to send transmission over the NFC radio link's limited
range that looks to the Secure Element to be coming from a credit card
issuer. Hopefully, the encryption between the credit card issuer and
the Secure Element is end-to-end, so there's no way for anybody else
to snoop on it. So if you can steal the PIN, hack the OS to simulate
that PIN being typed, while the user is close to an NFC station that
can impersonate a valid credit card issuer, you're golden. Sounds hard
to me.
Lots of guesses there, however. I hope Google will publish the
protocols. Maybe they already have. I didn't look.

The FBI agents involved should be taken before a Grand Jury seeking an
indictment for kidnapping. If indicted, and found guilty by a jury of their
peers, they should be hanged. There was no crime here, other than the
kidnapping. The man sold vegetables to people who wanted them.

That's the single charge on the complaint that might have some merit, but
apparently they have no body, nor any evidence that the victim even exists,
other than electronic messages. And, he was being blackmailed, in an
environment where he couldn't go to the authorities, since they would
arrest HIM, not the blackmailer. Another situation in which the drug war
causes unintended (or maybe not) consequences.
