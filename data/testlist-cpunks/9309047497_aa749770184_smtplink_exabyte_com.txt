Yes.  Make "noise addition" (really multiplexing) part of the cipher.  You
could throw away every other bit based on the parity of the key.  The
ciphertext would be twice as big, but if you compressed both plain text
streams first, this effect might not be very obvious.  Of course, if your
encryption program were disassembled, you might be found out...
