In Message 23 Dec 92 00:49:30 EST,
By including your public key WITH your signed messages, aren't you inviting
people to intercept it, replace it with they're own public key, and re-sign
the message?  If I didn't have a trusted copy of your public key already I
wouldn't be able to verify your signature.
