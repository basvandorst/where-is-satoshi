I have registerd the domain-name replay.COM at InterNic.
XS4all has installed some sort of MX-handling for my account,

The remailer that is operated from that account is now also
reachable at the replay.com address. The usura at xs4all.nl
remains valid.
Raph Levien has updated the address in his automated pinger;

In article  you stated:
: What's the update on the move to ban private crypto in Holland? : Last I remember there were trial balloons, but nothing happened.
The proposed ban came from the former fundamentalist christian led
department of justice. Since the elections the political landscape
has been changed, the christian democratic party has been removed,
we now have Liberals (something like Republicans in the US :) ),
Socialists and Social Democrats in power. Law Enforcement has come under public scrutiny, since special police
teams used unlawful tactics to get criminal organizations out of their business. They broke into Warehouses to see if narcotics were
depostid there (without a warrant), they made up reports and lied in
court. The new head of the justice department, already has dropped some policies that were in place, and she just announced that due to the
rise in competence of the LEA the rights a suspect has also have to be
raised in order to compensate it. She swiftly killed of any opposition
the LEA had against that proposal. In my opinion, The Netherlands will not adopt a crypto policy on their
own, the'll do it if the EC proposes such a "thing". Alex de Joode					    usura at replay.com	                               Hate mail appreciated,

The enrty point of a remailer could be "fixed", the exit point is where

 - The entry point of a remailer is entry at remail.org,  - entry at remail.org has a forward file to: batch at remail.org

   installed some sort of MX'ing all messages that leave batch at remail.org

 - If you "loose" expendable.org, you simple set up a new account with

   the enrty-point of that remailer is still entry at remail.org

: Perhaps this has already been voiced on the main list (I get a filtered

: It's like giving Microsoft a trademark on the term 'Email'...  It's nuts!
: Was the term ecash not in use before DigiCash showed up on the scene? Untill januari 1st 1996 you could trademark anything in The Benelux.
A bank (ABM*AMRO) has a trademark on 'the bank'; they essentially
upgraded a generic name into a trademark, but the recent changes made that impossible since the Benelux Trademark Buro has to check if a name is a generic name and they now have the power to refuse a registration. bEST Regards,

: Actually, this would be quite easy.  The "watermark" would be a : signal that plays inband, but out of our hearing range during the : entire CD.  The human ear can only hear in the 20-20,000 (Hz, KHZ?, : whatever) range.  It would be trivial to add a digital ID signal at, : say 30,000 or 15 or something like that.  This could then be decoded, : if need be.  This seems the easiest and most efficient way.  This : could also be defeated with a lot of $$ (and/or a LOT of HD space).  : If the frequecy is known (it can be found out) it can easily be run : through recording studio eqipment that can very effectively isolate : the frequency and cut it out.  If you have a LOT of HDD space : (digital audio at 2 stereo tracks, not sure of the sampling rate or : bit resolution, takes about 20MB of HDD space per minute (2 tracks, : good sampling and bit rate) ) you could probably find the freq. HDD space is -cheap- 2 gig drives sell voor 350 usd in Holland,
most music cd's contain 70 minutes of recording thus -at your 20 Mb per minute rate- would require 1.4 gigs. So basicly 'CD-pirates' need to buy a PC with a 2 gig HDD and
a CD-R, a 'one-off' investment of say 5000 usd; besides their
normal cd maunfacturing, packaging and transportation, those
additional 5000 usd are peanuts compared to the total investment
for pirating CD's.
: fairly easily by isolation and just edit it out, and write the new : stuff to a CD-R.  If the signal is purely digital, I would imagine : that it might be even easier that if it were an analog signal (?).  : Someone w/ good equipment (Digital Labs' stuff, or SAW (Software : Audio Workshop) would be able to do this w/o much problem.  The : question is is the price/effort worth it?  In quantity maybe.  On an : individual basis, only if you already happen to have the erquipment.
: I have a suspiscion that this type of thing will not really come to : any kind of fruition due to not only the ability to defeat this, but : mainly due to things like buying at a garage sale, etc.  If it did, : only MASS market piraters would be investigated.

What Mr. Bell probably means is that 'if the powers that be' decide to unilateraly change the rules, you are lost in limbo. The notion
that 'the powers that be' can be relied opun is seriously flawed,
for example take in account some of the dealings of our own guvment,
the abolishing of the WIR -overnight-, the proposals of Vermeent
that totally neglected art. 1 WvSr.
Basicly 'fraud' is a definition that benefits 'the powers that be',
one that seriously harms our rights and liberties. You also state
"If you want to play the game, play by its rules, otherwise don't play it." Well sometimes people have no other option then to play,
and dropping out if gouvernment changes the rules unilateraly can be to costly an option ..

There is a part that makes ISP liable if they cannot point to a

the business of being an ISP, running a remailer is not my business,
it is a 'not for profit' hobby, so it will be fun to see how "they"

All browsers have the 128 bits encryption inthem, but in the
