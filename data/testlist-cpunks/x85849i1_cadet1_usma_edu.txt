Everybody who receives mail from cypherpunks at toad.com received this
message becuase the message was addressed to cypherpunks at toad.com.  Apparently someone may have joined this 'group' or service and used the cypherpunks address as the e-mail address.  Mayhap the cypherpunks at toad.com / cypherpunks
userid/password. This would be my guess, of course.
Does anybody know what this service does?
