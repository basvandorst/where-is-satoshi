Dear rsw at jfet.org  customer
Sex can be one of the most enjoyable parts of your life. It strengthens relationships and
adds excitement.
Always be ready.
If you have a problem getting or keeping an erection, you are not alone. In fact, more than half of all men over forty have difficulties getting or maintaining an erection. This condition, called erectile dysfunction (ED), occurs with younger and older men as well, but there's a safe, effective and easy method of treatment: Viagra.
When the time is right, you'll always be ready.
