@_subject: List of mail -> news gateways? 
There is a list of them in the remailer info that you can get by sending
mail to mg5n+remailers at andrew.cmu.edu
I don't have any german ones tho... uk is the closest one to you that I
know of.  These are the ones I have:
group-name at cs.utexas.edu
group.name.usenet at decwrl.dec.com
group.name at news.demon.co.uk
group.name at news.cs.indiana.edu
group-name at pws.bull.com
Please tell me if any of you know of any others!!!
(I know of the Berkeley and CMU ones, but they both block off-camous
mail so I didn't list them.)
