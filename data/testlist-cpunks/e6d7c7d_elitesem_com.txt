Aloha, my dear friend!
I've decided to write to you. The quantity of words is never what is important, but what counts is the quality of those words.
A perfect love, a best friend and a good wife is what a man is looking for. I am a passionate and romantic woman, but for a man who can inspire my heart and soul, that man would be treated like a king. You are special, maybe you are my destiny.
I would not like to spend a lot of time finding out. I would like to come to you, to meet you and I want you to take me away with you if that is truly what you wish deep in your heart and your soul and I can assure you that I would make you the happiest man in the world.
You would be covered by kisses and caresses. You can not imagine the intensity of the love and the feelings I could give to a man like you.
You could think that you are dreaming.
It is up to you to let me know what you think, what you feel and what you truly hope and wish for you. You can find me here Sincerely yourth
