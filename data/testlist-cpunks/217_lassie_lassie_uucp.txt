Look, just forget the rest of the bullshit and go away and come
back when you've got good working compression at about 12kbits/sec,
so that you can run it down a v32bis over slip or ppp.  All the
rest of the stuff has been written already (nevot, vat etc)
When you've done that we'll start taking you seriously.
PS Oh yes, I foprgot: it has to be done on something less beefy than a
high-speed sparc... any idiot can do that with off the shelf code already.
