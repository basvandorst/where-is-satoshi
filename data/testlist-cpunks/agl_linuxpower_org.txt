Is this really a bad thing? Music is becomming a public service. When author
cannot control their works (as is happening now) the works basically become
a public service - and the way public services are funded is by govt taxes. If
they stop trying (and failing) to control content and just use this - well
it's not perfect - but it's better than a DMCA/UCITA world.
My worry is that they distribute this money only to the big record companies
and screw the 'real musicians'

Correction - servers are the price of *easy* scalability. See Freenet for an
example of self-organizing networks that are efficient. But it isn't easy,
self-org networks are complex and subtle beasts. It depends on if the extra
work is worth it (I'm writing a Freenet node and I can tell you it's a
significant chunk of work)

Quotes from "Federal regulators have ruled that the major networks should have identified the White House as a sponsor of programs such as "The Practice," "The Drew Carey Show" and "America's Most Wanted" when their plots included anti-drug messages for which the government paid the networks millions of dollars"
"During the past two years, networks including ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox received a total of $25 million for including anti-drug messages in prime-time programming. It was revealed at congressional hearings that the White House reviewed scripts for more than 100 shows to determine if the anti-drug message of a particular program was strong enough to merit payment"
"We have been told by these programmers that they have influenced the programs in order to please the government. That is not the kind of free press we have grown accustomed to," Stroup said
Aren't you glad that your tax $$$ are being spent so well?
I guess this is what they mean when they talk about educating
the population.
