@_subject: Work on your site without being online 
What do you mean download the page!?  You should have a copy
of your complete website available on your local computer.  Thus
you can work on the site without an internet connection. With an
online connection absolute URL's like a BeSeen counter will still
function on your local site.  Sure it will throw the actual counter
numbers off a little ... but those things aren't 100% accurate anyway.
(Next time you see one on someone's page try hitting "Reload" a
couple times.)
Having a local copy of your site means you can make changes
and ascertain that changes are acceptable before uploading.  Most
importantly, it protects you from losing the entire website if something
happens to your service provider.  If his hard drive crashes tomorrow
are you ready to rebuild your site from scratch?
Finally, FTP your redesigned pages to the server.  Overwrite the
existing file and you'll never have "helpful" software agents
disagreeing with your changes.

SITE  REVIEWED!
Comments on Site   webmaster at alabastercove.com
I like the look of the site, colors are nice. Both the logo and the
header need to be optimized for the web to improve the
resolution.  Too grainy and distorted.  Background for the
and header need to be uniform.
Yes, you do say that this site is unlike any other.  It is, however,
a site that I would not bookmark nor return to.
Why?  Just too much stuff!  Nothing clearly states the purpose
of the site nor tells the visitor what to do.
I reviewed site # 135 alabastercove.com  i use Internet explorer
and I have to say I never made it past the first 2 pages. Between
several pop up windows (gosh I hate those!) and poor display with
windows covering text on the first paragraph i just couldn't force
myself to take any more time there! It's a shame as it looks like it's
an interesting site with great recipes.  Please lose some of the
up windows!
First Impression: opening page = nice
I was ready for a stroll at a beach expecting to be invited to spend
relaxing weekend at a lovely place on the beach. If that is actually
part of
this site someplace, I never found it.
Still on page one:
The animated banner is a little annoying. I prefer static banners.
But this
page is okay and left me with anticipation.
Then the nightmare began. pop up banners from every corner it seemed.
The one
with the camera took up the entire screen and I thought that that was
When closing that window, there was again a page filled with a jumble
recipes, and heavens knows what else. I never found the beach I wanted
relax on.
So I went home, disappointed.
The color grey/subdued pink is really nice and if you do have a beach
share I'd love to see pictures but I surely am not willing to wade
through a
mile of flotsam before I get there.
In other words, pages which have tons of pop-ups, flashing banners etc.
just so annoying even relative newbies like myself will not hang around,
less the more sophisticated surfer.
The first time I clicked into this site it took forever for the front
page to load (specifically the lighthouse graphic).  I have a
connection, but this one was one of the slowest sites I've come across.
After it was in my cache and I went back again later, it wasn't so
In trying to see what the site was about, I almost gave up and quit
clicking things when nothing ever came up.  If it wasn't for the
that I was trying to review it, I would have given up before I got
the Y4 page.  I think you will lose any traffic that makes it
past the
slow-loading front page unless you put something in those blank
pages to let them know you really are there and have a purpose.
This website made a promising start and I was pleased to see a
navigation bar on the top of each page.  However, each page has
no content although one is invited to search on each page (but
search for what?)
They appear to auction on Ebay and take PayPal but I couldn't
find any products or any info from clicking the smart top navigation
bar and gave up after a few pages.  This website desperately needs
some content!  There's little point in having navigation bars
links to FAQs, About Us, etc when each page is an identical blank one...
I hate pop up windows - especially those that take forever to load,
and completely cover the original website - you never know where
you really are.
This site needs a professional touch - the navigation links are hard
read, and the click-on logo on page one is - well, I not very clear!!!
The gray background is dreary and the pages take too long to load.
I don't know why you would want someone to be able to view your
site statistics, but I have never seen that before so I clicked it. 
had 1 visitor today and that might be me.  You had twelve visitors
this week, and your site is full of ads for companies that can explode
your web traffic.
The top 5 links box was in my way.  It took forever to load the
(56k) probably because of all the scripts you have running your
popups.  It took me even longer to write this review because I
your site open on my browser right now and it keeps freezing every
30 seconds to run another pop up script.
I can't read the words in the navigation banner at the top.
While you admit that you can't categorize the focus of your
website...this does not make it ok.  What is this website for?
It is a bunch of links and even more advertisements.  I couldn't
even bring myself to click one link, because I'm so sick of the
constant popups.  If you are trying to make money with the ads
on your site, you have to build a site that will bring visitors who
will stay.  You can't market everything to everyone.  Pick
a focus
for the site.  Pick a target audience, and market to them.
