@_subject: [p2p-hackers] Announcing SocialVPN version 0.3 
Dear p2p-hackers,
We have a new version of the open-source (GPL v2) SocialVPN P2P software
that might be of interest to some of you:
This system self-organizes P2P VPN links among peers connected by an online
social network. It builds on the Brunet P2P library and the IPOP overlay
developed by the ACIS P2P group at U. Florida, supporting transparent NAT
traversal and dynamic IP address/DNS name allocation and translation.
Key improvements over the Facebook-based version announced in this list a
while ago include:
- the use of XMPP for peer discovery and certificate exchange (it's been
tested with Google chat as well as with ejabberd)
- a Web-based user interface, and
- code/API re-structuring to facilitate programming of bindings to other
online social networks by external developers.
We run a public bootstrap overlay on PlanetLab; our code is hosted at
GitHub, and we have binaries for Linux and Windows available for download.
If you are interested in using or developing around this system, please feel
free to contact us.

In addition to STUN, we also have a decentralized mechanism to select 1-hop
relays in the overlay when NAT traversal fails. We have done
simulation-based studies and our empirical evidence from the deployed
SocialVPN/Brunet systems is that these approaches work pretty well, but we
don't have a study of the system "in the wild" with large numbers of real
users behind NATs. We are planning to reach to a reasonably large number of
users to use the software to collect this among other kinds of data; any
suggestions/ideas on how to reach out to potential users for an experiment
would be welcome.
