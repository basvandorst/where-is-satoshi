   [1]WorkEmail writes "A [2]far-reaching proposal from the FBI, made
   public Friday, would require all broadband Internet providers,
   including cable modem and DSL companies, to rewire their networks to
   support easy [3]wiretapping by police. The FBI's request to the
   Federal Communications Commission aims to give police ready access to
   any form of Internet-based communications. If approved as drafted, the
   proposal could dramatically expand the scope of the agency's wiretap
   powers, raise costs for cable broadband companies and complicate
   Internet product development."
