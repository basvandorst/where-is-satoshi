@_subject: Report available: "Minimal Key Lengths for Symmetric Ciphers" 
Ummm, apples and oranges. The report focused on symmetric-key algorithms.
Also, the recommendation was for a *minimum* of 90 bits. I'm sure the
authors would be ecstatic to see *128-bit* (not 2048) IDEA like PGP (or does
PGP encrypt with RSA, too? I thought it only used RSA for signing. I admit
it. I don't know). The purpose of the report was not "90 bits is good." It
was "40 bits is *really* bad."
