References: I like Bruce Schneier's take on this:
"The idea is for me to paint this stuff on my valuables as proof of
ownership. I think a better idea would be for me to paint it on your
valuables, and then call the police."

Unfortunately, I already have a large network of people who use AIM,
and >they< all each have large networks of people who use AIM. Many of
them still use the AIM client. Getting them to switch to gaim is
feasible. Getting them to switch to Jabber is not. However, getting
them to switch to gaim first, and then ultimately Jabber might be an
option. Frankly, the former is more important to me in the short
Does "can" == "have to"? From what I remember of trying to run Jabber
a few years ago, it did.

It would be helpful if you could specify the location of the private
key file, so then it could be on a thumb drive or something similar.

Of course, this could just be a smokescreen to try to convince people
that they can't already do it.
The voice traffic may be hard to break, but the fact that every client
can download my entire IM history when logging into a new machine kind
of kills the "it's p2p so we can't track it" argument. Those messages
are stored somewhere.
