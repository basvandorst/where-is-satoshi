One additional problem: almost no email providers will accept incoming email from dynamic IP addresses, and, unless you pay your ISP $$$, most people can't get a static IP address.
Someone else already mentioned uptime as an issue.

While this is something that could be possible, it is unlikely to have actually occurred. In reality, there is some security in ensuring that there is only one opportunity for an adversary to compromise communication. If they miss that opportunity, the adversary's game is over.
So, unless either 1) you are already of particular interest to the NSA, or 2) the NSA makes a habit of performing MitM attacks on people who email their public key, this protocol is probably safe for you. Not "256-bit equivalent" (or even "40-bit equivalent") safe, but probably safe.

It's probably not worth mentioning the sci.crypt newsgroup, is it? There is *occasionally* some intelligent discussion there.

References: If the message is chosen from a uniform distribution over n bits (and assuming that the message is not used for something else after it is deciphered), the adversary will not be able to distinguish a correctly deciphered message from an incorrectly deciphered message, no matter how short the key is in comparison to the data.
Now, you could easily argue that there is absolutely no reason to send a message with those properties, but that isn't really the point.

Sorry that this question is only tangentially related to cryptography.
Then again, a lot of the stuff here is only tangentially related.
Could anybody here link me to some good resources on chaos theory? I'm
not looking for anything specifically about certain chaotic systems
(like the Lorentz Attractor or Chua's circuit), but instead about
general methods to identify and evaluate chaotic systems. Maybe
something related to calculating fractional dimensions, &c.
This would be a great help.
