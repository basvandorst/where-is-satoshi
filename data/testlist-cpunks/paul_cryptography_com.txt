@_subject: Differential Power Analysis 
Information is now available online about three related attacks we have developed at Cryptography Research: Simple Power Analysis, Differential Power Analysis, and High-Order Differential Power Analysis. The basic idea of the attacks is that the power consumption of a device (such as a smartcard) is statistically correlated to the operations it performs.  By monitoring the power usage (or electromagnetic radiation, etc.) during cryptographic operations, it is possible to obtain information correlated to the keys.  The collected data is then analyzed to actually find the keys.  The three attacks use increasingly sophisticated analysis methods. We have implemented the attack against a large number of smartcards, and have found all to be vulnerable.  At this point, we do not believe that any smartcards on the market are immune to these analysis techniques. There is now an initial summary on Differential Power Analysis on our web page at  and more information will be put on the website as it becomes available.  A condensed text version is attached below.  At this point, it's fine to talk about this with anyone and to forward this message.  Anything you can do to keep discussion of this technically accurate would be much appreciated. Paul Kocher
