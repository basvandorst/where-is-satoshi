@_subject: Elliptic Curve Public Key Crypto available 
in the cypherpunks ftp site /pub/cypherpunks/ciphers are 2 ascii files.  One contains code and the other contains documentation: eliptic.src and elliptic.doc.  The code portion is a cat'ed block of files: headers,
C sources and a set of prime numbers.  The documentation attempts to
explain the math, but it does help if you already know number theory.  It hopefully isn't necessary.
The code is a specific implementation of one particular type of math.  It violates no known patents.  It appears to work.  The academics claim that elliptic curves over Galois Fields are really secure.  Preliminary testing bears this out, changing one bit of input gives uniformly distributed "random" output.
Previous to the availabilty of 100 MHz processors this method of public key crypto was ridculously slow.  The only versions were laboratory curiosities implemented in ASIC hardware.  Code, if it exists, is not in the public domain.
The code is based on several papers (some 15 references are listed in the doc file, 6 are more directly important) and a couple of books.  It includes optimal normal basis math, elliptic curve math, and public key secret sharing.  With 128 bit symmetric encryption, a 226 bit field is more than sufficient to hide it.
I believe it is really strong crypto.  I did not invent anything.  I just implemented a few textbook examples that nobody else has.  Since it's from public domain sources, and it's now public domain software, it can be freely used.  You get what you pay for.  Code is a living thing.  It takes lots of people lots of time to make any code useful.  The purpose of this code is to show that there is more than one way to create public key cryptosystems and to bring academic discussion into the everyday realm of real world problems.  I suggest you get a copy to work with before it becomes illegal ;-)

Yes, the speedups are patented.  Their system relied on very specific curves with very specific properties.  I purposly avoided coding up their method because of that.  Their method is described in patent  dated Oct 27, 1992 and it uses a different equation (supersingular version) than what I implemented.  The price is slower speed, but with 100 MHz processors you won't notice.

@_subject: generating hash.curve in eliptic.src 
Among other comments, it was pointed out that I had not included "hash.curve".  To generate this file I did the following
This was done during development and I forgot about it.  A simpler patch is to fix an error finding the file with a call to rand_curv_pnt to generate it.
Kind of interesting that way for hashing your secret key.  If everyone uses a different curve to generate their secret key, access to the machine is necessary to even begin to think about cracking any pass phrase.
Don't know if actually adds any security, but it is an interesting concept.
As for why I didn't put up a tar file, no particular reason.  It's source for a particular machine (MachTen on a Mac) and I figured every C compiler is different so some hacking will be required by anyone interested.
Once more bugs are fixed such as the one above, I'll put it up in a more
easily compilable form.
And thanks for the comments so far.  I'll do my best to keep up with them.
Patience, persistence, truth,
Dr. mike
