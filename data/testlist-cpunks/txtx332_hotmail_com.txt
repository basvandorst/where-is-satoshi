@_subject: Initiatives - vigilante politics is for everyone!!! 
THIS BOOK IS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND!!!
THE FIX, by David R. Myrland
Every politically aware or politically active American should have this collection of initiatives, written by an analyst and researcher with remarkable insight and talent. For legal professionals and laypersons alike - a peaceful way to take the law into your own hands.
Dozens of provisions proposed to solve the things about government we like the least.
Initiatives to address the most intrusive encroachments on civil liberties, the excessive tactics of law enforcement, discrimination under licensing requirements - all in one book.
A responsible and firm hedge against the "homeland security" measures that unreasonably infringe on our most treasured liberties.
Decriminalize marijuana, limit pepper spray use, protect SS numbers, citizens' review panel, end state income taxes, limitations on the use of technology against the innocent, make gov't more friendly - who's the boss here anyway?!?! Fairness is lacking in so many instances involving gov't that somebody's got to do something.
Complaining aside, let's look at some answers, dozens of them!!!
