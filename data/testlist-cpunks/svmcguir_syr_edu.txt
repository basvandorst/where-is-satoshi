How much information about what someone reads can be gathered
by a news server?  Is there an anonymous way to read a public
news server, or would a server have to be set up intentionally
to allow anonymous reading?

Why not just encrypt the files with regular, single key encryption and only use
the public-key encryption on a master file holding a copy of all the individual
keys?  This would be faster right?

If the master file (or say master directory with one keyfile for each
encrypted file) is encrypted with public key encryption, than anyone with the
master public key can add a new encrypted file key but only the person with
the master private key can remove one of those keys.
Now that I think about it, this is like having each user encrypt their file
with a conventional key and sending a PGP encrypted message with the key they
used to the maintainer of the master file.  Of course if you don't trust the
users to give up a copy of the key, you would need to automate the procedure.

I recall you were interested in how the Austrians would answer this.  I
think that they would object to the question because of their aversion to
aggregates.  Some individuals are better off and some worse off.  The
Austrians would deny that you can sum the results for individuals and get
a result for the economy as a whole.  This is because of Austrian
Assume that I move a programming job to India, and make the required
capital investments.
I am presumably better off (otherwise I wouldn't have moved the capital).
The worker I fire here in the US is worse off.
(Other effects you have mentioned go here).
Now, considering only me and the laid off worker, is this change overall
good or bad?  To answer this, you would have to compare the value of my
gain to the value of the workers loss.  But you can't.  Value is
subjective.  And, it only gets harder when you try to take into account
the other people affected.

If possible, I suggest using a multi-user operating system (link linux
etc.) and setting up an account specifically for an anonymous user/nym.
Don't use the account for any non nym stuff.  This way, for example, there
won't be a signature file with a real name that might get accidently
appended to an email.

Just off the top of my head, the chips could come connected to a battery
to maintain an internal clock and be configured to stop functioning if it
is ever disconnected.  Since the life expectancy of one generation of a
cpu is so short now, limiting the life of a chip to that of a battery is
not much of a problem.  Also, if these are given away as was suggested,
the fact that a dead battery would kill your computer is no big deal.

It seems to me that this is where this scheme would be broken.  Have
intellectual property laws been (successfully) used in this way?  And even
if so, would they be enforced in all the countries where the chips might
be fabricated?

You should expect software companies to make more money and for prices to
come down.  Remember, there's not just one software company.  This scheme
would force some of the people who would copy software to buy it,
increasing the profits to the software companies.  So, why would the price
come down?  Well, because of the increased profit margin, there is now
room for the price to come down, and since there is competition among
software companies, at least one of them will lower prices for the
advantage it will give them.  The others will have to follow.

Unless the regulations apply to UPS, FED-EX etc., I don't see how the two
situations are comparable.  The government refusing to deliver packages
(via the USPS) unless certain conditions are met is not the same as saying
no one may deliver unless those conditions are met.  Now, passing email from its source, through  several remailers and to its destination does
not involve any government agency.  The government may still try to
control it, but they can't justify it by analogy to labeling of normal
mail (which they are involved in delivering).  ... snip ...

That message said:
I am using one of those email interfaces (premail + pine) and had trouble
reading your last message.  I had to save the PGP attachement to a file.
To quote it, I had to read it in from a file.  No big deal, and if I
changed software I could probably make it automatic.  I suspect most
people on the list have yet to set up any software of this type.  So if I,
already using such software, had a little trouble with one message, how
much trouble would others have?  Then if the entire list were encrypted?
I suspect the list would lose a lot of subscribers.

How hard would this be? (and would it work?)
Use an encrypted file system, something like Matt Blazes CFS which allows each
user to set up his own encrypted directories.  The encryption is file by file
so that backups can be made by the system, but the backups are still encrypted.
Unlike CFS, this system would allow public key cryptography.  The system could
write to a directory using the public key, but only the user could read from
the directory.  As usual, to speed things up, the PK cryptography would just be
used to encrypt/decrypt conventional keys which would be used for the
encryption/decryption of the data.  With this in place, when email comes in, it
could be stored in the recipient's directory of the hard drive.  I guess I'm
assuming that the user has a shell account.

It seems to me that they are actually selling two seperate things.  One is
connectivity the other storage.  The storage might have a different legal
status than the connectivity.  So, is email part of the connectivity or the
storage?  What is the legal status of phone company provided voice mail?  This
seems pretty close to email.
Do we know that if phone companies kept recordings of your conversations they
would have the same legal status as the records that they already keep?
It would be good to get ISP's to work this way regardless of the law.  Its
better for the data not to exist than have it legally hard to obtain.

@_subject: Usenet and Re: extortion via digital cash 
I've been thinking about the use of Usenet as a message pool and this seems to
be a good place to bring up my thoughts.  As an already existing, widely
disseminated and easily used message pool, Usenet is very valuable to us.  I'm
concerned that it may not last though.  Many people now complain about how low
the signal to noise ratio is (even more than they complain about this list). I've heard people say that they have given up on newsgroups in favor of mailing
list, web-zines, etc.  So, if it gets too bad, might it just fade away?  Or, if
it remains but becomes unpopular, will it be easy to restrict if we use it for
anonymous messages?
Not long ago on this list some people discussed possible changes to Usenet
involving the elimination of newsgroups and their replacement with a searching
system (ie. show me all articles with "cypherpunks" as a keyword).  Has this
gone anywhere?  I was thinking that this could be done in a way as to be
compatible with current implementations.  A server could be written which would
act like an nntp server if connected to on the nntp port, but which would work
differently internally.  When an nntp client makes a request regarding some
news group, say alt.anonymous.messages, the server would search its single,
unsorted pool of articles for all with "alt.anonymous.messages" in the
newsgroup field of the header and respond to the request.  Clients written for
the new server would have access to its enhanced features (whatever they end up
Although this does not have any direct crypto relevance, preserving Usenet as
an anonymous message pool seems like a good idea to me.  And to preserve it as
an anonymous message pool, it needs to be kept useful for its other uses. I'm
willing to work on this but I don't have the experience to lead an effort.  So,
is anyone interested or is anyone already working along these lines?

@_subject: My Departure, Moderation, and "Ownership of the List" 
I've been quiet about the moderation experiment (and I never posted
frequently anyway) but something Sandy wrote requires comment.  In
responding to Tim, Sandy points to the number of people on the censored
list as evidence of the acceptance of the filtering.  I am included in
that group and object to my silence being interpreted as support.
As Tim has pointed out, the bulk of the 2000 or so people who have
remained on the filtered list have never been active participants on the
list.  As we have never heard from them, we don't even know that they were
bothered by the flames and noise of the pre-filtered list.  And, even if
we did know, I don't think that there opinions should count as much as
those of the more active participants to the list.  A subscription to the
list does not make one a member of the Cypherpunks "community".  It is the
opinion of the members of the community and not the observers of it which
should matter.  (Even within the community, some people are more a part of
it than others, and nobody is more a part of it then Tim.)
As for the rest of us on the filtered list who are active (or occasionally
active) participants, our remaining on the list still can not be taken as
support for censorship.  Moderation of the list was announced as a one month experiment.  I didn't change my subscription from the filtered to
the unfiltered list because I expected this to end in a month and I was
willing to participate in the experiment.  You can't ask someone to try
something for a month to see if they like it and call there use of it in
that month evidence that they like it.
As long as I am writing, I may as well write the rest of my thoughts.  While
there was a period between the announcement of moderation and the start of
it during which people could (and did) comment on the change, the
announcement was clear that there would be moderation.  It was indeed a
fait accompli.  The moderated list should have been offered but not
imposed.  Then the experiment would have determined how many people
thought the list was so bad that they would seek moderation, rather than
determining how many thought moderation was so bad that they would seek to
avoid it.
Sandy, you said that you thought the list had improved since you began
moderating.  How could you think otherwise?  When you send an article to
the flames list its because you think the list would have been worse
otherwise.  I don't think the moderators opinion should be considered in
determining if moderation is a good thing.  I think there is a conflict of
interest there.
