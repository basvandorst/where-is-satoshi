@_subject: Acceptance of Keys 
As wary as I am of expressing my ignorance, I'll give it a shot...
I'm new to the Cypherpunks list and I'm just curious, is it going against the
principles of PGP to "accept keys from individuals whom are only electronically
known"?    (if so, I guess I'm in a state of stupor)
Most of my dealings on the internet are internet-exclusive, that is, I never
meet the people with whom I communicate.  With the exception of some locals,
computer social life in FL, USA is pretty non-existant.  I wish my
communications to be secure and I believe that PGP is the best way and I will
never have the opportunity to meet the people I talk to in Kansas or in New
York  (both places, I hope I never visit).
If meat-relations are the only secure way I'm supposed to communicate, then I
guess I'll have to use carrier pigeons.   :)
Of course, I could be taking this TOTALLY out of context, and in that case this
message should read:
Hey, I really like this list... It's intellectually stimulating and a clearly
positive influence on my life.  How's the weather in Europe?
I'm not trying to be argumentative, I just have serious questions about the
keeping of public keys...  here's another one... couldn't we assign one at
birth... it'd be better than a social security number (dunno what you use in
Europe), but a whole lot harder to remember...
ALSO:  We Mac users are wondering when MacPGP 2.1 will be out?  Anyone have any
contact info?
thanks for reading my words.
