Finally, a voice of reason.  The justice system must be followed by all
sides, not just the defendant.  While this is an important case, it's
important to see it in perspective.  The EFF and others have set themselves
up to provide defense in just such situations.  If you want to help them by
gathering "evidence", good for you.  But you aren't doing ANY good by
ranting on a Internet mail list.  We can all read the non-hysterical
informational postings to see what's happening.  Mr. Detweiler, you
are just adding noise and confusion.

Funny thing about some people on this list and alt.conspiracy,  the first
line of defense to accusations of hysteria is often "Look at what happened
to the Jews...".  The Jews didn't have professionals employed to fight for
their side of the argument, didn't have the justice system to provide a
legal framework within which both sides must maneuver, didn't have a
lot of what prz, et al., have.
You make my case.  "The attorneys".  What exactly are YOU doing with all
your yammering, besides making a loud noise?
