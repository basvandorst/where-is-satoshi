@_subject: [tor-relays] Call for discussion: turning funding into more 
I talked to Datacell roughly a year ago. They were fine with an exit
relay, but at the time were distracted by suing Visa. The only issue was pure cost. Traffic leaving Iceland costs a lot. I
wasn't prepared to spend ISK300,000 per month for a 100 mbps exit relay.
Maybe times have changed and traffic from Iceland is not so expensive

So far, there is one story where Eva claims the NSA can break tor
easily, see this Tor and HTTPS graphic as proof:
If your adversary is any rumored global passive adversary that can watch
and record the entire Internet at once, then you've probably already
lost the game.
At PETS in 2009[0], Paul did a talk on 'why I'm not an entropist' and
suggested that people need to start working on defeating a mythical
global passive adversary. Maybe in the near future some government will
have the capability of being the global passive adversary.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Server/host for Tor forum in Iceland or Norway? 
: I am interested in setting up a small Tor centric message board. Due to recent (and not so recent) events in U.S. Congress, E.U., and etc., I want to setup the message board in a country with strong -- and smart -- Internet privacy and security laws. As I understand matters, Iceland or Norway seem to be the best choices; is that correct? (I believe the Tor Project, or a group affiliated with them, uses servers in Iceland, but I could be mistaken)
I use servers in Iceland and did before I joined Tor. And yes,
torproject.is and tpo.is are both hosted with 1984.is. I also know
Mvrpur and Smari from 1984.is. My obvious endorsement is for 1984. They
are not the cheapest, but they are great.
Hosting relays in Iceland is expensive due to the current monopoly
arrangement on bandwidth and connections to Greenland and the
UK, see  If planning to host tor relays in Iceland,
talk to the provider first. If you do, ISK 50,000+ monthly bills shouldn't
shock you.
Here is the writeup of my last trip to Iceland for Tor,
