@_subject: CDR: Directed Hamiltonian path problem 
I am curious to know the maximum size of graphs than can be solved by      existing computers (electronic or DNA-based).
     Also, what would be the commercial fallout of finding an algorithm to      solve the Hamiltonian path problem rapidly for big graphs (500 points      and over) ?
     Thanks in advance,
