@_subject: SAFE Bill is a Disaster--"Use a cipher, go to prison" 
I'd like to point out that the key phrase in there seems to be "under any law in effect on the effective date of this chapter"  -- altho
it's gobbledegooked,
the intent seems to say "if there is no law in effect mandating GAK when
this bill becomes
law, there can never be a law passed which does"  Or in other words, it has
the effect of making
GAK no better, or worse, than under current law, while preventing passage
of GAK laws in the future.
