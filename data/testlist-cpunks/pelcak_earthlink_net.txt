@_subject: Akamai  
Most of the experience I have with Akamai is with them hosting high-traffic websites with geographically distributed servers.  I thought they had mostly gone bust, but it's possible they're still doing it.   A lot of websites a couple years ago talked about being "akamaized", meaning that they had their site hosted by akamai to allow for good server response time all around the country.

802.11b can be jammed very easily; simply by having an 802.11b card with a really powerful amplifier (just sniff the traffic and find which channel it's transmitting on, then transmit garbage at 50w).  Best to have regular ethernet backup channels in at least the most important cameras.  Of course someone would need prior knowledge of your system, but I think with the level of professionalism you're talking about we can assume a decent amount of time/effort put toward surveillance.
