Yes.  Adware.  Its cousin KaZaA (uses the same network) is spyware.
[Well, we don't know that for sure.  But it installs apparently ~5
different "phone home and get data" apps on your system.]
But of course, that's never stopped us before...

In article <20011128232318.A7944200 at exeter.ac.uk>,
But there's an unofficial, open-source Linux client also available:
An excerpt from the README:
                            WebSecure4Linux
This is a really simple, quick-and-dirty Linux client for the
Freedom(r) WebSecure service from Zero-Knowledge Systems.
(See  for more info.)
Note that you will need to sign up for the service by obtaining a
WebSecure activation code and creating a user account and password before
this client will operate.  Trial activation codes, available until the
end of January 2002, can be obtained from:
                   Activation codes are sent to your e-mail address. (Once your account has
been created, you might want to skip the client download.  Unless, of
course, you also run Windows.)
*** IMPORTANT ***
This is not supported by Zero-Knowledge Systems AT ALL; it's completely
unofficial.  You can try to get support at the SourceForge project
page: Right now, it supports http, and on linux 2.4, https as well.  It
shouldn't be hard to get the latter to work on 2.2 as well.
This program is covered by the GPL; see the file "COPYING" for details.
Some extra notes:
It's not feature-complete.  It doesn't manage your cookies, for example.
[The tricky bit is just that this code forks *a lot*, and you'd need to
put all the cookie info in persistent files, and put good locks around
all accesses to them.]
It's not speedy.  Your performance will suck.  It's written in perl,
and forks for each web connection.
It's not supported.  If it breaks, you get to keep both pieces.
Have fun!

Believe me, no one is more disappointed about this than I am, but right
now there simply isn't enough market buy-in on the premium services to
justify the network's operating costs. :-( As a business, we are focusing on the product that customers and
partners want. Here's an official Zero-Knowledge Systems statement on
the matter (note that this isn't the letter that was sent out; this is
something new):
    With the release of Freedom 3.0
    ( and
    the discontinuation of the Freedom Network (our anonymous browsing
    and encrypted pseudonym service) there have been a number of
    questions for more details about the decision to stop offering the
    Freedom Network services.  Hopefully this will help clarify things.
    When we released Freedom 1.0 close to 2 years ago we saw a
    significant percentage of our users subscribe to the premium Freedom
    Network services.  This was anticipated as our early adopters were
    very privacy and technology aware and had expressed strong interest
    in the Freedom Network offering.
    As we began to increase the distribution of Freedom into the mass
    market with the release of Freedom 2.0 & 2.2, we saw a
    disproportionately high percentage of users who subscribed to the
    standard features (and not Freedom Network services).    The initial
    interest in the premium (FN) services amongst our early adopters
    simply didn't carry over to the mainstream and as our user numbers
    grew, we began to realize that the market was looking for the kind
    of features we are now offering in Freedom 3.0.
    As we began our feature triage for Freedom 3.0 (almost 9 months ago)
    we heard from customers and focus groups of users, as well as
    channel partners (i.e.
     and
    reflected on the statistics from our existing user base, and decided
    that there was not enough mass market demand for the premium
    services to justify continuing the service.
    This was entirely a market related decision.    The market demand
    for consumer Internet security and safety tools has grown
    considerably in the 4 years our company has been in business.
    Freedom 3.0 is a strong competitor to security offerings from
    companies such as Symantec and McAfee and we have gotten very
    positive market support and a warm reception from channel partners
    to this new version of our suite of privacy and security tools.
    There has been speculation that this decision was somehow related to
    government pressure or was made in the wake of the tragedies of
    September 11.   This is simply untrue.   For the past 3 months we
    have been beta-testing this version with partners, getting
    certification from Microsoft for our drivers and completing our
    Alpha and Beta cycles with our beta users.    Support for the
    Freedom network offering was removed from the client code base well
    before the recent tragedies of September 11.
    Our research team is continuing work in the area of privacy enhanced
    network protocols, and we are open to any suggestions the research
    community offers on how we can leverage the work that went into the
    Freedom Network design and operation to advance this area of
    computer science.    If you have suggestions or interest in this,
    please contact us at mailto:corporate at zeroknowledge.com
    Zero-Knowledge continues to offer our consumer protection utility
    Freedom 3.0 and we are very excited by the prospects for this
    product.  We also have a division that is addressing the market need
    of enterprise privacy technologies that stem from managing consumer
    data that require strong security and policy frameworks to adhere to
    privacy regulations and customer preference management (Healthcare;
    Financial and other consumer data that is subject to new security,
    privacy restrictions relating to legislation like HIPAA, GLB,
    PIPEDA, EU privacy directive).
    Our company continues to evolve and focus our efforts on market
    needs and customer demands and we remain very confident of our
    prospects in these markets.
