If the jury isn't persuaded betond reasonable doubt that you were in genuine apprehension of serious harm
to yourself or your family--not your property--then
you will be acquitted of using violence to repel an
intruder into your home.  Maybe not your south 40,
but your home.  Indeed, if the local prosecutor or US Atty believes,
on the positive side, that your actions were reasonable,
you probably won't even be charged.  Now, that doesn't of itself make deadly force right,
but as I'm just through with cleaning two shotguns
(dove season here, going again Friday), I'm not going to argue the point too vigorously.  I'd say the morality of such situations, leaving aside the legality, is extremely fact-intensive.

Most folks would, today, but this was not always a given in our

Perhaps so, but that says nothing about the federal gov't enforcing the First Amendment to the US Constitution against

Well, quite a bit actually, as interpreted by the SCt.  It makes

Nowhere. The SCt just said it did.
Because it applies to "this constitution" which addresses, in 1A

advantage.  And the locals are often revenue-starved and constantly in search of new tax base, constantly.  Thus,
what's easy for the feds to say ("no new taxes" read my

impact on federal revenue, no sacrifice, no altruism, except at the expense of other potential, and hungry taxing authorities.  Magaziner didn't earn any points with

Is one of the questions, whether we have right to take steps
to protect our "transactional" privacy?  The Brandeis and Warren
"right to be left alone" shares a connection with property rights
and has more than a nodding acquaintance with Fourth and Fifth
Amendment concepts--there's not much utility in a right to be
left alone if you have no place to be alone or if others can
enter your place/space at will.
Off your space ("in public") you can usually be observed; much
of the complaining in the past couple of decades is about the
increasingly sophisticated, even automated, means of observation
and recording, not about the fact that if you enter a premise
(say, a website:)) you can be seen and overheard by other people.
It seems to me this is a question of degree, and not a threat
to some pre-existing right to remain anonymous and "unseen"
in public. In other words, is there a right to forbid others
from trying to observe you in public, especially in places
where those others have an equal (or greater) right to be?
So the question may be not whether we can prohibit others from
doing so, by right, but whether we have right to attempt peacefully to *prevent* them from doing so?  I.e., can the gov't forbid us from trying to protect our privacy by avaliable
means, say, crypto?

Well, this may merely point up the fact that next to
government--or perhaps more than gov't--the greatest
threat to privacy is the existence of a free press.
That trade-off may be simple, but "simple-minded" seems
a little strongly put.
As for Posner, who's often good for a laugh, particularly when taken out of context, his point so often reduces to
a simple one itself: Which is easier (cheaper, more efficient,
etc.), law or the market?  Given that perfection in markets,
as in golf and most other things, is unattainable, sometimes
we shall have to resort to law, as in the "negotiating with the

Again we have one of those few occasions in which Tim and I are in perfect agreement.  To require gun ownership just because "arms" or "militia" is in the Constitution makes
as much sense as requiring us all to have a press just
because "press" is in the Constitution.
Now to the second point, police power regulation by states,
implicitly cited below.  We settled in the Civil War the question
of whether States get to arm themselves against invasion.  They
don't. I have no doubt the same holds true for municipalities.
The "common defense" is a national defense. A State has no authority
to require you to keep or bear arms.

Use your head. One of the first things Bush does is pardon Bill
Clinton.  After all, given who's in charge of the prosecution,
if Gore gets elected Clinton gets prosecuted so the Repubs can keep
that circus going; if Bush gets elected, it's not only no longer
important, it looks vindictive, which is inconsistent with the compassionate conservatism we've been hearing less and less about lately and with "turning this country around", whatever that meant.
So Bush pardons Clinton, which has the added plus of forcing Clinton
to the choice of taking it or not.  That's *real* revenge.  Not that

Speaking as a lawyer, one of "they,", they should not continue to use
it.  Identity theft might be accomplishable in some scenario, one in which
I somehow induced amnesia in you, for example, but otherwise the use of
the term to cover what you rightly point is simply impersonation, does a
disservice to my profession as well as yours.
As to "prevent," it seems to me that Random House has the better of
Merriam-Webster here.  Apparently what M-W really means in their first sense of the word is a combination, something like "anticipate
and take measures to forestall or render impossible." Now, the anticipation may be brief, and the measures spontaneous, but that's
what I gather they really wanted to say at M-W. If so, they're loading
more on to "prevent" than it always has to carry.

Oh and as to non-repudiation and lawyers throwing that term around loosely:  Most lawyers would probably tell you that,
for their purposes, whatever the parties *agree* to be non-repudiation *is* non-repudiation as between *them*. The hard cases are the ones where there's no agreement and the law must supply a default rule, or derive a rule from
the conduct of the parties.  Those are the instances you have in mind, I take it. In such cases, where "course of dealing" and "course of performance" between the parties
sheds little or no light, the law often looks to "trade
usage."  To which the work of punks, among others, may
be relevant.

there is a respectable--note I do not say persuasive,
as I don't have enough facts--that Kissinger as a
"subordinate" was carrying out the policy of the state and, as such an actor, may be clothed with sovereign immunity.  This is not an uncomplicated area of the law, and is
one that gets very deep very fast.  It's also one of
those areas where the law is about as far divorced from

Lotta differences here which I know you're aware of, but don't seem to choose to remember at the moment. In the first place, prior restraint does have its after-the-fact-restraint analog in the "chilling effect"
doctrine--not it's not absolute, as prior restraint law almost is, but
it usually goes to accomplish the same purpose. Obscenity is not protected speech, so the 1A's irrelevant there, as
far as the courts go and as far as your argument goes, because you're arguing about what the law might do. The same is true of libel and
slander, if you can find any such thing under today's prevailing
1a jurisprudence.  They're pretty few and far between torts in the
last thirty years. Your examples about drugs and abortion are not examles of prohibited
speech but of compelled speech, which is another subject altogether,
though one which I would agree has its constitutional issues as well, but
not the ones you have in mind above: Unless you advocate a right to commit fraud under the First Amendment, which I have not previously heard you do. There will be a repressive response by some--Trent Lott is already
trashing civil liberties, I shit you not, as of today, as having to
take a second place to security needs in ths "war"--but the thing to do
is resist this kind of chuck-headed thinking with the First Amendment.
And the Fifth, and the Fourth.  They usually work, so give them a chance first.
