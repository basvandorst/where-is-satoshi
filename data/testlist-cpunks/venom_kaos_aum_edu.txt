I am also a touch typist and have not problems typing long passphrases with echo off.  I was also wondering about this discussion.  I can type a long passphrase with little trouble.

I must say that I agree here.  I don't think that he can stop him from making any modifications to PGP, but I think that he can stop him from using the name PGP on it.  I think that he has every right to do this.  PGP is tied very closely with his reputation and that any modifications released under the name PGP should be his and his alone.                  :.     .        ,o88o,
