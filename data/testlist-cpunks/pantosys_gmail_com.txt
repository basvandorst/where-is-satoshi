Although I haven't looked at the code behind stegedetect yet, I can
assume that a single dedicated processor would be less efficient that
perhaps two or three dedicated processors. Some steg (appendx,
camouflage) isn't steg, just data appended to the end of the file, in
valid jpeg encapsulation. Real steg (f5, jsteg, jphide,  steghide)
would require looking at more data, for more time. it would be a waste
to have the same processor working on appended data and real steg.
Quick answer: I don't know / Depends on the data.
Again, you'd have to decide between real and fake steg. Appending a
fortune message to the end of an image would be really quick, and
would alert stegedetect. But if you want to signal the nsa, you'd need
real steg with real (but breakable) crypto. The difference is quick
perl script versus a modified jpeg library.

I told him to how to find his answers and to try finding us. Let's
hope he's actually motivated.
