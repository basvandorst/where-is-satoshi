@_subject: hello...i applied for your job... 
Hello. My name is Olga Dunayev and I applied for your job like 2 weeks ago and I payed with a money order, and I was wondering why I never started the job. Wasn't I suppose to start with the job right away? My home adress is 1769 Paso Real Ave. Rowland Heights, Ca. 91748. Please write to me and tell me why I never started. Thank you very much.
