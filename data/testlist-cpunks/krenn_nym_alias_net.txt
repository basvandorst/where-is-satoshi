@_subject: Snake-Oil FAQ 
It would be nice to have a list of actual products which are deemed
potential snake-oil. Such a list could be maintained anonymously
through a nym to avoid all the annoying legal problems with commenting
on another's product. Though truth is the best defense against libel
charges, it would be very annoying to be sued or some such by some
hairbrained snake-oil peddler.

I agree, hence my original post. I for one would not contribute to such
a list without anonymity, tho my critiques might be right. The hassle of
dealing with a person or organization bent on causing you legal headache
is more than I am willing to deal with. It is obvious, given the current state of the legal system in this country, that a lawsuit against a
even a well-respected cryptographer might drag on for some time, costing ennumerable dollars and hours, and _might_ even succeed.

No, you're not real smart. The source code is _provided_ with PGP. If
you are paranoid, _read_ it.

@_subject: Airport security [no such thing] 
I have had the same experience. I am sure that removing all components of
the laptop not required for its functioning would yield a significant amount
of room inside, especially for larger (non-"notebook") machines. I'm not
an expert on explosives, but I would imagine a laptop-full of whatever could
be pretty nasty. Someone with determination could even make it look like
it had a floppy, a CDROM, etc, just by replacing the devices themselves with
facades. Not that the airport security would notice, but anyway.
But wait - won't the all-important "did you pack your bags yourself" and
"did anyone give you bags to take on the plane" stop them? ;-)
It just obviates the fact that airport security is really useless against
a determined attacker, but manages to be extremely annoying to everyone else.
