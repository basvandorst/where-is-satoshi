Since you are publicly accusing Carol Anne of "breach of our AUP", you
better explain what horrible crime she committed.

Looking at the groups that you cross-posted, I sure as heck would like to know what she did to get kicked off?;) What the heck do you have to apologize for Mike? Unless you might of been involved too?;) I told you
you've been working too hard.
Come on now bud, give us the lowdown!
