Ya won't have complete equity amongst lobbyists, until ya remove the power of bureaucrats to control people's lives. When laws can be used to deprive people of their livelihood, via either taxation or regulation, you will create situations where people can make money from it, and therefore unscrupulous people will take advantage. The only defensible argument for government at all is to protect people from depredation, either from fellow citizens or from external threats. When you prevent people from engaging in peaceful commerce, you open the floodgates to tyranny. Thus, the solution is less government, not to try to legislate human nature.
[speaking for myself, of course]

Not to sound like a dupe or anything, but every time I get discouraged
at the rampant mealyism of our political system I go read the first
couple of paragraphs of a text from GOVT 101.  There, I get reminded that
the way most political debate is handled elsewhere is with bullets.
Personally, I welcome a complete equity between all lobbyists seeking to
obtain a politico's ear.  Take the money out of the equation, and let the
merits of their causes, if any, stand on their own. Happy holidays,
