There are a lot of news stories about the law which allows Illinois
schools to demand students' passwords. Many of the stories incorrectly
implicate a new anti-cyberbullying law. The law which allows schools to
demand student passwords is a different law that was passed in 2013.

@_subject: Soghoian on Government Funding Crypto 
To calm fears and help make people less paranoid of government
financing, Soghoian wrote a beautiful tweet that I felt obliged to share.
"Christopher Soghoian ‏
Yes, the US government tortures, spies and assassinates, but sometimes
it supports pretty awesome things, like usable crypto apps.
7:28 AM - 3 Mar 2015"
If you are thoroughly impressed by Soghoian's tweet, then you may want
to read his interview on Democracy Now.

If you receive a Glomar response to a FOIA request, you can use that to
file a Mandatory Declassification Review (MDR). You can request for the
records to be declassified and challenge the classification.
You have to make sure that you follow the correct procedure and appeal
to the ISCAP board in time.
Info on MDR appeals
Info on MDR
The NSA Archive has experience in filing MDRs
On a side note, the US Navy, for months, lost my FOIA request about Tor
and the Navy finally transferred the request to the correct
department...where it continues to languish.

@_subject: FOIA/Public Records Event and Livestream 
There is an event in DC about the Freedom of Information Act on March
13, 2015.  There is also supposed to be a livestream of the conference
for anyone to watch online.
The Freedom of Information Act can be used by anyone to request records
from the US federal government. Many states and countries also have
their own public records laws which can be very useful for journalists
and researchers.

@_subject: NIST - Cybersecurity in a Post-Quantum World 
"The advent of practical quantum computing will break all commonly used
public key cryptographic algorithms. In response, NIST is researching
cryptographic algorithms for public key-based key agreement and digital
signatures that are not susceptible to cryptanalysis by quantum
algorithms." - NIST.
Workshop April 2-3, 2015 at NIST campus in Gaithersburg, Maryland (near DC).
my questions -
What deciphering and decryption capabilities does the US government
already have?
How long until encryption we use today becomes obsolete? Is it already
Will there be a situation where the US government and large corporations
have quantum computers capable of deciphering today's encryption
standards, but average consumers would not have access to quantum
encryption? What would the impact be on mass surveillance and privacy
