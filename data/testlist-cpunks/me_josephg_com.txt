They don't care about us. Australia has banned guns. If you work
really hard at it you can still get a gun in australia, but its really
inconvenient. Simply making guns inconvenient has resulted in far
fewer gun-related crimes. They'll never get the last 1% of guns out of
people's hands, but it turns out they don't actually need to.
Crypto is going to be the same - lets be honest here - if Apple,
Google and Facebook are prevented from providing good security out of
the box, how many people will take the extra steps to install and use
Signal? The government doesn't care about *us*. They care about making
sure the remaining 99% of citizens are monitored.

Its amazing NRA propaganda still manages to rewrite the history on the
story on the ground here. You just don't see guns in Australia. I
don't know anyone who has one. I'd never seen a gun be drawn or fired
in real life before I moved to the USA. (Source: I've lived in
Australia for 30 years)
  While the impact of the Australian gun laws is still debated, there
have been large decreases in the number of firearm suicides and the
number of firearm homicides in Australia. Homicide rates in Australia
are only 1.2 per 100,000 people, with less than 15% of these resulting
from firearms.
  Prior to the implementation of the gun laws, 112 people were killed
in 11 mass shootings. Since the implementation of the gun laws, no
comparable gun massacres have occurred in Australia.
  Remarkably, American pro-gun advocates try to use the impact of the
Australian gun law reform to make a case that reform “doesn’t work”.
This seems amazing given the homicide rate in the United States is
five per 100,000 people, with most homicides involving firearms.
  "From 1996 to 2003, the total number of gun deaths each year fell
from 521 to 289, suggesting that the removal of more than 700,000 guns
was associated with a faster declining rate of gun suicide and gun
  By 2002/03, Australia's rate of 0.27 firearm-related homicides per
100,000 population had dropped to one-fifteenth that of the United

Yeah I've lived in Sydney most of my life.
But this goes back to my original point - despite lots of guns being
quietly hidden around the place, most crimes still don't use them! Which is
not at all an obvious outcome. It implies that most crimes aren't well
planned and premeditated, and that simply making something *inconvenient*
goes a long way toward banning it, even if people have strong incentives to
overcome the inconvenience.
We've seen exactly this with crypto too. Industry grade crypto has existed
for years, but things like PGP being simply *inconvenient* has resulted in
it having virtually no adoption. The big threat to pervasive surveillance
isn't pgp, its companies like apple and whatsapp bringing that technology
to the masses. The UK government only has to outlaw the big players
implementing decent crypto, and 90%+ of communications will still be
visible to surveillance. Even amongst criminals.
We should be worried, but this isn't a play for us.

Snowden: “Encryption works. Properly implemented strong crypto systems
are one of the few things that you can rely on.". And yet even most
email on this list isn't encrypted.
The cat and mouse game of security is fun and technically challenging.
But if you want to actually stop global attackers like the NSA, the
problem isn't that we don't have good enough crypto. Its that barely
anybody in our community also knows how to make pleasant, usable
software. We need more software like Signal (TextSecure). Not because
of its rad ratcheting OTR, but because I can get my partners to use it
without having to spend an hour explaining asymmetric key cryptography

Got anything more recent than July 2014? Apple has been claiming far
and wide that from iOS 8 even they cannot access the data stored on a
locked device without a password:
All three APIs listed in that readwrite article require access to
services via USB, which require a device the phone trusts and (I
think) for the device to be unlocked. I would be quite surprised if it
turned out that apple really can decrypt data for the government on
locked devices. They've been quite public about this policy, and
they've claimed they can't access said data under oath. Its also a
fantastic strategic move for them to fight off android - given
google's business model it'll be impossible for android to follow
I am about 90-95% confident that there aren't any intentional holes in
iOS through which apple can read data thats only stored on my device.
(I recently switched from android to iOS for this reason.)
It was very impressive for its time but what impact has PGP *actually*
made? You seem like a sufficiently paranoid human who knows about PGP,
knows what it does and you're technically capable of installing it and
using it. So tell me - how many encrypted emails do you send and
receive with PGP?
I think PGP's legacy is that it started a conversation around crypto
and privacy. But as a *product* it was a complete failure. I mean, it
doesn't even protect metadata.

Even if thats all true, its still also true that nobody is using PGP.
Its easier to make a slick UI than convince people to do work. Is it
so much to ask that people who make software try to make life easy for
their users?
For all your talk of doing hard work oshwm, it looks like you only
created that PGP key yesterday:
$ gpg --list-packets signature.asc
hashed subpkt 2 len 4 (sig created 2015-11-08) [...]
And as far as I can tell it hasn't been signed by anyone. At least I
think so - after 15 minutes fighting with gpg I still can't find your
actual key and I ran out of care.
... Which leads me into my second point, which is that here in 2015
PGP is a terrible technical solution. It doesn't encrypt metadata
(which is a non-starter these days - who you communicate with is some
of the *most* valuable personal data for the NSA). It also leaks
information about who signed your key. That means either:
- Your key gets signed by your friends, so now your friend network public
- Emails with PGP are provably from you, in a way that can be traced
back to physically witnessed government ID.
... Or both! Personally I would rather the possibility of forgery than
either of those outcomes.
