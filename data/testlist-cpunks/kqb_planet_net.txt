This raises an intriguing possibility that I am sure is _not_
intended by the regulators.  If the cash is cheap enough, perhaps
it could be an economical carrier of encrypted messages.  What I have
in mind is somewhat analogous to papering your wall with dollar bills,
which clearly is uneconomical unless the dollar bills are really cheap.
What does it take to set up an offshore "remailer bank"?  Of course,
the digital cash it uses must be very INefficient, chock full of bit
bloat that hosts plenty of not-so-subliminal channels. 8-)
