@_subject: D-H telnet protocol  *  Cheap secure phones 
Fine, Perry.  You do it.  I want to get some "easy" protection out
there now.  Easy often turns out to be six months of work all by itself.
This is the intent.  The D-H protocol will not reveal any identifying
information, and the rest of what is transacted will be protected under
the secret key produced by the D-H protocol.
There's a "CELP" standard for voice encoding which you can get from
the Feds.  They used it as an upgrade in STU-III secure phones.  It's
Federal Standard 1016.  It encodes voice at 4800 bits per second with
better quality than any known algorithm under 16,000 bits per second
(so says the paper on it).  If you give it 16 kbits/sec, it is "toll
You can get a free copy of the standard, a "technical information
bulletin 92-1" entitled "Details to Assist in Implementation of Fed
Standard 1016 CELP", and four floppies full of C and Fortran software
that implements it, plus test cases, by requesting it from:
Note that this C and Fortran code doesn't run in realtime on workstations;
it requires a DSP.  But as the "Implementation Details" paper says:
