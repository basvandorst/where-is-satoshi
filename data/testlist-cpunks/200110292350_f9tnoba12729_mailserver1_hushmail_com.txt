@_subject: Ashcroft prepares for martial law 
Unlike America's Most Wanted the new dire but vague warnings are unlikely to cause citizens to uncover a massive new plot, I doubt they would have uncovered the 911 even if predictions of impending trouble have been announced a few days prior.  Since Congress gave him virtually everything he asked for the next step is martial law, though how that might help uncover any new plots is beyond me.
