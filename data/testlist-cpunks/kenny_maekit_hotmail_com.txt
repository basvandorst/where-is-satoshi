@_subject: The meek will inherit what, exactly? 
"Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth."
"The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun."   - Ecclesiastes I, verse 9
your statement is not so new.  even the Bible itself gives phrophecy about the destruction of the world.  so, those who lived in the 'old days' were not really (or did not need to be) ignorant concerning the destruction which would befall the earth.
of course, the catch is to recognize/accept the new jerusalem as the inheritance of the "redeemed".

@_subject: Taxes on hard drives 
not true.  in fact, i would argue that the difficulty of finding good music is widespread throughout the states.
i attribute this to the clueless, braindead fools who are governed by the radio...and we all know the stupidity of the people who control the radio yet, go to just about any country in europe (i say europe because my firsthand knowledge is limited) and you can easily find just about anything you want.  i have far better luck finding many american bands in europe than in america.  why?  because many albums are simply not _released_ in america.   a lot of albums that are released in america are released in europe first (even american bands).  then again, just listen to european radio.

of course, there is a cynical side of me which says...hey, let 'em legalize it.  i mean, come on...do you really think the law against assassinations has ever stopped them?  did you know that gullible is not even in the dictionary?  at least if they legalize it we won't have to listen to the news and KNOW that a patsy was shamelessly used by those in power.  we won't have to sit by and watch the government execute "justice" on those who have been used.

@_subject: G8, issues, and familiarity 
if only that were the case.  the exact opposite has already taken place.  the protesting has done nothing more than take the focus off of the g8 talks and place it upon the riots/rioters.  the g8 talks would have only been briefly mentioned in the media if there had been not rioting to sensationalize it.  the riots only allow the reporters to give the public something that they will want to watch (read death, destruction, and Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at
