@_subject: WANTED: Tolerant, anonymity-friendly news admins 
Because of recent attacks on the remailer network and mail2news
gateways, I may loose access to at least one of the news servers I
currently feed news to from my mail2news gateway.
If you are a news administrator, believe in free speech and anonymity,
and you would like to help the cause, please consider giving transfer
(aka "IHAVE" or "hosts.nntp") privileges to this machine.  You will
not be the only server, and so do not need to worry about being the
point of entrance of mail2news articles to Usenet.
Please contact me if you can help.  Thank you.
For those who oppose the existence of mail2news gateways, you should
know that we are taking steps to limit the abuse.  However, doing so
without in any way limiting articles that abide by the usage policy is
tricky, and must be done carefully.  Please be patient.
