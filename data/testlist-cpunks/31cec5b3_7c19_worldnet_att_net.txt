AT&T WorldNet service has banned the sending of anonymous email or
posting anonymously.
The no anon rule even beat the no indecency rule, which is second:
                which is libelous, defamatory or which discloses
                private or personal matters concerning any person.
                Members may not post or transmit any message,
                data, image or program which is indecent, obscene
                or pornographic.
