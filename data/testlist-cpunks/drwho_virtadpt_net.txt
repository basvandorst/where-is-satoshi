This means that the batman-adv.ko module the Serval software package
includes will be installed and configurable.  It is a good mesh
routing protocol to use - it works well in our experience.
Also, if the manufacturer of the phone (or third-party firmware
installed on the phone) permits it.  Android v2.1 packaged by HTC is
dodgy at best in this respect.
Nice.  Thank you for the link.
No, and my statement was slightly incorrect.  Let me see if I can
clarify (read: have I had enough coffee this morning?):
Laptops and netbooks that are capable of booting from a USB key or
(wi-fi enabled mobile devices) can then make use of the mesh without
having to install anything extra.  In this way, minimally flexible
devices can be used with a minimum of hassle, while maximally flexible
devices (general purpose computers) can be used as both infrastructure
and client (due to the include desktop (KDE v3.5) and applications).
Plans to do so (including a meta-package for Debian) are on the
drawing board, but we want to get to at least beta before moving
forward on this.
It is also my understanding that the technology that will be used by
the Freedombox for configuration and control is very similar to that
which we are using for Byzantium Linux (Python and CherryPy, though
the templating libraries we use differ).
That will likely be unnecessary.  At least insofar as third party
router firmware is concerned (namely, dd-wrt), packages for mesh
routing software are already available and usable.  Our early tests
involved .apks of BATMAN and OLSR that 'just worked'.  We are
considering including .apk files for mesh routing protocols for the
top two or three opensource routing distributions in the Byzantium
library but again, we want to release a beta before moving forward on
Ideas for this are also on the drawing board.  Whether or not
appropriate jailbreaking methods will have to be included remains to
be seen.

A few times.  It doesn't play well with multiple layers of NAT, and it
doesn't seem to be compatible with some of the experiments we want to
run in the near future.  Plus, it's drawing a certain amount of heat
in Germany, which implies that other countries will be paying closer
attention to it.  Trying to explain that we're using RetroShare for
its distributed forum capability rather than piracy is probably not
going to be believed.
As I understand it, RetroShare uses your current public IP to contact
other current public IPs.  It uses PGP public keys for authentication
and encryption, and tying those to IP addresses that ISPs can use to
ID people may not be something some of us are interested in doing.
I'd rather consider the folks who are not okay with this
preferentially because the reverse can alienate people (I've lost a
few good friends that way, and learned that lesson the hard way).
Those are things I'd taken into account.
Thank you.  I hope it's feasible; I plan on starting experimentation

Looking at the illegal bit first, if somewhere is in bad enough shape
that you have to set up a guerilla communications network to assist in
disaster relief, chances are you've got a pretty good leg to stand on.
 IANAL, call your own,  That said, it's something a few of us have worked on.  There are a
couple of drones that are relatively low cost (most of them
quadcopters) that appear to have enough lift to transport small mesh
nodes for short distances and perch someplace to conserve motor power.
 The 3d printed quadcopters that Telecomix were examining might work
for this purpose ( To my
knowledge, we haven't examined this one
( closely because I haven't had
time to spend on HacDC's 3D printers.
For both models, the possibility of using hacked Android devices for
the network nodes themselves came up a number of times.  There is also
a hacker working on porting Byzantium Linux to the ARM platform,
because he wants to try it on the RaspberryPi.  We don't know where
he's at with that project right now.
It should also be relatively easy to repurpose a more conventional
model craft (like the toy quadcopters resembling Thingiverse entry
 above) into mobility platforms for mesh nodes.  So long as the
network node had sufficient power (I kind of like the idea of the
solar charger in an envelope kits that were going around at HOPE9 - I
forget who manufactured them but they're cheap and designed to be used
as trickle chargers) for wireless and the motors of the drone could be
shut down to conserve their power cells, the keys would be positioning
and stability of perch.

@_subject: [HacDC:Byzantium] October development sprint. 
Hash: SHA1
I know this list has been quiet since we got back from IS4CWM.  We're
still alive but swamped in our day jobs.
The question is, will there be a Byzantium development sprint in
October.  The answer is, I don't know.
Speaking only for myself, I'm exhausted, physically and emotionally.
My day job has been running me flat out since I got back to the States
and if I don't get some downtime I'm going to fall over.  Everyone
else is likely in a different position right now.
One of the things we're looking at is UCI
( a framework for system
configuration that is meant to be used under the hood of other things
(for example, the control panel application LuCI).  Haxwithaxe, as I
recall, is working on a Python API for it that would make it easier to
work with.  We might be able to leverage it to do the actual work of
configuring stuff for us (like starting and stopping services and
configuring the network interfaces) so we won't have to write code to
do that ourselves.  We got it to compile outside of a firmware environment on our laptops, so we know it's doable.
One of the things that we were debating while in Spain was the
direction the UI should go in.  There is a rewrite of the 'panel in
the works but it isn't done yet.  There is also a matter of the
sustainability of the control panel as a whole, which was brought to
light after talking shop with the Freifunk, Guifi, and Commotion
Wireless folks.  They're not having any trouble using LuCI to do what
they need to do, and I'm all for having one less piece of code to
maintain so energy can be spent on other aspects of Byzantium Linux.
We also discussed the possibility of migraing to LuCI
( so we don't have to maintain a
control panel, it's done for us.  We know that we can get it to
compile on non- firmware, we've done it.  The question is, is
it worth migrating to it?  Can we migrate to it without having to
rewrite a lot of it?  Can we write the modules we need easily?  Could
LuCI do the job of automagically configuring a node when it starts up?
Another possibility is a Python module called sh
( which exposes any and all shell
commands to Python code.  that stands to make things a lot easier.  So
does the Python module Wifi ( for that
matter, though in more specialized fashion.  The Python sh module is
already in the Git repo and the wifi module can be added, so building
packages and making use of them shouldn't be hard.
Something else we're kicking around is splitting some code off into a
daemon that runs in the background and configures everything on
bootup.  When the node first comes online it detects network
interfaces and configures them appropriately to set up a Byzantium
mesh node, and then when the control panel is actually accesses, it
will have a configuration all ready to display and possibly alter, but
by and large it'll be online and routing traffic.
We've also been doing some experimenting with different applications
for the messaging framework.  During the last sprint we set up
ejabberd nodes on our laptops and they worked as expected, but one of
the things we're uncertain of is whether or not a MUC (multi-user
chat) XMPP channel can be automatically distributed across all nodes
without their being clustered ahead of time (which is fairly tricky
with ejabberd, but might not be with, say, python-xmpp-server
(  If anyone
knows for sure, please reply to this, we'd love to know if we should
persue this avenue or not.
We also did some experimenting with Litter
( which is a truly distributed
workalike for Twitter designed for non-NATted networks that is
stupidly, brilliantly simple and good at what it does.  Every Litter
instance is a single instance, and IP multicast is used to broadcast
JSON messages to every other instance on the same multicast group that
it can reach (IP multicast address 239.192.1.100).  It listens on port
8080 so it's accessed with a web browser (the UI is entirely in
JQuery).  It uses SQLite for a back end, and all it does is listen for
new posts, see if they're in the local database, and if not drop them
into the right place in the timeline with a gap filling algorithm.  We
could use it (or more likely, something working along the same lines)
for the microblog/realtime chat application for the Byzantium mesh.
We also did some playing with Tahoe-LAFS but got mixed results.  I
couldn't get it going on any of my machines, but Haxwithaxe and Sitwon
did.  I'd like to give it another try to see what happens.
Anyone else?  Status reports?  New ideas?  Suggestions?  We really
need to have a sprint this month?

Welcome to the Byzantium list!
The last time Byzantium Linux was used in an emergency situation was
during the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in New York City.  We built a
version of Byzantium specifically for the use case of restoring
connectivity to the rest of the global Net if there was a gateway
because responders were encountering great difficulties coordinating
with one another and with external organizations.
We learned a lot of things there, chief among them that rapid
deployment is essential.  Sandy was the reason we built an
autoconfiguration daemon which pretty much takes the user out of the
loop insofar as configuring a Byzantium node is concerned, which frees
them up to do other things (like clearing out wreckage).
Unfortunately, we also learned the hard way that you can't necessarily
count on assistance from people during a disaster situation.  There
was an organization up there that promised assistance (in the form of
computers that could be used as Byzantium nodes) that changed their
mind at the last minute, which forced us to fall back on a backup
plan.  What we took away from this was that interoperability with
other mesh projects is essential, so we added interoperability with
the Commotion Wireless project while we were up there (and got it
working on the first try).  Since that time, we've been working with
other wireless network projects on automatic, transparent

connectivity and not specific services, so we removed a lot of things
from this release to facilitate that.

lot of people off.  They just don't want to put in the effort "to sit

the (largely correct) perception that amateur radio equipment is very
expensive.  A lot of it is.  HT's (hand-held portable units) are much
less expensive (and getting cheaper - thank you, Baofeng) but the
common response is still "I don't want to sit around studying when I
could just talk on the phone."
One definitely has to put in much less work up front to be allowed to

any specific questions pertaining to amateur radio and wi-fi (because
there is a bit of overlap)?
That may be why so many community wireless projects in the States draw
fire from telecom companies, but that's a rant for another mailing

Hash: SHA1
ANNOUNCING BYZANTIUM LINUX V0.3a (Beach Cat)
Approved for: GENERAL RELEASE, DISTRIBUTION UNLIMITED
NOTE: This is Byzantium Linux for x86-compatible laptops and desktops.
This release is not compatible with the Raspberry Pi.  We just started
work on that port.
Project Byzantium, a working group of HacDC ( is
proud to announce the release of v0.3 alpha of Byzantium Linux, a live
distribution of Linux which makes it fast and easy to construct an
ad-hoc wireless mesh network which can augment or replace the current
telecommunications infrastructure in the event that it is knocked
offline (for example, due to a natural disaster) or rendered
untrustworthy (through widespread surveillance or disconnection by
hostile entities).  Byzantium Linux is designed to run on any x86
computer with at least one 802.11 a/b/g/n wireless interface.
Byzantium can be burned to a CD- or DVD-ROM (the .iso image is around
372 megabytes in size), booted from an external hard drive, or can
even be installed in parallel with an existing operating system
without risk to the user's data and software.  Byzantium Linux will
act as a node of the mesh and will automatically connect to other mesh
nodes and act as an access point for wifi-enabled mobile devices.
This release is unique because it is based upon the work we did in New
York City in the weeks following Hurricane Sandy in late 2012.  We
were asked by FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) to help
restore the telecommunications network in the neighborhood of Red
Hook, and the design requirements were dictated by the needs of the
community as described by leaders and elders.  v0.3a constitutes a
formalization of those requirements rather than the ad-hoc build we
deployed in Red Hook.
THIS IS AN ALPHA RELEASE!  Do NOT expect Byzantium to be perfect.
Some features are not ready yet, others need work.  Things are going
to break in weird ways and we need to know what those ways are so we
can fix them.  Please, for the love of LOLcats, do not deploy
Byzantium in situations where lives are at stake.

I've been playing with one of these for a while with one of my netbooks:
By default, the firmware running in the on-board microcontroller
records the time between three successive hits on the 'tube (t1, t2,
t3).  If (t2 - t1) < (t3 - t2), it prints a 0 to the serial port,
else, it prints a 1 to the serial port.  Hardly high resolution
entropy, but it can be stirred into an entropy pool.  New firmware
can, of course, be developed using the existing C code as a base.  I'm
not entirely certain how helpful or useful it is (I have my doubts, to
be honest), but if nothing else it's given me cause to do some reading
up and try a few small scale experiments.

DLP (data loss prevention) products usually have MITM capability, to

some companies have full packet capture policies.  The technology is

You are correct in that the incentive to carry out MITM attacks in

There are ways to make it more scalable but I don't think perfectly
so.  The question is, are 21st century people more willing to use a
"send it and it'll get there" method ala the Net as it is now, or a
"post it and we'll get it there if we have to teach carrier pigeons to
use a tarot deck and a vuvuzula, though it might take a while" method
(in other words, FidoNET-like).  The latter gets the job done but
whether or not people are willing to be patient in light of that kind
of latency is a different question entirely.
For what it's worth, Byzantium's working on a store-and-forward-like
architecture (mobile clients to sort-of stationary mesh nodes with
semi-persistent storage) for all of its apps (not just the microblog -
thanks again, Richo!).  As for the forward bit, we're working on a
sufficiently generic implementation of the latter technique (which
could use everything from amateur radio (as problematic as that might
be) to sneakernet) to eventually synchronize all reachable nodes' content.
Ways and means.

That reminds me of a question I've been meaning to ask lately...
Has anyone tried running Tor on top of OSv (
As I understand it, OSv is an ultra-small OS which is Linux
API-compatible and designed for running a single app only atop a
virtualization stack.  For example, it should, in theory, be possible
to run the Tor daemon within a copy of OSv, that would be the only
application running inside of that VM, and it should be running like
greased lightning because it would be the only process running in that VM.
Granted, it is fairly new so I do not believe anyone has done any
serious security analysis of OSv, but it seems like it would be an
ideal candidate for a very high performance Tor node.

Proof of concept was been proven in 2010.  Practical application is
probably being done by now.  Somebody is asleep behind the wheel if it
is not.
Hex-encoded blobs, if not binary blobs that show up under /lib/firmware.
Subverting hardware during design means getting lots of engineers in
the private sector to shut up.  That is not always easy.  Spending
time reversing the binaries they require (which few people do anyway)
and developing a version that is subverted requires keeping the lid on
fewer people, and can be done entirely in house (i.e. without telling
the manufacturer).
Did somebody mention looking for outbound UDP packets encrypted with
RC-6 or something?
That would work so long as the radio is not otherwise in use.  Radio
chipsets can be flipped around but it generates heat and uses up power
faster.  It should be more detectable than a subverted hardline.
Until somebody that works there blabs about it.  Is that a risk an
intel agency would accept?  Good question; my wild-assed guess is 'no,
not these days'.

MATLAB is additionally useful due to the fact that one of its toolkits
(PPT - Parallel Processing Toolkit) has two useful features.  First,
the PPT lets the user distribute computations making use of those
libraries across every machine registered with the licensing server
that also has a license for the PPT.  Second, the PPT lets the user
make use of CUDA-enabled graphics cards on each of those workstations
as well.
For crunching very large data sets in a more reasonable period of time

You do not.  keybase.io works just fine as a CLI app if you don't.
- From the frontpage:
"Keybase.io is also a Keybase client, however certain crypto actions
(signing and decrypting) are limited to users who store
client-encrypted copies of their private keys on the server, >>>an
optional feature we didn't mention above<<<."
keybase.io does an okay job of making some GPG commands easier to use
and remember.  At the very least it files a few of the rough edges off.
gpg -s -o something.gpg -r "bob at laundry.gov.uk" -e fooble.txt
keybase encrypt bob -o something.gpg -s -m fooble.txt
It's got some pretty nasty warts of its own, though.  For example, the
user cannot encrypt to multiple recipients at this time
(  It's a little
slow on startup.  The command to list your keybase.io keyring (which
is distinct from the contents of ~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg) is highly
unintuitive.  It abstracts away fewer of the common GPG command line
options than it seems.
After playing around with it for a few weeks, I think that apps like
gpg-crypter ( and GPG4win seem a
little more intuitive for new users.

They specifically talk about using some of the sub-$20us software
defined receivers (like the RTLSDR) to pick up the data to store
locally.  They have quite a few public repositories that might be
worth picking through, for that matter:
I don't have a whole lot of time to go hunting right now, but what
little I've done suggests that the source for odda (OuterNet Data
Delivery Agent, which takes the data stream from the sat downlink and
writes it as files appropriately) isn't available, or at least not
yet.  For setting up a data archive like that (which is an interest of
mine), I can't, in good conscience, trust a daemon the source of which
I can't examine.  Too much at risk for my use cases.
Doesn't look like it.

- From the official announcement:
"We decided to use SSL atop this service due in part to architectural
considerations - for example, we use the Tor daemon as a reverse proxy
into a load balancer and Facebook traffic requires the protection of
SSL over that link. As a result, we have provided an SSL certificate
which cites our onion address; this mechanism removes the Tor
Browser's ''SSL Certificate Warning'' for that onion address and
increases confidence that this service really is run by Facebook.
Issuing an SSL certificate for a Tor implementation is - in the Tor
world - a novel solution to attribute ownership of an onion address;
other solutions for attribution are ripe for consideration, but we
believe that this one provides an appropriate starting point for such
They definitely have the processing power to brute-force a vanity
.onion address - who-knows-how-many data centers around the world
worth of processing power.  We don't know how long they've been trying
to generate a memorable one, either.  It could have been weeks or months.
Reportedly, Runa Sandvik and Steven Murdoch advised them on this
project.  Maybe they can shed some light on this.

Whether we on the cypherpunks list like it or not, people organize
protests and direct action on Facebook.  That is one of the reasons
why FB gets filtered occasionally around the world.  While this does
not provide much in the way of anonymity, it does provide censorship

if I'm wrong) that one could dump an arbitrary FPGA's contents to do a
security audit on them.
Not to say that you're wrong, you make a good point, but it's taking
the discussion in a different direction.
We were talking about open CPU designs, so why keep them a secret?
Yeah.  It's pretty cool, isn't it?

That's been mentioned here serveral times.  Then someone else chimes
in with the injection of boobytrapped packages to ensure that designs
are automagickally tampered with or boobytrapped compilers (nevermind
that we have a workable way of detecting and mitigating the attack
(try it, it works!)).  Then someone else chimes in with "Well, we
can't even trust the FPGAs or the gate synthesis software for the same
reason."  This is yet another iteration of the same loop on this
mailing list.  It would be killfile-able if some of the basic terms
didn't change between iterations.
I suppose what I'm bitching about (and I've probably just faceplanted
by stepping into that particular pothole - it's my turn, I guess) is that
there seems to be no part of the threat model where risk is
acceptible.  I mean, going all the way back to hand-wired
electromechanical processors just to be able to bootstrap back to
silicon and losing 20-30 years of technical advancement?

I know a couple of folks who travel regularly who use this:
Their usage model is this: Unique Whirlenig disks are generated and
used for their passwords.  The passphrase used to generate the unique
Whirlenig disk is memorized.  They travel with a burner laptop with no
local password storage or sensitive information, just Git installed.
At the destination they check out the repo and re-generate their
Whirlenig disk, then print and assemble it locally.  The Whirlenig
assembly is securely destroyed (I presume by burning, I don't ask)
prior to departure.  I don't know what their on-storage cache
destruction protocols are like (my guess is RAMdisk, no swap on storage).

I did not say it was right.  I am genuinely curious about just how much the rough-and-tumble nature of this mailing list might or might not effect disclosures of this sort.  To put it another way, might someone have seen it nearly a year ago but kept quiet because they did not want to kick off a flamewar of this nature.
I do wonder if that might be the case.  There is no data to back it up one way or another, so that is all it can be, though.

Most of the projects out there are using OLSR (  A few are using the Babel protocol (
n.b., there is a difference between using a mesh networking protocol to distribute routes, and using IP forwarding to actually push the packets around.  The two together are required.
Most wireless mapping software out these doesn't see interfaces in ad-hoc mode, only infrastructure mode.  Thus, Wigle may not be the best way of mapping mesh networks in the greater context of wireless access points.
Wi-Fi direct is useful for short range comms.  We've had a lot of trouble making it work over longer ranges.  Wireless radios designed for use in infrastructure mode (including emitted power and duty cycle) are more reliable in the field.
Another standard.  Yay.  Time to find the docs and start reading...
There are other discovery models in use.  It'll be interesting to see how they compare.

It's an okay networking technology.  It's a few generations behind what we're actually fielding these days but they're using OLSR for maintaining the routing table, so that's something.  It's also hams only, so I'd advise caution if you don't have your ticket but want to experiment with it, new nodes that aren't recognized will draw a lot of attention.
One of the gotchas from their FAQ: "You can't use Wi-Fi to connect to a mesh node from your computer, netbook, smart phone or other wireless device."  Back to hardwiring.
Go Ubiquiti.  Linksys hardware is bobbins these days.

ad-hoc outlining and notetaking in my experience.  I got in the habit a while
ago and while it looks a little weird it's intuitive.  Plus, if you really
need to you can later render it into HTML, XML, or other document formats with
something lPandoc (
Tiddly does need JavaScript, but it's entirely self-contained (i.e., it's a
self-modifying HTML page; if you access one from a real web server you can't
edit it, you can only view it).  My threat model is such that JavaScript
kept in a file sitting on my desktop while airgapped is fine; yours is yours.

It was designed explicitly to be serverless.
I've never tried saving it to WebDAV; it'd be worth a couple of
experiements, I think. I know people who save theirs to Dropbox and then
share public read-only links to same and it seems to do what they want it to.
Twine applications, also.
As I understand Tahoe-LAFS, it's a filesystem, so you should be able to save
it and be done with it.
