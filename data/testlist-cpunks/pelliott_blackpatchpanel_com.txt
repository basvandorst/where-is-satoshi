@_subject: [liberationtech] Snowden masks for Holloween? 
Is it not funny, no one seems to be commercially oftering Snowden
masks for this Holloween.
I looked on Amazon and google and nothing on the first page of
a cursory search.
You would think it would be a top seller.
Is presure being applied?
Please tell me if you are aware of a source.
Thank You.
