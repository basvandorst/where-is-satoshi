Sounds like a good excuse to surveil, harass, and degrade the
productivity of dissident authors of fiction.

I agree.
Maybe read the book before you judge it?

A super majority of citizens are, by definition, insane. The purpose of
any decent anonymity system is to give the slender, sane minority a
fighting chance--and by extension, the human race.
Why on earth is willing public acquiescence a desirable quality
in an anonymity system? Fuck their recourse.

I wrote about the Dissent Project last year:
project home page:
Serious project, led by Bryan Ford at EPFL. Roger Dingledine said nice
things about it.
Project seems to lack momentum, but could offer cryptographically-
provable anonymity guarantees, as long as real-time comms is not the use case.

We are players in this drama, not observers.
If you think someone at Apple should leak sensitive documents in the
public interest, why don't you drive over to Cupertino and encourage
your contacts there to leak?
Evil men take power when good men do nothing.
Which are you?
