@_subject: CRYPTO - New US keyserver now fully operational - 
Sent from the cyberdeck of: pgpkeys at wasabi.io.com (PGP Slave Key Server)
The US-based keyserver  'pgp-public-keys at io.com' is now open to the public.
Come one, come all!
Here is the current file as returned by 'Subject: help'.
This site is a PGP key server SLAVE site.  It behaves
very similarly to the European PGP master sites, but there
are a few small differences which will be noted below.
The most noticable difference is that it answers your
requests immediately instead of waiting for a daily
batch job to run :-)
The particular installation at io.com does *not* log the details of
requests for keys, however the fact that you have sent mail to the
key server at all is logged in the daily sendmail logs.  These logs
will be erased automatically after one week.
PGP Public Keyservers
-------- -------------------------------------------------
ADD                    Your PGP public key (key to add is body of msg)
                       *** Note: your update is forwarded to a master
                           server and may take a few days to reappear
INDEX                  List all PGP keys the server knows about (-kv)
VERBOSE INDEX          List all PGP keys, verbose format (-kvv)
GET                    Get the whole public key ring
GET 0xA1B2C3           Get a single key by Key ID
                       *** Note: the master servers allow you to omit
                           the 0x in front of the Key ID.  The slave
                           servers do not.
GET userid             Get a single key by User ID
MGET substr            List all keys which match "substr"
                       *** Note: this is different from the master servers
                           which return the keys themselves, not just a
                           listing of their Key IDs.  Also the master
                           servers accept a wild-card expression; at
                           the moment we do not.
LAST days              Get the keys updated in the last `days' days
                       *** Note: not yet implemented
