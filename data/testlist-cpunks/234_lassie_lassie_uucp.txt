Originally To: Jim Nalbandian Is there some reason why you are bouncing your 'refused mail' back to the list?  If there is, I would, as would other, appreciate it if you could tell us.  If you don't have a reason, or are doing it simply to get attention, then STOP IT!

No free man shall ever be de-barred the use of arms. The strongest
reason for the people to retain  there right to keep and bear arms
is as a last  resort to  protect  themselves  against  tyranny  in
government. <-------- Thomas Jefferson                            --
