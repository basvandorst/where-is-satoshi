This kind of stuff really makes me wish Indigogo would allow donations
via Bitcoin as well as PayPal. Too many people have had trouble with
PayPal and they've done this kind of thing before. I, for one, am
encouraging anyone who wants to donate to do so via Bitcoin on the
MailPile site. Who the hell needs Paypal!

Oh I completely understand why they used Paypal. Like you said, not
enough people use Bitcoin to really make a successful go of a Bitcoin
based fundraising campaign. I'm just saying I'd like to see Indigogo
offer Bitcoin as an option. I'm sure a lot of people would use it and it
would also be a good way to get people interested in Bitcoin.

I believe we're headed back to the crypto wars of the 1990's. Except,
this time, the cypherpunks are going to have to battle both a technical
and a political adversary along with a fearful public who's easily
convinced of whatever the government wants them to believe.
Once end point security and end to end encryption get good enough to
keep them out, they'll start pushing for new laws requiring a backdoor.
The FBI tried this already only a few years ago.
Get ready for CryptoWars II. It's right around the corner.

This shouldn't really surprise anyone. Of course they'd at least give it
a try.

References: While he certainly could have been being humorous, I can't see why he
would have indicated 'yes' for any reason. I mean, he could have made a
funny comment or something sarcastic or any number of other responses.
The shaking his head yes while saying now would seem to indicate that
he's been told not to say that he's been asked.
It would seem logical that he would have been approached though. I mean,
they want total tech coverage. Why would Linux escape their attention?

@_subject: Snowden and Compilers 
References: Given that compilers are both a fairly easy to attack and amazingly
convenient target, it wouldn't surprise me if the NSA has subverted a
few specific compilers that are in common use. An attack of this nature
has been hypothised since the early to mid-1980's. They would have to be
amazingly dense not to have at least considered it.
On the flip side, the NSA likes to do things where it has the least
opportunity to be caught. Compiler subversion, while not "easy" to catch
by any means, might offer too big a risk of being caught for them to do
it. Being that they have a multitude of weirdly named programs
specifically set up to compromise software, the evidence would lean
towards they haven't done it but I'm sure it was, at the very least,
