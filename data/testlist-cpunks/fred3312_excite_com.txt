Hello,          I own a design firm with headquarters in NYC, I am writing this letter to inquire about any design work
you may have to outsource, Since my designers are students & recent grads, as well as  graphic artists from all over NYC, I can enter quotes at well below market rate: $30 per hour on HTML or JAVA and $30 to $50 per hour on Flash depending on the project. If we can  develop a relationship,  I can even beat these rates. for more info reply to this email with info in the subject field.
