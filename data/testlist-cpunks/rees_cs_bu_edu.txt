This is interesting.  Since most of the change-making machines in laundromats seem to use the side with the dead white guy, I wonder if it
would work to use this copy?

Hi.  Just picked this up from alt.dcom.telecom.  Doesn't it seem like
an illegal invasion of privacy to do something like this?  Or maybe
I just don't have the whole picture. Anyway, here it is:

@_subject: Roulette 
The Eudaemonic Pie by Thomas A. Bass (Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston,
1985), in chapter 6, discusses the various systems used in beating roulette.  It gives the names and dates of people who have beaten the
system through the use of martingales, biased wheels, and computers.  An
interesting book, highly recommended that you check it out.

@_subject: Money Laundering thru roulette 
In the book I mentioned earlier, "Th Eudamonic Pie", it mentions
a scheme by which a person can always break even while playing roulette.
Seems to me that this is exactly what is asked for.  If anyone wants it,
I'll type in the appropriate portion and send it to the list.

@_subject: Money Laundering thru Roulette 
As several people asked for the reference to the guy who
perfected a system for playing roulette in which one "neither wins or
loses", he was Marcel Duchamp and it happened in 1924.  This is on page 126  of the Eudaemonic Pie by Thomas Bass.
   Of course, as several people pointed out, there are a large number
of ways to break even in roulette.  So if you have bad money that
needs laundered, why not bet evenly on red and black each time.  Or even
easier, buy 10,000 dollars worth of chips and then cash them in immediately.
New and different money on demand.
   I get the impression though that I am missing something in the
discussion since no one has mentioned something like this and that merely
replacing the money isn't the objective here.
