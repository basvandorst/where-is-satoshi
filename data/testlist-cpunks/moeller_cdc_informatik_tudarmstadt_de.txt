Using an explicit state machine helps to get code suitable for
multiplexing within a single thread various connections using
non-blocking I/O.

I don't mind working with threads, but there's a lot of software out
there that uses single-threaded multiplexing, and adding SSL/TLS to
such software becomes much easier if the SSL/TLS library supports this
multiplexing paradigm.  (Not that it would be impossible otherwise --
another option, for Unix anway, is to fork off a processes that
handles a SSL/TLS connection and communicates with the main process
via a pipe.)
