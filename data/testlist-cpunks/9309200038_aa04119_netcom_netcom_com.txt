This reminds me of a science fiction story that I read once, published in
Analog: the smart-ass encrypted the solution of how to produce stable
antimatter, or cold fusion, or something similar, using Godel's Theorem.
The politicos back on Earth said that it would take them 200 years to
factor the N-size number that was sent back to Earth.  :)
Now, if I could just remember the name of the story and the issue...
