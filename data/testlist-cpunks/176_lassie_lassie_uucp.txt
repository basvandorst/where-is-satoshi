Oh you must be investing in the junk bond market. You know that
there is over $10,000,000,000 's in the US bond market. Oh, of
course you did. You are one of those Internet people that only
exists on the net. By the way what type of indicators could I use
on a global fund to maximize profit and reduce risk. You computer
hackers know everyting, do'nt you? Or do you just play with play
money?   :{)}

No free man shall ever be de-barred the use of arms. The strongest
reason for the people to retain  there right to keep and bear arms
is as a last  resort to  protect  themselves  against  tyranny  in
government. <-------- Thomas Jefferson                            --
