Branded Windows 95 PENTIUM Computer systems,  only  ï¿½195
You don't need an expensive new computer to type letters, look after household finances, enjoy the Internet,  keep a database or familiarise the family with computers.
We are disposing of  'second user' branded computers, which were once amongst the best you could buy. Now one can be yours for only ï¿½195 complete and there is no VAT to be added.
The Desktop computers have Windows 95 and Word Processing, Database, and Spreadsheet loaded and running. For a small extra you can 'Surf' the Internet or send E-mails. Why spend ï¿½1000 or more on the latest computer with tricky gizmos that you won't use and will require a "rocket scientist" to get going ?
