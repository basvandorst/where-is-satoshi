Does anyone have any opinions on the encrypting file
system (EFS) that is supposed to ship with NT 5.0?
The white paper on the MSDN web site says it uses
DESX (no explaination as to what the X is) and an
RSA public key algorithm to store the symmetric keys,
which are random for each file.
So what's DESX?
EFS appears to have the architecture to support
arbitrarily long keys although this has been crippled
in the NT5.0 release, presumably because of
export limitations.  It has the key recovery features
you would expect in a commercial product of the
type; they can be turned off administratively.
Is this a victory for wider use of encryption?

MSJ conflicts with the MS white paper in that, according to MS,you can
explicitly turn off key recovery at the domain level.  For
workstations not a part of a domain, key recovery can be turned
off at the local administrator level.
The domain setting overrides the local administrator setting
as long as the workstation is a member of a domain. So the
answer to your question, apparently, depends on the local
administrator's settings for the encryption policy.
Their summary is somewhat simplified.  The key managementhas several
alternatives with the usual tradeoffs between
security and convenience.  The private key for recovery can
be stored on a floppy, encrypted using a passphrase, or
for that matter can be destroyed.
Yes, if you are using self-signed certificates they are
generated randomly during each install.
