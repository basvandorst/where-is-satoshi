@_subject: customer tracking, et al... 
I don't know about the camera's/recognition in retail stores that were
mentioned, but at least here in NY, record stores are pushing something
called the I-Card.  The unit is a simple terminal in Tower Records(tho
I think they've dropped it now), some Sam Goody Records', J&R, etc.
When you 'apply' for a card, you fill out a customer survey, name/address/
etc.  They then take two copies of a bar code, and put one on the survey,
and one on a card they give you.  The terminal allows you to see music
and video previews and things of the sort, but to use it, you must slot
your bar code.  The result--a database somewhere with a profile on you
including all participating record stores you've been to , and what music
you've previewed.  Perhaps that should be the Eye-Card, eh?
