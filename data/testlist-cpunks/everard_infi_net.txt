In article <9512311818.AA16259 at all.net>, fc at all.net (Fred Cohen) says:
Anyone that has earned a PhD has EARNED the right to follow his/her name
with that distinction.  Power to him.  It's an accomplishment that we should
all strive for if we're so inclined.  Dr Cohen: I respect your degree and it
doesn't bother me one bit for you to  use the title that you deserve.
Let's consider the cretin that considers USC a "second rank school."
And what, may I ask, have YOU written?
I really don't understand this guys' hostility toward Dr Cohen.  But...
it just doesn't matter.  To hell with him.
