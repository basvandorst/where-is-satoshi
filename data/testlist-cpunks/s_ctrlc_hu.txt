sounds like my pbp: except with a 'c' and less features, from the readme:
v0.2 - experimental
PBP[0] is a simple python wrapper and a command line interface around
libsodium, to provide basic functionality resembling PGP. It uses
scrypt for a KDF and a much simpler packet format, which should be
much harder to fingerprint, pbp also provides an experimental forward
secrecy mode and a multi-party DH mode.
pip install pbp
you possibly need to run (or an equivalent command) sudo apt-get install git
python-virtualenv gcc python-dev libffi-dev to satisfy all basic dependencies.
Design goals:
 1. use modern crypto
 2. provide similar functionality to PGP
 3. be extensible
 4. difficult to identify based on fingerprinting
 5. provide extensive testing
 6. strive for security
Cryptographic primitives are based on the NaCl library from
 The KDF used is scrypt.
Provides basic public key encrypt/decrypt, sign/verify and secret key
encrypt/decrypt modes, as well as the ability to sign, verify, list,
generate, export and import keys.
using pbp and the underlying pysodium[1] library it's easy to extend
pbp.  Some examples are the experimental forward secrecy mode (see
description in docs/chaining-dh.txt), the support for ECDH key
exchanges from the command-line and generation of arbitrarily large
random byte streams.
[1]  also available on
    pbp tries to avoid to store any sensitive plaintext info, the
encrypted files all should look like random noise. for a description
of the packet formats see docs/fileformats.txt.
All py files come with their internal tests, unit tests are in
tests.py, and commandline functionality is tested in test.sh.
pbp locks the process memory, so it cannot be swapped to disk. Also
pbp uses SecureString[2] to overwrite sensitive key material after
usage in memory, so keys have a short window of opportunity to leak.
[2] Generate a key
   pbp -g -n alice
sending howdy.txt using public key encryption from alice to bob
   pbp -c -S alice -r bob -i howdy.txt
decrypt an encrypted file using public key crypto
   pbp -d -S bob -i howdy.txt.pbp
sending howdy.txt using secret key encryption
   pbp -c -i howdy.txt

   pbp -e -S alice -r bob -i howdy.txt -o ./secret-message
bob decrypts howdy.txt from alice using experimental forward secret mode
   pbp -E -S bob -r alice -i ./secret-message
initiate ECDH key exchange
   pbp -D1

   pbp -D2 -Dp 'public component from D1'

participate in a 4-way DH exchange, 2nd message
  pbp -De -S alice -n 'friends001' -i oldkeychain -o newkeychain
this is one big pipe that creates a 3-way ECDH secret between alice, bob and carol:
  pbp -Ds -S alice -Dp 3 -n 'test-dh' -i /dev/null |
   pbp -Ds -S bob -Dp 3 -n 'test-dh' |
   pbp -Ds -S carol -Dp 3 -n 'test-dh' |
   pbp -De -S alice -Dp 3 -n 'test-dh' |
   pbp -De -S bob -Dp 3 -n 'test-dh'
of course instead of a pipe you could use any kind of transport mechanism

i believe this is not really necessary for this type of curve. especially if
we manage to switch to elligator curves soonish.
unfortunately pbp has such a distinguisher, it decides between asym/sym
encryption. i should somehow get rid of that.
absolutely. i like small keys, that's why we do ecc, not RSA. as it allows to
use crypto e.g. also in tweets, signed tweets leave you with  ~55 chars for
messages, or as we recently found out also in the comment field of bank
wiretransfers. i wasn't really joking doing a numberstation style output
format. the  might be quite good
for easy human voice transmission, like in key parties. takes a bit of time
reciting 32 words, but might be easier than reciting a pgp keyid.
pbp uses separate and unrelated keys for confidentiality and others for signing.
seems like a good start for reusing code.

recipients encryption public key. btw, pbp creates 3 keys for each id, one
long-term master for key-signing only, and two sub-keys one for encryption and
one for generic signing. the encryption subkey is only used for the encryption
of the message key. is that a problem? isn't that how pgp does it?
this is mostly a problem only for verifying signatures, in a keyring with lots
of public keys. but the operation is only on the hash of the message. for
encryption this is neither so much a problem as traditionally the number of
private keys one person holds is manageable. however even in these cases the
wrong key is detected after decoding the message key, which again is a 32 byte
ciphertext. so i don't expect this to be very slow. if this really becomes a
problem you can start pbp with different home directories using the --basedir
indeed. but that was one of the design goals, to fix the problem openpgp being
a strong selector and low hanging fruit in all forensic tools. i'm very happy
to spend some cpu cycles on locating the right key if it means the adversary
has a higher computational effort than me.
indeed, this need has not been addressed yet.
i would be delighted to hear your commentary on
in the nacl implementation i believe something like this happens: P_a and S_b,
as well as on the other side S_a and P_b are used in a ECDH secret derivation,
which then is passed through hsalsa20 to derive the key, then this shared
secret is used as a key for a salsa20xpoly1305 authenticating stream algo,
that also needs a 32 byte nonce for encryption. so indeed both sides can
decrypt the message encrypted to the other in this scheme. all this of course
is overly simplified you can find the details on pp15

these papers? it strengthens my opinion that w3 does not seem like a competent
place for handling this kind of stuff. some good intentions sprinkled with
lots of "libtech plausible deniable Naïveté" and some rare gems hidden in
between. source: i started to comment on some of the topics, would be interested in more
insights into the others.
yaatse (yet another attempt to save email)? this should've been the last
paper, if the goal of the conf was to seem competent in this topic...
hmmm, mpls is a very simple thing. and totally irrelevant if people deploy
already end-to-end crypto. what is this good for? tagging anonymous streams? i
guess i have to read the paper...
i believe they are trying to sell us MITM as something that is also done by
the "good guys"? wtf?

this sounds interesting, there was open-calais so far from reuters which did
this, but only as a centralized service, if gratis, or you could build your
own corpuses if your domain is not covered by the widely available ones.
however there is lot's of problems with non-english names, for evaluation of
such entity-extractors i recommend to test them with some data set containing
eu public officials, with names in greek, bulgarian and some latin-speaking
country and some slavic speaking one and you have something that can confuse
such entity extraction quite sufficiently. i guess i'm gonna give this a test,
maybe it's better. but i guess this again also mostly depends on the corpus.

i can: pond stores the key material in tpm, whether to trust tpm or not is
open for debate. gpg is able to work with smartcards, and qubes has this
split-pgp mode. these are all quite cool approaches to the host security

 <54D17872.4090401 lets not forget the local active adversaries. finfisher sells to a lot of
customers, not only the nsa has such capabilities - assuming you allude to the
(5|9|many)eyes alliance with he GPA, or do you mean cloudflare?
hackingteam has that market covered i guess.
indeed. however they also endanger their support networks and if the brave
sacrifice themselves for some community which is compromised in the mean time
because of the 'immma compromised already' attitude does not advance their
cause very much if there's no one left to die for.
furthermore cryptographically secure is as the 7 rules show only one aspect,
as long as people can be tricked with spear-phishing emails or fancy linkedin
pages to install malware. crypto means only one thing, increasing the
likelihood of malware instead of in-transit interception of plaintext
communication. which brings us directly to host security and its dismal state.
how many of these brave souls have updated their gear lately? how much malware
is running on those hosts? how many believe that antivirus is something
positive and not a system level backdoor?
so by definition not having control over a device means the device can do
whatever it wants within the limits of its capabilities. so this means you
cannot ensure confidentiality, authenticity, anonymity, etc. the probability
of a device acting against the will/interest of its user is pretty high
already considering only commercial adversaries. however if the person is one
of special interest because of 1/ the person itself is interesting or 2/ the
person is one with weak security standards and in close proximity to persons
of interest, in this case the probability of the device acting against the
interest of the user is quite higher. so of course if your threat model is
currently the littlesis one, then rot13 does protect you against 90% of
adversaries. however disregarding more advanced adversaries can reduce your
future agency against them enormously. like john travolta by the time
scientology became an adversary for him, they had all the compromise to bind
the other point that is ignored, is the asymmetry in the capabilities and
modus operandi of the opposing adversaries. if we are considering the model of
the arabian spring where you have people against some regime. the government
has the monopoly of violence, and other stuff, that makes them able to work
extralegally, also there's experience for many years in suppression of mass
movements (look at cointelpro, or how the occupy movement got nowhere). on the
other side, for citizens one of the expensive tools there exists in such an
asymmetric setting is the sacrifice, like the soviets in the 2nd world war
everyone gets ammunition but only 1 out of 5 soldiers a gun. the others get an
order of inheritance of the gun. worked quite well, however it was very
wasteful and tragic. of course losses can be cut, but they require efforts and
resources that like the soviets, avg people hypnotized by us propaganda lack.
i did a bit of that consideration i hope. let me ask you what scenarios can
you envision where there is no control of devices and thus no authenticity,
confidentiality, etc? and yet useful for people above the littlesis adversary
model? i think the context of the littlesis model is of little interest in
this community though.
can you be a bit more specific what you mean, and why you think that it would
be efficient? what are your metrics for "success" or "efficiency"?
let me try too: there's a few things that can be done, 1/ eliminate all
snakeoil 2/ educate the few people that are actually doing things 3/ most
importantly go harass the vendors that profit from the sabotaged
infrastructure that these brave souls trust blindly. i'm sorry, the fact that
we have not much to protect ourselves with is mostly due to the profit silicon
valley, they wanted as fast as much users as possible, sacrificing everything
for their quarterly profits, the externalities of this as it can be euphemised
are on the victims. to do real stuff, the opsec is very hard and will be
limited to only a few, and even most of them will fall, so everyone should
expect to be owned and the wider consequences of that. although i think it's a great idea to raise the general costs for adversaries,
i think this is much more expensive than you think. as an attacker i'll attack
the cheapest way possible to maximise my results, surely. so when you start
raising the cost of the cheapest way, i do not care about this until the cost
is higher than the second cheapest attack. in which case it becomes the
cheapest, and i use that. if i do my job well, i will continue a bit the old
attack, so i force you to overspend on that defense, and make my life easier
for some more time.
i don't know where this comes from, but this is indeed wrong if anyone ever
implied that, and it's not only a journalistic tool.
lastly - allow me to naively exaggerate a bit - i think such regular "why
can't you save us all" is very distracting in a community that is allegedly
about writing code, not mails. our resources are limited and we are already
motivated to work on this stuff. having to explain things over and over again
should be handled by the people enjoying publicity and attention, not those
enjoying good math, code and obscurity.

 python
# implements simple one-way encryption pipe using rsa and keccak-based
# spongewrap
# useful at least in the following use-case: you have an untrusted
# host on which plaintext data arrives, which you want to encrypt
# before it is forwarded in a hostile environment to the final
# recipient holding a private key in a safe location. In this one-way
# setting the recipient is never talking to the host doing the
# encryption.
# Example: take photos in a hostile situation, encrypt the the photos
# and being unable to recover them until arrival in the save location
# with the the private key. (note, this does not protect against
# forensics!)
# crypto: a random 32 byte message key is encrypted with the public
# key of the recipient in oaep padded RSA, then this message key is
# fed into SpongeWrap, which is then used to authenticated encrypt the
# message.
# output format:
#    2  bytes - the length of the RSA encrypted message key
#    n  bytes - the RSA encrypted message key
#    m  bytes - the encrypted message
#    16 bytes - the "MAC"
# depends: `pip install m2crypto spongeshaker SecureString`
# create keys using openssl:
# `openssl genrsa -out my.key 4096`
# `openssl rsa -in my.key -pubout >> my.pub`
# `cat my.key my.pub >>my.pem`
# `srm -fll my.key`
# deploy my.pub on the encrypting host, secure my.pem in a safe
# location for decryption.

two things:
1/ stop beating the dead horse (email)
2/ there is (or at least should be) a huge difference for cryptograms
encrypted in transit between peers, and data resting and being queried by
only one person.
3/ protocols like pond which address adversarial progress over the years
should be preferred over outdated and broken protocols. but i guess i'm
repeating 1/ already.

depends what the intended goal of said software is:
1/ winning a battle in the 1st cryptowars to make crypto exportable? i think
it brilliantly succeeded at this design goal.
2/ making cryptograms stand out as strong selectors thanks to all this juicy
plaintext metadata in the openpgp packet as defined per rfc4880. again, a
smashing success.
maybe if your usecase is not covered by the above two, maybe you should be

this device - if unmodified - has severe limitations regarding inputs. e.g. if
the armory contains some key material, it's hard to have it stored in there in
a ciphertext, the only way to unlock (provide a decryption key for the
ciphertext inside) it currently is from the device you compartmentalize your
keys from, the host. there's a thing that is however extremely cool in this
device, the arm trustzone (cue the sad violinist while the TCM jamboree slides
are shown). pity that this gets so far ignored.
it's a neat but quite misunderstood device i think.

References: <20150515115457.GX7148
webapplications are simple development cost externalisations by the VC
vultures and their startup slaves and js are a perfect tool in gathering more
private information to sell that.
webapplications shouldn't exist in the first place, there's OS level binaries
that should be used instead. but i totally understand that the time-to-market
and the RoI of hiring a bunch of dumb jsdevs is greatly more profitable than
doing it right. the incentives of the system subvert and cannibalize the
system itself. omnomnom.
since you addressed sandboxing, i'm much more of a fan of reducing the attack
surface than sandboxing. sandboxing should be only used in a defense-in-depth
setup, with other factors being more important, like reducing all the layers
of cruft underneath.
also lets not forget that the security in browsers is like the security
offered by tls, it's mostly in the interest of the industries, not the users
sitting behind the browsers. sandboxing in chrome for example is good enough
for the startups to not leech the data in other tabs, but looking at the
results of various exploit compos confirms that the more resourceful
attackers are not much deterred by the sandboxing. whereas noscript is indeed
in the interest of the user, not the industries.

also you should look into random-agent-spoofer it does disable a lot of the
mozilla sabotage crap.

it doesn't even look cool, it just shows how much you don't understand

ok, i see you understand the primary goal of pgp signatures. i also see, that
usually you don't sign here your messages, both of this i approve of.

nope: it's a CACert and it uses sha1 for the signature hash algo, call it
sentimentality, but it takes some time for me to part with this beautiful
idea, that sadly died. i guess i'll have to jump on the next SOP (letsencrypt),
which by it's success became a much juicier target than CACert ever was.
there'll be an update soon for this cert.

most of this is pre-snowden stuff, there has been little updates in the last
few years. it's quite a bit of work not only to maintain this (new screenshots
for changing UIs over the years) and then also translating all this in all the
languages in which it is available. dunno if ttc had attracted more funding to
update siab lately.
i contributed to siab but i stopped recommending it 1-2 years ago, as i have
similar concerns as you regarding the material.
the clients of the above linked material are usually (sadly) aligned with the
interests of US foreign policy. and just like with tor (also the basis for
whonix as you surely know) i'm not surprised the US is sponsoring something
they can break, but provides some cover for the pawns in their geopolitical

this was not my interpretation of "alternatives to tor", and surely some come
with much reduced functionality, percy++ just being a library. there's much
more use-cases than using a browser anonymously, in some of these use-cases
tor can indeed be replaced by these technologies. also i still consider that
some people on this list are actually building stuff, instead of being overly
verbose, and for those, at least pynchon gate and percy++ should be
interesting building blocks.
a real alternative to tor would tackle the GPA issue, for that i think the
only solution is high-latency, that means also that browsing the web will be
quite a different experience with such.
btw david chaums cmix is also an interesting inspiration for a replacement in
certain use-cases, but surely not in general either. and not for dissidents in
tanzania now (which was no explicit requirement anyways). but then those
dissidents probably have also problems with computers in general including
we agree on this one. however this was not the point of the question i
believe, and as such fits as an answer.

you are in the circle polluting this list. yes.
this is the cypherpunks mailinglist (or at least it was) and cypherpunks write
code, not stupid insults like this. you are sabotaging all the good work that
could be done here, and when someone posts something code related, you either
say "this is not for the average ignorant tanzanian activits" or you
immediately feel buthurt. so if someone, you should fuck off.
