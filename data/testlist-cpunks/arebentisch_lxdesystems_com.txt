To quote from the text:
"In 2008, Swedenbs parliament narrowly passed a law that lets its
signals intelligence agency (FRA) monitor the content of all
cross-border cable-based internet traffic to combat bexternal threatsb
such as terrorism and organized crime b but only after obtaining court
permission, and upon the explicit request of government or defense
In other words, Sweden does monitor all traffic.

Indeed, though "capabilities" would not imply they actually do.
I am sorry for my choice of words bc it is also difficult to determine
what "monitoring" means to an institution, e.g. "printing emails
forwarded to them".
The main advantage of a court order is that we get a formal (classified)
track record of the actual cases and statistics. Parliament scrutiny is
a useful device. It is helpful to assess intelligence performance, and
make services more efficient. You need external checks and balances,
otherwise technocratic bodies get lazy and useless.
Prior Court Order: Throughout Europe the EU Telecoms Package rules
should apply. In the reform process some insisted on the prior court
order principle. The objective and motivation from my colleagues (who
wrote the related amendment) was to prevent automated net filtering (as
demanded by the content industries and AT&T).
The driving force for traffic monitoring is not the Levithan in Europe,
but content interests. Italy is very advanced in media industry driven
ISP filtering. They tried it earlier than the other member states via
voluntary agreements.

Technically ACTA could enter into force outside the EU when ratified by
its non-EU members. Politically it is cratered.
Commissioner Karel de Gucht argued the Commission would seek approval
("consent") again after an opinion of the European Court of Justice.
That won't happen, simply because the ECJ would probably dismiss the
case as the process is terminated, and even if they ruled it legal the
Commission couldn't reconsult.
That is the main step on the learning curve of successful Europarl
battles, a positive attitude towards representative democracy, escaping
defaitism. But we don't need insane campaigns for the impossible. In
early stages it takes very few persons and small resources. Four years
ago it was possible to put it asleep with approx. 10k and a bit
complicated technical voodoo.
What's hardly known is that this week, yesterday, the EU Parliament
strengthened the EU customs enforcement framework, the corresponding
element of the ACTA package in the acquis communautaire:
I sincerely hope people would not waste their capacity upon the INDECT
honeypot now.

I do share the general scepticism against government regulators. It makes a difference if you argue markets are contestable by virtue
(which is true to a certain degree) to prevent regulation or enact policies so that markets ought to become contestable.
In the 1990ths cyberlibertarianism was widespread, as we had to struggle  with the old state telecom monopolies, analog governments and crypto  export regulations or even the remains of central planning. After 911 the state security paradigm set the agenda where civil society took the  pro-freedom narrative. In the past five years old postponed debates  reemerged that found new commercial allies (blocking, child porn,  filtering, trade funnel). The surveillance and privacy debate of the  1980ths onwards was mostly focussed on state interest in our individual  data, today companies harvest data (made available to the state). In the  Arab spring the targets are geriatric regimes and a rebellious youth.
The main question for me is how to get "good governance" in a field  characterized by Schumpeterian competition.
How to make governance side with the challengers, not the old bulls. For  instance 10 years ago Google was still  weak in lobbying. How do we avoid that regulators shoot in the cradle of emerging technology firms, add risks and strangulate emerging models? The toolset of open market policies (pro-competition, pro-openstandards, pro unlicensed spectrum, pro-open internet..) has insufficient support in multistakeholder fora. Patent regimes slow down the transition because challengers do not have large I originate from a city that was mostly dependend on the typewriter  industry. All the companies a domestic legislator would have consulted  back then about the future of word processing are now gone. When  governments do not know what the dominant players of tomorrow would be it still makes sense to be first. Being first implies that you naturally  would regulate against the current dominant business players to path the  way for the challengers.
