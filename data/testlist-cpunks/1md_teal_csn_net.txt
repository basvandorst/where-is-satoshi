@_subject: anyone know what this "top secret" code does?Re: anyone know what this "top secret" code does? 
Does anyone remember the scenario someone suggested awhile back that
hypothesized a scheme by the NSA or other TLAs to encourage the use
of WEAK crypto?  It involved spreading a lot of F.U.D. about PGP and
other strong crypto methods, followed by the discovery/leak of a
supposedly "strong" crypto algorithm to replace it.
This may not be it.  It may just be a trial balloon to gauge the
reaction of the crypto community to an anonymous, "gift from heaven"
crypto algorithm.  But at least be aware of what COULD happen.
One tactic that might be tried is an intentional "leak", followed by
a flurry of legal actions designed to make it look like the "leak"
was going to cause some real damage to their cryptanalysis efforts,
due to it being "unbreakable", or whatever.  Of course, anything
"leaked" would be crippled in some undetectable manner so as to
provide a back door...
