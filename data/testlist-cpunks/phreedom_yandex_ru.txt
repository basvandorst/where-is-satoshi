NixOS distro[1] takes build reproducibility seriously and build determinism is being worked on.
I have patched the most important toolchains to not systematically introduce non-determinism[2]. Some of the patches are in the master branch already, some are in the staging branch and will be merged in a month or two. These patches are sufficient to make a large subset of package builds deterministic.
After the merge, I'll do another round this time fixing non-determinism due to quirks of build systems of specific packages. Luckily, there aren't that many packages like Firefox and luckily Firefox has been already tackled by someone else :)
I'm committed to making at least installation media, typical desktop and server installs fully deterministic.

This is what we need everyone to adopt. Your ID = your public key hash and not an account on some server you don't control. Glad to see more people adopt this idea. Any chance of interoperability with other projects with similar aims and ideas like Cables? [1]
