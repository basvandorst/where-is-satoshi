So what?
I can gaurentee that I will never see any "entitlement" (not that I believe that there is any entitlements in life other than death & taxes) in return for the taxes I pay (at 50% income no less). IMHO no non-US citizen has a right to one thin dime of my tax dollars. Period no exceptions. Don't like it PISS OFF and go back to whatever stink hole you came from. I for one am sick and tired of politions cow-towing to a bunch of special intrest groups who don't even represent US citizens. If they can't support themself when they come to this country then they need to stay where they are. We have plenty of home grown dead beats sucking off the government tit without shipping them in.
Now on the driver licenses. Every state requires some type of ID to get one (ie birth certificate, ss prof of resedency, ..ect). Should you have to be a citizen to get one? No, with the exception of those living inside a large metropoliten area (Chicago,NewYork,L.A.) a car is a requirment. Trust me I've lost my license and you would not beleive what a hassel it is just to get back and forth to work or the store without one. IMHO unless you are out killing people with your car the state should
not be allowed to take away your driver license. Especialy for such trivial matters as too many speeding tickets, not to mention all the non-driving related reasons the state can suspend your license for (in Florida non payment of child support is good enough reason).
P.S.: We did kill off all the natives and it IS our country. This county was founded to get away from all the European crap and I see no reason 200 years later we should be working to make this country as F@ up as they are.
Well that's my $0.02 worth. :)

This clause has been one of the "weak links" of the Constitution used by our government to regulate business in the 20th century. Rosevelt used it as justification for many of his unconstitutional projects in the 30's. Nixion used it for his "price freezes" in the 70's.
This clause had good purposes when it was put into the Constitution. What it was for was the following:
    -Give the government the power to establish tariffs & regulate trade with foriegn governmnets.(this had previously been handled by the individual states)
    -Prevent the states from imposing tariffs on products coming into or leaving their state or otherwise hamper commerice between the states.
This clause was never intended to give the federal government unlimited power to "regulate commerce" inside of the country.
Remember that our founding fathers were fearfull of a powerfull centralized govewrnment. They established checks and balances, and only gave the federal goverment the minimum amount of power needed to keep the country together. All other powers were to be regulated to the states and the people.
We have no-one to blame but ourselfs. Our founding fathers new that we needed an inteligent, well informed, population for a democracy to survive. Unfortunatly we have truned into a country of sheep who beleive everything the "boob tube" tells them. At the drop of a hat they are willing to give up hard earned fredoms paid for with the blood of our ancestors for small promises of security.

Well folks,
I am not in the habit of jumping into flame wars, but......
I beleive the concern of Mr. Smith and my others concerning myself is that the methods used to "protect" us from such events are more harmfull than the initial threat.
It is all too often that a minor threat receives massive publicity in the press. Then politions jump in with knee-jerk reactions to add "new and improved" restrictions to ones liberties & give law-enforcement sweeping new powers, Consitution be damed. If you paied any attention to the Senate hearing after Oklahoma and TWA 800 you could such behaviour of our polititions even though such laws will not help 1% to prevent such acts in the future.
I think what we have here is the all to common practice of grouping all criminal activities under the heading of "terrorism".While this may be advantagious for the Federal Government to do so placing what was once the juristiction of the States into the hand of the Feds. It does make nice splashy headlines for the newsmedia so they can sell more newspapers. It has no place in a rational disscusion of the security issues of Computers, Networks, and the Internet.
If someone aquires personal information about myself and at worst steels all the money out of my bank account. That is a crime, it is theft, and their are plenty of laws on the books to handle such a crime. It is NOT terrorism. While I agree that there is potential for harm being caused by a sofisticated, well orginised, state sponcered terrorist orginization, I for one am not going to lose any sleep over it. Yes there is a "threat" but No the sky is not falling.
 Pulling at ones hartstrings in such a debate only shows the wekness and emptyness of your argument. I am unaware of you location but between growing up in the MiddleEast & my service in the military I have seen my fair share of the "better" side of Man. You by no means have a monopoly on this.
Mr. Smith bring up a vailid point. It is one of perspective. Who you consider terrorist and who you consider heros depends on what side of an issue you stand. The American saw no problem with the 10's of thousands who died in the fire bombing of Dresdin or the Atomic Blasts over Japan. The populations Germany & Japan were supportive of their leadership in the murder of millions durring their campaines of expantion. Look at Ireland; if you are Prodistant or British the IRA are the terrorist while
if you are Catholic then it is the British & Prodistant that are the "terrorist". The Jews in Israel had no problem with blowing up the British but don't like it too much now that the Palisinians are doing the same thing to them.
The whole issue of "Terrorist" vs. "Freedom-Fighter" is one of perspective.
 More unwarrented use of "acts of terror" and "terrorism". Unauthorised access to information is not an act of terror. PEROID. Someone looked at somthing they shouldn't have. that's it. Put that at the criminal level of a mistamener . Could someone use that information for a more serious criminal act at some later point in time. Yes. Is this likely, eh mabye, mabye not. If it is illegal for me to carry a knife then I am only guilty of carring a knife I am not guilty of commiting
murder even though it is possiable for me to commit murder with a knife.
We all live in a "violent" world. Alway have and alway will. Just the nature of the beast.
And what did you do after speaking the these "students"? As a concerned citizen did you bother to report this information to the State Department, FBI, Immigration? Or did you just walk away with all kinds of warm fuzzies because you got dirty talking to potential "terrorist".
[more bloated rehash of media-catch phrases]  Well you have artfully side-steped the issue with a rather self-indulgend tear jerker. The issue presented was that security by obsecurity DOES NOT WORK! If you are that conserned about stoping the dreaded "Cyberterrorest" then you should present your solutions in a open forum for peer review. Ofcource sense we are not part of your elite "counter-cyberterrorest" force I imagine that you do not consider anyone else your peer. Or could it be you inability to debate and defend your ideas in a
public forum with those who have more experiance and better comprehention of the security issues we face at the dawn of the 21st century.
Hiding away is closed groups disscussing solutions to "THE THREAT" where you are the only voice on security may be a big bost to your ego but does little to improve security on a significant scale.

My opinions on the topic of CyberTerrorism:
The issue of cyberterrorism can be divided into 3 main parts:
-What is the threat.
-Who is the threat.
-How to respond to the threat.
What is the threat?
This can be subdivided into 3 classifications:
Catastrophic Terrorist Attack
This type of attack results in a financial loss or civil liberty infringement but is not of the scale of a Catastrophic Attack.
    - A criminal infiltrates a bank computer and illegally transfers funds.
    - A criminal obtains credit card information and uses fraudulently.
    - A criminal obtains personal information and uses illegally.
         - Blackmail
         - Job discrimination
         - credit denials
         - insurance denials
Minor Hacker Attacks
This is a sophisticated, well organized, State sponsored Terrorist.
His goals are the same as any other terrorist. He wishes to reak havok on society to further his political agenda.
The CyberTerrorist/Mad Scientist
These will come in varying levels of sophistication and ability. They will range from the petty thief to the super-hacker that can hack banking systems.
The Hacker
Average age: 15-25 Above average intellegence.
Basically he is in it for the challenge. To brake in a system no one else has broke into. For the most part harmless.
How to Respond to the Threat?
This all depends on which threat you are responding to.
The best way to defend against the computer criminal is information & training.
System administrators must be aware of potential security risks to their systems.
Software vendors should be open and forthcoming about security holes when they are found.
End users should be familiar with what types of risks are involved when "on-line".
      - what type of information is covertly being gathered about them. {Thank-You NetScape}
      - what type of information should and should not be transmitted in the "open"
      - what is PGP, how to use it, when to use it. Every user should have a copy.
The Hacker
The same as above. If sys-admins are sloppy about security they have much more to worry about than some school kids pranks. Most of the Hackers activities are harmless and can be a mixed blessing in disguise to a sys-admin. A Hackers prank may awaken him to the sad shape of his security and move him to make changes before he gets hit by the Computer Criminal or Cyber Terrorist.
Well that's my basic thoughts on the matter. I restrained from going too indepth as I did want to keep this under 1000 lines (bad spelling and all). :)
I am willing to discuss this more indepth on a point by point basis.

But who's standard?
I constantly here cries for standardization from those in the computer industry. I for one am against it. I like having choices, choices that are taken away by standardization.
In the area of crypto telephones I am definitely against standardization. If I wish to have an encrypted telephone connection my primary concern is that it is secure not whether or not I can communicate to every other phone out there.
I fear that an organized attempt to standardize will only bring about a 'weak' protocol for encrypted communications. One only has to look at what other standardization atemps have produced. Look at the works of IBM, Lotus, Microsoft, Netscape, all who have a vested interest in international sales. They have all to often tried to pawn off weak security in favor of the $$ from international sales.
A tower-of-babel is exactly what we need. The free market at its finest. The lemmings and the ignorant will use products from the "major" manufactures falsely believeing that they are secure. Those of us truly concerned with our security will have other choices to make.

It really is irrelavent weather the reduction in freedoms is cause by "evil conspiritors"
or "well intentioned patriots". The end result is the same. When you wake-up one day and
find that every thing you say & everything you do falls under the watchfull eye of "Big
Brother" will you really care how things got that way?
I'v worked with them I KNOW they are. :)
See this is where you & I part ways. It is a Presidents responciblity as it is the
responcibility of all civil servants wether elected or appointed or hired. They all take
an oath of office To protect & defend the Constitution against all enemies foriegn &
domestic ... Not the country, not the "big picture", not the current establishment but the
Constitution. The cornerstone that the Constitution is built on is that the People are in
charge. Not the FBI, not the NSA, not the CIA, not the Joint Cheifs but the People. It
also says that the power of the governmnet is limited, they can only do so much and no
more. All rights & powers not explicitly given to the goverment belong to the People. This
doesn't mean that well if we have a really good reason or if we lie real good about it we
can over step out authority. NO it means what it says only this and no more!! Big Picture
be damed!! I doubt that the People would take much comfort know that they had all been
sold into slavery but it was necisary for the Big Picture.
I never claimed infinite rights I claimed inalienable rights there is a difference.
Infinite rights implies rights without ends. Inalienable rights implies rights that can
not be taken away. They are my rights reguardless of the efforts of petty would be
dictators or government bureaucrats. They may conduct them selfs in a manor that violate
my rights but that does not mean that I no longer have those rights. I never claimed any "conspiracy". No mention of the Tri-Lateral Commision or New World
Order. :)
I am just pointing out what is happening here and now. Our elected officals, appointed
officers, and government employes are disregarding the Constitution and violating out
rights. I could care less why. I want it stoped and stoped now. I will do what ever is
nessicary to inform others that this is happening and hopefully convince them that this
should stop. If some one steals your car do you really car if it was a lone "crack head"
that did it or an orginized criminal cospiracy (MOB) that did it? It is wrong, it is
illegal, and it must stop.

This is the same everywhere. If these were programs that the majority were

You pop down to the local bank here's $500 cash, they give you your card, when you have used up your $500 you throw it away. Of cource the issuer of the card would charge some fee for the service, say $1 on every $100, maybe more maybe less the market will decide that. :)  No one need know who I am or what I am purchasing.

We could create a network of anonymous remailers with mailboxes. All messages in the mailboxes are stored encrypted. No information about the users are keep. Users would be be given x K of mailbox space.
We could use PGP keys for encrypting the messages. Each user would have his own key pair for his anonymous mailbox. Any plain text messages received to the server would be encrypted on recept.

This was not a 'personal' interview. The paper was not interested in Ms. Dyson's views on anonymity on the internet because she seemed like a nice person. The only reason she was interviewed is because of her position with the EFF as chairwoman.
Ms. Dyson knows this, the reporter knows this, the paper knows this, and so should everyone else.
Under such circumstances this interview should be seen as an 'official' statement from the chairwoman of the EFF. Trying to call this a 'personal' interview and not reflecting 'official' EFF policy is just plain old spin-doctoring. Ms. Dyson should have had more common sense than this.
These statements made by her are akin to the chairman of Philip Morris saying that he believe that cigarette smoke cause cancer but that's just his opinion and not the 'official' company position on it. Who would believe it? How long would he still have his job after making such a statement?
The EFF should make an official statement of their position on this issue and if it is not the same as Ms. Dyson's she should be removed from the board. IMHO this is to important of an issue for the EFF to try to ignore.

There are already checks and balances in dealing with defamation. Take the following example:
I post a message stating that Phil Zimmerman is a @ and that PGP is full of holes.
The immediate responce I would receive from the group would be some rather nasty flames, a couple of questions, most would ignore. Because Phil has a much greater reputation than I do such a blatant defamation would do my reputation much harm while doing his little or no harm. It may actually improve his reputation by the many follow up posting re-affirming his good reputation and his quality product. The only way I could get away with such a message would be to back it up with some strong proof
and the support of others with equal or greater reputation as Phil.
Now if I anonymously post the same message.
The results would be the same as above only no one but the truly "net clueless" would pay any attention to the message. It would be seen as a "troll" and be dealt with accordingly. Once again no damage has been done to Phil's reputation.
Now where things get intrusting is when the rolls are reversed.
Say Phil posts a message that I am a @ and my product is full of holes and that I am realy a NSA stooge.
Many at first would take Phil's word at face value because his reputation is much better than mine. It is only my fault that my reputation is not equal or greater than his. Because of this I now have two choices, I can stay and fight for the harts and minds of the group or I can pack up my toys and go home.
Say I decide to fight. After much work, & many messages I prove that Phil's statements are untrue & manage to convert the group to my side. My reputation has now been greatly inhanced and Phil's reputation has suffered.
In the current system if one repetitively post slander to a group his reputation will be distroyed beyond all repair. There is a genuine disincentive against slander in a system built on reputation. No additional "forces" are needed. The addition of libel laws would actually hurt such a system. The threat of a libel suite could be used to inhibit debate on a topic or questioning of ones reputation. MR/2 Tag->Windows: The Gates of hell.

The form of Government that our Founding Fathers created here in the US was based on
the principle that the citizens were educated, informed, God fearing people with
solid moral principles.
We no longer have such a society if we ever did.
Our citizens are for the most part uneducated, ill-informed, with the moral fiber
that back in 1776 would have found the whole lot of them in stocks in the town
The two major cause of this have been public education & TV.
Now before I get flamed here let me explain my position. :)
Over the past 40-50 yrs. public education has been going down hill. To receive the
education that was once received from 12 yrs of school now requires 16 yrs. We are
graduating greater and greater numbers of students that do not have the basic skills
to survive in the workplace.
There is little or no instruction on government, law, or the Constitution in school.
The majority of citizens are ignorant of the law, of the Constitution (both State &
Federal), of their local government. Incase you doubt this go out and ask some of
your fellow citizens who is on their town counsel, county boards, state
representatives. Ask them how local judges are selected. Who are their local judges
and what are their positions on key political issues.
Now on moral fiber & God fearing:
Every society has recognize that there were some basic rules it's citizens had to
live by inorder for them to survive. Now there can be some debate over individual
rules or how they should be inforced but all societies have agreed that there were
rules that the group as a whole had to live by.
The three major ones:
Don't Kill
Don't Steal
Don't Lie
A majority of our current laws come from these 3 basic principles.
Unfortunately our children are not being taught this. They are not being taught this
by their parents, they are not being taught this by the schools, and the majority of
airtime on TV is teaching them just the opposite.

I will agree with you about the taboo on political assassinations. Even the Mossad

I haven't used PGP-Domo but I have run a PGP mailing list using my own

You can cut down on some of the overhead by encrypting the message with
multiple keys but this increases messages size. If you have a large # of
subscribers you may wish to break up your encryption into blocks, say 25
keys per message. I think it will depend on your system on how may
subscribers & messages you could handle on a daily basis. Say a user base
of 1000 subscribers with 100 messages/day that's 100,000 encryptions per
day. While I think this would be doable on a PC you would have some
serrious lag. For a large subscription base I would go to a digest format.
This would cut down those 100 messages to say 5-10 digests. This would get
you to 5-10,000 encryptions which would be much more doable.
On the mailing list that I am running I only have 4-5 messages a day with a
user base of ~130 so volume has not been a problem. :)

The overwhelming cases of child abuse including pediophilia are not done by
strangers but by members of the childs family or those close to the family;
freinds, daycare workers, neighbors, cleargy, ...ect. Those with close
contact to the child on a regular basis. Any regulation on the Internet
would do nothing to prevent this. It would be just as easy to lure a child
by using the Postal system but you don't see anyone demanding that all
letters be written on postcards to they can be read.
I can see no way of regulating such information. The basic information
required to make all kinds of nasty bombs & chemicals are taught in High
School chemistry classes. I guess we could ban all science and go back to
living in caves but that doen't see very practical now does it?

Well there are two opposing camps on the Constitution.
On one side you have the Libertarian view that the Constitution is a
limiting document. The Federal government only has the power that is
explicitly granted and no more.
On the other side we have the view you have presented that unless
explicitly denied the Federal Government can do anything it pleases.
Anyone who has studied the writings of our Founding Fathers can clearly
see that they intended for the Constitution to be a limiting document. The
States had just finished fighting a long war against an oppressive,
distant centralized government had had no intentions of creating another
one in its place.

Well you are complicating the issue by assuming that we are in two
different states. If you and I are citizens of the same State you do not
have the right to deny me my rights protected under the Constitution of
the United States of America regardless wether you are in the majority
view or not. Of cource the laws of one State do not have power over
another State.
I do not consider the Bill of Rights as giving me "privileges" but giving
me immunity from any government restricting those rights.
Article. IV.
Section. 2.
Clause 1:  The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to
all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States. Section. 4. The United States shall guarantee to every
State in this Union a Republican Form of Government, and shall protect
each of them against Invasion; and on Application of the
Legislature, or of the Executive (when the Legislature cannot be convened)
against domestic Violence. Article. VI.
Clause 2:  This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which
shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall
be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme
Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any
Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary
notwithstanding. I think that this clause more than any other shows exactly where the
States stand. So long as a law passed by Congress is in accordance with
the Constitution the States are obligated to obey such laws regardless of
the Laws & Constitutions of the States.

 I have yet presented an argument for nor against the need for the
14th Amendment. This has been your own private one man circle jerk.
The position I presented was that the States do not have the power to deny
its citizens the rights protected under the Constitution of the United
States and the Bill of Rights. Rather than debate the validity of this
position you have conjured up this irrelevant issue of wether or not the
14th Amendment was/is needed.
Whenever you sober-up and come back down to reality we can debate the
issue at hand.
FWIIW I do not believe that the 14th Amendment was needed IMHO as the
rights of the citizens were guaranteed under previous articles of the
Constitution. Once again taking into account the political climate after
the civil war the Congress felt that this needed to be more clearly spelt
out via the 14th amendment in an effort to insure that the recently freed
blacks received the same protections under the law as the rest of the
citizens (13th & 15th Amendments were of similar nature).

If all the spam & flames are filtered out from the list and we only see the
"good" side of the posters then they will tend to gain greater reputation
capital then they deserve.
I do find the accusation that Sandy blocked the posting of a message critizing
the company he works for rather troubling. Though there are several

2 - Snafu. As I am sure everyone here is aware of that this happend more often

The second and and even more deadly factor in the demise of the list was that
John & Sandy listened to these sheep. If there was such a great demand for a

Those who wanted the services of Sandy to censor the list would have been free

a cypherpunks-flams & a cypherpunks-unsensored lists were created. These list
were created with the promise that anything that did not make it onto the main

this brew-ha-ha could have been avoided if Sandy had just posted a message to

of censorship by Sandy and supported by John is what has brought cypherpunks to

@_subject: Experiments on Mailing Lists 
Thought that I would add a few statistics on cypherpunks list filtering.
Since this afternoon I received 70 messages from the mailing list.
Of those 70 28 went into my twit folder (40%).
Of those 28:
- 2 anonymous posts:
    1 was moved back to my cypherpunks folder
    1 was Tim May slander message
- Remaining 26 belonged to 4 users on my twit list (non spam)
42 of 70 made it past my filter into my cypherpunks folder (60%).
Of those 42:
- 4  were spam that got past my filter.  I only filter repeat offenders. - 12 were
on Controlling spam on the list
- 6  were on ITAR/EAR
- 3  were on SSL Spoofing
- 3  were on Tim May/Cryptoanarchy
- 3  were on Ecash
- 2  were on OCR
- 2  were on California Inet Law
- 1  was on Secret Sharing
- 6  were on misc topics
I have found that by filtering out a handfull of users plus anonymous posts the list
becomes quite manageable. As far as spam goes I don't think there is any solution other
than the delete key. A good % of the time one can tell from the message topic that it is
spam and can delete the message without opening it.
As far as the issue of paying to download unwanted messages. One a user gets a good feel
for who the want to filter out they should be able to create a
killfile on their ISP's server.

I have designed a system that will automate most of the more dificult aspects of managing
PGP and buliding a "web of trust". It's based on the user obtaining a copy of the keyring
from one of the pgp servers and uptating it on a regular basis. This is automated by using
both e-mail request and http request from the pgp servers. The user then uses 3 keyrings:
pubring.pgp -- Small keyring contianing the most used keys mainly key used for
               encryption.
sigring.pgp -- Medium size keyring containing keys used only for verifying sigs.
master.pgp --  Copy of pubring.pgp from pgp key server.
Logs are kept of all signatures verified. After the same signature has been
verified X number of times the public key is added to the sigring.pgp. If a
key has not been used in X number of days it is removed from the sigring.pgp.
A simmilar log can be kept for encryptions & moving keys in and out of the
If the user not verifying a large number of sigs. the sigring.pgp & the
pubring.pgp can be combined.
There should also be some type of mechanisim to remind the user to verify keys that he
frequently uses.
All the above is handled transparently to the user after the inital set-up via a GUI
install program. Most of the mechanics are handled through a colection of e-mail
filters/scripts and a few small EXE's that I have written.
I have most of the code written and am in the process of working the kinks out.
The whole ideal of this is to keep the minimum # of keys in the users pubring & sigring
for usability while still having the master keyring as a backup.
I still need to develop a means of insuring that a key that is "trusted" by
association on the master keyring retains that trust when transfered to the
pubring.pgp. I think I can develop somthing along the lines of the ATT PathServer and calculate what keys need to be copyed along with the target key that is
being copied to the pubring.pgp.
As soon as I have a working model I will write somthing up in greater detail
and make it available on my web page.

In a random series of digits knowing p-1 should not have any effect on the

With e if you know the value of p-1 is 7 then you can calculate the value of p and know if
p is 3 or not. In a random series knowing that p-1 is 7 there should be an equal

I think this goes back to the topic of reputation capital. IMHO the occational message

While a complete ban all of ones posting or even a majority of ones posts making it to the
'flames list' could/would have a detrimtal
Hmmmm... Actually there could be an intresting side affect of a moderated list to a
posters reputation. Lets take the following example:
John Doe likes posting rants & flames 90% of the time. The other 10% of the
time he posts intelegent messages. Now on an un-moderated list a majority of
subscribers would get tierd of his rants, write him off as a kook and kill-file him. His
10% of intelegent posts would be lost in the 90% of noise and his
reputation would be adversly effected within the group.
Now on a moderated list the 90% of rants & flames would never be seen by the
list only the other 10%. His would wind up having a much higher reputation
among the group compaired to if all his posts were seen. I am not quite sure how to judge this effect. Should one take into account
the kooky behavior of a poster when veiwing his 'non kooky' posts? Does
moderation have a detrimental effect to establishing a reputation based system for a group
(how would Don Woods reputation faired if his rant's on OTP's
& ISP had been filtered out?)
IMHO this is sheepish though I have noticed it before moderation started.
If I have somthing to post to the list I see no reason to justify why I am

no appoligies for it. Do I think it is relevant to the list? Yes otherwise

little good except as a stepping stone to maditory rating system because
they are unable to solve the precieved problem of children accessing

You have two major groups pushing for rating systems:
1) Lazy parents that do not wish to be bothered with the obligations of
raising their children.
2) "Born again" censors like Rice want the power to control what people

The problem is that no rating system can satisfy these groups. Just as
voluntary rating will be used as a stepping stone to manditory rating,
manditory rating will be used by these same two groups for the outright
baning of certian forms of speech (their true agenda).

think that the overall quality of the newsgroups would decline if you

It should be noted that the Bandwith issue is a red-herring. It is an
antiquated concept from the Fidonet days and does not apply. The bandwith
of the USENET has been *PAID IN FULL* by every subscriber to an ISP. The
ISP customers pay for their connections to their ISP who in turn pay for
their connections to the Access providers who inturn pay for the Backbone.
The PIPE has been paid for what goes over it not an issue. If all I want
to do with my T1 connection is ship *.jpg files via ftp 24/7 that is no
ones busines but my own. If I chooses to use my bandwith to transmit a
variety of file formats using various protocols
(HTTP,FTP,GOFFER,ARCHIE,...ect) who are you to say that some formats are
good and some are not!! (this is not even getting into the content of the
data being shiped).
There is a web site that is doing exactly this. They provide forums for
users to post technical questions in which "experts" will answer them.
Upon receiving the answer the person who posted the question is requested
to rate the answer. I haven't been on the site in awhile but the last time
I was there they were working on a mechinism to compensate their "experts"
for answering questions. They had a point system based on the difaculty of
the questions. After registering with them and obtaining a certain number
of points for correctly answering questions you would be classified as an
"expert" for that forum which then would make you eligable for
compensation. I believe all funds were to be generated through web page
I'll see if I can find the URL for the site and post it to the list.

Well there are some distinct differences between a Utility
(Electric,Water,Gas) and that of Ineternet bandwith.
With a public utility the greatest expence is not in providing the pipe
(bandwith) but in generating the resources (electric,water,gas). The
oppisite of this is true with the internet. The monthy telco charges for
prividing the bandwith is much more than the cost's of providing the
resources (data).
I think a closer analogy to the Internet is that of a highway system
(Information Highway, who knew? ). You have the upfront expence of
building the highway (bandwith) and then the expences of up-keep &
maintinance (telco charges - profit).
Now we have two camps for how this should be paid for. Should the users
pay upfront for a certian amuont of usage (This is basicaly how it is
today) or should users pay a metered rate simmilar to a toll-road.
I myself prefer to pay a flat rate and make use of my time & bandwith as I
see fit than to pay on a metered rate. I remember years back with
Compu$erve paying a metered rate and getting +$100 mo. bills from them.

Well the ISP may have 200 customer for the T1 line but they woun't have
200 dial up lines per T1 (at least not one that wishes to stay in business
long). Now how many dial-up lines per T1 a ISP will have will depend on
the traffic analysis for his customer base. There is nothing wrong with
oversubscribing his bandwith because he knows that all his cutomers will
not be on-line all the time using 100% of their 28.8 dial-up bandwith.
What an ISP does have to provide for is enough bandwith to be able to
handle the amount of dial-ups he has available. If an ISP has 200 dial-up
lines then he best provide enough T1's to be able to support them.
The same is true for Access providers. If an access provider is servicing
20 T1's then he best have the bandwith to the backbone to provide the
bandwith that he has sold. He is collecting the $$$ to provide the service
he is obligated to provide it.
Now if an access provider does detailed analysis of his traffic and
determins that he needs only 4 T3's to provide service for 20 T1's and
therefore reduces his costs that's fine. But if one of his T1 customers
traffic increases he is obligated to add more bandwith on his end to
handle it.
This is what the whole bandwith issue comes down to. ISP & Access
providers atempting to maximise profits for given resources. This doesn't
nullify their obligations to their customers. If they sell T1 bandwith
24/7 to their customers then they are required to provide that service if
their customers demand it. The current movement to blaim users for using
the resources that they have been sold is wrong. It is no different that
if a car dealer sells you a 100,000 mile warrenty on a car then renigs on
the contract because he really didn't expect you to drive 100,000 miles

IMHO the request for SS numbers are usally done out of convieniance more
than anything else. This is not to justify it just an explanation why so
many palces request SS numbers.
Anyone that has written database software where unique information is
stored on individules a SS number is quite convienat as everyone has a
unique one. Most employee, payroll, medical, insurance, credit, databases
use SS numbers rather than create individule id  One's SS number has 2
unique qualities that make it perfect for this use: 1 every person has a
unique  and 2 it never changes. This can not be said for any other
identifiers one may use, names, addresses, DL  ...ect all have the
possiablity to change over time while your SS # is forever. By using SS #
as id  makes communication of data between diffrent database all that
much simpler. From personal experiance I can testify that the entier
Medical Insurance system is based on using SS # as identification. I
shudder to think trying to track medical records of patients over a period
of years between different doctors, hospitals, insurance companies without
using them.
I will not go into the privacy issues involved in using SS  for id as I am sure the members of the list are quite familiar with them. I just
wanted to point out that in some industries there is a technical advantage
to having 1 universal id Now with that being said I personally would not shead any tears seeing SS

 This is really no suprise considering who is issueing the numbers.
This is rarely a problem from a data managemant posistion as SS # are key
fields. Any attempts at adding duplicates produces errors which then have
to be resolved usally manually by human intervention. Rarely are SS used exclusivly but in combination with other data (name & DOB is usaully
I doubt that 2 or more SS# would be issued delibratly. The only reason for
multiple SS would either be screw-ups by SSA or by design of the person
applying for the SS I imagine that new SS# may be issued in some special
cases such as witeness relocation, perhaps after adoption, but then the
old SS# is not being used so it is not really an issue.
For all practical purposes it is. with the exception of screw-ups by SSA
ones SS # is unique and with the exception of a few rare cases mentioned
above it never changes. compare this to other identifiers and it is
obviously the most convienient id # available. Atleast 50% of the
population has 1 name change durring the cource of their lifes, Addresses
change numerious times during an average americans lifetime, and DOB's are
not unique enough to be used.
While problems do exsist with using SS as id they are quite small when
compaired to using other less stable data to generate id Really much to complex to be of use not to mention the lack of reliable
data to form the id The use of DOB + Geographic Identifier + Unique Code would work quite
19970601 - DOB.
0123     - Sample Geographic Identifier (say NY City).
0142     - Unique Code added to handle collisions of the above two.
I beleive that this is very simmilar to what the SSA uses though I beleive
that they only encode the year of birth when calculating SS  Using Hex
rather than decimal for encoding would help greatly in redicing the number
of digits required. I would imagine that the SSA will have to go to a Hex
or complete Alphanumeric codings system as the population increases.

If you don't want your children to get blown up don't put them in
harms way. The government *KNEW* that this building was the target of
numerious groups. They especially knew that it was a major risk on that
day. They did nothing to warn the occupants of the building.
This is no different than palcing a daycare center in a munition factory
durring a time of war and then blaming the bomber pilots for blowing up
The Judge of the McVeigh case said himself in his instructions to the jury
that there was no evidence that McVeigh knew of the day care center in the
building. McVeigh was going after the ATF agents in the building (all of
which were conviently gone at the time of the bombing).
A just where were your tears for the children that were burned alive by
the ATF in Waco or the children of Weaver guned down by sinpers at Ruby
Ridge? I guess it only ok to kill children if it's the Federal Government
doing it.

For the most part thoses labeled as "terrorist" are the one who are

First off they did not lie in wait for anyone. They were in their home not

several times without incedent. There was no reason to suspect that
another vist would have gone any different. Instead the BATF went in there
like an invading army with guns blazing and rightfully got their asses
handed to them.
Last time I looked (horror of horrors) guns are still *LEGAL* in this
country. As far as child abuse there was no evidence of this other than
the word of 1 disgruntaled former member of their group. Even if the

was called for was a vist by a Human Services Case Worker not a military
All this aside I guess you feel that the Feds should be able to wage

Hi Jim,
Lets drop the analogies for a moment. :)
Now if I understand you (and feel free to correct me) this is what you
wish to do:
I as Joe Sixpack want to goto You as goodie-2-shoes want to picket this site.
Inorder to do this you wish to have me goto  and see
their anti-porn page before I can see the bigtits page. (wether I actually
goto their website or the page is automatically downloaded is irrelevant
for the disscusion).
Now as Joe Sixpack I do not want to see the anit-porn page from the NOW I
want to see the bigtits page at Where exactly is it in the constution that say that your free speech
rights extend to the point where you can force me to read what you have to
say when I don't want to?
I just don't see how you can make this leap regardless of who is doing the
BigTits have their 1st Amendment rights to free speech the same as the
NOW. BigTits puts up their web site & NOW puts up theirs. I now can make
my choice of who's speech I wish to listen to. If I decide to listen to
BigTits that is my right to do so and if I want to listen to NOW that is
also my right.
I'll leave the numerous analogies alone for a latter post. I just don't
see where anyone has the right to tell me what I must read.

Well this is why I had wanted to set the analogies aside. There are some
real diferences between cyberspace and your metaspace analogy of the
picket line. In cyberspace there is no sidewalk for your picket to stand
and for me to pay as little or as much attention as I wish.
A more closer analogy between cyberspace and metaspace is that your
picketors are not standing off to the side but are blocking the door and
the only way I can enter is to read their signs first. This is the point
where your picketors have oversteped the bounds of their 1st Amendment
rights. While the have the right to picket infront of the store they
cannot interfere with the comming and goings of the customers. The has
been well tested in the courts. The problem with extending the picket
analogy to cyberspace is there are no sidewalks. It's all or nothing.
Either you are blocking the door or you are not.

Well I guess I should let the cat out of the bag, :)
I have been working on addressing this very problem.
I haven't had time to write a formal paper on this but I can give you some
of the basics.
It makes use of a stego of sorts. Alice would post a message to a non
threating mailing list. In that list certain key words would be
misspelled. Carol would use these key words to tell her to look for a
certain message posted anonymously & encrypted in a newsgroup (stego in a
gif file to a binary group works quite well).
Now it would be possiable to track that Alice was sending messages to a
remailer there would be no way to track that Carol was receiving these
messages. At best it would be know that Carol was a reader of
alt.binaries.japan.cartoons or some other non-threating newsgroup.
Now this requires both Carol & Alice to be running the same software for
generating the spelling stegos and interperting them. It helps if Alice
has the reputation of being a very bad speller (ha and you all laughed at
my spelling mistakes). The use of a special dictionary that contains
common mispellings of common words is a great aid but I have yet to find
one in electronic form. An OTP should be generated and used as a seed to
the software to keep the two systems in synch. This can be encrypted &
stegoed and posted to a pre-selected newsgroup. Once the inital synching
of the two systems have been acomplished new pads can be generated and
distributed by the same mechanisims.
This does not protect Alice from comming under the guns for using a
remailer nor does it provide a way for Carol to reply. The anonymous
remailers could be completly bypassed and both Carrol and Alice could do
all communication through stegoed newsgroup postings. Alos mailing list
need not be used but the plaintext messages could be posted via
newsgroups. There is a reliabilty issue going this route (from my personal
experaince mailing list are more reliable than newsgroups YMMV).
The details of applying such a system is more complex but the above gives
you the basics of it.

Well down here in Pensacola where we like to shoot abortion doctors I
beleive that there is a 50' seperation (other side of the street). I don't
know how the courts would rule but from past rulling against picketors
interfering with the customers of a business I would tend to dissagree. To
be honest I am not up on which way the wind is blowing in the courts on
this issue.
I do feel that the delay is unconstutional. It is where the fine line
between your and my 1st amendment rights cross. The size and amount of
delay is irrelevant from a constitutional standpoint (can't be a little
bit pregnet can't be a little bit unconstitional).
This is where are disagreement over the picket analogy rest. Inoreder for
the picket analogy to be extended to cyberspace it requires me to download
someone's elses speech before I can download the speech that I want to
hear. In metaspace there is a sidewalk for the picketers to stand and I
can pass them by without slowing down never hearing what they have to say.
Here localy I have them well trained, when they see my vette they know not
to block the driveway as I will not slow down for them (actually the sound
of the 427 is enought to get them moving off to the side).

Fraud, which is just a special case of theift (theift by deception).
What you are selling is not borshch but a cure for cancer (which happens
to be borshch). Since your cure does not work this is seen as fraud which
is theift and thus the government steps in.
No if some disintrested 3rd party claims that borshch cures cancer, and
you sell borshch, there is no fraud if the borshch does not cure cancer as
you are just selling borshch which is all the you claimed it was. The 3rd
party is not guilty of fraud as they have not entered into any contractual
agreement with the buyer of the borshch.

Well this is why I tell everyone to clear sign the message first and then

behavior. IMHO encrypting & signing (-sea) is a PITA (for the reciever).
I also verify signatures of all signed inbound messages and append the
output from PGP to the bottom of the message so that you can see the
results when the message is opened without having to re-run PGP.
The user also has the option to either decrypt messages as they are
retreived or to store them encrypted.
I just released the first beta of my auto-encrypt code. That was quite fun
to write. Myself am rather disturbed by how many PGP/E-Mail implmentations
handle signing/encrypting of messages. One of my biggest pet peeves is
when only the plain text of a message is signed/encrypted. I have seen
this with more than 1 implementation and I see it as a serrious security
Another issue that is usally missed is Bcc's. The whole purpose of using
Bcc's is that you don't want the rest of your distribution to know that
you have sent a copy to the addresses on the Bcc line. If you encrypt a
message with multiple keys including keys for your Bcc's then your Bcc's
will be known to everyone who recieves a copy of the message.
What I have done to address this is to send seperate copies of the message
to each address on the Bcc list each encrypted with only the one key for
the address.
You can have the strongest algorithms in the world but they do you no good
if they are poorly implemented.

There is no comparison between the two. For better or worse there are

there is a 3' drop ceiling that anyone can use to climb over the door
with. If that had been $5,000 cash rather than that laptop I bet your

stolen equipment. The market is for inexpensive used equipment which
theifs take advantage of. This is an important difference to make. The
amount of stolen equipment in the used equipment market is quite small.
The end buyer should not be held responcible for the illegal activities of
the seller.

Well yes, :)
There are different levels of trust and authentication in the web of
Many (most?) people using PGP will never physically meet and authenticate
keys. Their security model does not require this. Instead what PGP is used
for is a verification method that I am talking to the same person at
tcmay at got.net in my correspondance even though I do not know who he is
physically. So over a period of time of exchanging PGP signed messages I
can authentincate that all of these messages are all comming from
tcmay at got.net who claims to be Tim May. I know that this is not much but
at least I know it's not Dimitri or someone else forging the messages from
that account (though I don't know if all this time tcmay at got.net has
really been one of Dimitri's accounts and that Tim May is really dead).
I also use PGP to sign all my distributed source code & binaries for my
programs. I also sign all my posts. My sharware customers can verify that
the software if from me and unmodified and can also verify any public post
regarding the software. Depending on how concerned on this they may be
satisfied that seeing the code signed with the same key that I use for my
mailing list and in all my public post as enough authentication that the
code is valid (though there is nothing preventing them from taking
stronger methods of authentication upto and including flying down to FL
and meeting me in person).
You also have PGP add-on software that does lookups of keys by e-mail
address. This is a convient feature if one is working with large keyrings.
You do run into the problem of e-mail addresses changing and having
multiple keys with the same address. In my software I make use of a
default file where a key can be assinged to an e-mail address regardless
of what is in the userid. YMMV with other software, from my own testing I
have found that most will either take the first key found with duplicats
or complain of "no key found" with address changes.

Well Kent we must be reading from two different dictionaries:
infringe: to encroach upon in a way that violates law or the rights of
encroach: to enter by gradual steps or by stelth into the possessions or
rights of another.
By the above definition this is exactly what the government has been doing
with it's ever increasing restictions on the possesions of guns by it's
citizens and what the founding fathers wished to posses. If they had
wanted the government to have the power to control and regulate the
ownership of guns then they would have said so.
The Bill of Rights were not added to the Constitution to give the
government more power but to restrict their power.
The whole purpose of the 2nd Amendment was to provide a final check &
balance on the government. Our founding fathers were all too aware that it
was manditory that the population must be well armed inorder preserve
their freedom against an unjust government.
An unarmed people are just so much sheep waiting for the slaughter.

This point I was trying to make was that the renter of property should not
be held resposable for "illegal" items that may be on that property
without his knowledge.
Since every truck I have ever rented included a physical inspection of the
truck (basically to note all the dents and dings that were already there)
it would be hard to say that you had no knowldge of the trailer being
filled with coke (well it would be easy to say but no one would beleive
you). Such inspections do not include checking ashtrays, cracks between
the seats, taking off the door pannels, ...ect and the renter should not
be held responcible unless it could be *proved* that he was the one that
put the items there and not someone else.
Now you are being silly and not to the point of the disscusion. This was
not about wether possession of a "roach" should be more or less legal than
100K of coke. The point was wether the renter should be held accountable
for possesion of "illegal" substances that he had no prior knowledge of.

I have been doing somthing much simpler for providing an encrypted IRC.
Say you have a group of 5-10 crypto-anarchsist who wish to engage in a

1 of the group runs ircd & sshd on his machine (perferabley the one with
the fastest machine/and or best connection).    The rest of the group logs into his machine using irc & ssh clients.
All communication is encrypted to the outside world while in "plain text"
to the group.
The best part of this is it requires no modification to the "off the
shelf" software available.
Unfortunatly ssh is not very well known outside the Unix community. There
is an exelent port for OS/2 (freeware) and there is a port to winxx
(shareware) I don't know if a mac port is available.

For C, H & CMD files you can clear sign the text files and still be able

Now the PGP Signature has been commented out of the source code so it will
not interfere with compiling. The end user can verify the signature
without any modifications.
I don't know if this will work with other languages that use different
dilimiters. It all depends if you have the ability to comment out a block
of text or if you need to add a dilimiter to every line.

The state is not allowed to engage in secret activities with select
members of society. Whenever it issues a permit or a license to someone it
is public knowledge. Whenever someone is arrested, whenever there is a
trial both great and small the full details are public information.
All actions of the state *must* be reviewable by the citizens. You can not
have a free and open society without the people being able to check on
what it's government is doing.
This means that all of the following *must* be open to the public:
DMV Records
Criminal Records
Voter Registrations
Census Records
Building Permits
Profesional Licenses
Court Transcripts
Federal Records
State Records
County Records
City Records
ect, ect, ect.
The problem here is *NOT* that this information is public. The problem is
that the goverment has got it's fat little fingers into everything. The
solution is *NOT* letting the state hide what it is doing with these so
called privacy laws but to get the state out of where it has no business
being in the first place!!!
And this has nothing to do with GAK or any other 1984ish monitoring of
citizens. The issue here is bringing the activities of the state into the
light of day. The activities of the citizens that do not directly involve
the state are not at issue here.

I don't want to get to deep into this curency issue but from my experiance
not all exchanges are done at a cost.
This is directly related to the stability of the curency being exchanged.
If I am exchanging US $ with a low inflation rate (say 4%) for IT lira
with a high inflation rate (say 250%) it is to the advantage of the person
holding the lira to give me a good rate of exchange for my stable dollars.
Also if I may not actually need to make the exchange at all as many Italin
merchants would prefer to be paid in US $ rather than IT lira and will
discount his services on the simple fact that I am paying him in stable
curency. From my travels I have found whole cities where there is an
underground economy all in US $ because the local curency is worthless.
These areas tend to have a thriving barder system also for the same
reasons (a loaf of bread is still worth a loaf of bread regardless what
the pinheads in the government do to screw up the economy).
Where I see the cost of exchange is when dealing with curencies that are
of relativly the same stablilty US $ (4%) Japan Yen (6%). Then there is
not the overwhelming advantage to the person holding the Yens to exchange
for the US $.
There are exceptions to this also. Say you have Widgets Inc (USA) & Cogs
LTD. (Japan) who do a large amount of business in each others countries
and between each other. It may be to their advantage to accept purchaces
in each others currencies as to avoid the cost & hassels of going through
Just some food for thought. :)
PS: the inflation rates were just given as examples I have no ideal what

Children do not have the same rights that adults do under the constitution

children because they have become inconvient? NO. Should I be able to
punish my child without fear of retribution by a bunch of nardoweller

They have NO right to do so! They are my children and I will rase them as

and most definatly not how the scumbags in Washington see fit!! (Would you

It's not a matter of an ideal society as the can never be obtained due to
the fact we all have different ideals on what that society should be.  My
point is that from the dawn of time since man climbed out of the trees it
has been the parents would raised & were responcible for their children. It
has only been recient with the advent of the Socialist that the belief that
children should be raised by the STATE in cookie cutter fasion.
No perhaps I should have worded it better. I was tring to highligh that
such STATIST beliefs were at direct odds with the the beliefs of freedom &

Senate Judiciary Committe -- 08 May 1997

Under current Federal Law 5yrs can be tacked on to a criminal sentance if a
gun is used in the commision of a crime. Now they have a new twist to add:
"constructive" possession of a gun during the commision of a crime.
Now what does "constructive" possession mean?
Well according to those who testified from the various depts of the
Excutive Branch it means that a gun happens to be in the area, or the
potential to use a gun or if you recoment that someone else use a gun
durring the commission of a crime even though the weapon was never used.
Some examples given:
If durring the planning of a bank robbery you recomend that a gun be used
durring the robbery even though you did not use the weapon or was not even
present durring the robbery you could still get the extra 5yrs.
If durring a drug deal taking place in the back seat of a car there is a
gun under the front seat of the car you would still get the extra 5yrs even
though the the gun was never used.
If durring a drug raid on your home and a gun is found anywhere in the
house, yes you would be elegible for the extra 60 months.

I am just finishing up my script to collect, log, & merge the two lists. I
hope to add in the news groups also to produce a daily cypherpunks digest.
I should have somthing up and running after I meet a production deadline
this weekend.
I could add some list analysis to my code producing a weekly and/or daily

Let me know what kind of info you would like to see in the report and I
will see what I can come up with.
Also what would be a good size to split the daily digest at if it gets too

Every bill that *is not* passed by congress is just that much more freedom
that is saved. If all the bills passed by congress over the past 100yrs.
could all be repealed no one would miss them in the least (well no one
except the STATEST). SAFE was a bad ideal as any law regulating crypto. I do not need DC's

I have been doing some work in this area and IMHO the above is not enough
to properly weed out the duplicates. Not that it woun't catch them but it
will also throw out some non duplicate messages. I would recomend that the
criteria be extended to include the seconds in the time stamp (4:34:25). If
the seconds are not available perhaps generating a hash of the messages
body and compairing would work.
I'm not trying to quibble but I have seen in the past where an author will
post a message and there will be multiple replies to the message. The
author will then reply to the replies and several of these messages will
have the only difference will be the seconds on the time stamp.
Awhile back on one of my e-mail client list their was a disscussion on
wether the time stamp of a message should be generated at the time the
message is composed or at the time the message is sent. We had come to the
conclution that the time the message was composed was the best route to
take. Other e-mail clients may have taken the other route which would
increase the chances on non duplicate messages haveing the same hour:min in
the time stamp.

Well I was not thinking of Constitutional Amendments when I made my
orriginal statement as they require ratification by the States to become
law. After thinking on it awhile though I think it would be vailid to
include some of them. I don't have a copy of the Constitution handy so I
will try to address them from memory.
Voting Amendments:
If I recall right there was nothing in the constitution that prevented
women from voting. This was done through state law. I beleive with the
growing support of the sufferget movemnet in the country at the time that
this issue would have been resolved either at the state level or through SC
rulling that the states were acting unconstitionally. I beleive that this
is how the Jim Crow and other state voting laws were abolished.
I do think that droping the voting age from 21 to 18 was a good thing. If
you are old enough to fight and die for your country you should be old
enough to vote for/against the bastards that are getting you killed.
Anti-Discrimination Amendments:
While I think that it was a good thing to abolish State enforced
discrimination I do not like the intrusion into the private sector that has
been a result. I beleive that there is a "right of association" that every
individule has. I should be able to determin who I associate with on
whatever basis I chose to make that determinination. I could go on for
pages on this subject but I beleive that overall such legislation has hurt
the Black community more than it has helped it.
I never questioned that such things went on. Much of this was enforced by
law which was wrong.
Well since I haven't rode the bus in years I really can't confirm or deny
this. I don't recall this when I rode the L and buses in Chicago but then
again it was not somthing I really paid attention to. (Personaly I prefer
riding towrads the back of the bus but it does not have the stigma
associated with it that it may for others).
Heh, I do this quite often. :) As an avid Jazz & Blues fan and so-so
Corrnet player I have frequented "black" bars in Chicago, KC, St. Louis,
Houston, & New Orleans. I never experinced any problems outside of the
normal things that happen if you spend enough time in the bars.
I also consider myself a fairly good pool player which tends to bring me
into "black" bars and pools halls on a regular basis.
Now if you are talking of some hole-in-the-wall right around the corner
from the projects then no I do not frequent such places late at night but I
doubt that many middle class black do either. Well there was an after hours
joint I used to go to on Galviston but stoped going after the guy I was
talking to got his kneecap blown off. I decided it was much wiser just to
get a carryout at 2am. :)
Absolutly. I have always beleived that the only color that truely matters
in this country is green. If a company or indivdule does not ingage in a
policy that you support then vote with your wallet. This brings me back to
my orriginal message. Things did not start to change in this country until
the Black community, with the support of many whites, rallied together and
refused to accept the status quo. This is why things started to change back
in the 60's not because of legislation from DC. The polititions were merly
jumping on the bandwagon.

If Congress was intrested in doing the "right thing" then law they should

Unconstitutional and by an Act of Congress is Repealed.
This is not what they are doing. What they are saying with SAFE is that you
have no Constitutional Rights on this issue but because we are nice guys we
are going to pass a law making it legal, oh by the way we are going to tack
a few riders on here for our own purposes.
The whole approach to this issue is wrong. There is *no* valid law

My biggest concern with the pay as you go approach is 2 fold:
1. It woun't stop Spamford and his ilk as they are the ones who have the

2. Once the jennie is out of the bottle you will see everyone's cost go up

Yes unfortunatly I nolonger have that thread. If you could give me a date
that was posted I will look at the archives.
Perhaps criminal trespass was a little extreme on my part though no new
laws would be required for such a prosecuition.
I am not looking for the governmental intrusions that you have listed
above. They are not needed to take care of Spamford. I as the owner of
certain computer equipment have the right to determin who uses such
equipment and how. It should be no different that my right to determin who
can enter my house and who can not. If I inform Spamford that he is not
welcome in my house and he still insists on comming in I should have some
recource to stop him.
IMHO this can be taking care of through civil courts hitting the spamers
where it counts in the wallet. As far as identification this is quite
simple to do without the above measure. Even if Spamford uses tricks to
cover his tracks his clients are known as they tell you who they are in
their spam. Traceing back to Cyber-Momo is trivial once his clients are
known. IMHO when Compu$erve suied Spamford thay should have listed all of
his customers in the lawsuit.
No it was not. Just because you leave a door unlocked does not mean that
anyone has the right to enter. If you run into the store and forget to
lock the doors on your car does that mean that anyone has the right to
drive off in your car? If you leave the front door unlocked on your house
does that mean that anyone can walk in and help themselfs to the contents
of your house?
I never have argued for more legislation of the internet for any reason. I
just think that creative use of current laws can put an end to this
pestilance. I don't see remailers being hurt in this as the whole purpose
of spam is to be non-anonymous (you can't sell anything if they don't know
where to send the money to). I do think that litigation can be used
effectivly to put an end to Spamford without changing the current
structure of the internet.
The whole spam issue could be handled in a non hostile manner. Spamford et
al. could sign a contract with me to allow x amount of messages/day onto
my system for y $'s. I then could use these funds to compensate my users
with lower rates, better equipment, ...ect. Other ISP's could chose not to
allow spam on their systems and use this as a marketing tool. Some users
would like the lower rates and tolerate the spam others would opt to go
with a no-spam ISP. Either way everyone comes out a winner. Unfortunatly
Cyberpromo and other such companies have decided that they can have a free
lunch at others expence.

I'm not quite sure how one could counter against such an attack. Even if

protions of the HD that the OS will require to be unencrypted. Perhaps

Hi Ross,
With SPAM we have two seperate issues SPAM that shows up in public forums
newsgroups & mailling lists and SPAM that is directly mailed to
individules mail boxes.
SPAM that is posted to public forums is somthing that is hard to do
anything about without draconian measures that I doubt that few would want
to see.
SPAM that is sent directly to users mailboexs is somthing that can be
addressed without extreme measures. Either the Spamfords et al will have
to find a civilized approach to their advertisment or they will all be
gone in a couple of years. The Compuserver vs Cyberpromo lawsuit is only
the first of many. I would imagine that we will see more of these lawsuits
now that Compuserver has won theirs. I am currently receiving 5-10 SPAM
messages per day. Take a medium size ISP with 10,000 customers and you are
looking at 50-100k messages a day tying up resources that are not payed
for by the SPAMers. There is no reason why an ISP should have to support
someone elses advertisment.

 It's really a shame when Socialist/Statest try to use the "free
market" to justify big government.
Your example is *not* how the free market would address the issue. If the
Telco's tried to sell the contents of indivdule's phone calls there would
be an increased demand for encrypted phones. This demand would then be met
by the electroins/communication industry (granted there would be some lag
time between the initial selling of phone contents and the first
crypto-phones getting to market but hey nothings perfect).
Now if we had a truely free market in the Telco Industry the consumer
would have the choice between several telco compaines to deal with. If one
decided to start selling recordings of its customers phone conversations
it's customers would leave in droves to its competition.
This is just simple economics 101. You can't have a free society in a
socialist, federally regulated economy.
More government agencies, rules & regulations are *NEVER* a solution.
It's an intresting side note that the reason why the Cell Phones in this

What a sweet little scam they have going here. :)
While there product cost $99, which is not unreasonable for a security product of this nature, they charge $49 for the "OTP's" (I'll get to the OTP's later)!!!
Now they way they have this set-up is that for each person that you are communicating with requires a separate "OTP". The program comes with 2 "OTP's" and additional "OTP's" can be purchased for $49. So say you have 10 people you wish to communicate with you are talking almost $500 out the gate to get going!!! This is just silly.
Now to "OTP's". These are the things that snake-oil salesmen's dreams are made of. Here is how their sales pitch works (and i have seen many of them over the years):
1) OTP's are unbreakable
2) We use an OTP
3) Our program is unbreakable
4) You should use our program
I will address all three points of their sales pitch and show the flaws in it.
1) OTP's are unbreakable:
  To understand how one can make this claim (and it is true) on needs to understand what a OTP is and how it works.
A OPT (One Time Pad) is just a file of random numbers. That's it, nothing fancy here. To encrypt a message one takes the bits in the plaintext and an equal amount of bits from the OTP and XOR them together. The result is just another random file of bits. To get the plaintext back one takes the "encrypted" files and Xor's it with the same bits used the first time.
Quite simple but there is a catch:
  Your OTP must but TRULY RANDOM!! If there are any patterns in your "random" data you are dead in the water. The biggest flaw in products that claim to use OTP's is they use what is called a PRNG (pseudo random number generator). Unfortunately the data that PRNG's produce are not sufficiently "random" for use in OTP's. It has long been accepted in the field of cryptology that you *MUST* use a real world sample for random data, things like measuring the time intervals between click on a Geiger counter measuring background radiation.
A second catch:
  You must never, never reuse any of the bits from your OTP!!! As simple as this seems (after all this is why they call it an One Time Pad) there are programmers out there that fail to grasp this basic concept. Now AFAIK there is no pad reuse with this program. That's where their revenue stream is comming from charging you for the new pads!
So if you use truly random data (no PRNG's) and you never reuse bits then an OTP encrypted message is provably unbreakable.
2) We use OTP's
I have seen numerous claims by various "snake-oil" salesmen that their program uses an OTP only too see that they are using a PRNG to generate their "OTP". I even had one claim that it was ok to reuse his PRNG generated pad.
Now since the company provided no details on how they generate the OTP's who knows what they are doing.
3) Our program is unbreakable
Well if they are dotting all their I's and crossing all their T's when it comes to generating and using OTP's then yes the message is unbreakable.
But wait their program does not generate the OTP's you must buy them from the company!! This means that a 3rd party outside of you and the person you are communicating with has a copy of the pad!!! This is a big no-no in cryptology. Anyone who has access to the OTP can decrypt any message that was encrypted using it. What type of security do they have on site? Who has access to the OTP's?? How are they generated?? What are their policies if the government requests access to these OTP's?? All questions left unanswered by the company.
I must say that I seriously question the on-site security of the OTP's considering how the initial OTP's are sent to the customer, (drum roll please), the just MAIL them!!!!
This brings us to the third catch to using OTP's: How to exchange the pads.
Before the advent of Public Key Encryption this was the most daunting task in cryptology. How do you get the keys to the people who need them to decrypt the message??? With OTP's or any form of cryptology where the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt the message the user must find a "secure" channel for exchanging the keys. This is no different than a key to a house or a car, the same key is used to lock and unlock the door. Anyone who has a copy of the key can unlock the door. Need less to say you don't just send the key in the mail. Usually such exchanges are done in person or if this is not practical a "trusted" courier is used to exchange the key. Not very practical for every day use.
4) You should use our program
Consider the following:

@_subject: A Short History of Liberty 
Below is a copy of "A Short History of Liberty" by Dean Russell first
published in the Freeman in Jan 1955. Copied from "Essays in Liberty"
Volume III, published by the FEE (The Foundation for Economic Education,
Inc,) 1958.
"From Biblical times onward, the history of liberty and progress among
various peoples seems to have followed a remarkably similar pattern. there
are exceptions, of course-and the time element varies widely-but the
pattern may be generally described by ten key ideas in sequence:"
1. BONDAGE. At some point in their histories, all peoples seem to have
existed in some form of bondage or slavery-frequently even to their own
domestic rulers by their own votes or acquiescence. But when thoughtful
persons finally become aware that they are no longer free men, they want
to know why. When they ask themselves that question, they automatically
turn to contemplation and soul searching. Out of this grows ...
2. FAITH. If people in bondage have no faith-either in a personal Creator
or impersonal ideal-they will remain slaves and eventually die out or be
absorbed by another culture. But an intelligent faith will almost always
develop into ...
3. UNDERSTANDING. A person's faith needs to be buttressed by an
understanding of why it is evil to force any peaceful person to conform to
the will and ideas of another person. Otherwise, he is apt to remain a
faithful slave or attempt to become a slave-owner. But the combination of
faith and understanding results in the necessary ...
4. COURAGE. You may depend upon it, courageous men with faith and
understanding will neither remain in bondage nor keep others in bondage.
Even against great odds, this combination leads to ...
5. LIBERTY. Liberty is a relationship among persons wherein no person
molests any other peaceful person in his ideas, possessions, or actions.
Liberty may also be viewed as the responsibility one assumes for himself
and recognizes in all others, for there can be no liberty where there is
no responsibility. Liberty has never existed completely among any people
at any time; but where it has existed to a high degree, the resulting
freedom to work, trade, choose, win, lose, and bargain has always meant
6. ABUNDANCE. But if an abundance of material things is the primary aim of
a person, his life is devoid of any real meaning. For if the goal is
abundance, its achievement logically results in ...
7. COMPLACENCY. Complacency and self-satisfaction (the "full barns" of the
Biblical lesson) inevitably lead to ...
8. APATHY. With apathy comes a dullness and loss of interest-a "let George
do it" philosophy. And there will always be many political "Georges"
around to accept this invitation to seize both the reins and the whip.
This always degenerates into ...
9. DEPENDENCY. For a time, it is possible for dependents to be unaware
that they are dependents. As they continue to shed the personal
responsibilities which *are* freedom, they also continue to delude
themselves that they are still free people-"We never had it so good." Or
they may be deluded into believing that they are still free so long they
themselves are able to participate in the mechanical processes of
selecting their rulers-"We can still vote, can't we?" But dependents are
at the mercy of the persons or groups or parties upon whom they depend for
their housing, or security in old age, or subsidies, or education, or
medical care, or any of the other "aides" from political authority which
cause persons to depend on others instead of themselves. Sooner or later,
this dependency becomes know by its true nature ...
10. BONDAGE. Fortunately, the record shows that people can regain their
faith, understanding, and courage. They can again become persons and
citizens who are responsible for their own welfare, rather than units and
subjects identified by numbers for the purposes of regimentation and
subsidization. The record shows that people can, by their own intelligent
actions, regain their liberty any time they want it.

poison the crops and aid in the defeat of Germany. Luck for Europe this was never followed through.

Well part of the problem with using chemical agents is they are not very
efficient. This is a lesson that was learned in WWI and most likely was
the largest factor in them not being used durring WWII (durring WWI one
was just as likely to be hit by one's own gas as the enemy was).
It is even questionable as a terror weapon against civilian targets due to
the quantities that would be needed to attack a large city like London.
