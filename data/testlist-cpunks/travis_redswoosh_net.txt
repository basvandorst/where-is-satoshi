@_subject: [p2p-hackers] Why UDP and not TCP? 
The main reason P2P is moving toward reliable-flow-controlled-UDP is that
UDP allows for widely available straight forward techniques to route around
NATs in NAT-to-NAT file delivery scenarios.
I believe this was covered in the thread, but it may be such common
knowledge by now that we only refer to it implicitly.
Mangling TCP to implement similar traversal techniques is a substantially
more difficult task.  Though not impossible at all, it's a tricky bit of
hacking you'll need to do to make it work.
