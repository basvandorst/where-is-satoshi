@_subject: a test server? 
Is there a PGP test server anywhere?  I'd like to use its public key
to encrypt a message, mail it to the server, and have it mail the
plaintext back to me.  I'd also like to have it look up my pubic key
in the appropriate repository (which is?) and verify that my message
was signed properly.

   I'm not sure I understand what you are saying here.  Them being the laws or
   the government?
He's saying that power is granted to the government by the people.
The Constitution is an agreement between the people and the
government.  As long as the government obeys the Constitution, the
people will support it.  That's why the executive branch (at very
least) swears to uphold the Constitution.
It's up to the people to ensure that the government comply with the
Constitution.  It's not the government's job to enforce the
Constitution against itself, although, the Constitution is structured
so as to present the three branches of government with a zero-sum
game.  The plan is that the easiest way a branch can get more power is
to take it from another branch.  That way, the government gets
involved with fighting amongst itself for power rather than taking
more from the people.
You might enjoy Gene Sharp's three-book set entitled _The Politics of
Nonviolent Action_.  It goes into great depth on the source of
governmental power over people.

   Frankly, I agree.
  That's a [my] change from a few years ago, eh?
   The NSA will either adapt or die -- it seems to be trying to die right
   now rather than adapt, but thats not our problem.
Cautionary note here, Perry.  People who feel that have no choices
often don't care if the only choice they see is a bad one.  Hitler
[yeah, yeah, I know] convinced the German people that all their
choices were bad, but his was best.  They killed a few people -- it

@_subject: Security is not free 
I think that a lot of people have forgotten that security is not free.
Sometimes the cost is economic, sometimes it is mental.  Even using
encryption with GNU Emacs's mailcrypt package is not free, because it
takes time to verify that you're using signatures and encryption and
keys correctly.  And, without a certain amount of paranoia, you're
going to do something stupid.
I think the NSA is forgetting that security is not free.  They're
restricting American companies from exporting encryption.  Yes, this
increases America's security by some amount.  However, the cost of
doing this means that overseas encryption is going to overseas
companies, not US companies.  And this amounts to several billion
dollars per year.  I think we need to make sure that Congress knows it
is spending several billion dollars of someone else's money, in return
for the very small amount of security gained by keeping American
encryption products out of the worldwide market.

Because credentials are portable reputation.  A college is not a place

once you establish your own reputation (as I have in my field), a

   Sounds like an application for a "challenge-response" system. But that

   If there were syncnronized clocks then the signal could be a function of

From: Philippe Nave    Date: Thu, 28 Jul 94 09:03:00 MDT
   I think the single most important thing we could do for remailer operators
   would be to figure out how to make the remailers *truly* *anonymous*. That
   is, we need a net.hack of some sort that allows remailers to send their
   messages in a way that leaves no trace whatsoever of the original poster
   *and* leaves no trace of the remailer itself.
I don't think that's possible.  A host can always tell what other host
connected to it to deliver the mail.  That's a requirement of the TCP
However, what I think remailers *can* do is create a web of remailers
that's large enough that removal of any one site isn't going to affect
the web.  That pretty much means that the web needs to automatically
keep track of all the web members, and the software that creates the
chain of messages needs to query that list.

Now that's an interesting idea for contacting people anonymously.
Have a big mailing list where you know certain people are subscribed.
Everyone gets all the mail, but they put a filter on it so that only
mail directed to their anonym is delivered to them.  Or, if they're
really paranoid, they filter them by eye.
But it's so obvious that someone probably already thought of it...

Don't worry about online vs offline transactions.  The credit card
companies are moving toward all online transactions.  A company down
in NJ called RAM Mobile Data is helping them on this.  They have base
stations in 90% of urban business areas.  The radios are fairly cheap
(even though they need an appropriate thing to plug them into) and the
per-transaction charges are about a dime.
So I would say that the important problem to solve is "how do we make

   I plan to spend my lunch hour increasing the bandwidth of my network

Um, ah, er, I don't think you understand. It's the size of the *wire*,
not the size of the insulation, according to the elephant theory of
electronics.  You see, copper wires are not really solid.  They
actually have little tiny elephants running around in them.  Now, the
elephants go through straight lines pretty well.  But when they get to
a resistor, they have to slow down to get through the zig-zags.  And
they have to wait to jump across the two parallel lines of a
capacitor.  And when elephants on one side of a coil see the
elephants on the other side sliding down and having all the fun, they
want to join in and so slide down their side.
Electronics is really very simple.

Date: Mon, 2 May 1994 13:55:34 -0700
   From: Hal    Why don't we brainstorm a bit to see if we could come up with a way
   to take this digital cash software and do something useful and interesting
   with it.  It seems like too good an opportunity to just let it sit there and
   do nothing.  I know there has been some abstract discussion about cash
   systems in the past, but now we have something concrete and we should be
   to discuss it more specifically.
There have been several private-currancies in the recent past.  One of
them was written up in Utne Reader, quoting the Whole Earth Review.
I've got the information squirreled away somewhere.  That one was
interesting because it had a zero-sum money supply.  There was no
scrip -- all trades were registered with a central authority.  If I
traded a thing of value to you, my balance went up and yours went
down.  Debt was repudiatable only by leaving the system, and your
balance and trading rate was explicitly public information.  No one
could be forced to trade with anyone else, and trading with someone
(or not) based on their balance and trading rate was encouraged.
Inflation was not a problem because the money supply remained at zero.
The most telling remark from the originator (a Canadian) was that the
system worked best when you had someone with deep pockets who was
willing to run up a big positive balance by trading away things of
value for the private currancy.
So to get digital cash going, (IMHO) we need someone willing to risk a
bunch of bucks to get people in debt to the system.  Maybe someone
with some spare cash could print up a hundred Digital Cash T-shirts
(maybe a bit-mapped image of Johnny Cash? :) worth, say, $7, and sell
them for $10 bucks in digital cash.  The profit that would
(eventually, hopefully) bring would be their return on their risk.
There are other schemes that would work.

en $729, as the
   money makes it's way through the economy. Right.  Banks have to balance liquidity against uncertainty.
   So the money went around, and around, growing and growing, until
   it slowly became worthless.  The only thing that keeps money
   growth in check is market discipline and faith.  The whole house
   of cards doesn't come tumbling down, because Alice has faith that
   she has $1000.  In reality the emperor has no clothes.
In reality Alice's investment is nowhere near as liquid as she thought
it was.  Hers is only liquid if no one else's is.
   No, most major currencies are not on the Gold Standard.  They
   float purely in relation to other currencies.  So what gives
   money it's value?  Purely, the loans which back it up.  This is
   why it is practically impossible to stop, eco-disasters from
   continuing.  If the countries that have "borrowed" this money
   default, the whole thing collapses.  It collapses everywhere,
   simultaneously.
Well, no.  As long as banks can keep collecting and paying interest
and *some* of the principal, they're mostly okay.  They can rebuild
the lost principal through lower profits.  The place where the "faith"
comes in is the confidence investors have that their investment in the
bank is as liquid as they thought it was when they made it.
   Now we get to the problem with digital money. It's a stand alone
   system with no "faith" in it and with no growth built in.  Faith
   is the only thing that keeps things working, that and legislating
   paper as legal tender, so people are forced to accept it.
Not really, not at all.  I can start issuing my own wealth receipts
(digitally or not) as long as I can show people that I actually have
the wealth that I'm issuing the receipts for.  And yes, I'm subject to
keeping a reserve, otherwise how would people trust me?
   Obviously, legislating digital money as legal tender is outside
   our power.  Putting growth into the system without destroying
   faith is also very difficult.  The only logical step is to make
   digital money repesent something.  It must be convertable into
   something that people already have faith in.  Otherwise I fear,
   that digital money may not fly.
In the end, you have the right of it.  Digital cash must be
convertible to be accepted.

   If remailers offered robust (see above point about crufty, flaky, hobby

   attention to reliability, interconnectivity to other remailers, overall
   robustness, and carefully articulated policies about logging, privacy,

But there's a conflict here.  You'd like to be able to use the same
postage on multiple remailers.  But if the remailers know each other
well enough to agree on a common currency, then they know each other
well enough to remove the reason for using multiple remailers.

   I missed that session, opting to head for the airport before the rush.
   What exactly did Auerbach say? Sorry I missed the fun.
I missed it too, so I bought the tapes.  This is transcribed from the
tape of the Networld+Interop "The Clipper Chip Controversy" debate
between Baker of the NSA and Weitzman of the EFF.  Karl Auerbach was
the first questioner:
Auerbach: Okay, well, my name is Karl Auerbach, and first a
calibration tone.  I grew up reading the cases of Sacco and Vanzetti,
and Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, and I remember Kent State, and things
like that.  So, do I trust my government?  No.
Certain things.  First, a technical question.  You said that you sent
the chip off to the national labs for reverse engineering.  Did anyone
sent it to Taiwan?    Next thing.
Baker: Are these all going to be hypothetical?
A: Did you really try giving it to the experts?  I mean, is it really
reasonable to expect that someone isn't going to try to reverse
engineer this thing?
B: I think it's quite reasonable to buy devices with the chip in it
and sent it to whomever you'd like.  I don't necessarily believe that
I share your belief that you know who has the best technology for
doing this because the people at the national labs get to practice against
someone besides Intel and Motorola.    Just a response,
A: I'd like to see them have a try.  Anyway, getting more to the legal
matters, If I have a clipper phone, it's used by lots of people.  And,
does that increase the expectation of privacy which is recognized by
the supreme court and what happens to other people -- are we going to
enact parallel legislation that restricts the further use of just
ancillary conversations on the phone by a third party.  To make this
work, we're going to have to enact legislation that prohibits the use
of superencryption like pgp.  Are we going to do that?  And also
B: NO!
A: And also, are we going to allow PGP then?  And we're going to
superencrypt it.  So that means that your total system is dead.
B:  I have to ask myself, what is the value to you of
A: So you can't read it!
B: Yeah, that's right   Of course, but
A: If you want to do police work, get the police to find the key that
the pedophile used to encrypt his file.  Get your warrant to look for
that key.  He kept it somewhere.  It was just sloppy police work that
didn't get the key he's got somewhere .  And I
don't know what piece of information you had that led you to know that
that encrypted file had what you thought was in it.  Can you point,
can you specifically articulate reasons that would give you probably
cause to think that that information was in those files?  And I might
remind you, the Supreme Court requires that.  B: I'm trying to figure out which of your points to address first.
Let me start with the suggestion that superencryption somehow makes
this pointless.  I agree that if the government said that the only
kind of encryption you can use is clipper, that superencryption would
be a way of evading some kind of enforcement mechanism designed to
ensure that only clipper encryption was on the system.
A: So if I use PGP then you'll have probable cause to get a warrant?
B: No.  First, there's no suggestion, hasn't been a suggestion, you've
got denials left and right, that this is going to be a required
system.  If it's not a required system, what's the point of adding PGP
to clipper?  You can encrypt with PGP if you want to, and you get
whatever strength PGP gives you.  You add to that clipper and the
government has probably cause to decrypt your clipper conversations,
what you have is a single PGP-encrypted conversation, which is as good
as not having bothered going through the clipper encryption at all.
A: No, what I was expecting was that you're going to make the argument
that if we've got clipper, and we find that someone is using PGP in
addition to clipper, that therefore they've got something to hide, and
we'd better go after them.
B: Yeah, I think that's a paranoid suggestion.
A: Well, I'm paranoid, but the government...   And the
other thing is, we saw an earlier slide that says that this will only
be available to the federal government.  Now, if my statistics memory
is right, most criminals are investigated by state governments.  So is
this somehow, what's going to happen with the states?  Are they going
to have access to this, or are we going to create more magistrates?
Are we going to deputize all the local police as federal agents?
B: About 37 states have wiretap authority.  If they encounter
A: So the first slide lied.
B: I don't think so.
A: So those state police are now federal employees.  So this is more
than federal wiretapping, this is state wiretapping as well then?  And
I bet there's far more, how many state wiretaps are there per year?
B: I think the 900 includes that.  And the wiretapping proceeds in
this country pursuant to federal law.  It's regulated by federal law
even when it's done by state authorities.  That, probably, is the
answer to the other point you had suggested, which is that we need
some special law to protect third parties who might have conversations
with people.  In fact, there are already requirements on the books
that, after all, if you're conducting a wiretap, of John Gotti, you're
always going to get two people in those conversations.  There's not
much point in wiretapping him when he's not talking to somebody.
Consequently, if he calls somebody to order pizza, or if his daughter
orders pizza, or talks to her friends, there are already legal
requirements that you cease the recording of those conversations when
they're plainly not related to the crime.
A: And finally in respect to the escrows, since this is personally
identifiable information, I assume that under the privacy act, I have
access to it.
: Karl, it's not personally identifiable in the sense
that what the escrow agents maintain is a chip id and an encryption
key and there is not a mapping maintained in the system in general, at
any point, of who bought which device with chip id, so if that's what
you were referring to, I don't think it qualifies as you described it.
: Let me just add that unfortunately there's a law
enforcement exception to the privacy act, so I think it's an
interesting question whether it is personally identifiable or not, but
either way, there is an exception for on ongoing investigation.
   I heard somebody made a good crack to Baker about how he must have
   worked for the tobacco companies. Was that Auerbach?
No, that was the person who spoke after him.  It was "Mr. Baker, I
just have a very simple question about your position on all this.  Do
you ever feel like a cigarette industry executive?"  B: Let me turn that around a little, and I'll ask that about the EFF.
I wonder whether they don't ever feel like the NRA, because in fact,
 the analysis we hear of this issue, and the stuff,
you've all heard it, "they'll get my crypto key when they pry it from
my dead, cold fingers".  All that stuff is a deliberate invocation of
the same kind of analysis that gave us the gun policy that we have in
this country.  And so I guess if you like the gun policy that the NRA
gave us, I think you're going to love the privacy consequences of the
policies that the EFF is urging on us.
: Isn't that what the United States Constitution says, though?
B:  I don't think the constitution requires either of these

I wonder how well a zero-balance money supply would work (having
positive and negative money)?  Positive and negative money is created
simultaneously by a single transfer of wealth.  The only problem I see
is the possibility of reneging on negative money.  Of course, when
that happens nowadays, we call it bankruptcy.  So I guess we deal one
way or another.  The banking system would have to constantly take a
percentage of all transfers to pay its costs, one of which is
I *think* it would be impossible to inflate or deflate such a currency.
Inflation might occur if people lost faith in it, but it would also
have a negative feedback effect.  Inflation increases people's ability
to pay off their negative money, which puts a cap on the amount of
inflation that could occur.  As soon as the money inflated a little,
people who could pay off their negative balances would do so at the
newly inflated value.
I also think it would be impossible to run such a currency
anonymously, because a negative balance is essentially a loan, and how
could you loan money to someone who could be anyone?  Only if they had
established a reputation with their public key...
Hmmm...  Interesting, then.  You could only effectively work
anonymously if you had created a reputation for your anonym.  And that
reputation would have to be established in some way *before* anyone
would loan you money, otherwise such a loan would end up being a gift.
One way to establish such a reputation would be to write some free
software, or answer Usenet questions, or were otherwise seen to be
knowledgable and responsible.  I haven't seen anyone try it yet,
though.  Does anyone know of such an attempt?

   called LETS, which works on this principle.
Yes, I'm sorry, I should have mentioned LETS by way of crediting them.
   One of the interesting features of such an alternative economy,
   especially when when it operates side-by-side with a traditional one
   where debtors could leave the system, is that there is a strong
   community incentive to prevent anyone building up either too large a
   debt or too great wealth. In both cases such a person becomes a risk
   and a burden. But there is never any problem of someone keeping money
   out of circulation, or being short of small change.
I think that it's more a matter of trust.  If you trust the system to
work well, you can carry a high positive balance (e.g. selling a house
to someone).
   In the LETS system I mentioned above, everyone's current balance and
   trading volume were published in a newsletter. That way, community
   members were encouraged to keep their balances, and those of their
   trading partners, near zero.
Right.  It encourages you to keep your wealth as wealth, and not
wealth receipts.  But then again, inflation encourages that also.  :)

   This is the same situation as now. However, consider that you don't
   actually *need* anyone to lend you money -- you can make as much as
   you like yourself by contributing to the community, or borrow some
   from the community at any time.
Hmmm, hadn't thought of that (tho it's obvious now that I do).  Yes,
it's community-based, trust-based borrowing.  But also hmmm, it lets
individuals make borrowing decisions for the corporate body.  Not
necessarily such a good thing.

   Organization: University of Technology, Sydney.
   As the RSA patent is expected to expire in the coming years, one would
   expect the liberation of PGP, at least in terms of the RSA algorithm
   (negating the export control issues). The sinister fact of PGP 2.6, and
   other derived RSAREF product is that even as the patent itself expires,
   RSADSI still exerts control over PGP by way of RSAREF.
You have to assume that RSA isn't being run by idiots.  Either they're
looking at closing their doors in seven years, or they've got a plan.
If it were *my* company, I'd make sure that everyone depends on
running my software.  And since that's what I'd do, it's only
reasonable to assume that that's what RSA is trying to do.
So maybe what we (the c'punk community) need to do is maintain
parallel versions of PGP (ick), one which continues to use 100% GPL'ed
code, and another which uses RSAREF to stay legal.

       Even the religiously inclined don't advocate turning the other
       cheek ad inifinitum...
Oh?  Methinks you don't know the context of what Jesus said.  At that
time, only citizens hit each other with their fists.  Slaves were hit
with the back of the hand.  The penalty for hitting someone with a
fist was much greater than backhanding them.  In a predominantly
right-handed society, slaves got backhanded on the right cheek.  Now
how do you backhand someone after they've turned the other cheek?  You
can't -- you can only strike them like a citizen.
And in the same context, Jesus told his followers to carry a soldier's
pack for two miles if they were asked to carry it for one.  The Roman
soldiers were allowed to impress citizens to carry their packs for no
more than a mile.  Any more and they were fined.  So Jesus was telling
his followers to cause trouble for soldiers by making them beg for
their packs back.
And in the same context, poor people had no collateral to borrow money
except the clothes on their back, that is, inner and outer robes.  A
person could borrow against the value of their outer robes.  And of
course, if they didn't pay back their debt, they had their outer robe
taken from them.  Now, the outer robe was necessary to keep from
freezing at night, so this was a problem!  So Jesus told his followers
that, when someone sued them for their outer robe, to give them their
inner robe as well.  At the time, nudity was shameful to the *viewer*,
so this caused great consternation.
Jesus didn't expect his followers to suffer fools gladly, but neither
did he ask them to use violence against them.

Can't answer all of your questions, but I'll answer the ones I can,
which will save time for someone else to answer the rest of them.
   Apart from thwarting traffic analysis attacks, how does the security
   of a Mixmaster Type II remailer packet compare to that of a
   PGP-chained Type I message?
Well, on the one hand, PGP uses IDEA, which is arguably better than
triple-DES, but PGP also only uses the key length(s) of choice, which
is to say that if you use the minimum length, you have very little
security.  Also, Mixmaster packets remain the same length from hop to
hop, so they are harder to track.
Not every PGP remailer reorders.
   For example, is each remailer in the path limited to knowing only
   the next remailer in the path?
And the previous one.  For PGP-chaining, that tells you a lot, because
you can observe the message length getting smaller.
   Is there any way for a remailer (except for the first and last in
   the chain) to know how many hops have already occurred or how many
   remain?
No.  The hop list is a constant length, and the list is back-encrypted
through the chain, so that all you can ever know is the next hop,
which the previous remailer couldn't know because it couldn't decrypt
And not even the first or last necessarily!  Both the source and
destination are running Mixmaster (by definition).  There's no reason
why mixmaster must remail -- eventually it delivers.  And someone
sourced the mail using Mixmaster.  If the source or destination is not
on an advertised remailer, or the destination was non-local to the
destination remailerthen it's pretty obvious that someone on that host
is an endpoint.  But that's one of the beauties of Mixmaster --
there's a large security increase in setting it up as a remailer and
advertising it.
   Would any security be lost if Type I and II technology were combined
   and a PGP-chained Type I packet were initially sent via Mixmaster?
Security is increased.
   Is my math correct in surmising that chaining a message through five
   remailers, each with a reordering pool of five messages, could mean
   that the message eventually leaves the chain as one of 5^5 (3125)
   possible messages?
You're ignoring the case where it is to/from a machine that runs a
public remailer.

   The problem with a _free_ remailer is obvious -- like many
   other Internet resources, it can suffer from the tragedy of
   the commons.    Even a negligible fee would do much to prevent gross remailer
   abuse. It may not be feasible to make remailers in to an
   industry, but this isn't the point -- it will keep the utterly
   lame from using it for pranks and their ilk.
Use First Virtual.  The "information" that you sell is a one-time
email alias that points to your remailer.  After an hour, that email
alias gets disabled.  This dynamic setup is easy to do with smail,
just a matter of dropping a file into a directory.
And who cares if they pay you or not, because if they don't pay
(choose to purchase the information), eventually FV will cancel their
Send mail to info at fv.com.  This gets you an automated response.
Their contract says that they won't enforce payment on services, so if
you offer a service, you're completely at risk, but again, there's not
much real risk here...

   Heh. An anonymous remailer paid for by credit card... there'd

Shareware is essentially begging, yes.  Far better to just give the

Selling services is profitable, particularly if you can sell the same

It seems like it solves two separate problems: 1) foiling traffic

separate, really, because if you really, really trust the remailer (as

If you trust any one remailer, then you needn't bother using any other
ones (assuming that remailer has enough traffic, delay, mixing, etc to
foil traffic analysis).  There's no real difference between using a
set (N>1) of trusted remailers and using only one, because you can
consider the set of remailers to be a single remailer from the point
of view of traffic analysis.
But to be sure, at least one of your remailers MUST attempt to foil
traffic analysis, otherwise you're effectively mistrusting the
remailer operators but trusting the NSA (or FBI).  As I said a month

If you want to access the Internet in a way that doesn't reveal your

Internet access via radios.  A small part-15 (900Mhz) $500 radio modem
is needed, plus a few dozen bucks/month (thereabouts).  If you use a
yagi antenna, that will reduce your emissions to mostly one direction.
If you're in line-of-sight with one of their poletops, you can point a
telescope in that direction, and transmit only when you *don't* see a
truck bristling with antennas.  Every radio has a serial number, and
they record who's got what, so they could cut you off much, much
easier than catching you.
For more information, see .
Same thing can be done with radiomail, but the speed is slower and the
radios and service are more expensive.  And, they can still cut you off.
Of course, part-time connectivity is problemmatic, because you need to
receive mail at all times.  Of course, you could use a mail hub in a

The threat is no doubt overblown, but it's not all foolishness.  My NY
State Senator is proposing to make a felony out of initiating contact
with a minor for sexual purposes.  It's illegal now, but it's only a
misdemeanor.  I spoke to Bob Penna, the legislative aide who
researched and wrote up the bill for Bill Sears.  He realizes that the
Internet cannot reasonably be censored, and that the solution is to be
able to punish people who do it (hence the felony) and to educate
parents and teachers to supervise children's online dealings (hence
the travelling road show to do just that).
No mention of "watch out if your child starts using encryption
programs" as a sign of online abuse.  Bob Penna admitted to having no
online access, so I'm sure he knows nothing about encryption.

   Well, in reality you still can catch them,  after all no one can sexually
   assault anyone over the internet (yet, anyway).
Mmmm, being the parent of two children, I have to disagree.  The brain
is the primary sexual organ, after all.
   Sometime they've got to do something in person, and there's no
   encryption in a physical meeting, where everyone sees your
   TrueFace.  But I'm not sure how much I trust the gubmint types to
   take this all into account, instead of just abolishing crypto on

Hey, I don't trust the gubmint either, that's why I called Bob to get
an explanation.  I really *don't* think that New York State plans to
ban encryption, not now and not over this issue anyway.  His thrust is
1) to have the legal authority to sufficiently punish someone who goes
after children (which they don't have now), and 2) to educate guardians
about the risks of untoward communications from adults to children.

There *will* always be a free version of the client with source code,

   market for Mixmaster, could there be other motives?
Value is created by seeing a market that no one else sees.  Obvious
markets have low margins, and they're getting lower and lower as
computers help implement the obvious.
   Without building an anonymous e-$ infrastructure first, there's no
   way to even charge for the use of a remailing service without
   sacrificing anonymity, even if people were willing to pay to have
   messages anonymously remailed.
Maybe someone *does* see a way to create system?  If *you* knew,
would you tell everyone about it?  Or would you implement it, and rake
in the bucks?
   No, I'm not accusing Lance.  But if he no longer has the time to
   support Mixmaster, then perhaps some other crypto-friendly group
   should take over the task and keep it an OPEN system, with source
   code available.  In fact, even freezing Mixmaster as is would be
   preferable to "improvements" that people don't/can't trust.
Since you have no reputation to impugn, I feel free to be rude: "Put
up or shut up."  If you have the resources to improve Mixmaster so
that it's easy to use, do it.  If not, please don't stand in the way
of people who *do* have the resources.

Doh!  So set up a business which certifies PGP signatures.  What you
do is take money from people in exchange for a sheet of paper which
contains the PGP fingerprint, and a notarized copy of the person's
driver's license, credit card, or whatever.  Once you get that piece
of paper, you sign the person's PGP key with your business's key.
You certify that you have the piece of paper on file, and will provide
it upon payment of some small fee.
There.  A signature registry.  And you can even do it through a
service like First Virtual, or Digicash or Cybercash.  The only reason
I haven't done it is because I have other business with a higher
margin, and there's only so much Russell to go around.

Scott indicates, in private mail, that he needs another, clearer,
explanation.  Okay, here goes:
A is sender, B is recipient, M is mixmaster remailer network, W is
A Mixmaster system (there can be more than one, although there is
currently only one published Mixmaster system of remailers) acts as a
single node for the purposes of traffic analysis.  Imagine, if you
will, a remailer that everyone trusts implicitly.  Why would you need
any other remailers??  All W can see is incoming mixmaster messages
(lets you identify A), and outgoing ASCII messages (lets you identify
B).  If W can correlate traffic between A and B, he does it by
watching what happens between A and B, not being privy to the
internals of M.
Now obviously there is no single trustable M.  So, you create many Ms,
who move traffic between themselves.  Let's assume that only one of
them is trustable (M') and happens to be used by A to send a message
to B.  W STILL doesn't know what happens inside M' and has no more
information about the correlation between the message sent by A and
the message received by B than in the first case.
Do you see now, Scott?  Adding mixmasters doesn't need to make traffic
analysis harder (it does, but it doesn't need to).  It makes finding
an M that you trust easier.  And to that end, it doesn't matter if
those mixmasters are all running on the same host or not.
Now, my point about increased security by sender and/or receiver
running a Mixmaster remailer is that W has an easy time identifying A
and B because he can see that A sends a mixmaster message, and B
receives an ASCII message from a mixmaster remailer.  If either A or B
is running a mixmaster, W is denied knowledge that A or B even exists.
He MUST assume that anyone running a remailer is receiving or sending
some or all of the messages.  Message counting (looking for a delta
implying an internally received or transmitted message) is no help.
Since mixmaster happily ignores bogus messages, I could receive a
message, fill its packets with junk, send them one or more hops, and
let someone *else* be under suspicion of having received a message.
As an aside, the TLAs *are* looking for A's and B's.  They spend
millions of dollars a year on telephone traffic analysis.  We MUST
assume that they would spend tens of thousands of dollars a year on
email traffic analysis.

@_subject: Multiple Remailers at a site? 
Sorry to be following up to my own message Yet Again, but I see a hole
in my analysis that needs patching.
If you have a mixmaster host M, with certain characteristics (latency,
reordering, and traffic volume), that is NOT identical in security to
a mixmaster network M with identical characteristics, but in which
some hosts are not trustable.  The non-trustable host(s) keep track of
their latency, reordering, and traffic volume, so it's removed from
the characteristics of the network above.
Therefore, to keep the characteristics of the trusted host constant
when converting into a partially trusted network, each of the
individual hosts needs to increase their parameters by some amount
(which amount someone else will have to contribute, cuz I have no clue
and need sleep).

Sure *does* matter.  There's no computationally feasible way to
associate one mixmaster message with another.  The only way you can
get a clue is by analyzing who sends mail into and out of the
mixmaster system.  If both of your endpoints are within the mixmaster
system, you have no entering or exiting mail to analyze.  It doesn't
matter if the mixmaster remailers are on the same or different systems.

Ahhhh, sleep is a wonderful thing.  It clears the brain so well.  The
increase is proportional to the level of distrust of the individual
hosts by other hosts.  If you think half the hosts are TLS moles,
you'd double your characteristics (reordering and traffic).

I never said or even (should you be a telepath) thought that he

No, I was responding to the person who was distrustful of the law's

Makes it much harder for them to claim that PGP won't work because
there's no central signature registry.  PGP doesn't require a central
registry, but then again it doesn't disallow it either.

1) New .edu registrations are restricted to colleges, but you have

2) .k12.STATE.us is safe enough to restrict, except that some people
   are staff members who will be unhappy.  Of course, those people can
   just change their DNS so it responds to a PTR request with
   a.root-servers.net.  So naturally you don't let the students manage
   your servers (although frankly, the staff members have little time
   or knowledge to do it themselve; most would be happy to find a
   trustworthy student).  Even so, said smart student will discover
   that it's possible to spoof the DNS by spamming a client with
   responses.  That's particularly easy since the source of the packet
   will likely be the same subnet that the smart student.
You can't use the DNS for authentication of any type, particularly if
a Damoclean CDA is hanging over your head.

Yup.  Clearly, then you will wish to start your own mailing list,
which you will promise is not property, not censorable, and not
terminable without notice.  Do it!  Don't let us tell you you can't

@_subject: A Brief History of Cryptography 
[ I'm not on the list.  Replies cc'ed to me.  Public domain ]
Once upon a time, the average citizen did not have access to locks.
The U.S. Government had locks, and agencies to control them: the FBL,
the CLA, and the NLA.  They even knew that other governments had
locks, but they also knew that those governments denied locks to their
citizens, so the whole lock business was cartelized.
However, the need for locks could not be denied, so the NLA was
chartered to create locks for U.S. citizens.  It created a lock, but
didn't explain how the lock worked.  Some people showed that the lock
might be pickable by the NLA, although they couldn't pick it
themselves.  Some people thought that the extra wards in the lock were
there to give the NLA a master key.  But none of it could be proved,
so people used the standard lock.
As the society got wealthier, people had more things they needed to
lock up.  This created more incentive for lock creation, and citizens
started to invent them.  Some locks were sham locks and could be
picked with a hairpin, or a skeleton key.  Other locks were
understandably difficult to pick, and came to be preferred to the
NLA-approved standard lock.
The NLA (and FBL and CLA) feared these locks that they hadn't devised
and probably couldn't pick.  So they proposed a scheme whereby they
would create a new standard lock, which had an explicit master key.
Naturally, this was viewed as a step backwards by people used to the
standard lock, which they believed couldn't be opened by anyone but
the key-holder.  This lock design was opposed by nearly everyone.
So they proposed a new lock standard, whereby everyone had to have a
copy of their key registered with the NLA.  This also was perceived as
unworkable for the same reason as the master key system.
In the meantime, of course, people were using these new
citizen-created locks, which were widely thought to be strong.  They
expected no less of the NLA lock design, particularly since the NLA
standard lock has been proven to be pickable.
How will this story end?  No one knows yet.  Will the NLA seek to ban
strong locks?  Or will the NLA lose all its control over citizen
locking?  Time will tell....

We have, of course, no way to verify this fact, since your messages
are not cryptographically signed.  For someone who claims to be

I agree that it's irrelevant.  So why is he trying to argue from
authority (always a fallacy anyway) without *even* having any way to
prove that he is that authority?  Fine, let him desire plausible
deniability.  I plausibly deny his appeal to (self-)authority as being
completely without merit.

Can't be done.  I don't have time to go into ALL the reasons.
Fortunately for me, any one reason is sufficient.   it's all about
the economics.  You have failed to specify that the cost of breaking
into the data has to exceed the value of the data.  But even if you
did that, you'd have to assume that the data was never worth more than
that to *anyone*.  As soon as it was worth that, they could break into
the data, and data is, after all, just data.
Ignore economics at your peril.

You're wearing your programmer's hat when you say that.  But the
problem isn't programming, but is instead economic.  Switch hats.  The
changes that you list above may or may not offer some security
advantages.  Who cares?  What really matters is whether they increase
the cost of copying.  I say that the answer is no, for a very simple
reason: breaking into your own computer is a "victimless" crime.
In a crime there are at least two parties: the victim and the
perpetrator.  What makes the so-called victimless crime unique is that
the victim is not present for the perpetration of the crime.  In such
a crime, all of the perpetrators have reason to keep silent about the
comission of the crime.  So it will be with people breaking into their
own TCPA-protected computer and application.  Nobody with evidence of
the crime is interested in reporting the crime, nor in stopping
further crimes.
Yes, the TCPA hardware introduces difficulties.  If there is way
around them in software, then someone need only write it once.  The
whole TCPA house of cards relies on no card ever falling down.  Once
it falls down, people have unrestricted access to content.  And that
means that we go back to today's game, where the contents of CDs are
open and available for modification.  Someone could distribute a pile
of "random" bits, which, when xored with the encrypted copy, becomes
an unencrypted copy.

Huh?  Somebody is confused here.  DomainKeys is 1) an e-mail
authentication system, and 2) it doesn't check IP addresses.  Instead,
it uses cryptographic signing using public/private keys which have the
potential of being assigned down to the individual level.

Yes, this is true.  John Gilmore is a pain in the ass for standing on
his rights (some government types might say *fucking* pain in the
ass), but he is correct.  ALL of the effort spent to secure open
relays was basically wasted effort, because spammers just moved on to
insecure client machines.  The proper route to control spam is to
involve users in prioritizing their email, so that their friend's
email comes first, followed by anybody they've sent mail to, followed
by people they've gotten email from before, followed by mailing list
mail, followed by email from strangers (which is where all the spam
is).  All of that relies on email authentication to work.
Why the heck can't we just shortcut all this pain, and just listen to
John in the first place?  I vote to elect John to the post of
Benevolent Dictator For Life.

Anybody can pay to send email right now.  You just go to paypal, type
in the person's email, enter the amount of money you think is
necessary to persuade them to read the email, and put the text of your
message in the comment box.  My email is paypal.com at russnelson.com;
feel free to send me as much email as you want, ca-ching!
But anyway, that's not what I propose.  I suggest that email from
strangers needs to come with an introducer of some sort to convince
you to read it.  There's a dozen different kind of introducers which
could be used, some of them using cryptography, only one or two of
which involve payment.  The days when all email was treated equally by
an email client are long past, or at least, should be if you're
running a decent email client.  Maybe the level of spam complaints is
caused by the low quality of email clients?

This is why we need a national identification card.
It's also why we don't need a national identification card.
The same evidence leads to two different conclusions depending on what

@_subject: [IP] Re:       Madness: Bailing Out Greed in Wonderland 
Huh?  Do you mean the free-ish market in China or the socialist
nationalization of banks and insurance companies in the US?
There is a lot of ruin in a nation.  Here is the $20 Austrian
economist's version of what has happened, and what will happen:
When I say "only", "all" and "no", I am exaggerating for the sake of
understanding.  It's easier to understand how things work when you
take them to their limits.
Free markets respond to their version of planning: prices.  For this
to work, prices need to be accurate.  The supply of money needs to be
constant (no, Mr. Bernanke, not inflating at whatever you guess to be
the growth of the economy; constant).  Government needs to not frick
with things.  No policy-based taxation, quotas or tariffs.  No minimum
or maximum prices.  No bailouts of companies "too big to fail."  No
rules against monopolization.
If these rules are observed, then companies that make their customers
happy will succeed, and those that do not will fail.  When no company
makes their customers happy, customers will not spend money.  They
will save their money, instead.  This will drive down the cost of
money.  Companies will have more money available to them to create new
products that make customers happy.  Alternatively, when all companies
are making their customers happy, the cost of money will go up, and
only those customers making their customers happiest will be able to
afford new investment.
What happens when those rules are broken?  First, if you create new
money which has no value to buy with it, you have made the cost of
money go down temporarily.  This leads companies to invest in new
products, which they expect customers to be willing to buy with the
money they've saved ... only this new money didn't come from saving.
It was created from nothing.  It was a lie.
What has happened in the U.S. is that the Fed created new money
starting in 1997.  This led to the dot-com boom.  People spent money
to create businesses they thought would be huge hits.  They thought
there was lots of new money to build businesses and later buy the
products.  There wasn't.  Same thing in 2003.  It was very cheap to
borrow money and build houses.  The homebuilders did very well.
Unfortunately, they were building them for people who hadn't really
saved, and couldn't really afford them.
Every time the central bank creates a boom, it MUST be followed by a
bust.  The boom creates incorrect investments, and the bust consists
of revaluing those investments to their new, lower value.  Companies
go bankrupt and their assets are sold off.  Homeowners cannot pay
their mortgage and lose their house (which isn't such a bad deal for
them since they had no money down, were renters before and will be
renters again).
Government bail-outs interrupt this process by stopping the revaluing.
Only when the assets have been revalued, and sold off, will the
economy recover as those assets are applied to new productive
purposes.  Prices are information and communication; interfering with
them by applying arbitrary value is just another form of government
censorship.  It destroys market planning and substitutes central
government planning (and we all know how well THAT works).
Where did the Fed get the money from to do these failouts?  By
printing up new money.  This is EXACTLY the wrong thing to do.  It
will send the wrong signal to companies and individuals.  It will be
that much longer before assets get repriced.
Banning shorting of financial stocks is more censorship.  If you have
money, and think a stock is going to go down, and you short a stock,
you borrow somebody's stock and sell it.  That drives the price down,
which reduces other people's interest in shorting the stock.  It also
brings tomorrow's price into the present.  If you're wrong in your
guess, and the stock price goes up, you lose your money and cannot
make these bets again.  If you're right, and the stock goes down
further, you have done the market a service and you get rewarded for
Prices are speech.
