@_subject: no ftpd on soda.berkeley.edu ? 
Has anyone else tried to ftp soda in the past 2 days or so?  I've been
unable to establish a connection.  I assume whoever maintains the
Cypherpunks archive on this machine (is it Eric H.?) might be able to
find out:  Is there any ftpd running on it at the moment, and what's the
expected downtime?
