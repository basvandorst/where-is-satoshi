@_subject: THE JEWS (ALL of them!) Try to kick Ernst Zundel off Usenet!! 
Excerpts from request: 4-Feb-96 Re: THE JEWS (ALL of them!).. by
ErnstZundl at aol.com The ernstzundl at aol.com imposter obviously does not know that Xenu will
chain him to an Antarctic volcano and annihilate him with nuclear
weapons. Beware the thetans!
ObCrypto: Obviously someone as controversial as Zundel needs to PGP-sign
his messages. (Actually, *her* messages, since Ingrid posts for the
Zundelish One.) Does anyone want to show her how to use PGP? I think she
has a PPP connection from her computer at home to cts.com. Message
headers don't indicate what mailer she uses.
