@_subject: Free Visa Card and Great Referral Bonuses 
Hi  ,
Take a quick look at Visa Card Rebates. They're giving away free Visa cards with free flight miles on any airline and paying MLM commissions to refer other Cardholders. They pay out on a huge 10-level plan ($10 for the first level and $2 on the next nine). You already know how many millions of dollars that kind of multiplication can generate. Nobody buys a thing. The money comes from the bank because of the value of cardholders. This thing is spreading like wildfire. Please check it out at This is a one time mailing.  You will not receive any further offers.
