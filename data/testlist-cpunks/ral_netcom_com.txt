@_subject: PGP & ELM 
Would someone be able to send me the most recent verions of the utils to
use PGP with ELM?  Just got a new account and finally have ELM.  If you
can, mail 'em or anon ftp to netcom.com and put them in pub/ral/incoming.
While i'm at it, has anyone ever tried to integrate PGP into VMS MAIL?
Thanks,  bob

@_subject: PGP Perl scripts for Elm 
I have been trying to use the pgp perl scripts for elm, and i must be
doing something very wrong.  Perhaps someone here can help.  I did edit
the scripts to include the location of perl on this machine, and have
specified the scripts as my pager and editor.  This is what happens when i
try them:
Command: Mail                           To: ral (Robert A. Luscombe)
Invoking editor.../u43/ral/.bin/pgpedit: =: not found
And when i try to view something:
So, what did i do wrong (or didn't do)?
