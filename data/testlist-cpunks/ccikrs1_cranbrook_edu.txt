@_subject: Wikipedia project: Crypto 
The good people at Wikipedia have started a cryptography subproject, "an
attempt to build a comprehensive and detailed guide to cryptography in
the Wikipedia." The project page:
features a list of open tasks and things that need cleanup or writing
about. For anyone who has a few minutes to spare, their contributions
would without a doubt be most appreciated.
