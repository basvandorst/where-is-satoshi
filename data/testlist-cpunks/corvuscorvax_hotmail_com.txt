NYT this morning reports the that the Digital Millenium Copyright Act was adopted by the Senate Judiciary Committee:
"WASHINGTON - The Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday adopted the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which takes a new step toward protecting creative content in cyberspace by outlawing the equipment used to commit a copyright infringement, not just the act or intent of illegally copying material. Most visibly absent was any exemption for devices used in encryption
research, an issue Senate leaders said they hope to work out before the bill goes to the floor. "
There's been a good deal of discussion of this issue around here, to be sure. But I think maybe it bears repeating that even with some kind of narrow exemption for "encryption research", this bill is conveniently poised to be used not only against Evil Copyright Infringers, but also against the kind of troublemakers that expose, for instance, the deliberate weakening of GSM authentication.
Gawd. What bullshit.

I was recently asked to produce a drivers license in order to exchange a pair of long johns, paid for in cash. I asked why. "Store policy" was the reply. I asked why it was store policy, and the cashier responded with a hostile stare and exchanged the underwear for me.
Along the same lines, try refusing to give your zip code when asked at a register. Evidently some stores now simply cannot process a transaction without it. It's good for a laugh if you're bored. Borged?
