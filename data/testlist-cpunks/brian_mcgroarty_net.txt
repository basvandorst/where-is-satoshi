Suppose individual ballots weren't usable to verify a vote, but
instead confirming data was distributed across 2-3 future ballot
receipts such that all of them were needed to reconstruct another
ballot's vote.
It would then be possible to verify an election with reasonable
confidence if a large number of ballot receipts were collected, but
individual ballot receipts would be worthless.
