As for libel, its damn hard to make stick- public figures have a hight standard, which includes proving actual malice. Fun

In a message dated 6/9/01 11:53:11 PM Eastern Daylight Time, Right, reading it literally. But the supreme court has interpreted the "due process" clause to include rights granted under the bill of rights (using the incorperation doctrine). I know it isn't in the 14th itself, but the way the court has interpreted it has given it this meaning. Look at New York v. Griswold (i think) for a good example of this. The court applied unreasonable search and siezure to a state using the 14th. The same goes for free speech.

In a message dated 6/10/01 12:33:58 AM Eastern Daylight Time, Sorry, poor choice of language on my part. True, the bill of rights doesn't actually *assign* rights- it prohibits the federal government from making any laws that restrict them. Reading from amendments 1-10, and the othe articles of the Constitution, the Bill of Rights doesn't apply to the states- and this was legal fact until the passage of the 14th amendment. But that 14th stated that (paraphrasing here) "no state may deny a citizen due process of law". The Supreme Court interpreted this (in effect, adding foot notes to the constitution) to mean that the Bill of Rights now applied to the states. I know that nowhere in the Constitution does it say that "states must honour the bill of rights". But look in Supreme Court decisions (which, legally, are pretty much an extension of the constitution). There, it is *clearly* stated that the Bill of Right's restrictions of the federal government's powers applies to the states as well. So when you say that the Constitution only says that states laws must be representative, you are ignoring the 14th amendment, and what it does to the relationthip between state governments and their citizens. But yeah, that's all I'm trying to say. Enough is enough.

The problem with the due "Process Clause" is it injects a false distinction
with respect to 'types' of rights. See the first two sentences of the DoI
for a clarification of the only operable definition of 'right' acceptable in
I'm going to have to admit that I've pretty much lost the thread of the argument here- I'm just trying to point out that under the incorperation doctrine, the 14th amendment has been used to expand the bill of rights to apply to the states. No, the constitution doesn't explicitly state this. But the supreme court says that it is part of the constitution, which pretty much makes it so (yes, there are some important legal distinctions between court opinions and the Constitution itself, but for the most part, they function as the same thing, with the opinions footnoting the Constitution).
