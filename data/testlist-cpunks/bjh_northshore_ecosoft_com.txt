ATRB is inspired by the as-yet-unimplemented hardware strategy that
    appears in PGP v2.3a. ATRB does not suggest a standard usage (API),
    but rather demonstrates a hardware-specific method for capturing
    keyboard latency intervals.
    This method requires an AT (all) or XT (some) BIOS that supports
    interrupt 15h, func 4Fh, keyboard intercept.  Note that this
    implementation traps key _releases_, not presses. This avoids
    needless problems and complexity.
    MS-DOS extentions are not standardized amongst C compilers, however,
    it should be relativly easy to adapt this Turbo C implementation for
    other compilers.
    Finally, a note concerning the MD5 Message-Digest...
    Ron Rivest, in Request for Comments 1321, says:
    "The MD5 algorithm has been carefully scrutinized for weaknesses. It
    is, however, a relatively new algorithm and further security analysis
    is of course justified, as is the case with any new proposal of this
    sort."
    With respect to this statement, I am concerned about the non-standard
    usage of the MD5 in PGP's randstir() function. (I'm not an expert, nor
    do I pretend to be.)
    Please direct questions, comments and job offers to the above address.

@_subject: The dumbest question... 
... is the one you don't ask. So here I go...
Isn't "part of the deal" of patent granting a requirement that the details of the thing being patented be revealed. If so, why isn't IBM required to reveal the details of s-box design? After all, they hold the patent on DES.
Skipjack has a 80 bit key which is proposed to be "escrowed" in two parts.
Now considering that the likeliest attack on DES is a brute force key search of 2^55 keys, isn't it true that a compromise of one half of a "Clipper key" would allow a brute force attack to "discover the remaining 40 bits. If 2^55 is possible, then 2^40 is even easier, no?
