@_subject: a little problem... 
here goes: i'm tring to put on our campus (my university) one machine to
make the gateway betwen radio amat. and the internet.. at the begining it
may be only e-mail, and web.
  I'm thinking in using a linux on a pentium, conected with one or two
baycom modem conected to the radio, and running a tcp packet radio
network. In the machine, i put squid, or other proxie server for web, a
pop mail and a connection to our moo (atlantis.fe.up.pt 7777).
  first problem: how to make the autentication ? every one in the the
packet radio network gets all packets... i was thinking in using secure
shell, but i only get one machine, and if i get, say, 15 users, i don't
get the cpu power to manage all that stuff.
  second problem: i want to gerate free acounts/free e-mails automatic for
the radio ham. where can i get all this software? BTW, i'm in europe,
portugal. anyone have any electronic hardware (not expensive), to speed up
the autentication (without fancy chips that nobody have ..) ?
   please reply to me with your sugestions, flames, etc
