hi guys,

the mails talk about "sandy (god knows who he is) and he censoring
mails" rather than crypto stuff.

censoring issue.

hi guys,
i am a bit confused. what exactly are the us govt crypto regulations.
what i mean is that :
1) is it illegal to develop an encryption tool (s/w) in the US which
uses > 40 bit size session keys and then export that s/w outside of the
2) is it illegal to encrypt some data inside the us with a key > 40 bit
in size and then send that data outside the US.

SecureFile is not using the Win 95 password for encrypting the files.
Win 95 or Win NT never hands over the password to any application.
CAPI 2.0 is so nicely integrated with the OS that unless you have logged
in you wont get access to you keys. Now SecureFile is CAPI 2.0 based
application, so to use SecureFile you have to log in. Once this is done
the crypto operations (encryption/signing) etc are performed using your
The advantage you gain is that, a separate SecureFile logon is not
required and nobody but you will be able to access your keys as they are
protected by the OS.
The SecureFile setup ensures that on Win 95 you have actually logged in
and that you are working in the "Multiple Profiles" mode.
Thank you for your interest in SecureFile. Please feel free to ask any
questions you may have.

I am sorry I dont understand you question.
Your Windows password is not used to actually any data. The Windows
login just lets you access your keys. This way even if you change your
Windows password it will not affect yout CAPI installation. As long as
the OS identifies you it lets you access your keys.
Yes! you are right. Security without a good policy is an open door.
This can be configured by the administrator of the domain.
Thank you for your interest in SecureFile. Please feel free to ask any
