@_subject: Firefox through Tor 
I'm happy to announce a new Firefox extension which is built with Tor in mind
from the ground up.
FoxyProxy - I took the things I liked about SwitchProxy, TorButton, ProxyButton,
QuickButton, xyzproxy, etc. and added a number of crucial features:
* Tor Wizard - now zero configuration to use Firefox with Tor
* Define proxy use based on URL patterns using wildcards and/or regular
expressions: now you can route *.onion domains and web mail accounts (gmail,
yahoo, etc) through Tor but not CNN and Slashdot, for example, without having
to constantly change Firefox's proxy settings.
* Define multiple proxies
* No more wondering whether or not a URL loaded through a proxy: FoxyProxy
includes a complete log of all URLs loaded, including which proxy was used,
which pattern was matched, timestamps, etc.
* Temporarily or permanently dedicate all URLs to go through a particular
* Temporarily or permanently disable use of a proxy
* FoxyProxy hooks directly into Firefox via XPCOM--this yields much greater
performance than the de facto standard of updating about:config preferences
programmatically (used by every other proxy extensions I could find)
* Lots more
I hope you enjoy it. I look forward to your comments.

Not apparently. I sent one of these links earlier in this thread IIRC.
These papers are by Peter Gutman himself.
"7. Methods of Recovery for Data stored in Random-Access Memory"
"8. Erasure of Data stored in Random-Access Memory"
Data Remanence in Semiconductor Devices -- all 19 pages
It's been a few years since I've read these articles personally.
