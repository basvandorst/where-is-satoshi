One point of digital cash is to allow electronic payments, so printing
it on paper would not be useful as other than a novelty.  People would
have to scan the bit patterns back in, which would be inconvenient.
How big will a piece of digital cash be?
An electronic "dollar bill" in the simple scheme of Chaum's consists
of two parts:  (x, f(x)^(1/e).  X is a random number, f(x) is a one-way
function like MD5, and e is the exponent which could be taken to represent
the denomination of the bill.  MD5 takes 64 bytes as an input "chunk"
so that would be a natural size for x.  f(x)^(1/e) is f(x) "signed" by
the bank using exponent e, so that would be about the size of the bank's
modulus n, say 1024 bits or 128 bytes.  Probably there would be some
control information as well.  So the total size of an electronic banknote
would be 128 + 64 + a few, or about 200 bytes, maybe a little more.
To print this you'd have to Ascii-encode it, which generally expands
things by 1/3, so you'd get about 270 to 300 characters per bill/coin.
This would be around four or five lines of text, comparable to a PGP
key (and looking about as interesting - totally jumbled letters and
"Forgery" is in one sense hard and in one sense easy.  It's hard because
to create new dollar bills because you have to forge a signature using
the bank's public key (n, e).  This is equivalent to breaking at least
some uses of RSA.
But it's easy to reproduce existing electronic dollars, and you don't even
need a Xerox machine.  Just "copy dollar1 dollar2" on your PC, and repeat
the process.  Presto, plenty of dollars, all exactly the same.  Send one
to the butcher, one to the baker, and you've still got plenty more
where those came from.
Keeping this kind of re-use from occurring is one of the things that
makes electronic cash tricky.  Chaum's simple scheme has the receiver
of cash calling the bank or sending the cash there right away.  The
bank has a list of "serial numbers" for all the cash that's ever been
deposited, which it compares against to see if this is a re-use.  The
first person to deposit a dollar with a given serial number gets credit
for it; the others are told that it's worthless.
Another area that people seem a little unclear about is the difference
between electronic cash and electronic checking accounts.  A checking
account could be managed by simple RSA-signed messages (e.g. created with
PGP) saying, please transfer $X.00 to account number XYZ.  If you wanted
to buy something from someone, you'd find out what his account number
is with the bank, write up a little note like this, sign it using your
public key with PGP, and email it to the person that you wanted to buy
from.  He'd send it on to the bank and his account would get credited.
Again, you'd want to put a serial number on your check so that the guy
couldn't send it again tomorrow and get another $X.00.
Or, you could just send it directly to the bank and request the bank to
notify the seller that the funds had been transferred.  This would seem
to avoid the re-use problem.
The difference between this system and electronic cash is that the bank
knows exactly what is going on.  It sees all transactions, so it knows
which accounts are making payments to which other accounts.  This is
true of ordinary paper checking accounts as well, of course.
Electronic cash is designed so that not even the bank can tell who is
paying whom.  I withdraw some cash, say, $100.00, and I pay you $35.00
by mailing you the electronic bills.  You deposit them.  The bank has
no way of determining which particular withdrawal produced those bills
which you are depositing.  This is, more or less, how real cash works.

Update on the digital cash project
I am having some problems with the port to MSDOS, mostly due to
implicitly assuming 32-bit integers in a few places.  Probably I won't
get it working until next weekend.
To recap, the program provides Chaum-style digital cash via two
executables, one for the "players" and one for the "banker".  The
banker creates a public key which has a single modulus n and multiple
exponents, the prime numbers starting with 17.  He sends n to the
players and all is ready.
Players withdraw money by running their programs and specifying the
denominations they want to withdraw.  For example, you could withdraw
a 1, two 5's, a 10 and a 20.  This would create a file with 5 entries
to be sent to the bank.  PGP should be used to encrypt and
ascii-encode this file (for privacy) and it should be mailed to the
The banker receives this file and runs his program to RSA-sign the
values in each of the withdrawal-request entries.  This is the
"blinded cash" that Chaum describes.  Again, PGP should be used for
mailing this back to the user.
The player then has to "unblind" the file to make it "real" digital
cash.  This also changes it so that the bank won't recognize it when
it is deposited.  He uses his version of the program to do this,
producing an actual digital money file with the five "digital bills"
in it.
To pay another user, he runs another function to extract the desired
bills from this file.  Suppose he wants to extract a 1 and a 5.  This
leaves a 5, a 10 and a 20 in the original file, and creates a new
digital cash file with a 1 and a 5.  He would then use PGP again to
encrypt this for safety and mail it to the person he wants to pay.
That person can run a "check" function on the incoming digital money
to make sure it has a proper bank signature on it and is not a
forgery.  He would then mail it directly to the bank so that it could
get credited to his account.
The banker runs his program which checks the signatures on the
incoming money, looks in a database file to make sure these bills
haven't been used before, and adds these bills to the database.  (The
database stores 16 bytes per bill.)  He should then record the deposit
and perhaps send a confirmation to the depositor (my program doesn't
get involved with that).
I hope this gives a clearer picture of how the electronic money
program works.  It is a simple implementation but I think many systems
would work similarly.
I appreciated the suggestion to use cash as part of the list
management itself.  Rather than paying people who post, I wonder if it
would be better to make people pay to post.  Many people have
complained about the volume.  :)  Unfortunately, I suspect that this
would involve too much overhead for the mailing list maintainer.
Maybe the thing to do is to just get the software out there and let
people decide what they want to do with it (if anything).  I'm
probably going to take a couple more weeks to clean up the user
interface and get these bugs out, then I'll try sending it someone to
be put on the cypherpunks ftp archive.
It's nice to be able to finally sign these messages!

@_subject: Physical to digital cash, and back again 
For any real business, the customer comes from the 99.99% of the population that are not hacker/cypherpunks, not the one or two dozen people who are.  These protocols aren't at all simple for the customer, unless the vendor (the same or another vendor) provides some free software on the net or by mail to automate the process (eg PGP with a user-freindly shell for generating the key, and a script for creating an anon e-mail address).  But then we have several steps:
Pretty exhausting for the typical service industry.  Most customers
will pick the service that's easier to sign up for, even if some
ivory-tower critics criticize its security.  Security and privacy
are very easy to hype, but often difficult to prove to the layman,
who doesn't know or care about the math.  Digressing a bit,
we could use some sort of independent (not government-run please!)
certification company, which takes (perhaps in alliance with
liability insurance providers) responsibility for examining the service's computer programs and protocols and giving out "privacy ratings".
Secure vendors could then use "Whit Diffie certified, top privacy
rating" in their ads.
Also, the issue of which parts of these schemes are *legal*
is critical, but being completely overlooked.  Any lawyers
out there with comments on this?  The best protocols for legal and
illegal operations may be very different, legality of digital cash
will vary between jurisdictions, etc.  And what about
certifying agencies that call a protocol "insecure" simply because it supports activities illegal in their jurisdiction, not for any reasons of physical or software privacy?
The cases of illegality and physical/software security are
both important risk factors for the vendor, customers, and
liability insurers to consider, but ratings for each should
be quite distinct.
But this discussion is too abstract. We need a real, visceral example.
The enclosure below illustrates some of the some legal and privacy
issues of a Mom & Pop BBS operation in the pre-d-cash era.  This
service could use some privacy -- it's an on-line football game with a $35 sign-up fee and cash "prizes."  I don't know whether or not
it's legal for the vendor, but it's certainly illegal for a significant subset of potential net.customers.  There will be thousands of these little on-line services springing up in the near future, if there aren't already.  The BBS# is area code (802), but I've lost the rest of it, sorry.  You can call their voice# toll-free for more info.

Yeah, its an arms race, and we don't have time to wait for the ultimate
weapon. Similarly, it doesn't matter how ultimate the weapon is in the
hands of someone who doesn't know how to use it. I wish that the generic
security advice was separate from the IBM-flavored instructions in the PGP

Beware of the message about the security bug in the anon.penet.fi software!
If you do as requested, and send your true email address to an5877 at anon.penet.fi
then he will see both your true email address and your anonymous address
(if you have one - if you don't, you will be assigned one and he will see
that).  Any future use you make of this anonymous server (say, to post
anonymously) will appear under that same anonymous address - and this
person will know your true email address that goes with it.
an5877's message appears to be a trick, designed to collect anonymous/real
address pairs.  Johan Helsingius should take action against this trickster.
Since he is learning other people's real addresses, perhaps it would be
appropriate for his own real address to be revealed.
But, this does point out that these systems which automatically assign
anonymous addrsses have several security flaws.  Johan has already had
to introduce a "password" feature to make it more difficult to send fakemail
that appears to be from a particular email address through the server,
thus revealing the corresponding anonymous address when it is delivered.
an5877's trick is a variant on one discussed in news.admin.policy where
it is pointed out that you can mail to someone via anon.penet.fi and
ask for information; when the return mail comes back it will be from that
person's anonymous address.  So again you can pair up real and anonymous
These are serious problems.  We need some discussion of how to avoid these

Great idea!
In the meantime, I put my encrypted return address in my public key and put
them both on the existing servers. I put each line of the return address
into an 'id' of my key, so that with a little editing the return address
can be reassembled. Unfortunately, this will not work in the future,
because new revisions of PGP will not guarantee that the order of id's is
well defined.  Even then, I could number the id's. If PGP was totally bulletproof, it could handle carriage returns within a
single id, or at least an id long enough to contain a return address with
the carriage returns replaced with markers. PGP 2.2 bombs if you paste too
long a sting into an id field.

@_subject: DH for email 
Suppose you are communicating with someone using email about something
which the government wouldn't like.  Being careful, you use PGP or
something similar.
Later, the government gets wind of your activities.  They seize your
computer, recovering your encrypted secret key.  You do not have copies
of your old mail, but to your dismay, you discover that your email
service provider keeps backups of old mail.  Using a court order, the
government is able to recover copies of all of your old email.
The court orders you to reveal your pass phrase for your secret key.
Any refusal will result in your being jailed for contempt.  You are
forced to comply.  The result is that your old messages are decrypted
and used against you as evidence.
It would be good to have an alternative which would not be subject to
this kind of attack.
Diffie-Hellman key exchange is generally suitable for an interactive
environment like an encrypted telnet session or a secure serial line.
But it could be adapted to email by having each side create one or more
"key halves" in advance, and exchanging these in an initial message.
Future email could use a session key created by taking the next pair of
key halves (one from each person).  When the supply of key halves got
low, more could be generated and piggybacked with the next email message.
Such a system would be more secure against the kind of attack described
here.  There would be no possibility of reconstructing the session key
used if the key halves were destroyed after use.  You may choose to
keep your own personal copies of email, but you can delete them and be
secure in the knowledge that no attacker will be able to reconstruct
A program like PGP could be created which would automatically take care
of the bookkeeping involved with creating and exchanging key halves for
the DH algorithm.  Then users could have electronic conversations
which were freer from the threat of being coerced into revealing their
secret keys and having the contents of their mail exposed.

@_subject: Digital Cash 
Responding to Mike Diehl's comments about digital cash:
It is not really the right question to ask what digital cash "is".
It is better to ask how it might work, what it could be.
Digital cash is basically just a cryptographic technology that provides
tokens, messages, bit patterns, etc. which are (A) unforgeable, (B)
verifiable (by the institution that issues them, at least), and (C)
untraceable.  What you do with this technology is then limited only
by your imagination.
Eric Hughes has pointed out that you can use it for things having
nothing to do with cash.  Use it to represent fuel in a space game and
this way people can transfer fuel but can't create more.  Use it for
anything for which you want the quantity to be conserved.
If we want to use it as a substitute for cash, though, Mike asks what
gives it value.  There are many possible answers.  One is, as Duncan
suggested, to allow digital cash to be exchanged for regular cash.  But
this is not the only possibility.  Eric pointed out that it could be
used as a "play money" in a game, such as a Multi User Dungeon (MUD),
allowing cash to be transfered between games.  Another possibility would
be for a company to issue "digital coupons" good for discounts off of
its software products when you order them by email.  This would give the
coupons value and they could be used as the cash in a barter network,
Conceivable, a government might issue digital cash in parallel with its
paper cash.  It would then give it backing in the same way that the
paper cash is backed; among other things, you can pay your taxes in
digital cash.  This is probably not too likely among the big countries
but there are many countries in the world.
In some areas of rural England, "scrip" is used by barter networks to
help stimulate the local economies.  A twenty-first century equivalent
could use digital cash.
Mike also asks what would prevent the digital cash "bank" from just
absconding with the money, assuming that the digital cash was backed by
regular cash.  The answer is presumably the same things that stop a
regular bank from doing this.  If the cash is legal in the country of
issue, laws will allow prosecution of bankers who steal.
In the more anarchic world of international finance, people already face
the problem of safeguarding their overseas investments.  I know of a
non-profit organization that lost several hundred thousand dollars in
an overseas investment a few years ago (money it could hardly afford to
lose) due to fraud.  There are no certainties, but you can take some
care.  Invest only a small amount at first, then gradually increase your
investment as you gain confidence.  Choose a bank which has been in
business for many years.  Look at the reputations of the people behind
the bank - have they had previous positions of responsibility and trust?
These are all the kinds of things which you should do anyway, and they
should work just as well for a digital cash bank as for any other case
where you have to trust someone with your money.
Mike asks what the benefits and purpose would be for digital cash.  I
see the main benefit as allowing electronic transactions with greater
protection for consumer privacy.  Presently when you make an electronic
transaction (purchasing something from a catalog over the telephone, for
example, or buying gas with your ATM card), you as the consumer have to
trust a lot of people.  The catalog company gets your credit card number,
and you have to trust that none of the people who see it will use it
illicitly, or sell the number to criminals.  The credit card company itself
gets a full record of the transaction, and you have to trust that they will
treat this information as confidential, not sell your name to a mailing
list of people who like to purchase certain kinds of items, and safeguard
it so that computer criminals and snoopy investigators can't violate your
privacy.  Similarly, with the ATM transaction, you are trusting the bank,
the point-of-sale vendor, and many other people to keep your Personal
Identification Number (PIN) secret, and also to safeguard the records of
your transaction.
With digital cash and a smartcard, you should be able to engage in these
kinds of transactions with no organization or institution able to violate
your privacy or steal your money.  You can protect yourself, rather than
having to trust others.  This puts more power into the hands of the
Granted, in today's political climate, empowering individuals is perhaps
not as persuasive an argument as we might wish.  But I am optimistic that
as people begin to learn that there is an alternative to trusting VISA
(through such means as Chaum's article in Scientific American, for example)
and as the inevitable horror stories continue to spread about ATM fraud,
credit card fraud, and invaded privacy, political support for this proposal
will grow.  I do think that in an increasingly networked world people are
going to be more jealous about guarding the privacy they have left.  In
this sense, digital cash may be the wave of the future.  Hal Finney

@_subject: Subject lines for remailers 
Another way in which incoming and outgoing messages can be linked up
in a remailer is the Subject line.  Most of the remailers keep this the
same for incoming and outgoing messages.
Most of the remailers also have the ability to let the user change the
subject line as it goes through the remailer.  My "chain" program which
I put on soda lets you set the subject line but only in the last remailer
of the chain (so that it goes to the destination with the right subject).
If more people did that and we also adopted the convention of not having
a subject line at all for the mail up to that point, then all mail through
the remailers would have no subject and it would all look the same.
(Actually, my mailer won't conveniently let me have no subject, so I would
either have to have a blank subject or some default string.)

@_subject: Contempt of court 
Personal opinions:
People should not be able to be forced by a subpoena duces tecum to provide
incriminating documents.  The fifth amendment protection against self-
incrimination normally extends to personal papers.  There are cases
which show that corporate officers cannot avoid turning over corporate
papers even if they incriminate themselves, but personal papers are
provided much wider protection.
People can be forced to produce handwriting samples, where the content of what is written is not significant but the physical writing will be
analyzed; they can be forced to produce breath, blood or urine samples;
they can be forced to stand in a police lineup, and to repeat words which
a witness may have heard a criminal make (but the words do not carry
significance); they may be forced to submit to psychiatric evaluation.
But none of these involve giving testimony against themselves.  Producing
a personal diary or notes which provide incriminating testimony should
be protected by the fifth amendment.
By this reasoning, someone may be able to be forced to reveal an encryption
key, since that is not testimony.  But if the resulting documents, when
decrypted, are personal and contain damaging, incriminating statements,
they would not be usable in court.  To introduce them in court against
the wishes of the defendant would be a clear violation of his fifth
amendment rights.
By the same token, people are not obligated to keep records specifically
to facilitate government investigation of any crime they may have committed.
(They are required to keep normal records, such as those relating to
the income tax.)  It is perfectly permissible for people to destroy their
personal records, notebooks, mail, in any way they wish, whether those
records would be of use to law enforcement or not.  (This is not true, of
course, after receipt of a subpoena calling for those records.)  "Digital
flash paper" should be perfectly legal for all record keeping, whether
or not those records would have contained evidence of a crime.

@_subject: Weak steganography 
Several people have suggested that PGP or some similar public-key program
could be used to exchange encrypted email, then a "fake" one-time pad file
could be created to transform the PGP file into a safe plaintext.  If your
files were seized and the keys demanded, you could supply the fake OTP file
as the key which would "decrypt" the PGP file to the safe text.
Unfortunately, this doesn't presently work with PGP.  PGP puts a header at
the front of encrypted file which identifies it as a PGP file.  This includes
information about whether the file is RSA or IDEA encrypted, and if it is
RSA encrypted it includes information about which key(s) it is encrypted with.
If files are saved like this, there will be no question that they are actually
PGP files, and not the output of a one-time pad.  Any attempt to produce a
OTP key file which leads to a safe plaintext will be a transparent fabrication.
And, of course, PGP's ASCII encoding, which would usually be used for email,
boldly displays the "-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----" at the top.  If the files
were saved in this format it would be a further giveaway.
People have called for PGP to have a "stealth" mode in which it would save
files without these headers.  This would require the user to know which files
were truly PGP encrypted, what the encryption algorithm was, and of course the
key.  If this were implemented it would make PGP files much less recognizable
and the "fake OTP key" approach would be workable.
Another approach for now would be to super-encrypt the PGP file with some
other system.  A simple XOR with a repeated random bit pattern (produced by
hashing a user pass phrase) which is longer than the PGP header would be
adequate, since the non-header portion of a PGP file should be random.  Or
you could use one of the widely-available DES encryption utilities, since
these don't produce any headers, as far as I know.  But this would complicate
the process of decrypting the file.
PGP's IDEA-encrypted files, which you create with the "-c" switch to PGP,
put only a five-byte header on: a type byte, and a four-byte file length.
This information is redundant and it should be very easy for PGP to recon-
struct it if it were removed.
RSA encryption headers will be harder to remove, particularly because of
the lack of a key ID to tell which secret key to decrypt with.  We would
just try the default key, I guess.  But this would require a more extensive
set of changes to PGP.

@_subject: CASH/REMAIL: combination 
Karl Barrus posted some ideas for running a remailer which requires
payments in the form of digital cash.  I have some comments.
If I follow this, Karl will allow users to request digital-cash bills
from the bank, then require them to send one of those along with each
remailed message.  The bank then puts the bills back into the user's
account(!) leaving him with as much "money" as he started with.
This may be OK for an exercise to get the code working, but to really
have any effect the remailer should not give the money back to the
user as soon as he "spends" it.  This makes the whole thing rather
I had an idea which would be a variant of this: make the users send
you a postal-mail letter to authorize issuing another batch of digital
"stamps".  The letter could include an email address to send the
stamps to.  Maybe you could send 5 stamps per letter.
This would force the user to pay 29 cents each time he wanted a set of
stamps.  Unfortunately, he's not paying the remailer operator, but
rather the U.S. government.  But it would still limit the ability of
people to swamp the net with large numbers of messages.
(With this system, I would not anticipate that people would have
"accounts", but rather that Karl would just send out the digital stamps
and let people hold it, and use them as they mailed letters.)
Remailers might require standard-sized messages for their operation,
or refuse to pass messages larger than some limit.  This, in
conjunction with requiring per-message postage, should eliminate the
possibilities of "volume abuse" which so worried Ted Ts'o.  ("Content
abuse" is much less of an issue given the free-speech traditions on
the net.)
As it turns out, PGP compresses, then encrypts messages (usually):
The decryption phase is then:
Now, as it turns out, the decompression is self-terminating.  That
means that you can add some junk to the message after the compression
phase but before the encryption phase, and it will be automatically
ignored by the decompresser:
(This represents padding the message with N bytes after compression,
then encrypting it.)
I had a patch for an earlier version of PGP which would always pad to
1K byte boundaries using random bytes.  It was kind of annoying to use
because it made small messages quite a bit bigger.  But I think what
would be very nice would be a utility to encrypt a message which
produced one or more constant-sized files as output.  Then you would
want a corresponding program to decrypt which would put the files
together and strip the padding.
This way, all files sent to the remailer would be exactly the same
size, and it could then act as a "Mix", as Eric described, holding a
bunch of files in a batch, shuffling them, then sending them out.

@_subject: PGP vs. RIPEM 
( >>>>>>'s inserted for the benefit of George Gleason ;-)
That's great that Loompanics is covering encryption.
I think the existance of two programs is good, helping to promote some
rivalry and a certain amount of borrowing of good ideas from each other.
PGP now has a contrib directory with information and scripts to help
integrate it into mailers, an area which RIPEM has focussed on from the
PGP was originally developed on a PC and then ported to Unix, while for
RIPEM it was the other way around, I believe.  The workings of RIPEM are
more Unix-ish while PGP is more DOS-ish.  Which program seems more natural
may depend on your background.
The user community is more diverse than most people realize.  You sound
like you have somewhat more of a PC orientation than many people on the
net.  Most of the people I run into have the opposite problem - they think
everything is Unix and that the PC is just some little corner of the world
which isn't really relevant.  They think that Usenet and Unix workstations
are the de facto target environment for any communications utility.
Actually, I think your experience is more relevant - PC's at home, hooking
up to BBS's, Fidonet, and the commercial services for communications;
also, people using PC's at home and dialing into Unix boxes at school or
work.  Another big area is people using networked PC's at work, although
since we are mostly talking about freeware packages here we haven't paid
much attention to that.
Especially with encryption, which generally can't run securely on multi-
user workstations, it makes more sense to think of PC's as the target platform.
Some people are starting to have single-user systems which can run Unix,
and this may increase with time, but for now DOS is where the emphasis
should be.  Many of the PC magazines predict that Unix is dead in that
market and that Windows is the platform of choice in the future, so that
is where we should be aiming, IMO.  As Phil Zimmermann says, "skate to
where the puck will be."
I didn't really mean to open up the standard OS wars here, but it's
important to realize that encryption has unique requirements for secrecy
and security which may affect the DOS vs Unix debate.  (And yes, I know
I'm leaving out Macs, Amigas, Ataris, and who knows what else.)
The big problem, as Eric Hughes has frequently mentioned here, is the need
to integrate encryption with mailing.  I think what is really needed is
some way of dealing with people who read mail on their PC while using
some kind of terminal program or similar package to connect to a BBS,
commercial service, or Unix box.  The problem is that there are so many
different programs in use and people probably won't be willing to switch
just to get encryption.  A lot of programs have fancy features including
scripting, macro keys, etc., and switching requires learning new ways of
doing all your old stuff.

@_subject: RSA Security 
Everyone here, of course, knows that breaking the RSA encryption scheme
can be no harder than factoring huge numbers. The present security in
RSA rests in the fact that nobody has found an efficient way to do it.
At the same time, however, nobody has been able to show that it can't
be done. We are simply going on faith and past history.
The problem is that if someone were to discover a efficient method for
factoring, I don't believe that we would know about it for a long time.
For example, if by some stroke of genius, I were to discover an efficient
way to factor, you would never hear about it from me! Being the greedy
person that I am, I would say to myself: "How can I make a buck from
this?". I would probably go to the government or some company (quietly)
and say to them: "For X dollars each, I will break RSA keys for you."
The beauty is that I would not need to disclose the algorithm for
factoring. They could easily check if the results that I gave them
were correct!

@_subject: REMAIL: new remailer 
Hm... something weird happened since I didn't send out four copies of
the remailer list.
And a message I sent a while ago hasn't appeared yet...?
First, I've been told that some people are concerned about my
signature appearing on the remailer keys.  I sign every remailer key I
verify, hopefully in addition to the signature already present from
the remailer operator... so if you run a remailer, sign the key if you
haven't, and mail it to me, preferable with your public key because I
don't like "unknown signator" messages.  I will include it in the
pubkeys.tar.gz distribution I put (with Eric's help) on soda.  That
way it won't look like I'm signing every remailer key all by myself :-)
Anyway, this is a remailer I've been using for various testing
purposes, but haven't announced (and you thought I was joking when I
said people are running remailers they haven't announced :-) It is set
up in a friend's account with his permission since he is away working
in NH with no telnet priveleges.
This may become the preferred remailer on rosebud.  I have been told
by a lawyer that running a remailer from an account I no longer have
legitimate access to breaks about three laws in Texas.  :(  Maybe
eventually I'll spring for a commercial setup where I have a little
more say.
My old account (elee7h5 at rosebud.ee.uh.edu) has been locked since I am
no longer in that graduate group (or at that university for that
matter).  However, the remailer still works, since my directory
structure remains. So, I mailed to two people in charge on rosebud,
and have asked them to get back to me if they want the remailer
cancelled.  I haven't heard back, so maybe they support it!  Actually
though, since the remailer doesn't take up much space nor does it eat
much cpu, they may very well not care.
But my friend's account is still going strong :-)
I've retested the remailing functions, and here is the key (keyid BBC00D)

@_subject: REMAIL pasting syntax 
Earlier, an anonymous person asked about pasting syntax, about how to
paste in a CC: header.
The answer is: it depends on which remailer you use.  For a Hal-style
cypherpunks remailer, you would do something like this:
----------8< cut here >8----------
Request-Remailing-To: someone at somwhere
CC: I am pasting this into the header as the mail leaves
Here is my message
----------8< cut here >8----------
But, if you use Chael's remailer (since I beleive he wrote his own
software!), you would do this:
----------8< cut here >8----------
Request-Remailing-To: someone at somewhere
CC: I am pasting this into the header as the mail leaves
Here is my message
----------8< cut here >8----------
Of course, you would only want to paste at the last hop since the
remailers would trim it out otherwise.
For example, this message should have an "X-CC:" header I pasted in.

@_subject: REMAIL: digicash 
I've been experimenting with a primitive digital cash system for
remailers.  Originally I had hoped to combine the remailing and
banking functions of the elee7h5 at rosebud remailer, but for now I have
an even more primitive cash system implemented at elee6ue at rosebud.  It
seems to be performing as expected.
A digital cash accepting remailer, along with a good positive
reputation system, is the "crypto-anarchist" answer to labeling
anonymous mail with subjects and/or usernames.  (Of course, a subject
that enables anonymous mail to blend in is great - such as "Re: your
mail").  (Incidentally, since running pgp to get the signature from a
pgp-signed message is expensive, I patched the script I use for
positive reputation to give the option of checking signatures or not,
if anybody is interested.)  Currently, the only objection I've heard
to anonymous mail is "somebody can abuse it"; future remailers will
require payments, helping to address this concern.
Basically, the remailer recognizes a Digicash pasting token, and for
now the cash is a string of letters and numbers.  Before remailing,
the digicash is extracted and looked up in a cash list (which I
create).  If the cash is in the list, it is assumed to be valid, and
the list is rewritten minus the cash string just used.  If the cash
isn't present, it is assumed to be invalid, and an insufficient funds
message is remailed instead.  The remailer does not keep a list of
"spent" cash strings, so there is the possibility of duplication (once
in every 36^60 times).  As far as correlating the cash used to
individual and a message, I can only assure you I could care less
about the required bookkeeping.
The pasting token looks like the others, and you use it in a similar
way -

01/31 0936  ( BW)(TELEQUIP)
   Business Editors     HOLLIS, N.H. (JAN. 31) BUSINESS WIRE - January 31, 1994--Telequip
Corp. today announced the first available PCMCIA compatible flash
memory card with high-level embedded security functions.     The credit card sized Crypta Plus is targeted at companies
implementing secure tokens for mobile computer users.  These tokens
will allow users to conveniently communicate and access confidential
data across public computer and telecommunications networks.     Industry experts predict widespread use of secure tokens for
corporate and customer communications, database access, electronic
funds transfer, defense and government programs, and any other
activity involving confidential electronic information transfer. Sales
professionals will be able to travel with proprietary information and
communicate securely with the home office. Physicians will be able to
use tokens, loaded with patient files, to perform rounds, order tests
and even write prescriptions that can be signed with a digital
signature.  It will be possible to process and pay insurance claims
directly from the field.  Mobile computer users will conveniently
carry and securely communicate large amounts of confidential
information.     Crypta Plus cards have up to 20 Megabytes of solid-state,
nonvolatile memory and require no batteries.  The memory capacity will
increase in conjunction with technological advancements in the flash
chip industry.  The patent- pending card consists of a data storage
unit, storage-access locking circuitry, and a tamper-proof key
information substorage unit in the form of a smartcard integrated
circuit.  A stored program within the smart card integrated circuit
allows an access password to be programmed directly into the silicon
from an external source.  The locking circuitry prevents access to the
data stored on the memory card unless the user inputs the identifying password.  The smartcard integrated circuit can be used to perform cryptographic functions, including digital signatures.  It also
provides secure storage for the keys necessary to perform those
functions. The Crypta Plus card satisfies three vital needs of mobile
computer users: o   It can securely store private information in a compact, easily transportable storage device. o   It protects electronically stored data against unauthorized access
if theCrypta Plus card is lost or stolen. o   It makes cryptographic functions and secure key storage readily
availableto allow protection and authentication of data being sent to
remote sites.
   Several important technology trends have converged to make the
development of the Crypta Plus card possible.  The PCMCIA standard has
been swiftly adopted by the industry leaders in personal computing.
This allows the Crypta Plus card to operate cross-platform in most
mobile computing devices.  The explosive implementation of distributed
networks and wireless communication now makes data security a vital
tool for insuring and protecting personal and corporate interests. The rapid growth of Public-key cryptography and digital signature
standards is creating secure environments for access, transmission and
authentication of private information.     Along with U.S. Government standards for digital signatures and
encryption, Telequip will embed RSA, the popular Public-key
cryptosystem into the Crypta Plus card.  "We're excited about
Telequip's Crypta Plus technology - it's a perfect match for
distributed, robust security systems such as RSA," said Jim Bidzos,
president of RSA Data Security Inc.  The Crypta Plus card will also fully comply to the soon-to-be published PKCS 11 specification, which
will be the first open, published standard for use of Public-key
cryptography with tokens and smart cards.  PKCS, or the Public Key
Cryptography Standards, were established early in 1991 by a consortium
of RSA Data Security and its major licensees, including Microsoft,
Apple, Sun, Lotus, Digital, National Semiconductor, and many others.
The backing of the PKCS consortium members will make PKCS  11 the most
important standard for secure tokens and smartcards in the world.     Michael F. Jones, president of Telequip Corp., points out that
"Public-key cryptography and digital signatures are central to the
future of electronic commerce.  These techniques depend on
successfully keeping the private key and its operations secure.  The
company believes the Crypta Plus card is an ideal personal token for
performing private-key operations and implementing cross-platform
security.  It can be thought of as a portable object in which data,
applications and security all travel together in one convenient
package. Users will carry Crypta Plus cards with them to run
applications, store data, configure systems, sign documents and access
network resources."     --30--ed/bos     CONTACT:  Telequip Corp.     Greg Dunne, 603/881-5616

You know, this radiation experiment reminds me of another incident.
A group of African-American men were injected, without their knowledge
or consent, with live syphilis spirochaetes, and studied for a number
of years.  No attempt at therapy was ever attempted, as I recall, for
these individuals.  Here is a reference.

Correct. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.

S> were treated, were given relatively ineffective and dangerous
S> mercury therapies.
the very beginning of the study, in 1932, the subjects were given
rather innefective treatment.  From about 1933 on the focus of
the study became purely one of longterm _untreated_ syphilis. Indeed, during United States Public Health Service campaigns
against V.D. in the South, during the late '30s and into the '40s
when more effective therapies were coming into use, subjects of
the study were actively *denied* treatment; to the point of
actually pulling them out line at clinics (those who sought
treatment), telling them that they weren't supposed to be
treated, and sending them home.
This "study" was conducted under the auspices of the United
States Public Health Service, was not a secret, and ran for
40 years.

THAT'S WHAT HE GETS FOR COMPLAINING
    SAN FRANCISCO - Apple Computer Inc., after receiving a
complaint from famed scientist Carl Sagan, has changed the
internal code name for an upcoming model to "Butt-Head
Astronomer" from "Carl Sagan," the San Francisco Chronicle
    Sagan asked the company to stop using his name after an
article about the new computer appeared in MacWeek magazine, the
newspaper said.
    The Computer is one of three Apple models that will use the
PowerPC microprocessor, which was developed by an alliance of
Apple, Motorola Inc. and International Business Machines Corp.
    For those of tender sensibilities, Butt-Head Astronomer will
be known as BHA for short.

@_subject: Coming Soon From A Tentacle Near You... 
This message was posted here a while ago, describing all of the nasty things
we have in store for us. Right now we seem to be enjoying Operations SQUISH and Octopus. What else do you suppose he has in mind?
CC:     Subj:   Current Operational Status
We (operation Cyberanarchist Repression and Poison) thought you might
like an update of our current status and future plans. We have been
extremely busy! So much has happened lately! Remember when we said,
That was a reference to Operation Tick-Tick-Tick. We were really
delighted with the outcome of this attack, we made very significant
gains in our campaign, and there were some stellar fireworks. The
sequence of Usenet posts equating cyberanarchists with drug users and
Sodomites found great response. The Cyberanarchist glossary was
unchallenged! We nailed the szabo at netcom.com tentacle mercilessly, and
he is afraid to show his sickly green face any more.  The Pit Bull (His
Royal Eminence) showed up to make a fatal mistake in exposing the Szabo
tentacle, and we nailed him some too (his brilliant smear tactics give
us more ideas ourselves!). As usual, Emminent Eric has been rather
quiet. We did spoof him spectacularly with that Apology feint. `I never
wanted a brainwashed follower.' `Democracy stinks.' `I am the anti Christ.'
Ha, ha.
Tantalizing Timmy showed up a bit `out there' to further whine, evade,
and threaten, and tell us that he doesn't know anything about drugs! He
says he has a gun, and isn't afraid to use it! Fantastic! `The rumors
about high level conspiracies and drug use are false' he says. Ooops,
have you talked to Ingenuous John? (hee, hee). You guys really have to
work on getting your stories straight. It's pretty pathetic. As for the
BS, we don't know who it is you saw at your last Cypherpunk party and
their California IDs. Must have been some cardboard cutouts! Oh, what
fun. This is all in addition to the shrapnel wounds on the public lists
(we have no comment on the private ones!).
We appreciate your feedback in all areas. What did you think of the
delightful poetry? How about the Nazi Espionage story? That brought
tears to our eyes when we thought how much your own Big Macs have
surpassed the Fuhrer in their own present glories and future ambitions.
Perhaps the people `out there' on Usenet will be similarly impressed ... ?
Nevertheless, the Big Macs don't seem to understand that we have long
since lost interest in the tentacle exorcisms, although we like to
continue to play to keep our practice. We have graduated to the Big
Leagues and they are still scratching their crotches in the minors.
Full fledged exposure! The Cypherpunk Credit union for money
laundering! the black markeeting! the tax evasion! The lies in the
media! The secret mailing lists! Thank you so much for finally coming
clean (or at least opening a few windows to diminish the stench) in
some key areas. Our next projects should help encourage you to continue
this wonderful Glasnost, where before we had the KGB.
Once again, we remind you that you can relent and surrender at any
time. Some of the things we are interested in at the moment:
1. Further information on the media deceptions in Wired and NYT. These
are very difficult to unravel.
2. A complete status report of the TX bank and CA credit union. Maybe
some more info on the `real' Chaum link.
3. A complete comment by the Big Macs on their knowledge and
involvement in pseudospoofing and all the `quasi-legal' activities.
4. A complete list of all the secret mailing lists. Your subscribers to
this list would probably be interested in this too, why not post it
publicly? After all, they don't know that all the *real* development is
being done under the table. Kind of ironic, too, how long people were
asking for a `list split', not knowing that it had already been done in
secret. Ah, a pity, but that is your modus operandi.
But, since in the true spirit of warfare we must be prepared for any
eventuality, including the continued persistence and tenacity of the
enemy. So you know, here are some of the operations we are planning
over the coming weeks and months, listed in scale of seriousness and
potency. Operation SQUISH - a very sophisticated and comprehensive simultaneous
attack on many fronts that will involve a `grass roots' approach vs.
the last `top down' attack in the newsgroups. Medusa keeps asking for
our complete knowledge. This will lay it all out on the table for
everyone to examine -- a complete list of tentacles, Small Fries, Big
Macs, Poison Needles, Medusa Sisters, and Medusa. It will also be a bit
disorienting for you in the spirit of our favorite tactics of
`polymorphic paragraphs'. You really seem to get a buzz from that. If
you think that the last Usenet strike was bad, wait 'til you see what
happens with this one!
Operation Octopus - this is the multiple pseudonym and agent project.
We plan to have at least a dozen (hence the name) posting
simultaneously to many different lists and the newsgroups. But the
overhead on this is very significant, and it will take us awhile to
gear up and build the infrastructure to the point we can `engage'. You
have seen more of these agents lately `out there', but our coordinated
attack will take some more planning.
Hopefully, these operations will crack the nut. It is already wobbling,
splintering, chipping, and shaking. But this is a tough nut to crack.
The following operations are far more insidious and devastating. We
have been hinting about them in various places. They are our `secret
weapons' -- the will require some further developments, but will be
immensely effective in destabilizing your technology and `movement'.
Operation Duplicity - extremely top secret. Let's just say, you will be
seeing double, and triple, and quadruple, and ...
Operation Apocalypse - extremely top secret. Let's just say, Robert
Morris and Richard Depew would be proud ...
Of course, in the meantime your list will be subject to the same
drizzle of froth that has you so excited lately. And we'll probably
recycle some of our better artillery to strategic positions `out there'
on Usenet some more. We wish to thank T.C.May personally for all the
stellar ideas in Reputation Assault and Cyberspatial Sabotage. What's
good for the criminal is good for the police, so to speak!
Finally, just to let you know, we are going to take a momentary
breather here and scale back all the current operations somewhat to
reorganize and retrench before the next onslaught, so enjoy the
respite. Happy New Year!
p.s. you might want to see this below. This software and attack report
was part of our last strike, Operation Tick-Tick-Tick. The software for
the new operations is far more complex (you know how difficult it is
e.g. to track multiple identities well), partly the reason for the delay.

And they're off! Five ~45K messages each, five seconds apart.
And the winners are,
1) elee7h5 at rosebud.ee.uh.edu
2) hh at pmantis.berkeley.edu
3) and 4) tied, ebrandt at jarthur.claremont.edu, hfinney at shell.portal.com.
And hh at soda.berkeley.edu has tripped and DIED. Yesterday hh at cicada.berkeley.edu
died and got back up again today. Looks like either CA has fallen into the
