Ok, the exception that confirms the rule, that was a company hired by the government to do its dirty job, ie, mercenaries.
Until google, facebook, comcast, DHL, GM, Boeing, ... don't hire such services or do it themselves, they continue to be a lesser threat to the people than government is. Legally, none of them can do what you quoted above.
