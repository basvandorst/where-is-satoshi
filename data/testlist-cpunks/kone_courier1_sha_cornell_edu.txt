@_subject: Instant check system 
Jim Miller asked about the "Brady Bill" instant check system.  In the House
version no deadline is set for the nation wide system.  As for fingerprints,
it is one of the ways the bill authorizes to check back grounds.
My over payed earrend boy, Congressman Hinchy, got a copy of the bill for me
and two of my Cornell pre-law friends looked it over.  We still don't know
what they want in the end. (not counting the total ban.)  The bill did refer
to an "individual number" a lot.  It is not clear if the "individual number"
is your SS number or the serial number of the weapon.
I personly like the idea of instant check, if my privacy can be preserved.
The last thing I want is either a convicted "rights-violator" with a weapon or
someone keeping track on what I buy or don't buy.  I have been trying to keep
my life out of as many records as possable, and am a bit worried by the vage
instant check program. (is visiting a srink for depresion a sign of mental
Ther should be a way for individuals to check on their own record, as often as
they want, yet not alowing for others to check.  i.e. the sellor types in your
number (public key) and the confuser says OK or NOT OK.  You type in your
private key and see your arest record and such.
One final item, I do agree that weapon ownership is not the issue we should
talk to, but how can we protect our privacy yet keep "rights-violators" from
open access to weapons.

Another problem in this set up is:  What if "B" is caught and put in
jail/killed?  How are "D" and company (including "J, K, L" and on) going to
stay in touch?  Some one posted that useing a "I am caught" key might help
cover the trail. I think it would cut down on the uptree pateren but might not
pass on info downtree.  Would a side to side contact help?

How would one keep the cross over safe?  An "in case of loss of contact, use
PGP Key xxx?"

@_subject: taggnets 
Taggnets are also found in the main components of "home-made" bombs.  At least
as early as '85. (call it a childhood indiscretion.)  Components like high
nitrogen fertilizer and heating oil   This alows the investigator to narrow
down about when and where the components were bought.  (I had bought a large
quanty with my fathers card.) Most cases are solved because the "mad-bomber"
is follish. i.e. keeps on buying more components or explosives, after the
first bombing.  Or, like me, bought in large quantys with no real reason too.
Just something to think about.

@_subject: Digital cash 
While looking for a copy of Gresham's law, I ran accross William Brough's book
"Open mints and Free Banking".  On page 35 he writes "The more efficent money
will always drive from circulation the less efficient if the individuals who
handel money are left free to act in their own interest.  It is only when bad
money is endorsed by the State with the proprty of legal tender that it can
drive good money from circulation."
I think that as a few of the bugs are worked out of digital cash, in a free
market, it would quickly drive out paper.
