Okay, before you flame me and tell me to pipe it through
a symmetric cipher filter, hear me out.  Tape handling is
hairy, depending on what kind of functionality you want.  A regular
filter may write(2) in strangely sized blocks, not working very well
with your tape drive.
Mostly though, things get difficult when you have to/want to deal with
multiple tapes.
Although I could probably hack up "catblock" to do the job, and use
a line of the form
dump -0uBf ... | symmetric_cipher | catblock blockfactor > /dev/tape
if there exists something which already does this job, or something like it,
I'd like to know.  Now that I think about it, maybe this is the cleanest way.
PS: If there is a place where I can get reviews of the crypto software
that is out there, that'd be fab because csua just has a TON of stuff!
The "security-faq" is pretty good -- I want more! :)
Keep codin'

Hmm, I've got this a few times from people and I just wanted to clear
up a few points.
1) BSD dd doesn't treat EOT specially:
   /* ... If a partial write, and it's a character device, just warn.
          If a tape device, quit. ... */
   GNU dd (from what I remember) doesn't, either.
2) "dd" will only work safely across all tape types and all size pipes
   using the degenerate form "dd ibs=1 obs=(your_bf_here) conv=sync ...".
I'll hack up catblock today.  Who says we don't code :)

Anyone worked on, or know of a freely available, one of these beasts?

In message <961002.235706.1R8.rnr.w165w at sendai.scytale.com>, Roy M. Silvernail snooping the link
Encrypting at higher levels involves a different effort/cost
tradeoff that doesn't do much better at addressing the threat
mentioned above.  AFAIK, application-level involves modification
of every app we are interested in, and network or transport level
should probably best wait for IPv6.  I think link-layer is best
for what we need.
Come to think of it I've never seen papers on this kind of issue,
probably because I haven't looked.  Anyone got any URLs/bibliorefs
to a paper on the benefits of encryption or authentication at the
different levels of the OSI or other network models?
Thinking about it a bit more, if you only encrypt, say, telnet
then you've got a pretty predictable plaintext stream.  If you
encrypt the entire link level properly then it might be much harder
to isolate the nonvariant bits of the protocols since the port and
that kind of header info is not available to the attacker at that

@_subject: [privacy] a junk email tracer [crypto] 
Here's a little idea that I'll throw out to the sharks.
You've probably heard of people who alter their name/address slightly
when applying for credit cards, etc., so that they know when their name
has been sold on a list, and by whom.
Well I say, "why not with email?"
Consider a hack to sendmail (or whatever MDA you have) which
attempts to locate the email address given in a list of distributed
email addresses.  For example,
 vax01.na    put on web page
 vaxu53lr    sent to correspondent foo at bar.com
 vaxbl15.    put on business cards
Where crypto comes in:
You could actually have the tagged field be the encoded encryption
of the data on the right.  You'd still probably want a list to
weed out bogus addresses that decrypt to nonsense.  Or you could use
encryption to embed a tag marking it as "good" -- a
checksum, fingerprint, signature, whatever.
With an adequate MUA, you could even have it pull up the associated
description with the email as an X-source field or something.
I may not have time to implement this, which is why I threw it out here.
If you do implement it, be nice and put my email/web ptr somewhere
in the credits.  And send me a copy; I hate junk email.
CC me in your comments; this list is too voluminous.
Sorry about the long sig but the quote is appropriate.

@_subject: free ACM publications 
Cypherpunks readers may be interested in the ACM digital library,
which is open free to the public until the end of this year,
at which it becomes a rather expensive members-only luxury.
Many complete articles are available online in PDF format.
Reviews and abstracts will remain free.
A search for "encryption", "cryptanalysis" or "cryptography" in the
title and abstract reveals some interesting papers.
As usual, use but don't abuse;
I don't want to regret telling everyone about this,
particularly since I haven't started reading yet myself.
Information wants to be free:
