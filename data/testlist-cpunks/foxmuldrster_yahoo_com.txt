@_subject: [Freedombox-discuss] Freedombox Mesh Network Simulator 
These are mine:
The mesh network should be able to route packets from any geographic  location to another, merely by knowing where it (itself) is, where the  packet came from and where it's going.  There are certain aspects of  forward-transmissions for packets each FBX would have to maintain for a  period time in case one or more of the FBXs fell off the mesh and are no  longer available, which would require re-routing through a  less-than-optimal route, although given the circumstances of the FBX  "holes" that now exist in the living, dynamic mesh, perhaps may NOW  actually be THE optimal route.
I think getting away from IP addresses (except as mechanical means to  coordinate with FBX devices that indicate they're "over there in the  direction I want to send stuff"), and going entirely with geographic  addresses will solve everything.  There is still the issue of geographic  identity for a roaming target, but I think a lifetime relative to the  nature of the roaming speed for nearby FBXs would solve that as well.   We'll see.
I could be wrong.  Probably am.  My hard-headedness and stubbornness will mandate that I prove it to myself though, which I may well do this  Ever see a 42-yr old man eat crow on a mailing list?  Stay tuned... I  might just do that come Sunday evening! :-) LOL!
