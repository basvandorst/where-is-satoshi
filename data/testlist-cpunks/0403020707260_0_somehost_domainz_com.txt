Lots of suits use ipsec, and those suits run windows with pgpnet or some
commercial ipsec roadwarrior "solution".  Those seem to be the likely
majority of ipsec endpoints.
As for static ipsec links, where neither side is serving only one
person, you may be right that the majority of companies have at least
one using frees/wan.
Maybe I'm underestimating the number of corporate inter-office VPNs or
developer-to-employer tunnels, and maybe most of them use frees/wan.  I
really have no way to know.  But my impression is that developer tunnels
are quite rare, and that inter-office VPNs are outnumbered by
roadwarriors who don't run linux.
