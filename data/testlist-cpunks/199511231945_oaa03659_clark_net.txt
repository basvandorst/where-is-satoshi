As I recall, the courts have sent the message to the LE community that it's entrapment if they entice someone into doing something that they normally wouldn't do.  If you're a kiddie porn dealer, and I as a LE officer entice you to sell me some pictures of that cute 8-year-old doing some geezer, then that's not entrapment.  If I, on the other hand, try to pressure you (assuming you are a law-abiding citizen) into buying such by either misrepresenting the article in question or by threatening you with dire consequences if you don't buy, etc. - in other words, forcing or enticing you to do something you normally wouldn't do - *that's* entrapment.

Very true.  Authentication, whether strong or weak, merely says that you are who you say you are -
totally different from this "web of trust" I keep hearing about - and that is *it*.  Do you trust me
any more now than before I started signing my postings? It's well-known that most revelations of encrypted information come from "humint", not from mathematical finesse with the encryption scheme.  I especially love Oracle's idea of security - when submitting SQL to the Oracle back-end, to automate the process, you feed it your user ID and password IN THE CLEAR, ON THE COMMAND LINE.  Any weenie can run "ps -ef/ps -ax" and pipe it to grep.  The fact that Larry Ellison wont do anything about it seems to me to be idiocy of the first order, and that Oracle doesn't know what it's doing.  It's not even a good database product.  Deity only knows why people keep buying it, although that's rather off-topic ;)
