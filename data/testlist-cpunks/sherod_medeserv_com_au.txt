@_subject: Full strength Email Clients. 
Hello, I'm in search of an  *EASY TO USE* Internet Email client software
that uses full strength (outside US export restriction) RSA encryption.
It would be used for end to end encryption of Patient Pathology results,
hence the need for "full strength".
Any pointers to sites of interest?
Best Regards
