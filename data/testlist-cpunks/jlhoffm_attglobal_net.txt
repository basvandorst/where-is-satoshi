throughout the years.  Maybe I should contact this child's parents as well as their attorney.  Maybe you should do the same.  Maybe you really are a member of NAMBLA.  It certainly sounds like it.  I wonder if you would tell the parents to their face how important you think it is to preserve the information put out by the people who helped cause their son to be murdered, rather than doing something to help prevent it from happening again.

Oh, please.  Anal sex with an eight year old child is not violent?

You are wrong to protect them without knowing what they're about, Jay.  Their motto is, "Sex before eight, or it's too late."  They are referring to grown men having sex with an under-eight year old little boy.  Surely you don't mean to suggest that a website promoting intercourse with a little boy should be protected speech, do you?

If you're serious, send it.  We own a law firm.  Furthermore, a lot of the cases we handle are pro bono, especially when children are involved.   We would help in any way we can.  What you say doesn't surprise me.

In 1972 (the year before the APA unilaterally decided homosexuality was "no longer an illness") the Gay Rights Platform was drawn up at the convention of the National Coalition of Gay Organizers.  It was officially set forth at the Gay Pride March on Washington, D.C. on April 25, 1993 and has been reinforced every year since.  funding.  That was a $465 million increase over the 1997 Budget, which is more funding than all forms of cancer combined.  Current Federal Money (your tax dollars and mine) spent per  death:

On second thought, I just checked out the stupid website you mentioned.  At  (one of the webpages which offers books for sale).  The cover of one of those books shows a very young boy.  There is no possible way that child is a teenager.  You're wrong.

Here's a little something else I picked up from the same stupid website (you know...the one you say only promotes sex between teenagers and adults...)      let's say one of them is almost eight, raggedy-kneed blue-      jeans & an old slouch tweed cap, hair & eyes both the same      soft Venetian brown, body svelte as a Caravaggio      urchin-cherub ~ and the other ten-&-a-half, huge slightly      crazy green eyes, world record eyelashes, hair the color      of Lindisfarne-gospel goldleaf ~ wild enthusiasts, boastful      liars, agents of chaos, cuddle-monsters, extortionists of      toys & favors, fancy-dancers, dirty jokesters, natural-born      exiles from the Mundus Imaginalis ~ right! there must be      millions like them in these frozen flatlands, millions of      secret epiphanies in thousands of icy boxy little houses at      every point of the night-whistle-echoing nation ~ but      imagine just this once instead of staying on the Wabash      Cannonball or whatever Zephyr you disembark just here & now & finally      penetrate the mystery of these lost-town boys who might have waited      unknowingly forever for someone to notice their beauty, might have      grown old and heavy, square & dull without ever communicating      their dirty-sweet fragrance & sheer unreasoning joy to a      single poet ~ but this time you finally get off the train      in this godforsaken grain-embargoed cowburg ~ and thanks to      the whim of some nearly defunct amerindian pagan-pervert      genius locii this time at last you get to meet Jimmy & a      Joey who are precisely as imagined, feed them cheeseburgers      & pink shakes & bribe them with action-figures & gum, these      two microcosms, these two fire-clowns ~ so that all of us      in a moment of mutual unspoken relief at this shattering of      worshipful destinies, all of us suddenly gracefully have to      embrace & kiss, kiss chaste & cool on the lips & grin like      bobcats for this fortunate derailment, this whistle-stop,      this milk-run, this hobo's muscatel"

And more from this "only TEENAGERS and adults" website...
twelve-year-old boy with whom I was bonded years ago. We are standing side by side with my arm around his shoulder, in what I would consider a typical adult-child pose. My friend took one look at the picture and said, "You were lovers." To my surprise, he pointed out that there was absolutely no space between us. The boy had molded his body so that he
was in continuous contact with me from his ankle to where his shoulder fit into my armpit.  The author is classified as a violent felon, and so housed and treated, because the law defines sexual contact with a child less than eleven as a violent crime. The irony is profound. The child in question once had to go find his brother to help him remove a bothersome loose tooth because the author couldn't bear to cause him even momentary NAMBLA website that speaks of "teenagers and adults."  All they ever talk about is "boys."
