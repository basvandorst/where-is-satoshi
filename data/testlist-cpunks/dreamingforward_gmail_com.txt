The solution to the problems of state is not better cyptography.
Those are nice techniques which will be useful for other things.  The
solution to the problems of State is to fix the State.   Because the
scenario of overthrowing the government and instating a
socialists/anarchist/whatever state is not going to be a welcome
solution to the existing populace.  Absent that, you only have hiding
from the State or other minor changes which aren't ultimately
The solution for fixing the State of America (which is the first
domino in the chain) is to remember that the American Revolution
fought for the same ideals as us and USE THE LAW.  It is unambiguously
in the hands of the People.  There's no way a Court, hanging a US flag
can ignore principles of that the nation was founded on.
See  for several cracks in
the behemoth/ juggernaut of what is now "America".
So transparent as to be invisible...

No, the American Revolution was fought to bring the colonies
independence from tyranny and instigated by the Boston Tea Party
incident and the Declaration of Independence.  The latter is good to
re-read to see very pointedly the ideals held.
That may be your interpretation, but given the foundation of "which it
stands" and by the letter of the Law, you have tremendous advantage
you can leverage on you, the individual's, behalf--regardless of how
corrupt various Legislative acts have made the Law as it stands today.
Remember the Bar Association is an unconstitutional monopoly that has
intimidated people out of their own rights by convincing them that the
law belongs to them.  Not so.  Even if they argue that they wrote a
Law, it is up to the elected Official to enforce it AND the Court to
uphold it as obeying the SPIRIT of the law (not the LETTER).
Constitutionally, police have no power EXCEPT as authorized by your
elected leader.  They are not mentioned at all in the Constitution.
Frankly, the whole federal government is a mess, and if you get
arrested for some heinous crime like copying data from a corporate
server somewhere, you need to point out that the federal executive
branch (which would be probably doing the arrest) is a schizoid,
psychotic mess and should not be trusted.  (To wit:  the "Department
of Justice".... under.... the Executive Branch. WTF?  Issues of
Justice are handled by the Judicial BRANCH.  It's not up to the
Executive to decide that they're executing Justice.)
Don't believe it.  The rights remain among the People and no Court is
going to be able to argue otherwise.  The Left has GIVEN away power,
mostly to media (do you question the veracity of national news?),
which is why the Internet is so important.

That is a good issue.  In almost every case, the prisoner is more
innocent that the leaders who have killed people in cold blood,
without remorse or empathy --the textbook definition of "psychopath".
Yet there is no world police to arrest the leaders and take them to
court and see if their acts were righteous or not.
The only explanation is that lawyers are sucking the tits of Satan.
Because, it's only a very simple legal argument to make that a drug
dealer is working CONSENSUALLY in a FREE MARKET SYSTEM with products
whose effects are *mostly* limited to the INDIVIDUAL's liberty.  Even
a murder case, can be argued for, since the State has set the example.
I don't buy the idea that most prisoners are black.  I think this is
Leftist media propaganda.  I've seen prisons.  They typically
segregate the population, yet it was clear that there were just as
many whites as there were blacks, perhaps more (and this was in LA

No, you are being manipulated to giving up on your own legal system.
There is no mention of tyranny in the early colonies, not by blacks,
whites, nor the red man.
Consider this though:  do you think the Black population has cared
about the Indian when they celebrate "Black History Month" with all
their singing and celebration?
It's all theatre.

Sorry.  I should have been more clear.  I've been assaulted three
times by police fighting for justice in America.  I've seen them on
the inside.  I've mastered the Law it takes to defend yourself and in
order to do that YOU HAVE TO APPRECIATE THE BASIS OF THE LAW.
They are too thick-headed to appreciate the little guys point of view,
but if you appreciate the law, you can be the victor.
There's serious injustice as I've said happening in America.  But
nearly everyone you report to is complicit.  They are not victims.
They like their redmeat, their television, their iPhone.  Why should
they fight for those with no voice?  (That's the question I had to
answer -- and ANSWERED.)

Agreed, but remember not only are they only 1 branch of the US
government, if they're acting without the authority and direction of
the ELECTED executive, you are at a better legal position than they.
Hey, my VT220 doesn't allow italics.  And it's simpler to hold down
the shift key when typing than searching for asteriks.
Remaining in one's center yes.  Blatant corruption by a Judge, show
me.  Most every time people are victims to Judges who expect certain
kinds of proceedings that decades of lawyers have spoiled them with.
You have to remind them that it's a gov't of the People, not lawyers.
Well I'm responding also to the idea that people are victims, they are
not.  They are usually complicit actors and beneficiaries of the
SYSTEM.  My personal story is too complex about how a taser shredded
my immune system so that now I can hardly fight for anything due to
the clinical depression.

Are you sure you want to go here Juan?  Because like it or not, and no
matter how uncool or unmetro it is, cutting off your penis does not
make you a woman.  Yet the LBGQT crowd woudl debase women by calling
such crippled men "women".  Also, poop doesn't and cannot make
love--you're body rejects the material coming out of your anus, why
wouldn't be pathological?  How about men who eat poop in the psych
wards?  Should the people who are evaluating them be considered
"Pseudo-scientific garbage"?

Who to believe?  Try getting out and traveling.  You can experience
reality without believing anything.  Then you can formulate differing
opinions into new synthesis of understanding.

In what sense was it rhetorical?  Do you think he wasn't wondering
what or whom to believe amidst conflicting stories?  It's not a simple
question when the media bombards you with it.
And, sorry, Hegel is likely the only answer as it incorporates the
scientific method as well as EVERY OTHER.  Was there another?

Nice to see some old-timers in the debate.
I'll argue that there is no need NOR *desire* for the government to
kill itself, but it will be forced to deal with its weaknesses.
Forgive me if these topics have been beaten to death, I've only
recently re-entered cypherpunks domain after being away for 20 years.
The Constitution was founded on pretty solid principles:  liberty and
justice for all. If there's any problem with the government, it is
because the citizens have become weak, cowardly, or stupid perhaps all
three.  But indeed the weaknesses of the Law could hardly be analyzed
because of the immense power that the legal-political-media
establishment had acquired since WWII -- most people had simply
adapted (with TV), become numb (via psyche drugs), and were quite
content with their beef steak.
The problem isn't the government, it's that we have a society of
addicts that are farmed for GDP--and hardly anyone knows it because of
the reasons given above.  The people who DO are mostly at the bottom,
beaten down on indian reservations, or in prison already.
We really have two problems:  1) the need to address the prior wrongs
or history and force the People to deal with themselves, and 2) to
correct the weaknesses in the Constitution that allowed these problems
to grow into such monstrous proportions.
Great paper.
Great point to remind the younguns, Jim.  One major fix to all these
problems is to simply change the voting model.  The winner-takes-all
voting system and the current Constitution REQUIRES the election of
incompetence to power.  The current system does not allow the full
opinion of the electorate to be heard.  I know that PoliSci has tried
to solve this problem in the past, but it has only *recently* been
solved:  bi-valent, fractional voting
(  In short, there is
no need for primaries.  For every candidate on the ballot (say 4), the
voter gets a token to allocate however s/he wants, POSITIVE or
NEGATIVE on each.  If the voter wishes to put ALL 4 against or in
support of a candidate they can do so.  The key is:  if there are no
candidates who receive a NET positive vote THERE IS NO ELECTED
OFFICIAL for that season and the politics REVERTs back to the
next-lower down level of governance (50 regional government, for
example).  And if the election goes all the way down to city MAYORAL
elections and there still is no positive vote for a candidate, the law
reverts back to the People until someone gets a fire up their butt to
run for office with a real plan and vision that people believe in.
Think about it:  this single change is simple and dramatic,
reasonable, effective, and costs less.
Jefferson said to tear down government when it no longer serves us.
I say just change the voting model so that people can trust that their
opinion means something (votes are simply "in support "and nothing)
and that idiots don't get into office with enormous power at their

References: That's not a legitimate complaint.  The local mayor could still
protest the installation of such devices on her/his city.  If the
directive to install such devices does not come from a higher up
executive, there''s no reason not to protest if it's undesired.
The FBI, like all law enforcement, isn't supposed to act like
renegades, taking Justice into their own hands.  They can be liable
for CIVIL lawsuits (without the protection of the government) of
acting on their own like that.  (Those employees, to protect
themselves, should make sure they have the request from the President
in writing.).
Here's another schizoid thing about it all.  Quiz:  The Department of
Justice is under the Executive Branch or the Judicial Branch.  Oh, the
Executive, so it just want its own brand of Justice, is that it?
Because what's supposed to happen is that people are to be charged
with a crime by the executive, and THEN it goes in front of a Court to
be heard.
The other thing is, that the municipal, county, and state government
can say NO to such installations.  Don't complain about the federal
government, complain about your local mayor.

Yes, but John, you are mistaking media bullshit for reality.  If you
ever get busted for drugs, tell the court what you just said and that
they'd have to outlaw prime-rib and cheesecake because they are also
bad for you.
I no longer believe in media.  I've seen the Court from the inside.
What's happening is far stranger and has to do with the intimidating
power of the all-seeing-eye and how it controls everything with Latin:
