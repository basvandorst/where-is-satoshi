I find some comfort in the fact that they had to serve papers to Lavabit to get
the information they wanted. To me this says Lavabit's security was so good they
couldn't back door his machines.
Or, maybe it was cover-up, to get the information "legally." But I'm guessing
they really couldn't get what they wanted.
I'd love to see some kind of write-up by Ladar about how he did this...maybe
even a book. I expect he was just doing all the standard things any sys-admin should be
doing. It would be great to see it all written down in one place, though, as
a case study with details.
Even better: Edward Swowden as a co-author.

I can't really argue with that. I think it's very possible this is just
"parallel contruction" where they want to cover their tracks and say they got
things "legally."
Still, I have to hope it's possible to run a service such as Lavabit and have
it be so locked down that it can't be backdoored. Nothing can be 100% secure,
but secure enough that it's very, very unlikely.
I'd like to see a github project that has scripts (puppet?) to take a fresh Debian box and lock it down as much as possible, running only ssh. Those scripts could be used to create a CTF box sitting out on the open
Internet, for others to try and hack into. Pen test it to death. Update the
scripts. Make the config as perfect as possible.
Then others could take those scripts and add more modules to them, for other
services: exim, dovecot, apache, roundcube. People could pick and choose which
they want to run.
Put different boxes out there, as other CTF machines to pentest. Make it fun. Give people rewards, or some kind of recognition, if they can break
into the box.
"Encryption works," we know. End-point security's the weak link. This could be
a way to shore that up.

I should say I'm not affiliated with this project. Their contact info is here:

Thanks. I appreciate your point about how "security through obscurity" factors
into this.
I wonder, though, about putting as much of possible of this online somewhere with
tutorials, scripts, forums, etc. that your more typical sys admin could find
and use. They might not have everything, but enough to make their services
99.99% secure. Those that provide the info would probably still have some
things to their own and be 99.9999% secure. Included in the scripts and info would be ways to record artifacts of an
exploit, and quickly and securely store them where they could be used to patch.
The cost for dropping a 0day on a service provider goes through the roof.

I'm simply advocating for resources that would help sys admins develop the
skills they need. Nothing more.
