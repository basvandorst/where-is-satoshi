@_subject: Meet us on Wine Alley 
I found your address on a site about wine, food and good living. I thought that you will be interested by the services that our site offers.
 is a virtual Club for all those interested in wine in both a professional and personal capacity.
We now have more than 3900 members, both amateur and in the trade who use our site to discuss wine, buy and sell it and tell us about the best sources.
Club members use the Newsgroup of  to exchange information and experiences.  Only the other day someone asked how much a certain rare wine was worth, I asked for more information about the grape variety, which doesn't grow in France. Currently there have been more than 717 questions and replies.
There is also the small ads. column.
Among the 7 adverts placed this week there have been some really good deals including a magnum of 1945 Pichon Lalande and a 1947 Cheval blanc!
Let me make it clear -  itself does not sell or buy wine: we simply offer our members the facilites for making their own arrangements.
 is also a site supplying information in real time, particularly the latest news from winegrowers and makers via the French Press Agency (AFP).  We also have a database of more than 21,000 wines with information supplied directly to the site by winegrowers co-operatives and specialist magazines.
I should be delighted if you would come and join us.  At  you will find similarly-minded people who just want to share their love of wine.
Kind regards
