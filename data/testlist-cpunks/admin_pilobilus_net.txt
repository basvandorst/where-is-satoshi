In my mind the sudden appearance of that momentarily almost-famous
"pole dancer girlfriend" of Snowden's is of a piece with the rest
of The Snowden Affair:  It raises more questions than it answers,
and adds more reasons to suspect a double game.
Did the "pole dancer girlfriend" ever exist, and is that really
her?  I will assume so, for the sake of a fun story.  What are the
odds that she has travelled more than one mile in any direction
since Ed went walkabout, without that motion being logged for
analysis by a consortium of TLAs?  Other than "she has always
worked for us and is still passing polygraph exams," how could her
bona fides as a person of no interest be so confidently endorsed
by the public servants who let her walk away?  If on the other
hand Russia worked some hocus pocus on her behalf, why have public
officials and partisan propaganda mills that already call Snowden
a Russian agent remained silent on that subject?
Painting the young lady in question as a Russian agent who used
her pole dancing skills to steal U.S. secrets would not be hard:
The story sells itself.  Part two of the story would be how she
fluttered away free as a bird to the waiting welcome of her
Russian paymasters:  First Benghazi, now Boris and Natasha in a
Moscow love nest?  It's an outrageous story that would suit many
of our partisan political propagandists very nicely right about...
now.  But all I hear so far is crickets.

learn this by learning. They do not work it by working. They do
not reason it by using reason. To let understanding stop at what

will be destroyed on the lathe of heaven." -- Ursula K. LeGuin

I saw the first two episodes, they weren't half bad; somebody
obviously did their homework.  But then, I'm easy - Archer had me

they throw into the scripts amuse me more than they should.

Why such a suspicious attitide?  :o)
This loops back to my own initial interpretation of the Snowden
affair as a likely deception operation.  Since then my opinion of
that interpretation has been all over the map in response to new
information, but I have never had reason to doubt that the Snowden
leaks are controlled for the benefit of the U.S. National
Interest.  (Material from the second and/or third NSA leakers,
believed to be stationed in Germany, maybe not quite so much.)
Some of my speculations here are obsolete, but the general concept
that the Snowden Saga is not what it appears to be and is strongly
influenced and/or controlled by elements of the NatSec community
appears to stand up well.  I believe it's very possible that
Snowden never obtained access to the useful and relevant technical
documents that seem to be missing from his dump:

Historically, the FBI has used keyloggers to defeat PGP Disc and

Since rubber hose cryptanalysis and bugging computers are well

real progress on breaking the ciphers used in Truecrypt, I see no

The word "Truecrypt" does not appear in this summary of expert

My thoughts exactly:  Snowden never left the reservation when he
collected his docs, except in that he copied quite a lot of them
and carried them out.  Reading up on what your internal customers
use the network for is healthy and encouraged behavior for admins
- - up to the point of "sensitive sources and methods."
Ah yup.
Project scopes, code names, and functional descriptions give one a
high level but fairly definitive picture of the systems described.
 Once one knows what they are doing, the how is largely self
explanatory.  The only surprise in the whole Snowden dump is the
scope and depth of U.S. engagement in cyber-spying:  Going from
well founded suspicion to detailed documentary evidence is a
quantum leap, converting knowledge into intelligence.
The extent of Greenwald & Co. cooperation with State authorities,
vs. purely commercial motives, remains an open question.
It may be a coincidence that the first two Big Stories of the
Snowden Saga broke on the same days as the last two major events
in the Manning trial.  Greenwald knocked Chelsea's story right off
the public's radar.  I do believe in coincidences, but I try not
to bet on them, and this one casts a creepy, PsyOps kind of light
on the Snowden business.  The sale of those documents to Pierre
Omidyar also seems a little creepy to me:
One content gap that I find puzzling is the absence of references
in published Snowden docs to what was formerly called Romas/COIN
then Odyssey, a system revealed by the H.B. Gary e-mail dump.
Maybe I missed a description of that program under another name: I
have not been reading everything that comes down the pipe.
Romas/COIN was the name of Uncle Sam's cellular network, smart
phone and social media surveillance and exploitation toolkit from
Hell (see echelon2.org). As a rich source of high quality
collection in regions vital to the National Interest, I am sure
that the NSA taps into this kit's databases and/or work products,
even if it "belongs to" another Service.  Maybe somebody here
recognizes Romas/COIN as somthing appearing under another name in
Snowden docs?

Really unpopular people could anonymously crowdfund actions

Global observer attacks can be augmented by owning a substantial

somewhat customized to facilitate manipulation of traffic via a

To convince router manufacturers that they must transition to
TOR-by-default routers is a tall order:  That's a big commercial
market with a small number of dominant players, inherently aligned
with conservative a.k.a. Fascist interests.
Global many-to-many communications is correctly perceived as a
threat to the political and economic dominance of State and
Corporate institutions, formerly assured by central control of
mass scale communications for censorship and propaganda purposes.
 In this context, mass surveillance is an adaptive response that
seeks to counter-balance the "liberating" impact of the Internet
by enabling early identification and effective manipulation of
emergent mass movements and ad hoc leadership cadres.
TOR is a weapon; the U.S. State Department funds it to support the
destabilizing impact of counter-censorship and
counter-surveillance technology on other, more overtly repressive
regimes.  However, high profile busts of Hidden Service users
indicate that TOR is not quite effective enough to defeat U.S.
network surveillance assets, at least not where fixed high-value
targets are concerned.  This is consistent with U.S. policy
objectives with regard to the strength of all cryptographic
We are told that the TOR Project favors convenience and speed over
security, because this is necessary to build a large enough user
base to make the system effective.  That does not entirely make
sense, as favoring security over speed and convenience would make
the system effective regardless of the size of its user base.  It
makes more sense to imagine that the TOR Project would lose its
Federal funding and become a target for effective harassment and
manipulation by Federal security services, if TOR's security was
upgraded to be resistant to U.S. surveillance capabilities.
"Everybody knows" that effective resistance to traffic analysis of
an encrypted low-latency anonymizing network requires a constant
flow of traffic, padded as necessary with dummy packets to
maintain a constant through-put when an endpoint is idle.  This
deprives observers of the ability to match the endpoints of any
given session by analyzing the timing and number of packets at
entry and exit nodes.
But nobody implements effective cover traffic:  The reasons given
for this deficiency include concerns about bandwidth limitations
and processor overhead. 20 years ago these barriers were real,
today not so much.  I2P users have the option of hosting enough
torrents to keep cover traffic unrelated to their other uses of
that network going; this is not as effective as padding traffic to
maintain a uniform flow, but way better than no cover traffic.
TOR actively discourages file sharing, "because" this would cause
bandwidth and processor overhead problems.
I believe it would be much easier to persuade the TOR Project to
implement cover traffic, or to create a next generation TOR
network that does, than to persuade router makers to support
today's other than best practices TOR network by default.  But I'm
not sure that this can be done by any project based in a U.S.
controlled jurisdiction, as it would be contrary to the National

"Kafkatrapping" a.k.a. guilt tripping by advocates of various
social and economic reform agendas is a losing strategy.  Among
naive followers attracted to activist causes, it encourages
contempt and hostility toward audiences they must reach and
influence in order to achieve their movement's goals.  Guilt
tripping may persuade some weak minded outsiders to submissively
fall in line with the movement's agenda, but reliably alienates
opinion leaders and non-aligned activists whose support is
necessary for the movement's growth and success.  Effective
activist leaders focus on building mutually supportive
relationships with their audiences; paid infiltrators, careerists
and volunteer egomaniacs focus on dividing their audiences into
mutually hostile armed camps.
Guilt tripping is elitism.  It makes the ignorant conformist
follower feel superior, at the cost of alienating key audiences
whose support is essential for the movement's success.
The grievances of reform movements are always objections to the
abuse of power by those who have it.  Those who have power want to
keep it, and they are well positioned to employ political warfare
assets including helpful State Security services and the Public
Relations industry.  Their clandestine operators work to degrade
reform movement messaging, divide reform movement supporters, and
turn as much of the general public as possible against reform
movements.  Broadcast media outlets work to assure that the most
divisive messaging from a "movement" reaches the general public
first and loudest.  Consistent, persistent guilt trip messaging
from a reform movement reliably indicates the presence and
influence of actors inside the movement who are opposed to the
movement's stated objectives.
Effective political activists do not use or tolerate guilt
tripping, simply because it is counter productive.  Blanket
personal condemnation of one's fellow humans can and should be
called out whenever seen, on the basis that it is both factually
wrong and strategically "less than useless."

Well yeah, he's only stating the obvious:  Pervasive networked
computing is here, it's growing, and historical concepts of
'privacy' are just that, historical.  But in the context of the
show, his comments focus on the archaic paradigm of "privacy" as
something that exists naturally and is violated when State actors
pry into the private affairs of individuals.  That's a narrow
viewpoint, distorted by an increasingly irrelevant context.
Today, State actors are only one group of "privacy violators,"
alongside commercial interests and the general public itself.  The
disadvantages of a world with little or no privacy are
counterbalanced by significant advantages that are inherent in a
world of "networked everything."
The Panopticon is a prison where the guards can watch the inmates
but the inmates can not watch the guards.  The Internet is a
prison where the inmates can watch each other, and the guards:
The guards do have a better view, but their powers of observation
are no longer exclusive.
Secrets that could once be kept until after their exposure could
make no difference are now breaking open before the protected
operations are completed:
CPunks will recall Cryptome's ongoing Eyeball series, and of
course, the Total Poindexter Awareness project:  Early examples of
open source intelligence collection /and/ reporting directed
against the wardens of our modern Panopticon.  Today, projects
like CopWatch are "watching the watchers" and reporting to an
audience large enough to inconvenience our Panopticon's owners.
In the last few days we have seen random nobodies manage to save
and re-publish multiple eyewitness accounts of a staged
'terrorist' attack, directly contradicting the propaganda
narrative the event was staged to support.
The availability of more and better political intelligence
formerly concealed from the public is growing exponentially.  This
is one of several drivers of fundamental change in large scale
power relationships that is causing a panic among our present
rulers.  The United States is preparing to put down major civil
uprisings inside its own borders, again in full view of interested
members of the general public.
I sometimes compare paranoid reactions to the "loss of privacy" in
the networked world to mental telepathy:  The prospect of someone
reading your mind is frightening, until it turns out that your own
deeply held secrets are not special or unusual to a telepath who
has already "seen it all" and has /far/ worse examples to compare
your most heinous and embarrassing inner thoughts and motivations
Old Farts have major problems wrapping their heads around the
concept that a world where privacy is shrinking fast and expected
to nearly disappear is a Good Thing.  People who grew up with the
Interet, not so much.

The power to give and withhold permission for others to see you

inherently weak or intermittent, you are "in the game" whether you

from resources native to the privacy-hostile environment.  Most of

the resources found there indispensable.
However, to whatever extent you participate in an environment

too important to commerce to "just turn it off"?  Little Brother
is watching Them, and there are enough /clever/ Little Brothers
(and Sisters) out there looking to pull Big Brother's pants down
that they are becoming a real world problem.
Yes, it gives the opposition a potentially useful tool.  As there
are FAR too many dissidents of various types wandering around
loose for it to be possible to personally persecute more than a
tiny fraction of them, the main value of mass surveillance is for
aggregate content analysis, social network mapping, and predictive
modelling of large scale social behavior.  This may be useful for
targeting and calibration of propaganda, and advance deployment of
physical assets to counter populist political actions.  But so
far, Big Brother seems to suck at that kind of work...
Do the new surveillance capabilities the Internet gives military
and police agencies outweigh the educational, intelligence,
propaganda and organizational capabilities the Internet has given
to radicals of all stripes?  That remains to be seen, but I am
fairly sure that obsessive attention to "privacy" shifts the
balance of power somewhat toward those whose whole job is to
maintain the status quo.
Of course, any political organizer with any common sense knows
well enough when to keep some specific information OFF the

I don't think network surveillance had much to do with it, but in
terms of political warfare 'on the field', I believe I have seen
examples recently.  Example:
When the grand jury verdict clearing the cop who shot Michael
Brown was announced, there was a very large but orderly
demonstration in downtown Ferguson.  We know this because people
who were present posted photos and videos as it happened.
According to realtime reports posted from the scene, crowd was
ordered to disperse then immediately tear gassed.  That wasn't the
"hot story" covered by the press corps, however.
Mass media news outlets reported rioting:  USA Today used the
headline "Ferguson Burning."  But that didn't happen.  The only
"civil disturbance" was the CW attack on the crowd downtown.
The material events referenced by the propaganda narrative were
consistent with one or two mobile teams armed with molotovs and
M-80 firecrackers leading the TV cameras on a merry chase away
from the crowd downtown by simulating gunfire and setting fires:
The isolated fires were not associated with disorderly crowds or
looting. There were numerous reports of gunfire but no injuries or
reports of people seen carrying guns or shooting.  The biggest
fires were at an auto parts store, and a used car dealership where
a row of cars were burned (the owner presumably got the full
insured value of some stock that wasn't moving).  One police car
apparently burned for over an hour, as if prepared in advance to
do so in case it took longer than expected for TV news crews to
In this instance, it is very possible that network surveillance
enabled our Security Services to determine in advance that there
would be a large crowd that night, at a well organized
self-policing event unlikely to produce violence or property
damage useful to the State's propaganda mission.  Anyone could
have predicted the crowd, but its orderly behavior was not a
likely guess unless the organizers and associated social
networking traffic were under surveillance.

Collection of metadata sufficient to reconstruct all of the above

Give people roles to play in an inherently violent system, and
whoever those people are, they will begin to do violence.  That's
a general case that scales all the way up to what happens when
"honest" politicians are given a representational democracy to run.
The best part about the Milgram experiments was that a significant
number of volunteers dropped out early.  Pity it's a bit late to
send them anarchist literature and encourage them to turn out for
public events.  :D
I was thinking more along the lines of "rebel as you are told,"
the oldest scam in the book.  As a general case, the most
productive way for a well entrenched ruling class to attack people
who dislike authority figures is to provide them with models of
rebellion that do not work:  Mass market propaganda to the rescue.
That was never my intention.  I just have a strong aversion to the
'sheeple' paradigm, which I do consider a core component of "rebel
as you are told" propaganda.
I have had occasional success.  The key concept is to avoid trying
to move people all the way from their current position to the one
you would prefer them to have at one go.  Tailor the message to
the audience and try to move them ONE step in the direction you
want to see them move.  Of course, don't neglect to preach to the
choir:  How else will they be able to get on the same page and put
on a decent show?
I have been pushing this packet of books for around a year now,
and from time to time it seems to have been well received:  It's a
course in remedial politics, intended to fill basic gaps in
people's information about how populist a.k.a. anarchist politics
actually works:
The presumption that people who are notably compliant with
illegitimate  authority have a "conscience" and fixed notions of
right and wrong is questionable.  Those who comply most eagerly
include sociopathic personalities and people who are all to easily
led due to other disorders.
The "60% to 90%" cover a spectrum from grudging, minimal
compliance to elaborate and even competitive compliance, typically
related to the degree that their individual income and social
status benefit from a show of compliance.  But as the gap between
rewards promised and rewards delivered continues to widen, and the
violent excesses of our rulers become more and more obvious,
compliance will continue to decline.  This creates a growth market
for populist political agitators - a market that opponents and
supporters of authoritarian rule are already competing to capture.
Politics is about power:  Who has it, who doesn't, and how these
groups interact.  The object of political activity is to obtain
and exercise power, toward whatever ends one chooses.  Political
models and strategies that actually work in this context are
"correct" while those that do not work are "incorrect."  There is
a time and place for everything, but rarely a time when elitism,
or driving wedges between groups who have political enemies in
common with oneself, is "correct" in a functional sense.

Indeed they do.  In a context where the test subjects are
self-selected (volunteers) from a population and culture deeply
committed to elaborate, labor intensive submission to authority
(college students), with "the boss" hovering over them demanding
compliance (politely of course), most will continue "only
following orders" to the point of endangering the lives of
anonymous strangers.
I'm not sure this generalizes to describe the behavior of whole
populations in the wild, though.  Certainly, every country of any
size has more than enough pathological "followers" to field
military forces, run concentration camps, etc.  But I think "60%
to 90%" of any population is a very high estimate.
Nope:  I was expressly talking about "Those who comply most
eagerly", not the much larger number whose compliance is marginal,
grudging, or largely pretended.
You'll get no arguments from me on that point:  If I could find a
way to put that on a paying basis, I would probably not be flat
broke today.
Major clue:  The most persistent and effective populist resistance
movements have emerged from religious communities.  Our
adversaries understand this well, and spare no expense promoting
atheism to the demographic groups most likely to engage in
political activism.
Terminally corrupt, easily bought clergy - a minority among that
occupation - are kept front and center in public view by mass
media outlets, for the dual purpose of alienating as many 'natural
born rebels' as possible from religion in general, and recruiting
as many 'natural born killers' as possible into a "God and
Country" eg. God IS Country cult paradigm.
More obvious to the general public:  As an example consider the
unprecedented mass media coverage of violent crimes by police
officers, and social network propaganda campaigns like those run
by Black Lives Matter, Cop Watch, etc.
Likewise, Liberals and Conservatives are acutely aware of mass
scale economic crimes by our rulers:  The Liberals are taught to
blame Capitalism and the Conservatives to blame Socialism.  The
real perpetrators are billionaires who use Capitalist or Socialist
models where and as they provide maximum advantage; as long as the
general public fails to recognize this the game can continue - but
no matter what, the looting of national economies and attendant
reductions in the rewards of obedience continues.
I have not proposed violent excesses, I have observed them.  Big
History:  Satyagraha, Civil Rights, People Power and the Zapatista
movement never happened?  The Dutch did not bring Nazification of
their country to a grinding halt, and Iceland is still controlled
by a gang of criminal bankers?
As rationalizations go, imagining State and Corporate actors to be
all-powerful and civil society weak and helpless, is a GREAT
excuse for personal non-action.  That's why State aligned actors
consistently present these Big Lies as Eternal Truths.
An angry fighter is a losing fighter.  Things that are not "OK"
are in fact explainable, and if your explanations accurately model
the causes of Bad Things, they will enable you to develop
effective strategies for reducing or eliminating those Bad Things.
We have all been taught that Bad Things are done by Bad People,
and that the universal solution is to identify, hate, and destroy
those Bad People.  We are taught this by propagandists employed by
Bad People, so that our responses to the bad things they do will
be self defeating.  The same naive beliefs are essential for
promoting wars of economic conquest, where people must be
persuaded that certain foreign leaders are Bad People who must be
hated and destroyed.
As for removing the promised rewards of full compliance with
illegitimate authority, that is a self-solving problem if one
waits long enough.  Right now in the former Western Democracies,
those rewards are being removed by the ruling class, via wholesale
looting of national economies at the fastest pace that will not
cause them to immediately collapse.
This looting is necessary to sustain the exponential growth of
corporate enterprise, which is necessary to its own survival and
to the financial ambitions of our billionaires:  The exponential
growth of the global industrial economy has reached hard limits
imposed by geophysics; the only way to keep our billionaires'
portfolios growing is redistribution of wealth from the poor and
middle classes to the very rich.
What I mean by "this" requires the context of the paragraph the
sentence above has been removed from:  "This" is the growing gap
between rewards promised and rewards delivered, in return for
committed compliance with the demands of illegitimate authority.
You might say that I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one.
Power creates authority.  Authority is the exercise of expressly
defined power.

I'm a think I wandered into Monty Python's Argument Clinic.  The
best I can hope for is to avoid 'being hit in the head lessons.'
I hate to say it, but yes.  Example:
Bear in mind that she was a volunteer.  She could have stood down
at any moment.
My position is that holding oneself to be inherently superior to
most of the human race is elitist.
If you refer to my first post in this thread, you won't find a
hissy fit.  You will find a simple statement about my dislike for
the term 'sheeple'.
Ooh, I'm gonna get it now!  :D
Sure, as long as we are clear that the entity making that
statement is a human.  Personally, I imagine that humans in
general, and you in particular, are much more than that.

It does approach that.  One of the proofs offered by Beleivers is
that it is impossible for human beings to pass through the Van
Allen belts and live.  Because they have been called "radiation"
belts and as we all know, radiation is deadly.
1969 and later, actually.  :D
Not my field, but I do know that ham radio operators using /very/
directional high gain antennas followed the missions from Earth
orbit to the surface of the Moon, listening to and recording voice
and telemetry signals.  The cost of sending transmitters to the
Moon, and maintaining a constant stream of 100% believable signals
all the way there and back, would have been quite staggering.  The
odds of this unlikely mission failing would have approached 100%
over the course of six missions.
Cheaper to build and launch a series of Saturn V launch vehicles
with LEMs and command modules on top, than to just go ahead and
send them all the way?  At minimum it would cost the same as doing
the program for real.
Also consider that part of the price of simulating an Apollo
program would have been the cost of maintaining the illusion from
beginning to end, under the watchful eyes of thousands of
engineers who thoroughly understood the systems they were working
on, documented everything they did in minute detail, and
distributed  that documentation to other equally well informed
engineers working on related systems?  It would have cost much
more to fake the program than to actually do it.
Not to mention the 100% risk of exposure, since /one/ error in the
deception would have resulted in a chain reaction leaving the
whole deception exposed to dozens, then hundreds, then thousands
of very smart, very committed, very pissed off people.  Even the
Soviets could not have kept a lid on something like that.

Right you are, in "security" context is everything.  My take on
the Cypherpunk Way is, start with design concepts for maximum
security (!= absolute security), then trim the security
constraints back just enough to permit useful work to be done on a

And all along I thought, the sooner the Pentagon et al stood down
and let the world be overrun, the better for the human race.
Better in every measurable way, except for the net worth and
sovereign power of the wealthy and powerful gangs that sponsor and
direct those organizations.
Last I heard, police forces were not dispatched to cross borders
and kill large numbers of people, to advance the financial agendas
of some few thousands of the folks back home.  When the police do
what the military does, they become criminals even by the
definition of the laws enacted by their own masters.
Anyone who deliberately and for personal gain participates in mass
murder might be considered "bad."  I prefer to think of them as
ignorant and disinformed, aside from a minority among them who are
psychopathic and in need of minders.
So...  If I understand this correctly, the CIA, a clandestine U.S.
military service, is in the business of persuading Presidents,
elected to embody the will of the People, to their way of
thinking.  Come to think of it, their charter implicity says so.
I guess we should have dumped them when we had the chance.  IIRC a
President once said he was going do just that, too bad somebody
shot him.
Every corporate entity needs intelligence to function.  How many
need a department to promote, codify and implement torture as a
psychological weapon?  How many need a department that arms,
trains and directs gangs of killers to put inconvenient market
competitors out of business, and take over their shops?  How many
need a department to set up and run major drug smuggling
operations, to fund other violent criminal enterprises off the books
I try not to go around calling people "scumbags" and come to think
of it, I succeed.  But there's no denying that working for the CIA
in any capacity imparts a certain taint, given that it has been a
criminal enterprise more or less since its inception and shows no
signs of meaningful reform.  By "criminal" I mean, per any common
sense definition that does not duck the issue by asserting that
certain functions of State are by definition "above the law" due
to some existential necessity.  A MAFIA bookkeeper who always does
an honest day's work and never hurts anybody is not a criminal, righ
Practical alternatives to endemic, high dollar institutional
violence are limited by the inherent nature of the institutions
that carry it out:  They exist to impose the will of their masters
on whole societies.  They defeat their masters' specified enemies
by any means necessary, which covers a spectrum from propaganda
through deception, bribery and terrorism to the industrialized
mass murder we call warfare.  Try to stop them; if you show signs
of success, their masters will direct them to neutralize YOU by
any means necessary.
As things stand, we don't have enough volunteers to shut down the
killing machine by direct intervention.  If and when we do, the
emergent organizations that make it possible will also play key
roles in developing long term solutions for international conflicts.
As a practical matter, one must do what one can to stop the
bleeding; such efforts tend to be contagious, and we have ways of
spreading that contagion.  It starts with telling the truth.
Opportunities to do that keep coming faster and faster.
Most people don't know what government is, because those who
govern use a very different definition than the ones the governed
are taught:  State sovereignty is the power to rob, kidnap and
kill withing a given territorial boundary, and to defend these
powers as one's exclusive prerogative.
Anarchists are consistently depicted as violent lunatics opposed
to any form of social order.  The idea that government is based on
the consent of the governed is all well and good in a civics
class, but God forbid someone should try to actually implement
that fine theory by withdrawing their consent from particular
incarnations and/or functions of government.
I would not say so, but broadly speaking, they are directed by
political appointees who, to varying extents, run them as criminal
enterprises.  Criminal, even by the very liberal and tolerant
standards set by the State that employs them.
To me, the alternatives are painfully obvious.  Step one in a real
"war against terror" is to stop doing terrorism.  Step one in
defending a country's "way of life" is to invest in its human and
industrial infrastructure.  It certainly makes no sense to indulge
in multi-trillion dollar tax and debt funded economic bonfires
that produce nothing but paychecks, stock dividends and the odd
few million dead bodies and refugees here and there.
That's kind of like advertising oneself as the kindest, most
considerate serial killer presently at large.
It doesn't take a lifetime of study or exceptional brain power to
recognize gross offenses to the values that define human beings as
social animals fit to walk the Earth.  It does take a lifetime of
study and exceptional brain power, on the part of a whole
managerial class, to direct that society to commit such offenses
and take them for granted as regrettable necessities.
The survival value of human intelligence has not been
satisfactorily demonstrated.  Its hazards are becoming more
obvious every day.

Any bench tech with access to publicly available documentation -
and the physical hardware - should be able to identify the RF
components in any automotive control system without too much
trouble.  ECM units are fairly well RF isolated, so those that
talk to the world should normally have easily identified
connections to external antennas.  High frequency transceiver
components usually have their own RF shielded areas on the board
as well.  Cutting one wire or IC pin per unit (antenna or IC
power) should isolate it from remote access.  If necessary
functions fail, undo the mod and try elsewhere until the desired
results are obtained.
In the U.S., getting hold of ECMs to play with presents some
inconveniences:  Junk yards pull ECMs and sell them back to their
manufacturers - some nonsense about "intellectual property" seems
to be involved - so there aren't many available on the open market
to play with.  But where there's a will, a few dollars and a small
pile of pointy tools, there's a way.

a market is willing to pay enough to support and grow the
project, it can be done.  Are there potential partners and large
scale consumers for "top security through total transparency" to
make an open hardware project viable today?
One potential route would be to broker a deal to pool the
resources of specialty hardware integrators who already have a
market base for high security "solutions."  The Open Office
project pulled off something similar years ago, obtaining major
funding and support from IBM and others who wanted Microsoft out
of their hair.  So, who wants a shot at defending some of their
digital assets from outfits like NSA and GHCQ, badly enough to pay
for it?
The first place I would start shopping this "crypto anarchist"
project around would be State security services - pretty much any
small to mid-sized outfit not in BRICS or FVEYE could be a
potential market for auditable scrambler phones for military
commanders, senior elected officials, diplomatic corps and
double-nought spies.  From there to high performance servers and
workstations would be a natural progression.
I haven't looked at how the Black Phone folks are doing lately,
but that looks like the kind of product line where open hardware
might find its first viable home.
Another consideration:  One needs not necessarily own the facility
where the chips are made:  ISO quality assurance programs already
in place support client access for audit and validation.  A
contract that specifies the client's intrusive presence during
every phase of production and handling would cost extra, but a QA
process that assumes the presence of hostile actors on the shop
floor is definitely possible.  Such a process would also be needed
at a dedicated facility:  One must assume the presence of hostile
actors there, too.

NSA, NRO, ETC the same way the DoD can.  "Let's talk about the
chips in your TAO/ANT Brand scrambler phones..."  :o)
I do see problems with scaling DYI chip projects up to commercial
production numbers, and down in scale to achieve fast, high
capacity performance.  That's why I am much more interested in the
prospects of a manufacturing process built for radical
transparency, using "commercial best practice" technology at
conventional production facilities.
IMO the same kind of radical transparency should apply to all
industrial processes that pose large potential hazards to public
health & safety, i.e. nuclear power stations, transgenic
agriculture, etc.

That's exactly what I'm talking about:  Essentially taking over
the production process and working alongside facility staff, with
particular attention to choke points where validation is both
possible and productive.  ISO quality programs include provision
for onsite participation by clients; it's more a question of
money, and picking a facility that can readily accommodate the
requirements, than of getting anyone to open up any closed
process.  This might deprive one of the advantages of "commercial
trade secret" techniques belonging to the facility's owners, but
that's kind of the whole point of the exercise.  Smaller
facilities with older equipment would be better prospects than the
One should never be certain that one is receiving exactly what was
specified, regardless of validaiton.  Somewhere, the rising curve
of security costs will cross a falling curve of security risks,
and that's as good a place as any to draw a line.  Mark the other
side of the line "here be dragons - maybe."  End users can pick up
any perceived slack if and as they want to spend the money to do so.
Damn straight.  I'm especially picky about the inspection records
of nuclear power facilities; IMO they should include video of the
inspectors at work, especially in hazardous / PITA locations they
might be inclined to skip.  I recall at least one case where
reactor inspection logs were casually falsified for years, very
nearly causing a catastrophic core breach due to undetected
containment vessel deterioration located "around a corner and out
of sight" from casual view.

That's not what I have in mind at all.  Everything that touches
the production process would have to be isolated and audited.  In
practical terms, that would mean bringing the computers in
question in from offsite, with relevant software already installed
and validated.
In the context at hand, watching the whole thing play out would
consist of directing the whole process one step at a time, per a
procedure created in collaboration with the contractor's
engineering and QA departments.  Optical masks and/or equivalent
data files would be handled by client personnel and retained for
validation.  The chips that pop out would be under very stringent
property control, and quite a lot of them would be torn down and
thoroughly analyzed "at home" to validate the run.
Just like doing it at an existing commercial facility, with the
added advantage of much better control of physical access,
hardware, etc. at the dedicated facility. Whether that advantage
would be worth the extra costs, vs. real security improvements,
depends on how reliable the post-production tear down and analysis
of end product components is considered.  "A difference that makes
no difference is no difference."
If it really is impossible to build a trusted CPU with an
untrusted CPU, then it is not possible to build a trusted CPU.
Fortunately, trust is not an absolute and there are ways to build
relatively trustworthy systems from relatively untrustworthy
components.  A quote to the effect of "I do not care who votes, I
only care who counts the votes" comes to mind but I'm too lazy to
look it up right now.
I think that in the engineering and business worlds, trust is
always a point on a cost curve.
When Trust and Security are considered as absolutes, the costs of
maintaining them rise exponentially until the protected assets die
of resource starvation.  Civilization as we know it is presently
following the path of demanding absolute security, provided by
rulers vested with absolute trust, to early termination.  Getting
more on the practical business of making IC chips into the public
domain and widely distributed, enabling faster and decentralized
recovery of today's industrial capabilities, is one of the
benefits of open hardware development projects.
The objectives of an open IC project include providing protections
against institutional sabotage, but also the creation of
protocols, documents and data that can be re-used and improved
over time.  Policies and protocols necessary to assure adequate
transparency, including repeatability, would amount to enlarging
the GPL ecosystem to encompass computer hardware as well as
software.  If such a project can't produce products that are cost
effective for end users, it will remain at most a theme park ride
for misguided investors.  The "high security" angle looks like a
place where potential customers and nearly off-the-shelf
capabilities meet.

Other tracking vectors available to State level actors include:
* Owning and operating a large fraction of the routers in the
network.  This can be concealed very effectively by using a cloud
server to host all the routers in one place, with exits all over the
world via transparent proxies.  "All in one place" means, monitored
and manipulated in realtime to shape traffic and identify users.
* Monitoring exit node traffic to record browser fingerprints,
cleartext of any data transmitted between the TOR user and any
server on the Internet, and associating these with behavior patterns
indicating a personal interests profile, likely time zones, etc.
* Diverting exit node traffic through a hostile router equipped with
"real" Certificate Authority signing keys negates SSL completely -
connecting to a server via SSH over TOR is the same as connecting to
the server without SSH, if your adversary is NSA.
* Injecting exploits and implants into the TOR user's inbound
traffic from sites on the "normal" Internet, custom tailored to
"climb out of" the TOR browser and take over the user's system.
All of the above are within known capabilities at NSA and, most
likely, Israeli, Chinese and Russian security services.  It is
possible that their biggest problem is tripping over each other's
feet while interfering with TOR users.
Any contact with NSA owned (Facebook) or NSA partner (Google)
services creates big, greasy fingerprints that make tracking anyone
anywhere much easier.
A VPN does not even attempt to conceal the identities of users from
any actor who can watch both ends of the connection.  A VPN will
stop low tech adversaries like MPAA/RIAA goons who go after people
sharing files; NSA and its peers, not so much.  Not to mention that
the VPN provider's logs know all and, if handed over or stolen, tell
Generally speaking, TOR and similar systems may delay but will not
prevent the identification of frequent users, paired with their exit
node traffic and its content.  Repeatedly using /any/ anonymizing
protocol from one location more or less guarantees your correct ID
lands in a database with a summary of what your anonymous traffic
One-off use of TOR via the TAILS operating system on a "clean"
laptop at an open WiFi router might be enough to prevent you and
your traffic from being logged.
SSH in general and VPN providers in particular are transparent to
outfits like NSA.  Using them with TOR only becomes part of a
profile that eventually narrows down to one user - you.
Maybe not.  Needle vs. haystack and all that.  But again, if you use
the same physical Internet connection to repeatedly do "anonymous"
things, it would be very good if these things were of no real
interest to our Security Services.
I have run TOR relays from time to time.  As long as you are not
running an exit node, nothing bad will happen.  And at least you
know you are adding one "honest" router to the network - unless your
box has been rooted and you don't know who really controls it.
There's mine, for what it's worth.  Te anonymity provided by TOR
(and i2p, Mixmaster, Freenet, etc.) is very limited even in best
case scenarios.  These tools simply can't work when a hostile actor
effectively sees all, knows all, and can fuck with any connection on
demand.  On the brighter side most private, corporate and criminal
attackers would be completely unable to penetrate the security
provided by TOR (or etc.), unless they are in a position to ask the
NSA or a comparable Security Service to do it for them.

I guess we're stuck with Eye Of Sauron and Balrog.  Too bad, this
is a much more Lovecraftian issue IMO:  We are being pulled into a
place where all the angles are "wrong," and watching the most
merciful thing in the world - the inability of hostile actors to
correlate all the contents of the Internet - starting to crumble
away for reals.
Couple of things I can see to work on:
* Publicize this as a quantum leap in network security threats,
requiring new trust models and comms protocols across the board,
to every audience that is likely to understand the problem and
respond proactively.
* Review RFC 6973, Privacy Considerations For Internet Protocols,
and work to amplify/expand sections relevant to what we are
learning about large scale threat actors and their behavior as
observed in the wild.  This RFC is only two years old, so changes
now may have a large impact on results later.
* Think about building an ecosystem of repositories for hashes and
signatures, and protocols for monitoring consensus and assigning
relative trust values to reduce reliance on repo signing keys as
guarantors of software integrity.  Developing comms protocols for
this network would also contribute to general solutions for
hardening networks against the capabilities of our new overlords.
* Think hard about open projects to reverse engineer IC chips with
attention to manufacturer sabotage.  It seems to me that the
likely venue for this would be non-aligned nations (so-called)
with a vested interest in pooling their resources to push back
against universal surveillance & sabotage capabilities of the
Superpowers and their special pets.
*  Keep pressure on all fronts already being worked, i.e.
replacing the HTTPS protocol with something that actually works in
the sense of costing a lot more to defeat.  Make the opposition
spend more money when and wherever possible.
Considering the choice of an apparently competent security
oriented venue to "pen test to destruction" as reported, I wonder
WTF that was about.  Does somebody with control of the resources
used WANT their capabilities publicly disclosed?  If so, was this
a strategic decision from the top, or an act of systemic sabotage
by a lower level actor within the organization in question?  So
many questions, so few clues... so far.

That was my first reaction as well:  But on close inspection he
seems take the exponential growth of universal surveillance as a
given, while the ability to correlate the collected information
into actionable intelligence can and should be restricted to large
organizations:  "Most privacy laws exist to block government
actions. A few exist to block private institutional actions. But
none exist to block individuals' actions."
I interpret this as a response to the accelerating progress of
open source collection and analysis into contexts formerly
monopolized by State and Corporate actors.  A war of sorts is
already underway on this front; else why is Barrett Brown doing
time for the crime of investigative journalism?  Nobody stands to
lose more in a truly open society than our professional secret
keepers and sanctioned violators of the secrets of others.  Like
the good folks who pay the bills at In-Q-Tel.
Recent events including the exposure of Federal employee records
and the integration of ICWatch data into Wikileaks' searchable
archives may be weighing heavily on the minds of State and
Corporate strategists.  What good is owning a Panopticon if the
prisoners have data terminals where they can watch the guards and
their employers as they go about their daily lives?
Secrecy as we know it may be on the way out:  With the advent of
networked everything, the secrecy tax Julian Assange wrote about
years ago keeps growing and may reach a tipping point where State
and Corporate secrecy no longer pays.
Propaganda as we know it may be on the way out:  With the advent
of networked everybody, identity groups and market segments
created and manipulated by broadcast propaganda are running on
inertia.  The 'ego casting' and 'echo chamber' effects that
segregate the Internet today are at best leaky containers whose
walls are getting thinner all the time.
I wouldn't mind a world where privacy is a thing of the past, as
long as the playing field is reasonably level.  Control of access
to information is the key to controlling whole societies; both
secrecy and propaganda are essential to the operation of any
repressive regime.  Could authoritarian State and Corporate
institutions exist in a world without privacy, where bad faith
actors have no hiding places?  A world where control of news,
information, education and entertainment is diffused across tens
of millions of actors?

The end of "privacy as we know it" is only a dystopian scenario if
the institutions of authoritarian governance survive in the
post-privacy world.  I don't believe they can survive, because the
same network infrastructure that has already made so much formerly
"private" information public also shifts the balance of power away
from established institutions in fundamental ways.
Keeping State and Corporate secrets out of public view is becoming
progressively more difficult, while the mechanism of ad-hoc self
organizing "smart mob" actions arising from the public at large is
an emergent challenge to established power centers.  If and as
these trends continue to accelerate, the nature of political power
will eventually be transformed.
The opposition takes this prospect very seriously, and is fighting
back through automation of intelligence analysis, adaptive enemies
lists, strategic deployment of reputation management,
astroturfing, censorship, adaptive signal boosting and
degradation, spoofing and disinformation, coordination of
conventional propaganda across formerly isolated domains, etc. etc.
The future I envision is not a dystopia per Orwell or Huxley,
because these models presume the survival of large States and
continued concentration of power in the hands of a ruling elite.
I think that one way or another, large scale authoritarian rule is
on the way out.  One way is the continued development of
established trends in information technology's impact on large
scale social behavior.  The other way is the pending collapse of
the global material economy and substantial re-localization of
production and commerce.  Together, these environmental pressures
drive adaptive responses that are /very/ unfavorable to the
interests of our present rulers.

Truecrypt is not extinct.  Before its developers decided to stop

practical applications.  After its developers decided to stop

Nothing changed, except that if you don't have a copy of Truecrypt
you will have to find one can be verified as authentic via digital
signatures made from known good packages.  This is not hard, so if
you can not do it you should not trust /any/ cryptographic tool
until you have learned more about network security.
A recent in-depth security audit of Truecrpt found room for
improvement but no "show stoppers."  A more recent report asserts
that Truecrypt is "insecure" on Microsoft operating systems.
Examination of that claim reveals that the Microsoft operating
systems themselves, not Truecrypt, contain the security flaw in
question.  Where "security" is a major concern the use of
Microsoft products is ruled out, due to the availability of much
more secure alternatives; so this particular claim is not relevant.
Truecrypt will eventually become obsolete due to changes in the

That's the way both military and commercial contracting usually
works in the U.S. as well:  The vendor makes a deal with the
purchasing agent, x units for y dollars, informally and off the
record.  Then the purchasing agent revises the specification so
that only the vendor in question can qualify.  The competitive
bidding process then proceeds normally, on the record, and as far
as the audit trail is concerned it's all perfectly legal.
The kickbacks are laundered in various ways; the most popular
method for military purchasing agents is for the vendors to hire
them as consultants when they leave the service, with
extraordinary pay and bonuses for little to no work performed.
Lots of other scams are also used, but the system described above
is probably the most widely used.

I am not inclined to believe that a "simple zip file" can be
downloaded anonymously, without employing extraordinary OpSec
procedures that would incidentally render javascript useless for
tracking purposes.  Not if the adversaries in your threat model
include any official agency of any of the FVEYE countries, or any
of the major private contractors working with them.
The network itself is the trap, with or without javascript, with
or without obfuscation via TOR or etc.  I would be much more
concerned with the handling of those downloaded files on the local
machine - if a trap is suspected, zero day exploits hidden in the
files should be assumed.

Good ideas in this thread so far.  What I would add is, get the F
away from population centers; they are very hungry machines that
will start to fail in very bad ways whenever any of their major
inputs are substantially reduced for more than a few weeks - even
without panic and martial law factored in.
On moving way out of town:  Sooner is better, because as the
industrial economy crumbles everyone will get the same bright idea
and that land ain't empty.  It's occupied by communities where it
takes time to learn the human landscape and build trust
relationships.  On arrival start working to establish oneself in
an economic role that will continue to pay off in the form of
mutual aid and bartering of labor and commodities, as the value of
Federal Reserve Notes spirals down.
As for cash money, I like silver way more than gold:  People will
kill you much sooner for gold than silver, and the value of silver
has been steadily rising due to industrial applications drawing
down the world supply faster than mining is able to replace it.
Another thing to think about is identifying technology that will
stay relevant to the practical concerns of feeding and housing
people in your local economy when international supply chains go
sideways for months or years at a time.  Learn what is and isn't
important by getting involved in the actual work, and get on top
of how to run and fix that stuff, /then/ stockpile spare parts and
In short, start building the world of 2100 today.  It's going to
be built one way or another; early adopters will have more
problems to solve and go down more blind alleys, but that's the
price of coming out on top in the long run.

Add to this the well established security axiom across all

Also: Edward Snowden denies making a deal with the Russian secret service
I would be surprised if he did deliver docs to the Russians.  Now
that we have had a better look at him, it seems that our Mr.
Snowden is a bit of a fiend for OpSec.  As such, I can't see him
carrying red hot docs, or the means of accessing them, around with
him after confirmed delivery to Greenwald & Co.  In the first
place, doing so would make him a more valuable target for multiple
State actors.  Second, it would provide a big reward to anyone who
might have managed to snatch him and turn him inside out; if he
had nothing, it would at least provide him the satisfaction of
knowing that his captors got nothing of value out of him.
Since it's very credible that Russia was not his intended
destination, the concept of buying his way in with classified
information (a la Lee Oswald) just doesn't fit.  Russia's handling
of Snowden so far has been consistent with their propaganda
objective of appearing to be morally superior to their US/NATO
adversaries in Cold War II.  One might also note that Snowden has
always spoken politely of his Russian hosts but has not made any
overtly pro-Russian propaganda broadcasts.

Altruism, mentioned earlier, is hard wired into that; otherwise,
you don't get the trust relationships or the assistance necessary
to get relevant skills and experience.  Natural selection has
given humans a strong predisposition for sharing and mutual aid;
it takes generations to beat it out of a population, and even then
it just keeps popping right back up.

Thanks for the heads up - the last time you posted part 1, I found i
I would say the author was politically naive.  His list of reforms
that a hypothetical Dictator of the United States could implement
to fix things, essentially consists of abolishing the functions of
the State in one sweeping blow, and (presumably) letting the
infallible Market replace them with something better.  But then I
realized he was pushing offshore Real Estate by promoting the idea
that "nothing can be done" to improve conditions in the U.S.
He also seems like applying the Laws O' Physics to large scale
human problems, which I'm all for.  But he manages to breeze right
past the inconvenient truth that a human population crash will be
well underway by the end of the century if not WAY sooner; I guess
that would make overseas Real Estate sound less desirable as a
retirement solution.
In re the Deep State, I'm all about "destroy the motherfucker," as
that's a guaranteed winning position:  It has already destroyed
itself, in that no human agency will be able to turn it from the
course it is committed to:  Perpetual exponential growth inside a
closed container.
The question is, how to "destroy the motherfucker" in a manner
that makes things better instead of worse?  Or, how best to
mitigate the human costs of the Deep State's self destruction.  My
preferred solution:  A revival of populist politics, in the sense
of large numbers of "regular folks" doing whatever it takes to
steal back some useful amount of the power that their rulers have
stolen from them over the last ... um ... history of Western
Here's some docs about that, the kind of info that's surprisingly
hard to dig up even from "radical" sources:

I assumed this:  This essay describes the Deep State as "national policy decisions
... being forged by a small group of power elite ... bound
together by shared class interests" and "the political process as
being dominated by corporate interests which coalesce into
factions and compete to guide policy."
The TPP and similar deals under negotiation indicate that the
'establishment' in question is trans-national.  The content of
these negotiations indicates that its agenda is, as always, more
money and power for the ruling class at any expense to anyone else.
I just call it real life.
Per my own pet theories, today's Deep State will self destruct by
virtue of its own existence:  Unbreakable commitments vs. Laws o'
Thermodynamics, never mind the details.  In that model, the actual
"fall" of the Deep State is already in progress, as part of a
complex and turbulent transitional period with historically
unprecedented features.  We do live in interesting times.

social landscape is the Internet:  Analysis and exploitation of
group behavior in this new medium is all the rage in propaganda,

monopoly on propaganda, and enables rapid ad hoc organization and
large scale action by segments of the great unwashed public.

Now y'all done set me off.  Stand back, I'm a gonna RANT.
I'm a think Cari would be right at home on the Group W bench, and
I don't think anyone will call her "moral enough to join the Army
and burn women kids houses and villages" after being listed as a
troll and/or spammer on Cypherpunks.
In the English language, every meaning of the word "fuck," except
one, references violence or damage.  I'm gonna fuck you up, he
really got fucked over, they fucked us out of it, this fucking
shit sucks.  "Fuck you" is an expression of anger or challenge.
Conversational use of the word "fuck" is commonplace in the
military services and among economically and otherwise repressed
minority populations, but much less so in "polite" society where
all forms of routine violence are kept out of sight or at least
have lace doilies on top of them.
I have long held that the true meaning of "fuck" reflects a
profound social psychosis, normalized through centuries of common
usage and elaborate rationalizations, where sex IS violence.  When
the word "violence" is understood in the context of Anarchist or
Libertarian ideology as "violation" of the personal integrity of
another by force, deception or strategic subterfuge, numerous
everyday examples of sexual assault, sexual repression and sexual
exploitation come to mind.  (Voice over, Eric Idle:  "Now we see
the violence inherent in the system!")
I got no time for "Liberal Feminism" 'cause that word Liberal
denotes a "loyal opposition" to Establishment institutions based
on violence.  Liberals complain politely to their rulers, and are
kind to people they personally know, so it's not their fault if
their path to personal comfort and security is paved with the
bones of murdered children.
The Women's Lib faction of the New Left complained rudely, and set
their sights on personal power and dominance, vs. the mere comfort
and security that their Liberal counterparts still aspire to:  A
"radical movement" with not one bad thing to say about mass murder
as long as their favored team is doing it.
The fall of Saigon and what came after provides a wonderful
"teachable moment" in U.S. political history:  A coalition of
Pacifist using Joan Baez as their front man took out a full page
ad in the Times, calling out Hanoi for carrying out massive purges
in "south" Vietnam.  A coalition of New Left groups using Hanoi
Jane as their front man responded with a full page ad in the
Times, calling out the Pacifists as counter-revolutionary running
dogs and congratulating their comrades in arms overseas.
I am an Emma Goldman and/or Simone de Beauvoir kind of feminist. I
was apparently born to be an anarchist, and I like people, so this
alignment is more or less inevitable.

War is public murder for private profit.  I don't know of any
counter-examples.  Again we are up against a collective psychosis,
normalized by a long history of public acceptance and elaborate
rationalizations.  Sometimes one sees Bad Guys vs. Worse Guys, but
whenever it's Guys vs. Guys the best that can be accomplished is
some amount of damage control.  Everyone who takes up arms to
settle the disputes of their rulers and de facto owners is a
traitor to the human race as a whole.
The "fog of war" has another name, propaganda, and all sides of
every armed conflict write press releases to establish that their
only motive is "necessary self defence," or the currently popular
"responsibility to protect others."  The other side of every armed
conflict always started it, and the regular folks on the other
side of that border deserve whatever happens to them because they
failed to stop it.
Too much factual information about war results in large numbers of
people banding together to have a go at kicking the war machine to
pieces.  So never mind that "ain't gonna study war no more" crap;
study the fuck out of war and encourage others to do likewise.

Collaborative actions based on a sane balance between individual
and community interests are possible, history provides numerous
examples at scales ranging from the family and village to tribe
and nation.  With the exception of defective individuals, human
beings are naturally inclined to form communities, to identify
with those communities, and to work in the common interests of
those communities.  I call the people who lack this natural
inclination "defective" as their actions tend toward negative
impacts on group survival in the long term.
Today we have a really big problem in the form of really big
countries:  Human communities do not scale to that size.  Compare
the "community values" performance of Iceland, population 1/3
million, to the performance of the good ole U.S.A., population
360+ million.
Attempts to scale community values to the size of a large country
always involve creating administrative classes, insular
communities of professionals in commercial and political
governance who facilitate artificial "bonds of community" between
massive numbers of strangers who will never meet.  Viola, rent
seeking absentee landlords who employ armed guards to enforce
their orders.  If communities regulated by these institutions are
small enough, it is possible for the people to regulate their
regulators; but somewhere between 1/3 and 300 million population,
the balance of power shifts disastrously toward the managerial
class, which becomes a ruling class.
Expositions of political theory are supposed to end with a formula
for creating Utopian outcomes, and a call to action.  Sorry, I'm
out of stock on those items and the shop down the street was
busted for selling toxic imitations.  But I do think that those
who occupy themselves with building, maintaining and defending
sane communities, where and as opportunities to do so arise, will
be big winners compared to those who remain attached to
authoritarian top-down rule by any name.

The word "collectivism" carries a lot of baggage, as it has been
flown as a banner over many authoritarian, violent dictatorships
"of the proletariat."  But the base concept of concern for the
well being of one's community as integral to one's own well being
has also been called compassion, honor and common sense.
Darwinian evolution does not favor the me-first individualist,
however strong, dominant, awesome, etc. that individual may be.
Humans have a genetic predisposition to form families, villages
and tribes, to identify with them and hold the interests of the
group at co-equal to self interest.  Purely self centered motives
are socially pathological, and Darwinian evolution selects against
this trait:  Because the awesome dominance of the "fittest" has
negative long term survival value, compared to those who work at
maintaining a strong, resilient community that provides a
favorable environment for the whole community's progeny out to the
Nth generation.  When the smartest guys in the room tell us
otherwise, they are not mistaken:  They are lying.  The more power
is afforded to purely self-interested socioeconomic "winners," the
more their actions damage the long term viability of the community.
Big problems arise when unnaturally large "communities," i.e.
States exist, because they can not exist without the services of
an elite group of political and economic power brokers who provide
millions (!) of subjects with a convincing illusion of "community"
with people they will never meet in real life.  Deception alone
won't do the job, so armed guards must also be employed to enforce
the orders of these facilitators.  Viola:  Rent-seeking absentee
landlords, serving their own interests at the expense of the
ersatz "communities" they rule.  It's all downhill from there.
"Democracy" so-called, an attempt at community self regulation
among strangers who will never meet, does not scale well.  My
favorite historical example is the response of Iceland and the
United States to the "financial crisis" of 2008.  Iceland,
population 1/3 million, responded as a human community, "regulated
the regulators" and has since jailed corrupt bankers who failed to
flee the country in time.  The United States, population 360+
million, responded as directed by the perpetrators of a massive
fraud, and rewarded them handsomely for their efforts.
Any -ism that is proposed to replace the policies of an existing
large State without eliminating that State, promising Utopian
outcomes, is at best a shockingly ignorant error in judgement.
But it is more likely a deliberate swindle backed by socially
pathological "individuals" and interest groups.  If the -ism
involves a large State with a putative monopoly on violence (as
violation: robbery, kidnapping, murder), it's just one more brand
label and PR campaign for Fascism.
Any -ism that proposes breaking up large States into small,
independent communities governed without delegating decision
making authority to "representatives" is difficult to implement
anywhere the modern State has taken root.  Intellectual types
rarely approve of any such scheme, because it would mean trusting
people to "do the right thing" of their own accord, without
morally and mentally superior guidance from On High.  But I am
confident that people who implement such schemes where and as
possible stand the best chance of producing societies worth living
in.  We are heading into a global industrial and human population
crash that will produce numerous local opportunities to do just that
And that's why I look forward to the End Of The World with
considerable optimism.  By definition the real "collectivists"
will be the long term winners, and I don't think that will be a
Bad Thing.

Google employs two contractors with an army of humans to review
websites for "quality". Among other things they check for keyword
stuffing, hidden text irrelevant to the site's content, etc.; on
discovery, offending sites are de-rated and "sandboxed" so that
only searches for the exact URL of the offender's site appear in
Google search results. But an SEO contractor with hundreds of
totally ignorant clients (i.e., hundreds of clients) can spread a
well paid (or personal grudge based) suppression campaign like the
one described across hundreds of domains to keep the spam alive
and working.
The distribution of "search spam" that is referenced here could be
bad luck - some sleazy SEO contractor cut and pasted the text just
because it was natural language and contained specific terms
relevant to some of their customers' sites.  Or, and IMO more
likely, someone contracted to have the info in question removed
from the Internet by poisoning search indexes.
Either way, if you put up a web page that has the relevant text in
it, that page should rise above the irrelevant crap in search
results within a couple of months.  The specific search terms you
want to become findable should be included in an H1 header at or
near the top of the page, and in the first paragraph.  Naming an
image on the page to include these words is an undocumented but
effective trick.  The same words and phrases should be included in
the "description" meta-tag field of the page header.  (The
"keywords" meta-tag is ignored by search engines that use natural
language analysis to categorize pages, i.e. all search engines today
For best results, ask folks on THIS list (and elsewhere) to go out
of their way to put links to your own counter-attacking page on
their own websites, with search terms that have been poisoned by
the SEO contractor as the visible text of the hyperlink.  Links on
a half dozen pages with Google page ranks of 2 or above can work
Much as I hate to say this, setting up a Google Analytics account
and adding their tracking code to your counter-attack page is a
good idea, because pages with the analytics.js code will get
crawled and indexed faster.  People who "care about privacy" won't
be affected because their browsers won't download or execute the
A saboteur who has to hide his weaponized text from human website
visitors (and the "owners" of the websites used) can't compete

"Assad must go" has been the uniform propaganda theme across all
Western media outlets since the day the Obama Admimistration first
called the Syrian government a "regime."
NGOs sent teams into Syria a couple of years ago with the mission
of finding out what the "Syrian in the street" thinks about all
this.  Their uniform position:  All foreign intervention must go.
But alas, now that U.S. sponsored proxy forces have taken over
substantial economic assets in Syria, there will be no removing
them without foreign intervention; even if Uncle Sam turns off the
money tap, ISIS will just keep going:  Deeply depleted Syrian
armed forces won't be able to remove them.  In terms of real

A while back I was reading a training doc for intelligence
analysts that used Iran in one of its examples.  Per this text,
Iran is believed to be working to prevent a U.S. invasion by doing
whatever it can to keep U.S. forces busy elsewhere in its
neighborhood, drawing down U.S. manpower and material resources
and denying the U.S. safe access to staging areas, well controlled
rear areas and flanks, etc.
So... if successful, Iran's nuclear weapons program would render
their present defence strategy obsolete, presumably closing out
their sponsorship of "destabilizing" forces in the region.  If
Iran gets The Bomb, U.S. sponsored "stabilization" elsewhere in
Iran's neighborhood would most likely get a big boost.  It's a
win/win proposition for the U.S. and Iran, unless of course the
U.S. National Interest requires the annexation of Iran - which it
does, as Iran sits right in the middle of the future U.S.
Protectorate of Pipelineistan.
Taking in the larger picture, I would agree with General Turgidson
that we can not allow a mineshaft gap.

The attached chart referenced above, is one I have been
circulating for months.  It illustrates the result of boom and
bust cycles in the U.S. domestic economy.  With every boom and
bust cycle in the U.S. domestic economy, the income and assets gap
between the upper and lower classes grows wider.  That's probably
why these cycles exist.
Fun fact:  According to an article published in Forbes a couple of
years ago, 400 people own 1/2 the capital assets in the United
States.  Democratic self governance?  Yeah right, that's possible
in a Company Town that spans a continent.
Aside from quoting a little bit of Big Lie propaganda from a
history professor (the notion that Abe Lincoln campaigned as an
abolitionist), the article itself is entirely in line with my own

"The power elite is composed of political, economic, and military
men, but this instituted elite is frequently in some tension: it
comes together only on certain coinciding points and only on
certain occasions of ‘crisis.’ In the long peace of the nineteenth
century, the military were not in the high councils of state, not
of the political directorate, and neither were the economic men —
they made raids upon the state but they did not join its
directorate. During the ‘thirties, the political man was
ascendant. Now the military and the corporate men are in top
"Of the three types of circle that compose the power elite today,
it is the military that has benefited the most in its enhanced
power, although the corporate circles have also become more
explicitly intrenched in the more public decision-making circles.
It is the professional politician that has lost the most, so much
that in examining the events and decisions, one is tempted to
speak of a political vacuum in which the corporate rich and the
high warlord, in their coinciding interests, rule.
Excerpt:  Mentioned this earlier, mentioning it again:
National Security and Double Government, Michael J. Glennon,
Harvard National Security Journal, 2014
"The United States has, in short, moved beyond a mere imperial
presidency to a bifurcated  system — a structure of double
government — in which even the President now exercises little
substantive control over the overall direction of U.S. national
security policy. Whereas Britain’s dual institutions evolved
towards a concealed republic, America’s have evolved in the
opposite direction, toward  greater centralization, less
accountability, and emergent autocracy."

In Central Florida in the 1960s, midwinter frost was very often
present in the morning in most open areas (think suburban yards).
By the 1980s frost was very rarely seen, and many who have lived
in the area since 2000 or so have never seen frost.  From at least
the 1960s through 1980s, seasonal hard freezes were seen during
most winters.  Since around 2000, hard freezes only happen when
major storm fronts come down from the Arctic.
In the same part of the world, a widespread and very visible
native plant called the beauty berry would produce the purple
berries it is named for in early fall, shortly after the last hot
day of the year.  This performance was synchronized across
hundreds of square miles.  Beginning in the late 1990s, the beauty
berry is no longer a reliable predictor of the weather:  It now
produces its berries in isolated patches, across a span of about
six weeks.
I think NASA, NOAA, and about 97% of geophysicists have noticed a
few things, too.  The physical models that account for and now
predict their observations are stupidly simple and easy to
understand - if one is willing to make the effort.

The SanBerdino* iPhone Massacre:  A Post Mortem
In a case involving "terrorism" and any "Middle Eastern person,"
the FBI has unlawful legal authority to hand a locked iPhone
containing material evidence to the NSA for cracking.  NSA hands
the phone back, locked up with timestamps undisturbed, along with
a pen drive holding the decrypted content of the device.  All of
this is done under "Top Secret, Sensitive Compartmentalized
Information" cover, as befits the work of a Double Nought Spy
service with a license to do whatever the fuck they want "to
protect and preserve America's Freedom."
Apple got a great publicity boost, Uncle got a shot at legalizing
all of the above and more, and that's the whole story of the big
public controversy.  As for the super-duper security sideshow
about how Apple uses unique hard coded keys to encrypt iPhone
contents, OK fine:  It's actually a decent system, and having the
details out there will result in a bump in sales to "security
conscious" consumers including Apple's /large/ consumer base in
the Federal sector.
Anybody who doubts that the NSA can routinely crack iPhone
encryption - when they have the physical device in hand - haven't
thought it through:  The problem is to read one number stored on
an IC chip.  We have the technology to do that, and the NSA has
the budget, facilities, mandate, and as many practice iPhones as
Apple will sell them.  They also have the resources to "borrow"
any technical documents they need from Apple, with or without
asking permission or telling Apple it happened.  iPhones are
common and reading out the contents of "locked" devices is one of
the reasons why the U.S. has a big budget technical intelligence
service.  It is more than safe to assume that reading out a locked
iPhone is a solved problem at NSA, a documented routine procedure.
 Processing the paperwork for an FBI request based on the word
"terrorism" probably took longer than cracking the iPhone.
The pretended "inability" of the FBI to obtain the contents of a
"Terrorist iPhone" was Security Theater, pure and simple.
Checking out the details of the narrative was necessary to
accurately assess the SanBerdino iPhone Massacre as Security
Theater, but that does not mean it was ever anything but that:  A
set piece show, attempting to set a precedent legalizing forced
Federal back doors in all digital devices made by vendors under
U.S. jurisdiction.

My take, just for the hell of it:
1)  At least the best known early vaccines, and today's flu
vaccines, are placebos.
This is based on British public health statistics, consistently
showing mortality attributed to contagious diseases in radical
collapse before the introduction of vaccines against same, with no
noticeable acceleration in that collapse after the introduction of
the vaccines.  Long story short:  The entire impact of sanitary
sewer systems, safer water supplies, public health policy, public
health education and improved medical treatments for contagious
illness have been attributed to vaccines.
The studies most often cited in support of the effectiveness of
flu vaccines share a methodological error which, when corrected,
eliminates the appearance that flu vaccines have any effect,
either way, on mortality stats.  Long article, well worth reading:
- -matter/307723/
or 2)  Vaccines probably do not "cause" autism.  The illusion that
they do would be present either way, as Autistim Spectrum
disorders normally become apparent as developmental delays and
atypical behaviors at about the same age children are given their
first multiple doses of vaccines.  I do think it is very likely
that vaccination triggers earlier appearance of these symptoms due
to the systemic stress of immune system overload, toxic
preservatives, etc. produced by the vaccines.
There are so many possible chemical drivers of subtle, complex,
not-understood neurological disorders like autism that singling
out one cause for an "epidemic" would require detailed studies of
comparable populations who, for instance, do and do not eat
manufactured foodlike product (anything not accurately labelled
"organic"), do and do not live in households that use novel
biochemicals daily (soaps and detergents with synthetic
components, anything "scented", etc.), do and do not live in
regions subject to major environmental toxicity, etc.  Lots of
luck getting that funded.
In summary:
Immunology is the science that tells us how vaccines should work.
 It is a very complex technical discipline, looking at massively
complex organic processes.  Any long term, motivated effort by
immunologists to produce arguments for or against the
effectiveness of vaccines should produce the desired "proofs."
Funding is only available for studies that /assume/ vaccines work.
Epidemiology is the science that can tell us whether or not
vaccines work.  It is a fairly simple and straightforward
discipline, easily understandable by any literate person who makes
the effort, and it tells us that vaccines do not work.
A possible exception:  Veterinary vaccines might actually work.
If so, only because in the process of developing them, massively
iterated "terminal experiments" are possible.  Not so with humans,
alas; all one has to go on there is "according to our PharmaChem
funded research, this /should/ work," and "hey, at least it does
not appear to kill people outright, so where's the harm?"
Personally, I don't use them.

I was thinking along similar lines, given that "Fuck you, I do what I want" is as good a working definition of Punk as any.  On the other hand there is the Cypher- component of the title, so herding the anarchists in that general direction topic-wise is a community service in the category of maintenance:  A thankless menial task that makes the rest Anarchy is a journey, not a destination, so there is no point at which one can hang up a "mission accomplished" banner.  But Dilbert's pointy haired boss just got orders from /his/ boss to put back doors in the company's crypto-enabled products:

vs. It would not be accurate to say that the Cypherpunks have won the Crypto Wars that too is a journey, not a destination.  But damn.
Meanwhile, kicking around some of the "real world" topics that make crypto-anarchy relevant and necessary IRL seems appropriate to me, as long as the crypto- side of the equation doesn't get drowned out by the -anarchy side.

Hardware considerations are inherent to the creation and solution of

attacking the platforms it runs on.  The 'internet of things' creates a
massive comms attack surface, also best solved at the platform level
i.e. signals discipline.  When the scope of a project includes
non-attribution by 3rd parties, hit and run network access via tightly

* Positively preventing laptop WiFi signals from being broadcast

The "black box" in recently made motor vehicles is the Electronic
Control Module, a computer usually located under the dashboard on the
passenger side, right against the firewall.  It reads sensors and runs
servos throughout the engine, and stores diagnostic error messages
about same.  Today's version of a "racing cam" is a custom chip
installed in the ECM.  A modern automotive engine can not run with its
ECM disconnected.
The ECM also accepts inputs from the driver's controls, runs the
anti-lock braking servos, and controls dashboard readouts.  Some can
even drive the car, as Michael Hastings seems to have learned the hard
In recent vehicles equipped with GPS, the receiver should normally be
integral to the ECM, as is the radio that makes push updates to ECM
software and/or hostile remote control of the vehicle possible.
Factory supported LoJack style security systems and RF door keys would
also be integral to the ECM.
Details will vary, but ECMs made by one manufacturer for all of its
vehicles are usually very similar to one another.  Maintenance manuals
relevant to the make, model and year of the vehicle in question will
"tell all" - or at least, tell enough - if you can access the right ones
Most paranoid motor vehicle end users (I almost said "owners," silly
me) would be quite happy with their ECM's functions, IF its radios
were silenced.  Once the physical components of those radios have been
identified, "let me count the ways" to disable them without killing
the vehicle.
And that's were a project digging out those details, doing
constructive sabotage and publishing the details and results in one
place for e-z user access seems like a good idea to me.

I like the generic term "syndicate" for any association of persons,
including meta-associations of groups, seeking common goals in support
of common interests.  Its vaguely ominous connotations tend to
counteract the spin doctored implications of other terminology.
The first corporate charters were in effect for a limited time, with
assigned missions to benefit the interests of the Crown or, in nominal
democracies, the public interest.  Today, corporate persons are
immortal, mutable in form and function, and "the public interest" is
broadly interpreted as economic activity of any kind.
In present usage, a corporation is a fictitious person created by
private fiat per a State-delegated "legal right," and itself has full
civil rights in matters pertaining to commerce.  Today's standard
boiler plate corporate charters specify a corporation's mission as
"all lawful purposes."
So in modern usage, a corporation is a commercial syndicate with
special privileges granted by the State.
How can one "peacefully" tear the dominant syndicates ruling an entire
civilization to pieces?  Those who own and administer those syndicates
have devoted their lives to the acquisition and retention of power, at
the expense of others and in competition against a broad spectrum of
rivals and adversaries.  The modern Democratic State exists for the
sole purpose of protecting and advancing the interests of dominant
economic syndicates and their owners by any means necessary, with
deadly force topping the go-to list.
A whole art and science of nonviolent strategic conflict addresses
methods of applying coercive social and economic measures to modify
the behavior of dominant syndicates including their State
sponsor/clients.  But an existential threat to these syndicates will
ultimately result in their application of deadly force, and a response
in kind.
Anarchy is not a proposed form of government or social order; it is an
informed critique of governments and social orders.  Or it is a
delusional belief system indoctrinated by propaganda.  Or it is
violent opposition to social order of any kind.  Depends who you ask.
If you want an anarchistic society, you will need to keep units of
sovereign governance small enough that everyone can observe and play
an active role in their governance.  You need to govern that State in
a manner that never delegates decision making power; decision making
by consensus assures that very few non-emergency decisions will be
made at all; thus, State interference in private affairs will be very
In short, you need to model your State as Bands, Tribes and Nations
governed by open Councils acting on consensus only.  And you need to
site it on a world where no other kind of State exists or can arise,
because hierarchal governance in a caste system includes efficiencies
that will enable other States to take yours over shortly after they
see advantages in doing so.  At best your Anarchistic State may
survive by imitating the organizational methods of antagonistic States
- - but then, you will no longer have an Anarchistic State.
The problem with "revolution" is semantic:  We are taught that a
revolution is an armed conflict that replaces one gang of rulers with
another gang of rulers, who may or may not bring plans for a new
social and economic structure with them.
My favorite definition of "revolution" equates it to "the world turned
upside down."
We are taught that revolutions initiate radical changes in social and
economic systems, but I maintain that revolutions are the end result
of radical changes in social and economic behavior.  We are taught
that Great Leaders with Great Ideas change the world, but I maintain
that changes in technology, population and environmental conditions
change the world:  Those Great Leaders with their Great Ideas show up
taken place.  They represent new dominant syndicates, seeking to
displace institutions of governance created by and for the exclusive
benefit of earlier dominant syndicates.  Their role is to modify the
institutions of State power to codify, control and exploit the new
order, for the sole benefit of the new dominant syndicates.
According to this model, the "shooting war" phase of a real revolution
serves the sole purpose of removing dead-end resistance to rule by new
dominant syndicates that have already eclipsed the power of previously
dominant syndicates.
The French and American Revolutions removed the institutions of
Monarchy to make way for a New World Order where insurgent Mercantile
and Industrialist factions share power with the older "landed"
Aristocracy.  That New World Order developed under Monarchy; its
revolutions only restructured political power to reflect a new
arrangement of economic powers already in place, and establish the new
dominant syndicates as its "legitimate" rulers.
No evolution, no revolution.  Unless by "revolution" one means
overthrowing the State to replace it with a new State administering
the same social and economic systems the old State evolved to control
and exploit.  In this case, revolutionaries are those who seek power
for its own sake through violent means; that is not likely to end well.
The real future includes the collapse of industrial economies,
accelerated looting of under-defended territories, and a major human
population crash.  This is the picture presented by current and
historical geophysical data.  Any plan or strategy that does not work
in this context does not work.
Absent a paradigm shift that replaces "progress" with "disaster
mitigation, management and recovery," application of political theory
and practice can only produce worse outcomes, not better ones.
My proposed solution is radical decentralization of industry and
agriculture; adaptation of "low technology" not dependent on
centralized heavy industry to replace "high technology" where and as
it has real survival value; moving as many people as far away from
population centers as possible; and distributing field tested
strategies and technologies for the above as widely as possible while
the networks and economies to do so are still up and running.
Large scale industrial processes that systematically destroy the
essential survival resources of future generations have to be halted
as soon as possible.  Hydraulic fracturing to harvest petrochemicals
permanently destroys water tables.  It is now decades too late to
"stop" global warming, but not too late to limit the rate of onset,
severity, and duration of large scale climactic disruptions on the way
to a "new normal."  Genetically engineered 'food' crops destroy
topsoil ecologies, poison water supplies and threaten the genetic
integrity of plant species necessary to large scale human survival.
The longer these and other grossly destructive industrial activities
continue, the lower the resulting long term carrying capacity for
human population in affected regions.
Preparation for and mitigation of the "end of the world as we know it"
provides more than a lifetime of challenging, satisfying, useful work.
 Any real progress in these areas will produce a better future,
sooner, for more people.
Ready?  Go!

In what I call a "real" revolution, way more than 99% of the real work
is nonviolent by nature.  Organic changes in the actual process of
social and economic life precede and drive the pressure to change
political and economic institutions rendered obsolete by changes in
the way people actually live.  Efforts expressly targeting obsolete
governing institutions for radical change are also inherently
nonviolent at their inception; only violent counter-attack by
established institutions threatened by organic change motivates public
support for armed resistance.  In turn, homegrown armed insurgencies
depend on the committed support of large networks of non-combatants
for their survival and success.
But there is a limit to the power of strictly nonviolent force;
generally speaking, policy adjustments in commercial and State
institutions can be accomplished by non-violent means, while
successful efforts to affect the abolition or radical restructuring of
commercial and State institutions usually includes armed conflict
during the endgame.  Conversion of a Liberal Fascist State and its
dominant industries to some kind of "level playing field" would be a
very radical change affecting the entire power structure that defines
commercial and State roles and activities; this is MOST unlikely to be
accomplished without prying some people's "cold, dead fingers" off the
levers of power.
Semantics:  Applying "principles for principled ways for us to
interact" is exactly what I meant by "an informed critique of
governments and social orders."  :o)
Direct Democracy a.k.a. Mob Rule is one of my favorite political
concepts; I spread its gospel, and promote it by actually doing it
every chance I get.  But resistance to onerous economic and political
governance is not, in itself, a form of governance; it is a feedback
process which, when successful, governs the governors by
counterbalancing the economic and political power of dominant
syndicates.  My version of Anarchy is the study and practice of Direct
I'll say, and how!  What I was describing is governance as practiced
by many so-called "primitive" people.
Perhaps I should have said, "If you want to go from high level
abstractions to methods that can be implemented in the real world, you
might benefit from considering historical examples."
Consider the example of Iceland, a model democracy where 1/3 million
people have recently demonstrated that self governance is possible
electorate to observe its State and Corporate institutions in action.
Iceland is fortunate in that, at present, the United States sees no
major benefit in interfering with Iceland's internal affairs:  Because
Iceland is a de facto U.S. protectorate, functionally if not
politically part of NATO.  Geographical isolation is Iceland's saving
grace, but alas, it's not one that most of the human race can duplicate.
One thing I appreciate about Anarchists is that they can fight like
cats and dogs over political bullshit, without losing an inch of
respect and solidarity.  Liberals, for instance, often don't make that
cut - which I think is very unfortunate, since "their hearts are in
the right place."
To do that we "have to" explicitly define our terms, distinguish
historical data from abstract constructs, and clearly state material
objectives to assure that our language and data are relevant to the
work at hand.
I am careful to distinguish between a "revolution" that installs a
regime that is responsive to the social and economic demands of the
people as a whole, vs. a "revolution" that installs a regime that
forcibly dictates a social and economic order to the people.  Both are
called "revolutions" but most of the resemblance ends there.
Blatantly repressive Fascist dictatorships call their rise to power
"revolutions" and their autocratic rule "democracy."
A syndicate that has become a dominant force through commercial
competition, by fair means and foul, is already waging economic war
against whatever syndicates its rise to power may inconvenience, and
vice versa.  When an emergent syndicate's growing economic power
threatens to displace syndicates who control political institutions,
overt political conflicts follow.  When the structural roots of the
conflict are sufficiently broad, deep and irreconcilable, a
"revolution" that changes the form of government to accommodate new
industrial, economic and (therefore) political and social realities
may follow.
Although such revolutions often include "shooting wars" the presence
of politically motivated gunfire is not in itself a revolution, nor a
necessary indicator of one.
War takes many forms.  Publicly funded mass murder for private profit
is only one of them.  Shutting down an industry through boycotts,
strikes and blockades is an act of economic warfare.  Destroying the
perceived legitimacy of State institutions through propaganda is an
example of political warfare.
My version of anarchist theory is a study of the dynamics of power in
human social behavior.  The State acts as a referee and enforcer in
conflicts between individuals and between syndicates, in support of
the stability of the dominant syndicates in the territory governed by
the State.  (Example:  The U.S. Federal government defines the
National Interest as the growth of the GNP and profitability of U.S.
based corporate industries.  In many policy contexts and documents,
the National Interest has replaced National Defense as the stated
beneficiary of military actions.)
As changes in technology, population and environmental variables drive
the rise and fall of dominant syndicates, stagnant or declining
syndicates may use their established relationships with the State to
cheat and take advantage, in an effort to retain their dominant
positions.  (A routine example:  Eternal Copyright and DMCA etc. for
media syndicates, conteracting the collapse to near zero of the cost
of reproducing and distributing "creative works.")  Rising syndicates
must acquire enough economic and social power to successfully
challenge both the market dominance of declining syndicates /and/ the
power of the State as it is exercised on behalf of the declining
When changes in real large scale power relationships happen, and the
State fails to adapt itself to these changes due to institutional
commitments to declining syndicates, revolution follows.
This model is exactly contrary to our cradle to grave indoctrination
in the Great Men and Great Ideas model of historical progress, where
revolutions /cause/ radical changes in the world of human affairs.  In
that context, the model I describe makes no sense at all.  But in the
context of the history of technology, it makes almost TOO much sense:
I view anarchist theory and practice as a discipline enabling the
peasant classes of society to form ad hoc syndicates that develop and
exercise social and economic power of their own.  Our rulers seem to
agree with me on this; anarchy has been suppressed by all means
available to ruling class interests since its first appearance in the
Enlightenment era.
Representative Democracy, the "authorized version" of Enlightenment
political organization, attempts to deliver power to the governed via
the electoral process.  I think we can agree that, at best, this
method does not scale well.  But as the old IWW slogan says, "Direct
action gets the goods."
Maybe I'm not expressing myself very well:  All these examples of
things I seem to "deny" are central to my view of how the world
actually works.  Cognitive dissonance may also be at work here:  I
look back at my personal struggles with political concepts and
constantly ask, "Why the hell did it take so long to figure this shit
In the world of human imagination, anything is possible because
wishing makes all things so.  In the physical world, inflexible laws
are self-enforced and can not be wished away.  In the geophysical
world, global warming is just one driver of industrial civilization's
pending collapse:
The slowing but still exponential growth of the human population is
another; the flattening curve of food production capacity and rising
curve of food demand are crossing now.  Topsoil, water, phosphates,
fuel and other essential inputs to agriculture are now approaching
peak extraction / exploitation rates.  This is in addition to, not
because of, the problems inherent in global warming.
Under these conditions the collapse of State and corporate power,
relative to their present massive extent, seems inevitable.
Opportunities for anarchists will be /very/ abundant, and Nature
itself will decide which courses of action are "right."
Back in the 1970s there was a bit of an "appropriate technology"
movement in the same geographic/cultural locus that eventually
produced those strange Cypherpunk critters.  That same gaggle of crazy
misfits got me started tracking geophysical issues way back then.
Today, alas:  But also, this and more like it:
Yup.  This here's the kind of bullshit that makes the flowers grow.

When dredging the Internet for information, I am sure you won't have
much trouble picking out the State sponsored anarchist literature and
pseudo-radical propaganda fronts:  Rebel As You Are Told is one of the
oldest and most powerful political warfare strategies in the
opposition's playbook.
Anarchists don't worry much about labeling sources and concepts as,
for instance, Left or Right.  The relevant question is, Useful or Not?
 In addition to State directed wannabe anarchists who rebel as they
are told, we also have a bumper crop of people who believe that adding
the prefix an- or anarcho- to the name of any archaic, failed or
outright delusional "political philosophy" makes it hip and relevant.
A lot of anarchist literature does not appear to be political.
Anarchists also make a point of reading and exploiting the
opposition's textbooks; there are such things as laws of physics,
natural processes, principles of strategy, etc. that hold constant no
matter who studies them.  "It's a piss poor pitiful Anarchist, who
refuses to use the State's resources against the State's interests."
Just now I am reading this:
It's an in depth survey of political warfare theory and practice in
the context of politically motivated popular uprisings.  There's not a
bit of Anarchy in it, except that everything in it is of potential use
to anarchists.  While reading just substitute self rule or autonomy
for "Democracy," and anarchist or radical for "democrat," and viola:
Radical literature fit to be suppressed by any self respecting
sovereign State.  (The U.S. Federal government tolerates and even
funds this kind of literature, because it is intended for distribution
in "unfriendly regimes" overseas.)
All of these titles are relevant to practical anarchy:
The Tao Te Ching can rightly be called an anarchist classic.  I quote
it more often than any other source, both in correspondence and to
myself.  I like the D.C. Lau translation:

famous Anarchists of the 20th century.  She was a Russian Jew who moved
to America as soon as she was old enough and raised hell non-stop from
then on.  At the height of her career she was the most popular political
speaker in the U.S. of A.

Fermi's Paradox?  Per its .com address:
"The Fermi Paradox is the apparent contradiction between the high
probability extraterrestrial civilizations' existence and the lack of
contact with such civilizations."
I don't mean to diss the "inevitable self destruction" model.  My own
conclusion is that it's in progress here and now and can not be
stopped by any human agency.  But while the end of civilization as we
know it may be unthinkable for Civilized people and institutions,
leading to the illusion that it means extinction, it is not
unsurvivable.  Humans are the toughest weeds Nature ever made, capable
of living on pack ice or dry rock desert for half the year armed only
with Neolithic technology ... and loving it.  What will the first
couple of Post Apocalyptic generations make out of the mangled
landscapes and derelict infrastructure of Civilization?  A new kind of
civilization, of course.
That thing that happened in Europe after the Black Death?  Homo Sap
ain't seen nothing yet:  This time it's global, and post-scarcity is
among the possible outcomes.
We don't see interstellar "civilizations" very often, because those
who did not get over making everything bigger and more powerful for
sake of bigness and power didn't make it.  For reals.  Some of those
gamma bursts may be industrial accidents, or Bad Outcomes to MAD based
defense strategies (an especially stupid kind of industrial accident).
If the absence of torrents of long range EM message traffic is
surprising, that's only because we presume aliens talk with strings
and tin cans "just like us."  If the absence of star drive signatures
is surprising, it's more likely that our assumptions about what those
signatures would be are faulty, than that there are no interstellar
voyagers riding the starwinds.  If the absence of physical visitors is
surprising, that just means a lot of people have not taken a hard
critical look at UFO investigations:  Failure to invade and loot or
otherwise dominate a technologically weaker species' cradle planet may
be evidence of the presence of extraterrestrial intelligence, rather
than its absence.
In my view practical anarchism is much more about developing
adaptations for conditions after the fall of Civilization, than with
making Civilization fall.  The latter task has already been done for
us gratis [not], by the Powers and Principalities of the world.
Building the best future possible for kids born in 2150 is gonna be a
fuckton of work, and we better get as much done in advance as possible.

Edit to include:  The TOR project believes in human rights, except the
rights of persons accused of crimes to be held innocent until proven
guilty, and to publicly confront their accusers in a neutral, public
Court.  The TOR Project believes in and exercises the rights of
risk-averse employers to discipline and discharge victims of malicious

against de-anonymization at will by any malicious or compromised

Lest we forget, Chelsea Manning used TOR to move massive amounts of data
to Wikileaks.  One can argue that Ed Snowden found what he was allowed
to find and shipped it to Greenwald & Co. under the approving gaze of
some compartment at NSA; Manning, not so much.  Billions of dollars
worth of damage were done to the U.S. National Interest, which is why
she rates a sentence of slow death by ritualistic torture.
This recording was never supposed to see the light of day, but it walked
right out of a tightly secured base and onto the Internet within hours:
Manning tells all, including how and why to do that thing:
She would have gotten away with it, too, if some "individual" who needs
not be named had not sold her for cheap.
Onion routing can be a useful part of a complete operational security

The 'collateral murder' video hit Iraq during negotiations with the
3rd (?) post-conquest iteration of an allegedly sovereign Iraqi
government for continued U.S. occupation and control of Iraq.  It
pissed the Iraqi public off so badly that continued 100% immunity from
local prosecution of U.S. persons for any and all crimes including
murder was taken off the table.  In consequence of this, the U.S.
occupation force was pulled out of Iraq.  This was more than a little
inconvenient, it was bloody expensive.
The U.S. proxy force "formerly known as" ISIS have a dual mission:
West of the Syria/Iraq border, the ongoing destabilization of Syria to
prevent construction of oil & gas pipelines from Iran to a
BRICS-friendly Mediterranean seaport.  East of the border, to force
the Iraqis to allow U.S. occupation forces back in to "protect" Iraq
from an invading armed force and assure continued US/NATO control of
Iraqi oil.
The Cablegate and War Diaries releases both stirred diplomatic
anthills, complicating or terminating numerous U.S. foreign policy
operations in progress, causing direct losses on numerous fronts and
imposing global scale damage control tasks.  All of the above cost
money - a damn lot of it - and tied up human resources that would have
otherwise been very productively engaged in business as usual, i.e.
looting the planet.
Compare and contrast this impact to that of the well controlled
Snowden leak, which has caused a bit of embarrassment while serving
the practical purpose of putting the U.S. civilian population on
notice that Big Brother really is watching their every move.  On the
domestic political warfare front, State and Corporate actors would not
necessarily view this as a Bad Thing, as cultivating paranoia is one
of their long term self-defense missions.
Somebody probably located in Germany has since handed the world NSA
docs with more practical impact on U.S. espionage operations than the
whole Snowden Affair to date, and the U.S. public at large has no idea
it even happened.  Propaganda costs money and nobody on this side of
the Atlantic seems to be interested in paying for play in this case.
I would not call that a 'fact' without considering that physically
mailing storage media has its own inherent risks.  IIRC, Wikileaks'
advertised postal addresses are in "Five Eyes" territory, so nothing
will be delivered via post without e-z and unavoidable State
inspection and approval.  Arranging any physical delivery method that
might be more secure would require two-way communication in advance
with Wikileaks, so why not simplicate matters by using the same
"secure" comms channel to transmit the docs and have done with it?

Oh lookout-
Legitimacy implies a sanctioning Authority.
Speaking of mail vs. network transport of leakish dox...
The point of failure for a mail order drugs market is the sender:
Receivers are scattered all over and at least "slightly" hard to
identify, if the network side is not breached.  But the sender's
organization is small in number and, if suspected, easy to put a mail
cover on.
The point of failure for a mailed in leaks is the receiver:  The
receiver's location(s) and personnel small in number, and easy to put
a mail cover on.  The receiver might counter this by providing mail
drops and couriers (hopefully) unknown to the opposition, which in
cases like Wikileaks would mean reliance on network security to
transmit a one-time destination address to the prospective leaker.
Again, if the network connection is "secure enough" why not just send
the dox that way?
Numerous variations are possible, of course.  I would not consider
either option a categorically superior one in /all/ cases.  When
security really matters, try to do something new and unexpected as
well as sneaky and well protected.

About the time follow up studies measured and confirmed annual summer
methane discharges from thawed out former Arctic permafrost (ancient
peat bogs, tidal flats etc.), climatologists stopped talking about
"stopping" much less reversing global warming.
So far I am not aware of any positive public statements from competent
actors to the effect that global warming is now self-driving
regardless of human activity.  I suspect there is a quiet consensus
that telling this particular truth would do more harm that good:  The
human contribution to global warming does continue to accelerate the
process and enlarge its "final" impact, so statements that could be
taken as excuses to just give up on reducing greenhouse gas emissions
would be counter-productive.
With or without global warming, the exponential growth of human
population and the industrial processes that drive this growth had to
end sometime.  That time is "real soon now."

I so VERY much wish that was true!  I have worked on
'deprogramming' myself since age 17 or 18, with some degree of
success - but only in proportion to the amount of effort expended
X the amount of time spent pushing, pushing, pushing.  Have I
moved off 'square one' yet?  I think so, but sometimes I have my
Early on I arrived at the conclusion that "Knowing better changes
nothing."  Identifying a self defeating mental complex only
indicates a need to start programming its replacements.  Without
effective tools in hand, "knowing better" only leads to denial and
rationalization:  The higher one's verbal IQ and the broader one's
general information, the faster and better defensive self
deception works.
The Zen aphorism "Before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water;
after enlightenment, chop wood, carry water" may apply here.  Even
a fundamental, revolutionary change in perceived personal identity
does not magically flush out a lifetime of beliefs, habits, and
information belonging to some hypothetical "old self" that has
supposedly been overturned.  Enlightenment does not stop the flow
of incoming propaganda, nor does it cancel the established
relationships and dependencies with the external world that define
a person as a social and economic entity.  That thunderous,
world-shattering AHA! moment, if it comes, will at best present a
series of new and more difficult mountains to climb.
Bob Wilson got on that particular bus sometime in the 1960s.  By
the 1980s spreading the gospel of self-deprogramming became his
major mission in life.  I have gotten a lot of mileage out of the
cognitive tools presented here:
Yesterday someone asked me for a "Cliff Notes" version of Wilson's
video Maybe Logic, itself a condensed / introductory gloss of his
written works on self deprogramming.  I had to advise him that
"Cliff Notes" approaches to political and existential problems can
only make them worse...
like to define politics as the process flow of power
relationships in a society.  In this context, blaming systemic
political failures on broken State institutions or malicious
actors wielding State power can not produce practical solutions.
These problems arise mutually; neither can do its nefarious work
without the other, so repairing either allows the other to undo
the repair job - and creates an institutional memory to immunizing
the State against repetition of those repairs.

As well you might:  It appears that Ted has made six posts to the
CPunks list since June of last year.  Each consisted of complaints
about the ideological impurity a.k.a. political incorrectness of
the CPunks list and those who post to it.
Ted and "shakeitoff at ghostmail.com" have a lot in common, including
their vocabulary, grammatical construction, New Left ideology and
a hostile attitude toward what passes for "native culture" on the
CPunks list.  A few posts from years earlier suggest that Ted
probably exists somewhere in meatspace, whereas
shakeitoff at ghostmail.com appears to exist only as a pseudonym
created for a single purpose.
Our morally superior critic shakeitoff at ghostmail.com appeared to
come here to help us eliminate degrading, insulting and hurtful
language on the CPunks list by installing a censorship regime.
But now I see a New Left ideologue providing us with yet another
demonstration that "Those who make and enforce the law are above
the law."
Authoritarian much lately, shakeitoff at ghostmail.com?  No matter:
The CPunks list will not censor you.
Please cite examples of your contributions to the creation,
vetting, promotion, defense of, or end user tech support for "more
code, more crypto."
It would make sense to abandon PC trolling of the CPunks list as a
lost cause.  Most of the participants in the CPunks list self
identify as Anarchist or Libertarian, both of which indicate high
sales resistance to New Left ideology.  You will not beat a crowd
that includes veterans of USENET in open battle.  Uncommitted
third parties do not know or care that the CPunks list exists, so
what potentially receptive audience do you address?
Racist much lately, Ted?  No matter:  The CPunks list will not
censor you.
Several people on the list have taken the issues raised by
shakeitoff at ghostmailseriously enough to discuss them rationally.
"Counterfeit coins exist because there was, first, real gold."
One should always assume good faith on the part of correspondents,
until persuasive evidence indicates otherwise.
But apparently shakeitoff at ghostmail.com and Ted want more:
Committed ideological converts who will trash the CPunks list, an
ongoing and rather successful experiment in free speech, by
installing a shiny new censorship regime.  If "they" can't get
their way, at least they can stamp their little feet and call
people names.

Accoring to Snowden, Greenwald, et al, Snowden has nothing to
trade for asylum:  Everyone in a position to know says that he
gave the whole works to Greenwald & co., to use as he sees fit.
That does not make their assertion true, but as far as I know, no
evidence contradicts it.
Other than Cryptome's blanket warning that /all/ leaked documents
should be treated as disinformation, limited hangouts, etc. until
or unless proven otherwise.
Whether Snowden intended to do that, or was conned into doing so
by his press contacts, remains an open question.
Calling evidence based analysis of the Snowden Affair "conspiracy
theory" does not make it go away.  Least of all, when the audience
understands that propagandists created the Conspiracy Theory meme
for 'name calling' purposes, to stain inconvenient information as
delusional nonsense.
Greenwald converted the Snowden documents from State secrets owned
by the U.S. government, to commercial trade secrets owned by
billionaire Pierre Omidyar.  Their new owners have published a
fraction of those documents for financial profit and, of course,
political propaganda.  I do not expect anything in those documents
that would have an unfavorable impact on billionaires in general
or Omidyar in particular to be published.

At one time I did follow it very closely, so I am sure you will
find plenty to disagree with here:
Neither do I.  Beliefs prejudice perception and judgement.
Because his example has already been followed by others, and more
will follow.  In politics one calls revenge "deterrence," but by
any name the U.S. government wants revenge in this matter.
Greenwald currently resides in Brazil.  Apparently he likes the
climate there better than in the U.S.
Not empty handed, he brought propaganda value with him:  A
no-risk, no-cost chance for Russia to both deprive the U.S. of a
military objective (Snowden's capture) and to play the champion of
justice and fair play on the world stage.  They also obtained an
extended opportunity to determine whether Snowden did have
anything of intelligence value to offer.
Snowden personally leaks nothing; never did, most likely never
will.  By the accounts of all involved parties, Snowden handed off
all copies of all them documents to Greenwald.  Greenwald then
sold the rights to them to Omidyar.  The staff at The Intercept
occasionally take out their eyedropper and deliver one or two of
these documents, along with articles explaining what say and what
they mean to the great unwashed publick.

I have come to view the State as a machine that converts money
into power, and power back into money, in an accelerating feedback
cycle.  This would make 'national security' a mechanism for
defending that machine's operation, and of course, accelerating
the process of delivering money/power into the hands of those who
already have the most of both.
Verily.  The feedback cycle described above, and the industrial
markets that parasitically co-exist with it, must both grow
exponentially to survive.  Since this exponential growth is

access to encrypted data stored on an iPhone is to manually key in
a password on the device itself, that removing a software function
that deletes a stored key hash after n. failed decryption attempts
voids the security of the encrypted data stored on that device,
and that doing this to one iPhone would affect the security of all
iPhone users.

Insubordination is always grounds for dismissal, unless an
employee is ordered to break the law or expose him or herself to
legally banned workplace hazards.  So Apple could handle
non-cooperation problems without involving the Feds:  If we was
Apple, would we want to piss off a client so big that it is a
lucrative market all its own, just to indulge some ungrateful
non-team-player's personal snit fit?  What would Apple board
member Ronald D. Sugar, former chairman and CEO of Northrop
Grumman, say about that?
If Apple receives a Court order or lands a contract that requires
re-purposing staff, they can just hire any skill sets they don't
already have on hand.  If special NDAs or even Federal security
clearances are required, no problem:  If it's a contract matter,
the additional costs are included in the bid; if it's a Court
order, Apple can ask for and most likely receive "reasonable"
compensation for following lawful orders.
"Self destruct?"  It is to laugh.  "Can't work around it?"
These propositions only work if we assume Apple does not have an
in-house capability to analyze, troubleshoot and re-program its
own hardware, does not have the technical capability to read from
the storage media in its own devices, and lacks the engineering
staff and/or data necessary to alter Apple brand software.  In the
case of any such deficiencies, Apple (or the FBI) can hire any
required reverse-engineering done, under NDA (or gag order).
If Apple did not already do whatever was asked of them with regard
to one iPhone formerly owned by one criminal suspect, the FBI can
bring in the NSA on the basis of mere "suspicion" that the case
may have a link to non-U.S. persons.
Instead we get a legal dispute and minor media sideshow based on a
pile of false assertions by /both/ parties, apparently in
collusion, with the apparent intent of creating a legal precedent
for mandatory back doors in U.S. personal electronics - and/or
public demand for legislation to that effect.
The words "Security Theater" come to mind, but with a stronger

"The CIA Campaign To Steal Apple's Secrets"
By Jeremy Scahill and Josh Begley, published in The Intercept:
"These machines have two separate keys integrated into the silicon
of their Apple-designed processors at the point of manufacture.
The two, paired together, are used to encrypt data and software
stored on iPhones and iPads. One, the User ID, is unique to an
individual’s phone, and is not retained by Apple. That key is
vital to protecting an individual’s data and — particularly on
Apple’s latest devices — difficult to steal. A second key, the
Group ID, is known to Apple and is the same across multiple Apple
devices that use the same processor. The GID is used to encrypt
essential system software that runs on Apple’s mobile devices."

The QA department is not responsible to understand how the code

Conversely, whoever designed and implemented the cryptographic
system baked into the Apple hardware in question had /better/ be
aware of how to attack it:  Otherwise, a 3rd party's job when
attempting to break the system is likely to be way too easy.
The same people who made it /do/ need to be able to inspect their

implementation process, and the tools to do so will be familiar to
them.  That makes them just the right folks to ask for advice and

The ability to monitor the supply chain inbound to the machinist,
measure the parts the machinist makes and track them to their

imply the ability to prescribe a specific manufacturing process,
make the part in question, or to evaluate its fitness for use for
a particular purpose.  Those latter functions, and creation of
specifications as acceptance criteria, are jobs for design and
production engineers.
Dozens who want to hire them, worldwide; hundreds who will never
hire them, in their local job market.  Generally speaking,
business owners, executives and managers regard "whistleblowers"
and "refusniks" as proven troublemakers.
A Judge can order just about anyone to do just about anything,

Hmmm... so, a technocratic elite won't be affected, other than
perhaps to the extent of minor inconveniences, when the
exponential growth of industrialization, resource extraction and
human population exceeds geophysical limits?  And this, because
those limits are not real and the only people who will be
adversely affected are those who have incorrect beliefs?
That sounds almost like the narrative of commercialized Conspiracy

that scenario.  The "good vs. evil" issue really is just a matter
of human beliefs, but the laws o' physics part is what most

The division of labor relevant to QA breaks down like this:
Design work is a collaboration between sales/marketing,
engineering staff and (where applicable) customer representatives.
 QA participates by documenting the process and assuring that
relevant facts are clearly communicated between these parties.  QA
does not need to understand the technical details, rather it needs
to assure that people who do understand these details agree that
they are correct per an evidence based process.
Validation work is a collaboration between engineering staff, QA
and customer representatives where applicable, with the sole
objective of assuring that prototypes and first articles of a
product performs as intended.  Again, QA does not need to
understand how the product works, only what it is supposed to do
and whether or not it does that, per the report of other
participants in the process.
Inspection/verification work is a collaboration between
engineering, production and QA staff, with the sole purpose of
assuring that components and systems do not deviate from those
that passed the validation process and were approved for production.
QA is about process:  Communication, documentation, and
facilitating timely and effective remedial action when problems
arise.  QA personnel do not "do" any part of the engineering
process; their whole mission is to facilitate reliable and
effective work by others.

Bingo.  How fast do you want web pages to load, vs. how much do
you want it to cost to de-anonymize your traffic?
In the case of TOR, it has long appeared to me that its leading
design objectives include competing on the speed front with
unprotected networking and VPN services.  The benefits of this
competition include a larger user base = larger anonymity set.
The drawbacks include "the government that pays for TOR also has
the capability to defeat TOR."
Last time I checked, the TOR Browser ships with NoScript turned
off by default, leaving it unprotected against a large family of
side channel attacks.  This choice also looks like a convenience
for technologically naive end users, again degrading the core
security mission for the sake of a larger user base.  In this case
we do know that hostile State actors have used the deficiency to
unmask users, via a honey pot attack exploiting javascript to
phone home and report the users' IP addresses.
Leaving fill traffic on the "to do list" forever, pending the
disappearance of vocal advocates who claim that cover traffic is
not practicable - either "impossible!" or due to a perceived
head-to-head performance contest with unprotected networking -
completes the picture of a State sponsored cryptographic tool
breakable by the State that funds it (but nobody else so far).
I personally consider TOR sufficiently decent to positively lock
out routine commercial surveillance of end users.  Sufficiently
decent to provide reliable protection against NSA assets when
combined with physical OpSec, i.e. covertly using open WiFi
routers and single use disposable computers for brief one-off
sessions.  Sufficiently valuable as an NSA collection asset to
discourage routine harassment or prosecution of TOR users for
petty offenses, which would reveal to more "valuable" targets that
TOR does not protect them.
So far we are only talking about passive attacks by an actor who
can observe both ends of most TOR network connections.  More
costly active attacks could defeat /any/ anonymizing network
protocol based on onion or garlic routing protocols.  So whether
or not to "fix" TOR at the cost of alienating the bulk of its user
base due to performance issues might merit some debate.
My preferred solution:  Defund the the agencies that can and
almost certainly do defeat all current network anonymity
protocols.  My program for accomplishing this objective:  Wait.
They are hell bend on self destruction and Nature will provide.

"Everybody lies." - Greg House
First and foremost we lie to ourselves, continuously, as our
central nervous systems build models of the world based on
incomplete data and unexamined assumptions.  We usually believe
the result of this process is the "real world," because it is the
only world we can experience.  We have to believe, because the
processing overhead of questioning and testing everything, all the
time, would be crippling - and the results would be inconclusive.
But there is a limit to the advantage of taking our illusory
impressions of the real world at face value, and sometimes it does
pay to consciously examine how confident we are of a source of
information, why we have that confidence, and how these factors
should affect own conclusions about that information.  What
evidence do we really have, where did it come from and how can it
be tested?
When our available information is second hand, ambiguous and/or
self contradictory, and especially when it originates in a context
of human conflict, there may be no rational basis for confident
conclusions about what really happened:  Just a cluster of
possible interpretations which can be assigned higher or lower
probability on a basis of educated guesswork about the quality of
the sources and how the information itself fits - or does not fit
- - into what we already 'know' about its native context.
People who do this for a living are called intelligence analysts,
and their training includes all of the above.  When the going gets
spooky, the spooks his the books.  Highly recommended for anyone
who takes an interest in news and current events:
Subjective human experience is the instrument that detects and
represents "reality," so it pays to have a handle on how that
system works.  I doubt that the CIA requires trainees to read and
study this textbook, but it wouldn't hurt if they did:

I was very disappointed that the book in question has all the
earmarks of partisan disinformation in and of itself.  The
networked communication revolution has greatly reduced the
usefulness of censorship and secrecy, and disinformation campaigns
have grown dramatically to compensate for this development. We do
need a better understanding and wider public recognition of the
theory, applications and history of black propaganda and
disinformation, if we want to avoid and counter this form of
In social media venues where populist and/or radical political
interests are prominently represented, black propaganda in support
of State and corporate interests is rampant.  Ideological converts
who promote, defend and embellish disinformation narratives
supplied by front groups dominate many discussions.  These
campaigns do more than poison wells where factual information
suppressed in broadcast media is available.  They also damage the
image and dilute the message of populist and activist groups in
real life, by seeding their organizational meetings and public
events with ideological converts who vocally advocate for
delusional beliefs and self defeating methods.
Using black propaganda and front groups to co-opt, discredit and
neutralize populist and radical movements is an old and well
established feature of political warfare.  Adapting this strategy
to the Internet environment requires new tactics, and presents new
opportunities.  Activist groups targeted for marginalization,
division and termination by well funded adversaries need to adapt
their own techniques to counter new threats and exploit new
opportunities presented by their opponents in the network
Disinformation has inherent advantages over real information:  It
can be designed from the ground up for simplicity, emotional
appeal and behavioral impact.  Against this, truth has the
advantages of internal consistency, relevance, and appeal to a
more intelligent audience - so, when truth is attacked by
disinformation operators, it needs all the help it can get to
stand even a slight chance of propagating and affecting human
behavior in the real world.

Quite so. "Democracy" was an early casualty of the Industrial
Revolution, which concentrated unprecedented wealth and power in
the hands of industrialists.  In the United States, the issue of
collective rule by land owners vs. collective rule by factory
owners was decided by the Civil War.  Today "democracy" normally
means "deniable subversion and control by a ruling oligarchy."
Not to mention future shock.  Big decisions made today, if they
can not be implemented by next Tuesday, are likely to be
implemented in a world where their relevance is limited at best -
if they can be implemented at all.  The future itself is
recognized as an adversary by those whose interests are best
served by maintaining established power structures.
Wait, what?  I would question the possibility that 'elites' can
make any decisions in the direction of mass liberty.  If an elite
class exists, its collective interest lies in increasing the
liberties available to the elite class, at the expense of everyone
else's liberties.
Ideally the lower classes should have the 'liberty' to choose
options from a menu presented to them by their betters.  This
softens the blow of a policy regime where "everything that is not
mandatory is prohibited."  Should one faction of an elite class
appear to advocate for 'popular liberty,' they are doing so in an
effort to shift market dynamics to favor their own enterprises, at
the expense of other elite factions that will oppose any such
Of course they weighed the issues.  Doing so enables an elite
class to use its power today, to remain an elite class tomorrow.
At the outset of the Internet's exponential growth, America's
captains of corporate industry contracted their strategic advisers
- - think tanks, intelligence services, market researchers,
propaganda shops - to determine what policies and practices would
best serve their interests in the emerging Information Age.
Informed by the openly published analyses and strategic plans of
social and political activists on the early Internet (i.e. the
WELL community's 'electronic democracy' advocates), these advisers
reported that the Internet would destabilize social and political
power structures in unprecedented ways, shifting power away from
the few toward the many - much as the printing press had in an
earlier age, but on a larger scale with more immediate, agile and
adaptive impact.
Proposed solutions included mitigating the worst impacts of the
Internet on established power by making it a surveillance
platform, with unprecedented scope and depth of penetration into
the everyday lives of whole populations.  This would facilitate
faster, more effective tactical, policy and propaganda responses
to the emergence of populist power centers on the network,
partially mitigating the Internet's undesirable impacts.  So,
along with a major shift toward authoritarian governance,
consolidated broadcast propaganda platforms and accelerated
redistribution of wealth (= power) upward in the social hierarchy,
a comprehensive State and corporate surveillance regimen was
facilitated by the "open" and inherently insecure nature of its
protocols and implementations.
Early 'netizens' understood the potential of the Internet as a
force multiplier for populist political actors, and they knew that
established power blocks with a common vested interest in the
status quo would fight back.  They redoubled their efforts to
develop, refine and propagate strategies and tactics for Internet
enabled populist political action.  Technologists sympathetic to
these efforts started developing practical countermeasures to
Internet surveillance and censorship, and the rest is Cypherpunk
The meaning of "security" depends very much on context:  Whose
security, against what hostile actors?  Technologists with an
Anarchist, Libertarian or other populist political orientation
view "insecure" network protocols, software and hardware as
problems to be solved.  Political warfare assets employed by
military, law enforcement and corporate actors would call these
same features strategic and tactical assets, enabling them to
enhance the security of their employers against hostile and/or
destabilizing influences.
Occasionally, anti-security in the network infrastructure will
turn around and bite its authors in the ass - comprehensive
Chinese penetration of U.S. military contractors and the OMB
personnel records fiasco will probably stand as classic examples
for quite a while.  But occasional victories by one's adversaries
is a cost of doing business in any war, including information
warfare against one's own restive and unruly populace.  Lessons
are learned, tactics are adjusted, and the information warriors
move on to the next battle front.
We shall have a "more secure Internet" going forward.  But as long
as we do have a ruling class, we shall not have a "secure
Internet" except at the scale of darknet operations that, as their
name implies, are as secure against wide public participation as
they are against State and corporate surveillance.
I do hope the IETF and IT industries proves me at least partially
wrong, by implementing the objectives outlined in RFC 6973.  But I
believe nothing of this sort can be implemented until or unless
sufficient technical countermeasures to enable State and corporate
actors to proceed with mass surveillance and censorship as usual
are available.
Another security issue overshadows all of the above:  The role of
disinformation operations that attack the network's end users via
weaponized social psychology.  But that's a whole 'nother topic.

I haven't been around here long enough to dare presume to speak on
behalf of the cpunks list regs, but it was my impression that the

believe it reads "Fuck you, I do what I want."  Not sure of the
exact wording but it's something to that effect IIRC.
It seems to be working OK here so far.  Ain't broke, don't fix it.
 If you don't like it, go elsewhere; anarchy ain't for everybody.
In re FLOSS development and its social infrastructure:
In any healthy and productive engineering shop, physical or
virtual, outside observers who assume that a primate pecking order
defines and governs /all/ human social roles and behaviors may be
forgiven for seeing a "meritocracy" where none exists.  In a
healthy, productive engineering shop, anyone who contributes to
the practical objectives of the project is valued as a team member
and encouraged to continue doing so.  Those who are in a position
to make large and highly visible contributions may thereby become
"popular" but this does not confer authority on them, and is not
an obstacle to anyone else's contributions.
Of course there are dysfunctional engineering shops, commercial
and non-commercial.  Introducing policies requiring the
participants in a toxic work environment promise to play nice, and
promise to punish those who do not, would only compound existing
abuses of power by adding a fresh layer of passive aggressive
posturing and manipulation.

The controversial post that started this discussion directly
quotes the key messaging of current campaigns for the restraint of
speech and enforcement of racial and gender quotas, especially
targeting college campuses - now also targeting collaborative
software development projects, their mailing lists and even CPunks.
Does this phenomenon represent spontaneous demands for justice
arising from the awakening social conscience of Amerika's best and
brightest, or a black propaganda campaign working to drive wedges
between dissident factions and demographics?  I do not think it
matters.  I think the functional consequences of that campaign and
the response it elicits do matter.
Crypto-Anarchy has an inherent agenda of enabling populist
political resistance, organization and uprisings.  To whatever
extent this agenda could find applications in real life, it merits
hostile attention from State sponsored actors.  Depicting the
CPunk and Hacker communities as gangs of racist misogynists, and
prodding them in ways designed to provoke open mockery of any such
concerns, makes strategic sense in this context.
It always pays to outclass the opposition, in word /and/ deed.

"Obsessive avoidance of Internet surveillance does not take you off
the radar, it only takes you out of the game." - Me
When it comes to the "chilling effects" of State surveillance,
everybody who subscribes to CPunks is a member of a certain type of
Polar Bear Club.  Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.
I use GMail accounts as spam filters, i.e. destination addresses for
contact forms on websites, and as logins for G-Everything services
like Google Analytics.
Google Analytics does make it "easier" for Google's best friend, tech
support department and business partner NSA to keep track of who is
visiting the websites in question, but the trade-off in utility for
yrs. truly & clients more than justifies that.  Anybody who wants a
lower profile on the networks already blocks execution of javascript
except from whitelisted domains, and blocks calls from their browsers
to any URL with the string "analytics" in its URL.
I did register a domain name and hire a hosting service /just/ so I
could have real e-mail accounts, more or less under my own control.  I
did this for convenience, not any belief that it presents a barrier to
State surveillance.
On a related note, something truly horrible:  I have an active account
with NSA subsidiary The Facebook.  Initially I set it up to test
"social network integration" features when making websites:  You can't
market to the rubes in the cheap seats unless you can see the Internet
through their piggy little eyes.  Eventually I decided "what the hell"
and started pumping out propaganda there.  This led directly to
physical participation in the local activist & radical scene.
Given that my network traffic has been flagged for full take and
permanent retention by every U.S. intelligence service capable of same
since such capabilities first became available, I am sure that my
presence on The Facebook does more harm to them and their interests
than it does to me and my interests.  State surveillance at least
guarantees one an audience.

I have long considered this a minor but common cognitive error:  It

suggestion:  When you do drugs, don't drink and drive.
That's on the record via a non-Snowden leak of NSA filter rules

But obsessive avoidance of surveillance takes one out of the game of
propaganda and networking for IRL political actions.  It also limits
one's ability to monitor opposition propaganda and team building
efforts.  That's a big win for the opposition:  The so-called chilling
effect of mass surveillance that makes Liberals run and hide while the
Radicals laugh and high five each other.
It is also beneficial to use evasive tools and tactics on a regular

current on the state of those arts, and so that occasional use of such
tools for practical purposes will not stand out as red flag indicators

In the sense that "legal" means compliant with orders imposed by the
the State, "legal secession" is a logical absurdity:  One does not
gain immunity from a sovereign State's enforcement powers by
submitting to them, nor independence by obeying its dictates.
If the Sovereign stops being a Sovereign by abandoning the enforcement
powers that define State sovereignty, that's different - but the order
to "do your own thing" remains just a noise.
Word games:  To the extent that they control people's minds, they can
be even more "real" than physical bullets, bars and chains - because
they control the application of these physical tools.

A couple of years ago, Forbes reported that 400 billionaires owned 1/2
the capital assets in the U.S.
In the face of this, I think AP may have a problem with scale:  How
many small investors does it take to redirect AP profiteers away from
targets chosen by factions among the ruling class, beginning with
anyone suspected of operating the AP infrastructure and/or promoting
it effectively to a wide audience of participants?
If an AP lottery is not "fair and honest" by allowing anyone to be
targeted regardless of occupation or etc., how long until ones that do
allow any human to be bet on appear, with inflated bounties on
perceived enemies of the ruling class?
Mind you, AP is a frightfully clever idea.

My own view is that the sole function of the State it to convert money
into power, then back into money.  Partial reinvestment of State
partons' capital gains produces an accelerating feedback cycle,
concentrating more money (=power) into fewer hands over time.  I don't
anticipate this changing as corporations become more sovereign and
States less so.
I think that's a matter of perspective.  Some of "poorest of the poor"
have seen rising incomes, while the "middle class" in many
industrialized jurisdictions has been taking a beating.  But the
billionaires, "statistically insignificant" in terms of head count,
continue to dominate political activity due to the massive extent of
income and assets inequality that appears at the very top of the scale.
A couple of graphs based on U.S. statistics:
  (a real classic)
- - or -
  (less extreme-looking aggregate numbers)
This raises the issue of implementation.  In the case at hand,
counter-anonymity is a question of money:  How much money do you have,
how badly do you want to prevent anonymous transactions?  Remailers,
onion and garlic routing, etc. are at present only somewhat resistant
to an adversary who can observe much of the network, most of the time.
 I envision a briefing where a select group of U.S. billionaires and
telco CEOs learn about AP and are told, "We must spend x trillion
dollars over the next decade to keep this from happening."  Rinse and
repeat in other national and corporate jurisdictions.  Ouch.
I believe that this advantage should be sufficient, given prevailing
conditions as illustrated by the L-Curve graph mentioned above, and
the imperfect nature of anonymity technologies available or envisioned
today.  The absurd spike at the top of the income scale gives a
handful of individuals enormously disproportionate power, and they aim
to keep it.
I think that should be preceded with, "If successful."  Funding a
global, directly democratic freelance mercenary force targeting
"abusers of" power would not produce a post-AP world overnight.
Exhausting the defensive and counter-offensive resources of today's
ruling class would take time.  Assuring that assets pass intact from
deceased owners to their heirs and assignees is already a core
function of the State, so killing individual billionaires might
introduce turbulence but would not remove the problem of "minority
rule by violent means."  I think it would be likely to lead to wide
scale ultra-violent responses.
I have my doubts.  The cost of overcoming the defences of a President
would be astronomically higher than the costs and risks of overcoming
the defences of, for instance, an independent journalist.  This would
mandate a much higher bounty on the former.  Conversely, public demand
for removing an unpopular President would also be proportionally
higher - a mitigating factor.  Conversely x2, that President's backers
might consider certain journalists worth paying over-market prices to
remove, as her efforts might eventually aim the AP process at them
It seems to me that replacing an unjust and inequitable system of
governance enforced by the threat of murder, with a more just and fair
system of governance enforced by murder would not produce results that
most would consider ethical.  Not to say that, if successfully
implemented as envisioned, it would necessarily be worse than what we
have today.
A "Court" is a forum governed by a sovereign authority, where
petitions and arguments are heard and decisions on the application of
sovereign authority are made.  A Court whose sole function is to
authorize murder could dispense revenge, but never justice:  Every
sovereign in every war throughout history has presented its casus
belli as the defense of human life, and the fact that war is tolerated
by enough people to make it possible demonstrates that application of
a "non-aggression principle" in conjunction with decisions to hire and
direct murderers can not be entrusted to either sovereigns or a
peasant rabble.
Ever since the appearance of hierarchical societies with capital
assets to defend, assassination markets of a sort, e.g. military and
police activities, have been the bedrock of political and economic
systems.  The anonymity element has traditionally been partial and
figurative - decisions to commit State sanctioned murder are "nothing
personal" in the sense that they are supported by consensus across
committees and syndicates, automated to the fullest extent possible
(law, policy, due process), and paid for by small payments from large
numbers of peasants who have been persuaded to tolerate murder for
hire "for the greater good."  Those who do the actual killing are
absolved of liability because they are "faceless cogs in the machne"
only following orders.  The AP model radically streamlines and
democratizes, but does not remove, today's process of controlling
people via murder "for the greater good of the greater number."
If the practical barriers to its implementation could be overcome, AP
might be an improvement over present methods.  Revenge is not justice,
but unlike justice it can at least be played as a formal game.  AP
markets would eventually provide great entertainment, in the form of
assassin vs. assassin contests triggered by contentious "hits."
Crowdfunding contract killers to identify and kill other contract
killers could evolve into a full replacement for today's professional
athletic amusements.
The seeds were everywhere.  Lots of twistid visionaries saw
assassination markets coming, though none worked out the details to
make it (nearly) practicable - that was waiting on applicable
- From Subvert Comix  by Spain Rodriguez, 1976:
But again, the devil is in the details:  Thus far it looks to me like
the twin problems of anonymity that is not reliably anonymous, and the
vast scale of financial resources presently controlled by the segments
of the population who are AP's likeliest targets, are outstanding
problems complicating AP's implementation.
Back in 1984 I was interviewed by a non-human intelligence, who
briefly explained why it was self evidently necessary to remove 90% of
the Earth's human population and asked for authorization to proceed.
I could not fault his case, but I did impose a condition on my
acceptance of his offer:  Proceed only if everyone faces an equal
chance of removal - no favoritism or exemptions of any kind allowed.
Apparently a compliant solution is taking quite a long time to
implement.  But as and when it is, many of the problems AP would
combat would be greatly reduced, as would the practical barriers to
AP's implementation.
Although a "better future" was not promised or even implied, I am
cautiously optimistic...

I call these "Network Security Axioms."  You will recognize most of
them, I am sure.  A couple are originals.
Everything is under control; your control or someone else's.
A trusted system is one that can break your security model.
A hardened perimeter is easily broken; a hardened system, not so much.
The laws of nations are easily broken; the laws of physics, not so much.
In God we trust, all others provide full source code for peer review.
Given enough observers, all bugs are shallow.
To make a system stronger, attack it.
Physical access can compromise any network security model.
A failed data backup may cost more than a successful break-in.
An unexamined assumption is a ticking time bomb.
User refusal is the principal barrier to secure networking.

I have myself been declared a motherfucker by Juan's executive fiat,
though not if I recall correctly a Statist Pig.  Perhaps this post will
rectify that deficiency.  Only time will tell.
Not everyone seems to be in agreement about how horrible ioerror is.
His defenders include at least one individual who isn't afraid of
disclosing information that she knows sounds "paranoid," in the process
of disclosing her take on Jake.
The absence of any legal proceedings, criminal or civil, seems rather a
big data point.  Lots of people are willing to throw stones, nobody is
willing to face a potential perjury charge or countersuit.  Maybe nobody
was actually harmed, beyond hurt feelings.
Any male geek person with Our Mr. Applebaum's "celebrity" status who is
also (in my heteronormative radical queer opinion) good looking, is very
likely to avail himself of the sexual perquisites of social prestige.
If that is the case with Our Mr. Applebaum, it would inevitably result
in at least /some/ hurt feelings, even if he was a perfect fucking
knight in shining armor - which he probably ain't, because who is?
Pardon my macroaggression, but there is a very current Identity Politics
fad for cutting all Male Pigs down to size, and its fan base demographic
intersects with the fan base of everything that even looks "radical and
culturally cutting edge" to a fuzzy studies major, including the TOR
Project.  In this social matrix, acts of simple careless idiocy, devoid
of malice and producing no real harm, could lead to all of the charges
we have seen.
If you are of a paranoid bent, ask whether a political warfare operation
could produce the exact results seen in Our Mr. Applebaum's recent
history.  Seeking out unsatisfied customers of Brand Jake who are
associated with evangelists for Feminazi fashion would be a snap:
Thanks to ubiquitous surveillance with automated social network mapping
and psychographic classification, finding people matching the desired
profile and history would only require a work order.  Develop one agent
- witting or not - and the rest handles itself.  (If, and please pardon
the expression, Our Mr. Applebaum has exposed himself in any way.)
Of course, this kind of thing is unheard of.  Unless the name Mendax
means anything to you.
It is possible that Our Mr. Applebaum is a raging asshole who routinely
mistreats women in serious ways.  But if so, the lack of any criminal
charges or civil action is surprising.
It is possible that he is a victim of spontaneous combustion comparable
to the Mean Girls on the cheerleading squad getting some amusing
revenge, motivated by nothing more serious than some naive sap's
socially awkward behavior.  That model fits the available evidence
better than the criminal model.
It is highly probable that IF a political warfare activity was asked to
arrange this party for Our Mr. Applebaum, they could quote a very
reasonable price and deliver the goods on time.  The beauty part:  By
itself this observation proves nothing, as it is difficult or impossible
to prove absent a credible inside source.  That's the beauty part of the
institution of State Secrecy.

I think I already did that?
Looking at the motives and means of people who have opportunities is
usually very relevant in determining who did what and why.  Of course,
that might be inconvenient for anyone who comes in with a preconceived
notion that explains it all.
What I see here is an assumption that the TOR Project itself, or some
element thereof, would be the actor behind any effort to kick Our Mr.
Applebaum out of the project and "activist" communities in general,
via a reputation attack.  I would not rule that out, but I would
include the whole alphabet soup of TLAs on the list of potential

State Department (funding TOR as a vector for transmitting State
propaganda to foreign audiences), CIA (a love/hate relationship with
TOR; helps some missions, hinders others), the FBI (we hates all nasty
TORses, hates them we does), and God knows who else.
If the TOR Project ever manages to well and truly piss the State
Department off that would mean Big Trouble: Including maybe a huge
shake-up like we are seeing now?  Just closing it down by pulling the
funding would probably not be an option, as that would massively
complicate lots of political warfare projects in progress against
"regimes" targeted for disposal.  The incoming President wouldn't like
that, and we know what happens to people who do things she doesn't like.
Now yer just being silly.  A project like taking Applebaum down could
be paid for out of petty cash and/or by raiding the office coffee fund.

The mission defined above is much more ambitious than it may initially
appear, because direct conflicts of interest are hard wired into it.
The "cybersecurity" buzzword embraces a spectrum of practical security
context from protecting consumer financial credentials through
shielding "secret" government databases from unauthorized access, to
preventing malicious alteration of the firmware that runs our civil
and industrial infrastructure.  Privacy is not encompassed by the term
"cybersecurity" as it is intended and understood by those who use
presently use it in a national policy context - but this can and
should change.
Network security addresses practical concerns of privacy, utility,
reliability and cost effectiveness as well as countermeasures to
stereotypical hacker threats.  The express inclusion of privacy
protection in its brief directs the Commission to deliver
recommendations directly counter to the interests of private
enterprises and government departments which presently collect,
analyze, and transfer or act on "private" information about
individuals and groups.  If economic security is taken to include
protecting the revenue streams of dominant U.S. IT vendors and their
associated armies of specialized workers in the field, either
"cybersecurity" or economic security must be sacrificed.  If national
security is taken to include protecting intelligence service access to
surveillance and sabotage targets via widely distributed security
defects in IT products and services, either "cybersecurity" or
national security must be sacrificed.
A security model can not be "just a little bit pregnant."  Every
variance or exception that permits violations of any system's
specified security protocol creates new vulnerabilities that
compromise the security of that system, usually in subtle as well as
obvious ways. Security threats are both external and internal to the
enterprise, and include hackers who want to break in for fun and/or
profit, but also:  Enterprise IT consumers who who make non-negotiable
demands for features and functions that create security
vulnerabilities; senior executives whose golfing buddies know more
about network security than the enterprise's entire IT staff; IT
vendors who are free to hide deficiencies and misrepresent their wares
under immunity from prosecution or civil liability; academics and
consultants whose personal fortunes rise and fall with the value of
vendor-specific credentials; and certified technical workforces whose
educational and occupational background is restricted to a vendor
specific context, and includes mandatory training as outside sales
reps for those same vendors.  Add to this the massive political
influence of dominant U.S. IT vendors' senior executives and major
shareholders, and our picture of an industry hard wired for security
failure is complete.  The expected end result of the complex of
counter-security factors outlined above would be smoking rubble, and
that is and apt description of prevailing network security conditions.
Pervasive "cybersecurity" failures have prompted the Executive branch
to prepare for intervention across both government and private sector
domains; in itself this is evidence that a deep systemic disorder
harmful to the National Interest has been recognized and acknowledged.
 Developing a functional model that explains why an emergency exists
is the first step toward reliably and durably ending it.  The
inclusive nature of the Commission's mandate requires it to address
"cybersecurity" in a holistic manner.  The systemic disorders listed
above are inherent in the present economic and political relationships
of parties whose inputs control IT security across all domains.
Effective solutions will be called "radical" and rightly so, as one
must change the underlying economic and political relationships that
drive the ongoing failure of "cybersecurity" to achieve meaningful
results.  Bolting layers of external reinforcement onto a broken
machine does not fix the machine, only prolongs its ability to produce
broken outputs.  Like an urban renewal project, implementing an
effective national "cybersecurity" strategy begins with a wrecking
ball.  If this is not an acceptable option, "enhanced cybersecurity"
is not a possible outcome.
In the present context, trust has two distinct and nearly opposite
definitions:  In a political context, trust means confidence
cultivated to further a collaborative and/or manipulative agenda.  In
a network security context, trust is a controlled asset whose role is
minimized on every front and excluded where and as possible:  A
trusted actor or system is one that can break your security model.
A competent IT security strategy compartmentalizes, simplifies and
hardens the handling of protected assets.  Tools must be selected and
protocols designed on a case by case basis to enable a given
enterprise or department's necessary functions while minimizing
exposure of its assets to hostile actors.  Trust is rationed, and
dispensed only where and as the benefits of trust outweigh the risks.
As a simple example illustrating the role of trust in "cybersecurity,"
all major web browsers automatically download and execute software as
directed by any website their users visit, without the user's
knowledge or express consent.  Large families of critical security
vulnerabilities grow from this promiscuous trust model.  Many botnets
propagate themselves via this vector, which has also enabled targeted
attacks compromising "secured" assets affecting major corporations and
government agencies.  Browser makers build automatic execution of 3rd
party software into their browsers because both end users and major
commercial website operators demand it.  Vendor efforts to mitigate
this critical security threat by 'sanitizing and sandboxing' incoming
executable code can reduce but not reliably prevent high impact
security incidents arising from a fundamentally insecure trust model.
Informed end users can install tools like NoScript which prevent the
browser from downloading and executing software without the user's
express consent.  Individual websites can be whitelisted by the user,
where and as the benefits of automatically executing arbitrary
software from a given site are believed to outweigh the risks of doing
so.  In practice this trivially simple trust based security measure
has proven itself orders of magnitude more effective than a
promiscuous trust model "mitigated" by complex, failure prone defenses
against hostile code.
Bridging the trust gap between the IT community and the US government
is already a done deal, because there has never been one.  The U.S.
government funded and directed the creation of the IT industry.  As
indicated above, the existing bridges enabling public/private
partnership in IT enterprises create promiscuous trust relationships
in the face of conflicts of interest, perverse incentives and
institutional inertia all working against the objectives of
"cybersecurity."  Rather than reinforcing them, these bridges must be
locked down or removed as the first step toward enhancing
The U.S. government has not alienated the IT community:  It has
shielded this community from liability for fraudulent performance
claims, fed it billions of dollars of annual revenue, and given
Fortune 500 IT corporations nearly full control of government policy
affecting those same corporations.  The intimate partnership of IT
vendors and government decision makers has, however, alienated a large
segment of the public at large.  With regard to privacy concerns, IT
vendors are correctly perceived as the government's partners in
domestic mass surveillance.  The interests of the IT community are
directly served by the government's nearly absolute tolerance for
commercial mass surveillance, inherently insecure products and
protocols, forced obsolescence strategies and abusive marketing
practices - all of which are routinely implemented by major IT vendors
to reduce costs and/or enhance revenues.
The current condition of gross insecurity across private and State
owned IT assets is a product of the dominant role of vendors who are
richly rewarded for exploiting the technological ignorance of private
and public sector decision makers.  The cumulative cost of unstable,
insecure IT infrastructure supplied and serviced by parasitic vendors
greatly exceeds the short term costs of replacement with stable,
security oriented infrastructure; but perverse incentives and
conflicts of interest assure that no such course can be taken absent
dynamic and determined public sector leadership.
Revoke software vendors' blanket immunity from prosecution for
consumer fraud and from liability for damage caused by failure to
control product defects.  Where there is no accountability, there is
no motivation to spend money on security and no rational basis for
consumer trust.  The infallible invisible hand of the Free Market can
not produce security, quality or innovation where the State grants
special immunity from prosecution and civil liability to privileged
Mandate security evaluations based on performance and design metrics
for all software (and firmware) purchased for use by government
agencies and departments.  These evaluations must include examination
of the specific product offerings under consideration, and the
bidder's historical security track record across all products.  Total
cost of ownership calculations for IT assets must include estimated
costs of potential security failures, and projected costs of recovery
from same, proportionally adjusted to reflect the relative security
performance of each competing bidder's products.  This could be
facilitated by the establishment of a transparent, accountable Federal
activity that collects relevant data and produces reports in a
standardized format consistent with government procurement process.
Mandate reporting of security incidents by every government activity,
and every commercial enterprise with a State or Federal tax ID, where
financial losses and costs of remediation and recovery from the
incident exceed $5,000.00.  Require reporting of the category of
failure, specific software tools that presented the vulnerabilities
exploited, direct losses incurred, and the costs of remedial and
recovery measures taken.  Specify that aggregate data from these
reports be made available to the public on at least a quarterly basis.
Direct the Federal Communication Commission to conduct and annually
review studies on the privacy impacts, positive and negative, of
deployed and proposed network communication protocols and Standards,
publicly report their findings, and solicit public comments in a
transparent process.  Mandate that all reports reference IETF RFC
6973, Privacy Considerations, as guidance in identifying, naming and
evaluating adverse and beneficial privacy impacts of deployed and
proposed network communication protocols and architectures.
See above.  A durable commitment of all necessary resources to assure
that the measures suggested in response to query 2 are effectively
implemented would create and sustain rational, constrained trust
relationships affecting all those aspects of "cybersecurity" which are
properly the government's business.
The requirement that recommendations be "realistic" is regrettable.
"Practicable" would have been better language.  A realistic proposal
might be considered as one that will not provoke a do-or-die defense
of the status quo from dominant IT vendors, U.S. intelligence
activities, and others whose bread and butter is "cyber insecurity."
A practicable proposal would be one that is within the scope of public
policy authorities and industry capabilities:  Vendors who assert that
requirements are "impossible" or simply refuse to comply will be
replaced by vendors who are ready to step forward and meet any
challenges presented.  Solutions to many of today's most serious and
widespread network security failures are already avaialbe as off the
shelf products from vendors with excellent security track records.
The proposals presented under query 3 above may not be considered
reasonable by dominant industry stakeholders, but they are
practicable, and these or materially similar policy initiatives are
necessary if the President is serious about getting the results he has
asked for.

I can dig it.  But how to implement this?  My strategy is to let
Nature take its course; after the State collapses, surviving resources
no longer under State control will be up for grabs.
BTW, money as we know it is a fiction created and maintained by the
State for the purpose of enriching the powerful at everyone else's
expense.  See how easy it is to fall into the trap of compliance with
State sponsored assumpitons?  :)
Note that this would only affect the State itself, and those who have
made a positive commitment to submit to State dominion.
This ain't a call for regulation; it's just a call for public
reporting by a State agency.  ;)
Only if I expect this to produce real world results.  Prescribing
abstinence as a cure for alcoholism, or getting well as a cancer cure,
would be similar in effect.
For a start, if my (impossible) suggestions were implemented,
Microsoft would lose its most important State protections, all its
government contracts, and a large part of its market share in the
business and consumer markets.  Those product lines would be largely
replaced by UNIX model operating systems, Free software applications,
My first draft was an explicit Microsoft death sentence, I worked
backward from there to create generic, vendor agnostic conditions that
would assure the same result.
No anarchists were harmed in the production of this policy brief.  I
wrote it because it amuses me to keep a hand in - I used to do quality
assurance programs and the like, and sometimes I miss the games.  Also
to troll the Commission.

I know of a couple of small businesses still running core missions on
Windows 98; in their use cases it "just works" and they see no need to
fix it.  There are still millions of XP installations grinding away
out there.  When a tool has successfully supported necessary business
process for years, rational managers don't replace it until it either
breaks or something comes along that offers a real improvement in the
performance of the enterprise as a whole.  Hence the key roles of
forced obsolescence, managed security failure, and product
misrepresentation in the wonderful world of proprietary software.
Post-apocalypse, Free Software will dominate because of its superior
performance in the context of salvaging and repurposing hardware, and
because it already has a distributed architecture in place for
developing and maintaining software.
The more Free Software we have in our large scale integrated
infrastructure today, the faster and better we can stand up a
patchwork quilt of autonomous infrastructures tomorrow.

Can't say that I see much value in toys created for the purpose of
reinforcing the brand loyalty of Sheeple 2.0 with regard to whatever
Identity Politics trap they have fallen into.  Of course if you /want/
to deploy a stupidity amplifier, anything that constantly reminds a
True Believer that he or she is better than other people will do the
trick.  Does your bright idea help mutually alienate people who might
otherwise band together to promote their common interests at the
expense of their rulers?  Apply for a grant!
Identity politics works by conditioning people to pin their self
esteem on the inherent superiority of their racial, language,
national, economic, social and/or political in-group.  Strict
compliance with the pseudo-gang's rigid stereotypical beliefs and
behaviors makes the faithful Somebodies, and prevents them from
associating with hated Others.
Like all effective propaganda platforms, identity politics formalizes
and exploits a pre-existing human weakness, in this case the so-called
herd instinct.  Identity politics is maintained and advanced through
strategy that consistently scapegoats and demonizes targeted Others
and, to a lesser extent, anyone else who fails to hear and obey the
correct Party Line.  Logic, reason and practicality are off the table,
although simulating these to provide "proofs" of what Believers
already believe is an important part of the complete and balanced
propaganda breakfast.  It's easy, because all issues are reduced to
binary us versus them issues.  The more valid an evidence based
criticism of any article of faith, the more desperately the true
believer clutches for straws:  It doesn't take much to "rescue" them
from wrong thinking.
Otherwise sane and rational people become easily led animals when they
fall under the spell of identity politics; a high IQ only means
superior internal resources for rationalizing ignorant beliefs.
That's where Knee Jerk Reactionary Republicans, Yellow Dog Democrats
and other packaged personlike Product comes from, and how segmented
markets are herded into battles that assure a populace so divided
against itself that its rulers have a free hand to do whatever they
want unopposed, except by easily marginalized outliers and minorities.
Funny thing:  Lots of readers will agree with the above assessment,
because it applies to ignorant easily led Other People, proving that
their own identity group is better.

It seems to me that high capacity routers would take a performance hit
from the number crunching and caching requirements of semi-anonymizing
all network traffic.  A proposal to redo the whole Internet in some
such protocol would be hard to sell.  People who "want" some measure
of privacy are willing to make cost and performance trade-offs
proportional to their motivation; but bulk data carriers and large
hosting providers are more interested in shaving fractional pennies
off data transactions than in end user privacy.
How much of the network can an adversary see, vs. how big a
performance hit do you need to take to reduce your profile?  Dummy
traffic makes matching the ends of a hidden path orders of magnitude
harder, so the numbers crunched and bandwidth consumed might be an
overall performance tradeoff win.

Anonymized routing protocols are designed to defeat passive

what if an effectively unlimited number of compromised routers,
subject to realtime observation and internal manipulation, were
available to hostile actors?  Game over, I think.
About 15 years ago I used online traceroute utilities and whois
lookups to determine (roughly) where all the high performing Mixmaster
remailers were physically located.  Over half of them, including most
with "exotic sounding" TLDs, were apparently in the state of Texas.
Then I used my data to construct "hard to compromise" chains, routing
Mixmaster messages through national jurisdictions not likely to have
comprehensive data sharing between their security services, and
started sending test messages.  None of these test messages ever made
it back to me.
So I concluded that, despite its major technical superiority to other
anonymized networking protocols, the Mixmaster network was most likely
compromised by passive observation (one owner for a majority of
reliable remailers) and active intervention (traffic between
uncontrolled remailers interrupted in transit).
Owning enough of the routers in an anonymizing network to negate its
security is largely a question of money:  How much budget to you have,
how certain do you want to be that nobody is really anonymous?
If I had to neutralize an anonymous routing network, my approach would
be to set up a cloud server running thousands of instances of the
router software in question, customized to facilitate monitoring by a
hypervisor.  Each of these routers would be connected via VPN to a
unique remote host, which would function as a transparent proxy.  The
proxy hosts could be machines owned by "friendly" actors, rooted
consumer grade routers, purpose built appliances, conventional Windows
botnets or some combination of these.
I have not seen this method of attack described and named; I call it a
"hydra" attack, because one body, many heads.  I think this mode of
attack deserves competent attention (i.e., not by me) because realtime
observation and manipulation of any desired quantity of routers would
provide solutions to any distributed anonymous routing protocol.
The only defence I can think of is to assure that message traffic
passes back and forth between mutually hostile national jurisdictions
before delivery.  This would be a bit of a hairball to implement, lots
of slippery variables and potential counter-actions by hostiles would

cost and reduce the reliability of Hydra attacks against anonymizing

Anyone who is visible on the Internet for any substantial length of

"watchdogs" regardless of anything said or done in real life.  Widely
broadcast accusations backed by no verifiable independent sources only

Attila the Hun.  To those who "know" that TOR is the bestest weapon in
the whole Freedom Fighter arsenal, he is the noblest of heroes.  Both
views are dead wrong.  Whether TOR is harmful or helpful depends
entirely on how well its users understand both what it does, and what
their potential adversaries can do about it.
Since the Five Eyes & aligned regimes can easily afford to literally
own and monitor a majority of nodes in any distributed anonymous
routing network (ask me about the Hydra protocol), neither TOR nor any
other planned or proposed anonymizing network provides more than fig
leaf security against that particular cluster of adversaries.  The
same goes for BRICS aligned adversaries.  But even against this
category of attack, TOR may be a useful component in a physical
security protocol for hit-and-run network access.  Against less
capable surveillance actors, TOR is "good enough" unless the operating
system it runs on has itself been compromised.
The largest proven security hazard with TOR is that end users will
disclose their identity in the content of cleartext at an exit node,
either literally or by engaging in stereotyped behavior matching a
profile developed from open public sources, i.e. textual analysis
attacks.  No "airtight" security protocol has ever survived contact
with end users.

Since nobody asked, here's a description of why neither TOR nor any
other existing or presently planned anonymizing protocol I know of can
be relied on to conceal a user's identity from the Five Eyes or any of
several other hostile actors.  I surface this concept every year or
so, but so far nobody seems interested in discussing it.  Maybe it's
just too discouraging to think about.  No matter who created it or
why, TOR and similar mix networks are at best security theater,
relative to top tier State adversaries.

Making users prove they are human without disclosing any personally
identifying information is not an easy task.  As far as I know, nobody
has found a way to do it.
The closest the IT industries have come so far is the CAPTCHA.
Automated CAPTCHA breaking methods include forwarding the challenge
image, puzzle or etc. to 3rd party websites where users solve CAPTCHAS
to access content, and submitting those users' solutions back the site
your automated gadget wants to fool.
Routing TOR traffic back and forth across mutually hostile borders
would indeed be easy to do.  It only requires, as Dr. Strangelove
would say, The WILL to do so!
However, this would lead to...
The State Department funds TOR to defeat national firewalls of
"repressive regimes", enabling communication favorable to the U.S.
National Interest. TOR is a two edged sword that can also be used
against the National Interest, so the NSA thinks TOR stinks.  But
apparently State, CIA etc. will not give TOR up, because of its role
in the development and management of dissident groups in countries
slated for destruction.
A really big bump in TOR traffic crossing the borders of "repressive
regimes" could create traffic jams that degrade TOR's performance
right where the State Department wants TOR to work best, and escalate
the arms race between TOR and the operators of national firewall
filters.  This would shift the cost/benefit ratio for TOR's sponsors
in the wrong direction.  Hence "hairball."
One possible solution would be to build privacy directly into Internet
protocols.  That could drive the costs associated with network
surveillance way up compared to today's rates, while making TOR and
etc. redundant.
Of course, every State and Corporate stakeholder will unite against
implementing any such scheme, even if practicable solutions are found.
 But someday, somewhere a window of opportunity might open up, and
meanwhile "there's no such thing as wasted basic research."

Something like that did cross my mind, and I'm glad you expanded on
the theme.  Here we see the difference between a "protocol" as defined
in software, and a "protocol" for face to face human interaction.  In
theory, the approach outlined above would make a network like TOR
orders of magnitude more effective.
But a problem remains:  Software based solutions are easy to deploy,
"just do it."  End users who know something happened (likely a small
minority, unless the changes degrade service) can keep using, drop
out, or fork the project.  Meatspace based solutions are hard:  They
require the informed participation of /numerous/ geographically
dispersed participants.  Compare the case of the PGP web of trust:  It
only works if a critical mass of well informed, proactive end users
make it work.
Getting enough TOR users to do real work in the real world to register
themselves as TOR users sounds like a non-starter to me.

The big error I see is your apparent belief that TOR should be able to
do impossible things, and interpreting its failure to do so as
evidence of malicious intent by its sponsors and developers.
Overly enthusiastic fans of tools like TOR promise "airtight
security," because they believe that airtight security is possible.
Overly enthusiastic critics of TOR and similar tools demand the same
impossible performance, and consider anything less to be a betrayal of
public trust.
One of the most effective ways to defeat a grass roots political
adversary is to build and unleash opposing camps of True Believers to
fight for and against a simplistic, misrepresented version of whatever
the "unwelcome" advocates are trying to accomplish.  What makes this
approach so effective is that people will do it ALL BY THEMSELVES in
many instances; guiding them to do it harder, faster and better is no
challenge at all if one has a budget for that.
I don't imagine that every outspoken critic of my little ideas is a
paid enemy agent; I prefer a more evidence based brand of paranoia.
To me, the tempest in TOR's teacup looks like a perfectly natural
phenomenon, driven by false hope vs. harsh reality problems.  Everyone
has a right to petition the Universe for redress of grievances against
the laws of physics; this can even be productive, as and when it leads
to an improved understanding of those laws.

[description of issue oriented populist political activism omitted ]
Plus one on that.  Let me get out my Norton II hat & soap box for a
minute here.
Anarchism provides a frame of reference that enables us to understand
how systems of government actually work, and what we can do with and
to them in purely practical terms. Anarchism does not propose a
Utopian system of government to replace the ones already in place, nor
is it a call to "smash the State" and replace it with nothing.
Anarchism describes a group of people who work together for mutual
advantage as a syndicate.  Syndicates organize themselves to develop and
exploit resources for social and economic gain, often in competition
against rival syndicates and among their own membership.
In a stable going concern State, law and public policy are whatever
its dominant syndicates impose by force on the rest of the people in
the territory they control through the State.  In this context force
means applied power, not just physical violence:  Propaganda,
elaborate deceptions and economic incentives do all the heavy lifting.
 Competent State authorities only apply kidnapping and murder when
other methods of manipulation fail:  Violence "is wrong" in the sense
that, except in the context of terrorism (using the threat of violence
to enforce compliant behavior), violence destroys valuable resources
that "should" properly belong to the dominant syndicates.
Anarchists study politics as social power:  Who has it, who does not,
and how these groups interact.  As such, Anarchism provides a frame of
reference for analyzing and comparing various "systems of government"
and for modifying these systems where and as useful opportunities to
do so arise.  A State sanctioned discipline called Human Ecology seeks
to exploit anarchist theory for the exclusive benefit of dominant
Anarchy becomes a visible "force" when and as enough previously
unorganized people push back against State sanctioned syndicates to
forcibly modify those syndicates' behavior.  When dominant syndicates
controlling a State lose touch with reality and exceed the bounds of
their real social power, they may do enough physical and economic harm
to motivate active rebellion among formerly docile State subjects.  At
these times, Anarchists provide propaganda, educational resources, and
facilitation to enable formerly unorganized people to form effective
ad hoc syndicates of their own, and exercise the specific forms of
social and economic power accessible to them.
In the context of political warfare, Anarchism functions as a force
mltiplier:  By themselves, anarchists do not have the material
resource base needed to affect significant changes in the behavior of
State sanctioned syndicates.  But where and as substantial numbers of
disenfranchised people begin to demand social and economic power of
their own, anarchists can facilitate the rapid development of
effective organization, realistic goal setting, and effective action
by those motivated people.  Some call this process Direct Democracy.
As a countermeasure to the potential impact of Anarchist theory and
practice on the behavior of populations dominated by powerful minority
syndicates, State sanctioned propagandists present a fictional version
of Anarchism based on nihilism.  States spare no expense in promoting
and reinforcing a false definition of Anarchy as "violent opposition
to social order of any kind."  Naive self identifying anarchists who
rebel as they are told by State sponsored propagandists provide
"living proof" that the State's definition of Anarchy is correct.  The
well promoted presence of these pseudo-anarchists on mass
communication networks diverts and obstructs public access to
Anarchist resources - except where and as "real" anarchists
effectively weaponize their own understanding of propaganda and
information warfare techniques.
Well that's enough about that for now.
Get busy.

Here's mine:
Over the years three people have told me the same curious story about
how their dog died:  Old and sick, about ready to go, the dog went out
and disappeared:  To be found later, having dug a fairly deep hole in
the ground some distance away from the house, backed into it, and died
there.  None of these animals was "in the habit" of digging holes and
camping there.
An animal that is about to die will not reproduce.  That beast has
already been dealt out of the game.  Yet somehow, the domesticated
canine has acquired a genetic program for a solitary funeral rite:  A
practical one, that inhibits the spread of disease and minimizes
attraction of scavengers etc. to the site.  How is that possible?
The all-conquering Dominant Individual may or may not contribute to
the survival of a community that includes his or her own offspring.
But the individual whose behavior actually does contribute to the
survival of that community increases the odds of his or her
descendants out-competing those of other local communities.  Add
massively iterated trial and error and viola:  Whatever neurophysical
mechanism inspires a dying dog to do that unlikely ritual became a
factory stock feature in the canine world.
The recently popular book Sex At Dawn includes a fatal critique of
"what we think we know" about those horrible killer apes whose example
supposedly explains and excuses human ultra-violence.  Among other
examples, it turns out that foraging apes, when presented with a
single super high value food source daily by anthropologists who want
to study them, do begin to fight over control of that pile of fruit.
The most dominant individuals "would rather let it rot" than allow
others to share it:  A massively iterated genetic trial and error
process prepared them to defend high value food items "as if" there
was only enough for one or two individuals - because that is usually
true of "rare goodies" found while foraging.  But meanwhile, when
observed foraging in the wild, members of the same species tend to
announce their finds to attract others to areas where more goodies are
likely to be found, by bragging on the way cool find /they/ own.
Among Homo Saps, the massive advantages of language and technology
have given a free ride to individuals who get top marks in
intelligence, strength and psychopathy.  They organize for mutual
advantage and spread their contra-survival social traits through the
population like a wildfire.  Thanks to abstract language, the capacity
to lie gives them a powerful arsenal of behavioral manipulation
techniques and they will seize on any opportunity to rationalize and

and deification of those who accumulate the most wealth and power at
the expense of the community has yet to be bred out of the human
species by massively iterated trial and error.

My take-away:
"The notion of retaliation, as such, is absent from Russian folklore,
as if it were never part of the original 'genetic code' of its people
Â­ the Russian champion has always gone to war as a liberator."
In regions where the climate tries to kill everyone for months on end
every year, "common sense" social behavior and resulting cultural
norms benefit from a massively iterated sorting process; those who are
naturally inclined toward cooperation and a reasonable amount of
self-sacrifice tend to outlive those who are not so inclined.  Given
enough time this sorting process will affect the physical genome as
well as the implicit semantic content of "culture."
Bad weather makes good neighbors.  I have been saying this since I was
a teenager, having by then lived in a range of locations from tropical
to sub-arctic.
Of course there are a lot of other variables.  Civilization so-called
is pure poison to the human spirit as well as the natural world it
exploits, ruins and discards in the name of Progress.  The pervasive
propaganda narrative describing Western civilization as the ascent of
Man from barbarous savagery to nobility and enlightenment may be the
biggest Big Lie ever told.

The word "honeypot" comes to mind at once.  If "you and yours" did not
set up, maintain, and control access to such a space, "secure" does
not belong in its name.
The presence of the word "public" also raises an eyebrow, as "no
security protocol has ever survived contact with end users."
Maybe I exaggerate a little.  Maybe not.  These objections do not rule
out the possibility of something useful being accomplished, only point
out challenges that will need creative solutions and constant attention.

Control had a portable version of the cone of silence - basically two

on the Chief's head then ended up shattered the first time it was deployed.
I have come to realize the Agent 86 may have been the greatest
intelligence officer of his generation:  That is if, as I now suspect,
he was working for Kaos all along.  Smart wasted vast amounts of
Control's money, misdirected 100% of its manpower and resources toward a
crew of small time losers who were probably a KGB front set up for the
purpose, and completely demoralized Control's Chief and (all but one of)
his fellow Agents.  And they fell for it.  To such an extent that
Control went out of business for good just five years after Smart showed

The "conspiracy theory" meme was widely circulated by the CIA in a
1967 memo to its private sector press agents titled âCountering
Criticism of the Warren Commission Report,â advising them in detail on
how to assist in the suppression of independent investigation of the
JFK murder.  This document was released in 1976 in response to a New
York Times FOIA filing, as CIA Document 1035-960.
"Innuendo of such seriousness affects not only the individual
concerned, but also the whole reputation of the American government.
Our organization itself is directly involved: among other facts, we
contributed information to the investigation. Conspiracy theories have
frequently thrown suspicion on our organization, for example by
falsely alleging that Lee Harvey Oswald worked for us. The aim of this
dispatch is to provide material countering and discrediting the claims
of the conspiracy theorists, so as to inhibit the circulation of such
claims in other countries. Background information is supplied in a
classified section and in a number of unclassified attachments."
The agency also directed its members âto employ propaganda assets to
[negate] and refute the attacks of the critics. Book reviews and
feature articles are particularly appropriate for this purpose.â

Today, State sponsored propagandists have embraced the cottage
industry promoting "conspiracy theories" on the Internet as an
effective weapon of information warfare.  Although the Internet makes
censorship of unwelcome information difficult or impossible once it is
in circulation, staining such information with the taint of "lunatick
bullshit" is easy:  Find or create false, easily disproven narratives
describing the same subject matter, and assure that they are
prominently featured and vigorously promoted by click bait website
operators whose sites are already loaded with obviously delusional
content.  Social media promotion by a self recruiting army of
volunteer nut jobs does the rest.

What is truth?
Pilate asked this question to underline the fact that in his house, his
words were true simply because he said them.  That's a fringe benefit of
working under authority granted by a living God, i.e. the Roman Emperor.
Truth in the common, everyday sense means honest reporting. "Telling the
truth" is no guarantee of factual accuracy per evidence unknown to the
speaker, or reasoning not used by the speaker, but a best effort by all
involved leads to useful results.  An engineer might say that truth is
whatever concepts and data provide maximum practical utility.
Propagandists take a very utilitarian approach since manufacturing truth
is their stock in trade.  Professionals in that field have no delusion
that truth cam exist independently of the interests it serves.
In formal games including maths, truth is whatever complies with the
rules of the game.  Among my favorite "truths" is the family of logical
statements that are both true (well formed) and self contradictory, i.e.
Goedel's incompleteness theorem.  These formally provable truths pop the
bubble of "objectivity," leaving us in a world where, at best, truth is
context-dependent and strictly local.
Another way to look at truth is in the context of "authenticity."  Is a
given person "true to" his or herself?  Conscious of the role of the
individual as an active participant in creating truth?  This take on
truth puts it in the same bucket as freedom and beauty; the stuff of
art, not science.

Crazy?  More like far out.
Universal surveillance enables abuses of State power only when
access to collected data is restricted to State sanctioned actors.
 When everything becomes searchable by anybody, the inability of
State sanctioned actors to conceal their activities or effectively
lie about their history and motives will inhibit their potential
for destructive action.  "Power over others" depends in large part
on secrecy, while "powers of self determination" depend largely on
free and open access to information.
In the long run, the secrecy problem will take care of itself,
because the abuses of power it enables have already killed the
State:  At least, in the sense that a trans-national State hard
wired for self destruction, defending that program by any means
necessary, is "already dead."

Hash: SHA1
An independent audit found a substantial deficiency in one of the
dependencies of the SecureDrop document submission / management
protocol.  SecureDrop gave the devs time to fix it before
publishing, but so far the issue remains unresolved:
Publishing the unredacted SecureDrop 0.3.4 audit report
vs. SecureDrop uses OSSEC, a popular open source host-based intrusion
detection system (HIDS). The OSSEC architecture consists of a
single central server, called the Manager, which monitors one or
more systems. The monitored systems have programs called Agents,
which collect a variety of information and forward it to the
Manager for analysis and correlation.
The Manager and the Agents may communicate with one of two
protocols: "syslog" or "secure". The "secure" protocol is a custom
crypto protocol based on shared secret keys that are set up during
OSSEC deployment. NCC Group reviewed the custom protocol and found
two serious issues in its cryptographic design:
    Protocol messages are encrypted with the shared secret key
using Blowfish in CBC mode. Unfortunately, the protocol uses a
static initialization vector (IV) to encrypt and decrypt all
messages. This essentially reduces CBC mode to ECB mode and fails
to achieve semantic security.
    Protocol messages are not authenticated. Each message includes
an MD5 hash of the plaintext payload with the encrypted content,
but this is not a strong authenticator. Among other things, it
violates Moxie Marlinspike's "Cryptographic Doom Principle".
For more detail, see the finding in the unredacted audit report.
NCC Group did not take the time to investigate a proof of concept
(PoC) attack based on this vulnerability, but that is not
surprising given the limited duration of their engagement and the
fact that their focus was on SecureDrop, not OSSEC. Nonetheless,
these are serious cryptographic design flaws that could lead to a
practical attack in the future. We encourage all OSSEC users to
examine their current deployments, consider the level of exposure
of any OSSEC "secure" protocol traffic to potential adversaries,
and make changes accordingly.

"The guns" tend to backfire:  Common or garden variety capital
murders by police officers in the U.S. has re-ignited the Civil
Rights movement, for example.  Putting that big black genii back
in the bottle is a job for covert political warfare via
propaganda, deception and PsyOps.
The outcome of every revolution I have studied was determined
before the first shot was fired.  The real damage enabled by mass
surveillance in State and Corporate hands includes:
Fine tuning and targeting of propaganda in near realtime to
achieve maximum influence.
Early detection and proactive response to disrupt and co-opt
"trending" populist and radical factions.
Automated social network mapping and behavior analysis in support
of political warfare.
Not so much Joe Six Pack as Jane Citizen Journalist.  Up to a
point of diminishing returns, every time "the guns" are used
against her, a dozen more of her appear.  As the point of
diminishing returns for that function approaches, civil uprisings
in response to State violence become likely.
The most important single item of State propaganda against
populist and radical politics:  Power over others depends on guns.
Any challenge to State power that depends primarily on armed
conflict has a single, certain outcome:  Victory for the State.
Again, the outcome of a revolution is determined before the first
shot is fired.  Building a large base of popular support and a
network of ideologically committed cadres is the key to success,
and the principal objective of State political warfare is to
prevent this from happening.
Naive wannabe anarchists who want to "go directly to guns, do not
pass the hat, do not collect 200 supporters" only provide the
State with a handy means of discrediting its more /effective/

I haven't seen such a comparison, although from my reading it
appears that the Russian government may have done a better job
with their evacuation - understandable, because tsunami.
And, after first exhausting every wrong answer (Russian military
used conventional firefighting methods, greatly exacerbating the
situation), they finally listened to the engineers and stabilized
the remains of the melted reactor.  Not so the Japanese; last I
heard they have not even /located/ the fissionable material that's
still cooking merrily along.
According to a National Geographic article citing Japanese govt.
sources, groundwater from under the Fukushima complex was entering
the Pacific at a rate of 300 tons daily.  Same article said
strontium 90 was 100 times more abundant than cesium isotopes in
collected waste water stored on-site.
Reuters article from 2012: "Small amounts of cesium-137 and
cesium-134 were detected in 15 tuna caught near San Diego in
August 2011, about four months after these chemicals were released
into the water off Japan's east coast, scientists reported on Monday
Strotium was not tested for, as that costs way more than looking
for cesium isotopes.  Fun fact:  Strontium 90 mimics calcium and
concentrates in food chains.  The Japan Current runs north to the
Aleutians and east to North America.  But the Pacific based
seafood industries can breathe easy:  USDA has increases allowable
levels of hot isotopes, and if you can't prove in Court that a
particular environmental source caused your cancer, nobody is
So, how much /worse/ is Fukushima than Chernobyl?  As Gully Foyle
would say, "guesses for grabs."  My guess is, in terms of long
term environmental and human health, way worse.

Lemme drag out my soap box...
I have a three point plan for safe nuclear power:
1)  Repeal the industry's blanket immunity from prosecution for
civil liabilities.  If it's so safe, why do the owners need to be
above the law?
2)  Remove the industry's public funding, which presently includes
massive subsidies on many fronts.  If it's such a freakin'
technology miracle, it can pay for itself.
3)  Open source every detail of design, construction, operation,
QA and safety inspection, and decommissioning of nuclear power
plants and their inputs/ouputs (fuel, waste), with publication as
near to realtime as materially possible.  Near-miss and slow-leak
containment breaches due to noncompliance with inspection
schedules need to just go away.
In the United States, compliance with part 1 would end all
investment in, and operation of, nuclear power plants:  No
investor or insurance provider will underwrite a nuclear power
plant's exposure under equally applied tort law.
Compliance with part 2 would disentangle the nuclear power
industry from the nuclear warhead and military reactor industry,
its de facto sponsor and sugar daddy - as well as removing tax
incentives and "free money" awarded by Utilities Commissions.  No
free ride on the public's nickel means no nuclear power industry,
balance-sheet wise.
Part 3, which invokes "many eyeballs" to assure maybe just barely
safe enough for optimists safety, would unleash a massive
shitstorm/clusterfuck of commercial and military secrecy issues,
and require extraordinary budgets for QA compliance and reporting.
 Oops, that too should be enough by itself to shut the industry down
Me no rikey nuclear electric power plants.  The Obama
Administration's firmly committed support of the nuclear power
industry reflects an ideological and political-economy mandate to
reduce global carbon emissions while /preserving/ centralized
ownership, control and income from power generation.
Decentralized solutions are non-starters because high-density
power generation means high-density capitalization and income

This article's title foreshadows its content:  Many complex words

possible meanings to them.  On the whole it looks to me like a
verbal Rorschach inkblot; devoid of content, but the reader might
see his or her own latent beliefs peeking out here and there to
create an illusion of deeper meaning.
The whole semantic content of the article does appear in two
sentences buried near the middle of the text:  "Fort Russ provides
cutting-edge reports and analyses which lay bare realities which
mainstream Western media actively distorts, obscures, or flat out
conceals. This is absolutely crucial."  Here the author lays bare
his own apparent intentions and method, attributing them to The
Enemy like a good little propagandist should.
And that's all I have to say about that.

Distributed development of software, involving people scattered
all over the world, is routine these days.  Adapting tools like
git and i2p to create hard to find, hard to suppress projects
physically hosted at multiple locations in mutually hostile legal
jurisdictions is only a question of motivation:  When the
perceived value of a project exceeds the costs of making it
"stateless" and very hard to suppress, people will most likely do
just that.  I can't think of any technical barriers.
People who are competent to make "crypto products" are uniquely
qualified to do that particular trick.

I would have thought it obvious that I was talking about laptops,
where people (even Fox Muldur per a recent X Files episode) actually
do that tape thing.  Everyone knows that a phone has a built in
microphone, nobody forgets that.  Portable workstation computers?  Not
so much, except those who do use them routinely for teleconferencing.
 Hence the comic aspect of tape over the lens with a live microphone
If one is concerned about being tracked during a specific time frame
via a "smart" phone, the solutions include:  Leave it home, ask a
friend to take it on a trip with them, or pull the battery.  Which to
use depends on the cause of that concern and other unique parameters.
Since user surveillance, tracking and profiling is commercially
valuable to the vendors of IOT gadgetry, software solutions will be
placebos, or at best an arms race with the vast majority of end users
on the loser's bench for the duration.
Fact of the matter is, the most practical and reliable means of
addressing privacy concerns related to the "internet of things" is at
the gross hardware level DIY level, by disabling sensor and/or comms
components where and as the user deems this a good trade off.

Good catch!  With July 4 coming up the Take Back The Fourth people
should have uses for this and similar paranoia vs. rage inducing
In military aviation circles, black airplanes (which include
helicopters) are ones without tail numbers, that don't file flight
plans and keep their transponders off.  So the FBI and DHS flights
reported in the Buzzfeed article were anything but:  Their identities
and flight paths are highly visible in the public record.
That's enough to make me conclude that these missions have are mostly
about burning allocated budgets in time for renewal, and normalizing
"routine" aerial surveillance in advance of any Court challenges
regarding specific abuses.  Whether the redundancy of building
frequently updated high resolution Google Earth type views of
"amusing" landscapes will be of any practical use is probably not a
factor in whether or not they happen, and get paid for.  I would be
more interested in knowing what IT vendors are involved and how much
they are making, than in what they are storing and how they are
processing it.
Re black airplanes, I have seen four:  All in Orlando, FL which is a
major epicenter of surveillance tech development.  One late afternon
in early December of 1999 three literal black helicopters flew over
the downtown area at low altitude, passing directly over the City Hall
building.  They looked like customized passenger carriers, with Big
shrouds over their engines.  Their rotors were startlingly quiet:  I
expected to see a helicopter at normal altitude in the distance when I
looked up, and three passed directly overhead just above treetop
level.  At the time I guessed Somebody was putting on a show,
demonstrating their ability to evacuate any "important" people from
downtown in the event of a Y2K Bug Apocalypse.
A couple of years later, about a half mile from the same spot, an all
white helicopter with no markings /or/ visible windows stood station
for about 15 minutes at about 1500 feet, 1/4 mile south of a small
anti-war demonstration at Colonial Drive and Magnolia.  At the same
time, a team was working the crowd - taking names and "why you came
out today" under the guise of "I'm a journalism student." This was
done under the watchful eye of a guy in shades at the back of the
crowd who was taking notes between holding a non-stop conversation
with his cuff links.  The FBI had just opened a brand new
"anti-terrorism" school in town.

I wasn't able to find much detail on that case (in just a couple of
minutes), but it appears that the crew in question were reportedly
using a "custom" stego application to hide documents in photos.
Steganalysis tools that look for statistical and other anomalies in
photos (or audio, etc.) have been under development since ever, and
seem to work very well; presumably NSA et al have way better ones than
we do.  This suggests that the only way to make steganograhy work
against State actors is to "act normal" and hope for the best, i.e.
that your message traffic will not be inspected.  This may sound like
it would work, given the terabytes per millisecond of potential
carrier files crossing the networks - way more than can be stored and
analyzed fast enough for full coverage.
Only one little problem:  Everyone who has traveled to any "hostile
jurisdiction" and everyone who has ever used the word "steganography"
in a cleartext message, visited websites on the topic, participated in
any kind of online discussion about cryptography, etc. is a small
enough set that a large part of /their/ message traffic could be
routinely inspected for hidden content by State level actors.  So that
leaves most spies and all of /us/ out in the cold.
Not sure how Truecrypt volumes constitute steganography. Padded
ciphertext is still ciphertext, plain as day.
If state-level actors are /caught/ using these methods against the
NSA, that would tend to demonstrate that the methods in question do
not work against State actors.
Hiding files inside of files seems to be a bust, but that's not the
only vector for steganography.  Manipulating the timing of signal
traffic, the timing of "real" environmental noise in audio recordings,
the presence/absence/number/postion of certain objects in normal
photographs, the presence/location of specific words in text files
etc. could convey covert messages with little or no risk of detection
through automated analysis - but could not hide kilo- or megabytes of
information per carrier file.
Any practical stego detection protocol should include native analysis
of images embedded in PDF files, with no additional computational
overhead vs. analyzing plain old image files.  In the case of
analyzing the content of seized computer, the presence of stego tools
should assure full steganalysis of all relevant files - and stored
message traffic to and from the user.
Me neither, but I used to be very interested in stenography.  Reading
up on the subject led me to the conclusion that it should work /great/
against adversaries who "suspect nothing" and/or don't know that
stenography exists.  Other adversaries, not so much - unless, as noted
above, one is using a system more akin to a code than a cipher, which
hides a /few/ bits of information in plain sight via the presence,
absence or position of "normal" content in text or media files.

Seems a simple question: The more data you are hiding, and the more
capable one's adversary, the less likely that steganography will work.
I think "code book" steganography, where pre-determined messages from
a list of messages known only to the sender and receiver are
transmitted via fully visible message timing, content, etc. is very
likely to work until or unless a copy of the code book falls into
hostile hands.
Example: "Any forum post from me, transmitted during an even numbered
hour, is an emergency distress call. Any forum post from you
transmitted during an even numbered hour means "help is on the way,"
odd numbered hour means "sorry, you're on your own."
Hiding arbitrary data inside media files by flipping bits is likely to
fool a human observer, but unlikely to pass through a stego detection
filter without tripping an alarm.

This little polemic illustrates a classic political warfare technique
I call "rebel as you are told."  One of the most effective ways to
combat social/political reform movements is to create and promote
front groups that co-opt movements and factions with legitimate
grievances by presenting vindictive, divisive, self defeating versions
of same to the public.  This method is expensive but worth it, because
when it works an independent, self sustaining, self funding and self
defeating fad displaces a potentially effective reform movement - and
whoever is profiting from the abuses of power the original reform
movement sought to remove can rest easy for a decade or more.
I believe this tactic evolved from the simple black propaganda
technique of creating bogus advocates to stand up strawmen in the name
of various real-life reform campaigns.  Someone noticed that these
strawmen can be taken at face value by naive people whose interests it
pretends to speak for, and ran with it.

One ostensible 'disproof' of the moon landing was the claim that the video camera didn't show any stars in the moon's sky.  However, the scenery seen in those shots (lunar soil; equipment; astronauts) was extremely bright, somewhat like a beach in full sunlight.  The contrast ratios of (non-silicon) video pickup tubes in that era were not wide, meaning that any star in the sky (other than the sun) couldn't be visible AND show the backgrounds too.
