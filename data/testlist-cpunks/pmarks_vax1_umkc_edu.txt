@_subject: Encryption for OS/2 
I would like to hear from CP's who have implemented PGP on OS/2.  I'm a
little concerned that I can only encrypt FAT files when the bulk of my data are on HPFS formatted drives.  Is there a group out there?
Second item.  I have some comments on Communications Security (COMSEC)
I would like to make but I think I'd better post anonymously.  Could
someone point me to a suitable forwarder?

@_subject: Distributed "Family" of processors 
I recognized the basic schema in the following from the history of the
French Resistance movement.  The idea is for critical information to be held in separate "cells" each of which knows only enough to inteact with the others, but not enough to compromise the entire net.
   Consider three sets of code in three computers that constitutes a
"Family"(the whole program). "Grandpa" talks to "Pa". "Pa" then talks
"Son". "Son" then talks to "Grandpa". Each "Family" member closely
monitors its cup clock & if its expected message is not received on
time - it suicides! Capture "Pa" & in seconds, "Grandpa" & "Son" take
their own lives! That is to say, they scramble certain essential parts
of themselves including cryptographic sections.
In any covert activity, many conditions will lead to a mission abort.  This
is largely due to the paranoid nature of the activity and the low level of
trust in others neccessitated by said activity.  If even one aspect seems "wrong" the meeting, transmission, transfer, trade, whatever, is called off. No offense intended, and ususally none taken.  When you are trying to be
covert, everyone fears compromise.
A computer system so paranoid that it swallows a poison-pill whenever it suspects unauthorized tampering (read: investigation) would be fairly secure,
but unreliable.  ***Many*** conditions would trigger the "trip-wire" mech-
anisms so the system would have to have a high order of built-in redundency.
What it always boils down to is, "who do you **really** trust?".  Or, boy
was my face red when I found out I vouched for my best friend's public key only to find out that he worked for the NSA.  (Think it doesn't happen?  HUMINT will tell you much more than Signal Analysis ever will.)

@_subject: So, what are we going to do? 
reader to the list.  In fact, until I started reading WiReD, Cud, EFF, and this list, I didn't even know that I had to worry about privacy in cyberspace.  RE: the folowing
This is largely, however, off the topic.  What is important, and a point
on which I think we agree, is that the regulation of strong crypto, or in
your definition, the interference in the marketplace, is unacceptable,
unneeded and nothing more than a calculated attempt to maintain the
status quo of usurpation of individual rights in favor of federal power
and influence.  Even the national security externality falls when one
considers the uselessness of export regulation in the age of digital
The genie is already out of the bottle.  They might legislate it, even criminalize it, but private non-clipper crypto is here.  I believe it is here to stay.  At least, I'm not giving up _MY_ copy of PGP.  As long as I've got a copy, my friends can get copies.  Their friends can get copies from them.  Just _HOW_ heavy-handed does the Justice Dept. plan to get? "we have a search warrant to locate illegal cryptography in your possession!" and run off with my equipment?  _That_ could be quite embarrassing for crypto users like me, who are _not_ pornographers, drug dealers, or terrorrists to show up in court.  What is the prosecuter going to tell the judge?  "So far, we've decyphered his secret bar-b-que sauce recipie and his grandmothers instructions for making chocolate-chip cookies, but we expect to have the plaintext of his letter to his sister anytime now."  data files were my own, and nobody else's, business.  I just thought I was entitled to a little privacy."  How would that read in the press? Could the government really afford to look that stupid?  (Unless, of course, they really _are_.)

@_subject: Security Consult. Needed 
Concerning the following, Duncan Frissell makes an excellent point we should
all consider seriously:
One of the city's largest bookies was busted when the Feds intercepted the
daily fax transmissions summarizing business results sent from his NY
office to his Florida home.
A major cocaine dealer is facing prosecution based on written transaction
records seized at his office.  His simple code was broken by a "known
plaintext attack" when investigators were able to match his written
notations with transaction information derived from wiretaps.
Can't anyone help these people?  Maybe 178th Street needs PGP and Secure
Drive more than the PC Expo.
You are absolutely correct!  For too long, licensed Attourneys and Certified Public Accountants have been making comfortable careers representing clients from the, shall we say, "underworld."  It is time for cryptographic experts to be recognized as the true professionals they are and proudly join the ranks of other professionals who represent thieves, extortionists, junkies, drug dealers, embezzelers, etc.
Oh yes, I almost forgot.  Once Clipper is the law of the land, Congressmen will no doubt want to keep their private files safe from the snooping eyes of their political enemies.  So they will need crypto-consultants to find "creative ways" to work around the very regulations they stood by and permitted to go into effect.  I can hear them rationalizing now, "that is an Executive Branch rule that the Legislative Branch is not bound by."
Who will be laughing then?

@_subject: Useful Ways to Fight Crime 
This gave me another warped idea:
Why don't we just outlaw curtains and window blinds?  That way, law enforcement officials could just drive down the street looking into windows!  It would make it *much* easier for them to tell if crime was
being committed.  Of course, some people might not like the loss of privacy but the civil libertarians are making too much of this anyway. Besides, law abiding citizens should have nothing to hide, right?  So why should they object? Oh, e-mail is differnt altogether?  So.  When did you start mailing all your letters in clear envelopes?

@_subject: Virtual Cash 
Hal and Blanc have started an intesting thread on the concept of "digital money" or "Tacky Tokens."  I'm not sure what they are talking about, exactly.
But it sounds like "vitual money."  I would like to see a description of the model for this.  Sounds like a form of barter-script.  I'd like to see more on this.
