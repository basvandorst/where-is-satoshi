Ok, lets say it becomes a US felony to "misslabel" a web site.  How does
that prevent a person in the US from setting up a misslabeled or unlabed
site on a server in another country?  Also, what about person who sets
a site that is misslabeled on a server in the US.  Do the feds try to
extridite the person?
I think that we will find that labeling web sites is less workable than

Why?  Why does Mr. Finkelstein need to play be Washington's "game"
I understand why you need to play by the rules.  As a Washington insider
you are between a rock and a hard place.  If you step outside the rules,
you loose your connections, your influince, and you livelyhood.  (No I
not consider being an insider to be bad.  I apreciate the flow of news
we might not otherwise get).
For those of us who are outside of the "game" (by choice or otherwise)
it does not make since to play.  Nobody in Washington listens to us (or
that is the way it seems).  To give up those fundamental liberties
hurts us.  Insted we change the system by playing outside of the "game"
(such as writting strong crypto code and giving it away before
makes that illegal).

Well, in theory, requiring a licenced press would violate the 1st
Requiring any kind of rateing on a web page would seem to be the same as
requiring a newspaper to rate itself to protect someone from reading a
story that would be offensive to her/him. I don't beleave the newspaper
industry would stand by and let that happen to them.
Hehe.  Who ever said people were smart?

How can a law, or how it is applied be exempt from judicial review?
If I understand the first amendment correctly, this is not legal.
AMENDMENT I
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of
speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to
assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. Article III, section 2 of the Constitution states:
1. ***The judicial power shall extend to all cases, in law and equity,
arising under this constitution, the laws of the United States, and
treaties made, or which shall be made under their authority***; to all
cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls; to
all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; to controversies
to which the United States shall be a party; [to controversies between
two or more states, between a state and citizens of another state,
between citizens of different states, between citizens of the same
state, claiming lands under grants of different states, and between a
state, or the citizens thereof, and foreign states, citizens or
The 11th Amendment didn't change the part between the *'s.
If this is correct, any law that Congress would make that prevented me
from seeking judicial review would be unconstitutional.

Ok, we write code.  But as James S. Tyre pointed out, if the code is
too difficult to use it will not be.  And as Declan pointed out
many/most people will not use the crypto if they must think about it.
Writing the code is no longer enough.  The code must be usable by the
sheeple to work.  How do we do that?

Declan, just an observation, but have you noticed that the media seems

No.  Just difficult.  Look at the rise of Linux and Free/Net/OpenBSD.  They are
slowly making it into the mainstream (I found a copy of RedHat Linux and
InfoMagic Linux for sale at a CompUSA last week).
Linux was slow to take off because it is an OS and difficult to learn from
scratch.  If we make programs for mainstream (Windows, MacOS, OS/2) that are
VERY easy to use, do somthing everyone wants, and are free (with source code), I
think they will take off.

After reading all the stuff on MDT's, a got an idea.
How about a central monitoring web site (out of the US).  This system
would run a small server program that could accept input, via the net,
from MDT monitors around the country.  Each MDT monitor would collect
data and send it in once every 5 minutes.
A person could goto a web site and see what is going on around the
country.  Hmmm.  Watching the watchers??

May I suggest trying what we did here in Colorado.  Take a look at our
Taxpayers Bill of Rights.  No government in Colorado (state, county or
local) can raise taxes without putting the measure before the public
for a vote.  We have, for the time being, tied the hands of the
government.  They can't just spend money and expect to raise taxes to
cover the short fall.
It took 5 state wide elections to amend the constitution, but the
public finely wised up.  Each election, the State would promise to
change their spending habits.  They broke that promise every time,
once within days of the election.
We have also, on a few occasions, amended our state constitution to
force the government to fund specific items (Education for one) before
any other items may be funded.
If your North Carolina allows the public to patition to have a measure
put before the public in an election, try doing it.  It's not perfect,
but it might send a clear message to the government.
  Please forgive the grammar errors.  I suffer from using a Microsoft
spelling checker that likes to change the meaning of my words.
