Wouldn't that be completely obvious? If Saddam just happened to die of "natural
causes" it seems to me like anyone with half a brain would be able to figure
what probably happened. Maybe I'm remembering this incorrectly, but I think
when he was captured they said he was healthy. Regardless of whether or not
was actually the case, if it is in fact the official position, it seems like it
would create troubles for a "natural death" scenario.
What would seem more likely to me is a Jack Ruby-style assassination. US forces
let Iraqi security escort Saddam from prison to the beginning of his trial, for
a nice photo-op. Unfortunately, as everyone knows, these Iraqi guards are still
adjusting and what have you, so oops, somehow a vengeful individual gets
and shoots Saddam in front of all the cameras. Sure, we would have rather had
him tried in a just court, but he /did/ make a lot of enemies over the years,
and you know how that works...
Hell, they might not even have to explicitly hire anyone to do it. Just make
sure security is kind of slack and let word of this slip out, and the problem
takes care of itself...

Hrm, apologies for the piss-poor formatting (or so it appears to me) and lack
of subject line in my last post (reproduced below with better formatting
(I hope)). I'm stuck using a webmail interface for the time being and I've not
quite gotten used to it yet.
