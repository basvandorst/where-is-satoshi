References: I think underlying the electoral question is a more fundamental issue- as you said in later in your message, if the race isn't close, it doesn't matter.  The question then is "in a fairly close race is it better for the president to be the person who represents the most people or the person who represents the most territory". The electoral college is designed choose the president based on territorial representation.
