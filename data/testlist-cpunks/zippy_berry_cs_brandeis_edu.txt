   it.  So sign with Working Assets and write them a note telling them you want
   to see a phonecard-only option soon, and chances are they'll be responsive
   if they get enough of those.  Especially if they're getting them from people
   who used to have accounts with teh Big Three.
Isn't Working Assets just a reseller of AT+T (or is it Sprint) LD?  As
such, you're still giving business to one of "the Big Three".

   Ego + Espionage = Death
Taking other well-known identities:
Silence = Death
Energy = Mass x Speed-o-Light^2 and the assumption that the energy of one's ego cannot exceed one's
maximum potential energy (which has great explanatory powers re. the
Limbaugh Effect).
I get:
solving for Espionage,
which raises some interesting points:
Item 2 is supported by the following etymology
    espionage (es pi o nage; es p     n  azh , -
    nij, es  p     n  azh ) n.      1 n.
            the practice of spying on others.
    2 n.
            the systematic use of spies by a government to discover
            the military and political secrets of other nations.
    Etymology:
             F espionnage, MF espionage, equiv. to espionn(^B er)(to)
            spy(deriv. of espion spy  It spione  Gmc; akin to
            G sp  ahen to look out)  - age - AGE
Further anecdotal support - the French use an unbreakable code in most
of their communications.  A clear affront in the face of the
government's Clipper Chip proposal that all encrypted messages must be
based on a key escrow system.
Of course, the French could go far to mollifying U.S. intelligence
interests by supplying either their Platinum-Irridium Espionage
standard, or adopting a U.S. approved cipher system.  For the latter,
I think the US would be happy to approve "rot13" for export.
