@_subject: The legality of PGP 
I've been reading a lot of speculation and outright disinformation about
the legality of PGP.  Does anyone have any informed information about the
actual legal status us sing and disseminating the program?
My SuperIllegal Key :
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: 2.0
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

@_subject: PGP 2.01 2.02 
Where can the latest revisions of PGP be found?
Tried the sci.crypt archive site, but the just had 2.0.
Can anyone help?
BTW, here's my key:
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: 2.0
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

@_subject: 386des wanted 
Does anyone possess a copy of the des package 386des? I've heard that it
is incredibly fast, and would like to look at a copy. I have been unable
to find it on any of the regular crypto haunts on the inet.
Thanks in advance

Man you guys generate lots of stuff...
Anyhow I noticed that some of you are using fakemail...
Are you using a shell script for this? The only fakemail scripts I've seen
have not really worked.  Could someone forward a copy to me?

@_subject: pgp key distribution 
I'm pretty new to this mailing list, so something along these lines may
have already been proposed, but I was considering the possibility of
putting together a list of pgp public keys for distribution through this
list.  My own collection of keys is pretty small, and I would pernally like to expand this, but I think this would provide a great service to the
group as well.  Let me know what you all think.
