He could be using an automatic search for the string at the beginning of
pgp encrypted messages.  Maybe someone on his system could check this out
by removing the strings and seeing if he notices it then.  Not that I'm
encouraging anyone to break the rules of the system you understand :)

@_subject: Disinformation (or the truth?) about clipper 
Given that this is a public forum, is it a good idea to announce that
you are going to lie about Clipper?  Next time Tim May (for example)
is on a radio prog talking about Clipper, he is wide open to the question
'Why should we believe you? Your group advocates spreading disinformation
doesn't it?'
I agree that this should be fought, but I would be cautious about announcing
tactics like this to the world.
