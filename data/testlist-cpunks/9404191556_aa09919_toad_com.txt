   -------------------------- [Original Message] -------------------------      conservative.  I know that this puts off a number of people, but we are each entitled to our own opinion.  I feel that we do need a government in power, but that they have a limited role in our society.  If we didn't have at some ruling power in control, the country would be in total anarchy and we would be taken over by some intolerate country.  The beauty of our system of government protects our rights.  We need a military to protect everyone's ass in this country.  I feel that the government infringes to much on other peoples rights in this country as it is, especially with the current president.  At least with a conservative government in control, they want to keep the money and the power in the hands of the people.
right to privacy.  Personally I feel that the Clipper chip, is a severe infringement upon our rights, and I do NOT support its use.  Notice that I use PGP and not PEM or DES.  If someone is smart enough to use RSA, then they deserve to be able to talk in privacy.  I know that it can be used for alterior motives, but that is the risk with any tool that is available for use.  I hope this helps to explain my opinions a bit better.  I welcome you comments.  BTW, where are those political pieces that people have written.  I would like to look at them, to further educate myself.
