Thanks for the deeply intellectual addition to the discussion in progress.
Perhaps you could send Steve Orr a message from a non-anon account
explaining why you think his troll shows he's a clueless newbie, or, even
better, forward some of the research material to him, so we don't wind up
with another sensational, uninformative article.
Oh well, I guess it's each to his ability...

I say this only to defend by Pedantics degree, but I believe that
FrameMaker was originally a UNIX product that was horribly ported to the
Macintosh.  (I had the unfortunate experience of using the first Mac
incarnotion; I racked up some pretty good karma... :-)
Did that ;-)  It's amazing how much of office routine can be done with the
simple application of cut-and-paste boilerplate.

they're at capacity just opening envelopes and manually entering names and

That a bunch of their staff is the minimum-wage "gee, look at my Mac" crowd
might have something to do with it.  I was amazed to find out that there
really are two sides to Wired: the professional computer geeks (eg.
Negroponte) and the professional get-a-magazine-out geeks, and the twain
never seem to meet.

HEY, MORONS!  THIS IS AN ASSEMBLAGE OF PERSONS INTERESTED IN THE
FURTHERANCE OF CRYPTOGRPAHY.  While it is true that to persons not familiar
with a particular operating system, it may appear cryptic, this really
isn't what cryptography is all about.  TAKE IT ELSEWHERE!

I was under the impression that "the Communications Assistance for Law
Enforcement Act requires equipment manufacturers and telecommunications
carriers to develop network technologies that are readily wiretapped" (from
Garfinkel's book).  Doesn't a "hardware encryption device for use in lots
of communications devices, including cell phones, PDAs, etc." seem to fall
into that category?
If it doesn't then I have no idea what CALEA is supposed to do.

[really horrid story about true life at a corporate dinosaur deleted]
Part of my job-interviewing procedure has become grilling a would-be
employer (or whoever is asking for a contractor) about their net
connections.  I've been very pleasantly surprized that most [techie] places
are okay on a perspecive employee being interested in the tech grunge of
net access, and considering it part of the working environment, a benefit,
like gourmet coffee.
On the other hand, HP (that god-awful backwards cesspool of bureacracy) had
full net connections to the outside world (when I was there, since turned
off) but in a pathetic attempt to show due diligence searched our
briefcases and backpacks (but not the contents of the laptops, floppies, or
tape cartridges therein).  Someone's going to have to explain to their
legal counsel that taking paper versions out isn't the most efficient
way... :-)
