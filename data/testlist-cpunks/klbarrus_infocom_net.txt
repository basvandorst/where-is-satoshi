What this means is that 9^2 mod 35 = 11, and 8^2 mod 35 = 29.  See the list
right above the chart that is confusing you.
For example, it lists x^2 = 29 mod 35 has a solution: x = 8,13,22,27
So actually there are 3 other solutions... 13, 22, and 27 are also square
roots of 29 mod 35.
Hm... I forgot.  I have one somewhere and will send it along if I find it.
Yes, you can use the Jacobi symbol to determine if a is a quadratic residue
mod n.  See page 207.

Well, I know there are already products like this out there, because the
company I work for uses one.
I was helping my boss/project lead figure out why he couldn't establish an
account on the penet anonymous server, and in the process of phone calls to
various people, we discovered that the anonymous server at penet is blocked
from our site, and also that every web connection is logged.
Actually, I have no problem with this, even if they restrict usenet feed to
the comp heirarchy, restrict web activity to a list of approved sites, log
all they want to, etc.  That's why I got a seperate account.

I think you are refering to Quisquater's (sp?) explanation, which is in
terms of Ali Baba and a magic cave.  A functionally similar explanation is
in Schneier's Applied Crypto, pp. 85-86.
