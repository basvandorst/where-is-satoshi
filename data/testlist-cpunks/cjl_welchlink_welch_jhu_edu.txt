@_subject: Remailer traffic analysis foiling 
Remailer hackers,
I've been thinking about the problem of traffic analysis of anonymous remailers and I have a question to pose to those of you whose thoughts on this topic are "more frequent or fully-formed".  Would there be any advantage to giving remailers a MIRV capability?  The idea goes like this:
The message arrives, the PGP wrapper is removed, the message is scanned for some specific token imbedded in the text (ala Matt Ghio's Cutmarks function).  That token is a divider between two outbound messages.  These messages are sent along their respective ways.  The result is something like a 10K message coming in, and a 7K and a 3K message leaving.
If one of these goes to the bit bucket, it is like having added padding stripped off.  Alternately they each could be part of the real message, previously split and then sent via different paths to reduce chances of complete message interception.
I guess the issues involved are:
1)  How difficult would this be to code?  [Yeah, yeah "Cypherpunks write     code"(TM), but some of us write genetic code, not computer code :-)]
2)  What is the credible threat of traffic analysis?
            problems of scale for these alleged eavesdropers?
        b)  Do you assume that if it's not a compromised server, that Now before the Zippos start flicking, I've followed the the latency vs. reordering argument, and accept that latency *may* acheive reordering, but not necessarily.  In this system though, different latencies after the split would seem to acheive something because without reliable size in/out information it would be harder to correlate message in with messages out.
Comments (incendiary or or otherwise) requested.

I think that sending many copies of the same message sounds like a good
way of making sure that it ends up being monitored by some alleged surveillance net.  Sending dummy messages is another matter. A fivefold increase in traffic may or may not have an impact on analysis, depending on your assumptions about the adversary's capabilities.  Anyway,
you still have a message of fixed size going in one end, coming out the other, and landing in someone's mailbox.  The superfluous messages may in fact be easy to identify if they are addressed to bit.bucket at dev.null.  C. J. Leonard                     (    /      "DNA is groovy"

Since it was posted twice I guess I can reply twice :-)
This scheme wouldn't be workable in the currently fragile and ephemeral net of remailers.  They would have to spend a lot of time talking to each other and making sure that they all had up-to-date lists of valid remailers.  That's too much of a burden to put on the net.philanthropists
that are currently operating mailing lists.
Any validation of a chained remailer pathway is up to the user (not exactly *caveat emptor* cause you ain't paying for anything, but you get the idea)

Chain is one such DOS program for chaining remailers [available on a c-punx site near you :-)].  It needs to be fed a file called chain.ini which is just a list of remailers with stars in front of the PGP-capable ones.  I was grepping Matt Ghio's automagical remailer list and just editing it down to the list of remailers (and adding stars) after putting the public keys on my keychain.  I very much appreciate the service he has been providing.  Thanx Matt.

drop ominous hints about their real intentions.  It would be good for there to be C-punk observers there at the very least.
Someone with a better usenet feed might want to repost this to the usual newsgroups.  IMPORTANT NOTE:  Application deadline, August 19th 5pm EST
Computer Issues:  Call for Applications
Applications are invited for participation in the second conference on "Legal, Ethical, and Technological Aspects of Network Use and Abuse"
cosponsored by the National Conference of Lawyers and Scientists, a
joint committee of the American Association for the Advancement of Science
and the American Bar Association.
The workshop, scheduled for 7 to 9 October 1994 at a conference center not far from Washington DC, will weigh ideas about what is acceptable behavior
in a shared computer environment.  Discussions will center on three themes:
1) determining accountablilty and liabiltiy for network content;
2) defining what network content is "public" and what is "private"; and
3) what ethical, legal, and administrative frameworks should be employed
   for the global information infrastructure.
Up to three successful applicants will receive expenses to attend the workshop, which will have 40 participants from a variety of perspectives
and disciplines.
Each applicant must submit a 1000-word paper addressing one of the three themes above (the papers will be circulated prior to the meeting), a
short resume or biographical sketch, and a brief statement of how one's
expertise or perspective might contribute to the meeting.  The application
deadline is 19 August at 5pm EST.  E-mail responses are preferred.  Those
selected will be notified by 9 September.

Since the bomb thread won't die a seemly death I thought I'd throw in my
.00000002 megabucks.  Modern H bombs are actually fission-fusion-fission
devices. The traditional U-235 (or Pu-239) atomic bomb sets off a fusion reaction burning the tritium, producing alot of fast neutrons that in turn
sets off another fission explosion in the otherwise non-fissile U-238 that is wrapped around the outside of the bomb.  More bang for the buck, and it gives you something to do with all that U-238 you got while purifying the U-235.

@_subject: Tuna fish and spam sandwich 
I am curious about what is happening on alt.test.  Someone is apparently forging letters containing the line:
I am (insert True Name and address here)
from a large list of account names and sending them through anon at penet.fi to alt.test.  If the address is not previously registered with penet.fi it generates a new acct number (thus the long list of messages with sequential acct nums anXXXXXX) however every once in a while there will be a message (they are all 43 lines long, and have the subject "tuna fish test numero nnn" making them easy to spot from real anon.testers) that will have an account number that is out of sequence (e.g. a much
lower number).  It would seem that this is revealing the anon acct numbers
of people who have already got accts at penet.fi.  There are a number of
messages posted to alt.test from apparently real acct addresses saying
that they never requested anon accts. and generally disavowing all
knowledge of how the "tuna fish" messages ended up posted.
Does this form of "lunch-sack" attack really work?  By spamming penet.fi
with "tuna fish" messages with forged From: lines can one really get the
true names and corresponding anon acct numbers of people from a list of addresses?  If this is possible then I'm sure it wouldn't take long for one of you mail-gurus to whip up some code to download a "who cypherpunks"
and feed it through a spam grinder to recover true names.  So much for trusting a Finnish Identity Escrow Agent.

@_subject: Crypto-history 
Crypto-history buffs,
Apropos the recent discussion of the Bletchley Park and NSA exhibits of WWII rotor-type cipher machines on sci.crypt, there is an excellent article by Glenn Zorpette (of IEEE Spectrum) in the Summer 1994 issue of American Heritage of Invention and Technology, Volume 10/Number 1.  This is a Forbes publication that is put out by their American Heritage Magazine group. The title of the article is "The Edison of Secret Codes" and it is about Edward Hugh Hebern who contributed much to the development of rotor-type cipher machines from 1912 until after WWII.  It features quotes from David Kahn (The Codebreakers) and some terrific photos of early cryptographic equipment, as well as a nice description of the design/function of the machines and vulnerabilities to cryptanalysis by the Army's William Friedman in the 1920's.  There lawsuit by Hebern against patent infringement by the government serves as an an eerie premonition of the Inslaw case.  There is a sidebar regarding the National Cryptologic Last but not least it features this marvelous stanza of an ode to Hebern's crypto machine, an equally fitting a description of public key systems (e.g. PGP).
Marvelous invention comes out of the West
Triumph of patience, long years without rest
Solved problem of ages, deeper than thought
A code of perfection, a wonder is wrought.

You are perhaps more than just code handicapped.  It seems you also fail to
perceive the implicit YMMV clause that comes with using a service *provided gratis* by someone else.  Ask Raph real nicely, and maybe he'll send you the code for the remail-pinging script so you can run it from your particular corner of the Net, it wouldn't be unprecedented, after all, Raph has freely distributed his hack of premail.
But then again it wouldn't be unprecedented for him to tell you go stuff yourself.  Genuine bug reports on an author's work are best discussed first in private E-mail, and brought to the attention of the list if it is more than a trivial gripe.  BTW, I don't recall seeing the FedEx remailer that promises delivery by 10:00 am the next business morning, or in fact any remailer that promises delivery at all.  Caveat poster.

@_subject: penet remailer 
I personally don't care for the penet type remailers.  Their only true virtue is to allow you to receive return mail to an anon-post.  The trade-off is that this is done by a form of identity escrow.  Julf (who runs penet.fi) has your e-mail address connected to the anonXXXXX identity that you get issued automatically.  As far as reputations go, Julf has an excellent reputation in the C-punx community, and there is little likelihood of Finnish govt. officials giving in to US Govt. pressure to crack down on Julf to turn over his *little black book*.
There was recently an attack on the penet.fi remailer that depended upon the ability to spoof the From: lines on messages, some unknown person sent hundreds of messages to the anon at penet.fi remailer pretending to be hundreds of other people and had those messages sent to alt.test or misc.test with some phrase about tunafish in the subject, causing this to be known as the *tunafish and spam sandwich attack*.  What this did is allocate alot of new anonxxx numbers to people who didn't really want them, (also ultimately denying them the secure use of this service, because someone knew the anonxxx - TrueName correspondence), for those that already had an anonxxx and had set a password things were cool, the messages were just rejected.  For those who had an anonxxx and had not set the password, this attack revealed the anonxxx corresponding to their TrueNames to the person who conducted the attack.  Not a particularly secure form of identity escrow for the clueless-at-risk-of- identification to be using for posting their wildest homo-erotic fantasies to alt.H.E.A.T.fabio.
I was allocated an anxxx I didn't want, and then assigned the password in order to deny the attacker any further use of the anxxx with my TrueName attached to it.

After a couple of comments, I've updated Pinesign to a new version.  This new version adds the ability to choose whether your ascii signature (ie $HOME/.signature) is added.  Some mail servers get confused by extra text, so the ability to make sure nothing extra is added was requested.
Basically, if you want to sign the message both digitally and asciilly (is that a word :-), just press return twice after you exit your composing editor.  Otherwise, make the selections you want specific to the type of message you are sending.
# PINESIGN v2.0
# Written by:  Robert A. Hayden # PINESIGN is a simple program that will allow you to automatically sign # your email and news messages composed with the Pine 3.89 mail reader.  It # may also work with other mail and news programs, but it has not been # tested.
# INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONFIGURING PINE
# # You need to define the following options in Pine.  This can be done # either via the SETUP options in the main menu of Pine, or via editing # the .pinerc. # 	A)	signature-file=" "  (an empty space)
#	B)	enable-alternate-editor-cmd
#	C)	enable-alternate-editor-implicitly (optional but recommended)
#	D) 	signature-at-bottom
#	E)	editor=
# INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONFIGURING PINESIGN
# The PGP program must be in your path, and the PGPPATH environment # variable must be defined.  See the PGP documentation for details.
# Double check that the first line of this program points to sh. # Edit the SIGPATH and PINEEDITOR variables to point at your signature # (if any) and the editor you wish to use for your Pine mail.  Default # signature will be the file .signature in your $HOME directory.  # Default editor is pico -z -t.
PINEEDITOR='pico -z -t'
# INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING PINESIGN
# When you compose a message, you will compose your message as normal.  # When you exit your editor (control-X in Pico), you will receive a prompt # asking if you wish to add your signature file to the message.  If you # respond with y, Y or just press return, your text signature file (often # $HOME/.signature) will be appended to your message.  If you type  # anything else, your message will not have your signature added.
# Next, you will be prompted as to whether you wish to PGP sign your
# message.  If you answer with y, Y or return, you will be prompted for your
# PGP passphrase and then dumped back to the address/subject section of
# Pine.  If you type anything else, your message will not be signed.  # If you selected it to be added, your .signature file will be appended # AFTER your digital signature. # If you have not defined your alternate editor to be run implicitly, you # will need to start it manually.  If you do not run the alternate editor,
# your .signature file will not be appended and you will also have to do
# that manually.  It is highly recommended that your define your alternate
# editor to run implicitly.  DO NOT EDIT ANYTHING BELOW THIS LINE UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING $PINEEDITOR $1

@_subject: Quantum computing/crypto 
Before the list cratered I had been intending to respond to Doug Hughes post about the quantum computing news piece by James Glanz in SCIENCE magazine, 7th July, vol. 269, pg. 28-29.
If you are reading this thread you may be aware of Peter Shor's development of an algorithm that uses quantum logic to factor large numbers.  This was discussed on the list last year and the general take on it was that there was no way to build a functioning quantum computer, and even if there were the code-maker would end up ahead of the code breaker.  Well, it seems that his work stimulated some further interest in the design and construction of quantum computers and even a conference in Torino, Italy a few weeks ago.  In the 15th May Physical Review Letters ther are a number of papers on QC's, including one by Ignacio Cirac & Peter Zoller that describes the construction of a quantum logic gate.  This builds on an article in same issue of PRL by Artur Ekert, David Deutsch and Adriano Barenco describing how by trapping ions in an electric field just above zero degrees Kelvin one can build a "quantum wire" which will pass information without measuring it (and therefore collapsing the quantum uncertainty).  Chris Monroe and David Wineland at NIST in Boulder have already built a simplified version of this quantum logic gate device, and have written a proposal to factor the number 15 using the technique.  The hardware involved will be about 10 mercury atoms.  There is airtime at the end of the piece for skeptics citing the calculations showing that "small errors in a QC can accumulate exponentially and no one has figured out a satisfactory way of reaching into the quantum world to correct them".
As I mentioned before there is a sidebar talking about the successful demonstration of quantum cryptography over 14 kilometeres of fiber optic cable in Los Alamos by Richard Hughes and colleagues, apparently announced at a conference held last month at the Univ. of Rochester in New York.  Alice and Bob can swap bits encoded in the quantum properties of photons that can't be intercepted with out them knowing that something is amiss.

Tech Help for Schools
While high-tech education visionaries are issuing apocalyptic warnings about the fate of the alledgedly backward US school system, a privately sponsored group has launched a Peace Corps-style initiative to ease schools into the 21st century.
The Massachusetts-based Tech Corps, which recruits volunteers to help schools harness computers and telecommunications technology, announced last month that it is going national.  The corps, whose chief sponsor is the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association, will hold a conference in Washington DC on 30 October where people can learn how to start state chapters.  Founded by Gary J. Beach, chief executive officer of Computerworld Inc., the corps last year recruited 300 volunteers theough the magazine Computerworld who have been working in 12 school districts throughout Masachusetts.
Karen Smith, Tech Corps' national director, says the response to the call for volunteers from people in industry, government agencies, and private consulting firms, has been "incredible."  They help school districts in any way they are asked - such as by installing wiring, training teachers, persuading local industry to donate hardware, and helping schools construct World Wide Web homepages.

David P. DiVincenzo from the IBM Research Division has written an article in the 13th October issue of SCIENCE magazine (vol. 270, pg. 255-261) entitled "Quantum Computation".  The article is nicely divide into - Building blocks of quantum logic
- Quantum circuits
- Peter Shor's prime factorization
- The decoherence problem
- Outlook
state of the art in quantum experimental physics that the construction of quantum computers is presently in the most rudimentary stage, and that to even think about a procedure like Shor factorization, which might require millions of operations on thousands of qubits, might be absurdly premature."
If that is the good news for Cypherpunks, then the great news is the ". . even a few bits of quantum computation will be very useful in performing so-called Bell measurements, which could be used to implement quantum teleportation, in which an unknown quantum state can be trasmitted to a remote location.  At perhaps the 10-qubit level, a quantum computer becomes capable of performing Schumacher's quantum coding, which would be of interest in the implementation of efficient quantum cryptography.  And at perhaps the 100-qubit level, a quantum computer becomes an efficient repeater for a noisy (that is partially decohered) quantum cryptographic link."
It looks like the advantages of quantum computing accrue to Alice and Bob, long before it becomes useful to Eve and Mallet.

Here is one for the files. . . . .
On page 49 of WIRED 3.11 is the following tidbit from John Battelle
SUN'S CODEMAKING COMRADES
Here's the problem:  Because the US government has outlawed the export of industrial-strength encryption, firms seeking to do business abroad find themselves without trustworthy security options once they leave US boundaries.  How can companies in the information and networking business, such as Sun Microsystems, possibly sell a system to Alcatel in France, for example, if the encryption that accompanies it can be broken by a 14-year-old with too much time on his or her hands?  They can't.  So Sun came up with a novel solution: buy Russian.  The Soviets may have sucked at cars and strip malls, but they sure as hell knew their cryptography.  "The Russians can make any kind of encryption you want" says Geoffrey Baehr chief network officer at Sun.  And what can the US government do about a product developed outside its borders?  Nothing.
In fact, Sun was so taken with Russia's computing talent that the company recently hired the entire team once responsible for the next generation of Soviet supercomputers (and the Russians brought along the plans for the beasts).  Ask Sun chief scientist John Gage if he'd rely on US-approved encryption to send those plans between Moscow and California, and he'll laugh out loud.  "We can't rely on that stuff.  We're talkling trade secrets here!" - John Battelle
This looks like a striking example of regulatory arbitrage at work, and if it can be confirmed in its details ought to be an extremely powerful anecdote in the hands of those working against GAK and ITAR.
The sucking sound is American jobs heading overseas, the snorting sound is American trade-secrets being sniffed up     by foriegn competitiors, the cackling sound is the laughter of the Four Horseman, who (if they     bother) just buy strong crypto from some hard-currency hungry unemployed     ex-Soviet programmer.

What else, Chaum's Digicash.  If you are unwilling to part with any of your own, perhaps you can collect contributions, or maybe the Digicash people will pony-up some extra cyberbucks for a good cause.  After all, they are worth the paper they're printed on. :-)

Why is it that I seem to recall that one of the responses by a govt. official to the intercept was the infamous diplomatic quote
"Gentlemen do not read other gentlemen's mail"
Ah, would that this sentiment were more common in government circles today (sigh) . . . . C. J. Leonard                     (    /      "DNA is groovy"
