LE, Gov and private industry have always been bedfellows - they will

The gov can get IP addresses for sybil attacks, they don't need to smuggle

I don't think you can 'rely' on any of them, to coderman's point.
Your best bet is to enumerate the list of TLD delegated authoritative
servers, then recursively send legal threats to each.
The one who demonstrates the most impressive apathy may be your winner :)
Of course, you may want to follow the concept of pitting two noncooperative
countries against each other.
If the threat to your name isnt specifically tied to a subset of all
jurisdictions.. You might have a problem.
You might, then, establish a protocol. The hash of the website CNN.com's
contents, for instance, may serve as a backup domain.
Realistically its really down to finding a cool registrar & TLD pair. TBP
may be your best example here.
As a final note: if you're worried about these kinds of problems you
probably shouldn't be using clearnet.

I'm partial to Joanna Rutkowska's statement that "Security by Isolation" is
the best course followed for -users- of software. [in addition to all the
patching and whatever.]
Developers of that software, ultimately, are responsible for securing their
stuff. As an aside - separating your complex system into multiple trust
zones, from a development standpoint, is de-rigueur for secure design.
Security heads have long been decrying cgi-bin. Most of the reason is that
the threat surface is insane - for binaries you have user input that's not
running in some sort of VM [php,perl,ruby,node.js, etc] and existing in
memory entangled with executable instructions.
Injection attacks, are, of course old-hat. The daemons could have done some
hand-holding in this respect before passing off headers to ENV variables.
The issue is that 'restricted chars' wasn't defined by a standard interface
between daemon and cgi-bin script. The called function has a completely
arbitrary set of restricted chars.
calling user controls the env / and bash is executed under that user's
So it is, of a matter of course, inevitable to find vulnerability there.
With one process isolating the client from the env, modifying the env as a
result of the user's whims and then passing off to a sub-process that
trusts the env implicitly.
It is very unlikely that any TLA 'created' this vulnerability. The notion
is entirely incredible. The existence of vulnerability in such a design is
immediately obvious from anyone who takes more than a cursory look at it.
That isn't to say that this specific attack was trivial to identify - that
is to say from an architecture standpoint it should be evident that the
handoff between httpd and cgi-bin is a location of extreme vulnerability.
On a related note: Mirage OS looks like it's on a promising tack:

Decisions in application architecture, class, method/function, IPC/RPC &
other data-flow are fairly unique between coders. Also, very difficult to

The generation of equivalent functional code, and higher-level

required. That's not trivial.

then there is very little you need to do, except, perhaps, clear your
browser history.

*Cough* AFAIK if 'OK google' works anything like on Android (and it should)
it locally processes for the trigger phrase, then provides both audio and
visual queues its recording your voice. They aren't constantly recording
everything you say and uploading it.
It's not exactly the 1984 two-way A/V system its made out to be. Inspect
the source for yourself rather than relying on fantastical reporting.
Google's products and services are not free, I don't find it surprising
that they datamine voice, they've been offering 'free' PBX systems for
years in exchange for all voice traffic that transits through it - directly
using this to train voice recognition along with YouTube videos and so on.
Anything on your machine can be tapping you. Your attackers don't need to
bake it into the browser - doing so would be idiotic. Your attackers can
piggy on updates, TAO in, use an exploit or simply bug you. It's way easier
to pop a 10$ bug in the room rather than risking burning some 0day worth
infinitely more on you.

Theory: In-Q-Tel funds - pushing the envelope means having opportunity to
fund more stuff that breaks the new, harder stuff. Some opponents use the
harder stuff already, it's just harder to fund if it's not widespread.
The article reaches a bit in drawing conclusions, and offers little
support. The picture painted is of a coherent judicial system - the
opposite is true, each state even municipality treats the novel application
of surveillance technology differently, holds different standards for
'public / private' and when, where and how you can expect privacy. Notable
are the ways different courts treat cases of indecent exposure, when that
exposure occurs on 'private property' (such as in an open window).
The point illustrated, though, is valid - some clarity around what
constitutes a 'search' beyond 'privacy mores in vogue' needs to be provided
and codified, otherwise the US risks allowing widespread complacency to
further continue the erosion of privacy.

COINTELPRO Techniques for dilution, misdirection and control of a internet
There are several techniques for the control and manipulation of a internet
forum no matter what, or who is on it. We will go over each technique and
demonstrate that only a minimal number of operatives can be used to
eventually and effectively gain a control of a 'uncontrolled forum.'
Technique  - 'FORUM SLIDING'
If a very sensitive posting of a critical nature has been posted on a forum
- it can be quickly removed from public view by 'forum sliding.' In this
technique a number of unrelated posts are quietly prepositioned on the
forum and allowed to 'age.' Each of these misdirectional forum postings can
then be called upon at will to trigger a 'forum slide.' The second
requirement is that several fake accounts exist, which can be called upon,
to ensure that this technique is not exposed to the public. To trigger a
'forum slide' and 'flush' the critical post out of public view it is simply
a matter of logging into each account both real and fake and then
'replying' to prepositined postings with a simple 1 or 2 line comment. This
brings the unrelated postings to the top of the forum list, and the
critical posting 'slides' down the front page, and quickly out of public
view. Although it is difficult or impossible to censor the posting it is
now lost in a sea of unrelated and unuseful postings. By this means it
becomes effective to keep the readers of the forum reading unrelated and
non-issue items.
Technique  - 'CONSENSUS CRACKING'
A second highly effective technique (which you can see in operation all the
time at  is 'consensus cracking.' To develop a
consensus crack, the following technique is used. Under the guise of a fake
account a posting is made which looks legitimate and is towards the truth
is made - but the critical point is that it has a VERY WEAK PREMISE without
substantive proof to back the posting. Once this is done then under
alternative fake accounts a very strong position in your favour is slowly
introduced over the life of the posting. It is IMPERATIVE that both sides
are initially presented, so the uninformed reader cannot determine which
side is the truth. As postings and replies are made the stronger 'evidence'
or disinformation in your favour is slowly 'seeded in.' Thus the uninformed
reader will most like develop the same position as you, and if their
position is against you their opposition to your posting will be most
likely dropped. However in some cases where the forum members are highly
educated and can counter your disinformation with real facts and linked
postings, you can then 'abort' the consensus cracking by initiating a
'forum slide.'
Technique  - 'TOPIC DILUTION'
Topic dilution is not only effective in forum sliding it is also very
useful in keeping the forum readers on unrelated and non-productive issues.
This is a critical and useful technique to cause a 'RESOURCE BURN.' By
implementing continual and non-related postings that distract and disrupt
(trolling ) the forum readers they are more effectively stopped from
anything of any real productivity. If the intensity of gradual dilution is
intense enough, the readers will effectively stop researching and simply
slip into a 'gossip mode.' In this state they can be more easily
misdirected away from facts towards uninformed conjecture and opinion. The
less informed they are the more effective and easy it becomes to control
the entire group in the direction that you would desire the group to go in.
It must be stressed that a proper assessment of the psychological
capabilities and levels of education is first determined of the group to
determine at what level to 'drive in the wedge.' By being too far off topic
too quickly it may trigger censorship by a forum moderator.
Technique  - 'INFORMATION COLLECTION'
Information collection is also a very effective method to determine the
psychological level of the forum members, and to gather intelligence that
can be used against them. In this technique in a light and positive
environment a 'show you mine so me yours' posting is initiated. From the
number of replies and the answers that are provided much statistical
information can be gathered. An example is to post your 'favourite weapon'
and then encourage other members of the forum to showcase what they have.
In this matter it can be determined by reverse proration what percentage of
the forum community owns a firearm, and or a illegal weapon. This same
method can be used by posing as one of the form members and posting your
favourite 'technique of operation.' From the replies various methods that
the group utilizes can be studied and effective methods developed to stop
them from their activities.
Technique  - 'ANGER TROLLING'
Statistically, there is always a percentage of the forum posters who are
more inclined to violence. In order to determine who these individuals are,
it is a requirement to present a image to the forum to deliberately incite
a strong psychological reaction. From this the most violent in the group
can be effectively singled out for reverse IP location and possibly local
enforcement tracking. To accomplish this only requires posting a link to a
video depicting a local police officer massively abusing his power against
a very innocent individual. Statistically of the million or so police
officers in America there is always one or two being caught abusing there
powers and the taping of the activity can be then used for intelligence
gathering purposes - without the requirement to 'stage' a fake abuse video.
This method is extremely effective, and the more so the more abusive the
video can be made to look. Sometimes it is useful to 'lead' the forum by
replying to your own posting with your own statement of violent intent, and
that you 'do not care what the authorities think!!' inflammation. By doing
this and showing no fear it may be more effective in getting the more
silent and self-disciplined violent intent members of the forum to slip and
post their real intentions. This can be used later in a court of law during
Technique  - 'GAINING FULL CONTROL'
It is important to also be harvesting and continually maneuvering for a
forum moderator position. Once this position is obtained, the forum can
then be effectively and quietly controlled by deleting unfavourable
postings - and one can eventually steer the forum into complete failure and
lack of interest by the general public. This is the 'ultimate victory' as
the forum is no longer participated with by the general public and no
longer useful in maintaining their freedoms. Depending on the level of
control you can obtain, you can deliberately steer a forum into defeat by
censoring postings, deleting memberships, flooding, and or accidentally
taking the forum offline. By this method the forum can be quickly killed.
However it is not always in the interest to kill a forum as it can be
converted into a 'honey pot' gathering center to collect and misdirect
newcomers and from this point be completely used for your control for your
agenda purposes.
Remember these techniques are only effective if the forum participants DO
NOT KNOW ABOUT THEM. Once they are aware of these techniques the operation
can completely fail, and the forum can become uncontrolled. At this point
other avenues must be considered such as initiating a false legal
precidence to simply have the forum shut down and taken offline. This is
not desirable as it then leaves the enforcement agencies unable to track
the percentage of those in the population who always resist attempts for
control against them. Many other techniques can be utilized and developed
by the individual and as you develop further techniques of infiltration and
control it is imperative to share then with HQ.
Twenty-Five Rules of Disinformation
Note: The first rule and last five (or six, depending on situation) rules
are generally not directly within the ability of the traditional disinfo
artist to apply. These rules are generally used more directly by those at
the leadership, key players, or planning level of the criminal conspiracy
or conspiracy to cover up.
1. Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil. Regardless of what you know,
don't discuss it -- especially if you are a public figure, news anchor,
etc. If it's not reported, it didn't happen, and you never have to deal
with the issues.
2. Become incredulous and indignant. Avoid discussing key issues and
instead focus on side issues which can be used show the topic as being
critical of some otherwise sacrosanct group or theme. This is also known as
the 'How dare you!' gambit.
3. Create rumor mongers. Avoid discussing issues by describing all charges,
regardless of venue or evidence, as mere rumors and wild accusations. Other
derogatory terms mutually exclusive of truth may work as well. This method
which works especially well with a silent press, because the only way the
public can learn of the facts are through such 'arguable rumors'. If you
can associate the material with the Internet, use this fact to certify it a
'wild rumor' from a 'bunch of kids on the Internet' which can have no basis
in fact.
4. Use a straw man. Find or create a seeming element of your opponent's
argument which you can easily knock down to make yourself look good and the
opponent to look bad. Either make up an issue you may safely imply exists
based on your interpretation of the opponent/opponent arguments/situation,
or select the weakest aspect of the weakest charges. Amplify their
significance and destroy them in a way which appears to debunk all the
charges, real and fabricated alike, while actually avoiding discussion of
the real issues.
5. Sidetrack opponents with name calling and ridicule. This is also known
as the primary 'attack the messenger' ploy, though other methods qualify as
variants of that approach. Associate opponents with unpopular titles such
as 'kooks', 'right-wing', 'liberal', 'left-wing', 'terrorists', 'conspiracy
buffs', 'radicals', 'militia', 'racists', 'religious fanatics', 'sexual
deviates', and so forth. This makes others shrink from support out of fear
of gaining the same label, and you avoid dealing with issues.
6. Hit and Run. In any public forum, make a brief attack of your opponent
or the opponent position and then scamper off before an answer can be
fielded, or simply ignore any answer. This works extremely well in Internet
and letters-to-the-editor environments where a steady stream of new
identities can be called upon without having to explain criticism,
reasoning -- simply make an accusation or other attack, never discussing
issues, and never answering any subsequent response, for that would dignify
the opponent's viewpoint.
7. Question motives. Twist or amplify any fact which could be taken to
imply that the opponent operates out of a hidden personal agenda or other
bias. This avoids discussing issues and forces the accuser on the defensive.
8. Invoke authority. Claim for yourself or associate yourself with
authority and present your argument with enough 'jargon' and 'minutia' to
illustrate you are 'one who knows', and simply say it isn't so without
discussing issues or demonstrating concretely why or citing sources.
9. Play Dumb. No matter what evidence or logical argument is offered, avoid
discussing issues except with denials they have any credibility, make any
sense, provide any proof, contain or make a point, have logic, or support a
conclusion. Mix well for maximum effect.
10. Associate opponent charges with old news. A derivative of the straw man

We may first want to understand the minimum resolution that timing
requires. Keypress events can be randomized within this interval.
Another track:
170WPM ~= 42000 KPH ~= 11 KPS
So, maybe we have 90ms delay on average between keystrokes for a speed
I didn't realize you could use keystroke analysis to identify one person
out of a pool of millions, rather, that a certain keystroke pattern matches
as best a certain subset of users but it wouldn't be valuable/practical for
positive identification. Text analysis is probably a way more useful signal.

It's sort of like voice biometrics - two people can share the same 'feature

It's not useful for positive identification by itself, out of that large
database there would be many collisions.
The content of text that you type, the words you use and your grammatical
structure contain more identifying bits.

It's simple.
Someone made a mistake. Best was initially assumed full of shit by JYA, as
he's a neophyte - and is consistently 'off-message' for this list.
Others, wishing to read more into it, other than face value of hubris, see
plans within plans.
At the end of the day, Bests' disclosures amount to nothing of consequence.
At best he overhyped them, being a neophyte. At worst he's JTRIGd the list,
hilariously easily. The technical cognoscenti on the list stay quiet, "code
compiling" as the good doctor says.
In general, this oversight is valuable because it demonstrates one thing:
Even if you try to delete it.
If there's a signal it will leak. Purposefully or not.

Agree that 'open source software' may very well be a prerequisite. My point
being that a laptop put together to 'minimize blob use' is not necessarily
the same as one put together to respect privacy. Without some evidence to
the fact it should not be endorsed as such.
Can someone dig up the motherboard design documents, should Librem publish
them & the transparent process by which components were selected to
'respect liberty'?
OT aside - If someone were to ask what laptop they should use for 'privacy'
I'd personally direct them to buy a chromebook with cash at a brick and
mortar, wipe & install Qubes (the pixel 2 has some outstanding specs) TAILS
and so on.

"secure identity and access management tools"
Internet2 is a not-for-profit United States computer networking consortium
led by members from the research and education communities, industry, and
government.[2] The Internet2 consortium administrative headquarters are
located in Ann Arbor, Michigan, with offices in Washington, D.C. and
Emeryville, California.[1]
As of November 2013, Internet2 has over 500 members including 251
institutions of higher education,[3] 9 partners and 76 members from
industry,[4] over 100 research and education networks or connector
organizations,[5][6] and 67 affiliate members.[7]
Internet2 operates the Internet2 Network,[8] an Internet Protocol network
using optical fiber that delivers network services for research and
education, and provides a secure network testing and research environment.
In late 2007, Internet2 began operating its newest dynamic circuit network,
the Internet2 DCN, an advanced technology that allows user-based allocation
of data circuits over the fiber-optic network.
The Internet2 Network, through its regional network and connector members,
connects over 60,000 U.S. educational, research, government and "community
anchor" institutions, from primary and secondary schools to community
colleges and universities, public libraries and museums to health care
The Internet2 community develops and deploys network technologies for the
future of the Internet. These technologies include large-scale network
performance measurement and management tools,[10] secure identity and
access management tools[11] and capabilities such as scheduling
high-bandwidth, high-performance circuits.[12]
Internet2 members serve on several advisory councils,[13] collaborate in a
variety of working groups and special interest groups,[14] gather at spring
and fall member meetings,[15] and are encouraged to participate in the
strategic planning process.[16]

So, one of the difficulties w/ web-apps is that the 'code' is dynamic. You
cannot implement a secure system if your attacker can change the code at
any point in time. As is the threat model with backends, which attest to
their 'trust me' security (a la lavabit, hushmail and so on) - so is the
problem with client side code. If you build a web-app which does in-browser
encryption and never sends the encryption key to the backend your attacker
can simply modify the static JS source, DOM inject and XSS their way to
your sweet sweet encrypted keys. Even if you audit your code at one point
in time, you aren't certain it doesn't change with every request to the
The first hurdle here is allowing users to reason about 'versions of
web-app client assets' - if any part of the 'web-app client' relies on
dynamic / non static JS, the application cannot effectively be 'versioned'
(unless those sub-components are similarly versionable). A subset of HTML
and JS is defined (safe javascript language subsets are a fail) AND the JS
VM is modified to 'lock in' its object defns after loading.
So, then you can take the set of client side assets (html, js, images so
on) hash each, add some version metadata and sign it. Version 1.
Now, users with the browser mod / plugin can then see version 1 of the
site. I can go out and post to CPunks statements like, Version 1 of
el8notes never sends your plaintext password to the server and all of your
communiques are encrypted before being sent to the server, and have them
hold true both now and in the future.
If you trust version 1 of el8notes, or you trust my assessments of
el8mailer you can then tell your sweet plugin: Version 1 of el8notes,
signature whatever is a-ok in my book.
Of course, this might not even require the participation of content
producers. Such a plugin could, in theory, create its own versioning for
web assets & distribute those observations to a P2P network.

This particular feature has no bearing on that specific attack.
In general, it looks like Cloudflare will 'handle cert generation for you'
- if that extends to a relationship with CAs - who will sign those, then
yes regardless.
The real question here is whether the feature detection is done in a way
that is susceptible to downgrade attack.
If your threat model involves Cloudflare behaving maliciously - then you
shouldn't use Cloudflare.
If your threat model involves attacker controlled PKI - as it should - then
you should 'cert-pin the leaf.'

+ I'll re-iterate the need for non-dynamic/safe JavaScript (e.g. Caja) & a
form of 'web asset versioning and integrity'.
