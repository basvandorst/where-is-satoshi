:Bay Area Cypherpunks,
:I am hereby pledging US$100 towards a fund to fly Dimitri to the
:SF Bay area for a Cypherpunk meeting. Set a date for this event, I fly around the country, if I can arrange
my schedual around the time of this meeting, I will gladly match the
100 USD.
:We should throw in a hotel room
Not so fast, let's see, if his topic is good, then I will contribute
another $50 twords a stay at the Embasy Suites in Walnut Creek ( Very
Nice Dimitri, they serve breakfast in bed upon request)
 On the flip side, if he doesn't live up to the expectations of being
a world class cryptographer, well he can flop out in one of the BART
stations downtown.
:and local transportation as well.  Let's tie this to how well he does too, if he does well, we get him a
car, if he flunks out, well, he's covered there too, He can panhandle
for change and ride BART.
