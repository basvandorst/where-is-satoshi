STARTTLS for both IMAP and SMTP over the normal ports; haven't
tried POP3, although it looks like it should work. and this seems to
work for mulberry on linux, macs and windows.

--On Tuesday, 01 October, 2002 13:54 +1200 Peter Gutmann maybe. i'm not sure how many players support it (my spectral D/A
convertor does, but then some of the people at spectral seem to
have invented HDCD). while the CDs i have that use it sound
pretty good, i don't have any good way to compare them when
played back over a non-HDCD capable convertor (i could hook
up one of my computer CD drives, but that doesn't seem fair
compared to the spectral transport-D/A combination).
but when i do play such CDs on other gear, i don't notice any
audible degradation, so it isn't obviously harmful.
i've seen comments in reviews of professional CD mastering
gear that there are other, seemingly preferred, technologies,
although i've never found details of them.
