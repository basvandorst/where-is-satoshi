*sigh*.  I'm personally of the opinion that the total amount of damage the human race has been able to do to itself as a percentage of the population has remained essentially constant.  Let me rephrase that... The total amount of damage the human race is doing to itself as a percentage of the population has remained constant.  Any increase in destructive potential has been met with a commensurate increase in population and a decline in our willingness to use those tools.  We may be able to kill millions today but 10,000 years ago that wasn't much less than the world population.
