There are times when all that can be said is Amen!!! Most of these people have
absolutely no clue to the way the government REALLY works! The feds will set
up a "little" fish in order to catch what they consider to be a "big" one.  Ask Randy Weaver! They weren't really after him... they were after the Aryan Nations.
They wanted Mr. Weaver to infiltrate for them... So they attempted to encourage
his enthusiasm... How? They set him up on a bogus gun charge... when that wasn't successful... They killed his family!
The problem is people still live under the mistaken notion that there are rules!
When the congress and the courts passed laws allowing the confiscation of property without due process and further allowed the proceeds from the sell of that property to fund the coffers of the agencies that took those properties, they
assured our descent into a totalitarian state. We are like the walking wounded,
soon to be the walking dead. We are dead and don't know it! Unless the tree of
Liberty is watered soon... it seems we are doomed!

Actually... this sounds like a GREAT IDEA!!! Do you know how many cops you could catch with one of those??? I cannot count the times I've had cops go by
me at speeds in excess of 80 mph without lights or sirens! Everyone ought to check one of those things out, catch the cops and turn it in to your local media

@_subject: Mandatory ID in California? 
Actually, "Failure to Identify" is a misdemeanor in most municipalities nationwide.
It is definitely so here in Indiana, and in most places I've been to. The only thing
surprising is that YOU were not aware of this! :-) The point being the Cops always
want to know who they're fuc... er, dealing with. The first thing they'll do is radio
in who they're accous... er, stopping. The reason for this is, should they get their
just desserts... I mean come to some harm, the rest of their gang... I mean, brother officers will know who to come after! :-)

@_subject: Smartcards are coming to the US 
Hummm... Did you ever wonder *why* this was introduced to the "third-world"
countries first? If you've been following the progress of the so called "smart-
card," you will have noticed it was first introduced to areas that are extremely
"low-tech" and well off the beaten path. Also the areas it was *first* introduced
were generally marked by a high population density. Notice, "low-tech," high
population density and in locations that are definitely out of the loop when it comes to news coverage. There was obviously a strategy involved and I think
it would be prudent to wonder why.
The U.S. is one of the most technologically advanced nations on the face of the earth. The citizenry are very familiar with technology and are quite adept in it's
uses. Not to mention the fact that some of the worlds pivotal financial markets are
located here, it makes one wonder why they didn't introduce the card here.
I for one am not nearly so intrigued with the benefits of these "smart cards." I
see too much room for mischief. Already, where I live, there are Insurance com-
panies that have access to the data bases of grocery stores in this area. If one
uses one's "debit card" to purchase groceries... and say, purchases a carton of
cigarettes for a loved one or friend, the insurance company has access to that
information. There is a growing collection of information being gathered on every-
one in this country. Although it appears to be harmless, using sophisticated collation and analysis techniques, the accuracy of the inferences *I* believe constitute an invasion of privacy and a clear and present danger. Consider a scheme used by local law enforcement here several years ago. They
set up an operation with the several horticulture stores. Anyone purchasing "grow lights" was noted, their license plates were copied and later... based on the fact, a person purchased a "grow light" a search warrant was issued for the
search of their homes. Although grow lights are used all the time for legitimate
purposes it was assumed that anyone purchasing one was growing marijuana.
Imagine being awakened at 6:00 am by a team of narcotics officers with dogs and a warrant allowing them to search your premises. Given the current asset forfeiture laws, and given that well over 75% of the money supply by government studies has been contaminated with cocaine, you
could lose your home if the dogs happen to "hit" on any money in your home. Never mind you're not one who grows or deals in narcotics, this is extremely
dangerous! In the new anti-terrorism bill recently signed, the FBI has been given
the ability to tap 1 out of 10 phone lines without the need to actually come out and
set up a tap on your line. This will now be handled automatically for them by your
friendly phone company.
I see "smart cards" as one more twist in the ever tightening noose around our
necks and the Bill of Rights. Not only will the cards be able to keep your complete
history from cradle to the grave on them, but what's to prevent them from being
used in the future as an internal passport of sorts? We are rapidly approaching
the point where we will be stopped and required to produce our papers. This information will be readily available to any government agency... and not a few
corporations to exploit at will. No I'm not at all enthused with the advent of the
smart card.
Currently there is much discussion regarding various banking institutions charging excessive amounts for transaction fees at your local "ATM."  Wonder
how much they will be looking to charge for this service? Something to think Benjamin T. Moore, Jr.

@_subject: Dealing with Credit Reporting Agencies... 
Well Karl, It seems I missed your idea/solution in this post, however, some of us figured this out some years ago... I begin a campaign almost 10 years ago of feeding the computers false information about myself. I never use the Social
Insecurity Number assigned to me... I don't even give it to the Bank. This makes
for some rather dicey situations. I rarely use my real name or give out my real
phone number. At this point in my life... I have *NO* credit history. I currently have *NO* bank account. My goal is to be completely invisible to the system.
Yes I have had a few glitches in this plan from time to time... but I continue to work on it.
I just have never felt warm and fuzzy knowing that any government agency,
business, or whoever can get my personal information off a computer could come
knock on my door some dark night. If you're interested in fortifying your privacy,
I can give you a few pointers.
1.) Go to your local DMV and inform them you've had a change of address. I
     selected a high rise apartment building with 15 floors and selected an address
     on a non-existant 23rd floor. Getting your Driver's License address changed
     should cost less than $10.00.
2.) Go find a company like "Mail Boxes Etc." and rent a mailbox. The cost is
     nominal compared to the added privacy and security. The distinction between
     a mailbox and a Post Office Box is with a mailbox you have an actual street
     address. You can receive deliveries from UPS and Federal Express at a      mailbox. You can't at a P.O. Box.
3.) This part requires some skill... befriending a graphic artist is a good idea for      this one. But what you need is a phony work identification.  Pick a name! A      couple of "Pass Port Photos" and some lamination and you're good to go.
4.) Take your new persona down to your local utility companies and get the serv-
     ice switched to the name of your new persona. Even get your phone switched
     and have the number non-published. You'll be pleasantly surprised from now
     on, everytime your phone rings, it will be someone you really want to talk to.
5.) Go down to your local Post Office and file a change of address form. Use the
     address of your mailbox. Remember, most companies that provide Mailbox
     service, will need to see your drivers license... which of course now has a
     non-existant address on it.
You can take this as far as you want... Just doing these 5 things will give you a
sense of comfort and security you've probably not had in a long time. How does
this fit into cyperpunks and encryption? The philosophy is the same! What good
is it encrypting your messages to ensure your privacy when everything else is
exposed! It's a lot like an Ostrich burying his head in the sand to hide, but leaving
all his good parts exposed!

Ok I'll respond to this first paragraph:
As I said in my privious post. I have *NO* credit history! I don't know who you ran
but whoever it was... it wasn't me. As for having poor credit, when I did have a credit history, it was quite good... New car and house, never late on a payment.
I've *NEVER* been arrested! So I don't have a police record either! I don't have any kids... So what you've said is specious as regards myself... EVIDENTLY, MY
SYSTEM WORKS PRETTY WELL! Wouldn't you say? :-)
Nope... I'm an American of African and Native American descent. I'm a bit older
than 36... I do not live in Indianapolis, Indiana
I am not Ms. Thompson's bodyguard... I'm in another line of work entirely. :-)
Not true... Don't know who you ran but it obviously wasn't me...
I'm flattered! Wish I was 6'4" and I definitely don't weigh 260#
I am on IRC... which is a good guess, but I've never used the moniker "Shaka."
Don't have kids... you figure it!
Again, wrong person!
Called Indianapolis, The don't have a newspaper called the Post... Again Not me.
You wouldn't perchance be a bigoted law enforcement officer would you? I understand there are plenty in the Indianpolis area... :-)
This is a violation of Indiana Code but breaking the law is of no concern to you, huh?
As I don't live in Indianapolis... that's really of no concern of mine... How they are used? I'm specificaly telling you how to use them! Obviously you
are a plant and a spy in this mailing list for the government! It is people of your
ilk we want, need and demand protection from!
Given the fact you ran the wrong person... my system must work extremely well!
You're just the nefarious type my system is designed to circumvent! Better luck
next time!
