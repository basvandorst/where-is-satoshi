compressed, Internet connections in general are not. I have a citation
of a paper somewhere (mentioned on the com-priv mailing list) which
(if I recall correctly) said that less than 1/3 of the traffic over
the NSFnet backbone used any kind of compression...
transmission time -- more often files at ftp sites are compressed to
save disk space at the ftp site, and possibly to reduce ftp transit
time to remote sites. (That said, there are some versions of ftpd,
namely the wuarchive one, that given a foo.Z if you request foo it
will automatically decompress it for you in case you don't have
compress; I think the same support for gzip exists (is trivial in any
case), though I don't know if many sites have it installed.

lefty at apple.com might have said:
sommerfeld at orchard.medford.ma.us might have replied:
If you looked inside, perhaps you saw where the switches are?
I've been told that the SecurId cards have two membrane-style switches
on the face (not actually marked though.) The initial key is
programmed by keying it in through those switches; the "protocol" ends
with a command to "ignore any further input from these switches"...
Early ones were hand-keyed, they then went to a robot mechanism, and
now apparently there is a device which takes a hopper full of cards
and keys them in in parallel batches (something like 20 at a time for
the machine I heard about a year ago.)
This is all stories I heard (as far as I know, second hand from
SecurID people) but it would be interesting to confirm the existance
of the switches...

@_subject: Key Servers 
Executive summary: if you care about true people, sign their keys, or
create an authority that you trust to sign them, and the keyservers
will automatically take care of the rest.
This is really a misunderstanding. (When people start using all
uppercase letters, it usually is.) I don't like to see people I work
closely with (Hi Derek!) the object of such wrath...
Take it easy for a bit here... the key servers (by which I mean the
PGP keyservers such as are run on toxicwaste.mit.edu and elsewhere)
*don't provide any authentication*... all they provide is keys. If you
trust a key because you got it from a key server, then you have
perhaps misunderstood the concept of digital signatures -- you should
be able to "validate" the key based on what's in it, not where you got
it from.
That said, if you or someone of similar interests wanted to provide a
"true identity" key service, you'd simply have to create a key for
that service, advertise it, convince people to belive that you really
were doing a "true identity" service (this is the social side, not the
technical side -- you can't convince them in purely electronic means
any more than you can convince them you even *exist* in purely
electronic means... but you can find some way of building *real world*
trust that suffices...) and then start signing the keys of those you
assert are "true people".
And guess what -- Derek's key server, *and all the others*, would
start carrying your signatures and keys. They wouldn't filter them out
- it wouldn't be worth the trouble :-) and it would be against their
mission which is to provide *keys* not *judgements*...
Please, sir, do not defame the people who are making your desires
possible. Derek has *not* opposed letting *you* sign and publish lists
of true-person keys. He's just brought up the practical point that he
doesn't have time to do it (nor, perhaps, interest) as well as the
technical point that keyservice has *nothing to do* with validity of
keys. He's being generous and done everything you need for
infrastructure -- all you have to do is identify real people and sign
for them (or convince someone *you trust* to do so.)
I hope this clears things up a bit. Noone is preventing this from
happenning. (If I thought I could make money at it, enough to
compensate for the hassle, I'd consider doing it myself... but it
probably wouldn't be competitive with the RSA PCA's, as it usually
takes a *lot* of money to convince me something is worth the
hassle :-)

"MR EICHIN"? gee, last time I saw my name written that way (all caps,
no punctuation on the abbreviation) was from a direct mailing database
program. I half expected to see it followed by "You may have already
won" :-) Before I continue, I'd like to indicate that I find this
discussion interesting, which is why I'm continuing to cc you, Mr.
Detweiler; however, if you'd rather I didn't continue, please let me
But enough of that. Please tell me, MR LD231782, if whomever you got
your Internet email server from ever informed you that the email
addresses might have *nothing* to do with the names they claimed to
be? Malicious or otherwise? [To be fair, *my* network provider actually
does have some intro documentation that explains how insecure email
actually is... but they're unusual in other ways.] The point I'm
trying to make is that the Keyserver is no more guilty for not
mentioning it than your email provider is. Perhaps this is because
they are both assuming (perhaps incorrectly) that you cannot base
trust on machinery. Machinery might help propagate existing trust...
but the trust must start with the people involved (and by that I mean
the entities themselves, *not* the service maintainers.) In case it
wasn't clear, I'm just responding to your point:
 >> why is it that the policy that ANYTHING GOES is NOT MADE CLEAR in
 >> KEYSERVER POLICY DOCUMENTS?
in reference to the "policy documents" of everything else on the net.
For that matter, do you care that if you saw one message in Time
Magazine, you might see a similar message in an statement from Warner
Cable[*], or a number of related places -- because they're all owned by
the same conglomerate? Forget Medusa. Think Warner, Beatrice, TCI, and
other big meta-everything companies, who only *look* like distinct
"individuals" (corporations are individuals in the eyes of the law,
enabled by one of the later amendments...) while in fact they're only
really "tentacles" of a bigger one? [*] I attempt to use the subjunctive here to make a point, not to
claim any actual behaviour of Time-Warner Inc. There are better
examples of this sort of thing anyhow. Sorry I don't have any handy
that are documented well enough...
(Actually, doesn't the FCC already have something to say about this?
something like you can do it as long as you don't own *all* of the
media in an area, but several of each is ok?)
There was a long discussion on another mailing list (with only a
slightly higher S/N than this one, but far more politics, as the vocal
membership includes employees of NSF, CIA, ANS, IBM, STD and other
TLA's :-) about someone who was posting from an address in their name
representing a political project from an educational site. Someone
else was curious about this, and contacted the postmaster. They
contacted the account owner, and had some time of figuring out what
was going on... turns out it was the *reverse* of PSEUDOSPOOFING,
namely, there was one account with *several* true names behind it. (It
was "exposed" because they didn't "keep their stories consistent" or
something like that.)
Now, do you find this reverse-PSEUDOSPOOFING (I leave the upper case
letters since I've never seen the world spelled without them)
objectionable as well? I'm not trying to set up a semantic trap here
or anything, I'm just trying to understand the bounds of the issue,
and get some idea what you see as ok, and what you see as
"flabbergasting." I reject the idea that just because you perceive
something that "many people might" perceive it the same way... so
please don't try to generalize, just let me know what *you* think.

Quoth michael.shipett at umich.edu:
Actually, BYTE used to publish things in "BYTEcode", a simple barcode
system (narrow for 0, wide for 1, or something like that, no
modulation of the gap like you find in UPC) and they had articles
spread over several years on how to build simple readers, both
hardware side and software side. (One even involved wrapping the page
around a coffee can, placing it on a turntable, and then having a
latching device to move the wand "up" one "track" on signal from the
computer...  so it could automatically retry bad tracks...) If people
really care to resurrect it, I could go digging, email me if you'd
like me to try.
I don't think BYTE ever had any trouble with exporting it -- but then,
I don't recall ever seeing crypto software in that form. (Carl
Helmers, one of the founders of BYTE, is on the net these days, and
might have useful input...)
Quoth tcmay at netcom.com:
Magnetic ink printing is done with MICR fonts (Magnetic Ink Character
Recognition, or something like that... Under version 10 of the X
Window System, there was a screen font based on MICR. Pretty ugly.)
The OCR fonts really are designed for OCR... I don't recall the
distinction between A and B, I think the latter actually has lower
case as well as upper case :-), but you can find an OCR font for
TeX/MetaFont in one of the standard places (archie CTAN if you don't
have a place to start from...) There are also print-wheels (remember
daisywheel printers?) for the font, and many of the Computer Output
Microfiche services from the 70's and 80's printed all microfiche in
one of the OCR fonts for easy future retrieval.
Anyone out there have experience with modern OCR systems (not the
highest tech Kurzweil units, but something your average hacker could
get cheap for his PC or Mac) and know if OCR fonts are even worth the
trouble these days? I'd guess that a good monospace Courier font would
be just as readable to modern scanners.
After all, Dr. Dobbs (April 1994) has listings for Blowfish encryption
code, in C, in about a 6pt Courier font; I note, however, that they
also have them up for ftp (ftp://ftp.mv.com/pub/ddj/1994.04/blowfish.asc)
so perhaps it doesn't matter how easy it is to scan.

A couple of years ago, IEEE Spectrum did an article which took the
premise that spy-satellite optics could be made that were as good as
the Hubble Space Telescope optics (for various reasons, pointing
Hubble at the earth "just wouldn't work" :-) They came up with some
number like "1 foot resolution" -- and then did some processing on a
photograph to demonstrate what that meant. The picture used was a rear view of a VW Bug, with a copy of Isvestia
resting on the upper edge of the trunk. Basically, you could tell
there was something sitting there, but you couldn't read the headlines
:-) Unfortunately, my library is at the moment unindexed, due to a recent
move, or I'd include a reference to the article; perhaps someone else
here saw it... it covers the physics involved rather well, and lists a

@_subject: RATINGS: strn has the right features (was Subject tags) 
Strn has a couple of unrelated but relevant features. The virtual
newsgroups, as discussed, are a lot more powerful than you'd think --
in fact, they could be ideal for the Ratings system. Virtual
newsgroups can be constructed from arbitrary lists of message-id's...
the intent, I think, was to use nngrep and such to supply them, but
you could just as easily use the result of post-processing your
ratings-list to generate them. (Virtual newsgroups can be constructed
from a number of sources, actually, both "live" and with
On *top* of that (ie. at the reader's side of the system, regardless
of whether the group is real or virtual) you have a scoring system,
which is based on applying regular expression patterns to messages,
and producing scores. (For example, I read comp.sys.palmtops because I
have an hp100, so I have a positive score for subject:.*hp100, but I'm
also interested in new things that might show up there, but I know I
*don't* care about the Tandy Zoomer, so /zoomer/ gets a negative
score.) Scores are cumulative on an article. Since strn is built on
trn, if a score gets you to read an article mid-thread, you can easily
move around in the 2d representation of the thread, even if those
items didn't score as well.
I think it has the flexibility to implement most, if not all, of what
you want your ratings system to provide.  (Pedantic point -- would it
not be more correct to say that *you* have social goals, not the
rating system -- the system is merely your tool...)
strn works quite will with a local news spool, and is supposed to work
with an XOVER database (or whatever the other equivalent was) if
you're using NNTP.

@_subject: remailer multiple paths? 
Is there any value to the idea of breaking up a message and sending
the parts of it by different "remailer paths" to the ultimate
recipient? Shouldn't this reduce the risk of remailer compromise as
much or more than simply nesting remailers?
You'd need a good way of breaking up the message; if you were
encrypting already, it'd probably do well enough to put byte x into
message (x mod n) where you're sending n messages. (You could even
slice it at the bit level, but that's a little harder to do in a
trivial script...) Or would you? is breaking up the message at all good enough, or is it
necessary that "nothing of value" can be produced from the pieces?
Haven't thought this through, but perhaps others here have. (The
concept could even be used with an anonymous pool, sort of a "collect
the whole set!" type of reading mechanism...)
It could be argued that the various binary.pictures groups are already
run this way :-)

I never did contact the author, but the stereogram code on soda had
one major byte-order dependencies in the file format -- I cheated and
just used emacs to twiddle the first four bytes of each of the data
files, and was able to get it to work (nice thing about having a sun
3/50 at home -- 19" monochrome monitor that works *great* for
these...) under linux. I've also seen code to generate ascii
stereograms, but don't have it online (yes, I only saw it on paper)
and don't have permission to post it in any case. The algorithm is
simple, though, and the program could be done as a short perl script...
I've never been clear on where to hide the data, though -- in the
random background pattern? in something that is visible at a certain
separation distance? (a friend had the admittedly odd suggestion of
hiding one stereogram in another, by having the image you see with
crossed eyes be a random dot pattern itself...)

and I digress wildly:
Mid-November, 1988, after the great Morris Worm Stomp[1], a bunch of
people who'd helped hunt the Worm were invited to the NCSC[2] to give
talks at a "Post-Mortem", as it were. The MIT and Berkeley crowds had
the most real technical data on it[3], though at least one of the
government labs had done a fair job at decompiling it.
The relevant part was that while the NCSC didn't have much useful info
on the Worm itself[4] they had *categorized* it, and among their
spiffy color slides, they had a "taxonomy" slide which surprised me by
including Brunner's worm. The NCSC seems to officially credit Brunner
as the first literature reference to the idea...

That's just because it was an intuitive, but excruciatingly
inefficient, implementation. You can do towers of hanoi with *no*
stack, as long as you can loop (and even if you can't explicitly loop,
you can do it tail recursively, which this version isn't, and still
avoid using stack.) It's much harder to recognize that the code
relates to the problem... but if you treat the problem as "generate
this stream of numbers" it's not too hard to see how to do it.
The story behind the original "towers of hanoi" problem (three ivory
rods, 64 gold and silver disks) is amusing, though, in that it's an
example of using an "intractable" problem (moving the 64 rings by the
proper rules -- only stack on the immediate smaller size, only move
one at a time, and get the whole pile moved) to protect a "secret" (as
I've heard it, the world would be destroyed (or saved?) when the
operation was finished... perhaps the "secret" would be that it wasn't
