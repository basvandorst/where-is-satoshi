wooohoooo!" like this one, from sweet mary, that she left on the clean room post: "Your house seems so organized. the ms craft dept was featured in an article, and their personal crafting projects were shown. 3. i think that packages stacked all over the house are a nice decorative touch (and they remind me how good people are to donate to project 31) happy things! i mean, look at her hair.
