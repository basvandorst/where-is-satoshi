NEWS RELEASE       2 June 2001 We have experienced undue delays in industrialising the production for the HP4100 and HP2000C (also HP2200C / HP2500C).
This is mainly because we have had to encapsulate our HP4100 design in an electronic resin shell. Also there are other highly technological materials that we required from Europe in order to complete the process.
We have invested heavily in the production and this delay of a few weeks will only benefit you later as we have managed to save considerably on production costs by adapting our methods.
We are still hopeful that we will release the solution in 7 days. Resetting (docking booths) will release two weeks after this. The delay on this is because we have had to farm-out the actual manufacture of the wafer board. The chip (non-encapsulated) is so small that we simply do not have the machinery and electronic manufacturing line to produce these on. This is really hi-tech and involved the actual design and manufacture of a wafer board that is around 1cm x 1cm. We are still hopeful that we will release the solution in 10 days. Resetting (docking booths) will release at same time.
Chips are in stock and are selling well. We have put the release of the resetting machine on a back-burner as a result of prioritising towards the HP4100 and HP2000C release. These machines will however be available in a month's time.
RESETTING HP4100 CHIPS IN THE INTERIM
HERE'S SOME RELIEF.........................Because of the delays you have experienced in the wait, we are happy to offer resets from South Africa.
We are glad to receive your removed HP4100 chips for resetting at our South African offices. We will charge a paltry US$7 for this service as an apology for the delays. Bear in mind that you will require to pay the freight both ways, however this will be fairly inexpensive.
What we need you to follow in this process: -
* Remove chip from each cartridge
* Leave the chip in its encapsulation (DO NOT REMOVE or OPEN THIS)
* Specifically mark the SERIAL NUMBER of the cartridge and tag this to each chip individually. This is very important. We recommend you use a sticker.
* The chip is quite robust in the encapsulation so you need only ship these in a FEDEX or similar box in wrapping
* We can offer a turnaround time per lots of 200 in 24 hours, but safely work on 48 hours
* The delivery address is: 47 PEACE ROAD, KLOOF, 3610, KWA-ZULU NATAL, REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA. ~ OR ~ you can ship via our US offices for convenience, who will handle shipping on your behalf
* All billing will be done ex Chicago and there is no need to pay the RSA office
* We prefer FEDEX rather than other couriers
* Please ensure you list your INTERNATIONAL: ACCOUNT NUMBER for return courier mail
* The product code is EI-HP4100RS1 (Edje Imaging - HP4100 Reset 1)
We are selling the XEROX N24/32/40 chip solutions and are happy to "bargain" on price as we are VERY late to market. The only reason we are doing these is out of demand.
LEXMARK (FT-PRS)
We are still selling these in huge numbers. Please enquire for your new orders.
TOSHIBA, VERITEK, QMS, UNISYS
We are happy to make up special chip orders for you on these makes. This pertains to Lexmark OEM-partners using the PREBATE lockout chips. These are different from Lexmark in regard to unique coding so we would require your chip samples to read, during manufacture.
We look forward to your requests and orders. Should you have queries, please feel free to contact our offices.
