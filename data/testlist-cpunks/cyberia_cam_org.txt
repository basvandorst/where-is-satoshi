for minors to look at pornography.

that little rd command? What others are there? I've seen < and > in
use, what do they perform?

of a hundred needs to be killed no matter what happens to the lives of the
other 99? Give me a break, we're not living in the 1800's anymore, we want
to STOP wars, not create them!
weapons in the former Soviet Union are probably not even owned by the
government, some are probably owned by private individuals. Secondly, the
former Soviet Union would never give up all their chem. weapons for the
same reason, that the U.S.A would not give up theirs (they'd be left
defenseless, or very open).

account to access it. Most ISP's like AOL, CompuServe, Prodigy, and others
don't offer that. They'd also have to set it up through a communications
program in DOS. Anyways, if you're NOT talking about Lynx, what DOS-based
Web browser is there?

some Islamic militants decide to kill a few people in a terrorist attack
does not mean that the entire believer population of Islam does not have
respect for life. Just who is "we"? Americans? Europeans? All
industrialized nations? Every country except those Third World ones? Uh...
I don't see your point very clearly here... The only culture I can think
of that might now have respect for life are cannibals, and they DO have
respect for life in a way, they don't kill each other (I don't think), and
they do it because it's their lifestyle, but they don't perform
cannibalistic acts out of malice. Correct me here if I'm wrong.

alt.2600 FAQ beta version 0.13. That in itself is available at my FTP site
ftp.cam.org /users/cyberia. The English language is 450,000 words in its
entirety, not including (I believe) proper names. So the file you're
looking for (if it exists) would be very large. Good luck.
