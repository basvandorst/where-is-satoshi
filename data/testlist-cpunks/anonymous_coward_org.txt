@_subject: Hillary style health plan to save US 
YES, you are. The aims don't justify the means (initiatory-force regulation
of healthcare which is what will happen). Besides that you're not going to
reach the aims anyways. Look at what is happening on europe: all
insurances are forced on the government standard -- politicians dictate
what medicine should be used, prohibiting expensive and alternative
products and therapies. The REAL price ultimately includes governmentalisation and bureauratization of practiced medicine. People
have to pay more and more for public healthcare tax because the public
insurance (and the gov's healthcare standard to which all insurances
have to adhere) isn't rentable.
Public healthcare was Hillary's masterpiece of economic destruction
back then. Be happy that it didn't come to it. Please don't fall for
those lawyer-type destructions and antiindivdualistic intrusions for
Mrs C's often-cited, very own "social good".
