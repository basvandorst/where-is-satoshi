@_subject: Joe Sixpack and his TV 
If Mr. & Mrs J. Sixpack seem to know zilch at present about strong or any other other kind of crypto, would it maybe, possibly have to do with a lack
of exposure to it on the soap operas of their favorite media, ie TV? Hmmm.
The general level of paranoia on X-Files (100 milion viewers all over the world, rabid internet following) is even higher than on this list, and the usual discussions on this list would read like a free vacation to their
scriptwriters and researchers. Anyone have any scriptwriting skills?
100 million potential subscribers to toad are stake... (Yes I guess then
we'd have to move to usenet distribution. But think how entertaining our
flames wars would become. Yes I'm definitely calling for it, and the big house with the hot tub would be nice too. Only half joking. Honestly though, anyone want to find out their email addreses and send out a gratis subscription to toad? A script would be nice too. It's better exposure than five seconds of Tim with Connie Chung.)

And from what the folks at the Export Controls division of the Department of External Affairs in Ottawa told me, Canadians can't export export-controlled American software, including pgp and other freeware, without a license. OTOH we can export non-US=origin software license-free
(well freeware for sure, anyway, I didn't get the whole thing quite right). Of course there are a few countries for which you would need a license,
and some UN embargoed countries to which you can't make any exports (both sets are dictatorships or warzones, so not much net access anyway and the crypto laws would make France's look cpunk).
They're also waiting to see what happens to Phil Z. to decide whether or not
ftp's are exports. All the same, if anyone wants an easy and economical
way to get around ITAR, have someone do your cypto software development just north of the border (Vancouver's just north of Seattle and close enough to Silicon Valley, with excellent net-access) or at least just
publish it here first. Phil could have saved himself an immense amount of trouble with a short car ride. You Americans on the list could too.
Wanna nag your bosses some more Jeff? You'd be doing everyone a favor and
get your wish.

@_subject: FROM A FRIEND . . . (or the joys of boating) 
*Loud* chuckles. Who says you have to *own* the boat? (haha) A suitably
paid Canadian boat-captain could easily testify that you arrived every day
to the boat with your trusty laptop, to develop your software within Canada.
The disk with your saved code on it never left the boat. When you finished your development, you used a borrowed satellite phone to call up
your ISP in Canada (we're talking physical Canada, not virtual, maritime, and
bullshit Canada) to post your code and uuencoded executables to sci.cript,
and alt.test. And since you used a satellite phone, for the modem transmission, no US phone lines were used (a cellphone wouldn't do). Of course you wouldn't actually have to do any of this. The gentleman just
has to say it in court. The truth, the whole truth and nothing but.
