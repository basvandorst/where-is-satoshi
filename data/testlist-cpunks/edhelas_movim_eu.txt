It's always good to see that people are working on tools to protect privacy and open the sourcecode. But i'm a bit disapointed by your approach which is for me a "already seen" centralized encrypted chat.
I trully think that we need to do more than reinvent the wheel and build several chat clients that are not compatible between them. We just need to work on standard, decentralized protocols (like XMPP) ad implemented them properly in nice clients.
By using a universal standard the users will be able to choose between several solutions which are all compatibles. All theses clients are implemented using several languages on several platforms too.
There's already a bunch of tools in XMPP to do that, we are just waiting for nice clients :)
P.S.: I'm working on XMPP for a couple of years now

Hi everyone,
I'm working on the Movim project since 2008, our aim is to create a full social network on top of the XMPP protocol. As I see again, the guys of the Tox project are trying to reinvent the wheel… again. Now, to do IM, we have Skype, BBM, Line, WhatsApp, MSN, QQ, AIM, ICQ, IRC, XMPP, Facebook Messenger…
Same for the social networks as Davis said (PumpIO, TentIO…)
I really think that we need to focus on an existent standard and improve it, and for me XMPP seem to be the perfect protocol for all theses things :
- Standard IM + chatroom
- Video/Audio conferencing (with Jingle, we are using it with WebRTC on - Pubsub (for newsfeeds, blogging)
- Geolocation
- Vcard4 support
- SASL2 authentication
- OTR support
- Full encryption between the servers (
- and so on…
XMPP can do a lot more than just IM, it's a full social-communication protocol it just need to be implemented, tested and debugged :)

Hi Davis,
Thank you very much for this awesome feedback, having constructives criticizes like this helps me a lot :) I'll try to explain my choices for some of them.
I agree with your first comment, there's clearly a lack of communication. But, I'm currently working on the 0.8 release and on a fundraising (on Kickstarter) before the end of summer. I'll create a thread on Reddit and talk about it theses next couple of weeks ;)
For the video, I don't have skills to do a nice looking one. But if you have tips, do not hesitate to share them with me.
For PHP, the choice was made a couple of years ago and the aim was to install Movim on quite all the servers (I love Ruby on Rails but deploying a RoR application can be quite difficult for some administrators). We also tried to built Movim on top of differents PHP frameworks (Zend, Symfony and more recently Laravel).
The thing is that Movim works in a really special way (the connexion is kept open with the XMPP server using BOSH threw long polling requests so I have to do session synchronisation en prevent session-lock… all in PHP) so it cannot be ported easily on a "classical MVC" framework. We also use our own internal widget system with event handling (when a specific XMPP stanza is handled).
I'll take a look at the sanitizer.rb file and try to find a proper way to sanitize the strings, maybe use an external library for that ;)
Having a public/ folder is also planned for the 1.0 version but I need to refactor a couple of stuffs in the app to make it works properly.
I'm also using the PSR standard ( especially for the library loading (using composer) and the logger. I've already moved parts of Movim to independant libraries to modularize the project I'm trying to move from Bazaar to Git but I mave a couple of issues when I convert the commit-history tree. Also I'm looking for a proper way to handle the internationalisation (Launchpad has a ship-in system for that).
We are also one of the most advanced XMPP client, with a really nice implementation of the standard (all the currently implemented XEP are listed here :  I'm working with the XMPP Standard Fundation to standardise and improve the XMPP protocol.
Thanks again !

Hi !
That's a great new ! I'm always happy to see new XMPP servers instance. Prosody is a great choice. With the Movim we are building a social network on top of the XMPP protocol and we are using Metronome, a fork of prosody with some fix and great features (full Pubsub/PEP support If you are interested to set-up a Movim instance on one (or both !) of your servers, do not hesitate to mail me (or via XMPP, my JID is the same as my email adress ;)). I'm also looking for new independant pods in The Netherlands, most of the Movim instances are currently hosted in France (

I can resume this fragmentation issue by a simple sentence that I'm saying more and more these days : "If you have a problem, do not write an API, write a protocol".
The social federation protocol is already here : it's XMPP. And yes it can support everything a social network has to offer (feeds, subscriptions, profiles, contact list…). There is already millions of users on the XMPP network, and you can easily find several clients on all the plateforms for it.
I'm working since 2008 on the Movim project ( to build a full, good looking, "decentralized" (federated) and open source social network on XMPP. And believe me, yes it's possible.
I like the link that the guy made in the presentation with Firefox. Why Firefox surpassed IE ? Because they just choose to implement the W3C standards and try to improve it (and they offer some nice features too).
Diaspora, GNU Social, Friendica are not trying to do that, they create their own "proprietary" protocol to talk between each other and after that face the same issues than all the others network : "Hey, we are not compatibles ! Lets create an API and the other networks will be compatible with us".
So keep calm and implement XMPP ;)

Well, thanks :)
It's possible to push it forward and try to not reinvent the wheel again and again by creating a new protocol.
Ok, the term "proprietary" was a little strong. Of course the sourcecode of theses projects is open. But can you give me any serious documentations (more than a Wiki or some ML links) that can help me to implement properly the Diaspora/Friendica/GNU Social protocols like RFC, IETF stuffs ?
A protocol have to be stable in the time, most of theses project just create their own protocol from their need. The Diaspora protocol was re-written already one time (which totally broke the Friendica compatibility at this time), the guys from Status.net moved to No, they wrote their own protocol for their own project, and someone just try to implement it to try to be compatible. But it's a one way work, the guys from Diaspora will not adapt their protocol to help the guys from Friendica/GNU Social/whatever.
What is your plan with The Federation ? To build a project to help all theses project to talk each others and find a way to "standardize" the communications between them to be compatible with eachothers ?
Then you will define some basic schema of authentication/packet format (JSON/HTML/XML…)/global architecture…
In the end it will looks like this : If your aim is to ask theses project to have a public API to share stuffs between their different servers, well good luck.
No, but I prefer to contribute and improve a 15 years old protocol, with millions of users and hundred of implementations, managed by a strong Fundation that works with the IETF than on a 4 yo protocol implented by ~2 project where all the documentation you can find on it is here
