---- 8< snip
You are using Viacrypt PGP, which has a release out which fixes the comment "feature" - contact them for an upgrade.
This was fixed in the freeware version some time ago as well.

I have found and reported to the anonymizer that it does not always protect you against perl-based cgi scripts.  I did this by accessing a form-based email page (based on Matt's script) which includes environment variable values in the msg to the recipient.  I didn't receive any response back from them after I emailed them the info.

@_subject: Is there a Win PGP? 
I have both versions.  They call it the "Business Edition", and the master
key is optional, not required.  The master key has to be in place before
anyone else generates their key, otherwise the master key won't work.  You
have to go in and turn this on so it isn't something that gets implemented
without *someone* knowing.  As for everyone else knowing that there was a
master key generated...

In light of recent claims,i would like somebody to clear this up for me.
There seems to be a great deal of conjecture over wether or not the Deeyenda Virus exhists.
Symantec denies it's existence,although i hear differently??
Greatly appreciate anyone who can shed some light on the subject,even though C-punks list doesnt usually deal with this topic of thought ;)
Anyone come across the pkz300 trojan,if you have it send it please.
A student,a paper,and a possible future career are at stake here,so please dig deep into your pockets!!!!!! Asking a lot i know!

If you know a valid email address on the spammers system you can always bounce each message back to them.  If enough people turned the messages back on them it might give them the opportunity to experience first hand what its like to receive tons of mail you don't want or need...

And then there are the network headers - you can usually see where the msg entered the net.  These people aren't usually clever enough to spoof the headers beyond the from and reply to fields.
