So this is the kind of thing I was talking about -- it just moves
things to the next obvious escalation from which there is no
obvious way to go further down this dead end route of trace,
block, track down and prosecute, etc.
So what if you couldn't send a packet without revealing a
source address.  There are numerous ways to reveal someone
else's source address, which is a real source address, just
not yours.
I'm not even sure it's a step forward to paint yourself
into a corner where there is no way to fix the induced
escalation of attack sophistication.

References: <20010207102551.L30304 I wonder if they're using PGP stealth 2 that I contributed to
based on Henry Hastur's 1.  It's kind of interesting to see
these things used in the field.
However one suspects unless they had some hired security
consultants it may be that they just used the stego
programs such as Andy Brown's or Romano's stego program with
raw messages.  Or perhaps using PGP without PGP stealth.
Also you've got to wonder if the whole thing is some
spook public opnion manipulation attempt.  And then
there's the question of how they found out.  Did they
get a tip-off and find the person stegoing the messages
into the porn?  Or was the stego not that well done and
the result didn't provide plausible deniability, so they
could remotely confirm their informant based suspicions.

Coincidentally, or perhaps not given my recent comments about
the dumbness of tracing and blocking as a strategy, someone appears to be syn flooding my cable modem right now.  Tons
of TCP connections from a bank of IP addresses slowly changing.
