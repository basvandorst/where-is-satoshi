After the latest monthly automatic updates for Windows XP,
I got the following message on my screen:
  Data Execution Prevention: Microsoft Windows
  To help protect you computer, Windows has closed this program.
  Name: Windows Explorer
  Publisher: Microsoft Corporation
  Data Execution Prevention helps protect against damage from viruses
  and other security threats.   What should I do?
                                ----------------
