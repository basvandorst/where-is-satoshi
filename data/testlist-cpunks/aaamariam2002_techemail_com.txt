DEAR SIR,
I am MRS MARIAM ABACHA, wife of the late Nigerian
Head of State, General Sani Abacha who died on the 8th
of June 1998 while still on active duty. I am
contacting you in view of the fact that we will be of
great assistance to each other likewise developing a
cordial relationship.
I currently have within my reach the sum of six million United States Dollars (US$36,000,000) in
cash, which I intend to use for investment specifically in your country. This money came as a
result of a payback contract deal between my husband and a Russian firm on our country's
Multi-Billion Dollars Ajaokuta Steel Plant. The
Russian partners returned my husbands share of
US$36,000,000 after his death and lodge it with late husband's security company in Nigeria of which I
am a director. Right now the new civilian have intensified their probe on my husband's resources and they have revoked our licenses allows us to own a financial and oil company. In view
of this, I acted very fast to withdraw the
US$36,000,000 from the company's vault and it in a privately erected security safe abroad.
No record ever existed concerning the money neither is
the money traceable by the Government because there is
no documentation showing that we received the from the Russians.
Due to the current situation in the country Government attitude towards my family, it has quite impossible for me to make use of this within, thus I seek assistance to transfer this into your safe bank account. On your consent, I shall expect
you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss
details of this transaction.
Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed transfer the funds, I propose a commission of 20% of
the total sum to you for the expected services assistance. Your urgent response is highly needed so
as to stop further contacts. all correspondent should be forwarded to this EMAIL:zenab.m at ompadec.zzn.con
or you can call my son mobile:hamza   234-8023137978 I  use this opportunity to implore you to exercise the most indulgence to keep this matter extra ordinarily
confidential what ever your decision while I await your
