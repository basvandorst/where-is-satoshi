@_subject: chip-0.1 / driver for MARALU chip-card-reader/writer v1.0 
I have placed chip-0.1.tgz on
  ftp.thp.uni-koeln.de(134.95.64.1):/pub/linux/chip/chip-0.1.tgz
It contains an alpha version of a rudimentary loadable device driver
and a sample application (get information out of the telephone cards
used by the German Telekom) to be used with MARALU's chip-card-reader/writer.
In principal, the reader/writer should be able to access all types of
I2C-cards and other formats.
I'll try to provide more functionality if there's interest in the net.
Please mail comments, suggestions and questions to chip at thp.uni-koeln.de.
If you don't have ftp-access, drop me a note and I'll mail the code to
you (in uuencoded form (about 8k), if nothing different is specified).
PLEASE NOTE, THAT NEITHER I NOR MARALU TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE
FUNCTIONALITY OR RELIABILITY OF THE PROVIDED CODE AND INFORMATION.
Mail submissions for comp.os.linux.announce to: linux-announce at tc.cornell.edu
Be sure to include Keywords: and a short description of your software.
