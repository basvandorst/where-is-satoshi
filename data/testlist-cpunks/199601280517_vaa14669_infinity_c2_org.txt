@_subject: PIDAHO and EUDORA PRO 2.2 
In response to the "what has John Doe got that PIDAHO doesn't" messages I tried to
PIDAHO v2.6b.  I am unable to make it work.  Messages from PIDAHO can not be sent to
the selected and OnLine EUDORA PRO application.  I also suspect that it has something to do with the fact  PIDAHO is a 16bit app and EUDORA PRO v2.2 is 32bit.  I am running it on a WIN95 internal tcp/ip stack to a dial up ppp connection.
Any help and or advice would be sincerely appreciated.
