@_subject: Looking for Hackers' Story 
I am looking for the sources about the general aspects of the
hackers. I am writing an article for a Korean journal .
I am writing about the origins, the history, the developments,
the new trends, and its impact on the industry, etc.
Please send me an e-mail if you know any good sources.
Thanks in advance.

@_subject: 16 years old hacker arrested ? 
According to AFP(London), The Independent reported on January 3, 1995
that a sixteen years old boy was arrested for breaking into the computer network of US Defense Department.
The report also tells that the hacker posted documents about last
year's nuclear crisis between North Korea and USA.
Does anyone know where can I get a copy of that documents ?
