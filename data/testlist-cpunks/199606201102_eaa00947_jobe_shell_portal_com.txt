@_subject: FBI utters root passsword to the Constitution 
FBI InfoSec Guru Randy Perlman (Prilamen? Filament?) was interviewed on
CNN BizNews this morning by Deborah Marchini:  "Hackers" are menacing the net and society.  Marchini prompted him but he concurred:  Hackers are a *THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY*.  There you have it, the root password to the Constitution.  Illegal wiretapping, assassination, anything is now justified
in the defense of our NATIONAL INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE.
