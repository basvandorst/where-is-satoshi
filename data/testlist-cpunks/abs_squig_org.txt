Well, as an EFnet user, I can say that EFnet is pretty unreliable. Network
splits are extremely common (major splits occuring once every 3 or 4
hours, and usually lasting about 10 minutes or so). Lag between major irc
servers is often quite apparent. All-in-all, EFnet needs a lot of
work. Some of the other networks like Chatnet behave better, but they are
also smaller and have less users.
Is there a need for a new IRC network? Unclear. I think that the probolems
EFnet has are not going to be fixed by relacing it. The IRC servers simply
need to be more reliable.

Amusing. I commented to one of my classmates last week that it wasn't

someone reacted.
Since when is the use of "whois" illegal? Mapquest? Public DMV records?
Jim may be "invading the privacy" of these CIA agents, but if they have
been negligent enough to allow that information to become public, it's
their own fault.
I don't recall Jim advocating any action against said CIA installation. He
was just reporting public information, and making inquiries. No bombing
requests... not that anyone here would be really upset if such a thing

I have been thinking about the DMCA recently, in respect to the limited
ability granted to researchers for analysis of security protocols. I doubt we'll see a significant rise in the reverse engineering of
security protocols. We *will* see a rise in the use of anonymous remailers
to reveal vulnerabilities, but overall, I think that such research will
Would GSM have been broken if the researchers couldn't have taken credit
for it? Inside the NSA it would have been, surely. But where is the
incentive for private researchers to attack these protocols if they can't
take public credit for their work? The allowances that the DCMA makes for academic research is not sufficient
to continue to provide motivation for such research. Which is exactly what
the manufacturers want: security through obscurity, and obscurity through

Ah, but would you or I know that it had been broken? You've missed my
point, Choate. Public disclosure of security vulnerabilities happens
because of researchers and groups who work for recognition. If people cannot gain recognition for having broken a system, they will
not profit from revealing that said system is broken, unless perhaps they
are the developers of a competing system.
So, perhaps Sprint or AT&T or one of the CDMA/TDMA cell network providers
would have put researchers on the problem of breaking A5/1... but who else
would have had the motivation *and* would benefit from the public knowing
that it wasn't secure?
And besides, I think it would probably have been less legal for Sprint to
reverse-engineer GSM than the SDA/Berkeley folks.
So my point stands. Systems will still be broken, but will be broken by
the "bad guys" and the public will not be notified.

I'm sick of people complaining about whois. There is *no* verification of
the authenticity of the whois information. You can lie. You can give
555-1212 as your phone number. You can give post office boxes as your

If you're going to piss and moan about something, don't it something as
frivilous as whois. Let's look at health care plans, such as Cigna, that
require your SSN to be your member ID number, or something that's more
important than domain names.

I don't know who's more screwed up: the people who attempt cybersex with
your AI GWB, you for programming the AI to respond to people initiating
cybersex, or us for finding it fascinating that this occurs.
I had the opportunity several years ago to have dinner with author Gentry
Lee. We discussed the state of employment in the coming century if it
presented a future where automation was ubiquitous.
Lee hypothesized that less than 10% of the population would be employed at
any given time. All labor and services that could be done by machines and
computers would be. (This was about the time that NeXT Cubes were running
the NeXT manufacturing plant, and everyone found that so amazing...) The
intelligentsia would become the working class. Humans would only need to
"work" as architects of the automation system. People in these roles would
work for a small period of time, but spend most of their lives unemployed.
He predicted that the unemployed masses would spend their time in reality
simulation programs, living out fantasy lives. This had the benefit of
limiting the visible effects of overpopulation, crime, and other social
problems. He presented this as a utopian view of the future.
I disagreed for two main reasons. I didn't see it likely that 10% of the
world's population would be interested in working to support the other
90%, without receiving something in return. (_The Matrix_ was still a few
years from being released, so the thought of using people as a fuel source
hadn't occurred to me. I did suggest that perhaps a Soylent Green type
scenario might provide some justification for such a lop-sided burden
on this working minority, but not enough.) I don't recall that Lee had any
really solid answer to this argument. The other issue I had, and the one that applies to this thread, is that I
found it impossible to believe that AI personalities and VR environments
would have developed far enough to provide systems capable of passing the
Turing test [is there an equivalent test for VR systems? A user should
not be able to distinguish between VR and reality... ] and thus the 90%
of idle masses would not be content to be fed brain candy, rotting their
lives away in computer generated fantasies.
I'm becoming convinced that I was wrong. I've heard of people dropping out of college because they have spent too
much time on text-based MUDs. I've seen teenagers go into debt so that
they could spend most of their waking moments in the arcades.
And now, I've read a transcript of a person getting herself off through a
text conversation with a stateless program designed to emulate one of the
most boring presidential candidates in years.
People like this would be more than happy to embrace Lee's virtual reality
existence, and would be more than willing to exist on the donations
provided by the productive few. I doubt they would be motivated enough to
cause any trouble for this plan.
Our "human rights" measures are counteracting the natural protections
against laziness and stupidity. The human species is in trouble if people
like "User" breed. God, I hate welfare.

I think this is a bit overly broad. (Declan's statement was in reference
to "a show of force" which is what I think you are onjecting to here. With
that, I totally agree.) One should never use violence to instill fear; in
fact, instilling fear in an animal is simply a bad idea.
But, with higher intelligence animals such as dogs, you may find it
unavoidable. I've come home to find my dog slinking around the house,
avoiding eye-contact with me, and generally looking scared and
guilty. (Then I discover my slippers gnawed on or the trash turned over.)
I've never struck her. I rarely yell at her. She is, however, afraid of
making me mad.
It's all in how you want to structure your training of the animal. The
positive reinforcement approach requires more patience and time initially,
but the results are much better than if you use punishment.

As in my previous message, it depends on how you're defining fear in this
application. Can a dog not fear disappointing its owner?
With that, I agree.
I was always told that the only form of physical admonishment one should
ever employ with a dog is a swift jerk at the scruff of the neck
(apparently imitating mother/puppy behavior). I don't particularly see
this being useful, however. The urge to react physically to undesirable
behavior is a failing in the human trainer. (Likewise, when your child
accidently steps on your dog's tail, you want the dog to yelp rather than
[snip accurate description of the ordeal of housebreaking dogs]
One method that has worked for me, in addition to everything you've said,
is the repetition of a phrase while waiting for the dog to do his
business. I've spent many a night standing in my back yard saying
"hurry-up" in the sweetest voice imaginable to my puppies, and then
telling them how much of a good dog they are when they pee. Makes the
neighbors think I am batty, but they eventually equate "hurry-up" with
"take a leak", and I can get them to urinate on command.
"If you point at a dog, he'll look at your finger..."
Jim, most people on here won't know what an alpha roll is.
By extension, if you're ever in a situation where you fear you may be
attacked by a dog, avert your eyes. A staring contest with a strange
dog may end up with bloodshed.
