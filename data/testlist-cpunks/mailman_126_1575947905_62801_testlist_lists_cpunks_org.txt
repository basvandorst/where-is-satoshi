@_subject: html code for simple application/join form? 
Dear Subscribers,
I have a question that is hindering my online progress and success.
I have been trying to build my own webpage with a simple application form with inputs of First Name, Last Name Email Address and a click "submit" button. I have an email account on the same free web site provider and my own email account.  The application form is to be submitted either to my mail box on the same website or to my own email box. How to write and create the html codes for this simple application form?
I enclose below the html codes for form, I will appreciate very much if you could kindly advise,  comment and pick out the mistakes or make due corrections or amendments. All coding is between '[' and ']' instead of the less than and greater than signs to avoid any conflict in the newsletter.
[FORM ACTION= method=POST] [input type=hidden name="mail_to" value="your email address"]
[input type=hidden name="subject" value=
      "I would like to join your program for free!"]
[input type=hidden name="required" value="firstname,lastname,email"]
[table][tr][tr][td ALIGN=RIGHT][i]Frist name[/i]
[td][input] type="text" size="25" name="firstname"][/td][/tr][/tr]
[tr][td][td ALIGN=RIGHT][i]Last name[/i][/td][td][input type="text"
size="25" name="lastname"][/td][/tr][/tr]
[tr][tr][td ALIGN=RIGHT][i]Email Address[/i][/td][/td][input type="text"
size="25" name="email"][/td][/tr]/tr]
[tr][td ALIGN=RIGHT][i][/i][/td][/td][/tr]
[center][input type="SUBMIT" value="Join for Free"][/form]
Thank you. Best regards.
