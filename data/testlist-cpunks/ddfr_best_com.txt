@_subject: "Contempt" charges likely to increase 
Last semester I taught a seminar on computers, crime, and privacy and we
had, as a guest lecturer one evening, Silicon Valley's one full time
computer cop (he works for the SC County D.A.'s office). One of his
comments was that ISP's were generally very cooperative, because they knew
that he could legally impose large costs on them by seizing their systems
as evidence.

Have you read _The Hacker Crackdown_? I think it is pretty clear that part
of what was going on there involved law enforcement people deliberately
punishing BBS operators for behavior that was wicked but not
illegal--basically facilitating communications involved in committing
crimes (credit card number theft and the like). The punishment consisted of
seizing the computer and backups and holding it for a year or so as
"evidence"--without ever filing charges.
Conceivably the owner could have taken legal action--but doing so would
give the law enforcement people an incentive to file charges, thus imposing
large costs on the owner even if he was innocent of any crime and could
eventually prove it.
I suspect that a good deal of this goes on in most law enforcement systems,
in one form or another. Charging and convicting people is costly, even if
they are guilty--and there is often behavior that law enforcement people
want to prevent that is not even illegal. On the other hand, there are lots
of things police can do that impose sizable costs but do not require a
conviction, such as arresting you, holding you in a cell overnight, but
never actually trying you for anything.

Or, as Adam Smith put it:
"but after twelve or thirteen years of age, provided the master does his
duty, force or restraint can scarce ever be necessary to carry on any part
of education."
"No discipline is ever requisite to force attendance upon lectures which
are really worth the attending, as is well known wherever such lectures are

P.S. sorry to be so late--I just came across this post.
