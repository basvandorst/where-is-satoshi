According to Bartlett's, this is attributed to Martin Niemoeller (1892-1984):
    In Germany they came first for the Communists, and I didn't speak up
    because I wasn't a Communist. Then they came for the Jews, and I
    didn't speak up because I wasn't a Jew. Then they came for the
    trade unionists, and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a trade
    unionist. Then they came for the Catholics, and I didn't speak
    up because I was a Protestant. Then they came for me, and by
    that time no one was left to speak up. [John Bartlett, _Familiar
    Quotations_, ed. by Justin Kaplan (16th ed.; Boston: Little, Brown and
    Company; 1992), p. 684]

@_subject: Waiting for Mac version [was Re: Full strength Email Clients] 
I agree completely about the need.  PGP, Inc., does claim to be working on
a Mac version, but their promises are beginning to sound a little hollow.
They now promise a "1997 release of PGPmail for the Macintosh" and "more
specific information on when PGPmail will be available on the Macintosh"
"during the second half of February."
I bought ViaCrypt PGP for Macintosh 2.7.1 in October.  (2.7.1 is nearly
identical to the free 2.6.2, with the same abysmal user interface that
earned a rare one-star rating from Macworld
, but 2.7.1
is licensed for commercial use.)  At the time, PGP Inc. promised a free
upgrade to version 4.0 for Mac, which was already considerably overdue.
(According to , 4.0 is still
"To Be Released Soon.")
When PGP, Inc., announced PGPmail 4.5 in December
, they wrote "PGPmail 4.5 ...
supports ... Mac OS."  I called and asked if this implied they were
bypassing 4.0 for Mac and when 4.5 would be available for Mac.  The support
person didn't know, said she'd find out and call me back, and never called
A few days ago, I received this via US mail:
We shall see.
Meanwhile, a beta version of "Pretty Safe Mail"
 is available from
Highware in Belgium.  It's PGP compatible, and its user interface is a
great leap forward from any Mac PGP front end I've seen.  But, it still has
some deficiencies, it's very slow (25 seconds to sign this message on a 25
MHz 68040 vs. 4 seconds for ViaCrypt PGP 2.7.1), and (as was recently
discussed on a couple of these lists) its source code hasn't been published
or externally audited.

Thanks for the pointer.
Note that, unlike the previous three recipients of crypto export licenses,
Open Market did not enable government access to keys.  Instead they went
through the "expensive ... exercise" of convincing "government officials
that the product could not be used to encrypt anything but specific
financial numbers."
