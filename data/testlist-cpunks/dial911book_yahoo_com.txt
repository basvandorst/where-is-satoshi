Dear Colleagues,
The July 2001 Issue of NRA's America's First Freedom
magazine featured a cover picture of John Ashcroft and
highlighted the story of Ashcroft's letter indicating
that "the Constitution protects the private ownership
of firearms for lawful purposes."  The magazine (at
pp. 35-37) exults in the reversal of Justice
Department policy on the Second Amendment.
That's great.  On page 37, the NRA reprints Ashcroft's
letter -- as though it were *in full* -- but omits the
footnote that exists in Ashcroft's actual letter.
As you know, Ashcroft also said in that footnote in
his letter that the Constitution "does not prohibit
Congress from enacting laws restricting firearms
ownership for compelling state interests, such as
prohibiting firearms ownership by convicted felons."
The NRA omitted a key element of Ashcroft's position

@_subject: Mr. Wienke, help me out on this -- Re: FW: General Ashcroft make his move 
Mr. Wienke, I paged through the entire July 2001 issue of American
Rifleman, and maybe I'm just blind as the proverbial
bat, but I don't see the article to which you refer
that quotes the entire Ashcroft letter.  On what page
is it?
The July 2001 issue of First Freedom is the one
featuring the Ashcroft letter -- that I have received
thus far.
On the point you raise:  maybe it was merely a bad
editorial decision for the one magazine.  Fine, and we
can forgive that.  But, ask this question:  in what
kind of workplace environment could this kind of
editing decision be made?  Remember that more than one editor had to approve the
final copy. This is not just a typo.  More than one
person had to consciously decide to omit relevant
material without telling the reader.  I have to wonder if other sorts of "editing decisions"
that massage the facts and distort the truth are being
made ... and we readers don't know it.  Maybe it was entirely innocent.  Then NRA should
promptly apologize, correct it and publish the full
text in the following issue.  Let's see if they do.  --Richard Stevens

Mr. Wienke,
Please -- I don't need a copy of the page -- I
subscribe to the magazine and have the July 2001 issue
in my possession. Just give me the page number where that material might
be found in the American Rifleman.
