@_subject: PGP26A is out 
A file has appeared here called PGP26A.ZIP.  The readme file claims
this version "fixes all known bugs" in the 2.6 version.  I'm very   The file does not contain any viruses that I can detect, or have any
obvious functionality problems.    The pgp.exe file is signed by the key "Rebellious Guerrilla ".
Source files are not included.
  The rebel key is not signed by any other keys.
  Does anyone here have any info on this "release"?
  Thanks, Dave Hodgins.

Hi all,
   This is just to inform anyone responding to my message about PGP 2.6,
that I've been unable to access my normal source, for copies of messages
from the list, since last Friday.  I've left a message asking CRSO to
look into this, and have sent a subscribe message from my work id, but
I doubt I'll see any messages from before my subscription gets processed.
   Is there any way to obtain a copy of all of the messages since last
   Please email me with any responses.
   BTW, I've sent a message to the person at MIT who informed me about
2.6, asking him if it's ok if I post a copy of his message to the list.
If he approves (and I haven't seen any similar messages posted by then),
I'll post it.
   Thanks, Dave Hodgins.

For any other Canrem.com members reading this, I've uploaded a file
called PGP26INF.ZIP, that contains a copy of all files that can be
downloaded from net-dist.mit.edu, without recognition as a Canadian,
or U.S. Site.
  Regards, Dave Hodgins.

@_subject: The only? CRS cypberpunk? 
Am I the only subscriber of crs, that is interested in privacy?
   Over the last few months, when the addressee list got wiped, I seemed to be the only person complaining, about the lack of message traffic. (Thanks to the volume of the conferences I pick up, it took  me over a week to notice the first time the list got wiped).  I've made a point of uploading privacy orientated software, such as the latest versions of pgp, sfs, secure drive, secure device, to crs, when I've found such things, primarily through this list.
  Am I the only person on crs (currently advertised as around 9,500
subscribers), who is interested in privacy?
  If there are lurkers here, from crs,  who would like me to continue to monitor for new software, and obtain/upload the software to crs,
please let me know.
  Regards, Dave Hodgins,  Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

@_subject: key servers list 
Does anyone have an up-to-date list of pgp keyservers available?
  Is there a fingerable keyserver, like wasabi at io.com used to be?
  Thanks in advance, Dave Hodgins.
