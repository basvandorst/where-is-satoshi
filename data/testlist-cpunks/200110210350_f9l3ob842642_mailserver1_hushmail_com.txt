Hmm, one of these would be handy.
Nahh... probably too expensive and difficult to purchase.  All you need is an ALPS dye-sub printer.  Quality is photo.  The 1300/2300 models can be had for about $100-150 on eBay.  The paper tray folds down to allow a straight path past the print heads.  ID card, laminate stock and CDs are easily accomodated.  You can even produce watermark overlays (great for state seals) by peeling the barcode cassette ID from a consumed black cartridge and pasting it over the "color" (e.g., metallic silver, gold or transparent) cartridge you want for a water mark.  The printer scans the cartridges when you close the cover and will think the color overlay cartridge is black.
