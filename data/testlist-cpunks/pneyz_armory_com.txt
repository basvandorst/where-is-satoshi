As you should know, blue boxes are (with some exceptions), not operable in the US. If you do not live in the US, they still should not work for you as most foreign countries use NACTS or another standard instead of ACTS. In the USA, blue boxes will not work under 5ESS or several other recent versions of the switching system as they utilize multi-band signalling, meaning that if you use a blue box to drop a trunk, the line goes dead since the signalling is on another frequency that you cannot hear. It is still possible to blue box, but it requires going through primitive switching software like step-by-step, crossbar, or 1ESS (I think). It is really not worth it, a red-box is a much better bet, or code fraud (calling, credit, or 950/PBXes), along with op-diverting.
Still, plans can be found in almost any hacker ftp site. Try ftping to ftp.winternet.com in the directory /user/nitehwk/phreak.
For a list of some telnettable boards, grab the alt.2600/ FAQ from the same directory. It has a few, although no really good ones (you'll have to find them yourself).

Very good point, phreaking's getting tricky. First of all, forget blue boxes, they're worthless, especially to an amateur, which you (HeLiuM) obviouisly are. Get a red box. Go to Radio Shack and buy a digital recorder pocket memo thing. They're about ten bucks and it's alot easier than getting a handheld DTMF dialer (which is annoying to solder because RS doesn't make them very well). Get BlueBeep or something (ftp.fc.net/pub/defcon/BLUEBEEP) and record some quarter tones. Go to a Bell payphone (CoCoTs and USWest phones do not work) and dial "1+area+npa+number", like a normal call. Then play the tones. For a local call, dial "10288+area+npa+number", which makes AT&T think it's along distance call.

Sorry. By NPA, I meant the prefix as in xxx-NPA-xxxx in a phone number. It's like normal. You can't make local calls like normal because payphones do not use the tone system ACTS (Automated Coin Toll System) for local calls, they process it internally, the way privaately owned payphones do (CoCoTs). You need to get AT&T into�?A� the call by using their 10xxx extender. You dial 10288-area-npa-number and AT&T thinks it's a normal long distance call and the payphone is out of it. When you put the tones into it, it will react like a long distance call. Making local calls this way will cost about $3.50 but it's not real money. A DTMF dialer is a thing Radio Shack sells that looks vaguely like a remote for a TV but it has all the telephone numbers on it, like if you took the keypad out of your phone. When you hit a key, it produces a tone
that is recognized �??�by the phone, that is a DTMF tone. DTMF stands for Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency as it is a combination of two tones. By putting a 6.5335 mhrtz crystal in place of the original one, the asterisk (*) key will now produce the nickel tone (1700mhz+2200mhz) and if you got a dialer with memory, you can program it to play a quarter, 1/2 sec pause, quarter... etc. It is really easy but you need to be able to solder. Me and a friend made two of these and almost broke both, RS doesn't make them incredibly high quality. You might also want to get one soon because RS is going to stop selling them (that's what I've heard at least).

@_subject: Finally -- A crypto question from me...HD encryption 
Yes, the KOH disk encryption system. It is a small little thing that encrypts the FAT (I believe) and nothing will work unless you know the password. I also have a thing from the Navy that they use on their computers which might encrypt the HD (I haven't checked it out yet). You can find KOH at just about any extensive file listing of crypto or hacking stuff. Try to find Silicone Toad's File Resources, as it has the
