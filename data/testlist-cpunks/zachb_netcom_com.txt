Actually, the report said that the NSA had made chips with a virus on them, and that it supposedly knocked out some of their computers.  I think it was U.S. World & News that ran the story as fact, and stood by it even when it was proven to be false.  Makes you wonder if the media bothers to do any fact-checking when reporting, especially when reporting on computer topics these days.

Apparently, a fire underneath one of the main towers on the CA-OR border was the cause of the problem.  Now that may not sound like too much, but the lines were carrying at least 3000Mw of electricity, enough "to power 3-1/2 Seattles for a day" (quote from local newspaper).  My guess is that when there is a problem involving that much power with no place to go, the safety systems shut everything down to prevent damage.

Insult to Clinton leads to 2 arrests
[A] Chicago-area couple were arrested on charges of
    disorderly conduct and interrogated for more than
12 hours last week, simply because the woman told
President Clinton exactly what she thought of him.
  Last Tuesday, Mr. Clinton made an impromptu stop at
the "Taste of Chicago" festival in Grant Park at
  According to her husband, Patricia Mendoza, angered
and upset by the recent deaths of 19 U.S. airmen in
Saudi Arabia, told the president, "You suck, and
those boys died!"
  Once the president left the area, Secret Service
agents and Chicago police converged on Mrs. Mendoza
and accused her of threatening the president, a
charge her husband, Glenn, vehemently denies.
  "It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out
that if my wife had threatened the president -- which
she did not -- I can guarantee we wouldn't have been
locked up on charges of disorderly conduct," the
Westchester, Ill., man told The Washington Times in a
telephone interview last night.
  Mr. Mendoza served in the Navy for 4 1/2 years, and
he was on a ship off the Lebanese coast when the 1983
bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut killed
241 Marines and sailors. "I didn't sit on an aircraft
carrier for four years to be railroaded by a bunch of
Secret Service agents," he said.
  Secret Service spokesman Ar nette Heintze said:
"People don't get locked up just for saying, 'You
suck.' You could say that all day long and it's not a
violation of law or local ordinances."
  Mr. Heintze insisted that Mrs. Mendoza "made a
threatening statement" to the president, but he
refused to elaborate, saying that the matter was
under investigation. "It's a situation that happens
from time to time, but it's something we take very
seriously," he said.
  The incident sparked a media frenzy in Chicago but
had yet to surface on the East Coast until radio
talk-show host G. Gordon Liddy discussed it on his
nationally syndicated program yesterday.
  Mr. Liddy told The Times: "I think it's outrageous.
Everybody agrees that if there's a threat, the Secret
Service clearly can detain the individuals and do an
  "But 'You suck, those boys died' is not a threat.
It's an expression of anger, contempt or ridicule.
It's wrong for the Secret Service to detain someone
if there's no threat," he said.
  Mr. Mendoza, who owns a small electronics firm, and
his wife were at the festival with their employees,
unaware that the president was coming. Suddenly, he
recalled, the Secret Service descended on the park,
throwing up barriers and preventing anyone from
leaving the area.
  A black car drove up, Mr. Clinton leaped out and
began shaking hands with onlookers, and Mrs. Mendoza
found herself face to face with the president, Mr.
Mendoza said.
  Mr. Clinton shook her hand and she reacted by
pulling it back and telling him, "You suck, those
boys died," Mr. Mendoza said. He said the president
looked at her, then motioned to an assistant as he
moved along the rest of the line. "He wasn't
pleased," Mr. Mendoza said.
  Soon afterward, Mr. Mendoza said, Secret Service
agents began accusing his wife of threatening the
president's life. At that point, he said, he began
directing his wife: "Trish, don't say anything. We
need a lawyer."
  An officer told him to shut up and he responded,
"Screw you. I have a right to tell my wife to get a
lawyer when she's getting interrogated by the Secret
Service," Mr. Mendoza said.
  He concluded, "The fact is, I was arrested because
I was swearing at my wife."
  Chicago police arrested the couple at the request
of the Secret Service. The Mendozas were questioned
until their release on personal-recognizance bond at
4 a.m.
  Mr. Mendoza denied any political ill will toward
Mr. Clinton.
  "I'm apolitical. I was in the military, had a good
record, have a wife and two kids, a small business,"
he said. But he fears the incident will be
exaggerated because of election-year politics and the
Democratic National Convention coming to Chicago next
  "They're making us look like Bonnie and Clyde,
Republican poster children. And that's not who we
are," Mr. Mendoza said.

THE WASHINGTON TIMES
   The U.S. Secret Service yesterday sought to distance itself from
the arrest of a Chicago-area couple who "insulted" President
Clinton during his visit to a festival there last week.
   Yet even as it was discounting its role in the arrests of Glenn
and Patricia Mendoza, the Secret Service was consulting with
the U.S. attorney in Chicago about criminal charges against the
   And Secret Service and Chicago police spokesmen differed on
several details of the incident, which is triggering growing
outrage on talk radio and even from a prominent Republican
member of Congress.
   The Mendozas were at the Taste of Chicago festival in Grant
Park on July 2 when Mr. Clinton dropped by to shake hands in
the crowd. Mrs. Mendoza, upset over last month's bombing deaths
of 19 U.S. airmen in Saudi Arabia, told the president as he took
her hand: "You suck, and those boys died."
   Mr. Mendoza said the president looked at her, then motioned
to an assistant as he moved along shaking hands.
   After the president left, Secret Service agents accused Mrs.
Mendoza of threatening the president. Her husband stepped in
and ordered her not to say anything until they called a lawyer.
   "That is not accurate," Secret Service spokesman Arnette
Heintze said yesterday of the Men dozas' version. "A direct
threat was made, but I'm not going to elaborate. Mrs. Mendoza has
a right to fair representation of her case, as does the
prosecution, and the newspaper is not the proper place to air
this case.
   "We were there because a verbal threat was made to the
president, and the Secret Service is responsible for the
physical safety of the president."
   Rep. Robert Livingston, Louisiana Republican, is among
those angered by what he called Secret Service overreaction.
"Is this going to be the norm? If you criticize the president,
are you going to be arrested by a bunch of federal agents and
thrown in jail overnight? That's a frightening thought."
   "I think on the heels of this FBI investigation, with these
FBI files in the White House, this kind of symbolizes an
appalling lack of respect for human rights and for the rights of
people to speak out in this country," Mr. Livingston said in a
C-SPAN interview.
   Mr. Heintze, who complained about continuing media
interest in the Mendoza matter, said the Secret Service thought
there was no need to arrest the couple at the festival because
Mr. Clinton had moved on. He said Chicago police arrested the
Mendozas because of their conduct after the president left.
   "The Mendozas refused to follow police directions, and so
they opted to arrest them. We supported them in their action,
but it was an independent act by the police.
   "The arrest was separate and incidental to our questioning of
the Mendozas," Mr. Heintze said.
   The Mendozas were charged with disorderly conduct, a
misdemeanor, and were interrogated for 12 hours before they
were released. No federal charges have been filed.
   The case has been complicated by conflicting details from the
   The Chicago Police Department says it is handling the
matter. Department spokesman Patrick Camden said yesterday,
"There's no Secret Service involvement, to my knowledge." The
couple are scheduled to appear in misdemeanor court Aug. 27.
   But Ralph Grayson, special agent in charge of the Secret
Service's Chicago office, said his agency has an "ongoing
investigation" into the matter.
   The Secret Service said Mrs. Mendoza made a "threatening
statement" to the president that was far more serious than the
one Mrs. Mendoza says she made, but it declined to say what the
threat was.
   Mr. Camden said Mrs. Mendoza had hinted at "blowing up
the president." "She said something to the effect that 'He [Mr.
Clinton] should have been blown up instead of the 19
   Mr. Heintze said emphatically, "That is not accurate, and
don't try to find out what the threat was."
   A Chicago police spokesman said yesterday that the Secret
Service had not asked them to arrest the Mendozas, as was
previously reported, but that the couple were arrested for
creating a disturbance.
   The extent to which alcohol contributed to the incident is
also in question.
   Mr. Camden said: "Sure, there was alcohol. They both had
been drinking. A rational person doesn't act that way. This was
a family event, there were kids around, and these people were
saying a lot more than 'You suck.' In fact, it rhymed with
   Mr. Mendoza acknowledged that when Secret Service agents
accused his wife of threatening the president's life, "I was
screaming at the top of my lungs. Granted, I was angry, scared,
upset, and if that's disorderly, I guess so."
   He said he was not drunk. Mr. Mendoza said he repeatedly
demanded that he be given a blood breath test, but the police
   "We wouldn't do a Breathalyzer test, even if he asked," the
police spokesman said.
   "We are so sensitive about First Amendment rights," said the
Secret Service spokesman. "I can assure you that if the Secret
Service was doing anything contrary to the Constitution, the
president would not tolerate it, and he would make big
changes," he said.

Hello all,
I just got off the phone with Johann Helsingius who runs the
anon.penet.fi anonymous e-mail service.
1. He has decided to close the service.
2. This is not related to the article in The Observer. It is, in fact,
due to a decision of a lower Finnish court on petition from the Church
of Scientology. Penet went to court last week and made the decision
today. The implication of the decision is that e-mail over the Internet
is not protect by the usual Finnish privacy laws.
3. The server is currently down while Julf re-writes the software. Once
it runs again, it will be phased out for private use, but groups such as
the Samaritans and human rights agencies should be able to use it.
4. They are appealing against the decision.
5. Julf expects that revisions in Finnish law to provide a safe legal
status for anonymous remailers will be in place at the earliest in
Spring next year.
6. Once again: this is unrelated to The Observer's scandalous reporting.
Your faithful furry friend,

Sorry . . . a slight error:
The implication of the court's decision (rather than Penet's to shut the

[Julf's press release. -Declan]
                                PRESS RELEASE
                                30.8.1996
Johan Helsingius closes his Internet remailer
Johan Helsingius from Helsinki has decided to close his Internet
remailer. The so-called anonymous remailer is the most popular
remailer in the world, with over half a million users.
"I will close down the remailer for the time being because the legal
issues governing the whole Internet in Finland are yet undefined. The
legal protection of the users needs to be clarified. At the moment the
privacy of Internet messages is judicially unclear."
The idea of an anonymous remailer is to protect the confidentiality of it�s
users� identity. The remailer itself does not store messages but serves as a
channel for message transmission. The remailer forwards messages
without the identity of the original sender.
Finland is one of the leading countries in Internet usage. Therefore all
decisions and changes made in Finland arouse wide international interest.
"I have developed and maintained the remailer in my free time for over
three years now. It has taken up a lot of time and energy. Internet has
changed a lot in these three years - now there are dozens of remailers in
the world, which offer similar services."
"I have also personally been a target because of the remailer for three
years. Unjustified accusations affect both my job and my private life"
says Johan Helsingius.
He surmises that the closing of the remailer will raise a lot of discussion
among the Internet community. "These remailers have made it possible
for people to discuss very sensitive matters, such as domestic violence,
school bullying or human rights issues anonymously and confidentially
on the Internet. To them the closing of the remailer is a serious problem",
says Helsingius.
Child porn claims proven false
Last Sunday�s issue of the English newspaper Observer claimed that the
remailer has been used for transmitting child pornography pictures. The
claims have been investigated by the Finnish police. Observer�s claims
have been found groundless.
Police sergeant Kaj Malmberg from the Helsinki Police Crime Squad is
specialized in investigating computer crimes. He confirms that already a
year ago Johan Helsingius restricted the operations of his remailer so that
it cannot transmit pictures.
"The true amount of child pornography in Internet is difficult to assess,
but one thing is clear: We have not found any cases where child porn
pictures were transmitted from Finland", Kaj Malmberg says.
Ground rules need to be clarified
There are several large network projects going on in Finland at the
moment, such as the TIVEKE project run by the Ministry of
Communications and the Information Society Forum project run by the
Ministry of Finance. Johan Helsingius is participating the work of these
projects. Projects assess the political and social issues of networks and
the impact of these issues in the long run. These projects also need the
support of daily, practical work to help short-term decision-making.
Johan Helsingius is now taking an initiative in the development of the
daily network rules. He wants to set up a task force to discuss the
practical problems related to ethical and civil rights issues in connection
with the Internet.
"I will try to set up a task force which will include Internet
experts together with representatives of civic organizations and
authorities. The task force could take a stand on issues such as the
network�s practical operation methods and the misuse of the network. I
hope that the results of this task force will support the development of
the network", he says.

Cracks Are Found In Smartcard Security
Researchers have found a way to attack tough codes, says Michael
A team of Cambridge and German researchers have used ordinary hacking
methods and ï¿½150 worth of electronics equipment to crack the "world's
most secure computer chip", used in automated teller machines worldwide.
They say their technique could be used to reprogram a wide variety of
supposedly secure smartcard applications, including the Mondex "money on
a card" bankcard, GSM phones, and satellite TV descramblers.
Dr Ross Anderson, of Cambridge University Computer Laboratory, working
with German researcher Markus Kuhn, used methods pioneered by Sky-TV
hackers to crack the Dallas chip, described by the manufacturer as
having "the most sophisticated security features available in any
microcontroller" and used in most of Britain's cash machines.
The chip decodes the information read from bankcards and authorises the
bank machine to process transactions ordered by the owner. It is also
used by the Mondex system to verify the amount of electronic money
available to the cardholder.
Anderson and Kuhn used cheap and easily built electronic equipment to
send wrong instructions to the chip, observing how it encrypted bad
data. By sending such errors through all parts of the encryption system,
they could work out its key.
"You will have to have backup security"
"Once you know that, you can instruct it to put some zeros on the end of
your Mondex balance, start unscrambling your satellite feed, anything
you like," Anderson said. "Breaking the average smartcard can be done by
anyone with a modicum of technical knowledge by the methods we have
described. The expense is negligible but it is time-consuming."
Their discovery could spell the end of the Mondex system, which relies
entirely on the security of the smartcards for its integrity. "I don't
think you will be able to have floating systems like Mondex any more,
where all the information is held on the smartcards," said Anderson.
"You will have to have backup security with authorisation calls and
auditing, just like ordinary credit cards. The smartcards are no longer
reliable on their own."
John Beric, head of security at Mondex, said security was a moving
target, and he was unconcerned by the findings. "I welcome Dr Anderson's
work, because it's a benchmark that establishes the difficulty of
breaking the system," he said. "I take some comfort that it's taken a
Cambridge academic and a very bright student to do this."
Beric said Mondex had a scheme for continually improving its security by
transparently introducing new smartcard chips every two years. "It's not
static, we're ahead of the criminal now, and we believe the technology
is there to ensure that we stay ahead."
Anderson said his latest research indicated that two of the world's most
widely used systems for encoding sensitive financial information - the
RSA and DES encryption standards used by most banks - could also be
cracked easily."

NEW YORK -- Microsoft Corp. Chairman and CEO Bill Gates pitched the
Windows NT operating system here Wednesday as more similar to Unix than
different during a keynote address at Unix Expo. Gates also used his time on stage in the packed auditorium to comment on
the encryption battle which U.S. companies are currently fighting with the
federal government. The "U.S. government is making it fairly difficult for
companies like Microsoft who want to use strong cryptographic techniques,"
Gates said. Two weeks ago, the Clinton administration announced that U.S. companies
would be allowed to export products encrypted with a 56-bit key, up from
the 40-bit-based key currently permitted, but Gates characterized this
improvement as "tiny." A 56-bit key "is not nearly good enough," Gates
said. InfoWorld Publishing Company

I think you would also be able to use Procmail and Formail (two UNIX mail processing programs) to set up a quick and dirty remailer.  Procmail could be set to look at the headers of a message for something like a header of "Remail-To:", or [REMAIL] in the Subject: header.

I just checked  to see what kind of system they have, and it appears that it is a free email service.  No charges at all.  No wonder we get so many idiots from there - free mail and they probably don't bother to verify the people they give service to, either.

Feather and Johan Helsingius ... a review of the "first" toddler
CD-ROM... How have the mighty crusaders fallen !  Sic transit gloria

Oh, well, that just narrows it down really well.  Might as well just take out all of the machines now, because you could make a case that just about ANYTHING out of a vending machine is "harmful to minors".  Soda machines? Caffeine and sugar.  Snack machines?  Sugar again.  Those machines in supermarkets that give little toys?  A child *could* swallow one and choke.  And on and on and on.  Even if this statute is meant only to apply to cigarette machines, which would seem to be the case given all of the anti-cig stuff going on now,
what good will it do?  I have never (in 20 years living in CA) seen a cigarette machine out where a child could get something from it, only inside a pool hall or another adult-only establishment.  Another one of those bills to "selectively enforce" things, perhaps?  Sheesh.

It's still mostly the same thing.  I've never seen the type of machine that you're talking about, and I don't think anyone would be dumb enough to install one in a store that is near a school, or frequented my minors.  This law just does not seem like a very good idea.

I also demand that you send me $10,000 for taking up my valuable time with this message, and $5,000 for network access fees.
Have a nice day!
Even if you are serious about this, the fact that you signed up to a mailing list entitles you to all of the messages that go over this list, plus people's replies to your posts.  The point of my original message was that mail from a non-commercial individual, such as yourself or other people on this list is welcomed, but mail from people trying to sell me something is not.  Perhaps I should have made that more clear in my original post.

@_subject: WARNING: Major Net-Abuse 
I don't know the full details about this, so I'll try to give as good an explanation as I can.  Since sometime yesterday, someone has been posting huge binaries all over Usenet, usually to at least 20 groups at a time.  The files are usually several thousand parts big at the least, and are posted to either groups in which people are likely to respond with emailbombs, or test groups that send you a reply if the message appears on them.  What some $ are doing is changing the Reply-To headers to the addresses of people who they dislike or want to harass.  See where I'm going now?  10000 posts to a test group with your address on it = 10000 emails in your inbox.
I posted this because there are some people on both of these lists who might be the target of one of these spams, and you might want to get your killfiles ready, just in case.  Thanks for your time, and sorry if I annoyed anyone with the off-topic post.  Zach Babayco

No, you're not a censor.  You are merely determining what *you* choose to read.  That's perfectly acceptable - probably a lot of people on this list also filter their messages to some extent.  Now, if you tried to force the rest of us to abide by the standards that you set for yourself, then you would be trying to censor us.  There is a big difference here.

All sniffers have to write to disk at some point.  You can detect one by checking to see how much disk space you have (DIR on MSDOS), typing a few lines of random characters, and check your disk space again.  If it's gone down a little, then you probably have one.
Try checking in your TEMP directory...the few ones that I've seen default to creating an invisible file in that directory.
They either buy them or write them.

Unsubscribe everyone from all the lists, wait a bit, and then send a message to all of the subscribers with full info on each of the lists (cp, cp-unedited,cp-flames) and see what happens when they resubscribe. I bet that most of the people who don't post and don't care one way or the other wouldn't bother to resubscribe, so we'd have a higher ratio of people who mind if the list is moderated vs. those who'd be happy either way.

  used was that of Mercury News Computing Editor
  Dan Gillmor in the ruse that included 200 messages to Sen. Barbara

@_subject: [STATS] Cypherpunks subscriptions on and off 
Not necessarily, Steve - some people plonk others by filtering their mail to a folder called "trash" or "crap-messages" or whatever, so they don't have to read them at the same time they read the rest of their messages.  Then they go through the trash folder later on just to see if they threw out anything that they shouldn't have, see the messages by the people they killfiled, and reply to some of them.  They HAVE plonked the person, but they can still read and reply to the plonked messages if they choose.  IMO, this is a better way to killfile than redirecting everything to you say (like some people on this list who shall remain nameless), you don't have to read their flames at the same time with the rest of the mail, but still have the option of reading and replying to them later on if you so choose.
