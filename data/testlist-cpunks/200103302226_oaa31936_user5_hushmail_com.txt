Secret Service Raids E-Gold

   WASHINGTON -- The Secret Service has raided a New York state business
   that exchanged dollars for grams of the digital currency called
   e-gold.
   A bevy of agents from the Secret Service, Postal Service and local
   police recently detained the owners of Gold-Age, based in Syracuse,
   and seized computers, files and documents from the fledgling firm.
Let this be a lesson to those operating such legal but controversial services that they keep all important records off site and use offshore systems to process and store data related to their transactions.  This way seizures of equipment become only a minor annoyance.
