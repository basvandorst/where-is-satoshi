That's good news.  The duplicated messages were confusing.

Please allow me to apologize -- I'm considering replacing the ds.pro-ns.net CDR node.  "cryptofortress.com" is mine, and I had believed
I only had it set up to forward cypherpunks postings to a testing list
while I worked on the details.  Obviously, this was not the case,
and I have deactivated it while I look for the cause of the problem.
I realize that mailing lists doing this sort of thing is irritating,
and I'll try to make sure it doesn't happen again.

I've set mine to 1280000.  It had been 12800.
I see duplicates from certain people very consistently.  I've
suspected that they address their mail to multiple CDRs and are
getting unique Message-IDs for each, but I've never checked into

And, following up my own post:
The next two messages I read were from Eugene Leitl, who is someone
that I see duplicates from on every post.  His Message-Ids were technically the same, but they are long, and someone's server is
splitting them into two lines:
Message-Id: Message-Id: I think formail should be concatenating the lines before making the
check, but I see that it has a -c option that may help.

Sorry, folks.  Hit the wrong key.  Apologies for forwarding spam instead
of deleting it.

Sorry for the intrusion.  (I upgraded Majordomo, and the list is quiet
enough that I'm not sure if I broke anything.)
Please ignore this message to the best of your ability.

Eric hasn't formally abdicated, but let me remind everyone and the archives
that there's an alternative node, cypherpunks at ds.pro-ns.net, that runs in a
substantially similar way to Eric's.  It even uses some or most of the same
scripts that Eric uses on lne.com.
(The functionality that we're referring to here is that spam is mostly kept off
list by only allowing posts from members of the list plus known anonymous
remailers, known members of other nodes, etc.  Posts that don't make it
initially get forwarded by the node owners, and then posts from that user make
it automatically from then on.)
The ds.pro-ns.net node is hosted at the ISP that I own, so it doesn't suffer
from any dialup connectivity issues.
(I volunteered to take over for Eric in private email.  He suggested that
I remind everyone of the alternative, first.)

It's a constant distraction.
It's analogous to a radio astronomy mailing list constantly being trolled
by flat earthers.
Once the flat earthers leave, the conversation will get interesting again.

I think my analogy is good.  I think your error is displayed by your
analogy.  In your example, both groups are astronomers.
In the current situation on this list, both groups are _not_ cypherpunks, if
you accept the definition of cypherpunks as "people who use encryption technology to make statism impossible."  If you don't accept that
definition, that's fine, but I think my definition is consistent with
the history of the list, and my guess is that Tim would agree.  And he's
the one who asked the question in the first place.  I think it's a good
question, and I'm curious to hear the answer from one of the folks it's
aimed at.
You left statists out of your list, unless you were including them when
you said "cranks" and "gun control nuts".  The original question was about
Some interesting people have left.  Other interesting people have
joined and are contributing.

Some folks might want to spend their time proving and convincing.  I
think it gets old after a while, and the challenge lacks appeal.
I've never thought of the cypherpunks as proselytizing types.
But hey, knock your self out.  The September that Never Ended was years
ago, so there's an infinite supply of people for you to bang your
head against.
