@_subject: Ranks Of Privacy 'Pragmatists' Are Growing 
By Mary Mosquera, TechWeb News
Dec 7, 2000 (6:02 AM)
URL:  WASHINGTON -- The issue of privacy is growing increasingly complex as Americans express concern over abuse of their personal data -- yet still support institutions that handle their information. In a new survey of privacy and protection, an inevitable paradox emerges: While most Americans support the free flow of information from public records, they are concerned about their privacy in some instances when personal information is extracted from those records, a recent survey showed. Consumers are accepting that commercial companies supply background information on them from public records. Still, they said, it must be for a valid social or legal purpose, such as for employment or law enforcement.
And protections against misuse must be in place, according to the survey, Public Records and the Responsible Use of Information.
More Americans are concerned about privacy than in the past, but they take a more balanced view now, said Alan Westin, president of Privacy and American Business, which conducted the survey with ORC International.
"More of those now registering concern fall into 'privacy pragmatist' rather than the 'privacy fundamentalist' camp," Westin said.
That more balanced outlook contributes to the broad support for commercial access to personal information from public records. And the focus on information gathering over the Internet by millions of Net users has fostered consumers accepting commercial access to their information, Westin said. How to balance good privacy policies and social values served by disseminating public-record information is an important issue in an era when abuse of that information, especially over the Internet, has led to fraud and identity theft.
The 1,000 adults surveyed found it acceptable if companies provided personal information for law enforcement, such as past or present fraudulent conduct or criminal convictions, or for hiring. Using public records to locate a current residence or work address was the least acceptable service, unless it was for law enforcement, potential employers, or consumer credit companies.
Those polled thought it acceptable, but less so, for private investigators and ordinary citizens to access public records for background and location information, the report said.
Consumers strongly oppose the government posting personally identified public information on the Internet.
"However, opposition fades when specific safeguards are introduced," the report said.
Safeguards included the government requiring the consent of the individual before displaying a public record file on the Internet and demanding a specific, legitimate purpose from a user before allowing their access.
"Sensitive personal information, such as Social Security numbers or medical conditions, were removed prior to displaying the public record on the Internet," the report said.
The sale of Social Security numbers over the Internet is a source of privacy abuse and identity theft.
"Regulating the purchase and sale of Social Security numbers over the Internet won't come overnight," said Ron Plesser, a partner at Piper Marbury Rudnick & Wolfe, Washington. "It's a challenge for industry how to use Social Security numbers properly."

update HONG KONG--Siemens has a solution for people who constantly forget computer passwords: a mouse that recognizes fingerprints. Called the ID Mouse, the device uses biometrics to take advantage of the unique features of people's fingerprints. German electronics maker Siemens, which showed off the ID Mouse this week at the ITU Asia Telecom 2000 fair, said the device works by allowing pre-authorized people to retrieve information from their PCs or laptops. By lightly tapping the fingertip sensor located at the top of the mouse, the device verifies the fingerprint against reference templates already input into the PC's system. Once a fingerprint is authenticated, the person can then access the PC's main operating system. Siemens is one of numerous companies headed in the direction of using unique features for identification. The mouse is powered by 65,000 sensing elements on the 0.25 square-inch fingertip chip that enables the device to scan and capture the fine details of a fingerprint. The system is so sensitive that it will recognize an authorized person even if there is a cut on the fingertip. For added security, if the mouse user takes a break, the screensaver is activated until the person touches the ID Mouse again. Other than that, the ID Mouse operates just like any Microsoft mouse. It has a wheel scroll for navigation and requires at least Microsoft Windows 98 and a USB connection. This week's conference is the International Telecommunications Union's 23rd telecom show since its 1971 debut in Geneva. The six-day fair, which ends Saturday, took place in Hong Kong this year and was expected to attract at least 50,000 visitors from more than 50 countries. Singapore.CNET.com's Priscilla Wong reported from Hong Kong.

@_subject: Device could lead to hack-proof data  
By Dan Vergano, USA TODAY
Scientists have unveiled a miniature device that emits light particles, or photons, one at a time, an accomplishment which could pave the way for impregnable coded messages and electronic commerce in coming decades. In theory, such a single light particle offers benefits to people hoping to create secure communications, including bankers in need of secure pathways for transactions or governments relaying secret diplomatic documents.
Writing in Friday's Science, researchers note that such fundamental particles cannot be examined without altering their physical characteristics, part of the physics theory known as quantum mechanics. To create an unbreakable code, physicists plan to send a stream of single photons imprinted with the key to a later coded message. If transmitted via fiber-optic cable, a third party could not intercept the particles without scrambling the key. Alerted to the transgression, the target of the eavesdropping would halt transmission of the coded message.
''I think this work represents a very nice advance towards that goal,'' says David Peter DiVincenzo, an encryption expert at IBM's T.J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y. But a number of technological hurdles need to be overcome before so-called ''quantum cryptography'' becomes a reality, he cautions.
To create a photon ''turnstile,'' a University of California-Santa Barbara research team placed ''quantum dots'' Q crystals containing confined groups of negative- and positive-charged atoms Q onto a mushroom-shaped semiconductor. When pulsed with a laser, the structure releases a single photon, the team reports in Science.
Even lasers, which represent the best control of light emission today, release tens of thousands of photons at once, whereas control of single photons has long been a scientific goal.
''Really, it's about the ultimate control of light,'' DiVincenzo says. At least four other teams are pursuing single-photon devices, he adds. In September, for example, Stanford University researchers reported a way to produce single photons that is 84% efficient.
Now, ''we can produce a photon every time, so the efficiency is 100%,'' says scientist Pierre Petroff of UC-Santa Barbara, a member of the device team led by his colleague Atac Imamoglu.
In the next year, the photon turnstile team hopes to raise the temperature at which their device functions above its current limit of minus-321 degrees Fahrenheit. They hope to produce the effect at room temperatures.
Support for development of the photon turnstile came from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, a Defense Department agency charged with advancing information technology.

Crypto-anarchy is in fact not really anarchy, since it only addresses some kinds of authority, ie government, and only in certain situations. True anarchy involves the dissolution of other hierarchical relationships,
including those that spring from private property. Get rid of private property and many of these problems disappear.

Bush asks Freeh to stay at FBI, USA Today says
January 4, 2001
Web posted at: 3:21 AM EST (0821 GMT)
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- The incoming Bush administration has asked FBI Director Louis Freeh to remain on the job, USA Today reported Thursday, citing officials close to the situation. Freeh has told Federal Bureau of Investigation employees in an internal memo last month that he intends to complete his 10-year term that expires in 2003 and cannot be extended, USA Today said. Freeh declined to comment Wednesday, as did Bush transition officials, the newspaper said. Although he is an appointee of President Clinton, Freeh clashed with the president over questions about the transfer of FBI files to the White House. He also has differed with Attorney General Janet Reno's decision against launching an independent investigation of campaign finance irregularities involving Clinton and Vice President Al Gore.

"Ginger" inventor appears at Davos, stays mum
DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 30 (Reuters) - You just can't keep a good idea like "Ginger" down. Even if no one is quite sure what the idea in question is.
Not hordes of instant Internet fans bent on finding out. Not media pundits so ready to comment on the purportedly revolutionary technology. And, apparently, not even the inventor himself.
``Ginger'' is said to be the code name of an invention under development by U.S. inventor Dean Kamen. The technology, also referred to as ``IT,'' is thought to be some sort of personal hovercraft or radical new transportation device.
``I'm working on ten different projects,'' Kamen said. ``I don't even know which one they were talking about,'' he told Reuters when asked about the armchair speculation that has swept up everyone from computer industry leaders to news anchors to the neighbor next door.
Kamen declined to comment further on his work, saying he was bound by a confidentiality agreement.
Kamen was at the World Economic Business Forum in Davos, appearing in public for the first time since speculation about the invention began spreading over the Internet and into broadcast and print media.
Word leaked out two weeks ago in a report on a book proposal presented to Harvard Business School Press about Kamen's secretive project. Computer industry leaders such as Apple founder Steve Jobs and top venture capitalist John Doerr were said to back the project.
But no one who knows anything is saying, leaving anyone who doesn't know to wonder.
Popular fascination with the endless possibilities has inspired a variety of Web sites devoted to discovering the inventor's secret, including GingerPoll ( the IT question ( and links to various patent applications filed by Kamen.
Kamen joined a panel with Michael Dell, founder and chairman of Dell Computer Corp., to discuss ``Completing the Technology Revolution.'' During the panel discussion, Kamen again declined to comment on his work.
Other technology industry leaders appearing at the six-day meeting of global poltical and economic leaders were happy to join the high-tech world's latest parlor game and indulge their own guesses at what Kamen's mystery project might be about.
``I don't know what IT is. I think it stands for Individual Transporter, a scooter of some sort,'' said Michael Dertouzos, director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Lab for Computer Science.
Bill Joy, chief scientist at Sun Microsystems Inc. (NasdaqNM:SUNW - news) guessed it was a low- or zero-smog emission vehicle, built from carbon fiber and containing fuel cells as an energy generator.
The mystery continue

@_subject: ecoin.net: anonymous payments today? 
Back in 1999, Steve Lihn posted to cypherpunks and some other mailing
lists about his new online payment system, ecoin.net.  He intended to
work towards a blind coin system based on David Wagner's alternative to
Chaum blinding, as implemented by Ben Laurie in the lucre library.
Surprisingly, he is still in business.  Some recent press releases:
   8/15/01 eCoin OutExchange service is released. You can transfer fund
           to/from PayPal and e-Gold. Login and check it out.
   7/25/01 Anonymous Cash Certificate is released. MMDH is finally in
           commercial use. Login and check it out.
   6/30/01 PayPal Payment Interface is supported. Now you can transfer
           fund from your credit card by PayPal.
   6/25/01 Managed Access Solution is released. Use eCoin to pay your
           subscription!
   1/16/01 eCoin.net announces that e-Gold payment interface is formally
           supported. You will be able to purchase eCoins through your
           e-Gold account!
Sounds like it might be worth it just for the transfer to/from PayPal.
Also could be an alternative way to fund your e-Gold account anonymously.
With the blinding it could be a real anonymous payment system.  Credit
card to PayPal, PayPal to eCoin, transfer eCoin anonymously, then from
eCoin back to PayPal.  Anyone want to try a transfer experimentally?

Some thoughts on digital cash.
First, using anonymous cash to purchase physical goods online means giving
up much of the benefit from the anonymity.  If you have to give a delivery
address, they obviously know who you are.  It's still slightly better
than using your Visa card because only the seller learns your address
rather than a centralized agency that knows all of your purchases.
But it's hardly worth it.
Second, using digital cash for purchases in the real world (grocery stores
etc) is pretty much impossible today and relatively pointless anyway since
physical cash exists.  There might be some slight advantages in terms of
not having to carry cash, resistance to theft, etc., but from the privacy
perspective, things are about as good as they are going to get in the
physical world.  It's only going to go downhill from here.  It may not
be as bad as Scott "Get Over It" McNealy claims but realistically the use
of surveillance cameras and face recognition systems is going to increase.
Third, this leaves the use of digital cash to purchase information goods
and services online.  The problem is, few companies have succeeded so far
in selling information goods online, and the problems have nothing to do
with the payment system or privacy issues.  With self-contained products
like music and software, piracy is rampant.  There are some service
businesses which are producing and selling information successfully,
but usually they are in the B2B market where privacy is less of an issue.
Fourth, the significant exception is of course pornography, and
we've had debates about whether it would make sense to create a
privacy-protecting electronic payment system that catered to the porn
market.  It's profitable, it's information, and there are significant
privacy considerations for some customers.
Unfortunately the greatest sensitivity to privacy comes with illegal
products like child pornography.  And the Reedy case has to be a
significant cautionary tale.  Thomas Reedy was proprietor of an age
verification service which had a couple of overseas child pornographers
among its customers; he ended up with life imprisonment for what was
essentially a payment collection service.  Any digital cash system
for the porn market would therefore have to screen its clients (the
sellers) very closely.  It's the buyers to whom you are selling privacy,
not the sellers, so this is not inconsistent with the business model.
But it could be expensive.  And by eliminating illegal porn you would
be turning away much of your potential business, leading to a constant
temptation to cross the line as Reedy did.
Can we identify other markets, other applications where cash or cash-like
technology can be useful?  MojoNation is a good example.  Their mojo is
intended to be a cash substitute to optimize load balancing and data
distribution.  Unfortunately the MN network lacks compelling content
and the economy is still crude.  But the idea is sound; P2P networks
which reward providers of information should flourish.  The slashdot
quota system is another example.  Also, various "warez" sites work on
an exchange basis, where people get credit for uploading files which
gives them authorization to download.
Imagine if all these systems could be served by a single virtual currency,
where resources and work donated in one forum earned points which would
entitle you to privileges in another.  Eric Hughes proposed something
similar back in the days of the text-based MUD and MOO online games, so
that you could transfer quota from one system to another.  Or consider the
example recently where several people expressed interest in having someone
go back to the early cypherpunk archives and select interesting threads.
What if each of us had some virtual cash we could transfer to whomever
did the work.
The point is that there is a possibility today for an online market in
informal, peer to peer style information services.  There is work to be
done, services to provide which remain entirely in the virtual world.
If you could be rewarded for work you do online with "cash" that would
allow you to request similar services from others, the monetary system
can get off the ground.  This might be a more promising start for a
virtual currency than attempts to tie it immediately to dollars.

Unfortunately U.S. postal regulations require identification when you
rent a mail box, public or private.  See
   Recent amendments to postal regulations will make it harder for
   criminals to victimize innocent consumers by using mail drops.
   Anyone renting a box from a commercial mail-receiving agency such
   as Mail Boxers, Etc., Parcel Post, and Postnet will be required to
   provide two forms of ID, one being a photo ID.
It won't do much good to chain them if each one in the chain has your
ID on file.  Granted you can use fake ID but that would be breaking the
law, raising the costs considerably.
