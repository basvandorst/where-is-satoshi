Oh, wow, such info!  The old red box trick!  In fact, I'd be willing to
bet it doesn't even explain how to build a red box, it probably just
tells you something dumb like to call a pay phone and then have a friend
answer it and put in money while you record the tones.
Of course, it probably doesn't even mention how easy it is to make free
calls from COCOTs!
More like "how to use an EPROM burner".
Yup, just like the firemen do. As if every amateur electronics book didn't explain this.
Yeah, back up your electric meter by 1 unit and get charged for
999,999,999 kilowatthours. :)
As if we haven't seen this one before.
Oh, how informative!  As if any idiot couldn't get a book from his local
library that explains how to build a radio transmitter.  If anyone here
seriously doesn't know how to build a radio transmitter, may I direct
you to: cp-hardware at nextsrv.cas.muohio.edu
