I thought they were supposed to keep classified and unclassified material on
separate machines and networks. The information in this document would presumably
be classified, and the machine it was on shouldn't have had internet access. The
rules are there to prevent just this sort of thing.
Of course, as we saw in the case of John Deutch, these rules are broken.
