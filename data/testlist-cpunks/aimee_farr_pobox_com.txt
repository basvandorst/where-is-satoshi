You've got a sympathant reporter that knows his beat. Also, he's protective,

full-teeth news orgs roll over as a matter of practice, and wouldn't offer
you any level of source protection. (I previously posted an outline for a
reporter-source agreement, but it's not much help in a criminal context.) If

Declan's fault that press shields have been shot full of holes. I know some
reporters that have fought these fights... some have trouble finding work...
all are nervous near federal all-terrain vehicles.
Nevertheless, Seth, your post is illustrative. The erosion of press shields
in this country only serve to *keep information away* from the general
public and authorities. On balance, I wonder if it might cost them more than
they gain from it. When discontents stop talking to reporters, the
government is in the dark until ..."KABOOOM!"
Another way to draw attention to oneself, or one's cause, is to talk to
reporters. Sadly, many "could be dangerous people" are reluctant to do that
now. A trusted in-the-know reporter can serve an important educational role
to the LEA and the public, who sometimes "misunderstand" collective groups
of individuals. This educational role can be in the interests of all
parties, and need not involve testimony, prosecutorial acts, or finking.
Just judicially unfettered newsgathering and reporting. The press is an
intermediary in public dialogue. Our changing demographics and pockets of
discontent seem to make for stronger arguments for press shields, not weaker
The comments of May, Finkelstein, et. al. seem to support this proposition.

External: false attribution, mischaracterization.
Internal: breeding internal conflict by making you *think* you have an

The ICC is an international court, judging _individuals_, not nation-states,

balk at the thought of somebody ripping a fellow-American out of the US

On the other hand, take Steele's concept, turn it into an distributed ghosty

private-private transcontinental intelligence flows, attain critical mass,
and you would have an exceptional value proposition.
Nothing happens without a value proposition, and there is only one lucrative
"live" information market: the intelligence habit. Whoever gets in the
middle of this public<-->private intelligence collision stands to make
serious bank. There is no legacy system, so, if doable, it's load and

I agree with you, I did not put forth my argument well, and I was lazy to
snip out context from several offlist conversations. And, you are correct,
it is difficult for me to make a compelling argument, due to the fact that I
am a far cry from an expert in this area. These are challenging concepts.
However, with respect, I did take on a mega-proposition for the application
of your concepts.
An appeal for a contract. I was trying to hypothesize a value proposition
for a legitimate application of these technologies. What you proposed, via a
"credit rating market," is an open source information mercantile system. I
was looking for a better market, which attaches high value to information:
intelligence. I wonder if these applications would find the most relevance
in the intelligence sector, despite thoughts of subversive applications. If
there is not a value proposition for an information marketplace between the
government and the private sector, there could be a value proposition within
the private sector intelligence channels, moving closer to your "credit
rating market" proposition.
We do have some most recent evidence of this.
However, Steele does have an interesting prototype community. Furthermore,
he has explored private sector opportunities as the intelligence community
restructures and privatizes.
But much strategically valuable information is not online. I said "NOT
ONLINE." The intelligence needed is in regard to third-world countries and
hotspots. This insight is damn sure not on the Net. I can't find the
intricacies in regard to [fill-in-the-blank] on the Net. There are some
things you can't mine. Even where you can, it's raw information, stale, and
not analysis. Furthermore, I would think this information is often of little
strategic value.
Yes. But when they get this information... "what does it mean?" They are
drowning in information that they can't make sense of. Any such an endeavor
would target information that is NOT SIPHONABLE AND OUTSIDE OF EXISTING
INTELLIGENCE FLOWS. The endeavor would tap the private intelligence sector,
developing nonexistent intelligence channels to tap private experts, agents,
analysts, primary sources, etc. - information available, but for a price.
Well, in the unlikely event the NSA and CIA folks are still around: They
need LESS noise - more private analysis and sourcepoint intelligence. The
problem with the US intelligence community, as seen by many, is that they
are over-focused on mass mining strategies and related technologies, and
need to re-focus on securing intelligence from the private sector.
Intelligence on resources, corporations, ETC. now that the Cold War is
That is an over-simplification, but yes. Intelligence is not headlines. To a
large extent, "what's happening" is not analyzed correctly, because the
intelligence community lacks sufficient expert analysis to cope with the
dataload. This capability is in the private sector. These information flows,
between the government sector and the private sector, are unmapped.
(I know I am just mouthing Steele's arguments, but I find them compelling.)
I'M TRYING.
Tim, I didn't expect you to make it all clear to me. (i.e., "Just lotsa
questions." Indeed, I have some answers, but thank you for the book recs.) I
was merely reflecting that anonymous cash is not a cure-all, and that it
might not even necessary for a highly sensitive information marketplace. I
was questioning the value proposition that you posed in the context of a
more sophisticated model -- an admittedly fantastical one. Finally, I
questioned if it was so fantastical, given Steele (et. al.) and thoughts of
functioning OSINT communities.
I can understand how conversations are frustrating for you, especially mine,
due to the level of my naiveti.
Still, you proffered an illicit "credit rating market" as a metaphor for an
information mercantile system tapping private, analytical intelligence --
intelligence that is not online, not siphonable or subject to mining, and
which lies outside legacy intelligence channels.
Is my value proposition so different than yours? I could argue that it
targets information of like character, in a like system, between parties of
like needs.
It remains to be seen if your "crypto-anarchy" can find a sustainable value
proposition. I was trying to envision one, usually necessary for somebody to
"do something." (This is your big bitch, no?)
You are a prickly, philosophical, violence-inclined prick tease that won't
put out for me. Clearly, I stand little chance of EVER getting into your
intellectual pants. Give me some indication of how good your dick really is,
because I'm thinking it isn't worth continued loss of blood on my end to
even entertain thoughts of pursuing such a long-term, high-risk,
book-reading, flesh-eating endeavor.
However, you have looked at this too long to have not considered
intelligence applications. If you say it's a really dumb idea, there is
probably some truth to it.

(Bear, read the entire before you reply...)
I said:
I want to paddle back to the kiddie pool, but I'll try to address you Bear,
you are way over my little head....and so is this subject matter.
Yes, but I'm still speaking of information that is not online, not
siphonable and locked in the overt experts in the private sector. It is not
"current events" or "happenings" or "what's going on." It's analysis and
intricacies that are critical for decision making. Not raw data or
intelligence headlines. It's Mr. X and his theories on Y, that nobody knows
about - Mr. X is hidden away in the private intelligence sector or some
university closet.
He's a specialist on ...uhm....South African Zulu Warrior Chieftains dress
and culture. He can tell you that when Zulus get in war dress and bring
knives and spears to your VIP meeting - it's a sign of respect, and not a
violence indicator. (I just ripped off the basics of this hypo from this
guy:  representative of the private
intelligence sector) Without knowing this information, your diplomatic
protection force is going to rat-tat-tat them to pieces and lead to a
"diplomatic snafu" of major proportions. They need this information NOW,
because the helicopter with your diplomat just landed in a remote area for
this roundtable in a big grass hut, and is facing 1,000 Zulu Warriors
jumping up and down and chanting in full war dress, and the protection force
of 5 is counting rounds in the back of their heads. Their protocol officer
fainted and is receiving medical assistance in the 'copter. They place a
call - decision time is 8-10 minutes. Somebody has got to finger and find
Mr. X's knowledge. This information is NOT online, not siphonable, outside
of regular intelligence channels - it's in Mr. X. Mr. X is one of five
western people in the world that know about these things.
Right then, Chief Zulu walks up and points his knife at your diplomat. Was
that a threat? Your diplomat pees in his pants in front of 1,000 Zulu
Warriors. Ramifications? BTW, your diplomat is also president of a
transcontinental resource-extractive company with operations in ZA and is a
top-level kidnapping and hostage risk - his capture or death would have
diplomatic ramifications and would affect upcoming treaty negotiations
related to the world diamond market.
National events often turn on intimate knowledge of the strangest facts -
these facts are known by people like Mr. X. You have 8 minutes to tell these
guys what to do. You can mine you data, use your CIA-google, ask your AI,
make some phone calls - and you are still whistling Dixie.
So, this is what you do: You CIA analyst, fire up your SIGINT/ELINT fed AI
and analysis programs, you call around.... What have those Zulu Warrior's
been talking about lately? You find, to your dismay, little
information....Zulus don't even use phones. So what do you do? You find
pictures of "Zulu War Dress" and some basic protocol. Your internal experts
agree. Your call: "Zulu War Dress = War = Aggression = take immediate
evasive action." You go look at online and offline sources on this
diplomat's diamond company. Sadly, you do not have an expert's competitive
intelligence analysis which would have told you this man is about to become
pivotal in the world diamond market, due to a secretly planned merger and
acquisition with a gem company. Because of this one man, the entire gem and
diamond markets are about to be revolutionized.
*bloody gunfire exchange* Confused Zulu Warriors. The chief was just giving
a sign of respect. Dead diplomat. Zulus go on the offensive. World diamond
market: kaput.
Mr. X happens to consult with PPS (private protection services) in ZA in
Zulu territory. Private intelligence. Yet, for some reason, Mr. X doesn't
appear on your screen. Why? Because you haven't developed information flows
between yourself and the private intelligence sector. By and large, you
don't talk to them. If you did, Mr. X's information would be in your system.
"Mr. X - expert in Zulu chieftain diplomacy." Additionally, you didn't know
about the diplomat's importance to the world diamond market, because you
don't have access to ZA's leading private competitive intelligence agency
profiles or their data bases (i.e. Grudko has a "WOLF" database, maybe he's
willing to sell some of that info, this info is not in YOUR data banks.)
I know that's "out there" and there are a thousand holes in this hypo, but
it gets my basic point across. Somebody smarter than me would have to give a
better hypo.
Your data flows are amazing quiet as to this little grass hut
situation...strangely, even though the future of the world diamond market
hinges upon it....
Okay, so you add in Zulu chief knife-pointing, diplomatic pissing...=
So, this isn't what I'm talking about.
Sometimes, a human, overt, expert analyst is the one thing you need, and
can't find. Our intelligence agencies are long on tricked out data
whatzits,... short on analysis and overt experts, because we haven't tapped
and mapped private sector capabilities, data and information flows. Again,
this information isn't headlines, it isn't online, it's in some Mr. X
somewhere. Sometimes OBSCURE, definitely not secret, and it's not a topic of
conversation ANYWHERE. This information is outside of your intelligence
channels and in hidden in the private intelligence sector.
But, what you say is still *very* relevant, because in my hypothetical
"Intellagora" - offering private sector analytical info for sale, exchange,
or free - you would need THIS capability.
Being the genius that you clearly are... I encourage you to read some Steele
thought, etc.:  mull it over, and
see what you can come up with...to give it "smarts." At this point, I need
kiddies floats, but the subject is "big enough" to interest you. I think my
hypo makes this sound more like a "phone directory of experts," or "data
mining" and that's not what I'm after..... Again, I apologize for my
flailing on the subject matter. Steele is better able to explain this
purported opportunity for an OSINT community or "Intel agora," and the
strategic benefits to intelligence agencies and the private intelligence
I appreciate your taking the time to give me some insight, you raised some

Ray & Tim, easy to see who said what:
Again, I'm trying to cut out all the lawyers, contracts and so forth, there
are other ways to regulate, but it's all variables: a combination of nym
alternative dispute resolution, escrow concepts (money, and ID) and
reputational systems. Participants can choose disclosed, an
agency-infomediary or a "zeroknowledge" participation level, and define who
they are comfortable dealing with... just what you guys talk about, and just
like real life.
Exactly, and this is where I run into trouble. However, as long as SOMEBODY
is accountable, the goat of the wrongdoer isn't always required for the
transacting party. I am more concerned about policing the community, but I
do think it's possible outside of traditional legal and transactional
frameworks, reverting back, as Tim made reference to (as I have I, damnit)
the old polycentric merchant society frameworks.
Eh, I was just trying to envision a live pitch opportunity. An intelligence
development contract seemed in the ballpark for serious bank, and
privatization changes might be breeding some opportunity. Clearly, an open
source information mercantile system is already making the intelligence
agenda. I find it "not unthinkable" that Tim's agora will first see the

The rapid acceptance of the spoliation theory out of CA has been in response
to digital data.
Lewy v. Remington Arms Co. 836 F.2d 1104 (8th Cir., 1998)
...Finally, the court should determine whether the document retention policy
was instituted in bad faith.  Gumbs v. International Harvester, Inc., 718
F.2d 88, 96 (3rd Cir. 1983) ("no unfavorable inference arises when the
circumstances indicate that the document or article in question has been
lost or accidentally destroyed, or where the failure to produce it is
otherwise properly accounted for."); Boyd v. Ozark Air Lines, Inc., 568 F.2d
50, 53 (8th Cir. 1977) ("We recognize, however, that the destruction of
business records may be sufficient to raise an unfavorable inference.").
...[note business records]...
In cases where a document retention policy is instituted in order to limit
damaging evidence available to potential plaintiffs, it may be proper to
give an instruction similar to the one requested by the Lewys. Similarly,
even if the court finds the policy to be reasonable given the nature of the
documents subject to the policy, the court may find that under the
particular circumstances certain documents should have been retained
notwithstanding the policy. For example, if the corporation knew or should
have known that the documents would become material at some point in the
future then such documents should have been preserved. Thus, a corporation
cannot blindly destroy documents and expect to be shielded by a seemingly
innocuous document retention policy.  Gumbs, 718 F.2d at 96 ("Such a
presumption or inference arises, however, only when the spoliation or
destruction [of evidence] was intentional, and indicates fraud and a desire
to suppress the truth, and it does not arise where the destruction was a
matter of routine with no fraudulent intent.") (quoting 29 Am. Jur. 2d
Evidence '  177 (1967)).
See also, In re Prudential Is. Co. Sales Practices Litigation, 169 F.R.D.
598 (D.N.J. 1997) ($1 million fine for negligent destruction); U.S. v. Koch
Industries Inc., 1998 WL 1744497 (N.D.Okla., 1998) (jury informed of
document destruction, and allowed to make inferences).
But see, Procter & Gamble Co. v. Haugen, 179 F.R.D. 622 (D.Utah, 1998)
(analyzing time element and refusing to find spoliation in absence of notice
of potential relevance or court order).
In a criminal context, U.S. v. Lundwall, S-1 97 Cr. 211 (S.D.N.Y. 1997)
(finding obstruction of justice):
...Defendants contend that they were not subpoenaed or directed by a court
to furnish the information sought by the Roberts plaintiffs in their
discovery requests. They also submit that the Indictment is overbroad,
charging them not only with concealing and destroying documents requested by
the Roberts plaintiffs, but also with concealing and destroying documents
likely to be requested by them. But the law is clear that neither a subpoena
nor a court order directing the production of documents must be issued or
served as a prerequisite to a '  1503 prosecution, and that the concealment
and destruction of documents likely to be sought by subpoena is actionable
under the statute. See, e.g., Ruggiero, 934 F.2d at 450 (destroying
documents in anticipation of a subpoena can constitute obstruction);
Gravely, 840 F.2d at 1160 (under '  1503, documents destroyed do not have to
be under subpoena; it is sufficient if the defendant is aware that the grand
jury will likely seek the documents in its investigation);

All we lawyer-types are saying is to engage the law in your problem-solving,
it's in your threat model. Many of your "solutions" are 100%
conflict-avoidance, or even ...conflict-ignorance. A strategic error. Where
there is a corpus, there is a law to get it. You always PLAN FOR CONFLICT.
Hence, we have _The Art Of War_ -- and not, _The Art Of Hiding_.
Hiding or secrecy as a total strategy has historically been limited by the
Rule Of Secrets/Least Safe Principle, and the equally-important "well,
doesn't this look suspicious!" -- a rule of natural law and human
disposition. Crypto is not a person, object and asset invisibility machine.
Until such a marvel comes to pass, stick to traditional wargaming.
THE SITUATION:
Controverted spies have brought you intelligence that the enemy has a new
long-range weapon. You learn that it works, but you think you lie outside
the current range. However, you learn that it is undergoing rapid
development and experimentation.
SOME OF YOUR RESPONSES:
"They're dumb, I hate them, and they can't hit us."
"IF they've never hit us, THEN they can't."
"They can't hit what they can't see."
"We should insult and burn the spies at the stake for bringing us this
"Bitch. Bitch. Bitch."
Within this particular range of hypotheticals, the courts are going to see a
problem and they might reach for spoliation. Arguing over the rightfulness
or wrongfulness of it is a futile exercise. When you learn your adversary is
using a new tactic or developing a new weapon, you examine your own tactics
and adjust them accordingly in ANTICIPATION OF CONFLICT. You assume they
will "get better" unless you do something about it. Given the nature of the
law, there is nothing to be done other than to prepare for advancement and
proliferation. The legal question is never what is - but what will be. In
this light, precedent is not "a rule," it is an aid for prediction.

opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself." -- Sun

The fact that Uni also instinctively reached for the concept, should tell

Just because something is distinguishable, doesn't mean it won't be
extrapolated. The judicial acceptance of spoliation has been rapid. Did you
read the cases? Did you shep them? Did you look at the adoption of corporate
electronic retention policies? Just making a point that there is a definite
trend of judicial acceptance and extrapolation. The history here is
revealing, and it isn't in the case law.
An important point is that the courts have validated electronic destruction.
They see it as a legitimate exercise to limit discovery fishing. That's a
positive utilitarian undercurrent that many of you aren't seeing, even
though you can't hide behind a policy. The courts are placing a good faith
burden on the person with the evidence. To what extent this will be applied
in a "personal papers" context - who knows?
As for your comments regarding Nixon, that was before spoliation was
"revived" by the courts in a digital context. The erosion of personal paper
protection and game theory also comes into play here. (I threw out a SSRN

If you read any of those cites and shep'd them, you will see there are
circumstances where
defendants didn't know the documents were relevant to a specific lawsuit.
There is support for the words "SHOULD HAVE KNOWN" might NOT equivocate to:
"a lawsuit has been filed." Nor even "expect a specific lawsuit."
Furthermore, in Lewy, they did adhere to a destruction policy and plaintiffs
got a jury instruction allowing for a negative inference. Does this tell you
Normally, you consider the following in a retention policy:
o pending or threatened litigation = easy answer, keep it.
o statute-specific retention requirements = easy answer....
o statutes of limitations = starts getting fuzzy here, usually the length of
the relationship, plus the limitations periods....
o real estate = long time.
o IP = forever.
o email = most say a few weeks, unless it is a complaint, etc.
It's not so simple as many think. It's document specific.
In certain cases, opponents may argue that the high-risk nature of certain
enterprises amounts to a state of continual pending or threatened
litigation, although non-specific in nature. They also may argue, as in
Lewy, that destruction pursuant to a retention policy and normal business
practice -- is not good enough. The court will look beyond the practice to
ask if the policy is reasonable GIVEN THE PARTICULAR NATURE OF THE DOCUMENT
AT ISSUE. The root of the matter is: SHOULD YOU HAVE KEPT IT? The court
seemed to infer in Lewy that the nature of the business and the likelihood
of litigation is a consideration.
..."We hold that there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could
find that Remington knew the M700 was dangerous. The following evidence was
before the jury: complaints from customers and gunsmiths that the Model 700
would fire upon release of safety, some of these complaints dating back as
far as the early 1970s; ....
.....Remington was unable to produce several documents that were destroyed
pursuant to Remington's "record retention policy." Remington argues that
destroying records pursuant to routine procedures does not provide an
inference adverse to the party that destroyed the documents.  Smith v.
Uniroyal, Inc., 420 F.2d 438, 442-43 (7th Cir. 1970).
The record reflects that Remington had its record retention policy in place
as early as 1970. In addition, the records that have been destroyed pursuant
to the policy -- complaints and gun examination reports -- were kept for a
period of three years and if no action regarding a particular record was
taken in that period it was destroyed. Vick v. Texas Employment Commission,
514 F.2d 734, 737 (5th Cir. 1975) (records destroyed pursuant to regulations
governing inactive records).
...First, the court should determine whether Remington's record retention
policy is reasonable considering the facts and circumstances surrounding the
relevant documents. For example, the court should determine whether a three
year retention policy is reasonable given the particular document. A three
year retention policy may be sufficient for documents such as appointment
books or telephone messages, but inadequate for documents such as customer
...Second, in making this determination the court may also consider whether
lawsuits concerning the complaint or related complaints have been filed, the
frequency of such complaints, and the magnitude of the complaints.
[i.e., not just lawsuits - complaints. The court probably wanted to know if
the defendant was on notice that this information would be sought in future
NON-SPECIFIC litigation.]
Finally, the court should determine whether the document retention policy
was instituted in bad faith.  Gumbs v. International Harvester, Inc., 718
F.2d 88, 96 (3rd Cir. 1983) ("no unfavorable inference arises when the
circumstances indicate that the document or article in question has been
lost or accidentally destroyed, or where the failure to produce it is
otherwise properly accounted for."); Boyd v. Ozark Air Lines, Inc., 568 F.2d
50, 53 (8th Cir. 1977) ("We recognize, however, that the destruction of
business records may be sufficient to raise an unfavorable inference."). In
cases where a document retention policy is instituted in order to limit
damaging evidence available to potential plaintiffs, it may be proper to
give an instruction similar to the one requested by the Lewys. Similarly,
even if the court finds the policy to be reasonable given the nature of the
documents subject to the policy, the court may find that under the
particular circumstances certain documents should have been retained
notwithstanding the policy.
For example, if the corporation knew or should have known that the documents
would become material at some point in the future then such documents should
have been preserved. Thus, a corporation cannot blindly destroy documents
and expect to be shielded by a seemingly innocuous document retention
policy.  Gumbs, 718 F.2d at 96 ("Such a presumption or inference arises,
however, only when the spoliation or destruction [of evidence] was
intentional, and indicates fraud and a desire to suppress the truth, and it
does not arise where the destruction was a matter of routine with no
fraudulent intent.") (quoting 29 Am. Jur. 2d Evidence '  177 (1967)).
In some high-risk endeavors, opponents may argue that destruction or
purposeful non-retention = fraudulent intent. I don't think Remington REALLY
wanted to keep those complaints 3 years, James. Ask yourself why they did
even that.
Look, we are just trying to envision what opponents are likely to try. The
outcome will depend on the facts.
Finally, the fact that a case (within the range of hypotheticals we have
discussed) has not arisen is not dispositive on the issue. If that were the
case, James, precedent would have no value, because the law could never move
forward. Indeed, precedent, by it's very nature usually involves something
novel. Otherwise, it wouldn't get to court, because everybody would know the

SURREPTITIOUS ENTRY WARRANTS.
Surreptitious entry warrants for silent video surveillance (outside of Title
I's "oral, wire or electronic communication") were approved in United States
v. Torres, 751 F.2d 875 (7th Cir. 1984). Defendants argued that secret video
surveillance was a 1984 Orwellian "telescreen" - and unconstitutional
pursuant to the fourth amendment. They lost. Defendants argued the warrant
authorizing the search did not satisfy the particularization requirements of
the fourth amendment. They lost. The Judge Posner held the warrant satisfied
Title III's 2518, and since those requirements "related" to the
constitutional requirements, the fourth amendment was satisfied. Courts have
adopted Torres. The bottom line on video surveillance is that the government
is required to show that "normal investigative techniques...reasonably
appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried." Most courts still view video
surveillance as outside of the ECPA. Judge Posner said, "There is no right
to be let alone while assembling bombs in safe houses." (Later courts
extended this to all Title I offenses.)
The requirements that emerge from the Torres line are: (1) probable cause in
respect to the person and criminal offense; (2) particular description in
the court order of the place and things that are to be viewed; (3)
minimization of the recording activities not related to the crime under
investigation; (4) that normal investigative techniques have failed in the
sense that they are unlikely to be successful or appear too dangerous; (5)
that the period of the surveillance be limited to that time necessary to
achieve the objective of the search or no longer than 30 days.
I find Torres analogous, and it is an example of how courts have considered
novel technologies and devices under Title I of the ECPA or "Title III."
GENERAL SEARCH/MINIMIZATION?
The minimization requirements of 2518(5) and the fourth amendments
prohibition on a "general search" were gutted in Scott v. United States, 436
U.S. 128 (1978), which rejected the view that monitors had to use good faith
efforts to minimize the surveillance of non-pertinent conversational
content. Scott factors: (1) the nature of the offense; (2) the type and
location of the device; (3) the nature of the non-pertinent conversations.
2510 INTERCEPTION?
Under Title I analysis the question is if there is an "intercept." See Steve
Jackson Games (email wasn't "in flight.") The government basically contends
they didn't get anything "in flight," as part of the *contemporaneous*
requirement. (And, what if they did? There is no suppression remedy for
electronic communications.) SJG is mentioned in Scarfo discussions, and SJG
is heavily criticized for it's circumventional nature since the ECPA was
meant to extend protection to electronic communications. However, the
possibility of the physical seizure of equipment was likely considered by
congress in 1986. (Were keystroke loggers?) Furthermore, all the cases cited
for the government's proposition in email, voicemail, etc. are basically
SJG - things that congress had knowledge of when they wrote the law. Mostly
before/after cases. A keystroke logger is a technical circumvention. If
upheld, that is a floodgate to eviscerate the protections afforded us under
the ECPA and congressional intent by outpacing what the law has had the
opportunity to consider.
INTERSTATE NEXUS?
They also changed Title III with the ECPA to address private carriers and
in-house private systems because THEY AFFECT INTERSTATE OR FOREIGN COMMERCE
(added clause under ECPA). (Previously, in house systems were exempt from
"wire communications," by "common carrier" language, and analyzed under the
"oral" provisions.) Today, in a like manner, "electronic communication"
includes any transfer.... transmitted by a ....SYSTEM...that _affects
interstate or foreign commerce_. See 2510(12). This was within one computer,
is that an "electronic communications system" 2510(14)? If so, the
government says there is no interstate commerce connection between your
keyboard and your computer.
The addition of 'interstate commerce' clause is often cited for the
proposition that Congress meant to *extend* protection to private systems.
(And a whole slew of cases exempting private systems under Title I now have
no precedential value.) However, the government cited a passage in the
congressional record to the contrary in regard to wire communications, but
I'm uncertain of the context of the specific testimony. I don't think the
same considerations apply to electronic communications.
A STAND-ALONE PIECE OF EQUIPMENT.
The Government argues that based on congressional testimony related to wire
communications (think telephone and aural), the definition of electronic
communications do not include transmissions in one piece of equipment
(interstate nexus).
The attached phone recorder hardware question, somewhat analogous under wire
communications, was settled by the "aural *or other*" addition to ECPA for
the definition of "intercept." (Previously, it had to an "aural acquisition"
to be an intercept.) Now, Title I treats nonmonitored recording as an
interception. Before, courts differed as to whether it was an "aural
acquisition" (Turk, 5th Cir.), or a "mere accessory designed to preserve the
contents of the communication" (United States v. Harpel, 493 F.2d 346, 350
(10th Cir.1974). I find that analogous as to congressional intent.
1. Title III was 1968. Today we have Title I, Title II & Title III of the
ECPA. The former Title III is Title I of the ECPA. Some courts refer to
Title I was the Wiretap Act and Title II as the Stored Communications Act.
Everybody still calls it "Title III."

Somebody asked:
The general identification and notice requirements of Title I are in Section
2518. 2518 delineates the procedures for applying for a court approved
interception of wire or oral communications, the content of applications,
the order(s) and the notice that must be sent after the fact to those
persons whose conversations were intercepted. Additionally, 2518(10)(a)
gives a right to suppress evidence under specified circumstances.
The inventory and notice requirement of 2518(8)(d) entitles only those
persons who were named in the court order to receive notice and inventory of
the wire tap as a matter of right. Notice to all other persons, even though
their conversations were overheard and they were identifiable is left to
judicial discretion. The prosecutor has the duty to classify all those whose
conversations have been intercepted and transmit this to the judge. If the
judge wants more information, the judge can ask for it so as to fulfill his
discretionary notice role.
In United States v. Kahn, 415 U.S. 143 (1974), 2518(1)(b)(iv) was
interpreted to mean that the only persons that must be named in a Title I
application are those the government has probable cause to believe are
involved in a criminal activity and will be using the target phone. So now
they don't really have to investigate other parties known to be using the
phone to see if they have probable cause for them or not. (This is "the
dragnet effect.")
Say you have a violation of the notice and inventory provision....the case
law tells you that the courts have made distinctions between violations that
are "central and substantive" - and those that are not (for the purpose of a
motion to suppress). In United States v. Donovan, 429 U.S. 413 (1977), the
court stated in dictum that the international failure to name individuals
for the purpose of hiding a lack of probable cause would be substantial. Yet
Donovan's footnotes have led lower courts to require the violation of the
notice and identification provisions be INTENTIONAL AND PREJUDICIAL to the
defendant to render it subject to a motion to suppress. It seems if the
defendant has ANY notice of whatever form - there is no prejudice.
Indeed, no effective check.

substantial connection. But the media didn't even take the pic - the police
did. I understand the article said he wasn't wanted, but that was still
highly suggestive and in bad taste considering the nature of the content.
See, e.g. Mertzger v. Dell Pub. Co 207 Misc. 182, 136 N.Y.S.2d 888

applications of face recognition technology. The Company will continue to
promote an improved public understanding of the creation, use and control of
facial recognition systems and will support public policy that ensures that
deployments of facial recognition are conducted in a way that upholds all
privacy rights." [...]
"Privacy rights" are based on legal doctrines, and not threats identifying
activities that are considered privacy-invasive to the average person. The
term "privacy rights" is not conducive to societal impact analysis or future
technological advances.
The International Biometric Industry Association position is that biometrics
is "electronic code" and not personal information:
 The IBIA has always advocated protective
legislation. For an idea of industry sentiment, the IBIA response to one
California bill is here:  (bill would

The push for legislation is pre-emptive in nature.

If a background picture is used for an article and it produces a substantial

gangs, falsely portrayed plaintiff as gang member). However, realize the
power of the First Amendment in more modern contexts.....
Still, I still consider it in very poor taste. The police are not the media.
Due to the concerns here, standards should be at the ceiling -- not the
legal floor. Was that a "permissible purpose?" Or was that a secondary
purpose the man did not anticipate when he walked past the "Smart CCTV"
sign? I would argue that under well-established privacy principles, that was
an impermissible use and secondary purpose. I don't think he anticipated
being used as a "model." Permissible purpose is the cornerstone of
information privacy.
Is one permissible purpose not in their operation and use policy? Obviously
not. Or, they ignored it. Or, nobody explained it to them.  Or, they just
didn't care? (Is the media report about how this came about deceptive?)
Look, I've got celebrities being subjected to CCTV bounties. I'm seeing
rogue surveillance footage on the Net as entertainment. Even wiretap
Any surveillance policy has to incorporate one permissible purpose. That
content should never leave the scope of the security purpose. I don't think
a "publicity purpose" qualifies. A subject's image is not marketing
material. Furthermore, access to material outside of the security purpose
and identified security personnel probably needs to include a subpoena. No,
not even for demonstration. Many people would have considered this an
incident of "data abuse."
At the surface, and based on the media reports (again, suspect) this looks
like a gross violation of public trust.

"The issue in this case is clouded and concealed by the very discussion of

call 'electronic surveillance'; but to equate the two is to treat man's
first gunpowder on the same level as the nuclear bomb. Electronic
surveillance is the greatest leveler of human privacy ever known. How most
forms of it can be held 'reasonable' within the Fourth Amendment is a
mystery." --- Justice Douglas, dissenting, United States v. White, 401 US.
745 (1971).
A keystroke is not a mere physical action - it is a contemporaneous
reflection of what is going on in your head. It is the contemporaneous
interception of mental processes. I am not just "typing," I am thinking. A
keystroke logger is akin to another recording device that is restricted for
these very reasons: the polygraph.
The ability to compose one's thoughts through writing, in private, should be
an inviolable sanctuary. The law enforcement interest in garnering a
passphrase to decrypt for the most heinous of criminal purposes pales in
comparison to the importance of forever precluding the government from
intruding on the genesis of human achievement at the sacred moment of its
inception: taking your thoughts to the written word.
As always, if they want it, they can come seize it, or intercept it.
Interception and seizure always was about giving the government an
opportunity to "get it." You took a risk by creating and having a document
in your possession for a meaningful length of time - at least SOME length of
time, or by "speaking your mind." Today, we press "SEND." You subjected your
thoughts or words to a meaningful exposure. Now, because of a "passphrase,"
the government would have the act of merely putting a pen to paper to
construct your thoughts require a similar act of courage.
Yes, what you write is subject to seizure. Still, there is an important
Surely, some drafts of constitutional provisions ended up in the embers of a
fire, and we will never know the thoughts of the author that were penned and
destroyed in private. To James Madison, a keystroke logger would look like a
"tattletale quill." Had there been "tattletale quills" back then, I wouldn't
be ranting about Scarfo, because we would have ever been afforded the
protections the Constitution. The thoughts leading to the Fourth Amendment
would have never seen parchment. Nor would have The Federalist Papers seen
ink. The Crown would have interloped between the men and their manuscripts.
Do you not realize the nature of this invasion! The government just turned a
man's writing utensil into a wired government informant! How can a fair
construction of the Fourth Amendment subject every American to question the
trustworthiness of their pen? To have your pen as a contemporaneous witness
against yourself?
We must preserve as inviolate what little remains of that same sanctity
between pen and paper that the Founders had when they framed their thoughts.
The sanctity I speak of is that "sense of security" in knowing that you have
the opportunity, no matter how brief or illusory, to consider your words
before rendering them available to the senses of others. That is the
wellspring of thought. Furthermore, are you not entitled to the same
forgiving fire James Madison had, should you be able to fairly avail
yourself of it?
Think of the great thought that would never have been -- but for handy
fires, and that _moment_ of sanctum when a man's pen hits his paper. At that
moment, the historic* meanings of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments don't "run
almost into each other," as in Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616 (1886),
they collide.

That's why I cited to Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616 (1886):
...The principal question, however, remains to be considered. Is a search
and seizure or, what is equivalent thereto, a compulsory production of a
man's private papers, to be used in evidence against him in a proceeding to
forfeit his property for alleged fraud against the revenue laws--is such a
proceeding for such a purpose an "unreasonable search and seizure" within
the meaning of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution?.... As before
stated, the Act of 1863 was the first Act in this country, and we might say
either in this country or in England, so far as we have been able to
ascertain, which authorized the search and seizure of a man's private papers
or the compulsory production of them, for the purpose of using them in
evidence against him in a criminal case, or in a proceeding to enforce the
forfeiture of his property. Even the Act under which the obnoxious writs of
assistance were issued did not go as far as this, but only authorized the
examination of ships and vessels and persons found therein, for the purpose
of finding goods prohibited to be imported or exported, or on which the
duties were not paid; and to enter into and search any suspected vaults,
cellars or warehouses for such goods. The search for and seizure of stolen
or forfeited goods or goods liable to duties and concealed to avoid the
payment thereof are totally different things from a search for and seizure
of a man's private books and papers for the purpose of obtaining information
therein contained, or of using them as evidence against him. The two things
differ toto coelo.

Discover (07/01); Wright, Karen
The U.S. Department of Defense is attempting to create a
better polygraph machine. The polygraph machine, which was
first introduced almost 100 years ago, is routinely used to
screen thousands of job applicants and government employees
every year, as well as in criminal investigations. In recent
times, however, the device's reputation has suffered from
claims that its use violates people's privacy and that it is
not always reliable. Over the last 24 months, the U.S.
Department of Defense has increased research on alternative
technologies through studies regulated by its Fort Jackson,
S.C.-based Polygraph Institute. Andrew Ryan, chief of research
at the institute, is working with the Johns Hopkins University
Applied Physics Laboratory to create software that can detect
minor variations in biofeedback to tell if someone is lying.
The institute is also looking into technologies that could
augment polygraph testing with techniques that are less
invasive. The U.S. Customs service has been testing a
remote-sensing device for the capture of smugglers, which
measures incriminating inflections, vibrations, and tones in a
person's voice. Muscle tremors might also provide indications
that someone is lying, and these can be detected using a
body-scanning laser, which also determines respiration and
heart rates. The level of blood flow, which can be configured
by measuring skin-surface temperature, might also change when
someone is lying: a recent pilot study using thermal imaging
cameras was able to detect a person lying 78 percent of the
time. (

If that ever becomes spousal-dateware, I bet they change their mind THEN.
Next, they will figure out a way to do that with keystroke dynamics (and
keystroke dynamic biometrics) and stop people lying on the Internet. The
death of us all!
See Long Beach City Employees Ass'n v. City of Long Beach, 41 Cal.3d 937,
719 P.2d 660 (1986), for a good explanation of why polygraphs are considered
more intrusive than a written or verbal interrogation.

Yes, it's true, we waited until 2001 to infiltrate your "email list" with
Jezebel Women and compromise your leaders. Our mission? To secure positions
of power and influence to prepare for the coming of "crypto-anarchy." Ah,
but we didn't count on the highly-developed counterintelligence skillset of
cypherpunk list members, much less the CPUNKOPSEC team led by An Metat. That
blew us up. You win. We give up.
If you let us go, we'll give you back your biometrics (we've got them all,
including keystroke dynamics - no, we don't need a keylogger), language
identifiers and friendship trees. We'll also release our hostages, and give
you the antidotes to our love potions -- but only in exchange for Choate.
We want to express our appreciation for the intelligence, and the ideas,
that you have provided the U.S. Government with over the years. This list
has been one of our most successful ops.
However, we discovered the list is no longer an asset. You stopped writing
code and turned into a bitch-tank full of bomb-talk and bimbo-bashing.
(We're da guvmint, we know how to make bombs, bitch and bimbo better than
you do.) You're not giving us good ideas. It's all "well-trod ground," you
see? Everything we need is in the archives. So, sadly, we must part ways,
pending certain "administrative paperwork."

Section 1831 Economic espionage
(a) In General - Whoever, intending or knowing that the offense will benefit
any foreign government, foreign instrumentality, or foreign agent,
knowingly -
(1) steals, or without authorization appropriates, takes, carries away, or
conceals, or by fraud, artifice, or deception obtains a trade secret;
(2) without authorization copies, duplicates, sketches, draws, photographs,

(3) receives, buys, or possesses a trade secret, knowing the same to have
been stolen or appropriated, obtained, or converted without authorization,
(4) attempts to commit any offense described in any of paragraphs (1)
through (3), or
(5) conspires with one or more other persons to commit any offense described
in any of paragraphs (1) through (3), and one or more of such persons do any
act to effect the object of the conspiracy, shall, except as provided in
subsection (b), be fined not more than $500,000 or imprisoned not more than
15 years, or both.
Section 1837 Applicability to conduct outside the United States
This chapter also applies to conduct occurring outside the United States if
(1) the offender is a natural person who is a citizen or permanent resident
alien of the United States, or an organization organized under the laws of
the United States or a State or political subdivision thereof-, or
(2) an act in furtherance of the offense was committed in the United States.
Your idea does seem to offer promise as a vehicle for treason, espionage,
trade secrets, malicious mischief, piracy, bribery of public officials,
concealment of assets, transmission of wagering information, murder for
hire, threatening or retaliating against Federal officials, a transactional
environment for nuclear and biologic weapons, narcotic and arms
trafficking....sweet spots. *shakes head*
This is not legal advice. It's an obituary. :)
I talked about this before, as an OSINT channel for the U.S. Government.
o BlackNet has legitimate intelligence applications.
o For it to work in a "secrets market," you would need to tap the ground
channels and have the analytics. Intelligence isn't a Chia pet..."just add
BlackNet and watch it grow!" Surely, untraceability does not equivocate to
instant source cultivation.
o You can get what you need by listening to the right person. Once you've
spotted and recruited the right person, THEN you need a transactional
channel, but only if you want to pursue a source relationship -- and you
usually do. You need analysis, not information. The problem isn't the lack
of a fence -- but the difficulty in defining your collection goals, spotting
the right person, knowing what to elicit, and having the analytics to refine
an intelligence product. Self-offerings are viewed with suspicion. Can a
third-party spot talent for you?  Talent: businessmen, academics and
informants. That's a very HUMAN high-touch problem.
o A holistic solution would cut down the costs of stealth, transfer risk,
and possibly would assist in spotting, but I don't know that zero-contact is
all it is represented to be. Is the equivalent of an anon e-bay going to
answer your strategic issues? You have to define and meet your collection
o Anonymity can be a problem. You need authentication. You would like
blinded biometrics.
o I would think the ROI would be where you can shoehorn into existing
intelligence channels and groundwork. That's either a sovereign, an
intermediary wrapped in the skirts of a sovereign, a defense contractor, or
an untouchable intermediary. If not bona-fide intelligence, you're left with
the criminal element, IRA and so forth. Most move product and still have
distribution channels. Yeah, the IRA would like digital cash, they are
buying arms with offshore debit cards.
o It seems like _damn bad timing_ for a discussion in this context. This
should be couched in terms of a beneficial application, rather than
something subversive. It's like the fall of Knights Templar in here. What
happened to the pilgrims' safe passage?

The EEA wasn't passed until 96. I failed to mention Title 18 United States

"Agents kick crypto ass."

reliable source information indicated....Also in the Fall of 2000, reliable
source information.... The encrypted messages, which were decrypted by the
U.S. government,.... On June 21, 2001, Regan sent an email from an account
registered in his own name to an email account in the name of his wife. The
email attached one page of alphanumeric encryption key that appears to be
similar to the encryption technique described in paragraphs 10, 11 and 12,
above....Regan was confronted by FBI special agents at the airport at
approximately 5:35 p.m. In response to a question from this affiant, Regan
denied knowledge of cryptology, coding and decoding. However, when shown
photographs of the alphanumeric tables, which appear to be related to
cryptology, which tables had been in his carry-on bag, he stated "This is my
stuff." Regan was arrested shortly thereafter....Also in Regan's carry-on
bag when he was stopped by the FBI at Dulles Airport on August 23, 2001, was
a hand-held global positioning system ("GPS"). Based on my training and
experience in intelligence matters, I know that a GPS unit can be used to
locate a specific site for drop or signal sites."

[1] "This paper examines the potential for electronic communication to spark
mass hate such as that seen in colonial Salem and during the McCarthy
[2] "The elements which go into the development of mass hate include the
following: 1) strains on the community through the recognition of a moral
boundary crisis and identification of villains, 2) crystallizing of
patterned labelling through a degradation ceremony, 3) appropriation of the
social apparatus and suppression of critique mechanisms, 4) restoration of a

could be asking the wrong questions, and was receptive of any insight. It
was also a reference the number of mysterious queries that flow across the

Or, no slope ... according to some people's opinions of the International
Criminal Court. Many say we will be yielding our sovereignty, our
Constitution, and our procedural protections to this Court. (ICC advocates,
on the other hand, are quick to point out concord between the ICC and the US
Constitution:  .)
The ICC is an international court, judging _individuals_, not nation-states,
in regard to:
"the crime of genocide; crimes against humanity; war crimes; and the crime
of aggression." Many have expressed concern over subsequent extensions of
the Court's subject matter jurisdiction.  One commentator stated that even
if a nation is not a party to the Rome Statute, the ICC can still
investigate a crime within that nation according to ICC rules. [I haven't

Which illustrates that a crime is a legal wrong as defined by the sovereign.
Otherwise, what Jim said. I could add some legalese, but who wants that.
Your questions regarding semantics are highly relevant. The ICC is tangled
up in definitions of "the crime of aggression" at the moment. As far as the
definition of humanity, I'm not going to bite that.
Many nations feel that it will be used by the few, or the many, as a
political vehicle. Others fear the Court will extend it's subject matter
jurisdiction after gaining acceptance. The last 3 signatures before the Dec.
31 deadline were....Iran...Israel...US (Clinton on his way out - but don't
look for it getting past the Senate. The US Military is violently opposed.)
In the realm of lunatic possibilities, I can think of several areas where
there might be an interest in extending the Court's subject matter
jurisdiction to include other common denominators of criminality, according
to the majority world viewpoint, but I question if this would be undertaken.
Finding base emotional common denominators are easy, (using children as
shields, for example) but notions of criminality, and viewpoints regarding
the application of justice are anything but universal.
Since the traditional place of the sovereign is between the individual and
other nation-states, many view the ICC's "directness" as a significant
encroachment on sovereignty, and some say it's meant to be a restraint on
progress of a revolutionary nature. (ie corruption: make unfounded
allegations against a rebel leader, a foreign military force in residence,
Cypherpunks illustrate the importance of a "sheltering sovereign," and how
ideas can mature, take tangible form, and spread to other nation-states,
especially in a networked society. Many of the ideas put forth in this forum
would benefit from a criminal nation-state, a misnomer that includes a
spectrum running from liberty/tax havens to terrorist harbors. So, in my
naive view, anything that is viewed as an encroachment on sovereignty (or
asylum) has some relevance here.
[The ICC is a very politicized topic. I've been chewing at both ends of the
pro/con stick, which are equally sensational in nature. I'm certainly no
expert in foreign relations, or the ICC, so I encourage anybody interested
in this issue to do the same, and form their own opinion.]

< "time to liberate the Brits..."
Makes you want to dress up like an Indian, storm aboard a moored British
sailing vessel, and chunk cargo into the harbor, doesn't it? Domestic
"property" terrorism is increasingly directed at corporate/private
interests; and you see those interests addressed in spades here.
Section 19 creates an affirmative duty to disclose information to
authorities if the information is "suspicious" as to past or future
violations of Sect. 15-18. The duty to fink is limited to a business or
quasi-business relationship, defined as Âinformation which comes to his
attention in the course of a trade, profession, business or employmentÂ.
Under the old UK terrorism law [read: IRA], the acts had to be political,
now they can be religious or ideological [read: ELF, ALF - speaking of
which, is there a Privacy Liberation Front?]).
Act @ Definition of Terrorism under TA2000
"1. - (1) In this Act "terrorism" means the use or threat of action where-
(a) the action falls within subsection (2),
(b) the use or threat is designed to influence the government or to
intimidate the public or a section of the public, and
(c) the use or threat is made for the purpose of advancing a political,
religious or ideological cause.
(2) Action falls within this subsection if it-
(a) involves serious violence against a person,
(b) involves serious damage to property,
(c) endangers a person's life, other than that of the person committing the
(d) creates a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a

Some of Florida's convicted criminals are under constant
supervision without being housed in prisons, thanks to the use of
Global Positioning System (GPS). The system, which is currently
monitoring 600 convicts in Florida, uses a satellite, and can be
programmed to alert authorities when a sex offender, for
instance, is going near a schoolyard. GPS tracking is more
effective than the old electronic monitoring system, which many
states still employ. The new technology can locate the offender
from room to room within a house, or on a street corner. However,
probation officers will still have to physically check on persons
who are on the program, which lasts about two years. The new
system costs $9.17 per day, compared to $50 a day for an state
prison-housed inmate, or $3 per day for conventional electronic
monitoring. ( Source: NLECTC Law Enforcement

COMMONWEALTH vs. MICHAEL J. HYDE
July 13, 2001
GREANEY, J.
The relevant facts are not in dispute. On October 26, 1998, just after 10:30
P.M., an Abington police officer stopped the defendant's white Porsche,
because the automobile had an excessively loud exhaust system and an unlit
rear registration plate light. Three other Abington police officers arrived
shortly thereafter and the stop quickly became confrontational.(1) During
the course of the stop, which lasted approximately fifteen to twenty
minutes, the defendant and his passenger, Daniel Hartesty, were ordered out
of the automobile, and Hartesty was pat frisked. One officer reached into
the automobile, picked up a plastic shopping bag that lay on the floor by
the passenger seat, and looked inside. (The bag contained compact discs.) At
one point, the defendant stated that the stop was "a bunch of bullshit," and
that he had been stopped because of his long hair. One officer responded,
"Don't lay that shit on me." Later, another officer called the defendant "an
asshole." The defendant was asked whether he had any "blow" (cocaine) in the
car. At the conclusion of the stop, the defendant and Hartesty were allowed
to leave. No traffic citation was issued to the defendant, and the defendant
was not charged with any crime. According to the testimony of one police
officer, the defendant was "almost out of control" and the stop "had gone so
sour," that it was deemed in everyone's interest simply to give the
defendant a verbal warning. Unbeknownst to the officers, however, the
defendant had activated a hand-held tape recorder at the inception of the
stop and had recorded the entire encounter.
The judge (the same judge who had ordered that the complaint issue) rejected
the defendant's argument and denied the motion to dismiss. The judge
reasoned that the definition of "oral communication" under G. L. c. 272, '
99 B 2 ("speech, except such speech as is transmitted over public air waves
by radio or other similar device"), was clear, and, unlike the definition in
the Federal electronic surveillance statute,(2) did not require an
expectation of privacy by the speaker in order to make the statute
applicable. He concluded that the Massachusetts statute prohibited the
secret tape recording of the police officers' speech. The defendant was
tried before a jury and convicted of four counts of violating G. L. c. 272,
' 99.
The dissent reaches its conclusion by ignoring the unambiguous language and
definitions of the statute and by relying on purported (and dubious)
legislative history. The dissent suggests that the defendant's secret
recording of the words of the police officers should be lawful, because such
recording may tend to hold police officers accountable for improper
behavior. Implicit in the dissent's position is the even broader suggestion
that police officers routinely act illegally or abusively, to the degree
that public policy strongly requires documentation of details of contacts
between the police and members of the public to protect important rights. We
doubt the validity of the dissent's major premise, and we are not convinced
that the widespread clandestine recording of encounters between individuals
and police officers would be desirable or even efficacious.(9) Nor do we
think, as the dissent does, that police officers should be singled out for
particular approbation to safeguard the integrity of the "Republic." Post at
. Followed to its logical conclusion, the dissent would encourage drug
manufacturers to mount hidden video cameras in their facilities so they can
capture the moment of truth when the police execute a search warrant and
would authorize drug dealers secretly to tape record conversations with
suspected undercover officers or with informants in order to protect the
dealers' rights against hypothetical police abuse. Numerous other examples
exist. The point is an obvious one. Every police encounter would be
available for secret recording; even meter maids would not be spared. The
value of obtaining probative evidence of occasional official misconduct does
not justify a failure to enforce the clear terms of the statute. See
Commonwealth v. Blood, 400 Mass. 61, 74 (1987), and cases cited.
Further, if the tape recording here is deemed proper on the ground that
public officials are involved, then the door is opened even wider to
electronic "bugging" or secret audio tape recording (both are prohibited by
the statute and both are indistinguishable in the injury they inflict) of
virtually every encounter or meeting between a person and a public official,
whether the meeting or encounter is one that is stressful (like the one in
this case or, perhaps, a session with a tax auditor) or nonstressful (like a
routine meeting between a parent and a teacher in a public school to discuss
a good student's progress). The door once opened would be hard to close, and
the result would contravene the statute's broad purpose and the
Legislature's clear prohibition of all secret interceptions and recordings
by private citizens....
As discussed above, however, our Legislature chose not to follow those
States whose statutes prohibit wiretapping or secret electronic recording
based on privacy rights. See notes 5 and 6, supra. "If the Legislature had
intended to [prohibit only secret recording where an individual has a
reasonable expectation of privacy], the statute would have been written in
terms similar to those used in the California eavesdropping statute . . . .
Rather, it is apparent from the Report of the Special Commission on
Electronic Eavesdropping, 1968 Senate Doc. No. 1132, that the legislative
intent was to impose more stringent restrictions on the use of electronic
surveillance devices by private individuals than is done in other States."
(5) Every State, with the exception of Vermont, has some type of
eavesdropping or wiretapping statute. The majority contain language that, to
some degree, prohibits only the surreptitious recording of another's words
when spoken with a reasonable expectation of privacy. See, e.g., Ala. Code '
42.20.300 (Michie 1996) (Alabama; "private communication"); Ga. Code Ann. '
16-11-60 (Michie 1996) (Georgia; "in private place"); Mich. Comp. Laws '
750.539a (1996) (Michigan; "private discourse of others"); N.H. Rev. Stat.
Ann. ' 570-A: 1 (1995) (New Hampshire; "uttered by a person exhibiting an
expectation that such communication is not subject to interception under
circumstances justifying such expectation"). In addition, as recognized by
the judge in his memorandum denying the defendant's motion to dismiss, the
Federal electronic surveillance statute, see note 2, supra, similarly limits
"oral communication" to the speech of a person who holds a justifiable
expectation that it will not be subject to interception. For an extensive
discussion of various State electronic surveillance statutes, see C. Bast,
What's Bugging You? Inconsistencies and Irrationalities of the Law of
Eavesdropping, 47 DePaul L. Rev. 837, 868-881 (1998).
(6) The defendant cites State v. Flora, 68 Wash. App. 802, 806 (1992), in
which the Court of Appeals of Washington held, on nearly identical facts,
that an arrestee's attempt to use a tape recorder to record his arrest did
not violate Washington's electronic surveillance statute, because the police
officers had no reasonable expectation of privacy in their words. This case
is inapposite, however, because the Washington electronic surveillance
statute prohibits only the secret recording of private conversations, see
Wash. Rev. Code Ann. ' 9.73.030 (1) (b) (2000). Accord Commonwealth v.
Henlen, 522 Pa. 514, 517 (1989) (secret recording of interrogation by prison
guard suspected of theft did not violate Pennsylvania's electronic
surveillance statute, because interrogating officer had no justifiable
expectation of privacy). See 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. ' 5702 (2000) (defining
"oral communications" as "any oral communication uttered by a person
possessing an expectation that such communication is not subject to
interception under circumstances justifying such expectation").
Because our own statute broadly prohibits the interception of speech (except
that which is transmitted over public air waves), see G. L. c. 272, ' 99 B
2, whether the police officers possessed privacy interests in their words
spoken in the course of performing their public duties, or whether the
encounter constituted a routine traffic stop or a custodial interrogation,
as argued by the defendant, are issues that we need not address.
Consideration of such issues would only be warranted in a civil suit for
damages under G. L. c. 272, ' 99 Q, which allows actual and punitive
damages, as well as attorneys fees, for:
"any aggrieved person whose oral or wire communications were intercepted,
disclosed, or used except as permitted or authorized by this section or
whose personal or property interests or privacy were violated by means of an
interception except as permitted or authorized by this section shall have a
civil cause of action against any person who so intercepts, discloses or
uses such communications or who so violates his personal, property or
privacy interest . . . ." (Emphasis added).
(9) Although we have stated that the electronic recording by the police of
interrogations is a good practice, see Commonwealth v. Diaz, 422 Mass. 269,
271-273 (1996), by no stretch of the imagination did we suggest that it is
desirable for citizens to intercept or record electronically the speech of
others, including police officers, without their knowledge. We presume that,
when police interrogations are electronically recorded, the suspect is aware
that the interrogation is being preserved.
(10) Although not cited by the parties, in People v. Beardsley, 115 Ill. 2d
47 (1986), a defendant appealed from his conviction of eavesdropping when,
having been arrested and placed in the rear seat of a squad car, he secretly
tape recorded the conversation of two police officers who sat in the front
seat. See id. at 49. The Supreme Court of Illinois reversed the defendant's
conviction, holding that, although the plain language of the Illinois
eavesdropping statute prohibited the recording of "all or any part of any
conversation" without consent, Ill. Ann. Stat. c. 38, ' 14-2 (a) (1) (1983),
the statute must have been intended to protect individuals only from the
surreptitious monitoring of conversations of a private nature. See id. at 53
(reasoning that, because officers were aware that the defendant was in a
position to overhear, their conversation was not private). The Illinois
Legislature, however, subsequently amended the statute to define
"conversation" as "any oral communication between 2 or more persons
regardless of whether one or more of the parties intended their
communication to be of a private nature." 720 Ill. Comp. Stat. ' 5/14-1(d)
(West 1996). See People v. Nestrock, 316 Ill. App. 3d 1, 7 (2000).
MARSHALL, C.J. (dissenting, with whom Cordy, J., joins).
Many States have wiretapping statutes similar to the one enacted in 1968 in
Massachusetts.(10) In only one reported decision has a State attempted to
indict a citizen in circumstances similar to those in this case. The attempt
was summarily rejected. In State v. Flora, 68 Wash. App. 802 (1992), the
court overturned a conviction obtained in circumstances nearly identical to
these and under a wiretapping statute similar to the one at issue here. The
Flora court rejected as "wholly without merit" the view now adopted by this
court. Id. at 806. The court "decline[d] the State's invitation" to
transform its wiretapping statute "into a sword available for use against
individuals by public officers acting in their official capacity." Id. at
The court suggests, ante at , that a different reading would permit
"untrammeled interception of communications" of government officials by
everyone and anyone. That concern is misplaced. There is a difference in
kind, well recognized in our jurisprudence, between police officers, who
have the authority to command citizens, take them into custody, and to use
physical force against them, and other public officials who do not possess
such awesome powers.(14) We hold police officers to a higher standard of
conduct than other public employees, and their privacy interests are
concomitantly reduced. See, e.g., O'Connor v. Police Comm'r of Boston, 408
Mass. 324, 328-329 (1990) ("public confidence in the police is a social
necessity and is enhanced by procedures that deter [unlawful police
conduct]"); Broderick v. Police Comm'r of Boston, 368 Mass. 33, 42 (1975),
quoting Gardner v. Broderick, 392 U.S. 273, 277-278 (1968) (police officer
"is a trustee of the public interest, bearing the burden of great and total
responsibility to his public employer"). We hold officers to this higher
standard of conduct, fully confident that, in most cases, they will meet
that standard, and there is no "implicit" suggestion to the contrary. Ante
at . It is the recognition of the potential for abuse of power that has
caused our society, and law enforcement leadership, to insist that citizens
have the right to demand the most of those who hold such awesome powers.(15)

You might find it interesting that a number of states are considering (or

and exceptions for prisons, security and "law enforcement engaged in
investigation." Some include public CCTV notice requirements and privacy
expectations defined by location.
TX HB 1040 @
Others are closer to this Arizona bill, addressing visual surveillance in
public places. This is a bare statute with no mention of a privacy interest.
It exempts "professional journalists," seemingly defined so as to exclude
independent journalists. Bills like this could be construed to restrain the
use of visual surveillance at protests, and in other situations that involve
disparate bargaining power and government overreaching.

@ As for bad guys recording... The REAL bad guys usually don't want to be
recorded, which is why they have taken up bodywear countermeasures. At any
rate, criminal laws are only a deterrent to law-abiders. (Our electronic
surveillance statutes are, to a significant extent, the legacy of political
espionage. They were protecting themselves -- against themselves.)
Miniaturization, affordability and availability has made *covert*
surveillance a viable protective strategy for citizens. (i.e., "Tape is the
best testimony.") One-party recording statutes are in recognition of this
protective interest.
Recording statutes, especially the new visual recording and "paparazzi"
bills are deserving of scrutiny, even though many are *extremely*
well-intentioned. Not only do they increasingly implicate the First
Amendment, they risk limiting the citizen-use of legitimate, protective
covert surveillance in certain circumstances involving citizen/government

I seem to remember some AEDPA discussions in the archives. AEDPA provides
that all persons within or subject to US jurisdiction are forbidden from
"knowingly providing material support or resources" to designated FTOs

so it has been the subject of some FISA-like controversy. This case
concerned the designation of an "alter ego" FTO, and is interesting from
several angles.

To oversimplify, assume the Secretary gives notice to one of the entities
We are considering designating you as a foreign terrorist organization, and
in addition to classified information, we will be using the following
summarized administrative record. You have the right to come forward with
any other evidence you may have that you are not a foreign terrorist
It is not immediately apparent how the foreign policy goals of the
government in general and the Secretary in particular would be inherently
impaired by that notice. It is particular- ly difficult to discern how such
a notice could interfere with the Secretary's legitimate goals were it
presented to an entity such as the PMOI concerning its redesignation. We
recog- nize, as we have recognized before, that items of classified
information which do not appear dangerous or perhaps even important to
judges might "make all too much sense to a foreign counterintelligence
specialist who could learn much about this nation's intelligence-gathering
capabilities from what these documents revealed about sources and methods."
Yunis, 867 F.2d at 623. We extend that recognition to the possibility that
alerting a previously undesignated organiza- tion to the impending
designation as a foreign terrorist organization might work harm to this
county's foreign policy goals in ways that the court would not immediately
perceive. We therefore wish to make plain that we do not foreclose the
possibility of the Secretary, in an appropriate case, demon- strating the
necessity of withholding all notice and all oppor- tunity to present
evidence until the designation is already made. The difficulty with that in
the present case is that the Secretary has made no attempt at such a
We therefore hold that the Secretary must afford the limited due process
available to the putative foreign terrorist organization prior to the
deprivation worked by designating that entity as such with its attendant
consequences, unless he can make a showing of particularized need.

"U.S. Developing 'Remote Frisk' to Seek Weapons in a Crowd"
Cox News Service (06/07/01); Emling, Shelley
NLECTC Law Enforcement & Corrections\Copyright 2001, Information Inc.,
Bethesda, MD.
Engineers at the National Institute of Standards and
Technology's laboratories in Boulder, Colo., are developing a
device that police might one day use to spot people carrying
dangerous weapons in unruly crowds. While engineers will
likely develop a working prototype by year's end, U.S.
officials have no immediate plans for deploying the system.
The National Institute of Justice and the Federal Aviation
Administration is funding the development of the "remote
frisk," and the agencies have already spent about $200,000
annually on the project over the past three years. News of the
system comes during a growing concern over domestic terrorism,
but it also raises concerns over the constitutionality of
high-tech policing practices. Kristian Miccio at Western State
University College of Law in California says that using
high-tech devices among crowds is a violation of the Fourth
Amendment, an issue similar to a recent Supreme Court ruling
involving an Oregon man. Rebecca Trexler, an FAA spokeswoman,
says the FAA has reservations about a scanner that could peer
through clothing. NIST spokesman Fred McGehan states that the
agencies hope the device would provide only a rough silhouette
of the person's body. (
I note that a sizable industry is dedicated to not only keeping my
silhouette private through advanced camoflauge techniques, but also morphing
it out of its natural proportion.
Can it detect a body-bound knife? A grenade? A minute explosive device? A
"push-up" bra? Does their "rough silhouette" subject me to the same exacting
tracing knife as those reclining ladies on 18-wheeler mud flaps? (Is this
blue paint?)

intelligence collection systems whose fruits cannot be harvested, and we are
about to waste $60 billion over ten years recapitalizing these same secret
technical collection systems, so that we might collect 100 times more
information, and process still less of it."
o "The center of gravity for both national security and national prosperity
lie now in the private sector and its intellectual property as well as its
accumulated knowledge.  The concepts of noosphere (Pierre Tielhard de
Chardin) and "world brain" (H.G. Wells) are now an imminent reality, and the
World Intelligence Center envisioned by Quincy Wright is achievable."
o "Eighth, the President must eliminate export restrictions on encryption
and recognize that the greatest opportunity of all faces us.  We can raise
the Internet's security level to where it can handle Presidential
communications.  The moment we do that, we embrace the world and make it
possible for an extraordinary variety of multilateral relationships to bloom

by the BASPs early on. Given the choice, a BASP would naturally want to own
and control that data, as ultimately this may be its most valuable asset.
However, the desire of the BASPs to own the data will not go unchallenged.
Enterprises tend to be wary of losing control and very reluctant to hand
over their customers data to a third party. The privacy concerns of the
consumer and the associated liability will be considerations that will
bolster an enterprises reluctance to relinquish control.
One option for a BASP could be to reach the end-user directly and build a
database of biometric templates. However, this requires offering a clear
value proposition to consumers to entice them to enroll their templates and
this may be a costly process."

@_subject: DoJ subpoena guidelines for journalists | Confidential 
Even the most aggressive of news organizations roll-over, often contrary to
their internal policies. It is their token defense of journalists that has
led to the continued erosion of shield laws and the First Amendment. (I
don't know that Declan is a member of the subpo club yet, but I'm sure the
opportunity will present itself.)
[IS IT PRESS?]
Choate said:
But all speech is not equal. In fact, there is precedent running the other
direction. (Indeed, Jim, precedent runs in the other direction for most of
your arguments. I don't mean this disrespectfully.) For example, media
defined as "persons who gather and disseminate news on an ongoing basis as
part of the organized, traditional, mass media." Matera v. Superior Court,
170 Ariz. 446, 448, 825 P.2d 971, 973 (Ct. App. 1992) (holding that
professional author writing a book about the "AzScam" sting operation was
not a member of the media and thus was not protected by the shield statute).
First Amendment mileage in your state may vary. Nontraditional media, such
as online collaborative media, might not receive the benefit of state shield
statutes. Other sites might be seen as collections, rather than "media." It
probably wouldn't hurt to construct a web site, both in form and content, in
a fashion designed to give one the best shot at the benefit of state shield
laws (where applicable) and weighty First Amendment press considerations.
[CONFIDENTIAL SOURCE STATUS - Related topic]
Many of you work in sensitive positions, or are otherwise close to
controversy. The following are considerations for a confidential
reporter-source agreement, which I thought might be of tangential interest
(many reporters won't deal with "nym sources":
o confidential source (not "off the record")
o reporter's scope of authority/authorization to commit (maybe it's an
o one-time or continuing reporter-source agreement
o ID disclosure to editor (and do you trust THIS GUY?)
o use of attribution
o use of quotes (normally, you want them to paraphrase you)
o indicia of affiliation, sex, and other identifying characteristics
o public disclosure of your motive/interest, agreed-upon motive/interest
o scope of purpose and use ("deep background" only?)
o timing of publication, scope of publication (good luck)
o confirmation from multiple sources (lead source or primary source?)
o means of contact, communication protocol (Subpoena trick: go for third
party communication routes, cell phone provider, etc. to run around the
journalist and the shield laws.)
o handling of notes, documentation and memoranda (commingling, destruction,
o limitations: you lie, a lawsuit results, criminal investigation
o legal defense provisions
o opportunity to confirm/review/refute (forget it)
o legal recourse / liquidated damages
(misc. boilerplate blah-blah)
Most of the above assumes you are giving them "THE STORY OF THE CENTURY."
o If you achieve the _miracle_ of confidential source status: DON'T LIE.
Don't even embellish.
o While there is some support for legal recourse against the
reporter/newspaper, it will probably be of little consolation.
o State shield laws vary. State case law varies. "It depends." The law may
require disclosure. Secure legal counsel and find out, certainly in a
criminal matter.
o Is it a REAL investigative reporter? They know how to protect confidential
o The reporter must justify why you deserve this status to those on-high --
why you should be trusted. Sow your fields ahead of time.
o Go with a reporter you trust (or a reporter with an reputational interest
in your community - plug for Declan). I would go with some small newspapers
before some major news orgs, many of which have horrific track records in
this regard. It's the reporter that sits in jail for you. Ask around
 and  .
o Is there another way to get this information to the reporter with a
credible, named source?
I certainly don't represent myself as an expert in this area, and it's been
a while since I had cause to review it. ;-)
Disclaimer: "This is not legal advice because you didn't pay me for it. It's
general information. It's probably ill-suited to any particular situation
you might have. You always need a lawyer. Always. You should take your

You gnaw at a branch and call it a root. You have common law (the law of
common men, lex communis), and legislative law (bringing the law of the
sovereign). Common law precedent is an aggregate body of knowledge
consisting not only decisions, but of logical constructs -- a way of
approaching and framing legal thought. Common law has never been codified in
a document, it's a body of relational knowledge. The Constitution is not the
primary authority, because constitutions (legislative law) are not the root
of what you see as law. Indeed, the US Const. finds root in common law and
common right.
Lex est ab eterno.

"...and it is to this last, they say, that the masses have owed their
strength most of all, since, when the democracy is master of the
voting-power, it is master of the constitution. Moreover, since the laws
were not drawn up in simple and explicit terms .... disputes inevitably
occurred, and the courts had to decide in every matter, whether public or
private .... The Thesmothetae were many years afterwards, when these offices
had already become annual, with the object that they might publicly record

JIM CHOATE, PLAINTIFF 	'
AIMEE FARR, DEFENDANT	'
MOTION TO QUASH CONSTITUTIONAL CHOATIAN THREADS
TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF CYPHERPUNKS:
NOW COMES ~Aimee, hereinafter referred to as "Defendant," and files this
Motion To Dissolve Constitutional Choatian Threads and would show:
1. Whereas Defendant is alleged to "draw" constitutional false distinctions,
Plaintiff "doodles" them.
2. Defendant's aim was to give Plaintiff some historical context for legal
delineations, which have become blurred over the ages (and marred by legal
authorship blinded by egocentric political/time views).
Chieftain-king-sovereign-legislative law deals with the individual<-->"king"
relationship. Ancient common law is man<-->man law, arising out of custom
and usage. While common law no longer plays the role it once did (being
usurped by statutory/legislative law) some distinctions remain that were
carried over into English common law. Furthermore, Defendant would show that
not every legal question invokes the purview of the US Const., because it
lies outside of the individual<-->"king" relationship, and even our enhanced
interpretations of the same. In a historical context, "legislative law"
(Lat. "bringing law") *includes* constitutional law, and is therefore not a
false distinction, although perhaps a modern linguistic misnomer. Defendant
went as far back as Aristotle, before many legal divergences.
3. Plaintiff ignores the role of the courts and treats the US Const. as the
wellspring of ALL law in this country. It is the wellspring of many things,
(indeed, more than The Framers ever contemplated) but it is not the singular
Garden of Eden for all U.S. jurisprudence. Plaintiff repeatedly
mischaracterizes political opinion as legal argument, and proffers arguments
based on his own "tarot card reading" of the U.S. Constitution.
4. Plaintiff's constitutional questions grow like kudzu...wandering, in the
opinion of many, far from any questions of direct and particular relevance
to this forum. Plaintiff should pick up some law outlines/bar reviews and go
beyond the letter of the Constitution and the words of the founding fathers.
Plaintiff should take some courses, join some *constitutional law mailing
lists*, and multidisciplinary legal societies to broaden Plaintiff's frame
of reference so he may entertain more complex constitutional analysis, and
pose questions that are more likely to be of interest to IAAL and IANAL

Kevin, I think, said:
Civil law and common law are distinct and oppositional terms. At least they
were once. I don't think you could find a "pure" legal tradition in
developed nations, at least not under my understanding of these polluted
concepts. (Note: I refer to to civil law the same way as Kevin did in
everyday conversation, as do most lawyers.)
But more correctly...
Civil law: Corpus Iurus Civilis 535 CE Justinian (Roman Law - very few
sovereigns, Scotland, I think...); history, statutory interpretation; stone
tablets - 10 Commandments (broad principles anticipate all situations);
Common law: 11th Century England; fact patterns; stare decisis; flexibility;
change-with-the-times; go-with-the-flow.
Jim seems to see/k a pure civil law tradition in the US. If we were in a
*totally pure* civil tradition, his questions would be on the mark. However,
we have a common law legal tradition - even in regard to constitutional
interpretation. Choate advocates a pure civilist legal tradition with THE
CONSTITUTION as the fount. Maybe so does Scalia, but just in regard to the
US Const:
For Choate to even sense the question(s), to get so near it/them...

government agents surreptitiously to be recording their prayers, they also
were aware that the service was being conducted in an outdoor setting. Kee

Below is a good case clip on vid. I disagree with the court's opinion in
this instance, but I can't disagree with the risks in covert entry:
"...Followed to its logical conclusion, the dissent would encourage drug
manufacturers to mount hidden video cameras in their facilities so they can
capture the moment of truth when the police execute a search warrant and
would authorize drug dealers secretly to tape record conversations with
suspected undercover officers or with informants in order to protect the
dealers' rights against hypothetical police abuse. Numerous other examples
exist. The point is an obvious one. Every police encounter would be
available for secret recording..."

is subject to custodial interrogation."(4)  The government does not dispute
that Green was in custody when he
identified the briefcase and safe and unlocked the combination locks on
each, after having been transported by ATF agents to his residence and led
around in the execution of the search
warrant.(5)  The government also does not dispute, although it does not
explicitly concede the point, that the ATF agents' actions in taking Green
to his residence and telling him to assist the agents in executing the
search warrant and show them any firearms in the residence was interrogation
likely to elicit an incriminating response.(6)  Green's actions in
disclosing that
there were firearms in the residence, showing the agents where the firearms
were located, and opening the briefcase and safe were all made in response
to queries from ATF agents after he
had invoked his right to counsel.  This was custodial interrogation.
On appeal, the government mentions its argument made before the district
court that, although Green's oral statements may have been elicited during
custodial interrogation in violation
of his Fifth Amendment right to counsel, Green's acts of opening the
combination locks were non-testimonial.  This argument is without merit.
Supreme Court precedent forecloses any argument
that Green's directing the agents to the two cases containing firearms and
opening the combination locks were not testimonial acts.
In Doe v. United States,(9) the majority implicitly held that this precise
behavior was testimonial communication so expressing the defendant's mind as
to constitute compelled self-incriminatory  statements.(10) There is no
serious question but that Green's actions in disclosing the locations and
opening the combination locks of the cases containing firearms were
testimonial and communicative in nature.(11)  These compelled acts disclosed
Green's knowledge of the presence of firearms in these cases and of the
means of opening these cases.(12)  The ATF agents elicited these testimonial
acts in violation of Green's Fifth Amendment right to counsel, and their
admission at trial was reversible error.

If you can, pick up a copy of Eavesdropping On Trial, '74. It's an
insightful and easy read with good historical footnotes. It's an odd book,
in that it has gained in relevancy through the years. Originally, Congress
was predisposed to outlaw electronic surveillance altogether. Law
enforcement fought for decades to get it. Then, we came up with organized
crime (some still say they "invented" it). Title III was part of the "law
and order" agenda, before we characterized things as "war on." It's
effectiveness in regard to organized crime was even questioned, as that was
the stated target of Title III. It was the time of COINTELPRO, to give you
an idea of the political climate.
Most of the questions raised in '74 (soon after the act's '68 passage and
state implementation), remain unanswered. This suggests that the Title III
scheme itself is flawed.
The forward by Sen. Sam J. Ervin, Jr. is worth a frame:
''The history of American liberty has been a continuing struggle between the
desire for security and the human striving for personal freedom. Too often
it appears that the choice is easy -- for example, that the issue of law and
order is one of balancing the rights of society against the rights of
criminals. But the choice is never as easy as that deceptive formulation
suggests.  The great challenge of our constitutional system is the
continuing reconciliation of these two strong competing interests. Without
law there can be no true liberty, but a constant and exclusive preoccupation
with security is the death of human liberty. This was recognized by American
patriots as long ago as 1775: "Those who would give up essential Liberty, to
purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety."
The citizen who truly honors liberty knows that there are no easy choices.
The public leader who is true to his obligation to inform and educate the
citizenry recognizes that he must shun emotional appeals. It is a great
disservice to the public to succumb to the temptation to make issues of
crime and liberty a political football. Unfortunately, politicians forever
fall victim to the temptation, especially in recent years.
...These issues are too important to be left to the "expert" -- be he
a lawyer, legislator, judge, or prosecutor. While the issues are complex,
this is no arcane subject which the private citizen can safely leave to
others. Few people are neutral about issues such as eavesdropping, but the
public is not well served by rhetoric. As difficult as it may be to address
the subject fairly, openly, and accurately, to do so is necessary if the
public is to be well served.

94th Cong. 1st Sess.
H.R. 1603
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
January 17, 1975
Mr. Drinan introduced the following bill; which was referred the Committee
on the Judiciary.
A BILL
To amend certain sections (authorizing wiretapping and electronic
surveillance) of title 18 of the United States Code.
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled,
That the Congress finds and declares that--
(1)	Widespread wiretapping and electronic surveillance, both by private
persons and Government agents, both under color of law, and without pretense
of legal excuse or justification, has seriously undermined personal security
and often violated fundamental constitutional rights, including the rights
to free speech, press, and association, the rights to due process and equal
protection, and the right to privacy.
(2)	Complexities and defects in current Federal law have aided those who
engage in wiretapping and electronic surveillance, and current Federal law
has not provided adequate safeguards against corrupt abuses of
communications technology.
(3)	No person, in any branch of the Federal Government, in however high an
office, or in any other governmental or private position should be
authorized either explicitly or implicitly to violate the constitutional
rights of persons by eavesdropping on private conversations through
wiretapping and electronic surveillance.
(4)	The end of prosecuting those who violate the law does not justify
wrongdoing on the part of the Government.
(5)	The peculiar susceptibility of wiretapping and electronic surveillance
to misuse in the furtherance of partisan political goals renders wiretapping
and electronic surveillance a particularly dangerous temptation to
Government officials, and the chance of its misuse outweighs any potential
benefits which might otherwise be found in it.
(6)	SEC. 2. Title 18 of the United States Code is amended
(1)	by striking out section 2511(1) Except as otherwise specifically
provided in this chapter any person who and inserting in lieu thereof
(2)	by inserting immediately after subparagraph (d) of section 2511(1), but
before shall be fined the following new subparagraph: (e) willfully
intercepts or records any wire or oral communication without the consent of
all the parties to such communication;
(3)	by striking out or at the end of section 2511(1)(d), and by inserting
or at the end of section 2511(1)(d);
(4)	by striking out sections 2511(2)(a)(ii), (b), (c), and (d);
(5)	by striking out section 2511 (3);
(6)	by striking out section 2512(1) Except as otherwise provided in this
chapter, any person who willfully and inserting in lieu thereof Whoever
(7)	by striking out section 2512(2); and
(8)	by striking out sections 2516, 2517, 2518, 2519, 2510 (9).
"Freedom From Surveillance Act of 1975,"
The gist:
"(a) Except as provided in subjections (b) of this section or otherwise
required by statute, whoever being a civil officer of the United States
willfully conducts investigations into, maintains surveillance over, or
maintains records regarding the beliefs, associations, political activities,
or private affairs of any citizen of the United States, or regarding the
beliefs, membership, or political activities of any group or organization of
such citizens, shall be fined not more than $10,000, or imprisoned not more
than one year, or both."
"(b) Nothing contained in the provisions of this section shall be deemed
either to limit or to enlarge such legal authority of the United States as
may exist to:
"(1) collect, receive, or maintain information relevant to an individual who
has committed or is suspected on reasonable grounds to have committed a

"In the heyday of the Red Squad, law enforcers from J. Edgar Hoover's FBI on
down to the local level in Chicago focused to an unhealthy degree on
political dissidents, whose primary activity was advocacy though it
sometimes spilled over into violence. Today the concern, prudent and not
paranoid, is with ideologically motivated terrorism. The City does not want
to resurrect the Red Squad. It wants to be able to keep tabs on incipient
terrorist groups. New groups of political extremists, believers in and
advocates of violence, form daily around the world. If one forms in or
migrates to Chicago, the decree renders the police helpless to do anything
to protect the public against the day when the group decides to commit a
terrorist act. Until the group goes beyond the advocacy of violence and
begins preparatory actions that might create reasonable suspicion of
imminent criminal activity, the hands of the police are tied. And if the
police have been forbidden to investigate until then, if the investigation
cannot begin until the group is well on its way toward the commission of
terrorist acts, the investigation may come too late to prevent the acts or
to identify the perpetrators. If police get wind that a group of people have
begun meeting and discussing the desirability of committing acts of violence
in pursuit of an ideological agenda, a due regard for the public safety
counsels allowing the police department to monitor the statements of the
group's members, to build a file, perhaps to plant an undercover agent." --

Had they looked into motivations and societal factors, we would have had
more lead time to deal with improper surveillance and secondary use issues.
We are in this position today because they were "wuss-ninnies."

It's technical, but it is a HUMINT solution. Such a solution could be used
not only for intelligence collection, but also for intervention. Another
prime example is in regard to "cyberterrorism," where companies have shown
great reluctance to share information with the government.
They are complaining about a lack of human intelligence, and the difficulty
of penetration. There are strong arguments that crypto can assist the

obstacles to intelligence collection and analysis. (And, as many here have

@_subject: Roving surveillance & misc. 
"Citizen Q" posted a news clip, which included:
A requirement under Title I of the ECPA is that the site of the targeted
phone be identified. This is the statutory embodiment of the forth amendment
particularization requirement. In the case of an "oral conversation,"
[within the meaning of the ECPA] Section 2518(11) eliminates the requirement
when there is a finding by a judge reviewing the application that the site
identification requirement is "impracticable." In contrast, for a "wire or
electronic communication," there must be a finding that the purpose of the
person who is the subject of surveillance is "to thwart interception by
changing facilities."
[1] Although somewhat dated, see Michael Goldsmith, Eavesdropping Reform:
The Legality of Roving Surveillance, 1987 U.Ill. L. Rev. 401 (1987).
[2] The MINIMIZATION REQUIREMENT is found in 2518(5) of the ECPA ("Title
III") requires interception be "conducted in such a way as to minimize the
interception of communications not otherwise subject to interception," in
order to prevent a fourth amendment prohibited "general search." For the
search of a conversation to be reasonable, minimization must take place so
that the government does not seize conversations unrelated to criminal
But see, SCOTT V. UNITED STATES, 436 U.S. 128 (1978) (court rejected the
view that 2518(5) required officers to engage in good faith efforts to
minimize the surveillance of non-pertinent conversations). "Scott factors"
as delineated in later decisions, have been the subject of considerable
criticism. Some states have rejected it entirely, requiring good faith at
the outset under state statutes. (Biometric and technological minimization
might provide a partial answer to Scott's latitude. If plausible, the Scott
doctrine should be tightened in the statute to require sincere "good faith"
minimization in light of any new technological aids to minimization.)
[3] TESTIMONY OF JAMES P. FLEISSNER ON THE COMPREHENSIVE ANTITERRORISM ACT
OF 1995... @ (discussing roving surveillance and supporting the harmonization of the two
roving surveillance provisions, and discussing the crimes already in the
statute with ties to terrorism).
[4] NOTICE. The notice and inventory provisions of the ECPA need to be
amended to provide notice to non-targets. 2518(8)(d) entitles only those
persons who were named in the court order (suspected of criminal activity)
to receive notice and inventory. The statutory provisions, which were
supposed to provide oversight, have been rendered meaningless by the courts.
There is a discretionary provision allowing a judge to notify a non-target
individual if, in his/her opinion, circumstances call for it.
[5] THE NATURE OF JUDICIAL OVERSIGHT. In regard to the Pen Register and Trap
and Trace Device provisions, the complaint is the lack of judicial
oversight. ["Upon an application made under section 3122(a)(1) of this
title, the court *shall* enter an ex parte order authorizing the
installation and use of a pen register or trap and trace device if the court
finds that the attorney for the Government has certified to the court that
the information likely to be obtained by such installation and use is
relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation."] Communication data, or
communication attributes, have already been the subject of considerable
controversy. Some argue that in contrast to judicial and legislative
interpretation, communication attributes are deserving of GREATER
constitutional protection -- not less, pointing to the fact that
communication data is more precise and revealing.
[6] See also, _Terrorism & The Constitution-Sacrificing Civil Liberties in
the Name of National Security_ by James X. Dempsey & David Cole -- available
on Amazon.
"But when, under conditions of modern warfare, our shores are threatened by
hostile forces, the power to protect must be commensurate with the
threatened danger." Korematsu v. United States, 323 U.S. 214, 220 (1944)

The conversation elsewhere is out of control...even "negative recognition"
in addition to a National Biometric-ID. The fear is that its an "appearance
measure." My response on another list was fairly long-winded, but it did
include the following:
(1) The pretexter. Mr. Terrorist -- he's a suspect or (hopes to be) a
fugitive, or he wouldn't be pretexting an ID.
(2) The patsy. Ann Murphy -- married and pregnant when her new husband tried
to put her on a plane with 3 pounds of plastic explosive. She was recruited
and set up over a year.
(3) The inward spy. Colonel von Stauffenberg -- admitted to Hitler's Wolf
Lair without question.
(4) The priest. Father Terrorist -- he is who he is. The only thing he has
to hide is his intent.
In 2, 3, and 4 authentication is an exploit. If it leads to a false sense of
security, it is an exploit. ''They'' will go for timing + circumstance +
opportunity. (The focus has shifted away from airplanes.) Myself and several
others have pointed out how this would agitate domestic dissident groups,
further civil tension, and possibly provoke violence -- the terrorist
objective straight out of "TERRORISM 101."
I just haven't seen any compelling counter-terrorism studies FOCUSING on
this (I'm looking, and I'm sure that I will...). Although document forgery
is an immigration problem, it sounds like one that can be addressed at the
border. While authentication is a first line defense, I question this
measure in terms of "combating terrorism," and worry that it is over-rated.
It's also something that goes with chokepoint-checkpoints.

Under the California statute, a conversation in which the parties have no
expectation that the discussion would not be disclosed to others is not
confidential. Cal. Penal Code. Sect.632(a). "Confidentiality" has been
construed in California to mean "a reasonable expectation that the content
of the communication has been entrusted privately to the listener." Deteresa
v. American Braodcasting Co. 121 F.3d 460, 464 (9th Cir. 1997, cert. denied,
118 S. Ct. 1840 (1998).
Oral Communication under Title I (of "Title III" or the ECPA) incorporates
the Katz test. The Katz test is two-pronged: (1) the person challenging must
exhibit an expectation of privacy [subjective] and (2) that person must also
be justified in that expectation [objective]. If both prongs are not met,
the conversation is not protected under the constitution against warrantless
Senate Report 1097: neither the speakers intention to talk in confidence nor
the location of where the conversation happened controls the determination
of whether or not he reasonably expected he could not or would not be
overheard. The factors that might be considered in regard to the first prong
are: precautions taken, content, purpose, etc. Therefore, words a person
knowingly "puts to the public," possibly even in your home, can be outside
of the Fourth Amendment and Title III. However, it's a very contextual
Often, the courts use the rationale that because you have no reason to
believe your conversation is not being overheard, you have no reason to
believe you are not being recorded. See In re Johen Doe Trader No. One, 894
F.2d 240, 243 (7th Cir. 1990)(recording on floor of commodities exchange).
They could also make the analogy to a visitor of a bugged house, such as
United States v. Flemmi, 225 F.3d 78 (1st Cir. 2000). However, the mere fact
that the conversation is on government premises does not affect an
expectation of privacy. United States v. Jackson, 588 F.2d 1046, 1052 (5th
Cir. 1979)....and a bunch more after that.

@_subject: Extraterritorial surveillance. 
Electronic surveillance occurring outside the territorial U.S. is not
regulated by Title III or state surveillance statutes. The Fourth Amendment
is implicated if American officers are the instigators. If there is U.S.
involvement, the Fourth will be violated if the surveillance violated the
law of the foreign jurisdiction. [1]
The catch, as always, is the suppression remedy. (Note that Congress did not
give a suppression remedy for electronic communications.) With regard to
foreign surveillance, the justification has been that suppression does not
serve a deterrent to foreign actors. (What they fail to consider, is that
this cooperation is prone to abuse, especially in regard to economic
espionage. Foreign intelligence agencies service their own agendas, and
these agendas are increasingly tied to private interests. It's a legitimacy
blanket for blackmail, source recruitment, infiltration and so on....) If
the U.S. liaisons acted in good faith reliance as to the foreign operation,
they are entitled to the good faith exception. If it's a silver plate
service, without involvement, you can use in it prosecution. [2] The general
rule is that it has to "shock" the judicial conscience to be excluded, or
"Taunt Happy-Fun Court" in cypherpunk lingo.
For domestic group surveillance related to national security interests, see
United Sates v. United States District Court, 407 U.S. 297 (1972),
[construing 2511(3)in 1972; pre-FISA] (Title III did not reach national
security surveillance, and the President could not conduct warrantless
surveillance against exclusively domestic organizations). The same arguments
are being made today.
Surveillance law in the United States is the study of the backbone of the
judiciary, bent by the ignorance of congress, due to the machinations of the
executive branch.

the proposed Section 105 Use of Wiretap Information From Foreign
Governments: "Under current case law, federal prosecutors appear to have the
ability to use electronic surveillance conducted by foreign governments in
criminal proceedings. As criminal law enforcement becomes more of a global
effort, such information will come to play a larger role in federal
prosecutions. To ensure uniformity of federal practice, this section
codifies the principle that United States prosecutors may use against
American citizens information collected by a foreign government even if the
collection would have violated the Fourth Amendment. Under the proposal,
such information may not be used if it was obtained with the knowing
participation" or at the direction of American law enforcement personnel,
if gathered in violation of constitutional protections."

Solutions that provoke acts of domestic terrorism, rather than preventing

used some responsive commentary in here to make this point elsewhere.)
In my opinion, some of these proposals not only "trade security for
privacy," (their words) they are going to "trade privacy for terrorism." I
think that's a bad deal for everybody.
Part of our problem in regard to U.S.-based domestic terrorism and militia
groups has been our prosecutorial or military "snatch" mindset. We need to
attack their strategy, rather than engage in actions that legitimize their
world views, incite action, encourage radicalization and facilitate
This is a WAR On Terrorism -- not a Keystone Cop chase. I believe that any
responsible analysis of proposed solutions should squarely address the issue
of domestic incitement. Polls with CitizenQ-like opinions express American

not pause to examine the implications.
Would it be ironic if, in our efforts to "stop" the unthinkable, we give

It wasn't "fantasy gibberish," my comments were intended as humorous,
tongue-in-cheek response to repeated attempts of individuals seeking to
ferret me out as an "FBI Agent." Jeesh.
Oh, please....

Sorry for FINALLY getting a little testy in regard to the Aimee-agent
theory. I didn't mean to give offense, sincerely. (I had just received a
rather concerning message offlist.) My comments would have been more
appropriately directed to that person, but they did not leave a

Spirit of ignorance. Somebody FWD'd a quip from Tim May, posted to another
list, referring to an "Agent Farr," connected with hypothetical terroristic
acts. I am only a victim of May's master polemics.
I'm going to disappoint you.

"aggravated" Tim. In retrospect, it was most unwise. I should try to stay
out of his radar.
No, I didn't. I have many admirers.
I'm flattered my head was worth $4.

Reminds me, book of situational interest:
American Political Prisoners: Prosecutions [Under the Espionage and Sedition
By Stephen M. Kohn (Praeger, 1994, ISBN: 0-275-94415-8, 240 pages).
The gist: The book is the product of FOIA requests (and a successful
lawsuit), consisting of official correspondence, letters from prisoners,
photos, etc. of people "not thinking correctly." The prisoners in the book
ran a gamut from labor, anarchists, pacifists, etc. Conditions of
confinement were so poor, that some died before trial, others went insane,
or become infected with TB in prison. Many of them simply circulated written
material. Statements such as "gone crazy over patriotism," "We need
preparedness, not to kill one another, but to live peaceably, happily and
equally," and "war is organized murder," effectively netted people
torturous, abusive conditions. We convicted several preachers for preaching
"do not kill," others for criticizing war bonds, many for membership in the
IWW, and a substantial number of people based on no evidence whatsoever.
(WWI was trench warfare. The military had not yet mastered combat
discipline.) In the eyes of many, patriotism was used as a weapon to quash a
movement (organized labor) seen as a threat to our power structure. It put
an ugly, human perspective on what I otherwise knew as just a few cases and
The laws are still on the books. (Our sabotage and espionage laws do need
I was struck by how some called themselves "internationalists." Our national
security outlook predicts the rise of NGOs and networks based on subnational
identifiers, which will be the cause of subversion and insurrection on a
global scale. It doesn't sound too much unlike the "internationalists," does
The reaction in other countries will no doubt be more extreme.
(I don't envy our people that have to make foreign faction-calls in the
coming environment, it's like sticking your head in a guillotine.)

Yes, it takes two, and I admit my role in it. Let's just drop it, nobody
wants to hear this banter.
