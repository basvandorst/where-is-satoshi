@_subject: Movie about aaron swartz can use some funding on kickstarter 
References:  Link to Trailer: Hope you are well! Been a long time :-)
I'm making movies to teach the world more about Aaron Swartz and to help
the public better understand whistleblowers and whistleblower upload
I wanted to let you know about my little Kickstarter campaign for a movie I
am producing independently, "From DeadDrop to SecureDrop" - it's about
"SecureDrop," an anonymous upload system for whistleblowers that Aaron
prototyped with Kevin Poulsen, one month before his death, that connects
directly to news organizations (such as the Washington Post, Forbes, and
The New Yorker):
Here's a Tweet about it, if you're short on time:
Please help fund "From DeadDrop to SecureDrop" and help more potential
Whistleblowers learn about  I'm including a description of the project below! It's only going on for 4
more days, and I only have about $5,000 of the $20,000 I'm trying to raise,
so any help -- or also Tweets and social media love would be greatly
Thanks! :)
Much love,
The film is entitled "From DeadDrop to SecureDrop," and provides a
historical account of how the "SecureDrop" open source anonymous
whistleblowing submission platform was originally prototyped by Kevin
Poulsen and Aaron Swartz, and later, after Aaron's death, how it made its
way its current home at the Freedom of the Press Foundation.
People in the film (so far) include: Wired's Kevin Poulsen (how he was
inspired by WikiLeaks and then convinced Aaron to work with him on the
project), Trevor Timm and John Perry Barlow (of the Freedom of the Press
Foundation), who sought out the DeadDrop prototype, Garrett Robinson
(SecureDrop's current Development Lead) and Bill Budington (an EFF engineer
who worked directly on the early codebase), and some influential figures
familiar with the issues, such as Brewster Kahle (Founder of the Internet
Archive and co-founder, with myself, of Aaron Swartz Day) and Cindy Cohn
(Executive Director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation). I also
interviewed Virgil Griffith (Tor2Web and Wikiscanner), as he and Aaron were
good friends and worked on Tor2Web together.
Jacob Applebaum has agreed to be interviewed for the film. (Besides being a
WikiLeaks volunteer, he was good friends with Aaron.) Also, Sarah Harrison,
who stood by Edward Snowden's side in Hong Kong and the Moscow airport, and
assisted with getting him safe asylum in Russia, has agreed to be in the
After learning more about whistleblower Chelsea Manning (in the course of
my preparing to read her statement during my live Aaron Swartz Day event)
video:  statement:
I came to realize that the film really needs to expand beyond the subject
of the SecureDrop technology itself, to attempt to explain *why* these
whistleblowers might decide to use WikiLeaks or SecureDrop to expose
corruption in the first place: To inform the public and make the world a
better place. I realize this sounds simple and obvious, but I don't think
that most people are actually aware of this. Here's a post explaining how
Ed Snowden chose the Constitution over a Non-Disclosure agreement, when he
decided to blow the whistle: A third theme of the movie deals directly with an observation made by more
than one of the people I interviewed for the film, about how SecureDrop
will "help the next Ed Snowden" communicate with Journalists safely (so no
one will have to go through what he went through, just to get a story out).
The film suggests that SecureDrop could potentially usher in a new
generation of whistleblower: One that won't necessarily have to put their
whole life at risk, in order to "do the right thing."

Juan dear,
Instead arguing with you about vocabulary, real meaning of some words or
not, limits of some concepts, gender equality, men and women, storks and
babies, I decided asking for help and avoid a possible gaffe or being
unfair with you.  :P
I was thinking about asking you some suggestions of good anarchist
readings, because I made some searches and  - wow! -  the bibliography is
really huge.  I need some help to separate the wheat from the shaft,
please.  Or a guide "Advanced Anarchism for Dummies".  I know only the baby
steps, sorry.  :(
I asked Steve some suggestions in private, but it's better to ask publicly,
so more people can profit the clues.  Oh, you know, he loves books, uses
cute emoticons and makes oink oink.  He's a good reference for me,

Hi Cari!  Hi Bastiani!  :D
Thank you very much for the kind suggestions!  <3
I was writing an answer to Juan, talking about 'sexism' and feminism, but
decided to search about the relations about anarchism, feminism and also
sexism.  I've found several references and different concepts, some of them
a bit confuse and contraditory.
So, it would be unfair to say Juan was wrong.  Some writers think he's
right, but some anarcha-feminists say the 'sexism' really exists and use
this exact word in their texts.  :P
After some reading, I thought it would be more logical to understand the
anarchism decently, before analyzing its relations with feminism and,
maybe, with 'sexism'.  Mental masturbation takes additional time, but is
always fun, hihi!  :)
I've found different definitions of 'sexism' on internet and, being
sincere, I thought some of them are so 'sexist' as the prejudice that they
want to avoid.  There are some good, reasonable definitions, but most of
them were very frustrating.  Meh!  Better to study a bit more and have my
own personal beliefs.  :P
Lots of thankful little kisses, muuaaah!!!  :*

I suggest to watch "Grave of the Fireflies", if someone wish to pay tribute
to Hiroshima in a different way.
It's beautiful and sensible, but also one of the saddest 'anime'  (Japanese
animated movies/series)  that I saw in my whole life.
Not for being Japanese, not for showing the Second World War, but because
it shows the point of view of  children.  Children starving, crying, losing
their parents and dying without ever understanding the war.
In all the wars, what always worries me the most are the children, their
traums.  They don't have any guilt and always suffer all the pain.
Sorry, I didn't find the animated movie with English subtitles on line,
just the trailer.  It's the kind of story so disturbing, so intensely sad
that you can watch only once in your life.  I, probably, was not brave
enough in my searches, pardon.

References: All the times when I read River, I remember it's a pseudonym very used in
sites of sex stories about BDSM or to contact eventual sexual partners.
The same about Rain, Forest and other nicknames like these.  I don't know
if it was just a coincidence, a bad joke or if it is their nature, their
sexual preference.
Well, usually, a vanilla person would not choose this kind of pseudonym,
but I really don't care about their sexual practices.  I just think it's
very fun see chaste, immaculate, innocent vanilla people using hardcore
BDSM nicks.  Really hypocrite, considering that Jake, in some moments, was
judged for his sexuality, not for his character.
I am late with some really important answers, but as I told to a contact
some days later, and repeated to another person today, Jake always
respected me and all my female friends a lot, acting like a real gentleman
and, believe me, some of them are beautiful women and tried to flirt with
him hardly.  :P
He was a very handsome, charismatic, sexy, famous, intelligent man, walking
among lots of all kinds of activists, men and women, in several events
around the whole world.  Very glamorous.  Becoming one of his lovers or
girlfriends was a way of increasing social status, so he really refused a
lot of crazy invasive people to avoid problems and being related to these
people.  He could have sex very easily, in all the places and parties,
without "raping" someone.
I saw it happening in person.  He was very professional and gentle,
refusing more intimate contacts in a polite and discreet way.  He rejected
one of my personal friends in a Brazilian event and she is a young
intelligent woman, much more beautiful and interesting than me.  It is
strange for a 'serial rapist', a crazy psychopath, isn't it?  :-/
Well, let's wait to discover what will happen.  There are lots of things
that simply don't make sense in all this drama.  It would not be rational
or reasonable.
Kisses and hugs for all of you!  :*  <3
PS:  -  Ah, a silly curiosity!  One of "Rivers" liked a lot to write about
incest and bestiality, hardcore taboo themes in general, but I really liked
her writing style, so I tried to contact her to ask about the choice of her
I never received an answer, but it was an interesting experience.  I think
this River in special is a girl, not a guy, and she is very intelligent.
Their stories are very disturbing  -  too 'eeck!!!' for my taste, ugh!  -,
but are intelligent and she got some archetypical desires, with subtle
references to Greek legends.  She is not a stupid girl trying to get
audience.  (Different of the j.a. group members' initial pattern, haha!!)
Well, sex with animals is not vegan, but all the people are animals and I
suppose her "lovers", if really exist, receive a good treatment.  ;)

Being vegan is very fun for lighthearted trolls.  I can use it as excuse
for everything and always will be people thinking I am talking seriously.
Currently, I am saying to some friends that hunting pokémons is not vegan
at all, hahaha!!  ;D
Personally I don't hold much hope for humanity..I figure the solution to
Fermis paradox is self-evident. We are going to fucking destroy ourselves.
Live it up while you can ;)
While the end doesn't arrive, I was reading a bit about Victoria Woodhull
[1] and cute soldering kits.  I really appreciated to learn a bit more
about her.  Great girl, wow!  :D
Yep, thinking about the future can be very depressing, but it's fun to
think about all the possibilities.  I really think technology and goodwill
can make a better world for everybody and  - wow! -  there are lots of
interesting, amazing people in the whole world.
Being alive is still fun, even when everything makes no sense.  Life is
very crazy in some moments.
Now, I was trying to mention a Hardy Har Har quote to make you laugh and
discovered the eternal pessimist hyena is more bitter and depressive in the
Brazilian version, haha!!  ;D
It's funnier, much more dramatic, but was strange to discover how much the
translations can adapt or modify the original talks.  Here the hyena always
complains "I know it won't work...  Oh Heavens!  Oh day!  Oh bad luck!"
instead "Oh me, oh my, oh dear"...   :P
This kind of unexpected fun thing keeps me alive and my mood, more or less,
good.  You know, life is a bitch and sucks, but, in some moments, it is
very expensive, dramatic and doesn't suck well.  ;)
In any case, there are lots of good people and wonderful music in the
world.  And children.  Children always are the hope for a better future!  <3
Tender kisses, warm hugs and lots of hope!  :*

Jake always considered himself a queer, bisexual man.  It was part of his
"problems" when he was publicly judged for his sexuality.  A lot of
moralist, hypocrite people judging his gender, his sexual preferences, not
his character, his real acts.
I've "lost" a "friend", because she said "Jake certainly raped these
people, once he was promiscuous enough to have sexual intercourses with
both genders".
So much prejudice, aff...  Very disgusting.  Judge a person for their
gender and for their sexuality is very stupid.

gender and for their sexuality is very stupid.
that the community has a double standard. That people like Jake who act
male (even if they're gay or bisexual) get lynched. But people who are just
as promiscuous, but act female or androgynous, get a pass. They get to be
I got your point, my love, but I do try to refuse this kind of social
condescension, all these labels.  I am not weaker for being a woman.  I am
not a victim.  And yes, I think it's very disgusting when a person uses
their gender to get benefits.  And yes again, it was very depressing,
really unfair and nocive to see how some people managed their labels
against a "white North American man", being he really guilty or not.  :((
This kind of fake situation creates more prejudice, and more stupid labels,
and more and more social judgements.  The real victims of rape, of all
kinds of brutality and harassment, will lose their credibility, because of
stupid fucking liars and it's sad, unfair, wrong and very, very hurtful for
real victims!  :((
In the other side, I already told you I have transgender friends and make
volunteer work in LGBTQ groups, my love.  There are much hate and
intolerance against them.  It's really hard.
There is so much prejudice against them that it's really hard to discover
the limits between true prejudice or not.  Even working with them, in some
moments, involuntarily, I make horrible gaffes.  :(
Once, I was explaining that a female trans friend was born a man and was
waiting for her hormonal treatment and another trans friend said it was
very offensive for everybody, because my friend always was a woman, since
her birth.  She was not born a man.  I was talking about chromosomes,
genetics only, but I hurt a friend involuntarily.  :(((
Do you understand how hard is having sensibility enough to avoid hurting
fragile people, my love?  So, be careful, please.  Love you!  :*

Come you masters of war
You that build all the guns
You that build the death planes
You that build all the bombs
You that hide behind walls
You that hide behind desks
I just want you to know
I can see through your masks.
You that never done nothin'
But build to destroy
You play with my world
Like it's your little toy
You put a gun in my hand
And you hide from my eyes
And you turn and run farther
When the fast bullets fly.
Like Judas of old
You lie and deceive
A world war can be won
You want me to believe
But I see through your eyes
And I see through your brain
Like I see through the water
That runs down my drain.
You fasten all the triggers
For the others to fire
Then you set back and watch
When the death count gets higher
You hide in your mansion'
As young people's blood
Flows out of their bodies
And is buried in the mud.
You've thrown the worst fear
That can ever be hurled
Fear to bring children
Into the world
For threatening my baby
Unborn and unnamed
You ain't worth the blood
That runs in your veins.
How much do I know
To talk out of turn
You might say that I'm young
You might say I'm unlearned
But there's one thing I know
Though I'm younger than you
That even Jesus would never
Forgive what you do.
Let me ask you one question
Is your money that good
Will it buy you forgiveness
Do you think that it could
I think you will find
When your death takes its toll
All the money you made
Will never buy back your soul.
And I hope that you die
And your death'll come soon
I will follow your casket
In the pale afternoon
And I'll watch while you're lowered
Down to your deathbed
And I'll stand over your grave
'Til I'm sure that you're dead.

---------- Forwarded message ----------
Hi all,
We are pleased to accounce that Tor Browser 6.0.4 is ready for testing.
Bundles can be found on:
This release finally brings Tor Browser users the latest Tor stable,
0.2.8.6, and avoids pinging Mozilla servers for system extensions.
The latter was responsible for users getting an extension into their Tor
Browser that resulted in annoying and confusing "Your Firefox is out of
date" notifications on start-up (bug 19890). Thanks to Mozilla engineers
who fixed that issue as fast as possible on their side: the extension is
not shipped to Tor Browser users anymore if they ping Mozilla's server.
Users that are on the alpha channel or are using the hardened Tor
Browser were not affected. The same goes for Tails users as far as we know.
The full changelog since Tor Browser 6.0.3 is:
Tor Browser 6.0.4 -- August 16
 * All Platforms
   * Update Tor to 0.2.8.6
   * Update NoScript to 2.9.0.14
   * Bug 19890: Disable installation of system addons

Definitely, without any doubt, I am the world's worst programmer, but this
kind of thing is pure love, ow!  *-*
I love esoteric programming languages and "hello world" using ArnoldC is
pretty cute!  I didn't know this language!  <3
But this is my favorite language, the only one that makes me feel like a
great ninja programmer, yay!!!  :D
Unnecessary is an esoteric programming language. The language is named
'Unnecessary' because of the method this programming language works: the
source file is unnecessary; in fact the existence of source code file leads
to critical error. In case of critical error the interpreter must stop
immediately and report the error.
Unnecessary has no instructions/commands. You can do nothing with this
language, so using it is unnecessary as well. The whole Unnecessary program
is NOP. Or actually, there should be no Unnecessary programs, since only
valid Unnecessary program is a non-existing source code file.
The goal was to create a programming language that is easy to learn, not
very useful, doesn't require input or do output, has no memory, has no
instructions. Only an interpreter is required. As well, good thing is that
distributing Unnecessary programs is extremely easy, and can be done
without computers. As well, storage is no problem: you can have infinite
amount of Unnecessary programs in a memory bit. Actually, storing them
requires less memory than a bit.
Every valid program, however, is a quine. That's the only possible program,
and the only valid form of program. In Unnecessary creating a null quine
doesn't even require the existence of the empty program file, as in other
languages. Has programming ever been easier?(Not to mention that it isn't
even possible to write anything else than bug-free code!)
Oh, and the valid Unnecessary program file extension is "unn".

Zenaan, my dear, your country serves Vegemite to children.  It's a pretty
serious crime against humanity and it occurs daily, in all Australian
It has lots of sodium, a disgusting flavour and stinks more than my
disastrous homemade Sauerkraut.  Am I saying "Hail Australia", Land of
Vegemite and Home of Crocodilo Dundee?  :-)
This crime was horrible, really shocking and sad, but the point is
recognizing publicly the existence of a repulsive crime and never more
permiss that something similar occurs in the whole world, not just
criticizing a country.  Sorry, it doesn't make sense.
I do love my country, but it never will be a blind stupid love.  There are
lots of disgusting crimes here and also in your country, in the USA, in
Russia, in the whole world.  No exceptions.
The USA are not my favorite country, but it was not a regional problem.
Violent crimes happen in every single country of this world, including
Russia.  Please, remember it.
Ah, for your knowledge, I hate all the governments, including Russian.  No
exceptions here too.  As Mirimir, I love Russian people, but it is too much
innocence believing that Russian government is better than North-American
government.  Both are disgusting.

Nothing really important.  I was just saying that you should not consider
_only_ US military origins to judge if something is good or not.  You can,
but should not do it.
I was also telling Mirimir that I don't like weapons.  Had bad experiences

USA killed great part of my dad's family.  They used nuclear weapons to
destroy lifes and cities.  Japan was already deeply destroied when they
decided to test their nuclear bombs.  My dad's family used to live in
Hiroshima.  You know what happened with them.
My mom always says it was racism, that US probably would use the bombs in
some oriental country or in Africa anyway, because oriental people and
black people are always considered inferior people there.  They are not
Caucasian, they are different physically, they have different ways of
being, beliefs, religions, food, etc.
Well, the problem is not North American prejudice, but all the prejudices.
All the people have difficulties to understand, to accept and to respect
differences, to manage their personal references.
USA and Germany used the war as an excuse to test their new toys playing
with human lifes.  Japan, Italy, England, France, all the other countries
didn't do the same just because they had not 'new toys' or they probably
had played with them in a cruel way too.
The problem was not the country, but all the wars.  There are lots of good
people in all the countries, in all the places.  A country is not a villain
or the good guy, Zenaan.  Russia is not better than USA.  They are
different countries and have different backgrounds.  Both deserves respect.
It would not be rational to hate USA for killing my family.  Lots of people
there also lost their families in that stupid and cruel war.  I need to
hate all the wars,governments, bad people, cruelty and lies, not USA.
(Certainly, mosquitos too.  Maybe also Vegemite.)
Take care, everybody!  Have a lovely weekend and lots of love and fun!  <3

I love countries and their cultures, my dear.  Unhappily, there are
frontiers among all the countries.
list. You saw what kind of garbage the boyces and the quinns posted here.
And you are still making excuses for "the land of the free"?
I admiss I didn't like Boyce, Dani Moth, Quinn and Ted's messages, but I am
not "making excuses" for their country, Juan.
Ted was the most aggressive of all and I think he was talking only about
Zenaan and you, but he seems _a lot_ the kind of guy who shoots in
someone's head saying that some people "deserves" it for being different.
I was really shocked after reading his messages.
Boyce's act of banning was disgusting, but what really upset me was the
"rape apology" stuff.  It was completely unnecessary and pretty sick
knowing my past and details of my present.  But, well, everybody knows his
ego is much bigger than his intelligence.  He is an intelligent guy, but is
very pretentious.  It always was usual inside Tor Project core team.  He
follows their patterns.
In that occasion, I admiss I hoped sincerely that Boyce and Dani Moth were
raped twice each one, because only a person who _really_  was raped can be
completely sure that making "rape apology" always will be impossible for
I love sex.  Rape is not sex, it is violence, fury, torture.  It's dark.
It is to feel a dark and deep fear of death.  Usually, I don't feel fear of
death.  It is the only certainty in this uncertain life.  I swear I felt
the same desperate fear of death when I was raped.
Nobody deserves to feel this kind of despair.  I was angry in that occasion
and I sincerely apologize for wishing something so cruel for Boyce and
Dani.  I regret it a lot and ask pardon for being like them.  It is not
correct at all.
Quinn is intolerant and has narrow patterns of decency, but he is a good
person and I like him, Juan.  You are not exactly tolerant and open-minded
too, haha!!  ;D
Americans who believe the use of nuclear weapons was justified is now 56%,
with 34% saying it was not. "
Sorry, I don't believe in all researches because I have lots of researchers
as friends and colleagues and I was a researcher in several moments of my
life too, my dear Juan.  And you know, I am terribly hard headed like you,
haha!!  ;D
It was a political decision, not military, Juan.  In all the countries, in
all the places, the problem is the government, not the people.
Few stupid and cruel politicians killed my family, not the North American
people.  There are lots of infinitely sad ghosts stories in Hiroshima.
Shadows and eternal crying...  I sincerely hope these sad ghosts haunt all
the cruel politicians who decided to play with human lives.
My migraine is still killing me and my mood is really bad.  I don't like
drugs, but tried a lots of medicines for pain in last days.  My hard head
and I think they didn't work, haha!!  ;D
I bet you will feel envy now, Juan.  Coconut ice cream and sweet corn ice
cream, nom nom...  Trying usual food will be a disaster.  Ice cream is a
good choice when feeling sick.  My mood will be better soon, hihi...  <3
I was thinking about lemon and ginger popsicles, much better for sickness,
but they had only creamy ice creams now.  So, I will make tea.  Hot and
cold together, hihi...  <3
You are a good person, my dear Juan.  I was wrong about Razer and you being
a couple in love.  Now I hope you, Razer and Mirimir can make a lovely
ménage à trois and being happy forever, hahaha!!!  ;D
Nope, I am sick and you are too far to kick my butt like a soccer ball...
and Messi is not playing anymore, hahaha!!  ;D

syversons and his lapdogs.
Juan, my dear, US already have lots of people making excuses for them and
being well paid for it.  Don't worry, I won't waste my time with it.  I
simply told you what I think about countries, governments and people.
The same way there are lots of awesome persons in all the countries, there
are lots of bad persons  ("scumbags"?)  in all the countries too.
(Sorry, I still don't know exactly what "scumbag" means, because there are
several bizarre definitions in Brazilian posts  ("gentalha"?  wtf?),  but
probably there are lots of scumbags in all the places, haha!!)
he is a good person and I like him, Juan.
Well, I am sure Quinn thinks exactly the same thing all the times when I
say I like you in public, my dear Juan...  hihi...  ;)
I never said that I am tolerant and open-minded, Juan.  Sorry if you felt
offended with my words.  I don't support any kind of 'nazis'.  Radical
people are extremely boring.
lots of researchers as friends and colleagues and I was a researcher in
several moments of my life too
Hmm...  Sorry, after talking about deaths, wars and rapes, I confess I was
thinking only in Portuguese.  Always is the most comfortable language for
Pardon, reading now what wrote yesterday, there are more mistakes and I
didn't write some words when talking about the rapes.  Both made me feel
the same way, the same deep panic of death, the same smell of fear.  Sorry
for it.
"Eu não acredito em todas as pesquisas" here doesn't mean necessarily that
I really do _not_ believe in _all_ researches.  If I really wouldn't
believe in all researches, in Portuguese, I would use 'double negative',
what doesn't exist in English, sorry.  I would say "Eu não acredito em
nenhuma pesquisa", Juan.  I simply translated - literally - what I thought
in that moment and doesn't make sense in English, sorry.
I was trying to say that not necessarily I believe in all researches, that
I don't believe in some of them...  Does it sound better now or should I
try again?  :P

Juan, you and Quinn are not my friends, but I appreciate both.  Certainly
not enough to invite you to visit my house or to borrow money and books,

A fool example, I have friends who believe in God in a blind way and also
extremely Atheists friends.  They are good persons and I sincerely respect

character and are intelligent.

the nazis were not that they were radicals. Or that they were 'boring'...
I was not talking about nazism, only about extremely radical people:
feminazis, vegan nazis, econazis, etc.  Sorry, at least for me, radical
people are always boring and/or annoing.
ignore this particular poll because it doesn't paint the americunts in a
good light. But the poll is completely consistent with americunt 'culture'.
If anything the real numbers are prolly higher.
Juan, it hurts me a lot because it is a pool about my family's death, not
because "doesn't paint the americans in a good light".  It would hurt me
the same if it was a pool about French people opinion, if it was a pool
about Chinese people opinion...  The problem is thinking about people
saying that it was correct to use nuclear weapons to kill people.
And, please, always remember that laws, sausages and researches are not

Serotonin and endorphins are science.  I told you I like science.  I was
not offending you.  Search about hormones and their effects in the mood.
If I am a "fucking retard", at least, I have the "fuck¡ng" part and my mood
is better than yours...  Better being a fuck¡ng retard than being a retard
without fuck¡ng like you, hihi!  :)
establishment propaganda. Get a fucking clue. Or stop playing dumb.
If you don't want to read my messages, just delete all of them.  I really
don't care and I still think you needs serotonin and endorphins urgently,
Juan.  Try it, please.

comments I've made here. Same thing for quinn. All we know about him is
that he's a totalitarian american shitbag. Whatever your personal
connection to him is, (if any) it's irrelevant here.
Why are you so sure about it, my dear Juan?  You never will know exactly
what I know, hihi...  Nobody can know _exactly_ what another person knows.
Never forget it, my dear.  :-)
that quinn is a 'good' person too, since we represent completely opposed
views of what 'good' means.
My dear Juan, I am talking about MY subjetive impressions about persons in
general.  Why can't you accept that I don't think exactly what you want I
think?  :(((
Is it so offensive for you if I have my own opinion and it is different
than yours?  Why are you trying to impose me your opinion like a dictator?
Please, you say to be an 'anarchist', so be coherent.  You say I am a
'retard', but I am an honest retard and you are not being honest, if you
really are an anarchist.
I didn't try to impose you my opinion.  I simply told you what I think
about you, and people, and about countries, wars, whatever...  I never said
my words are an 'absolute truth' or that I never will be wrong...
Hey!  Don't you respect a person's beliefs?  Why do you think a religious
person is a liar?  :P
Not necessarily.  Even using Math or Physics, nobody can prove the
existence or not of a God (or Gods, or Godess, or Godesses, whatever).  If
God exists, it is not a lie.
There are several religions and holy books, but there is not an
unambiguous, definitive interpretation of God, Juan.  Sincerely?  I don't
trust religions and holy books, but I tried to study lots and lots of
possibilities when younger.  Reviews?  Always is about love.  Trying to be
a good person and avoiding to be a bad person is enough.
(I am not talking about being a 'saint' or something similar.  Just
avoiding to be a son of a b¡tch is enough and God and/or the people will
sincerely appreciate your efforts!  :-)
I know, infinitely subjetive points of view, different backgrounds and ways
of being, etc, etc...  Part of world's beauty is how different can be the
persons.  Some people explode cities using nuclear weapons, some people try
to build a whole new world...  :-)
Oh, good!  hihi...  :-)
'good' utopian governments that do stuff that you think is 'good', like, I
don't know 'free' schooling for poor children.
You already know what I think about governments.  I don't support them.
making sure...before pointing out that you are in no position to call me
'aggressive' or 'intolerant'.
Only limited and/or stupid people respect labels.  A person is much more
than empty labels.  Persons are their acts, their thoughts, their words,
not the labels they like to use in society.
If you want to use the "anarchist" label, the problem is yours, not mine.
I hate governments, but I really think it is very limited to say "Oh, I am
Instead just talking about being a proud anarchist in lists, mimimi
mimimi, do something real to destroy governments.  "Talking is cheap, show
me the code", do you remember?  I am doing my part instead consider myself
an anarchist.
I only make jokes using 'vegan' and 'veggie' labels to explain that I don't
eat meat and I don't like to kill animals, because the people really have
serious problems to understand my reasons and it is easier to use a stupid
already knowed label than spending time explaining all my actions.  Nobody
seems to care enough to see my acts, they just want to know my labels and
judge them.
Sorry, if I need to say "Oh, Juan, I am anarchist" to be accepted for you,
we never will be friends.  See my actions and who I am instead trying to
impose your opinion with offenses.  :P
Uff...  God, I didn't say you are wrong.  It was an hypothesis.  Please,
think instead being so defensive.
and irrelevant thought?
I was answering to your comment, Juan.  Please, read again what you wrote
before.  My thoughts are so 'irrelevant' as yours.  Or do you *really*
think that everything you wrote is relevant for someone?  Sorry, the world
doesn't work this way!  :-)
Believe me, nobody says only 'relevant' things.  First of all, because
'relevance' is pretty subjective.  An important thing for me not
necessarily will be relevant for me, and vice versa.
respect they deserve?
Uff...  Juan, did you really read what I wrote before?  I am too lazy to
repeat everything again!  :(((
Sorry, I will stop to spend your time and also mine, Juan.  Believe me, we
both will be banned again if we make an infinite discussion here and I
certainly will win in the end.
I am not saying that I am right.  I am just saying I will win at the end.
Remember:  I can do the same things that you, and wearing high heels, make
up and dress.  And I am much more 'troll' and 'hard headed' than you can be
in this life and in all next lives, if they exist, hihi!  :D
I can be more boring and repetitive than you, my dear Juan, and I am
Brazilian.  Our national motto is "I am Brazilian and I never give up"
("Eu sou brasileiro/a e não desisto nunca"), hahaha!!!  ;D
Have a lovely night and sweet dreams, my dear!  Try the serotonin and
endorphins thing!  Your body will thank you!  <3
PS:  -  You are a _without fuck¡ng_ boring and grumpy old sir, but I still
like you, Juan.  A bit less, but I still would give you a cupuaçu
popsicle!  You can't stop my affection, la la la...  My feelings are mine,
not yours, hahaha!!      ;D
Yep, I know I am a _with fuck¡ng_ boring and grumpy old lady!

"beautiful thing".
I never said that exploding a city is a "beautiful thing".  I was not
talking about art, just about human nature.  Contrasts between destruction
and creation.
Sorry, I will leave the thread or I will spend millions of words to say the
obvious in an absolutely not polite way.
After telling that half of my family was killed because the city they used
to live was destroied, I think it is pretty hard to see a city exploding
and people dying under "an artistic point of view".

few years now, you should give a try.
mail server" - well consider this burner email address burnt.
find certain things useless.
Tsk, tsk...  Oh, my dear Master Y-Oda, your suggestions are a disgrace to
anarchists...  Bad, bad boy!  I will tell you horrible dad jokes and send
Justin Bieber lyrics until you stop being an anarchist disgrace!  ;)
Zen, I didn't know Master Y-Oda was here, but it was an unexpected joy.  I
call him 'FOdastico Mestre YOda'  (something like "F*cking Fantastic Master
YOda")  and several other strange names, because he is almost a "ninja
master" in several subjects, is a very practical person and has an awesome
sense of humor.
Yesterday, I wrote a long letter to a hackerspace and mentioned Master
Y-Oda as reference.  Believe me, you can not agree with his opinions and
suggestions, as I also do in some moments, but this guy does deserve our
respect, Zen.
Oda is able of discreetely trolling governments, always smiling and
listening to music.  Not necessarily good music, because we have pretty
different musical tastes in some moments, haha!!  ;D
He not only thinks out the box, he kicks the box, my dear.  Oda has an
amazing sense of humor, a fantastic intelligence, a strong personality and
a lovely hair.  Not so gorgeous as ryziek's hair, of course, but I love Oda
and all the things that make him so special.  Kind soul, practical actions,
unexpected ideas, creative hackings, dark sense of humor and beautiful hair
included, haha!!  ;D
Governments, police, teachers and my own parents can't make me stop an
argument.  Oda can do it just saying "Stop, Ceci".  I think it shows you
how much I respect him.  I have good reasons for it, Zen.
He was trying to help.  If you didn't appreciate his suggestions, believe
me, he absolutely doesn't care.  The same about being an anarchist
disgrace, hihi!  ;)
Warm hugs!

list. Wau. It proves so much.
that he'll bring you back to the tor list for your ""service"" (and don't
tell me you didn't think about that opening this thread.Oh no. You just
wanted to "open" our eyes to the goodness in boyce. oops).
No, I was just thinking about hardcore wild and hot sex with a guy who
hates me.  All that I want in my life is flirting with Boyce in public,
using the cpunks list.  Oh, the way he banned me was so sexy, Alex...  How
about telling everybody I was doing "ludicrous rape apologetics" in his
inbox?  Wow, it was really exciting!  Learn with him how to seduce a woman,
my dear!  :-)
Hahaha, talking seriously now...  Alex, my dear, what is the problem with
you in the last weeks?  Your last messages had more "f*ck this, f*ck that"
than my whole sexual life, you are much more aggressive than usual and you
simply didn't read the message content, silly boy!  :-/
When I forwarded the message, I was trying:
1)  to annoy Juan a bit.  I like him a lot and he knows it.
2)  to ask for some help for Lina, showing her thread in another list
(Liberation Tech).  Both, list and thread,can be interesting for some
people here, I suppose.
3)  to prove that even Boyce is able of good things, like _everybody_ in
this world.
I have a lot of things in common with Hitler, Alex.  I am a vegetarian who
loves children, animals, books, painting and German people too.  Am I a bad
person because of my preferences?  :-)
Boyce wrote to Lina in private, not in public, giving her a suggestion.  I
really appreciate kind and spontaneous support acts.  The fact he used
three sentences doesn't care.  In some moments, three simple words are
enough.  Some people can write books without saying something really
relevant.  Writing a lot doesn't mean anything, Alex.
I don't know if Boyce is a member of cpunks list or not, but it doesn't
care.  I don't want to be part of tor-talk list again and I know he is too
proud to apologize for being injust with his stupid allegations of rape
You don't know me enough, Alex.  Don't try to judge my acts using your way
of thinking as measure, please.  We are very different.
I don't know what "PR" means, but I probably will be annoied with you if I
search for its meaning.  I really did not understand the "service" part,
but I am sure you were so injust as Boyce.  Congratulations, Alexander.
You did it like a boss...  whoops, a Boyce!  ;)
Hihi...  Take care, silly boy.  :-)

act according to their schooling and training and upbringing, as best they
can - they're just doing their jobs you see.
The Latin word "mal"  (or "malus"),  used as root in several Latin
languages, means “bad” or “evil".  It was used in the origins of the words
"malice" and "malicious".
The etymology of this word makes explicit its meaning.  It is a "malicious
software".  An intentionally harmful software.
If you want to believe a "malware" can be a "goodware"  - or something
similar -  because people are good, is your option, but it definitely is
*not* a wise choice, in my humble opinion.

act according to their schooling and training and upbringing, as best they
can - they're just doing their jobs you see. I hear that some supporters of
the FBI are actually volunteers (friends of employees just helping out), so
they're really good guys. We cannot deny the FBI employees gainful
employment which provides them opportunities for honourable actions. At
least some of the time. At least, I assume so.
The people are good, but we have trolls and stupid persons in all places.
A good person can be really stupid, did you know it?  We can have stupid
people even in respected lists of discussion.  :-)
Recent examples in this list:  -  People saying I am making "rape apology"
when I am trying to stop a stupid lynch mob and severe human rights
violation.  People saying how "beautiful and artistic" was using a nuclear
bomb to explode the city where my family used living before being killed.
People saying I was flattering a guy just because of a stupid mailing list.
You know, we have disgusting people telling lies and writing stupid things,
making propaganda for corrupt politicians and institutions in every place
of this world, all minutes.  Even on the best mailing and discussion
lists.  And they never apologize when are injust.

Russian propaganda is always so interesting and useful...  yawn...  (-_-)
Psychopaths are opportunist guys, able of really disgusting acts  -
supporting other psychopaths, like Donald Trump, for example -  just for
having benefits.
Exactly what Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un did few months ago, do you
remember?  If not, search about.
You should search about KGB methods of torture and about Russian LGBTQ
rights too, please.  Putin has much more in common with Trump and CIA than
you would like to know.
Oh, and when it is convenient, Putin really appreciate USA a lot!!!  :D
Psychopaths never are very coherent, because they care only about their own
interests, not about real values and honor.
Please, consider using the "Put In panties" all the times when making PR
for Putin.  The Russian government will appreciate your cute act of
tenderness and the propaganda will be more effective, really unforgettable

The removal of content is happening since last month, my dear Lots of strange things are happening and there is evident censorship in
some places when you mention Jake's name.
This kind of thing makes me feel really upset and I am considering if was
correct to avoid cruel gossip, because it is disgusting, vile.  "JA group"
used this kind of despicable resource, but they are not a good and healthy
reference for normal people, with a little bit of ethics.  "Decent people",
using Quinn's favorite expression.  "Sane people", in my own code of ethics.
I never asked Jake about this fact, because it would sound disgusting and
non sense for him and he already has lots of more relevant worries.  I used
this embarrassing information for my personal conviction only.
We can't use this information in a trial, but I am sure he had no sexual
contact or approach with one of the alleged victims because he has a very
sensitive nose.
Jake is very clean and really cares a lot about personal hygiene.
Everybody knows how much he cares about his apparence and his smell always
is good, even after a longer talk.  A comfortable smell that remembers me
"cleanliness", daily baths and use of cleaning products, like soap,
shampoo, etc.
It is an important detail for a Brazilian person.  We do love water and
baths.  Brazilians usually are considered "bath addicteds" and "maniacs for
cleanliness, hygiene products and perfums" in whole world.
The girl is knowed in some activist circles for _not_ having an accurate
hygiene and for several disgusting intimate smells.  One of her ex-lovers,
who I've knowed in person, confirmed me it some weeks ago and I really felt
bad for her.
I don't know her in person and I don't know if she has a disease or just
unsanitary, unhygienic habits, but being associated with "sour cream",
"rotten cheese" and other bizarre odors is very humilliating.  He never had
courage to lick any part of her body and left her after two disastrous
sexual meetings.
Jake never would touch a stinky person in an intimate way.  He is too clean
for it and he could have sex with a better person very, very easily.
Sorry, I can't believe it.  He probably would reject her sexual advances,
exactly like her ex-lover did.
She is a revengeful person and, well, a rejected woman is the Hell in a
human form.  She said his ex-lover is gay and he doesn't like sex to some
people.  He is not gay and likes sex a lot, but only with clean women.  Not
her case!  :P
It was childish and cruel, but I confess when I was angry, I tried to play
with two horrible versions of "Smelly Cat"  (one of Phoebe' songs, Friends
sitcom),  provisionally called "Smelly Pussy" and "Smelly Little Cat" just
for making Jake laugh a bit.  It was a bad idea and I left it at all.  Jake
deserves good music and I sing like a banshee dying, uh!  :((
(I don't know if it is really used, but they teach a pussy is a "little
cat" for foreign people and I just learned it can be a bad word when I
tried to explain how much I love puppies and kittens to my ex-boyfriend.  I
said "I love pussies" and he laughed for a long time before explaining my
mistake...  d'oh!  :P)
Tender kisses.  Wish you all a lovely day!  :*
Cecilia, at hospital, in a horrible mood...  I've spent my whole week
visiting hospitals and strongly wished to die all the times after reading
dramatic Russian propaganda.  Too much drama and noise because of another
corrupt politician, who doesn't support LGBTQ rights and censors
philosophers, aff...  :(((
PS for   -  Stallman certainly likes scumbags, because is a
complete scumbag in some moments.  But I swear he is very funny and cute
when in the mood!  <3
I don't know if Jesus loves  but later I will share a cute comic book
named "Religion - Ruining Everything Since 4004 B.C.".  A lovely friend
sent me and I read it yesterday, at hospital, while complaining about God's
dark humor and bad jokes.
It was published under a Creative Commons license and I need to thank the
author for being so generous and fun.  He made me smile while my
temperamental body was rejecting medicines, so his book is good, hihi...  ;)

opinions into new synthesis of understanding.
Georgi was making a rethorical question only.  And, sorry, in my opinion,
Hegel is not the best answer.  I tried it when I was a pretentious

Zenaan and Alexander,
It's fun in some moments, but I decided to avoid feeding dumb trolls.  Time
and patience are very limited resources, so it probably will be my last
message for you both.  You are really boring, meh!  :(
Sorry, I don't respect dumb, stupid and pretentious people, with a huge
complex of superiority and an ego bigger than Putin's baldness.
But if you both want to complain about who has the biggest ego, please,
always remember:  -  I am fabulous, b¡tches.  You both are donkeys, I am a
colorful unicorn.  You walk, I parade.  You will be dust, I will be
glitter!  <3
Hahaha!!  Just joking for the lulz, but remember I am a professional troll
and you both are begginners and not so smart.  ;)
I am not a pig, but I prefer being juicy, tasty bacon than repulsive
Vegemite.  And I really love pearls.  They look great with dresses and high
heels.  Very classy!  <3
At least, I am really happy, because Zenaan finally stopped writing me in
private and copying me in every stupid message sent to a person of this
group.  It was ridiculous and non sense, but he spent more than a month to
perceive he was being ignored and/or rejected.  Very slow and disgusting
guy, ugh!  :(((
Happy oink, oink for you both!  (ˆ(oo)ˆ)
Cecilia, adopting Zen Chinchilla Philosophy from now on, hihi...  ;)
PS 1:  -  A person who really cares about another person, at least, try to
write correctly their name.  The problem was not misspelling Georgi's name,
but showing you simply don't care about him, even after spending zillions
of words trying to prove you really care about others.  Pure
contradiction.  "D'oh!" again, slow guy.
PS 2:  -  You probably will appreciate the "Zen Chinchilla Philosophy",
Mirimir.  Some years ago, I adapted an idea just to annoy a stupid guy and
used a chinchilla as example.  It worked well, but I should write a "Zen
Chichilla Manifesto" just for fun.  You know, I am so cute as a
chinchilla.  But  - thank God! -  not so furry, haha!!  ;D
Repeating:  -  Please, if I die in the next days, tell everybody that all
these disgusting and repetitive messages licking Putin's b at lls, ignoring
all the Russian government's fails, and against "The West", "The Empire",
etc, etc, killed me with infinite and painful boredom, ugh!  It's a cruel
torture, a real crime against the humanity!  :P
But, well, everything in Australia wants to kill you.  Aparently, also
Zenaan, even when pretending to be an eternal misunderstood victim of
society's ignorance.  Oh, poor Zen!  :'(

On Jul 24, 2016 7:01 PM, "Bastiani Fortress" to see your phone too when they do a routine check at the city center.
Please, consider using Signal or Telegram instead whatsapp.  I will test
Wire this week for fun.
They are not totally secure apps, but certainly are a bit better than
whatsapp.  I am a fan of Durov brothers' work, but I am still waiting for
an answer about this security fail for curiosity:
I don't know about migration to Europe as you asked in another thread, but
if the things become worst in Ankara, maybe could you consider to know
Brazil in person?  I am not interesting, but my neighbour is the always
charming Juan!  :P
I always say things like "Thank God I am Atheist!", but I sincerely try to
respect people's faith and, even considering God's existence very
uncertain, I always ask to God protect my loved ones.  It isn't a logical
thing, but I feel more comfortable because I know I can't protect my family
and my friends in all the moments.  Hope God, if exists, can love and feel
compassion for every single person in this crazy world.
I have Muslim friends and I was very frustrated yesterday because I've
found a Brazilian Telegram group saying awful, disgusting things about the
Islamism.  All the religions are about love.  There are crazy radical
people in all the religions and being a Christian doesn't mean anything.
It was very disgusting seeing so many people using Jesus and the Bible as
excuses to offend and to attack other persons, aff...  :((
Take care, my dear!  Warm straight hugs and my best wishes of inner peace
and hope!  Be strong!  :*

Off-Topic: Donald Trump's and Vladimir Putin's Shared Agenda Should Alarm
Anyone Concerned About Democracy
        In brief: In his business dealings, He, Trump seems
        increasingly dependent on money from Russia and from the
        former Soviet republics within its increasingly active sphere
        of influence. This is because most of the big banks on this
        side of the pond won't go near him without HazMat suits. (Gee,
        could it be that his sudden emergence as a Warren-esque
        crusader against the "rigged system" of the banksters is less
        of a principled opposition and simply pure animal vengeance?
        Unpossible!) As Marshall points out, this isn't exactly a deep
        corporate secret ... Marshall presents a judicious but
        comprehensive bill of indictment as regards He, Trump's
        relationship with Putin. He doesn't allege direct complicity,
        only a mutuality of interest that should alarm anyone
        concerned about the stability of American democracy. He also
        carefully traces the connections to Russia of several of He,
        Trump's crucial advisors. (I knew about Paul Manafort's
        connection to Putin's Ukrainian marionette, but the
        relationship that Carter Page, one of the campaign's key
        foreign-policy advisers, to Gazprom, the Russian energy
        behemoth that Putin controls, was a new one for me.) He shies
        away from the more baroque conspiracy theories, although I
        don't think the notion that Russian intelligence was behind
        the hack-and-release of 20,000 internal DNC e-mails at exactly
        the right time is that far-fetched.  This should be the only
        story about the Trump campaign until he comes clean.

Already tried them.  Apparently, carbs are yummy, but don't make miracles.
Juan can call me 'mal cogida' too, hahaha!!  ;D
Had bad news and was banned in another list.  Some people are not original,
meh!  :P
Giving Jake any kind of public support means being excluded, banned,
rejected, dumped, etc, etc.  Always the same noisy drama, bah!  ;P
I am still the same person, doing and saying exactly the same things, but
apparently, I am less charming now.  Considering that, one week ago, I was
considered 'the cutest person' in that group, my 'awesomeness' ended very
fast, hahaha!!!  ;)

Hi, Digitalfolklore!
Hope you wanted to send this message to cypherpunks lists, not for me in
special.  :)
I don't know exactly what is happening, but received some strange private
messages in different channels about Wikileaks.  Err...  Why me?  Did
someone say something or is just my famous oriental charm?  :-/
Usually, I love Wikileaks, but I do not support some of their last
actions.  Everybody knows about strange leaks to manage USA elections, the
Turkish leaks and deleted bizarre tweets.  These things annoyed me a lot.
I wasn't tweeting in the last times, but, few days ago, I admiss I tweeted
about    and retweeted one of Wikileaks' account
tweets about Jake.  Just it.
Only a cordial relationship between an institucional account and a poor
unknowed follower, who had lost a lot of friends, contacts and followers in
last months.  I am only lurking on twitter, avoiding flaming wars and
boring people.  No much patience for all the drama.
It's my usual behaviour in foreign lists too.  I only broke my typical
pattern because of Jake.  I was already an old reader here and on tor-talk
list, before being kickbanned.  I am very noisy and chaotical, and my
English stinks more than someone's... little cat!  So, silence is always
more comfortable for me, even being a talkative troll.  :)
Am I guilty of some of their bad leaks and was not informed about it yet?
They were noisy and chaotical, but not mine!  :)
Ah, I always make a lot of strange things, but not personalized panties.
If you want Snodew or Assange panties, you can suggest the idea to
Wikileaks.  Certainly they will be very sexy, but not like the charming
"Put in" panties, hihi!  :)
It would be fun to use Tor Project panties.  I still use their stickers in
my notebooks and devices, even after all this mess.  It's a pity that
g-strings have no much area to onions or Schneier facts, hahaha!!!  ;D
There are Schneier Facts T-shirts, but cryptography in panties would be
awesome, wow!!!  Loved the idea!!! Ok, I will consider it just for fun!  <3

plain text, phone numbers, addresses?

Muuuaaah!  :*  My dear Rayzer, thank you a lot for caring about me, but I
will answer to Juan.  I like him very much.  He has lots of patience with
me and is always teaching and explaining me several things.  He is nice and
feels pity when I don't understand bad words, wordplays and concepts of
anarchism.  And I do love to annoy him, hihi!  ;)
'Mal cogida' is a very very very bad word in Spanish, which he teached me.
I like him enough to say that he is the only guy in the world who can call
me 'mal cogida' without being kicked right in the balls with all my
strenght, hihi!  :)
Juan dear, sorry, I will answer to your message, but a bit later.  Now I am
very busy, burning all my bras because they are oppressing my breasts!  :P
Nah, it's a joke.  Cute bras are very expensive, hihi!  ;)
Talking seriously, I am really busy, need to finish a lot of crazy stuff
and was stupid enough to delete the draft of my answer about sexism when
was distracted, d'oh!  :P
Sorry, I won't write about it again right now.  It's a boring theme.  Talk
to you soon!  Kisses, take care and eat chocolate!  :*

Cari, please, respect Rayzer and everybody here.
What do you know about Jake?  Did you already meet him?
If you don't like him and you really think it is necessary, be polite and
tell your reasons in a less aggressive way.  It doesn't hurt.  You don't
need to be stupid to say what you think and why.
Jake is my friend and I really love him.  I don't know what happened, but
every person in this world deserves respect.
Take care.

Maybe a man can't see it, but even the most stupid woman in the world can
notice an evident *lie* in the last statment published.
The obvious efforts trying to adjust the accusations to being more
realistic and plausible, giving also more colours and emotions, are pretty
interesting.  I like it!  ;)
I didn't stop to search for some trustworthy information and for more
references in last days.
A programmer (woman) told me some 'juicy gossip' about one of alleged
victims, but it would be pretty disgusting to tell it here.  Ugh!  :-/
Well, in thesis, one of alleged victims is being hypocrite and hates
Jacob.  It was obvious since the first message, but some of the reasons
were unexpected for me, at least.  I need to search more information about
it and verify if it is really true before invite her to write a statment or
tell more about it in a trial.
Another tech woman, a brutally sincere friend who I love a lot and consider
one of the most intelligent persons that I know, perceived the lie that I
mentioned before I point it to her.  It simply does not make sense...  :-/
I always says my friend is a 'feminazi' who hates all the men and she knows
about it and says even worse things about me, hahaha!!  She is really
bitter sometimes, but pretty realistic and I do love extremely sincere
friends, haha!!  ;D
Well, she knows in person Jake, Isis and a lot of people mentioned and
doesn't like anyone.  None of them, I swear.  :P
Told me some stories about egocentrism, injured pride, politics, money,
etc, and asked me to avoid this kind of f*cking harmful crazy people
because I am too stupid to protect myself, haha!!  It makes sense, but now
I am curious about the truth, haha!!  ;D
She asked me to avoid meetings with one of alleged victims at any cost,
because "she is a f*cking sick jealous crazy b*tch", able of killing me and
tell lies about self-defense or psychotical breaks and lapses of memory in
public.  My friend is a bit neurotic, but is a good woman and is just
worried about me, hihi...  ;)
Just in case, the world is really small and I will contact one of the
ex-partners of this alleged victim in special.  I don't know him, but I
would like to know if she likes scandals, lies, breaking objects, this kind
of crazy stupid actions...  She has an ego much bigger than usual and I
know that Jake has the same problem, ugh!  :P
Warm hugs and tender kisses!!!  Ah, thank you everybody!!!  I received some
lovely messages about helping homeless people and two donations, yay!!!  ;D

I have no much pride.  I don't care about "begging", if the reasons are
important for me and other persons.
I want to learn more about Tor Project and I want to do it using my real
name and this personal account, because I use it for mailing and discussion
lists.  I have lots of accounts, but this is the public one, the less
important account.
I hate moderation, but I was and I am moderator in several lists, because I
am considered transparent and everybody can contact me easily, Juan.
My personal convictions about avoiding moderation at any cost, in a recent
past, had a really negative impact in one of the lists that I used to
moderate.  A poisounous guy made a real chaos in the discuss list.
It was a disaster because I knowed him in person and everybody knows I
really liked him a lot.  I wrote several advertising messages before put
him in moderated mode.  I never banned a person and he was the only person
that I put under moderation until now.
After being advertised about the moderation, he left a much more than 2.000
persons list, who always said "love too much", and offended me in several
personal channels, including cell phone and messengers.  I received dozens
of cruel messages telling about my friends' impressions about me.
After his disgusting messages for me, I was completely sure that I was
right choosing to moderate him and his destructive e-mails.  I was
protecting the readers of the list, Juan.  It was a proof of consideration
and respect, not censure.
A moderator can be an injust person and I already was victim of it several
times, but the moderator role in all the lists is protecting them and their
members.  I am a moderator and already was under moderation.  I know both
If you want, I can send all the references in private.  You will discover

happening.  I told him I asked about the tor-talk list moderation rules
weeks ago and had no answer about it.  I told him why I think it was really
disgusting and sick to call me a "ludicrous rape apologetics".  I told him
to put me under moderation, but permissing me to learn more about the Tor
Project, reading the list.  I promised to be on topic only.  Answers?  No,
I didn't receive any answer.
I don't know if someone told lies about it, but he didn't answer to my
messages and I gave up.  I said earlier that I won't waste more tears and
time with a loser able of calling a "rape apologetics" a victim of rape.
It was really unfair and cruel and, sorry, only a sick person makes this
kind of thing.
Boyce is the kind of guy able of telling lies to manipulate dumber people.
Ja.group proved it is pretty easy.
I know it can be really hard for you understand it, but some people around
the world really like to avoid guns, lies and moralist hypocrite discourses.
Ja.group members are still subscribed on tor-talk list and, as they did
before, they simply will create another account to post there.  I said I
want to use my real name and this personal account.  It is not hard to
understand it, is it?  :)

Oh, it was pretty obvious.  So sorry, Quinn, I thought it was a neurosis of
yours.  It is Boyce's neurosis, instead.  Or maybe just another lie.  :P
how to behave as a member of decent society. Threatening to rejoin a
mailing list one has just been booted from, is not how decent people behave.
My dear, I was waiting for Boyce's answer.  I asked humbly after his
offenses and had no answers, so I gave up.  Sorry, I won't die or be sick
because of it.  I cried yesterday, I admiss, but just because it was really
stupid calling me a "rape apologetics".
Today is a new day and I have several perspectives for my life and my
studies.  I don't need tor-talk list, it is past.  I will never use lies to
subscribe there.  My nature is really easy to understand.  I used my real
name and a public account in all the moments.  I like true colors.
And being sincere, probably I already read much more Law books and holy
books  (not only the Bible)  than you and I think it is really complex to
define how "decent people behave".  I don't have this kind of pretention.

PS:  -  Quinn contacted me in private and he was not talking about me.
Sorry again, Quinn!  :P
I asked him to apologize me and I was sincere, but I still think that using
a Federal Court to judge a person trying to read a list and not using the
same courts to judge persons who created that site is really bizarre.
Here, the ja.group would be judged for three different crimes against  (a
person's)  honor, at least.  They and the Tor Project would spend a
considerable amount of money paying civil and criminal indenizations.
Being sincere, I really don't know who tried to re-subscribe using another
account or if it was just another lie.  You all know, everybody in the Tor
Project loves "alleged victims" that never show proofs, hihi...  ;)
In private, some people said they didn't try subscribe again.  I swear I
did not, so I don't know if someone really tried to subscribe using threats
or not.
Juan and I had some private conversation yesterday night about moderation
and I think he understands me better now.  He doesn't agree, but now

Also talking about love, several of my personal friends are
North-Americans, Juan.  I love and respect them a lot and I would die for
some of them right now, if necessary.  Ex-boyfriend included, hihi!  :-)
I make my jokes about North-American ego trips, but it is just a fool
clichÃ© to annoy some few persons.  In general, I really love them.  There
are lots of good people in all the countries, my dear.
You, for example, are Argentine and I love you, hahaha!!  Sorry, Juan,

Now you have the right of kicking me very strongly too.  If we meet
someday, we can take a pic holding onions and bacon before kicking each
other, hahaha!!    :D

think they won't beat me up or burn me with cigarettes in a court.  It's a
better option for me, less painful, ugh!  :P

bad, but sometimes 'justified'(or something like that).
saying that banning all the people that tor-fascists banned was 'justified'
'ok' or whatever.
Hey, I did not say it at all, hard headed Juan!  :P
But it is their list and their rules, being unjust or not.  If they want to
censor their list in a dishonest and stupid way, using bad excuses, they
will lose credibility, respect and collaborators.  Their problems, not mine.
If censorship is OK 'sometimes', then she can't complain about being
censored 'sometimes', like 'this' time.
Sorry, I wanted to read the list and don't care about following rules to do
it, if necessary.  Social rules, for example:  - In the Summer, I really
prefer to be nude all the time, but I use clothes or I will be arrested.

stupid, limited and cruel for calling a raped woman, a "ludicrous rape
I know it is a terrible bad karma, but I would love to graffitti these
exact words in his house.  So Boyce would be able to understand how heavy

Thank you, my dear, but it is not the same thing.  I want to be formaly
subscribed and receive aaaall the lovely messages in my inbox.  You know me
enough to understand my personal position, Juan.  :)
If the people behind ja.group are still subscribed, even after using two
fake accounts to humilliate and harass a person, why can't I be subscribed
too?  :)
Some of the people behind the lynch mob already told their names and they
are still in the tor-talk list.  Only two fake accounts were banned.  The
real accounts are normally subscribed.  Not fair, not reasonable.  It says
a lot about the moderation team's preferences.
If I had told lies using a fake account, my personal account would be still
protected and subscribed.  Instead, I decided to expose myself in an honest
way and I am being punished for not using a fake account to defend Jake.
You know, being sincere and transparent is not a valuable thing for
hypocrite people.
Do you remember the jokes that I told about my personal convictions, Juan?
I am millions of times more hard headed than you, my dear.  Just wait,
hihi!  :)
among left-wing fascists to pretend to care oh so much about women, while
ignoring cases where women are actually hurt.
Yeah, I confess I was waiting for formal excuses because he is pretending
to be politically correct.  I am pretty disappointed.  He is a bad actor
and not much smart.  The lies about banned people using threats to
subscribe again were stranger than his disgusting offenses about rape
apology.  Sick guy, really disturbing, eeck!  :-/
Well, hope he learns how to fake better with his friends of ja.group.  It
is pretty stupid, Juan, but I was trying to sing a bit of Bob Marley,
hihi...  ;)
Bad Boyce, bad Boyce, whatcha gonna do, whatcha gonna do when they come for

Being sincere, I thought Rayzer was just being ironic, making a joke about
Boyce's polite words to Juan and the banned people.
Few minutes after sending this message, Rayzer condemned Boyce's banning
acts in another message.  He is not supporting the banning, Juan.
When I received Boyce's message wishing "best of luck", I admiss I thought
"Oh, thank you, Mr. Boyce.  Please, go to Hell with all my cumpliments and
have a lovely journey.".  Polite messages are cute!  <3
Creepy guy.  Boyce, not Rayzer or you, Juan.  Better avoiding more

Ah, Rayzer...  I like you a lot, but if you spank me, I think Juan will
feel a bit jealous, hihi...  :D
No, not because he loves you...  just because he wants to spank me too,
hahaha!!  And throw dozens of onions at my head, hahaha!!  ;D
My "feminazi" friend hates men and Tor, so I used to send her some pics
holding onions, with male friends in non sense situations.  She always
sends me pics using leather and fur, holding bacon, hamburgers, barbecue,
dildos, crazy neon preservatives, messages saying "Die, vegan nazi!
Barbecue is life!", this kind of lovely things, hahaha!!!  ;D
I told Juan about our jokes and he was not offended with the bacon and the
burgers, but he absolutely doesn't like my relationship with Tor and
onions, hahaha!!  ;D

You use a lot the adjective "decent".  Please, your patterns of decency are
_not_ exactly the same adopted in a punk community or even in several
countries around the world.  Mine, for example.
I am not being ironic or agressive.  I am talking too serious with you.
Sorry, asking for moderation here, in this specific list, makes no sense.
It would be really wrong.
I was banned from tor-talk mailing list for defending a victim of brutal
harassment and accusations with no proofs.  This victim is my friend and is
being attacked for a lynch mob.  Is it not decent for you?
I already had seen Jake in several talks before, but he just becomes my
friend when I saw him crying for Aaron Swartz.  I learned to love him after
it.  I was crying next to him and I was a cute, fragile, young girl, but he
prefered to comfort and to hug a fat, tall, not so young man, who was
crying much more than us together.
Jake never knowed, but the tall North-American guy that, years ago, he
hugged in a so sweet way is one of the persons that I more respect in the
whole world.  I could die for this guy now if he needs it, because he has a
huge, amazing heart, one of the kindest souls that I know and he really
believes in a better world and works hard for it.
I think Jake never will remember me, but that was the first time I saw him
as a friend.  Jake was not a "rock star" (ridiculous expression used for
some people), he was just a sad boy crying for a dead friend, for Aaron's
lost dreams...  I've spent a long time just seeing them hugging each other
and, even not being the best of creatures, I sincerely prayed for them,
asking God to bless both and Aaron' soul and his family.
When Jake left my friend, I also hugged him, my huge lovely crying teddy
bear...  Jake saw our hug with some curiosity because he saw me watching
them for a long time.  I was hugging my friend and Jake saw my eyes still
crying.  My head was almost behind my friend's arm, because he is much,
really much taller than me.  Jake was not so close and made me a signal,
asking me if I needed something.  I smiled, so he smiled and finally left
the room.
After it, I already saw Jake crying, blushing, smiling, laughing, missing
more friends, dead and alive...  God, do you really think that would be
decent to let stupid blind people destroy my friend's life?!  If you think
it is decent, sorry, I reject your concept of decency now and will reject
it all the days of my life.
I prefer to be banned of all existent mailing and discussion lists than
supporting something so infamous, so disgusting...
Take care and (re)think about your concepts of decency, please.

"Americans".  There are also Latin America and South America, not only
North America.  The world is really small, but much more complex than most

Thought this would be of great interest to those of you studying media
geography and online bias.  The Google Trends group created for me a map of
how often Americans have searched about each country in the world thus far
in 2016. Turns out it matches quite closely the attention paid to each
country by American television coverage 2009-2016. Africa, Central Asia and
the Baltics are standouts, along with Southern Europe.  Thought this was
quite fascinating to pair up all of the work being done on media geography
and online bias with the use of search volume as a proxy for American
public interest in those countries.

Below, a small excerpt of Neil deGrasse Tyson's last speech in the new
"Cosmos" series.  It is really beautiful and inspiring not only for
researchers, but for everybody who wants to search for truth.
"How did we, tiny creatures living on that speck of dust, ever manage to
figure out how to send spacecraft outer among the stars of the milky way?
Only a few centuries ago, a mere second of the cosmic time.  We knew
nothing of where and when we were.  Oblivious to the rest of the cosmos, we
inhabited a kind of prison, a tiny universe bounded by a nutshell.
How did we escape from the prison?  It was the work of generation of
searchers, who took 5 simple rules to heart.
Question authority.  No idea is true just because someone says so,
including me.  Think for yourself.
Question yourself.  Don't believe anything just because you want to.
Believing something doesn't make it so.
Test ideas, by the evidence gained from observation and experiment.  If a
favorite idea fails a well designed test, it's wrong.  Get over it.
Follow the evidence, were ever it leads.  If you have no evidence, reserve
And perhaps even the most important rule of all, remember you could be
wrong.   Even the best scientist have been wrong about somethings.  Newton,
Einstein, and ever other great scientist in history.  They all made
mistakes.  Of course they did, their were human."

Cryptography pioneer Marty Hellman calls for compassion in personal, cyber,
and international threats
        Hellman no longer does crypto research, though he retains a
        position at Stanford; instead, he has been advocating for
        changes in policy that acknowledge the new, more
        interconnected global community.  "I see cyberweapons as very
        similar to nuclear weapons," he said. "Early on we had a
        monopoly on nuclear weapons so we thought they were the
        greatest thing going. But unlike a nuclear weapon, a
        cyberweapon doesn't destroy itself, so like with Stuxnet, our
        adversaries were able to take it apart and figure out how it
        works. We need to start thinking this through more carefully."

But I swear I will read it with care and attention.  I absolutely do love

kill one of my stalkers, but it would be pretty hard to hide his body and
killing a person wouldn't be a vegan thing, uff...  :-/

One of my craziest friends invited me to travel with him to know an
indigenous tribe and use an hallucinogen made with frogs' poison.  He
already tried it three times, really loved it and swears it will heal my
broken heart.  So I told him the cheekiest lie of my life to avoid hurting
his feelings...  "Oh, Dani, poison extracted from frogs?  Sorry, it is not
vegan!"  :P  :P  :P
( I am not vegan anymore, just veggie, but he doesn't need to know it or
will invite me to taste one of his hallucinogen teas, uh!  Luckly, he
thinks vegans are a kind of 'radical veggie nazis', who don't taste
anything without "free animal cruelty" labels.  It is not true, but it is
pretty convenient for me!  "Sorry, Dani, your hemp is a plant, but it has
no labels.  Is it organic?" Hahaha!! )
