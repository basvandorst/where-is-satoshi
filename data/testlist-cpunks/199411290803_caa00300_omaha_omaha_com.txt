Is it just me, or does this come up every few months?
They are already there - in elm and pine, as well as many others.
No need to kludge anything.  Take a good look at the PGP docs - they will
let you do exactly what you want.
I'm running Linux here, and have run it both as static/dynamic SLIP, and hung
(well!) off a T1 line.
This last one is really the only advantage to running cfs, IMO.
Here's the set of scripts I use here.  Others use more sophisticated ones, but
I'm not into shell programming ;}
pgpview will decrypt to the screen, vie will edit then encrypt, vis will edit
then sign.  They are intended to be used from within elm.

# 2. Save the resulting text in a file.
# 3. Execute the file with /bin/sh to create:
