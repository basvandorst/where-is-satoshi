Could you IMAGINE the gubmint trying to take every internet provider and
major website operating in the US to court?
Shut down Twitter and Yahoo!'s US ops?
Note that in the wake of the Snowden dox quite a few high profile
internet providers and services publicly asked the feds to let them
publish what they knew. That ALONE would be in vi-0-lation, wouldn't it?

On 04/01/2015 10:34 AM, Lodewijk andré de la porte quotes me:
...and replies:
Of course I've heard of punitive punishment and CERTAINLY 'selective
enforcement', which IS how laws are enforced in my California coastal
tourist/college town, but it requires that the non-persecuted internet
providers sit idly by while their users are punished. NOT a good way to
keep current users or acquire new ones .
There have been instances here where the non-persecuted backed the
persecuted about local nuisance ordinances leading to their modification
or annulment.
The non-persecuted (Yuppies with dogs) successfully pressured the city
into quitting their selective enforcement of people who WERE being
persecuted for their pets downtown by often simply not LOOKING LIKE
'gentry' and confronting the judges with their disgust that such a law
as 'no dogs' should exist.
It would also be VERY HARD to get jury convictions IF the non-persecuted
internet providers scoffed a law en masse with impunity, and gubmint
went ahead with persecuting the other cohort without secret star
chamber-like trials for the proles.
At THAT point the gubmint may have bigger problems than site owners
ignoring a ban on Warrant Canaries.

Sorry. Should have looked at the address line before hitting Send
61 years old. Been at it all my life from 14 year old anti-vietnam war
protester in NY stalked by the NYPD's red squad (using institutional
slander and harassment tactics that the NSA is now capable of using on
anyone anytime at the push of a PRISM search 'I feel lucky' button) to now.
Personally I think the 'powers that be' are too powerful to confront
head on except as a diversionary tactic. However, the
"Death-of-a-thousand-cuts" approach could conceivably work to change the
structure of American government (the only one I'm familiar with) ,
given a 'critical mass' of 'knife wielders'.
But, to paraphrase Thomas Jefferson, If you turn your back on the
bastids they're at it again, so the 'struggle' must continue unabated
with or without that mass support, or support from the non-affected . (A
labor of love really... Revolutionaries are guided by great feelings of

I AM, for what it's worth, a journalist of sorts, and the FIRST RULE of
Journalism ethics is:
The journalist is NEVER supposed to be (and perhaps harder, 'become, in
the process of reporting...') part of the story they're covering.
There’s really nothing unethical about being with corpses in news
footage and I don't have the foggiest where you heard that, but it's
worth noting ABCCBSNBCCNN won't run images of their people with corpses
on the air, which is most likely why you claim 'it never happens'
Those aforementioned outlets aren't really journalistic media anyway.

Wait what? The ONLY reference I find in a google search for "Cari Machet

NBCNews, a Cattlepist(sic) 'news' source.
Your problem is you fail to capitalize the names and you speak of them
as if you know them when you undoubtedly don't. The latter marks you as
a nutcase in my estimation.
I truly believe, as the alt-news syndicated journalist

What you know about Journalism Cari, "could be written on the head of a
pin by a spastic stone-cutter."

References: <20150430143947.GA2661
    "The Baltimore police have murdered 109 people since 2010, and have
    paid out more than $6 million in police brutality settlements since
    2011. Now they want us to believe that ‪ broke his own
    neck??!  How stupid do the Baltimore City Police think we are??!"
    (src, Brave New Films     )
Here's how the legal end is going...
The Baltimore police say they will NOT issue a report Friday as planned
 regarding the
death-in-detention of Freddie Gray: The report will be turned over to a
prosecutor, even as they leak 'evidence' Gray 'beat himself to death'
Snap analysis of what this means:
Baltimore’s District Attorney, like ALL court prosecutorial staff, works
for the police. The prosecutor gets to pick and choose what evidence a
Freddie Gray Grand Jury might hear, and you can be SURE the evidence
will not show the victim to be non-culpable for his own death.
Further, according to US Department of Just-Us “guidelines’
 “/Law enforcement
actions based on fear, panic, misperception or even poor judgement do
not constitute wilful conduct prosecutable under the statute/.”. Proof
of malicious intent to kill is required for a police officer’s murder
conviction in the United States, and since no one but police officers know…
Right now, the Baltimore Police department has ‘indirectly provided
that Freddie Gray beat himself to death banging his body against the
inside if the police van he was imprisoned in. Really?
The bottom line is this… If the public demands a murder charge in the
killing of Freddie Gray, or the prosecutor hypocritically charges the
officer/(s)/ with murder, the officer/(s)/ WILL be acquitted.
Expect no justice for Freddie Gray and you won’t be disappointed.
Cribbed from my Tumblr My Freddie Gray tags I DO want to point out someone's response
 to white folks who
say shit like “we don’t burn down our neighborhoods when we get angry,”,
b/c American Narcissistic Myopia:
What the author, anti-racism author and essayist Tim Wise who wrote that
says afterwards about what needs to be done to cause any change
whatsoever in US policing gets a "+1" from me.

I can speak to airbnb. I watched a city council meeting a few months ago
as a bunch of airbnb 'homeowners' (investment properties they MIGHT live
at) hammered the talking point over and over again that having people
rent their space by the day or week and go touristing is somehow better
for the economy of my town than having someone who lives in a unit year
round, goes shopping for groceries every week, has his car work done at
a local garage etc.
This happened at a meeting that was ostensibly to discuss the housing
crisis in my Monterey Bay area town where a studio apartment rents for
$2,000/month and no one who works for any average business based in the
town makes anywhere NEAR that kind of money.
The city council creeps just sat there mute. Not ONE OF THEM said "Can
you show us any numbers to prove this??, because they long ago had
prostituted themselves to mostly non-local commercial property interests
and they had no intrinsic argument with airbnb's view.
The problem with the "Sharing Economy" is that it only shares with other
people involved in that 'economy' and excludes others. That's feudal,
and Feudalist sharing is NOT sharing for the benefit of a whole
community. It's sharing for the benefit of a few. What else would you

"Donald Trump has suggested shutting down the Internet by migrating
everyone to Internet Explorer 11.
Claiming the web is dangerous and people are being radicalised through
exposure, Trump has pledged to talk to Bill Gates in an effort to make
certain content unavailable by increasing buffering times until they
just get bored and decide not to be terrorists after all.
Microsoft proudly boasts that downloading a single pdf copy of the
Anarchists Cookbook over IE11 can take up to 17 hours, which would deter
even the most dedicated jihadi.
Trump has insisted that it would not be policy to shoot people who use
Chrome and Firefox on sight, but they would be encouraged to walk down
the street more often which amounts to much the same thing.
“I’m gonna see Bill Gates about closing up that whole Internet
doohickey,” Trump told reporters
“We’re losing a lot of people because of the Internet.
“We have to see Bill Gates and a lot of different people that really
understand what’s happening.
“We have to talk to them about, maybe in certain areas, closing that
Internet up in some ways. Somebody will say, ‘Oh freedom of speech,
freedom of speech.’ These are foolish people.”
Bill Gates has reportedly claimed that shutting the Internet down will

One of the things my dad bequeathed me was an Omega "Moon Watch"... at
least that's the way Omega advertised them. What was unique about the
one I had vs the advertised store variety was the fact that it was an
old fashioned wind-up, as opposed to the retail version, a self-winder.
Why the difference? As my dad put it "We didn't know if a self-winder
would work in zero-gravity", and they weren't willing to take the risk.
If the moon landing was a hoax, it was such an intricate one it would
have cost more to execute then actually landing someone on the moon.

I wonder who could be doing this...
*Turkish Internet hit with massive DDoS attack*
By Efe Kerem Sozeri
Turkey  is under massive cyberattack. Since Monday morning, the country's official domain name servers have
been under a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack
. The
attack’s perpetrators are unknown, but it reveals the vulnerabilities of
the country’s Internet infrastructure.
All domain names that end with Turkey’s two-letter country code .tr
 must be registered by NIC.tr
an administration office in Turkey’s capital of Ankara. Besides its
registration duties, NIC.tr maintains the academic internet backbone for
Turkish universities. It’s also the main service for .tr domain names,
making it a valuable target.
On Monday morning Turkish time, traces of an attack became noticeable.
By noon, NIC.tr’s five nameservers, ns1.nic.tr through ns5.nic.tr,
werecompletely down under a 40 Gigabits per second DDoS  attack.
    . at adililhan  Two of the routes
    hosting nic.tr experienced instability yesterday
    pic.twitter.com/OHk3dF0Bxo     — Dyn Research ( December 15, 2015
Europe’s regional Internet registry, the RIPE Network Coordination
Centre, serves as a secondary Domain Name System to Nic.tr. RIPE was
also severely affected
As noted
 by its
manager of the Global Information Infrastructure, Romero Zwart, the
attack was “modified to evade” RIPE's mitigation measures. As of this
writing, the attack is still going on at around 40 Gbps, disrupting
working hours
in Turkey.
DDoS attacks, which overload servers with requests for information, are
a simple way of disrupting a website for a brief amount of time. The
cost of hiring attacking
 botnets
, huge armies of compromised computers
that can all visit a site at the same time, is getting cheaper, and the
size of attacks is growing each year
. In
2013, an average DDoS attack was about 2 Gbps. In 2014, it’s nearly 8 Gbps.
While a 40 Gbps attack still sounds huge, security experts
say that even 400 Gbps attacks, like one recently reported
by DDoS mitigation service Cloudflare, are “the new normal.”
What makes the Turkish attack so damaging is the attackers’
sophisticated choice of target. By focusing on a relatively small group
of IP addresses, the five nameservers of NIC.tr, the attackers managed
to “take down the DNS system of a whole country with a 40 Gbps attack:”
      40GBitlik saldirida butun bir
    ulkenin alan adlari sisteminin cokmesi kabul edilemez               — Mehmet Akcin ( December 15, 2015
As the country’s official domain suffix, .tr domain names are very
popular in Turkey, and many local companies want their businesses
officially recognized for their local audience. There are about 400,000
websites  with
localized Turkish domain names, including 300,000 companies. It's also
used by government institutions, schools, municipalities, Turkish e-mail
servers , and the Turkish
When the attack left NIC.tr’s DNS service non-responding, practically
all .tr domain names became unreachable. Besides the private Turkish
companies, official government businesses such as vital population
registry queries, remained interrupted for more than a day. Internet
access at university campuses are still down or extremely slow.
On Monday evening, Turkey’sNational Response Center for Cyber Events
 closed all incoming traffic to NIC.tr from
outside of Turkey, which made 400,000 websites with .tr domain names
unreachable from the rest of the world, all e-mails sent to companies
and organisations with .tr domains bounced back with the “unknown host”
Response Center changed its policy late Monday night, and NIC.tr has
since been running a selective block policy for a number of suspected
root IP addresses. DNS service for .tr domains were also re-configured
 to
distribute the queries among public and private servers, including a
Turkish Internet service providers Superonline and Vodafone.
It’s notoriously difficult to attribute where a cyberattack comes from.
Many Turkish commentators have pointed to Russia
 as the source of the attack. Russia’s
cyber warfare capabilities
are an established weapon, believed to be used against Estonia in 2007
, Georgia in
and Ukraine in 2014
With Turkey’s recent downing of a Russian jet
 near Syrian border,
and with the ongoingtroll wars
between Erdoğan’s and Putin’s social media campaigners, DDoS botnets
could be the next battleground. Some experts have speculated this is a
response to Turkey’s nationalist cyber teams, who stand accused of
organising aDDoS attack on Russia’s Sputnik news
    It's highly probable that ddos attacks on nic.tr and tr ISPs are
    retaliation to recent      ddos attacks
    — Umut Simsek ( December 15, 2015
DDoS attacks are by nature distributed, therefore the identity of the
attackers could never be found out; but the consequences identified the
vulnerabilities of the target very well.

@_subject: Standard Operating Procedure 303 
On January 8 2016 the US Supreme Court will consider a petition for
certiorari in the EPIC v. DHS "Standard Operating Procedure 303" FOIA
suit. SOP 303 is also known as the 'National Emergency Wireless Kill-Switch'
“Standard Operating Procedure 303,” is the protocol that codifies a
“shutdown and restoration process for use by commercial and private
wireless networks during national crisis.”
Moreover, the justices are expected to clarify: “the scope of FOIA’s
“Exemption 7(F),” which allows the government to withhold “records or
information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the
extent that the production of such law enforcement records or
information … could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or
physical safety of any individual.”
    The central question raised by Exemption 7(F) is whether the
government has to be able to identify with any specificity the
“individual” whose life or physical safety might be endangered by
disclosure of the requested law enforcement records. In 2008, the Second
Circuit answered that question in the affirmative in ACLU v. Dep’t of
Defense. In its February 2015 decision affirming the government’s
rejection of EPIC’s FOIA request, the D.C. Circuit held expressly to the
contrary. As I explain in the post that follows, not only is this
division of authority sufficiently important so as to justify the
Supreme Court’s intervention no matter how the Court ultimately rules,
but, in my view, the Second Circuit clearly has the better reading of
Exemption 7(F) as a matter of statutory purpose, structure, and policy.
    I.  The Second Circuit and the PNSDA
    The story begins with FOIA requests filed in 2003 by the ACLU and
other organizations seeking records related to the treatment and death
of detainees held in US custody overseas after September 11, and records
related to the practice of “rendering” some of those detainees to
countries known to use torture. The litigation over the ACLU’s request
eventually reduced to a dispute over at least 29 (and perhaps thousands
of) photographs of detainees and detainee abuse in Afghanistan and Iraq.
In June 2006, the district court ordered the release of 21 of those
photographs (with proper redactions to alleviate privacy objections),
and the government appealed, arguing that the photographs were covered
by Exemption 7(F) insofar as their release would likely incite violence
against US personnel in Afghanistan and Iraq.”

ROTF. I suppose the CARPET BOMBING of Baghdad based on nothing but a
pack of lies (still being reiterated, recently in one major media outlet
as: "Saddam was in touch with islamists for assistance...") was
something to 'sing and dance' about?

Arabia to bomb and strafe Yemen, a country that never even had a
functional Air Force was cause for celebration.
Osama was never heard at Tora Bora (per US dox showing the intel
apparatchik totally lost sigint on him in 1998) yet we used a blatant
lie about hearing him at the old NATO sigint eavesdropping facility

well), he was told to use as he destabilized a nascent secular
Afghanistan b/c "Russians" and "Communism" and then we let the Islamist

yet?" His reply was a vigorous nodding to the affirmative.

People will continue to use cars like this because there's no option
sans restoring an older vehicle and keeping it maintained with a
diminishing supply of increasingly costly parts. Eventually, in many
states, those cars will be refused registrations due to 'environment',
and possibly 'fuel economy'. If they're allowed to continue on the road,
they'll be antique-plated and milage-per-year limited.

References: -------- Forwarded Message --------
Reply-To: 	liberationtech Newsgroups: 	gmane.technology.liberationtech
Hello LiberationTech subscribers,
SeeOnce is a new web app that encrypts text and files with forward
secrecy. This is achieved by changing keys with every message rather
than using a server to store keys or encrypted material. SeeOnce
consists of a single, relatively small html document, which doesn't
connect to any servers. It is based on a javascript implementation of
TweetNaCl, plus WiseHash, a dictionary-based key entropy meter that adds
a variable number of scrypt key stretching rounds for weaker keys.
Forward secrecy is obtained through a protocol similar to OTR messaging,
except that communications are expected to be asynchronous. SeeOnce
connects to the browser's default email through conventional mailto and
web links, so users don't need to install anything. Removal of ephemeral
data can be done via a single button.
Another important goal is to make key exchange transparent to the user,
so that even complete novices can use it right away.
Please take a look at SeeOnce and give us any suggestions you might
think appropriate. The preferred way is by starting Issues at the
project's GitHub page at:
The app is directly downloadable from  A Chrome app,
able to synchronize its data through Google servers, is available
Thank you very much.

I want to beg the point here. One of the guidelines of American society
was implicit, institutionalized racism, and many people were punished in
myriad ways for trying to change that. Some ended up dead.
When I was a chld back in elementary school (vamping on Jim Morrison
vamping on Lord Buckley), knee bends were a common gym exercise. Now
they're known to cause knee damage and no longer practiced as part of a
current school gym fitness program.
Being able to swim meant you were a witch.
Should I continue listing examples?
I'd rather rant.
Society punishes people alright, but that doesn't make that society's
judgment correct, moral or ethical.
I'd say the same for punishment of children for not performing to their
parent's expectations assuming the child was not in any physical danger,
and parents in American society often think the most harmless things are
dangerous... Because they simply 'don't get out very much'.
Wear a beard in my town full of clean-shaven upwardly mobile yuppies and
dinks and they shy away from you like you're Charlie Manson incarnate.
But simply go bald-faced, and no one thinks your strange at all until
they find out after-the-fact you're going out to fern bars picking up
women in your Izod Dockers and rollie costume for the purpose of raping
Most industrial society parents are literally vicious morons and they
should NOT be allowed to punish children for not conforming. Native
Americans didn't, and in my child-rearing years I didn't, and you know,
my kids turned out just fine thanks.

Expecting criminals to adjudicate themselves as such is a little beyond

for the moment. The US subscribes to the UN charter and what passes for
international law, which to a huge extent the US had a guiding hand in
The UN allowed the United States leeway to literally invade Iraq based
on evidence presented known to be lies at the time they were told, by
almost everyone in the US government in a position to authorize policy,
diplomatic OR war-related, on Iraq
The US government and all of it's executives committed a criminal act
under international law by invading Iraq under false pretenses and
therefore IS an international criminal enterprise that continues to this
day in that country by our continued, and eternal (at least until the
oil from there and Iran runs out) presence.

More Huxley than Orwell perhaps, but one look at the downtown shopping
district in my 'hood and you'll see cctv cams everywhere and undeputized
private patrol security guards on the street literally blackshirting
young people, the poor, and displaced workers (Blackshirting... like
making up illegitimate definitions of laws and ganging up on people who
refuse to comply. I dialed 911 on these thugs one day when three of them
surrounded me for sitting at a perfectly legal streetside window-ledge
and when the officer arrived I was refused a citation that I was more
than willing to take b/c the officer couldn't legally cite me.)

I accept that the Banker's Coup against FDR (exposed by Smedley Butler
of "War is a Racket" fame) culminated in part as the assassination of
JFK. Even as he was speaking the words (paraphrase) 'There are dark

Before that time they were referred to as "Charge Plates" and the
companies issuing them expected PAYMENT IN FULL at EOM.
Those revolving charge cards, which were sent en masse without request

locked into an insidious form of economic slavery... Typically for the

As one very wise native American (Black Elk) once said when asked what
he thought about 'modern progress':
    "I guess it depends on what you're progressing towards."
I posit everyone’s so busy 'progressing', that for the last century...
perhaps the entire timeline of the industrial revolution, NO ONE has
been noticing what they're progressing towards.
Namely self-annihilating the species. I'd much rather "annihilate
'progress'" thanks.
"Yet hear me, friends! we have now to deal with another people, small
and feeble when our forefathers first met with them, but now great and
overbearing. Strangely enough, they have a mind to till the soil, and
the love of possessions is a disease in them. These people have made
many rules that the rich may break, but the poor may not! They have a
religion in which the poor worship, but the rich will not! They even
take tithes of the poor and weak to support the rich and those who rule.
They claim this mother of ours, the Earth, for their own use, and fence
their neighbors away from her, and deface her with their buildings and
their refuse. They compel her to produce out of season, and when sterile
she is made to take medicine in order to produce again. All this is
sacrilege." ~Tatanka Iyotake (Sitting Bull)

kinds of acts including terrorism, designed to convince people in those
countries they'd be safer hanging with Western Industrial Capitalism

Was The U.S. Involved In The Turkish Attack Against The Russian Jet?
    Erdogan criticized Syria harshly on Tuesday for shooting down the
Turkish fighter jet, saying: "Even if the plane was in their airspace
for a few seconds, that is no excuse to attack."
    "It was clear that this plane was not an aggressive plane. Still it
was shot down," he said.Turkey hardens military position after Syria
downs jet June 27, 2012
    A violation of one to two kilometers is accepted as "natural" given
the speed of aircraft, the statement [by the the General Staff] said.
This year's violations of Turkish airspace lasted between 20 seconds and
nine minutes, which showed "airspace violations can be resolved by
warning and interceptions," the statement said.
    Turkey could have downed 114 planes for airspace violations: Army
June 25, 2012
    Turkish fighter jets and military helicopters have dramatically
increased their incursions into Greek airspace, according to a study
based on data from the Greek military, forcing the cash-strapped Greek
air force to respond.
    Turkey buzzes weakened Greece - In growing numbers Ankara’s fighter
jets test Greek territorial claims. - July 23, 2015
Turkey also regularly violates Iraq's airspace by flying bombing attacks
against Kurds in north Iraq.
All this provides that yesterday's incident in which Turkey shot down a
Russian jet was not a case of an ordinary airspace violation but a
deliberate act to take down a Russian plane. The surviving co-pilot of
the Russian jet insists that it neither flew through Turkish airspace
nor was warned of an imminent attack. As I wrote yesterday:
    This then was not legitimate air-defense but an ambush.
I am not the only one who came to that conclusion. Deep inside a
McClatchy piece a "western" diplomat sees it as an "orchestrated" event:
    One Western diplomat based in Iraq, but with extensive experience in
Syria and Turkey, called the incident “brazenly orchestrated and
inevitable,” but asked that the identification of his country not be
used in the statement.
The Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov also came to that conclusion:
    The downing of a Russian warplane in Syria by Turkey appears to be a
pre-planned provocation, the Russian Foreign Minister said. Ankara
failed to communicate with Russia over the incident, he added.
    “We have serious doubts that this act was unintentional. It looks
very much like a preplanned provocation,” Lavrov said, citing Turkey’s
failure to maintain proper communication with Russia, the abundance of
footage of the incident and other evidence.
Several NATO ambassadors will have had the same though when they
admonished Ankara over the act:
    "There are other ways of dealing with these kinds of incidents,"
said one diplomat who declined to be named.
The attack on the Russian plane was preconceived on November 22 when a
security summit was held with the Turkish government under Prime
Minister Davutoğlu and the Turkish Armed Forces. Davutoğlu personally
gave the order to shoot down Russian planes. This, Turkey says, was
necessary to stop Russian bombing of "Turkmen" in north Syria's Latakia
near the Turkish border.
Many of the "Syrian Turkmen" fighting against the Syrian people are from
Central Asia and part of the terrorist groups of Jabhat al-Nusra, Ansar
Al Shams, Jabhat Ansar Ad Din and Ahrar al Shams. Uighurs smuggled in
from China and fighting under the "Turkistan Islamist Party" label even
advertise their ‘little jihadists’ children training camps in the area.
The few real Syrian Turkmen work, as even the BBC admits, together with
al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups. Their leader and spokesman, one
Alparslan Celik, is a Turkish citizen from Elazığ.
The Turkish claim of defending "Turkmen" in Syria is a sham. It is
defending mostly foreign Islamist terrorists.
Whoever planned the ambush on the Russian jet miscalculated the
reaction. NATO will not come to Turkey's help over this or the next such
incident. NATO countries know that the Russian plane was hit within
Syria. Russia will not be scared into drawing back. Instead it massively
increased the bombing of targets in that area:
    At least 12 air strikes hit Latakia's northern countryside as
pro-government forces clashed with fighters from al Qaeda's Nusra Front
and Turkmen insurgents in the Jabal Akrad and Jabal Turkman areas, the
British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
    A Turkmen commander said missiles fired from Russian warships in the
Mediterranean were also hitting the area, as well as heavy artillery
Russian jets also bombed insurgency supply trucks (video) in al-Qaeda
controlled Azaz, north of Aleppo and just some two kilometers from the
Turkish border. They also bombed the Bab al-Hawa border crossing to
Turkey. That is a big FU to Erdogan.
The Russian missile cruiser Moskva with its extensive air defense
systems is now covering the area. Russia will officially deploy two
S-400 air defense systems to cover all of north-west Syria and southern
Turkey. Russia also has lots of electronic wizardry it can (and will)
apply. The preparation of additional airfields is ongoing. There will be
no outward military revenge against Turkey unless it crosses into Syria.
The "safe zone" within Syria Erdogan dreams of would have to be won by
defeating Russian forces.
The 4.5 million Russian tourists who visited Turkey this year will not
come again. Turkish business in Russia, mostly in the building industry
and agricultural products, will shrink to nearly zero. That the scheming
to take down a Russian air plane may have negative consequences for
Turkey suddenly also dawned to Davutoğlu who now pretends that we wants
to make nice again:
    Turkey is not aiming to escalate tension with Russia, Turkish Prime
Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu said Nov. 25, echoing President Recep Tayyip
Erdoğan following the downing of a SU-24 Russian jet the previous day.
    “Russia is our friend and neighbor. Our bilateral communication
channels are open. But our security, as for every friendly country,
should be based on the principle of respect under international law.
It’s normal to protect our national airspace,” Davutoğlu said,
addressing party members in parliament.
And it is normal for Russia to defend its ally Syria. Against all
enemies. By all means.
But back to Turkey's motive. The way this is played one might believe
that this was a indeed a lonely Turkish idea to defend its immediate
interests in Syria - the "Turkmen" as well as the oil business Erdogan's
son has with the Islamic State.
But there is also a bigger game going on and it is likely that Erdogan
has a new contract and Obama's backing for this escalation. James
Winnefeld, the deputy chief of General Staff of the U.S. military, was
in Ankara when the incident happened. The cooperation between U.S. and
Turkish military and especially the air forces is quite tight. It is
hard to believe that there was no communication about what was prepared
to happen.
After the Islamic State attack in France President Hollande attempted to
create a global coalition against IS which would include Russia and Iran
as well as the U.S. led anti-ISIS block. But such a coalition, which
makes a lot of sense, would have to agree to leave Syria alone and to
help Syrian ground forces to effectively fight the Islamic State. It
does not make sense to destroy the Syrian state and to just hope that
the outcome would be something better than an emboldened IS or AlQaeda
ruling in Damascus. That outcome is certainly not in Europe's interest.
But a global coalition is not in U.S. or Turkish interests. It would end
their common plans and efforts to overthrow the Syrian government and to
install a "Sunni" state in Syria and Iraq as a Turkish protectorate.
The Russian jet incident decreased the likelihood of such a coalition.
Holland, visiting Washington yesterday, had to pull back with his plan
and was again degraded to parrot Obama's "Assad must go" nonsense. Obama
feels emboldened and now pushes to widen the conflict in Syria:
    The Obama administration is using the current moment of extreme
anger and anxiety in Europe to press allies for sharp increases in their
contributions to the fight against the Islamic State. Suggestions
include more strike aircraft, more intelligence-sharing, more training
and equipment for local fighters, and deployment of their own special
operations ­forces.
    ...
    While new contributions would be added to anti-Islamic State
campaigns across the board, the attention is clearly on Syria, marking a
shift in what began as an “Iraq first” focus when Obama authorized
airstrikes in the region last fall.
    ...
    Obama, speaking beside Hollande on Tuesday, restated his insistence
that Assad is part of the problem, not the solution, and that he must go.
The Obama administration is also preparing to install the Turkish dream
of a "safe zone" between Aleppo and the Turkish border north of it.
    Among several coalition priorities in Syria, the United States has
begun a series of airstrikes in an area known as the “Mar’a line,” named
for a town north of Aleppo in the northwest. There, a 60-mile stretch to
the Euphrates River in the east is the only remaining part of the
Syria-Turkey border under Islamic State control.
    The administration had delayed beginning operations in the area
because U.S. aircraft were needed in operations farther east, and it has
been uncertain that local opposition forces­ would be able to hold the
territory if it could be cleared with airstrikes.
The increased Russian air defense and the likely increase of its
deployed planes will make those "safe zone" plans impossible.
But Obama, in my conclusion, still wants to drag NATO into Syria and
wants to assemble enough forces "against ISIS" to be able to overwhelm
the Syrian government and its Russian protectors. If that does not work
he at least hopes to give Russia the Afghanistan like "quagmire" in
Syria he and other U.S. officials promised. The again increasing
tensions with U.S. proxy Ukraine only help in that regard.
But there is even more to that plan. Just by chance (not) the NYT op-ed
pages launch a trial balloon today for the creation of a Sunni state in
east Syria and west Iraq. But that (Islamic) State is already there and
the "containment" strategy Obama practices towards it guarantees that it
will fester.
Obama continues his immensely destructive policies in the Middle East
with zero regard to the all the bad outcomes these are likely to have
for the people there as well as for Europe. One again wonders if all
these action follow from sheer incompetence or from some devilish,
ingenious strategic planning.

Thought I'd throw this out there...

The Shadows in the Cave
I had intended this week’s post to be the next episode in the Retrotopia
narrative, chronicling Peter Carr’s meeting with the irrepressible Col.
Tom Pappas of the Lakeland Republic Army, and the trip out to Defiance
County for the annual drone shoot, but that will have to wait another
week. No, I haven’t decided to comment instead on the recent spate of
terror attacks in France.  As people in a variety of other corners of
the world have pointed out, identical outrages happen all over the Third
World every few days.  The only reason this latest horror has gotten so
much air time is that it affected people in one of the world’s
privileged countries instead.
Nor am I going to be devoting this week’s post to the latest, extremely
troubling round of news from the climate change front—though that’s
going to get a post to itself down the road a bit, when I’ve had time to
do a little more research. That’s a far bigger story than the terror
attacks in Paris, though of course it’s not getting anything like as
much attention in the media.  From the beginning of serious salt water
infiltration into South Florida’s aquifers, through ominously bulging
sediments in Arctic Ocean shallows, to an assortment of truly
frightening data points from Greenland, it’s clear that we’ve passed the
threshold from “something may happen someday” to “something is happening
now”—a transition that probably has quite a bit to do with the
increasingly shrill tone of climate-change denialist rhetoric just now,
and even more to do with the increasingly plaintive tone of those
activists who still insist that everything can be fixed if we all just
join hands and sing “Kum ba ya” one more time.
No, this week’s post is going to explore a topic that’s far less
important in the overall scheme of things, though it’s not without its
relevance to the crisis of our age. I want to talk about the reaction I
fielded in response to last week’s post here on The Archdruid Report,
which was an exploration of our culture’s taboo against choosing not to
use the latest technologies.
I expected that post to field its share of outraged denunciations, and
it certainly did. What I didn’t expect was that it would receive more
comments than any other post in the history of The Archdruid Report, and
the vast majority of those comments would agree heartily with the two
points of that post. The first of these points is that there’s a
significant number of Americans out there who, for one good reason or
another, choose not to use cell phones, televisions, automobiles,
microwave ovens, and an assortment of other currently fashionable
technologies. The second is that there’s an even larger number of
Americans out there who get really, really freaky about people who make
such choices.
Some of the stories I heard from readers of my blog were absolute
classics of the type. There was the couple who don’t enjoy television
and so don’t own one, and had a relative ask them every single year,
over and over again, if she could buy them a television for Christmas. They said no thank you every single year, and finally she went out and
bought them a television anyway because she just couldn’t stand the
thought that they weren’t watching one. There was the coworker who
plopped a laptop playing some sitcom or other right down on the lap of
one of my readers and demanded that the reader watch it, right then and
there, so that they would have something to talk about. There was the
person who, offended by another reader’s lack of interest in television,
finally shouted, “You must be living in a dream world!” Er, which of
these people was spending four to six hours a day watching paid actors
playing imaginary characters act out fictional events in contrived settings?
Televisions were far from the only focus of this sort of technobullying.
Other readers reported getting similar reactions from other people
because they didn’t happen to have, and weren’t interested in having,
microwave ovens, smartphones, and so on down the list of currently
fashionable trinkets. The stories are really quite eye-opening, and not
in a good way. Forget about all the popular cant that insists that
you’re free in the USA to make your own choices and have whatever
lifestyle you want.  According to a significant fraction of
Americans—and to judge from what my readers reported, that fraction
isn’t limited to any one class, income level, or region of the
country—the only freedom you’re supposed to exercise, when it comes to
technology, is that of choosing which brand label will be slapped on
each item in the officially approved list of devices you’re expected to own.
The prevalence of technobullying and technoshaming in today’s America is
a fascinating point, and one we’ll explore in a few moments, with the
able assistance of the denunciations flung at last week’s post by the
minority of readers who reacted that way. What I want to consider first
is the fact that so many people responded to last week’s post so
positively. One blog in an uncrowded corner of the internet, written by
an author whose day job as an archdruid locates him squarely on the
outer fringes of contemporary American life, is very nearly the opposite
of a statistically valid poll. Still, the sheer volume of the response
makes me suspect that something significant is going on here.
By that I don’t mean that there’s some sort of groundswell of
renunciation, leading people to walk away from technologies in the same
spirit that led medieval ascetics to don hair shirts and flog themselves
for the good of their souls. That’s one of the common stereotypes
directed at those of us who aren’t interested in the latest technotrash,
and it completely misses what’s actually going on. I’ll use myself as an
example here. I don’t own a television—I haven’t owned one in my adult
life—and it’s not because I have some moral or political objection to
televisions, or because I’m into self-denial, or what have you. I don’t
own a television because I find watching television about as enticing as
eating a bowl of warm snot.
It’s not the programming, either—that’s another of the standard
stereotypes, that the only thing one can find objectionable about
television is the programming, and it’s as inaccurate as the rest.  To
me, quite simply, the activity of watching little colored shapes jerk
around on a screen is boring and irritating, not relaxing and enjoyable,
no matter what the little colored shapes are supposed to be doing. Yes,
I grew up with a television in the house.  I experienced plenty of it
back in the day, and I have zero interest in experiencing any more,
because I don’t like it. It really is that simple. It’s that simple for
others as well: they don’t find this or that technology enjoyable,
useful, or relevant to their lifestyles, and so they’ve chosen to do
something else with their money and time. Shouldn’t so simple and
personal a choice be their own business, and nobody else’s?
To judge by the reactions that those who make such choices routinely
field, apparently not. The pushbacks discussed in the comments page last
week range from the sort of in-your-face confrontations discussed above
to a much-forwarded article in I forget which online rag, where somebody
was airily announcing that he wasn’t interested in being friends with
somebody unless he could text some vacuous comment about lunch to the
other person at 2:15 and get a response by 2:30. (My readers and I are
good with that—somebody who insists on getting immediate feedback for
their random outbursts of mental flatulence isn’t somebody we want as a
friend, either.) Then there were the indignant responses to last week’s
post, which belong in a category by themselves.
I’m sorry to say that my favorite diatribe didn’t show up in the comment
queue for The Archdruid Report. It appeared instead on one of the many
other websites that carry my weekly posts, and it insisted, among
several other less juicy bits, that my lack of enthusiasm for television
obviously meant that I was conspiring to deprive everyone else of their
teevees. You’ve got to admit that for sheer giddy delirium, that one’s
hard to beat. By the same logic, if I dislike peanuts—as in fact I do—I
must be committed to some kind of anti-peanut crusade devoted to
eradicating the entire species. Not so;  Arachis hypogaea is welcome to
live and thrive, for all I care, and my fellow hominids are equally
welcome to eat as much of its produce as they happen to desire.  In
fact, they can divide my share among them. The only thing I ask in
return is that nobody expect me to eat the things myself.
The same rule applies equally to television, as it does to a great many
other things. Like most human beings, I enjoy some things and don’t
enjoy others, and in the vast majority of these cases, nobody feels
particularly threatened by the fact that I don’t like something they do,
and avoid it for that sensible reason. For this one commenter, at least,
that obviously wasn’t the case, and it’s worth reflecting on the vast
personal insecurities that must have driven such a bizarre reaction.
Still, that was one of a kind, so we’ll pass on to the others.
A theme that showed up rather more often in the hate mail responding to
last week’s post was the insistence that if I don’t have a television, a
microwave, or a cell phone, I’m a hypocrite if I have an internet
connection. I encourage my readers to think about that claim for a
moment. I suppose a case could be made that if my lack of interest in
having a television, a microwave, or a cell phone was motivated by the
kind of passion for hair-shirt asceticism mentioned above, and I had an
internet connection, I could be accused of the kind of slacking that
used to get you thrown out of the really top-notch hermitages. From any
other perspective, it’s a triumph of absurdity. If people are in fact
allowed to choose, from among the currently available technologies,
those that make them happiest—as the cheerleaders of the consumer
economy delight to insist—what could possibly be wrong with choosing
some old technologies and some newer ones, if that’s the mix you prefer?
Then there are the people whose response to the technology of an older
time is to yammer endlessly about whatever bad things happened in those
days, even when the bad things in question had nothing to do with the
technology and vice versa. People like the couple I discussed in last
week’s post, who prefer Victorian furnishings and clothing to their
modern equivalents, get this sort of bizarre non sequitur all the time,
but variants of it turned up in my inbox last week as well. Here again,
there’s some heavy-duty illogic involved. If a technology that was
invented and used in the 1850s, say, is permanently tarred with the
various social evils of that era, and ought to be rejected because those
evils happened, wouldn’t that also mean that the internet is just as
indelibly tarred with the social evils of the modern era, and ought to
be discarded because bad things are happening in the world today? What’s
sauce for the goose, after all, is sauce for the gander...
Finally, there’s the capstone of the whole edifice of unreason, the
insistence that anybody who doesn’t use the latest, hottest technotrash
wants to go “back to the caves,” or to even take all of humanity to that
much-denounced destination. “The caves” have a bizarre gravitational
effect on the imagination of a certain class of modern thinkers. Everything that’s not part of the latest assortment of glitzy
technogimmicks, in their minds, somehow morphs into the bearskin kilts
and wooden clubs that so many of us still, despite well over a century
of detailed archeological evidence, insist on pushing onto our
prehistoric ancestors.
When people of this kind archly dismiss people like the Chrismans, the
neo-Victorian couple just mentioned, as going “back to the caves,”
they’re engaged in a very interesting kind of absurdity. Do cavemen and
Victorians belong on the same level? Sure, cavemen had flush toilets and
central heating, daily newspapers and public libraries, not to mention
factories, railways, global maritime trade, a telegraph network covering
much of the planet’s land surface, and a great deal more of the same
kind! That’s absurd, of course. It’s even more absurd to insist that
people who simply don’t enjoy using this or that technology, and so
don’t use it, are going back to “the caves”—but I can promise you, dear
reader, from my own personal experience, that if you show a lack of
interest in any piece of fashionable technology, you’ll have this phrase
thrown at you.
That happens because “the caves” aren’t real. They aren’t, for example,
the actual cave-shrines of the Magdalenian people who lived fifteen
thousand years ago, whose lifestyles were quite similar to those of
Native Americans before Columbus, and who used to go deep into the caves
of Europe to paint sacred images that still stun the viewer today by
their beauty and artistry. “The caves” of contemporary rhetoric, rather,
are thoughtstopping abstractions, bits of verbal noise that people have
been taught to use so they don’t ask inconvenient questions about where
this thing called “progress” is taking us and whether any sane person
would actually want to go there. Flattening out the entire complex
richness of the human past into a single cardboard bogeyman labeled “the
caves” is one way to do that.  So is papering over the distinctly ugly
future we’re making for ourselves with a screen shot or two from a
Jetsons cartoon and a gaudy banner saying “We’re headed for the stars!”
It’s really rather fascinating, all things considered, that the image of
the cave should have been picked up for that dubious purpose. Not that
long ago, most literate people in the Western world tended to have a
very different image come to mind when someone mentioned caves. That was
courtesy of a man named Aristocles of Athens, who lived a little more
than 2300 years ago and whose very broad shoulders got him the nickname
Plato. In the longest, most influential, and most problematic of his
works, usually called The Republic—a bad choice, as this word nowadays
has connotations of rights under law that the Greek title Politeia
lacks—he framed his discussion of the gap between perception and reality
with an arresting image.
Imagine, Plato says, that we are all shackled in a cave, unable to turn
our heads to either side. All we can see are dark shapes that move this
way and that on the flat wall of the cave in front of us. Those dark
shapes are all we know.  They are our reality.
Now imagine that one of these prisoners manages to get loose from his
shackles, and turns away from the cave wall and the dark shapes on it.
He’s in for a shock, because what he sees when he turns around is a
bonfire, and people moving objects in front of the flames so that the
objects cast shadows on the cave wall. Everything he thought was reality
is simply a shadow cast by these moving objects.
If the prisoner who’s gotten loose pays attention, furthermore, he might
just notice that the cave isn’t limited to the bonfire, the prisoners,
the objects casting the shadows and the people who manipulate those
objects. Off past the bonfire, on one side of the cave, the floor slopes
upwards, and in the distance is a faint light that doesn’t seem to come
from the fire at all. If our escaped prisoner is brave enough, he might
decide to go investigate that light. As he does so, the bonfire and the
shadows slip into the darkness behind him, and the light ahead grows
brighter and clearer.
Then, if he’s brave enough and keeps going, he steps out of the cave and
into the sunlight. That’s not an easy thing, either, because the light
is so much more intense than the dim red glow in the cave that for a
while, he can’t see a thing. He stumbles, rubs his eyes, tries to find
his bearings, and discovers that the detailed knowledge he had of the
way shadows moved on the cave wall won’t help him at all in this new,
blazingly bright realm. He has to discard everything he thinks he knows,
and learn the rules of an unfamiliar world.
Bit by bit, though, he accomplishes this. His eyes adapt to the
sunlight, he learns to recognize objects and to sense things—color, for
example, and depth—which didn’t exist in the shadow-world he thought he
inhabited when he was still a prisoner in the cave. Eventually he can
even see the sun, and know where the light that illumines the real world
actually comes from.
Now, Plato says, imagine that he decides to go back into the cave to
tell the remaining prisoners what he’s seen. To begin with, it’s going
to be rough going, because his eyes have adapted to the brilliant
daylight and so he’s going to trip and stumble on the way down. Once he
gets there, anything he says to the prisoners is going to be dismissed
as the most consummate rubbish:  what is this nonsense about color and
depth, and a big bright glowing thing that crosses something called the
sky? What’s more, the people to whom he’s addressing his words are going
to misunderstand them, thinking that they’re about the shadow-world in
front of their eyes—after all, that’s the only reality they know—and
they’re going to decide that he must be an idiot because nothing he says
has anything to do with the shadow-world.
Plato didn’t mention that the prisoners might respond by trying to drag
the escapee back into line with them and bully him into putting his
shackles back on, though that’s generally the way such things work out
in practice. Plato also never saw a television, which is unfortunate in
a way—if he had, he could have skipped the complicated setup with the
bonfire and the people waving around objects that cast shadows, and
simply said, “Imagine that we’re all watching television in a dark room.”
Now of course Plato had his own reasons for using the cave metaphor, and
developed it in directions that aren’t relevant to this week’s post. The
point I want to make here is that every technology is a filter that
shapes the way we experience and interact with the world. In some cases,
such as television, the filtering effect is so drastic it’s hard not to
see—unless, that is, you don’t want to see it.  In other cases, it’s
subtle. There are valid reasons people might want to use one filter
rather than another, or to set aside an assortment of filters in order
to get a clearer view of some part of the world or their lives.
There are also, as already noted, matters of personal choice. Some of us
prefer sun and wind and depth and color to the play of shadows on the
walls of the cave. That doesn’t mean that we’re going to drag those who
don’t share that preference out into the blinding light, or that we’re
going to turn ourselves into the Throg the Cave Man shadow that’s being
waved around so enthusiastically on one corner of the cave wall. It does
mean—or so the response to last week’s post suggests—that a significant
number of people are losing interest in the shadow-play and clambering
up the awkward but rewarding journey into the sunlight and the clean
cool air, and it may just mean as well that those who try to bully them
into staying put and staring at shadows may have less success than they
On an entirely personal note, I’m pleased to report that Founders House
Publishing has just brought out a new edition of my first science
fiction novel, The Fires of Shalsha. It’s closer to mainstream SF than
anything else I’ve written—it’s even set on another planet—but fans of
my subsequent novels, Star’s Reach and Twilight’s Last Gleaming, will
find it an enjoyable read. Copies can be ordered here.

Embedded devices of some 50 manufacturers has been found sharing the
same hard-coded X.509 certificates (for HTTPS) and SSH host keys, a fact
that can be exploited by a remote, unauthenticated attacker to carry out
impersonation, man-in-the-middle, or passive decryption attacks
SEC Consult has analyzed firmware images of more than 4000 embedded
devices of over 70 vendors — firmware of routers, IP cameras, VoIP
phones, modems, etc. — and found that, in some cases, there are nearly
half a million devices on the web using the same certificate.

Vladimir Putin could really give a flying fuck who one fucks. No one in
Russia really does, and making table conversation out of one's sexual
preferences is a uniquely 'Merican phenome. Last week some guy at my

the TG was a whole new... Get the picture? TMI! I couldn't shut the guy
up until I literally started screaming at him, bringing the verbal
altercation to the attention of a not-amused barista.
Russia is making laws about discussing LGBT, if indeed the law even does
that (can't tell by US reporting of the issue),  because THE ONLY PEOPLE
who would care to do so ... are people with AGENDAS. Ie. George Soros'
color-rev bffs. A while back I read an article about a LGBT nightclub in
St Petersburg that was thrashed by an alleged anti-gay 'wrecking crew'.
The bar owner said, and I quote, "They weren't from around here". Right.

Without regulation you OWN your OWN 'monopoly' in whatever you
accumulate and so does everyone else.
The Hunts cornered the silver market in a REGULATED market, which, for
economic reasons better left to others to explain, cause the price of
silver to decline dramatically and then stabilize and stay at that level
for years .
In a free market they'd just be sitting on a bunch of silver they
couldn't sell and anyone else with silver would go on trading with
others on a more equilateral basis.
Of course I'm making the assumption that really free markets can only
exist in fully decentralized societies that would eschew centralized
trading AND the middlemen necessary for it's operation.

them. People that want to profit over other people need them, but
individuals do not have to cooperate ... until the middlemen conspire
with 'People that want to profit over other people" to hire people with
guns to enforce their markets.

George Soros (for instance), NOT CIA. That's how you get true plausible
The Russians have no person like that. They use their foreign policy
channels. Anyone as wealthy as Soros in Russia (if there is such a
person) is a Kleptocrat and generally want to destroy the Russian
government, not assist it.
Example of what Porter Goss meant:
Right now the US is making claims via the Daily Beast that the Russians
bombed a hospital in al-Nusra/ISIS HQ Idlib Syria.
The US government is making NO CLAIM AT ALL. They're leaving it to the
Western NGO backed hospital's staff and a guy whose CV is:
You know what the "Sons of Iraq program" was rysiek?
It was the publicly announced US attempt in Iraq to get al-Qaeda
affiliated Sunnis to work as militias for the government, paid for by
the US. The 'paymasters' were a little slow so most of them, much like
the ISIS fighters in Idlib, of whom some most likely are those former
'sons', 'defected to al-Qaeda, and the guy mentioned above is a LONG
TERM "Handler" for those folks as propaganda intermediary for the
"Syrian Coalition", western governments, working for a PRIVATE NGO with
no direct affiliation anymore to the CIA or Pentagon.
PS. George Soros is only 4 degrees separated from al-Qaeda.
He funds the "White Helmets" in Syria, the "Free Syrian Army's"
fighter(1) SAR team that OCCASIONALLY rescues a civilian. Those FSA
fighters defect to al-Nusra. 70 just did so and stated that was their
intent from the git (2). al-Nusra swears allegiance to ISIS (3), and
ISIS was formerly known as al-Qaeda in Iraq.(4)
All the above has happened without one US dollar going through
government channels (except the publicly known funding to train the
defecting fighters).

Unless it was something indispensable, they'd be sitting on something
worthless. That's why, until the industrial age, almost all wars were
over WATER rights., Not extractive resource rights (currently thinking
of DRC, pretty much the sole source for the tantalum for your
smartphone's touchy-feelie screen and micro-capacitors)
By extension, cornering the market in silver, or tantalum, or any
industrially-used extractive resource brings the industrial age one step
closer to extinction (snigger...)
Before nation-states and city states it was most likely THE way of life
for humans ... Until the industrial revolution it still existed in many
tribal-based hunter-gatherer and agrarian cultures.
Even today the Zapatistas have a slogan that spells out the cultural
"Everything for everyone and nothing for ourselves"
Communities based on getting for oneself so one can 'give' to others is
sickness. In healthy cultures one works for the community so the fruits
of one's labor comes to all who participate.
W. Edward Deming knew that was the way things should work, and so does
every industrialist on the planet. But it doesn't maximize THEIR profit.
Admittedly, like databases, 'scaling' can be a bit of a problem.

The market is, in the instance you used, a microscopic subset of
humanity. The 1 percent or typically less who buy armies and guns. OPEC
could never have existed without US and UK's naval demand for oil after
WWI (because of the higher BTUs available per load than coal) and the
strongmen those governments assisted to power to obtain the oil.
Read the first chapter of "End of Oil" by Paul Roberts. He manages to
give a history of the Middle East from the time the first barrel of oil
was shipped from a Saudi oil terminal in the mid 1910s to the invasion
of Iraq in a very concise manner.
Ps. Norway and Venezuela are also members of OPEC, and are standing by
to shift the internal balance of the organization entirely to the West
if the illiterate "House of Saud" and it's perverted 'princes' are ever
driven from power by internal revolt or the nation destabilized to the
point where control of OPEC could be wrested away from them.

from those depleted fields. It lasts about 50 years past the time the
oil runs out according to oil geologists.

what's left of the Russian Oilfields and their natural gas.

The Cabale News Service audio files I uploaded to IA were available for

I'm not going to make JYA's argument here, even if what's been assumed
is fact, but the strategy would be a stall at least with the potential
for redirection from the 'dead canary' hypothesis because it's typical
for people to explode into useless flame wars over the 'leakage' instead
of giving serious thought beyond ego/profit motives to why the leak
But, as a notable scientist once said... "Yes, but the whole point of

It's not a 'mirror'. So far as I can see, it's a dump. The National
Security Archive maintains a mirror  and you aren't going to find any
dox 'in the wild' or modified, or even SUSPECTED of being modified dox
on that reflector.
it is exceptionally difficult, short of ordering physical duplicates,
to obtain a significant portion of cryptome archive from cryptome.org.
part of this is inherent abuse - any mirror gets serious algorithmic
beatings - akin to HackingTeam mirrors perhaps, not counting the
mindless cloud VM bot walkers, annoying enough.  even the hidden
service only mirrors got offensive proddings. remember, some of
cryptome-opponents are relying on obscurity - thwarted every time some
makes a mirror...

There were no "Purges" in Vietnam.
If you read ANY account of those alleged purges carefully what you'll
discover is the article title says so, and the first paragraph says so,
then the rest of the information is about the Laotian and Cambodian
purges, which could have only happened with America's assistance in
bringing (this will sound familiar) warlords who were willing to collude
with the US to power in those countries.
Don't drink the koolaid about the Vietnam War, and NEVER believe an
alleged 'pacifist'. They DEPEND on you believing lies like "Vietnam -
Purges" to continue the rationalizations that the US has EVER fought a
'righteous' international war. The pacifist need that belief as well, to
to rationalize what was typically utterly ineffective action, if they
ever really did anything at all, as the slaughter continued unabated for
a decade or more.
The US government is going to spend millions of dollars over the next
decade to reinforce those myths too.

@_subject: The Economist checks in on "The promise of the blockchain" 
The Economist
The promise of the blockchain
The trust machine
The technology behind bitcoin could transform how the economy works
Oct 31st 2015 | From the print edition
BITCOIN has a bad reputation. The decentralised digital cryptocurrency,
powered by a vast computer network, is notorious for the wild
fluctuations in its value, the zeal of its supporters and its degenerate
uses, such as extortion, buying drugs and hiring hitmen in the online
bazaars of the “dark net”.
This is unfair. The value of a bitcoin has been pretty stable, at around
$250, for most of this year. Among regulators and financial
institutions, scepticism has given way to enthusiasm (the European Union
recently recognised it as a currency). But most unfair of all is that
bitcoin’s shady image causes people to overlook the extraordinary
potential of the “blockchain”, the technology that underpins it. This
innovation carries a significance stretching far beyond cryptocurrency.
The blockchain lets people who have no particular confidence in each
other collaborate without having to go through a neutral central
authority. Simply put, it is a machine for creating trust.
The blockchain food chain
To understand the power of blockchain systems, and the things they can
do, it is important to distinguish between three things that are
commonly muddled up, namely the bitcoin currency, the specific
blockchain that underpins it and the idea of blockchains in general. A
helpful analogy is with Napster, the pioneering but illegal
“peer-to-peer” file-sharing service that went on line in 1999, providing
free access to millions of music tracks. Napster itself was swiftly shut
down, but it inspired a host of other peer-to-peer services. Many of
these were also used for pirating music and films. Yet despite its
dubious origins, peer-to-peer technology found legitimate uses, powering
internet startups such as Skype (for telephony) and Spotify (for music
streaming)—and also, as it happens, bitcoin.
The blockchain is an even more potent technology. In essence it is a
shared, trusted, public ledger that everyone can inspect, but which no
single user controls. The participants in a blockchain system
collectively keep the ledger up to date: it can be amended only
according to strict rules and by general agreement. Bitcoin’s blockchain
ledger prevents double-spending and keeps track of transactions
continuously. It is what makes possible a currency without a central bank.
Blockchains are also the latest example of the unexpected fruits of
cryptography. Mathematical scrambling is used to boil down an original
piece of information into a code, known as a hash. Any attempt to tamper
with any part of the blockchain is apparent immediately—because the new
hash will not match the old ones. In this way a science that keeps
information secret (vital for encrypting messages and online shopping
and banking) is, paradoxically, also a tool for open dealing.
Bitcoin itself may never be more than a curiosity. However blockchains
have a host of other uses because they meet the need for a trustworthy
record, something vital for transactions of every sort. Dozens of
startups now hope to capitalise on the blockchain technology, either by
doing clever things with the bitcoin blockchain or by creating new
blockchains of their own (see article).
One idea, for example, is to make cheap, tamper-proof public
databases—land registries, say, (Honduras and Greece are interested); or
registers of the ownership of luxury goods or works of art. Documents
can be notarised by embedding information about them into a public
blockchain—and you will no longer need a notary to vouch for them.
Financial-services firms are contemplating using blockchains as a record
of who owns what instead of having a series of internal ledgers. A
trusted private ledger removes the need for reconciling each transaction
with a counterparty, it is fast and it minimises errors. Santander
reckons that it could save banks up to $20 billion a year by 2022.
Twenty-five banks have just joined a blockchain startup, called R3 CEV,
to develop common standards, and NASDAQ is about to start using the
technology to record trading in securities of private companies.
These new blockchains need not work in exactly the way that bitcoin’s
does. Many of them could tweak its model by, for example, finding
alternatives to its energy-intensive “mining” process, which pays
participants newly minted bitcoins in return for providing the computing
power needed to maintain the ledger. A group of vetted participants
within an industry might instead agree to join a private blockchain,
say, that needs less security. Blockchains can also implement business
rules, such as transactions that take place only if two or more parties
endorse them, or if another transaction has been completed first. As
with Napster and peer-to-peer technology, a clever idea is being
modified and improved. In the process, it is fast throwing off its
reputation for shadiness.
New chains on the block
The spread of blockchains is bad for anyone in the “trust business”—the
centralised institutions and bureaucracies, such as banks, clearing
houses and government authorities that are deemed sufficiently
trustworthy to handle transactions. Even as some banks and governments
explore the use of this new technology, others will surely fight it. But
given the decline in trust in governments and banks in recent years, a
way to create more scrutiny and transparency could be no bad thing.
Drawing up regulations for blockchains at this early stage would be a
mistake: the history of peer-to-peer technology suggests that it is
likely to be several years before the technology’s full potential
becomes clear. In the meantime regulators should stay their hands, or
find ways to accommodate new approaches within existing frameworks,
rather than risk stifling a fast-evolving idea with overly prescriptive
The notion of shared public ledgers may not sound revolutionary or sexy.
Neither did double-entry book-keeping or joint-stock companies. Yet,
like them, the blockchain is an apparently mundane process that has the
potential to transform how people and businesses co-operate. Bitcoin
fanatics are enthralled by the libertarian ideal of a pure, digital
currency beyond the reach of any central bank. The real innovation is
not the digital coins themselves, but the trust machine that mints
them—and which promises much more besides.

Entirely agree. Rand cherry-picked Smith to fit the American
narcissistic dream. Smith didn't idealize that pin factory either. Nor
did Marx in any way support "Marxists". He denounced them on his death
bed, and Lenin, in the process of being poisoned by his Stalin-appointed
nurse said his legacy belonged to Trotsky, NOT Stalin. Lenin wasn't fond
of murderous anti-Semites.

alternative personas just as fucked up as their pre-existing one. That
IS the lesson from role-playing. If you can't get your 'first life'

I've had thoughts about letting all the people who think escape from the

of us who remain can live in peace repairing the damage ...

VICE News Battles Canadian Police Over Right to Protect Journalist's
By Patrick McGuire
October 30, 2015 | 7:00 am
VICE News is fighting an attempt by the RCMP — Canada's federal police
force — to obtain "any notes and all records of communications" between
VICE News reporter, Ben Makuch, and former Calgary
resident-turned-Islamic State (IS) militant, Farah Mohamed Shirdon.
In February of this year, the RCMP entered VICE Media's offices in both
Toronto and Montreal and served Vice Media and Makuch with a production
order. In Canada, a production order is similar to a search warrant.
Up until this week, VICE News was prohibited from reporting on the
RCMP's production order due to a court-ordered sealing order. VICE is
contesting the production and sealing orders in court, on the principles
of protecting any and all sources, protecting freedom of the press, and
to avoid the situation wherein the Canadian news media becomes a
veritable investigative arm of the law.
Makuch has been a full-time journalist at VICE since 2014 and was a
contributor dating back to 2012. He has exclusively reported on the
Canadian military's collaboration with Academi (formerly known as
Blackwater), the rise of the Canadian arms trade, and has closely
followed the activities of known IS militants online. Prior to VICE, he
worked at The Canadian Press.
Makuch's ongoing reporting around IS militants led him to notice a
suspected Canadian member of the IS who was particularly active online:
Farah Mohamed Shirdon.
Makuch was able to contact Shirdon, under one of his online aliases,
through Twitter and KIK Messenger — an instant messaging platform for
smartphones with over 14 million users. Through Makuch's exchanges with
Shirdon, VICE was one of the first organizations in the world to
communicate directly with IS via social media. This provided an
unprecedented view into the intentions and motivations of IS members.
Makuch wrote two articles for VICE based on his communications with
Shirdon, which led to the production order.
In October of last year, just before the tragic Parliament Hill shooting
in Ottawa, Shirdon told Makuch: "Canadians at home shall face the brunt
of the retaliation. If you are in this crusader alliance against Islam
and Muslims you shall see your streets filled with blood Inshaa Allah."
Makuch's reporting on Shirdon also led VICE CEO and founder Shane Smith
to conduct an exclusive Skype interview with Shirdon himself. That
interview was incendiary enough to cause the RCMP to charge Shirdon with
the "commission of an indictable offence for a terrorist group" after
Shirdon warned of an Islamic State attack in New York City.
In conversation with Smith in September 2014, Shirdon claimed "a lot of
brothers" are in New York City "mobilizing right now."
The RCMP has charged Shirdon with five other terrorism-related offenses
in absentia. He is believed to still be living among IS.
"VICE's treatment by the RCMP is completely reprehensible," said Tom
Henheffer, executive director of Canadian Journalists for Free
Expression. "Journalists are not lackies for the police and to use us
that way is a totally unjustifiable violation of free expression and
privacy rights. Going further and slapping a journalism outlet with a
months-long gag order is even more absurd. This is not an effective way
to fight terrorism, this is not how institutions in a free and
democratic society are supposed to behave, and this sets a dangerous
precedent for the free press in Canada that must not be repeated."
VICE News will be in court on Jan. 11 to argue its case against the
Crown, which is representing the RCMP in this matter.
Patrick McGuire is the Head of Content for VICE Canada and a member of
Canadian Journalists for Free Expression.

I'd rather be looking at Pentagon logs for US SOGs in Syria. The
sovereign Syrian government is battling a disinformation blitz. Claims
that Russians are bombing hospitals ... without a speck of proof, to
distract from the proven bombing of an MSF hospital by US forces that
KNEW it was a hospital, for example.
The intertubz is very MUCH a part of that war, and since I side with the
Syrian government, if only because the other option looks A LOT like
what NATO did to Libya, and since the only viable avenues Syria has to
prevent the US and other hostile forces from using it's communications
infrastructure as a weapon against it by CIA mercenaries from Chechnya,
Turkey at el, and their western based disinformation operators, would be
destruction of their civilian telecom system, or spy on that system just
like every other fucking country in the world does, with the US leading
the surveillance parade, I have no problem whatsoever with the Syrian
government keeping logs.
Everyone else does. EVERYONE.

@_subject: Four things to know about presidential hopeful John McAfee 
The Hill say he's a nutjob. I concur. Ate too many DMT-ridden plants or
lizards somewhere .
"Security software pioneer and newly minted presidential candidate John
McAfee has led an unusual life, to put it mildly.
He’s played Russian roulette in front of a reporter to prove a point,
was once a fugitive from the law in Belize and, just last month, was
arrested for an alleged gun violation and driving under the influence.
In keeping with his unconventional style, McAfee’s bid for the White
House, announced this week, will be waged a candidate from his own
“Cyber Party.”
"I have a huge underground following on the web," McAfee told CNN Money.
"I promise you I will win because I have the votes."
On the same day he announced he was running for president, TV network
Spike announced they were planning to air a series next year that “will
be centered around McAfee's first-person interviews and will reveal
unanswered questions about his life ranging from drug-fueled college
days in Virginia, to learning to battle computer viruses early in his
career at Lockheed in the 1980's, to starting McAfee and Associates in
1987, to the 2012 murder investigation in Belize.”
Here are four know about McAfee as he reenters the national spotlight.
He built fortune on antivirus software, then lost it
McAfee made his millions at the anti-virus company that bore his name.
He ultimately cashed out, selling his stake in the firm after taking it
But his fortune took a hit during the 2008 recession. He was worth about
$100 million before the financial crisis, and less than $10 million
after. He said that his losses were exacerbated because much of his
money was tied up in real estate.
“My father always said, 'Real estate, you can't lose in real estate' ...
you know, oddly enough you can,” he told ABC News at the time.
He sold many of his assets, including houses in Hawaii, Colorado and New
Mexico and moved to Belize to develop “natural” antibiotics.
McAfee Associates, the company he founded, was bought by Intel in 2010.
They dropped his name from the brand in 2014.
The Russian roulette story
While McAfee was in Belize, a Wired magazine writer visited his compound
to report a profile. McAfee pulled out a gun during a conversation with
the writer about the Belizean authorities’ interest in his activities.
McAfee put one bullet in the chamber and placed the gun to his head,
according to the profile. “Maybe what happened didn’t actually happen.
Can I do a demonstration?” he asked the writer, who wrote that he tried
to deescalate the situation.
McAfee pulled the trigger repeatedly. Nothing happened.
“I can do this all day long. I can do this a thousand times. Ten
thousand times. Nothing will ever happen,” he said. “Why? Because you
have missed something. You are operating on an assumption about reality
that is wrong.”
The fugitive
In 2012, authorities in Belize investigating the murder of McAfee’s
neighbor, Gregory Faull, were looking to speak with McAfee. He and the
man had had disputes over McAfee’s dogs and the security guards that
watched his property. McAfee told authorities that his dogs had been
poisoned two days before Faull died.
McAfee maintained his innocence and fled the authorities. He said he
thought he would not get a fair hearing in the country. “Things do not
operate here as they do in the States,” he said. “We are living in a
near dictatorship where the legal system is subservient to the cabinet."
His flight from Belize made national headlines and media outlet Vice was
briefly embroiled in a controversy when it appeared as though they had
leaked McAfee’s location accidentally. But after a month on the lam, he
ended up in the capital city of Guatemala.
“I like Guatemala. I think the legal system in Guatemala is superior to
the legal system in Belize," he told CNN at the time. "Guatemala is
close, it is beautiful and most importantly, I enjoy the company of
DUI arrest
After a period of relative quiet, McAfee surfaced again when he was
arrested earlier this year for a gun possession violation and a DUI in
Tennessee. He claimed that while he was impaired, he hadn’t been
drinking alcohol. Instead, he said that a new prescription for Xanax had
impaired his driving.
"Never taken them before,” he told CNBC. “And in fact I was impaired, I
must admit."
He has also been running a company called Future Tense Central. It backs
a range of products and services, one of which is called Autonomous
Armor. The website for the forthcoming product lists several of McAfee’s
accomplishments, before offering a coda.
“Billions of dollars and decades later,” it says. “McAfee is back and at
it again.”

The Cruise Missile Left is cheering all "humanitarian interventions".

I defer to: Amusing Ourselves To Death. Neil Postman.

The last chapter regarding Orwell or Huxley, who was right? clinches it.
(personally, much like General Jack Ripper believed water fluoridation
sapping the essence of our manhood, I think "Turkeyburger" is an
insidious plot to stupefy Mericans with  Soma-like L-Tryptophan. Note
how the media always plays up the benefit of it in re Beef burgers, and
anytime you see the word "Meatxxx" or "Burger minus any reference to
beef or 'ham' in food descriptions, at least some significant portion of
it is L-Tryptophan bearing Turkey product.)

For so many years now the geopolitical 'grand game' has been "Good
Cop/Bad Cop", "Mutt and "Jeff" played on the typically indigenous
people-d extractive resources nations (and in other ways against the
west's manufacturing satraps) by the US AND Russia. Either you pick one
side or the other or we have a war in YOUR country where YOUR people get
killed and your society/way of life destroyed. There are no "nice guys".
On the other hand I bristle when Syria's ally is accused of warmongering
for doing what allies are supposed to do. Come to their defense in the
traditional manner against an army of mercenaries that the West claims
on one hand to be fighting, and on the other, had a large part in it's
Americans just sat idly by with their thumbs up their asses in denial
while the State Dept and CIA created AQv2 from the Libyans we hired to
sodomize Muammar al-Gadaffi with swords, and if the Russians want to
eradicate that threat to Syria and the region, have at it.

I wouldn't trust IT either. If you try logging into Hushmail using Tor
the security question overlay is hosted by... Cloudflare (but not the
rest of Hushmail). Would you suppose CF HAS a vested interest in
stalking Tor for the surveillance state apparatus?
My guess would be that's probably one of their pet surveillance projects.
I understand that a site like fpress undoubtedly needs dDos prevention
services but there has to be some other company providing that sort of
service that isn't connected like a Siamese twin at the wrists and
ankles to the surveillance state.
As a tweet from my account that I don't consider a troll:
I believe NoScript does this as an add-on. It can blacklist cloudflare
but some useful web services such as WeatherUnderground Weather are
badly affected, so fully blocking them limits the utility of the web. Id
say if one only allowed CF for services like that and never showed their
IP to cloudflare otherwise, it wouldn't give them much useful info about
My posts tagged cloudflare
. There's a certain
repetitiveness to the info but this one's a good place to start, with
links to the other related posts >>
BTW, Yasha Levine hooked me up with the CEO of cloudflare on Twitter one
day for a short hostile 'interview' when I questioned Cloudflare's
hosting of BB's Project PM. If you can't stomach weasel words I'd avoid

About your Panama Papers ... Brought to you by US intelligence agencies
with special thank to the "International Consortium of Investigative
Journalists" (ICIJ), which Pepe Escobar notes is funded by the "Center
for Public Integrity"... IOW:
"...the Ford Foundation, Carnegie Endowment, Rockefeller Family Fund,
Kellogg Foundation and the Soros racket"
One of his commenters:
"The  Panama Papers are the exact kind of weaponized Psyops posing as an
'activist leak' I wanted to see from Hybrid Warfare."
    THE ULTIMATE LIMITED HANGOUT LEAK
    Put on your Panama hat and dance the leak.
    And if you believe in the integrity of the "International Consortium
    of Investigative Journalists" (ICIJ), I got a made in Shenzhen
    Panama hat to sell ya.
    I never was, and never will be, a member of this racket; well,
    people asked me, and I'm answering.
    The ICIJ gets its cash and its "organizational procedure" via the
    Exceptionalistan-based Center for Public Integrity. The money comes
    from: Ford Foundation, Carnegie Endowment, Rockefeller Faimly Fund,
    Kellogg Foundation and the Soros racket.
    This alleged most massive leak ever was obtained by - what else - US
    intel.
    But the REAL leak will never be known. Even the uber-pathetic
    Grauniad admitted, on the record, that "much of the leaked material
    will remain private".
    Why? Because it DIRECTLY implicates a gaggle of Western
    0.00000000001% multibillionaires and corporations. All of them play
    the offshore casino game.

Lived in the same Monterey Bay area California town for 40 years. Over
the last ten years or so it's gotten decidedly colder in the winter. It
rarely used to freeze at sea level here (once or twice in a decade or
so) and now it occurs with some regularity... at least three or four
time a year. It also gets warmer. There used to be a couple of 90 degree
days in the summer and the rest more moderate, typically in the upper
60s to upper 70s for most of the season ... Eight years or so ago it
went up to 105f for two days in a row braking every known record. It
gets into the 80s and 90s much more often now. No one has functional air
conditioning here in their homes or cars, and most homes are only
lightly insulated (if at all). Pity the poor commuters stuck in bay area
traffic (not!)

Yuppies hate it when the paint on their bimmer (update: Tesla) gets rock
chipped. As the road got paved, the commuters moved in. Even
Watsonville, after everyone figured out it wasn't much farther to go
over Hecker Pass and up 101. For a while Zayante Road, a tiny winding
two-laner without shoulders out of Felton became a commuter speedway

With this:
    The researchers said they also found evidence that the hackers took
    advantage of a programing interface built into Telegram to identify
    at least 15 million Iranian phone numbers with Telegram accounts
    registered to them, as well as the associated user IDs.
As a redundancy and elaboration of the former quote including
Multisyllabic phrases such as "systematic de-anonymization" to muddle
the issue, and make it appear to be another issue when it isn't.
Apparently all they got are the phone numbers from the sms verification,
and hackers didn't do it. The phoneco GAVE THEM the info. It requires
complicity on the part of the utility. Which is something one can assume
any commercial service would do if a government requests and under THEIR
LAW (Iran in this case) claims criminal activity. The extraction of data
they can do with that phone number It requires that you never set up an
account with password.
A burner smartphone, which by the way US Congress is trying to outlaw,
circumvents. Set up a passworded account using a throwaway email. Done.
Telegram has always cajoled people to set up an account with password
for extra security
Listen, as I've been repeating over an over sometimes directly,
sometimes indirectly ... bad PERSEC/CYBERSEC screws you so much more
often than the communications method or it's potentially compromised
code. Probably 99% of the time but I've never crunched the numbers. NO

I think that's pretty specific about what they want, and broad about the
technology... "circumvention technologies".
If I were managing the project I'd be limiting improvements that would
allow such things and it wouldn't be secret or underhanded (which is why
I never aspired to that sort of position... my underhand toss is lousy),
but unless there's something in the full bill in addition to that, it
doesn't require deprecation of existing code in the product. Because
those things were already paid for and done. It does put the product at
a disadvantage against software meant to undo tor's security in the long
run however, and government excel at doing things that have their effect
in 'the long run'.

tails down. It makes no use of the machine's drive so there's nothing

@_subject: Apple at BlackHat: Reopening the "Going Dark" Debate (Lawfare) 
Just over a week ago, at the BlackHat hacker convention in Las Vegas,
Ivan Krstić, Head of Security Engineering and Architecture at Apple gave
a talk entitled “Behind the scenes of iOS Security,” the slides of which
are available here.
It’s a historic talk for a couple of reasons. First, Apple is
traditionally very secretive about how it technically does security on
its devices. Apple also announced its first bug bounty program. So far,
so newsworthy.
But something else happened at that talk. Unbeknownst to the presenter
or anybody in the audience, Apple just reopened the “Going Dark” dispute
between the FBI and the privacy community, and it turned the entire
dispute on its head. In the cold light of day, I suspect Apple, the US
government, and privacy activists are going to be rather unhappy when
they digest the sobering implications of the talk, though they will
likely be upset for entirely different reasons.
In short, Apple built the very thing that they and the privacy community
have been saying for years is reckless, dangerous or impossible: a
high-value encryption key secured in a vault such that the key can’t be
stolen or misused by hackers or malicious insiders. And without a hint
of self-awareness Apple’s head of security engineering and architecture
went all the way to BlackHat in Las Vegas to boast about how they did it.
But I’m getting ahead of myself. Let’s start at the beginning...

Case in point: The local internet provider here uses AOL upstream, and
one day, while torrenting (transmission, full encryption on) a music
album , my supervisor came in and asked if I was running a torrent

someone bootlegging. She's a sympathetic sort so I say 'yeah' and told

AOL/Time/Warner is apparently sniffing every packet passing through

I just want to remind you the Vietnamese whupped us with WWII vintage
weapons, tiger traps, and pertinently ... sandals made from the tires of
stolen US Jeeps. Tor might be that Jeep.
A 'transparent and independently funded' fork of Tor seems to be
appropriate. To continue the 'war' analogy You don't throw away a weapon
just because it was made by the enemy but you DO check to see if it's
boobytrapped and neutralize it before use.

I THINK Stew Albert might have written a grant proposal, but there were
a couple of others who had the bureaucratic skills to pull it off. I
simply can't find a scanned copy of his first book Revolution for the

If the MPs hadn't kept breaking the circle being created around the

if Ben Morea's UAW/MF shock troop had made it more than a foot or two

Although I have the sneaking suspicion that purple cloud of Pentagon
Evil would have enveloped the Earth like the "Cobalt-Thorium G"
radiation from the Dr. Strangelove "Doomsday Machine", complicating
matters considerably instead. It's good to have the enemy in one place,
instead of scattered everywhere, as seem to be the current strategic

something the tails folks were doing with iptables. Perhaps they're

** Law Enforcement Online: Innovative Doesn’t Mean Illegal (
Judith Germano (
Even the Wild West needed a sheriff. And today’s law enforcement agents, to be effective, need more than a Colt .45 and a gold star. Criminal actors have an increasing ability to commit serious crimes remotely via computers, while concealing their identity and location through the use of various means, including Tor hidden service protocols. To effectively identify and apprehend these criminals, law enforcement must be nimble and technologically savvy, and must employ regularly updated investigative tools. These tools include Network Investigative Techniques (NITs), which enable law enforcement (pursuant to court-authorized warrants) to identify the real IP address of web users, regardless of proxy settings. Some NITs also reveal users’ operating systems, CPU architecture, and session identification, and others (pursuant to a Title III or FISA warrant) can allow real-time, full-system monitoring.
There has been some level of controversy recently regarding the FBI’s use of NITs. But as criminals evolve and become increasingly sophisticated through the use of Tor and encryption techniques, so too must law enforcement’s investigative measures evolve, provided they are employed in accordance with lawful procedures and adequate constitutional safeguards.
It was through a NIT that the FBI, in 2015, was able to successfully take down one of the largest dark web child exploitation sites in the world, to apprehend child predators. The site, disturbingly named “Playpen,” provided thousands of pedophiles ( with images of horrifying sexual abuse of children, as well as guidance on how the molesters could avoid being detected. The Playpen site is reported to have had as many as 215,000 accounts within the first year, and an average of 11,000 unique visitors per week. The FBI, pursuant to a court order ( , seized the web host server in North Carolina and, rather than shutting it down immediately, ran it under FBI control for a limited, two-week period. During that time, the FBI used a NIT, which exploited a security vulnerability in the Tor Browser Bundle, to identify more than 1,300 true IP addresses. More, see link at top.

If you watched IRC In the months before his arrest during various anon

more effective (if I recall correctly I saw that on the scroll during

dDos doesn't work over tor very well, if at all. The IRC bot method
employed by that hacked LOIC program was closer to being functional and
secure... assuming no logs would be kept (and the software wasn't
designed to leak info about the usr), which, as can be seen by "Ryan"'s
dox dump of logs from one of the anon IRC servers, was not the case.
The point is to make it's use pervasive and that makes it expensive to
counter, and you BREAK THEM or at least inhibit their ability to go
after anyone but the highest-of-value targets. That's why I support tor
and promote it. Not because it makes one 'invulnerable, but because the
more people who use it, the more impossible it gets for the authorities
to cope. Telling people not to use it actually helps the feds in more
ways than just 'in the clear' comms, and the gubmint's social engineers
who cut tor down for it's insecurities at places like this list know that.
And getting busted if it doesn't work out?

Or something stoopid like that.
A few years ago when I was still writing news copy for an alt radio news
personality I was personally following the Waxman investigation into
Blackwater. Publicly over the Nisoor Square shooting, but they were
going to cover other issues behind closed doors such as Blackwater's
gun-running  (CPA Glocks w/o serial numbers to Turkish city crime gangs
for a start), which had been followed by McClatchy news service, and I
was using their copy on my blogger posts.
One morning, right before the hearings were about to begin, I was
checking my site counter and discovered a hit from PentagonMil on one of
those posts... What? Me worry?
But what followed next should disturbing to anyone who thought the feds
understood infosec or had someone on payroll who understands.
Apparently the person who viewed it first saved it to their desktop
complete with the site counter jscript, and the next few hits after
that, instead of showing a typical http path, showed the path through

It might fit in the QA end of the biz. Someone has to test security.
Whether your agreement with the company allows them to 'contract' you to
a 3rd party's task... I REALLY doubt it judging from my industrial end
(drive manufacturing) experience. They're really REALLY concerned about
letting any information about the creation of the product out of their
grasp. It probably violates you confidentiality and intellectual
property agreement with the company.
Can the government make you violate that agreement? Can they make Apple
change it's agreement with you? Can the government force you to change a
worker's job description or hire/accept a government contract worker or
Iow, tell you how to run your business...
Dunno. But IF an employee claimed confidentiality and intellectual
property agreement as rationale for non-cooperation... Would the
government also go after that employee? Force Apple to discipline or
fire them?
It's gonna be interesting to see how this goes, but I suspect Apple will
cooperate, in secret b/c FISC/A, and do the government's bidding. If
they really can. We may never find out.
Yes, but those phones didn't have the self-destruct code if I remember
correctly. Apple claims it can't work around it.

It's NOT insubordination if it's NOT your job description. Telling a
coder whose never done anything besides sit at a desk and code they need
to do janitorial tasks for instance.
Telling someone who writes crypto that it's also their job to torture
test it is going to step on the QA director's toes, ya think? If anyone
can be legitimately tasked, it would be the QA department.
It's also dysfunctional to let someone who created the code test it.
That's like letting a machinist who created the part certify it's
Mil-spec 415-D compliance.
Otoh Apple COULD change the job description... IF they want to
re-negotiate the person's salary.
If that person walked I'd speculate there'd be dozens of companies
willing to hire them just because they walked instead of cooperating
with the feds.
The government can't require them to hire anyone.
Further, If the government forces them to add a government paid
contractor or govt employee they could sue for damages caused by
reputation loss with their commercial vendors who buy and sell their
products and material. I'll bet they can easily prove it too! By
charting the DIVE iPhone sales take if they publicly cooperate.
All in all the government demanding a private entity do ANYTHING without
the full force of the law, not JUST some interpretation by the DOJ
backed by some district court hack is a dysfunctional mess that would
tie the government up in court until ios is so fucking obsolete no one
even remembers what it was.
But as I said, as soon as this is out of the news, and Apple has made
enough noise to calm their customers, they'll just do it in secret, as
FISC/A requires. If they can.

Yeah, and where I worked they'd be in double-letter blueprints and the
thing STILL wasn't working. That 'clear communication' turned into
vendors screaming at sales engineers for not delivering, QA got
circumvented or de-fanged/balled/subverted, and, after throwing QA out
the window, they shipped 'whatever worked'.
That didn't work really well for disk drives, and it's a hell of a way
to create secure crypto.
I KNOW the way it works. It doesn't. It's NOT like W. Edward Deming ever
intended, and I'm fucking well sure the people who debug Apple's crypto
know how it works or else Apple would be a remarketer of other company's
designs by now as surely as the hardware company I worked for became a
net consumer of other company's hardware re-packaged under their own
name, or companies purchased and left, as subdivisions, to do it the
right way, under the aegis of their parent.

I still think it's a med reaction exacerbated by his run in with the
SFPD. What I'd really like to have examined is a toxicology report for
Murdock, due to his repeated erratic behavior the SFPD 'intervened' in.
You'd think they'd do such a thing, but I suspect not.
At one point in my younger days I personally knew Abbie Hoffman. Later
in life, and  at the other end of the US I had a hard time believing the
story of his suicide having always noted his maniac side but never
seeing the 'down side' of his personality. I broached that on a list
where someone who knew him a lot better than me posts and he went and
asked Abbie's brother-in-law Wally, from his first marriage to Anita
The response from Wally was an eyeopener. Apparently Abbie was not in
very good health and had about 95% arterial blockage. Then he was
feeling under the weather so the doctors prescribed Prozac for him,
unknowing at the time that the combination of arterial blockage and
prozac causes suicidal thoughts and tendencies.
I suspect something similar happened to Ian Murdock, and the SFPD was
involved, and crudely so, but unless the 'abrasions' to his head that
needed stitches were severe enough to have caused his demise or
exacerbated a pre-existing head injury or unknown such as potential for
cerebral hemorrhage (again, this could be due to prescription meds), it
just another instance of the police as insensitive abusive
bureaucrats-with-guns ham-handly 'dealing' with a citizen, booking and
releasing him.

Plain text and html...
On September 5, 2013, The Guardian
the /New York Times
 /jointly
reported — based on documents provided by whistleblower Edward Snowden —
that the National Security Agency had compromised some of the encryption
that is most commonly used to secure internet transactions. The
encryption, or digital scrambling, that guards global commerce and
banking systems, protects sensitive data like trade secrets and medical
records, and automatically secures the emails, web searches, internet
chats and phone calls of Americans and others around the world.” One
2010 memo described that “for the past decade, NSA has led an
aggressive, multipronged effort to break widely used internet encryption
In support of the reporting, all three papers published redacted
portions of documents from the NSA along with its British counterpart,
GCHQ. Prior to publication of the story, the NSA vehemently argued that
any reporting of any kind on this program would jeopardize national
security by alerting terrorists to the fact that encryption products had
been successfully compromised. After the stories were published, U.S.
officials aggressively attacked
the newspapers for endangering national security and helping terrorists
with these revelations.
All three newspapers reporting this story rejected those arguments prior
to publication and decided to report the encryption-cracking successes.
Then-/NYT/ Executive Editor Jill Abramson described
the decision to publish as “not a particularly anguished one” in light
of the public interest in knowing about this program, and /ProPublica/
editors published a lengthy explanation
 along
with the story justifying their decision.
All three outlets, while reporting the anti-encryption efforts, redacted
portions of the documents they published or described. One redaction in
particular, found in the /NYT /documents
from the FY 2013 “black budget,” proved to be especially controversial
among tech and security experts, as they believed that the specific
identity of compromised encryption standards was being concealed by the
None of the documents in the Snowden archive identify all or even most
of the encryption standards that had been targeted, and there was a
concern that if an attempt were made to identify one or two of them, it
could mislead the public into believing that the others were safe. There
also seemed to be a concern among some editors that any attempt to
identify specific encryption standards would enable terrorists to know
which ones to avoid. One redaction in particular, from the /NYT/, was
designed to strike this balance and was the one that became most
The issue of this specific redaction was raised
 again
 by
security researchers last month
 in the wake of
 of
a backdoor found on Juniper systems, followed by /The Intercept/’s
that the NSA and GCHQ had targeted Juniper. In light of that news, we
examined the documents referenced by those 2013 articles with particular
attention to that controversial redaction, and decided that it was
warranted to un-redact that passage. It reads as follows:
The reference to “the two leading encryption chips” provides some hints,
but no definitive proof, as to which ones were successfully targeted.
Matthew Green, a cryptography expert at Johns Hopkins, declined to
speculate on which companies this might reference. But he said that “the
damage has already been done. From what I’ve heard, many foreign
purchasers have already begun to look at all U.S.-manufactured
encryption technology with a much more skeptical eye as a result of what
the NSA has done. That’s too bad, because I suspect only a minority of
products have been compromised this way.”
NSA requested until 5 p.m. today to respond but then failed to do
so. (/Update/: The NSA subsequently emailed to say: “It would be
accurate to state that NSA declined to comment.”)

References: <568F2E25.9000300
For those too lazy to look it up here's some speculation from
Greenwald's IAMA October 31 2013.
Again, plain text and html:
While I do not know the name redacted in that report, the "VPN and Web
encryption devices" mentioned are most likely hardware SSL acceleration
appliances [1] , and due
to the sensitive nature of the backdoor being discussed, are probably in
chips fabricated by a US-based silicon designer using a US-located
silicon fabrication plant.
The reason for that is twofold; first, you don't want a foreign power
discovering your backdoor in a chip, and second, you don't want a
foreign power inserting their own backdoor.
The vendors [2]
list in Wikipedia lists the following vendors of SSL appliances:
  * Barracuda Networks
  * Array Networks
  * CAI Networks
  * Cavium Networks (fabless semiconductor designer)
  * Cisco Systems
  * Citrix Systems
  * Cotendo
  * Coyote point systems
  * Crescendo Networks
  * Exinda
  * F5 Networks
  * Foundry Networks
  * Forum Systems
  * Freescale Semiconductor (fabless and fab-owning)
  * Hifn
  * IBM (fab-owning)
  * Interface Masters Technologies
  * jetNEXUS
  * Juniper Networks
  * Nortel Networks
  * Radware
  * Riverbed Technology
  * Strangeloop Networks
  * Sun Microsystems
Of those, the two names that stand out most are IBM (which is no
stranger to crippling encryption upon the demands of the NSA, with
fabrication plants throughout the world and the United States, but which
isn't significantly given to florid chip descriptors) and Freescale
Semiconductors - it is itself a large semiconductor fabricator, focused
on semiconductor fabrication, with foundries in Chandler, AZ and Oak
Hill, TX.
One not mentioned in that list is Broadcom, a semiconductor manufacturer
that is /fabless/, that is - it doesn't own any fabrication capability,
itself. It does, however, design a very large percentage of
communications chips used in the industry. Not finding a Broadcom chip
somewhere in a device is notable.
The redacted space is roughly twelve all-caps letters or sixteen
mixed-case letters in that font. If we could have someone identify
exactly which font was used, then we could experiment with chip names
from SSL acceleration device manifests, in that font, and see which fit
into the redacted space, possibly with the manufacturer's name in front
of the chip - for example, the Freescale SAHARA
appears to fit nicely - and is touted as having configurable access
control to the random number generator and hashing functions on that
feature sheet linked - but is just one possibility. Another is the
PowerArchitecture™ from Mocana -formerly FreeScale
[4] .
If I were in the position to lead a project to reverse-engineer the
possible name of the chip, I would:
  * Find out what the top five top-selling SSL acceleration device
    manufacturers in the world are;
  * get a list of their best-selling products;
  * Get parts manifests for each of their popular products, possibly
    from an electronics tear down research organisation;
  * Locate and name the crypto accelerator chips;
  * Determine who designed and fabricated those chips.
  * Get the name of the font used in the report in the imgur link;
  * Compose the name of each of those chips in that font at that pitch;
  * Do a little comparing.
While that is /possible/, it is equally as likely that one variety or
species of chip is being named! i.e. /Intel Pentium chips/. There is
also no guarantee that the redacted text lists a florid,
marketing-friendly name, and may possibly be a code name internal to the
US intelligence community. These and other alternatives should not be

Not JUST FOIAs.
Fixing Pre-Publication Review: What Should Be Done?
By Steven Aftergood
Friday, January 15, 2016 at 9:15 AM
Jack Goldsmith and Oona Hathaway called attention in several recent
columns to the pre-publication review process (here, here, here, and
here) that many current and former national security officials and other
government employees must submit to before their work can be published.
The process, they argued, has become dysfunctional, overstepping
legitimate national security boundaries and infringing on freedom of
speech as well as the public’s right to know.
Their case is strong.
Among many pertinent examples, the experience of former Army Reserve
officer Anthony Shaffer is particularly instructive. After he wrote a
memoir of his Afghan war experience, Shaffer submitted his manuscript to
the Army for review, as required, and the approved text was printed. But
then the Defense Intelligence Agency intervened and objected that in its
estimation the cleared volume still contained classified information.
Publication was halted, and the Department of Defense was obliged to
purchase and pulp thousands of copies of the book, although numerous
publicity copies had already been released. A new version of the book
with the objectionable words and passages blacked out was finally
published for sale. (Shaffer presented his version of events in a First
Amendment lawsuit he brought in 2010, with very limited success.)
What makes the Shaffer case valuable in this context is that both the
pre- and post-publication review versions of his text entered public
circulation, permitting external scrutiny of the deletions required by
the official reviewers. In nearly every case, the redacted words and
passages seem to be devoid of national security sensitivity, as the Army
itself had originally concluded.
The most frequent redaction is the cover name that the author used while
serving in Afghanistan, “Christopher Stryker.” Also commonly deleted are
references to the National Security Agency, its headquarters location in
Fort Meade, Maryland, and the use of the term “SIGINT” (signals
intelligence). Somewhat more plausibly, the identity of the former CIA
chief of station in Kabul was replaced with a pseudonym. But rather less
plausibly, a passing mention of the name of character actor Ned Beatty
was deleted.
The point, in other words, is that there is an empirical foundation for
the belief that pre-publication review has gone off the rails. As it is
conducted today, the review process too often arbitrarily impedes the
freedom of many US government employees to participate in public discourse.

I'd like to think his point is the sociological balance is past the
tipping point, 'crossed the rubicon' so to speak, where it's no longer
possible to repair the society to some globally normal state, or get the
sociopaths out of power, if one thinks a capitalist society can be free
of psychopaths and sociopaths in the first place.
Ps. I'm not anal about sources. ANYONE can feel free to note and analyse
the intrinsic problems of society and have their own solutions which I
don't have to accept.
In other words, punch holes in his premise, not his politics.

Just Security's editor:
This post is the latest installment of our “Monday Reflections” feature,
in which a different Just Security editor examines the big stories from
the previous week or looks ahead to key developments on the horizon.
The end of 2015 brought a flurry of announcements from tech companies,
including Facebook, Yahoo, and Microsoft, promising to notify their
users if the company believes that state-sponsored actors are targeting
the users’ accounts. These state-sponsored-attacker notifications share
features of other kinds of attributions. On the one hand, like the
Mandiant report and other reports by cybersecurity companies
highlighting state-sponsored cyberintrusions, private companies are
responsible for the attribution. On the other hand, like the limited
evidentiary disclosures made by the US government in attributing the
Sony Pictures hack to North Korea, the companies withhold the
evidentiary basis for the notifications in order to protect their
detection methods and avoid tipping off attackers.
The notifications contribute to evolving debates about the requisite
evidentiary basis for attribution of state-sponsored
cyberattacks—debates over types of evidence, amounts of evidence, and
levels of public disclosure that should be required for attribution in
different contexts. The notifications also show that while standards of
evidence for attribution are discussed in multilateral fora like the
United Nations, states are not the only parties whose practice matters.
Company Notifications
Google pioneered notifications to users about state-sponsored attacks in
2012. The company explained in a blog post at the time that in response
to “specific intelligence—either directly from users or from [its] own
monitoring efforts”—it would display a banner stating “Warning: We
believe state-sponsored attackers may be attempting to compromise your
account or computer.”
Facebook made a similar announcement in October 2015. In a blog post by
Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos, Facebook explained that it would
show users a warning if the company has “a strong suspicion that an
attack could be government-sponsored.” According to the New York Times,
in the wake of the Iranian nuclear deal and “[j]ust weeks into the new
[Facebook] alert system,” numerous State Department officials who work
on Iran and the Middle East received notifications that their accounts
had been targeted by a state-sponsored actor.
In mid-December, Twitter, which had not previously announced a policy on
state-sponsored attacks, notified some users that their accounts “may
have been targeted by state-sponsored actors,” who were “trying to
obtain information such as email addresses, IP addresses, and/or phone
numbers.” (A copy a notification sent to another user is available here.)
On December 21, Yahoo Chief Information Security Officer Bob Lord
announced that “Yahoo will now notify you if we strongly suspect that
your account may have been targeted by a state-sponsored actor.”
Microsoft followed suit on December 30, announcing in a blog post by
Corporate Vice President for Trustworthy Computing Scott Charney that
Microsoft “will now notify you if we believe your account has been
targeted or compromised by an individual or group working on behalf of a
nation state.”
According to the companies, they issue notifications for state-sponsored
attackers in particular because, as Facebook explains, “these types of
attacks tend to be more advanced and dangerous than others.” The
notifications are intended to prompt users to better secure their
account with the notifying company and other online accounts by, for
example, enabling two-step verification, changing passwords, and
monitoring for unusual activity.
Similarities to and Differences From Other Attributions to Nation-States
The state-sponsored-attacker notifications share similarities with prior
attributions by both the private sector and the US government. On the
one hand, the notifications (and the attributions supporting them) are
done by private companies, like the reports on state-sponsored
intrusions issued by cybersecurity companies like Mandiant and
Crowdstrike that I discussed in an earlier post.
On the other hand, unlike the extensive technical details that often
accompany such reports (see, for example, the Mandiant APT1 report), the
state-sponsored-attacker notifications do not come with evidence to back
up the attribution. Google’s post on the notifications explains: “You
might ask how we know this activity is state-sponsored. We can’t go into
the details without giving away information that would be helpful to
these bad actors, but our detailed analysis—as well as victim
reports—strongly suggest the involvement of states or groups that are
state-sponsored.” Facebook’s post similarly states, “To protect the
integrity of our methods and processes, we often won’t be able to
explain how we attribute certain attacks to suspected attackers.” The
invocation of secrecy to protect “methods and processes” echoes similar
statements made by the FBI in announcing the attribution of the Sony
Pictures hack to North Korea. The FBI press release explained that the
“need to protect sensitive sources and methods” prevented the Bureau
from sharing details of its evidence against North Korea. The FBI
provided a general description of the evidence supporting the
attribution, including, for example, “significant overlap between the
infrastructure used in this attack and other malicious cyber activity
the U.S. government has previously linked directly to North Korea.” But
the lack of detailed information triggered significant skepticism within
the security community, prompting FBI Director James Comey to release
additional information several weeks later.
Unlike the other types of attribution, the state-sponsored-attacker
notifications do not name the state involved. They simply inform a user
that some “state-sponsored actor” has targeted the user’s account. Of
course, upon receipt of a notification, some users may have a pretty
good idea which state is targeting them, and the pattern of accounts
targeted may reveal the state’s identity to the company or to the public
if/when the notifications become public. That may be what happened with
the Facebook notifications to State Department employees discussed
above. Still, the notifications’ failure to name the particular state
involved renders them somewhat less accusatory than attributions that
name a specific state...

@_subject: Drivers Licenses? We Don' Need No Steekin' Licenses 
*The Decline of the Driver's License*
Julie Beck Jan 22, 2016, The Atlantic
Remember how, in /Clueless, /Alicia Silverstone’s character Cher fails
her driver’s test after nearly killing a biker and scraping her car
alongside several parked cars? And then how she asks, “Do you think I
should write them a note?” as she drives away? And then how, at the
climax of the movie, her friend Tai (Brittany Murphy) calls her “a
virgin who can’t drive ”
and it is just the harshest burn?
Well, that was a fictionalized version of the ‘90s, and this is now.
Things are different.
Young people are not getting driver’s licenses so much anymore. In fact,
no one is. According to a new study
by Michael Sivak and Brandon Schoettle at the University of Michigan
Transportation Research Institute, the percentage of people with a
driver’s license decreased between 2011 and 2014, across all age groups.
For people aged 16 to 44, that percentage has been decreasing steadily since 1983.
It’s especially pronounced for the teens—in 2014, just 24.5 percent of
16-year-olds had a license, a 47-percent decrease from 1983, when 46.2
percent did. And at the tail end of the teen years, 69 percent of
19-year-olds had licenses in 2014, compared to 87.3 percent in 1983, a
21-percent decrease.
Among young adults, the declines are smaller but still significant—16.4
percent fewer 20-to-24-year-olds had licenses in 2014 than in 1983, 11
percent fewer 25-to-29-year-olds, 10.3 percent fewer 30-to-34-year-olds,
and 7.4 percent fewer 35-to-39-year-olds. For people between 40 and 54,
the declines were small, less than 5 percent.
Above 55, the story’s a little different. Older adults were more likely
to have a driver’s license in 2014 than in 1983—in the case of those 70
and older, 43.6 percent more likely. But these age groups, too, saw a
modest decline from 2011 to 2014.
The researchers didn’t look into what the reasons for this decline might
be, but in an earlier study, they surveyed
adults ages 18 to 39 without driver’s licenses about why they don’t have
them. The top three reasons were: “too busy or not enough time to get a
driver’s license” (37 percent), “owning and maintaining a vehicle is too
expensive”(32 percent), and “able to get transportation from others” (31
Another reason that springs to mind is that more people are living in
cities and using public transportation. But in the survey, only 17
percent said their reason for not having a license was that they
preferred public transit.
In other studies, Sivak and Schoettle suggest that driving in general
may have already peaked in the United States. The total distance driven
per person in the U.S. was at its highest in 2004, and by 2013, it had
decreased by 9 percent. In part, this may be because people are
traveling less in general: Comparing 2004 to 2014, people spent less
time traveling to places to eat and drink, to buy goods and services, to
work, school, and to leisure activities. The ease of Amazon, the rise of
teleworking, and the endless entertainment provided by the Internet may
be leading people to stay home more, but it’s hard to say—there’s no
research available that explains these trends. A /New York Times article
from 2013 mentions unemployment as a reason for young people buying
fewer cars, but as Jordan Weissman noted in /The Atlantic/
that same year, downward trends in driving started before the recession.
Maybe it’s just that people today have more things they’d rather do than
practice parallel parking between traffic cones. Or maybe it’s because
the photos on those plastic cards are almost never flattering. Sivak and
Schoettle are hoping to soon study possible reasons for the drop in
driver’s licenses. But regardless of the cause, it seems that if you
want to insult a teen today, shaming them for not being able to operate
a motor vehicle might not be the way to go.

Every society is a collective. Fascist societies maintain their
collective structure by emotional, psychological, and physically
destructive methods. In any legitimate anarchist collective society if
you don't fit somewhere, that's ok... You don't have to.
What Ben Morea of Up Against the Wall (Motherfuckers) said about the
Situationists and other anarchist cells for example:
You don't hear this sort of thing from intrinsically Fascist formations
on the left like the SWP or Revolutionary Workers Party, they're too
busy snitching each other off to the police or engaging in
informant/provocateur activities themselves.

America never had a revolution. Revolutions are based on ideology. Greed
is NOT an ideology.
Ben Franklin on the roots of that Greed:
"Sir, there are two passions which have a powerful influence on the
affairs of men. These are ambition and avarice; the love of power, and
the love of money. Separately each of these has great force in prompting
men to action; but when united in view of the same object, they have in
many minds the most violent effects.
Place before the eyes of such men, a post of honor that shall be at the
same time a place of profit, and they will move heaven and earth to
obtain it. The vast number of such places it is that renders the British
Government so tempestuous. The struggles for them are the true sources
of all these factions which are perpetually dividing the Nation,
distracting its Councils, hurrying sometimes into fruitless and
mischievous wars, and often compelling a submission to dishonorable
terms of peace.
And of what kind are the men that will strive for this profitable
pre-eminence, through all the bustle of cabal, the heat of contention,
the infinite mutual abuse of parties, tearing to pieces the best of
characters? It will not be the wise and moderate; the Iovers of peace
and good order, the men fittest for the trust. It will be the bold and
the violent, the men of strong passions and indefatigable activity in
their selfish pursuits.
These will thrust themselves into your Government and be your rulers.
And these too will be mistaken in the expected happiness of their
situation: For their vanquished competitors of the same spirit, and from
the aame motives will perpetually be endeavoring to distress their
administration, thwart their measures, and render them odious to the
people." ~Benjamin Franklin, Opposition to Executive Salaries,
Constitutional Convention June 2 1787

It was an ArpaNet machine a mid-size mainframe in an air conditioned
room. Telnet and all the Unix comm stuff had already been developed but
only a few mil companies had access to .com addresses in the early 70s
to use it. They didn't toy with the machine (just toyed with the idea of
taking an ax to it) but that's about the same time period I first heard
about telnet, ftp, irc.
Ps. Ended up pissing on it and destroying the air conditioning's access
to the room (blocked vents). Prolly caused a zillion dollars in damage.
The perps escaped into the crowd in the building as the police entered
to clear it and were never caught.

A cop saw a wanted fleeing felon in a van in a parking lot, approached

the 'standoff' they sent out a robot to place a concussion grenade under
the van and detonated it. They found out the perp had been mortally

him up.

As I pointed out in my twitter discussions of what just happened in
Dallas, referring to the 'back to africa' nature of the org's FB page
being in conflict with armed revolutionary groups (b/c the New BPP and
it's useful idiot clones like this are quite confused)., MOVE!'s
destruction (along with the city block thanks to a fire caused by a
satchel bomb PPD ILLEGALLY acquired from the FBI) was commanded because
of an adamant refusal to comply with citations regarding an illegal
compost pile and keeping livestock (chickens I believe) in city limits.

You know... If they can't prove necessity you could ALMOST get a murder
charge worked up which is normally impossible. You can't convict cops
for murder because:
"The law that authorizes federal criminal civil rights charges against
police officers says that in a homicide case ... a police officer can be
guilty only if he not only violated the victim’s Fourth Amendment right
to be free from excessive force, ***but the officer also “willfully”
violated that right***".

poor judgment do not constitute willful conduct prosecutable under the

You understated G4s' role. They ARE a mercenary recruiter with quick
reaction teams stationed in South Sudan and elsewhere. They also provide
armed security, executive protection teams, etc.
The military's already trained you to kill without compunction and never
deprogram you.
Whatever rage resides in you from that, or other experiences, is easily
steerable. When people are confused or angry they DO NOT make correctly
informed decision. Easy prey for government spooks.
Just in... Local action just as I was reading The Hill's article:
"America's anger boils over"
which is quite hot. In the eleven minutes after I posted the following,
it had *336* new comments:
    "Right now, outside this cafe' there are 3 police cars & 6 cops from
    3 different agencies because of a car without a back plate belonging
    to a local disabled vet.
    They know who the car belongs to. He has coffee here every day. He's
    an amputee who gets meds. They think he's a drug dealer because he's
    kind to the homeless and outcasts andbuys them coffee, gives them
    spare change... and the missing plate gave the police, the
    semi-deputized 'rangers' (muni codes only) and a private patrol
    company that's totally un-deputized, a chance to harass him.
    I told one of the 'rangers' (A city councilmember's son) to be
    careful... There's people out there who like to kill cops.
    Normally I wouldn't say anything of the sort in my normal dealings
    with them but f*ck them. If the act like pigs MAYBE we SHOULD make

It IS worthwhile noting the FBI has access to VERY elaborate
psychological profiles the US military keeps on it's soldiers (from day
one). It would be a lot easier for the FBI setup operators to work a US
soldier, than on some prole muslim at a US mosque.

My dad, A WWII army Colonel, later coordinator for tech writers
(InfoSec) at NASA Huntsville, military NASA...  Later a regional
coordinator for the ADL in the Southeast US until his passing in the
2007 (He stalked the KKK with a bodyguard taking pics of the 'unhoooded'
and passed other racist org intel along), in other words, 'a company
man'  told me a couple of years before he died, with some surprise in
his voice:
    "You know? You kids stopped that war!"
Yes... Yes we did. But NOT before we "Brought the war home", and it
wasn't JUST kids. BTW, he was alive for the invasion of Iraq and DID NOT
LIKE what he was seeing. SOMETHING changed about US Foreign policy in a
way he had not expected and he was looking at Pentagon 'Generals" on TV
wondering if they even knew what they were talking about.
My dad also had his security clearance threatened because of my teen
antiwar activism. THE NYPD's "Red Squad" Capt. Finnegan, the 'silver
fox', and his thugs, got my name after a guerrilla theater action and
bust at NYU's Queens campus and passed it on to the feds who weren't
aware I hadn't seen him for ten years and he had no say over me legally
or otherwise. Now they'd know. And I didn't need Ed Snowden to inform me
the US government spies on, and is scared of, it's own citizens.
Not so sure about Vietnam, an extractive resource war (Tungsten, tin,
rubber, much more incl oil in the Spratlys, S China Sea, that
Halliburton was test drilling for under mercenary and special forces
protection) but later, and now, ABSOFUCKINGLUTELY. The only thing of
value the US produces anymore is weapons systems, and it's hard to sell
them unless they've been field tested.
See this musical informative vid (sorry FB only...Youtube DMCA pulled
for more on that, and no they don't heal them, they let them die... or,
as with 'Psychological Kevlar' pre-treating for PTSD and a bunch of
other stuff, they use soldiers as guinea pigs. It's IN THE CONTRACT.
They PWN you.
I remember seeing pics of special forces guys shoveling Agent Orange
into the hoppers of Bird Dog Cessnas in Vietnam's jungles bare-chested,
without so much as a dust mask. I know a guy who has lung disease... He
was in the Navy. His job was cleaning up ship hulls for repainting. They
gave him basic dust masks but NEVER checked to make sure he was using
it.. Not that the masks would have been effective but.
Hence the title of that video: "The Pentagon: They Eat Their Own"

Occupy Wall Steeet wasn't a focused protest it was a general
insurrection and it was fun but insurrections either disintegrate or
they are crushed. I'm talking about coordinated action on a single focus
with tens of thousands of people in the streets all across the US and
all sorts of side shows like continual sabotage of the system.... The
"Dave Graebers" and other 'vanguard' types were there to fuck everything
up too, but for the most part they has so little control over
organizations that what happened on the street was not what they
intended, but EVERYONE was FOCUSED ON THE WAR.
EVERYONE knew someone killed or maimed in Vietnam, or their GF's brother
was killed there. The US government was turning college students into
cannon fodder with the draft and if your grades didn't keep up with the
continually changing requirements of the selective service... changed to
suit their manpower needs, off you went and your organized religion
wasn't gonna help you either. They'd be glad to pray over your coffin
and call you a hero though.
This is why AUTOMATED WARFARE. It IS most likely the PRIMARY REASON for it
Americans don't like to see the remains of their loved ones come home in
a sack on a C-5a Globemaster and it undermines the Pentagon's ability to
make war.
Want to change things? Anything. It take two traits utterly lacking in
American society at the moment.
Rage and Focus. Richard Nixon may have sat in to Oval Orifice during the
post-Cambodia invasion moratorium as the WH was surrounded by tens of
thousands of people with a pitched street battle between protestors and
swarms of cop on Pennsylvania Avenue.
But he 'blinked', and the US began negotiating... Carpet bombing VIetnam
at the same time with HUGE protests about that too, but within a few
years it was "Helicopters from the embassy roof".

I don't get facts from the police. If and when it occurs I get
INFORMATION from them.
There's a difference ... Nutjob.
That seems to be the sentiment of quite a few people who put their code

There's an "orchestrasted institutional slander campaign", by people who
have a bone to pick with ioerror, and it doesn't seem to be the 'bone'
that allegedly got rammed up their allegedly unwilling asses or else
there's be a police report from ONE OF THEM by now, and for your
information, NUTJOB, I have no friends that came from ANYTHING related
to computers or the industry. I make acquaintances with Libertarian
psychopaths (like you nutjob), I don't befriend them.

Fact. Juan is a TROLL who couldn't possibly have anything rational to
add to anything Schnier posts.
First ad hom and he's gone most anywhere anytime anyway.
Tough darts. No one's got the time for spew.
I have ongoing problems with the local indymedia redacting my comments
because they don't adhere to their unfathomable ideology that I can't
quite identify, so I simply don't bother posting there.
What was it someone said about freedom of the press is OWNING the press?
If Juan has something to say that Bruce Schnier doesn't want to hear or
allow in his comments he should start a blog. Write an open letter and
use all those SEO tricks to get his post noticed by the same people who
read Schnier.
The fallacious assumption you're making here is that Schnier owes him a
soapbox to respond, IF what Juan does can be considered 'responding'. No
one owes anyone shit.

I agree with everything said here. Jacob Appelbaum wears counterculture
on his sleeve. ... Some thing I remember most developers did WAY back
when personal computing first got off the ground. Wozniak, Jobs and the
rest would get shit-faced out at the Albatross on Portola while Moby
Grape played. The Chateu up on the summit and Zayante Club were
basically weekend retreats for coders to get away, smoke a bunch of
Killer Local Bud, and decompress before going back to their breadboards
and eye-destroying green-black dot-matrix montiors.
The cops used to pick up bleary-eyed tie-dye shirt wearing local coders
wandering the streets of Santa Cruz early in the morning thinking they
were 'woods hippies' to be harassed.
Now it's about money power and ego. Those rubes compromise easily. They
'drop trou', as the brits say.
But the ones who are in 'for the love of it' .... You have to dig dirt.

NOW, here's a 'conspiracy' theory...
A number of Turkish soldiers are saying they thought the coup was a
drill... Of course You'd say that too if a firing squad or beheading was
the other option.
ON THE OTHER HAND Erdogan could be seen to be setting up a fake coup to
use as excuse to kill of dissenting elements in the Turkish Military who
say he's trying to create an islamist state and use the puny,
half-assed, undermined-from-the-git coup attempt by low-level officers
(patsies to you) to cement his power, as dictator, who allows the
supplying of ‪‎ISIS‬, and whose son owns the trucks that transport, the
refineries that process, the ships that carry to market, oil stolen from
Iraq and elsewhere, again, by ISIS.

That's also my assessment. Gulen had the misfortune to know a RAND
analyst who was CIA and later vouched for him when his visa was
threatened. But he's no Dalai Lama or the guy who defected from the
Libyan army then spent 30 years living in Vienna Va before the CIA
tapped him to lead the nascent groups that killed gadaffi, or a Manny
Noriega. The fact that his visa was threatened says he's involuntary...
Also note no one was saying he'd be invited to the coup party...
MOST writeups claim he's a moderate Sufi with minor mystical tendencies.
I think he's rather stay in Pa.

    do you really think Applebaum is of the same level of importance to the things you mention -
    privacy / human rights / surveillance state, etc, as Julian Assange or Ed Snowden?
It's just teh "MAN'S" way of saying "hi... We're gonna fuck over all
your acquaintances."
Remember what Chris Dorner did to the LAPD that scared the living shit
out of them? He went after the cops' family and friends. It's classic
counterinsurgency tactic he learned from the kind of people who want to
kill Snowden and Assange.
It's NOT limited to high profile people either. I knew a woman a junkie
hooker, who was murdered so the feds could spook her memorial service to
see if her weatherman fugitive boyfriend would turn up.

That's great for Turkey (barring the scenario I presented above), but I

As far as your other missive's link goes:

    Erdogan will not forgive the Obama administration for leading him up the
    garden path on Syria, convincing him that Washington was leaving no
    stone unturned to overthrow the Assad regime
    Erdogan's hand is ISIS, and they're already all over Europe thanks to
the Russian AF rout, and they ARE mixed in with the refugee population,
and they HAVE terrorized those refugees to not talk, and IF Erdogan
doesn't get a BIG part of the Syrian Partition pie... Selah...

Not a coder so I can't supply anything more than a hunch but the
graphics security end of the 'user experience' was just recently noted here:
IOW, if you're using any browser but MS Edge Netflix DRM coding
apparently doesn't work, and many guis use browser 'parts' or... ahem,
Java, to display a gui.
Another example was the hacked LOIC dDos tool so popular with anons a
few years ago. You plugged in an IRC address/channel and the tool was
remotely operated. By whom, and what logs were kept was, and still is,
unknown. But that sort of spying is almost too crass to list as a
security flaw. The users were their own worse enemies

Power in the Age of the Feudal Internet
Discussion Papers > Internet and Security > Proposition
Bruce Schneier, Cryptographer and Computer Security Specialist and
Author of Liars and Outliers: Enabling the Trust Society Needs to Thrive
We’re in the middle of an epic battle for power in cyberspace. On one
side are the nimble, unorganized, distributed powers such as dissident
groups, criminals, and hackers. On the other side are the traditional,
organized, institutional powers such as governments and large
multinational corporations. During its early days, the Internet gave
coordination and efficiency to the powerless. It made them powerful, and
seem unbeatable. But now the more traditional institutional powers are
winning, and winning big. How these two fare long-term, and the fate of
the majority of us that don’t fall into either group, is an open
question – and one vitally important to the future of the Internet.
In its early days, there was a lot of talk about the “natural laws of
the Internet” and how it would empower the masses, upend traditional
power blocks, and spread freedom throughout the world. The international
nature of the Internet made a mockery of national laws. Anonymity was
easy. Censorship was impossible. Police were clueless about cybercrime.
And bigger changes were inevitable. Digital cash would undermine
national sovereignty. Citizen journalism would undermine the media,
corporate PR, and political parties. Easy copying would destroy the
traditional movie and music industries. Web marketing would allow even
the smallest companies to compete against corporate giants. It really
would be a new world order.
Some of this did come to pass. The entertainment industries have been
transformed and are now more open to outsiders. Broadcast media has
changed, and some of the most influential people in the media have come
from the blogging world. There are new ways to run elections and
organize politically. Facebook and Twitter really did help topple
governments. But that was just one side of the Internet’s disruptive
character. Today, the traditional corporate and government power is
ascendant, and more powerful than ever.
On the corporate side, power is consolidating around both vendor-managed
user devices and large personal-data aggregators. It’s a result of two
current trends in computing. First, the rise of cloud computing means
that we no longer have control of our data. Our e-mail, photos,
calendar, address book, messages, and documents are on servers belonging
to Google, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, and so on. And second, the rise
of vendor-managed platforms means that we no longer have control of our
computing devices. We’re increasingly accessing our data using iPhones,
iPads, Android phones, Kindles, ChromeBooks, and so on. Even Windows 8
and Apple’s Mountain Lion are heading in the direction of less user control.
I have previously called this model of computing feudal. Users pledge
allegiance to more powerful companies who, in turn, promise to protect
them from both sysadmin duties and security threats. It’s a metaphor
that’s rich in history and in fiction, and a model that’s increasingly
permeating computing today.
Feudal security consolidates power in the hands of the few. These
companies act in their own self-interest. They use their relationship
with us to increase their profits, sometimes at our expense. They act
arbitrarily. They make mistakes. They’re deliberately changing social
norms. Medieval feudalism gave the lords vast powers over the landless
peasants; we’re seeing the same thing on the Internet.
It’s not all bad, of course. Medieval feudalism was a response to a
dangerous world, and depended on hierarchical relationships with
obligations in both directions. We – especially those of us who are not
technical – like the convenience, redundancy, portability, automation,
and shareability of vendor-managed devices. We like cloud backup. We
like automatic updates. We like it that Facebook just works – from any
device, anywhere.
Government power is also increasing on the Internet. Long gone are the
days of an Internet without borders, and governments are better able to
use the four technologies of social control: surveillance, censorship,
propaganda, and use control. There’s a growing “cyber sovereignty”
movement that totalitarian governments are embracing to give them more
control – a change the US opposes, because it has substantial control
under the current system. And the cyberwar arms race is in full swing,
further consolidating government power.
In many cases, the interests of corporate and government power are
aligning. Both corporations and governments want ubiquitous
surveillance, and the NSA is using Google, Facebook, Verizon, and others
to get access to data it couldn’t otherwise. The entertainment industry
is looking to governments to enforce their antiquated business models.
Commercial security equipment from companies like BlueCoat and Sophos is
being used by oppressive governments to surveil and censor their
citizens. The same facial recognition technology that Disney uses in its
theme parks also identifies protesters in China and Occupy Wall Street
activists in New York.
What happened? How, in those early Internet years, did we get the future
so wrong?
The truth is that technology magnifies power in general, but the rates
of adoption are different. The unorganized, the distributed, the
marginal, the dissidents, the powerless, the criminal: they can make use
of new technologies faster. And when those groups discovered the
Internet, suddenly they had power. But when the already powerful big
institutions finally figured out how to harness the Internet for their
needs, they had more power to magnify. That’s the difference: the
distributed were more nimble and were quicker to make use of their new
power, while the institutional were slower but were able to use their
power more effectively. So while the Syrian dissidents used Facebook to
organize, the Syrian government used Facebook to identify dissidents.
All isn’t lost for distributed power, though. For institutional power
the Internet is a change in degree, but for distributed power it’s a
change of kind. The Internet gives decentralized groups – for the first
time – access to coordination. This can be incredibly empowering, as we
saw in the SOPA/PIPA debate, Gezi, and Brazil. It can invert power
dynamics, even in the presence of surveillance censorship and use control.
There’s another more subtle trend, one I discuss in my book Liars and
Outliers. If you think of security as an arms race between attackers and
defenders, technological advances – firearms, fingerprint
identification, lockpicks, the radio – give one side or the other a
temporary advantage. But most of the time, a new technology benefits the
attackers first.
We saw this in the early days of the Internet. As soon as the Internet
started being used for commerce, a new breed of cybercriminal emerged,
immediately able to take advantage of the new technology. It took police
a decade to catch up. And we saw it on social media, as political
dissidents made quicker use of its organizational powers before
totalitarian regimes were able to use it effectively as a surveillance
and propaganda tool. The distributed are not hindered by bureaucracy,
and sometimes not by laws or ethics. They can evolve faster.
This delay is what I call a “security gap”. It’s greater when there’s
more technology, and in times of rapid technological change. And since
our world is one in which there’s more technology than ever before, and
a greater rate of technological change than ever before, we should
expect to see a greater security gap than ever before. In other words,
there will be an increasing time period where the nimble distributed
power can make use of new technologies before the slow institutional
power can make better use of those technologies.
It’s quick vs. strong. To return to medieval metaphors, you can think of
a nimble distributed power – whether marginal, dissident, or criminal –
as Robin Hood. And you can think of ponderous institutional power – both
government and corporate – as the Sheriff of Nottingham.
So who wins? Which type of power dominates in the coming decades?
Right now, it looks like institutional power. Ubiquitous surveillance
means that it’s easier for the government to round up dissidents than it
is for the dissidents to anonymously organize. Data monitoring means it
is easier for the Great Firewall of China to block data than it is to
circumvent it. And as easy as it is to circumvent copy protection
schemes, most users can’t do it.
This is largely because leveraging power on the Internet requires
technical expertise, and most distributed power groups don’t have that
expertise. Those with sufficient technical ability will be able to stay
ahead of institutional power. Whether it’s setting up your own e-mail
server, effectively using encryption and anonymity tools, or breaking
copy protection, there will always be technologies that are one step
ahead of institutional power. This is why cybercrime is still pervasive,
even as institutional power increases, and why organizations like
Anonymous are still a social and political force. If technology
continues to advance – and there’s no reason to believe it won’t – there
will always be a security gap in which technically savvy Robin Hoods can
My main concern is for the rest of us: everyone in the middle. These are
people who don’t have the technical ability to evade either the large
governments and corporations that are controlling our Internet use, or
the criminal and hacker groups who prey on us. These are the people who
accept the default configuration options, arbitrary terms of service,
NSA-installed back doors, and the occasional complete loss of their
data. In the feudal world, these are the hapless peasants. And it’s even
worse when the feudal lords – or any powers – fight each other.
As anyone watching Game of Thrones knows, peasants get trampled when
powers fight: when Facebook, Google, Apple, and Amazon fight it out in
the market; when the US, EU, China, and Russia fight it out in
geopolitics; or when it’s the US vs. the terrorists or China vs. its
dissidents. The abuse will only get worse as technology continues to
advance. In the battle between institutional power and distributed
power, more technology means more damage. Cybercriminals can rob more
people more quickly than criminals who have to physically visit everyone
they rob. Digital pirates can make more copies of more things much more
quickly than their analog forebears. And 3D printers mean that the data
use restriction debate now involves guns, not movies. It’s the same
problem as the “weapons of mass destruction” fear: terrorists with
nuclear or biological weapons can do a lot more damage than terrorists
with conventional explosives.
It’s a numbers game. Very broadly, assume there’s a particular crime
rate society is willing to tolerate. With historically inefficient
criminals, we were willing to live with some percentage of criminals in
our society. As technology makes each individual criminal more powerful,
the percentage we can tolerate decreases. This is essentially the
“weapons of mass destruction” debate: as the amount of damage each
individual terrorist can do increases, we need to do increasingly more
to prevent even a single terrorist success.
The more destabilizing the technologies, the greater the rhetoric of
fear, and the stronger institutional power will get. This means even
more repressive security measures, even if the security gap means that
such measures are increasingly ineffective. And it will squeeze the
peasants in the middle even more.
Without the protection of feudal lords, we’re subject to abuse by
criminals and other feudal lords. Also, there are often no other options
but to align with someone. But both these corporations and the
government – and sometimes the two in cahoots – are using their power to
their own advantage, trampling on our rights in the process. And without
the technical savvy to become Robin Hoods ourselves, we have no recourse
but to submit to whatever institutional power wants.
So what happens as technology increases? Is a police state the only
effective way to control distributed power and keep our society safe? Or
do the fringe elements inevitably destroy society as technology
increases their power? Probably neither doomsday scenario will come to
pass, but figuring out a stable middle ground is hard. These questions
are complicated, and dependent on future technological advances that we
cannot predict. But they are primarily political questions, and any
solutions will be political.
In the short term, we need more transparency and oversight. The more we
know of what institutional powers are doing, the more we can trust that
they are not abusing their authority. We have long known this to be true
in government, but we have increasingly ignored it in our fear of
terrorism and other modern threats. This is also true for corporate
power. Unfortunately, market dynamics will not necessarily force
corporations to be transparent; we need laws to do that. The same is
true for decentralized power; transparency is how we will differentiate
political dissidents from criminal organizations.
Oversight is also critically important, and is another long-understood
mechanism for checking power. This can be a combination of things:
courts that act as third-party advocates for the rule of law rather than
rubber-stamp organizations, legislatures that understand the
technologies and how they affect power balances, and vibrant
public-sector press and watchdog groups that analyze and debate the
actions of those wielding power.
Transparency and oversight give us the confidence to trust institutional
powers to fight the bad side of distributed power, while still allowing
the good side to flourish. For if we are going to entrust our security
to institutional powers, we need to know they will act in our interests
and not abuse that power. Otherwise, democracy fails.
In the longer term, we need to work to reduce power differences. The key
to all of this is access to data. On the Internet, data is power. To the
extent the powerless have access to it, they gain in power. To the
extent that the already powerful have access to it, they further
consolidate their power. As we look to reducing power imbalances, we
have to look at data: data privacy for individuals, mandatory disclosure
laws for corporations, and open government laws.
Medieval feudalism evolved into a more balanced relationship in which
lords had responsibilities as well as rights. Today’s Internet feudalism
is both ad-hoc and one-sided. Those in power have a lot of rights, but
increasingly few responsibilities or limits. We need to rebalance this
relationship. In medieval Europe, the rise of the centralized state and
the rule of law provided the stability that feudalism lacked. The Magna
Carta first forced responsibilities on governments and put humans on the
long road toward government by the people and for the people. In
addition to re-reigning in government power, we need similar
restrictions on corporate power: a new Magna Carta focused on the
institutions that abuse power in the 21st century.
Today’s Internet is a fortuitous accident: a combination of an initial
lack of commercial interests, government benign neglect, military
requirements for survivability and resilience, and computer engineers
building open systems that worked simply and easily. Corporations have
turned the Internet into an enormous revenue generator, and they’re not
going to back down easily. Neither will governments, which have
harnessed the Internet for political control.
We’re at the beginning of some critical debates about the future of the
Internet: the proper role of law enforcement, the character of
ubiquitous surveillance, the collection and retention of our entire
life’s history, how automatic algorithms should judge us, government
control over the Internet, cyberwar rules of engagement, national
sovereignty on the Internet, limitations on the power of corporations
over our data, the ramifications of information consumerism, and so on.
This won’t be an easy period for us as we try to work these issues out.
Historically, no shift in power has ever been easy. Corporations have
turned our personal data into an enormous revenue generator, and they’re
not going to back down. Neither will governments, who have harnessed
that same data for their own purposes. But we have a duty to tackle this
Data is the pollution problem of the information age. All computer
processes produce it. It stays around. How we deal with it -- how we
reuse and recycle it, who has access to it, how we dispose of it, and
what laws regulate it -- is central to how the information age
functions. And I believe that just as we look back at the early decades
of the industrial age and wonder how society could ignore pollution in
their rush to build an industrial world, our grandchildren will look
back at us during these early decades of the information age and judge
us on how we dealt with the rebalancing of power resulting from all this
new data.
I can’t tell you what the result will be. These are all complicated
issues, and require meaningful debate, international cooperation, and
innovative solutions. We need to decide on the proper balance between
institutional and decentralized power, and how to build tools that
amplify what is good in each while suppressing the bad.

McDonald's 'Make Burger History' Site Hijacked With Offensive Burger Ideas
    "Just come in to a participating 'Create Your Taste' McDonald's and

    promised. But its failure to consider what pranksters might dream up

    ...The burger concepts ranged from the mild, such as "Bag of

    "Girth" (a stack of seven undressed burger patties) and "Ron's

Common wisdom and most reliable reports say Turkey has US Nukes on it's

installations to monitor Russian comms during the so-called 'cold war'.
Tora Bora was also a sigint facility for that purpose. Iran had them too.
There was no danger whatsoever of the nukes being misappropriated by the

Hi Zeenan...
You never DID get back to me about where you got that perverse
interpolation of some salafist screed about the rules of Goat-Fucking,
Here are some references.
The basic tenets of the religion of hate analyzed...
Also see: Open Letter to al-Bagdadi and ISIS by Muslim scholars from
around the world.
1. It is forbidden in Islam to issue fatwas without all the necessary
learning requirements. Even then fatwas must follow Islamic legal theory
as defined in the Classical texts. It is also forbidden to cite a
portion of a verse from the Qur’an—or part of a verse—to derive a ruling
without looking at everything that the Qur’an and Hadith teach related
to that matter.
In other words, there are strict subjective and objective prerequisites
for fatwas , and one cannot ‘cherry-pick’ Qur’anic verses for legal
arguments without considering the entire Qur’an and Hadith .
2. It is forbidden in Islam to issue legal rulings about anything
without mastery of the Arabic language.
3. It is forbidden in Islam to oversimplify Shari’ah matters and ignore
established Islamic sciences.
4. It is permissible in Islam [for scholars] to differ on any matter,
except those fundamentals of religion that all Muslims must know.
5. It is forbidden in Islam to ignore the reality of contemporary times
when deriving legal rulings.
6. It is forbidden in Islam to kill the innocent.
7. It is forbidden in Islam to kill emissaries, ambassadors, and
diplomats; hence it is forbidden to kill journalists and aid workers.
8. Jihad in Islam is defensive war. It is not permissible without the
right cause, the right purpose and without the right rules of conduct.
9. It is forbidden in Islam to declare people non-Muslim unless he (or
she) openly declares disbelief.
10. It is forbidden in Islam to harm or mistreat—in any way—Christians
or any ‘People of the Scripture’.
11. It is obligatory to consider Yazidis as People of the Scripture.
12. The re-introduction of slavery is forbidden in Islam. It was
abolished by universal consensus.
13. It is forbidden in Islam to force people to convert.
14. It is forbidden in Islam to deny women their rights.
15. It is forbidden in Islam to deny children their rights.
16. It is forbidden in Islam to enact legal punishments (hudud ) without
following the correct procedures that ensure justice and mercy.
17. It is forbidden in Islam to torture people.
18 It is forbidden in Islam to disfigure the dead.
19. It is forbidden in Islam to attribute evil acts to God.
20. It is forbidden in Islam to destroy the graves and shrines of
Prophets and Companions.
21.Armed insurrection is forbidden in Islam for any reason other than
clear disbelief by the ruler and not allowing people to pray.
22. It is forbidden in Islam to declare a caliphate without consensus
from all Muslims.
23. Loyalty to one’s nation is permissible in Islam.
24. After the death of the Prophet, Islam does not require anyone to
emigrate anywhere.

"It is forbidden in Islam to ignore the reality of contemporary

religions, for better or worse, will go with that flow.
As little as I like organized religions they ARE a vehicle for moving
masses of people in a given direction. Too bad psychopaths take over

My understanding is the Islamic banks have a 'workaround'. Instead of
charging interest you simply owe the loan amount plus whatever the
interest is. If you borrow $100 and the interest is 5% you've borrowed
$105 dollars. Except for the more extreme fundamentalists, it's been
accepted that way for a long time.
No one said "point 5" was gonna be easy...

    The Persian civilization spawned three major religions:
    Zoroastrianism, Manichaeism (which heavily influenced Saint
    Augustine before he turned to Christianity), and the Bahá'í Faith.
    They even contributed greatly to Islam. Another religion that arose
    from ancient Iran is Mazdakism, which has been dubbed the first
    communistic ideology.

I really really wanted an Altair when I saw it in a boys life magazine
circa 1967-8 but my parents were NEVER going to shell out that kind of
money so I missed the early days of personal computing.
I started with Basic V1.1 on an Epson HX-20 CP/M laptop in the mid-late 80s.
Wrote a terminal/logging program which I used on BBSs and Packet Radio
that ran  baud that would also spit out a printed log of the radio
contact. I wrote it myself from examples provided in the Epson manual
that was full of mistakes I had to debug and correct.
I went to a Tandy ColorComputer and Basic09, then OS9 L1 and L2
(microware for 68XXX chips)
Then I learned a little C, but before I could dig in there was C+ and
C++ and then...
...and then I figured out unless I was getting paid  for writing code so
I could write them off I simply couldn't afford the INCREDIBLY PRICED
books on the subject... A subject that was changing at lightspeed...
before WWW tutorials etc.
I did pick up enough Jscript to get me in trouble though.
I apologize to NO ONE for not posting directly code-related items. That
IS NOT the purpose of this list according to EVERYTHING I've managed to
find about it historically and suspect it just more feudal bullshit from
people who 'came lately' to the coding world, and as I claimed before,
came for the money.
By the time I figured out there was money to be made. I could already
see, considering I lived in the heart of it, all the psychopaths
flocking to 'the next big thing' and decided I would NEVER EVER EVER do
code work for a living (at least in the US). I was looking at Cisco
books laying around at the Gym when CIsco started up and saw that I had
learned 99% of it playing with packet radio, iNos jNos and TPK.
Fuck 'em. Fuck their money. You can train a CHILD or that guy sitting on
the ground downtown panhandling to do coding. It's NOT brain surgery.
And the arrogance of people I see in the industry is still profoundly

Was just discussing my ColorComputer 3 on another thread. It had a 68xx
chip and at 4mhz could run Multivue, a GUI based on the Xerox PARC model
(written in C... the manual had ALL the code) in a unix-like system
(Microware OS9) that could run rings around any PC of the time. Multiple
shells, it wasn't necessary to hard code memory locations if you wrote
code for it (Relocatable Object Memory) and all. I hung onto it until it
became totally obsolete.

The Weaponising Of Social Part 1: The Crucifixion of IOError
by The Indicter
Thanks to a small group of supposed anonymity-protecting privacy
activists thousands of people now know the name of Jacob Appelbaum’s
fiancée`. Even those that didn’t want to.
We found it out by reading an extremely controversial website launched a
week ago, that had a few sparse accounts of some nasty sounding
happenings allegedly involving Jacob, with promises of more to come.
No one truly concerned with privacy issues should care if Jacob has a
fiancée let alone who she is, out of respect for his right to a private
life and because it is patently obvious that attacks on him shouldn’t
extend to her.
Her name was later removed after the bulk of the damage had been done,
without any editorial admission that it had ever been there in the first
Unfortunately, that simple yet far-reaching invasion of privacy, is only
the tip of the iceberg.
[Update 12/06/16: Detractors are claiming the above is factually
incorrect as they say Appelbaum is no longer engaged. The source was the
smear website itself, which named Appelbaum’s ‘partner’, then removed
her name and called her his ‘fiancée’, and now implies past tense. IMO,
who he is or isn’t engaged to is frankly his own business. The point
In a strange paradox, Jacob Appelbaum’s accusers both want to deny any
relevance between their accusations and him being a known target of the
US government as a result of the nature of his work, while having the
clearly stated aim of wanting to prevent him from being able to continue it.
Even as they are being dwarfed, swept aside and forgotten in the
controversy, the topics on which Jacob Appelbaum and WikiLeaks work are
much larger and more important than any individual.  Those who
concertedly dedicate themselves to such causes are unjustly forced to
quite literally risk our safety, our families, our livelihoods, our
citizenships, our liberty and everything we own, in our fight to
preserve our ideals and our planet.
The high stakes in a situation like this demand more than knee-jerk
reactions, hearsay, and because-all-my-friends-say, when one of us is
attacked or discredited. They deserve the investment of time; of
serious, weighty yet measured consideration; analysis; and
investigation. All of the elements that should be prerequisite to
forming any intellectual opinon, let alone one where reputations and
potentially lives are at stake.
But we are yet to see any of that, at least anything more in-depth than
a series of personal statements via “Twitlonger”. Just a whole lot of
uproar; a whole lot more silence; and a bunch of axe-grinding. With very
little actual analysis, because the topic of rape is so taboo that most
people are shit scared of approaching it objectively.
As such, this post should be subtitled “We Owe IO More Than 600 Words”.
Because we do. We owe him much, much more than that.
We owe it to him and to our causes, to find out the truth.
Preamble dispensed with, I’m going to give some historical context to
what made me write this article and analyse the claims made on and by
the anti-IO website. In Part 2 of this article, we will look into the
main personalities that appear to be driving this, discuss some of the
environmental factors affecting the response and get into the wider
context, which is all but being ignored
Lessons Long-Since Learned
The website now being widely sourced as justification for dismantling
Appelbaum’s career and reputation does as much to discredit itself as it
does to discredit Jacob.
That the name of the female closest to him was disclosed in a forum that
claims to exist to protect women was not the first red flag.
Several years ago, a situation unfolded where a prominent activist
(Activist A)  was privately accused of rape by another activist
(Activist B). This was then broadcast far and wide through the creation
of a Twitter account that purported to be Activist B talking directly
and openly about her first hand experience of being raped by Activist A.
Many fell for it, and instantaneously an online frenzy was being whisked
up against Activist A. For all the same – on the surface – seemingly
valid reasons that we see people turning on Jacob Appelbaum for now.
However, when I read the tweets of the account calling for the
persecution of Activist A, I innately knew that what I was reading was
not the words of a rape survivor. It came across to me as someone trying
to posture themselves as one, out of empathy and/or indignation, rather
than legitimately recounting an actual firsthand memory of a personal
So I did the socially unacceptable but morally right thing and spoke
out. While people were aghast that I dared to question a “victim” – the
facade soon crumbled and it turned out that my instincts were absolutely
The account claiming to be a rape victim was not Activist B at all. It
was Activist C, her boyfriend, who had (according to Activist B, without
her knowledge) taken it upon himself to impersonate her and attack
Activist A in public after she had raised issues in confidence. There
had been some question of infidelity, she had privately claimed lack of
consent, Activist C had decided that Activist A’s life should be ruined
as a result, and gone public.
Whether or not Activist A ever did in fact rape Activist B got lost in
the controversy of Activist C’s foolish meddling in the entire
situation. Activist A claimed no. Activist B claimed yes. Activist C
permanently obscured the situation by his actions.
So how was I able to immediately identify, on gut feeling, that this
anonymous account claiming to be a rape victim was not a rape victim?
And why did I risk my “social capital” to speak out on such a highly
contentious topic?
Because people who are not survivors of rape cannot competently
impersonate survivors of rape. They think the act itself is the whole
story but it is just a tiny fraction of it. So when they attempt to
concoct the scenario, they always limit it to the specific event rather
than the holistic experience, the emotional journey.
Rape Testimony
Real rape testimony is 20% what physically happened and 80% how it
affected us. It is visceral. It is memories and shapes and impressions
and images. It is sights and smells and feelings, a twisted nostalgia we
would desperately like to free ourselves from but cannot ever. It is
asymmetrical and it evolves. It unfolds. The expression of it is a
cathartic, painful release but a necessary step in the healing.
It is not a telegram. It is not a thematical construct with set form or
submission rules.
They are not a fixed length. Nor fixed sentence structures. They do not
have a statistical linguistic pattern. They are not uniform. They ebb
and flow in proportion to the victim’s telling. They sway and move,
mobile in the outpouring of emotion, of grief.
When multiple examples of rape testimonies are compared side by side,
they don’t conform in any way save in their effective translation of
trauma, of a raw and primal pain.
So when I realised the extent to which the accounts on the anti-Jacob
website do conform and began to note other anomalies, huge alarm bells
started ringing.
Speaking From Experience
As someone intimately acquainted with the plight of survivors, you can
feel inside you when something is just not right with a situation like
this. As a survivor, my personal obligation to other victims and to the
truth has led me to speak up several times in the past – even when it is
utterly humiliating, damaging to my reputation or even outright
dangerous to do so. This is not an expectation I have of others – I have
the benefit of the passage of time, maturity, experience and healing –
water under the bridge – that many others don’t. Thus I spoke out in an
article addressing statements made by the Minister of Police and the
grotesquely poor conduct of NZ cops in handling sexual assault including
my own historical abduction and gang rape. I likewise spoke the
difficult and humiliating truth against the notorious ‘FBI’ snitch Sabu
when he assumed the identity of one of my friends in order to target me
sexually, in an attempt to entrap me. I spoke out about my favourite
publication in the world when a new staffer there published a ridiculous
pile of rape apologist bullshit. I spoke out against the self-admitted
serial pack rapists known as The RoastBusters who weren’t even so much
as arrested after bragging about stupefying and pack-raping dozens of
13-16 year old girls. Then I spoke out against media’s irresponsible
reporting on the issue. And again, when the Minister of Justice used the
plight of the many Roastbusters victims who had received no justice
whatsoever, in order to falsely justify the passage of anti-trolling
Even though it triggered the hell out of me to do so, I attended protest
events, supported movements, and covered live actions in support of
survivors, and in defiance of the repressive tactics wielded by New
Zealand’s blatantly corrupt and incompetent police forces, who so
profoundly fail survivors, and the public.
As faithfully as I spoke out in all those cases, so must I speak out too
when I believe that rape testimony may be being falsely manufactured, or
manipulated, or misrepresented, or used to serve the ulterior motives
and agenda of someone(s) who may not be rape survivors at all.
“Believe victims“, some people say. The key word is not believe. The key
word is victims. Not “believe any two-bit twat(s) who impersonate
survivors and/or edit rape testimony because they have something to gain
by smearing someone all over the net, in the name of other victims.”
Especially when in doing so, knowingly or not, those someone(s) are also
serving the interests of The Empire and damaging movements that people
pay dearly to create, build and sustain. (If you are in any doubt about
this take note that among the first people gloating about Jacob
Appelbaum’s perceived downfall was in fact, Sabu.)
For The Empire, I can assure you, does not give the slightest flying
shit about rape victims, unless they can be used to its advantage. On a
daily basis, it perpetuates and facilitates mass rape all over the
world, while expending tax dollars to cement and maintain all of the
societal and environmental conditions that create rape culture.
The double-edged sword of the taboo of rape was constantly wielded
against Julian Assange and his supporters over the last five years,
albeit with ever-dwindling effectiveness. Allegations of rape against
information activists are a lose-lose situation for us but a ‘win’ for
our enemies, and that is again apparent in Appelbaum’s case. The end
result is a real-life example of why these types of accusations are such
an efficient tool for those wishing to utterly devastate and
incapacitate a perceived rival. It emboldens the targets enemies and
silences their friends. It isolates them and eclipses all their prior
For all these reasons I cannot merely sit silent, or put out an
ambiguous 600-word opinion piece sitting on a fence.
Instead I did what I do best. I read, read, read, read and read more.
Dug, investigated and analysed.
The following, is my findings.

WhatsApp Forensic Artifacts: Chats Aren’t Being Deleted
Posted on July 28, 2016
Sorry, folks, while experts are saying the encryption checks out in
WhatsApp, it looks like the latest version of the app tested leaves
forensic trace of all of your chats, even after you’ve deleted, cleared,
or archived them… even if you “Clear All Chats”. In fact, the only way
to get rid of them appears to be to delete the app entirely.
To test, I installed the app and started a few different threads. I then
archived some, cleared, some, and deleted some threads. I made a second
backup after running the “Clear All Chats” function in WhatsApp. None of
these deletion or archival options made any difference in how deleted
records were preserved. In all cases, the deleted SQLite records
remained intact in the database.
More, including 'How WhatsApp Can Fix This':

Personally I think having to expose the phone number of a smartphone to
another user to establish a chat is an incredible security risk in the
short and long run and leads to all sorts of metadata harvesting of your
unencrypted info. It appears one should keep a low-budget smartphone for
that use instead of their main number for better persec. I questioned Morgan Mayhem (Intercept's sysadmin/cybersec guy) about
that when he broached how secure signal is (he's one of the developers)
on his twitter feed. Never got a reply.
Telegram allows the use of an  instead of exposing your number if
you set up an account but I'm unsure what happens when a connection is
established and the contact is added to you contact list

I agree. They're like flash drives. RF inert... BUT:
It appears the card needs to be in the phone for this to work, and I'm
almost positive 'airline mode' would disable it, because the
transmitter/receiver in the phone is disabled, because the CIA (or
whomever) just doesn't have enough excuses if planes keep crashing into
mountainsides due to Cellphone RF interfering with their electronic nav
gear so the CIA can get the contact list and pussy pics from you sim card.

Right. The REMOVABLE sim card needs to be phone powered and even flight
mode would kill anyone's ability to R/w access the card's data. What
happens when the phone is powered on? Well that's why they're called
"Smartphones"... because they're smarter than the typical user.
Unless you expect an immediate drone strike as soon as they geo-locate
seconds after the first cellsite polls your phone, you buy a burner
android from tracphone or Virginmobile at your nearest 7-11. Use it, and
burn it. IF what you're doing is so fucking important and secretive, you
can afford the $29.95.

I didn't tell anyone to use tor in my post and that's right... They
aren't really paying attention. They're just storing data for
"attention" at some point when it becomes worthwhile to them. In five
minutes, 5 hours, years, or never. The idea is to fly under the radar so
it's 'never'.

Not EVERYTHING! Go about your biz... Nothing to see here. Just some
dickpics, move along.
But if you need security. Use a computer you've never used before in a
town or place you've never been before for your secure coms then destroy
it and do the same with the $5 burner phone from 7-11. I figure it would
take at least a 1/2 hour or so before a Predator Drone made it to that
location from the nearest military base so you have some time.
The implication is if you're publicly 'subversive' on the internet in
any way that's really a threat there's no way to secure anything and
you're essentially, as someone once said about 'revolutionaries', a
'dead man on furlough'.

A> One person's 'under the bus' is another person's 'distancing'.
Steele's post was an industry standard employer liability distancing.
The slander originated at a twitter account, and github. How Steele
learned of the allegations was most likely direct complaints. The fact
the the authorities weren't brought in by torproject pre-emptively
(which IS what a company will do if there are criminal allegations) most
likely indicates they believed the charges were baseless, but distancing
is what you do anyway.

Personally I believe in obfuscation... The less the spooks know the
better including knowing of your evasion by taunting them (/depends on
what your trying to accomplish I guess/). For browsers like firefox
there's IPFuck and a user-agent string changer that allows one to spoof
another browser or create a "/Could be mutt but fucked if I'm telling
you/" string. Must be some tool like that for mail user-agents.

What? You exshpect to live forever?
Three months is a lifetime. Use it wisely.
Ps. there's a high probability of metadata being matched to users using
simple search techniques.
A Stanford graduate student has shown just how easily names can be
matched with phone records, contradicting some of the legal
justification offered by federal authorities for the National Security
Agencyâs bulk collection of phone data.
President Barack Obama said in June that the surveillance captured only
which telephone numbers were connected to others. âThere are no names â¦
in that database,â Obama said.
Just last week, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), chair of the Senate
Intelligence Committee, said cell phone customers had no reasonable
expectation to privacy because the data collected by the NSA because it
did not contain their names.
But researcher Jonathan Mayer and co-author Patrick Mutchler reported
that theyâd gathered thousands of phone numbers from volunteers and
checked various public online directories to link some of the 5,000
numbers chosen at random from their database to individuals.
With âmarginal effort,â they matched more than 27 percent of the numbers
using just Yelp, Google Places and Facebook.
They then randomly sampled 100 numbers from the database and ran Google
searches for each.
âIn under an hour, we were able to associate an individual or a business
with 60 of the 100 numbers,â Mayer wrote. âWhen we added in our three
initial sources, we were up to 73.
"Between Intelius, Google search and our three initial sources, we
associated a name with 91 of the 100 numbers,â

I'm not defending "the pentagon's 'anonimity' network." I'm saying, in
so many words, that even the most compromised network still has uses if
you know that the network is compromised. And in the case of something
like tor if everyone used it that would increase the efforts needed to
stalk the network. Even if every node was compromised, sifting through X
packets is more expensive in any number of measures than sifting through
x to the 6th power packets.
My take is dissuading people from using it because it's compromised
destroys what little effectiveness it might have, and as the gubmint
would like, renders it useless.
By that logic, you're the fed Juan.

In SOME PLACES they do that, or if they can't, they JAIL YOU (Ferguson,
Mo is classic...)
In California they go one better. All municipal infractions without
criminal penalties are turned over to a state-mandated private
collection agency and the municipalities receive a percentage of the
value of the tickets. The collection agency then duns you for two years
trying to collect then turns them over to the state IRS (Franchise Tax
Board) which pays them the uncollected amount.
Now... apply that to a houseless jobless person, and there has to be
hundreds of thousands, literally, in California, with zero ability to
pay sometime HUNDREDS of camping and other nuisance ordinance tickets
they might receive over the years. Besides the harassment value of
writing those tickets which is repaid to the municipality by the
collection agency on receipt, the state's taxpayers pay for the cost of
the ticket, and that money is locked into the judicial-law enforcement
industrial complex instead of being used to, lets say, build low cost
and affordable housing. Providing job development, re-integration

Facing Data Deluge, Secret U.K. Spying Report Warned of Intelligence Failure
    97 percent of the calls, messages, and data the program had
    collected were found to have been ânot viewedâ by the authorities.
"The amount of data being collected, however, proved difficult for MI5
to handle. In March 2010, in another secret report, concerns were
reiterated about the agencyâs difficulties processing the material it
was harvesting. âThere is an imbalance between collection and
exploitation capabilities, resulting in a failure to make effective use
of some of the intelligence collected today,â the report noted. âWith
the exception of the highest priority investigations, a lack of staff
and tools means that investigators are presented with raw and unfiltered
DIGINT data. Frequently, this material is not fully assessed because of
the significant time required to review it.â
The problem was not unique to MI5.
Many of the agencyâs larger-scale surveillance operations were being
conducted in coordination with the National Technical Assistance Centre,
a unit of the electronic eavesdropping agency Government Communications
Headquarters, better known as GCHQ.
The Centre plays a vital but little-known role. One of its main
functions is to act as a kind of intermediary, managing the highly
sensitive data-sharing relationships that exist among British
telecommunications companies and law enforcement and spy agencies.
Perhaps the most important program the Centre helps deliver is
code-named PRESTON, which covertly intercepts phone calls, text
messages, and internet data sent or received by people or organizations
in the U.K. who have been named as surveillance targets on warrants
signed off by a government minister.
A top-secret 2009 study found that, in one six-month period, the PRESTON
program had intercepted more than 5 million communications. Remarkably,
97 percent of the calls, messages, and data it had collected were found
to have been ânot viewedâ by the authorities.
The authors of the study were alarmed because PRESTON was supposedly
focused on known suspects, and yet most of the communications it was
monitoring appeared to be getting ignored â meaning crucial intelligence
could have been missed.
âOnly a small proportion of the Preston Traffic is viewed,â they noted.
âThis is of concern as the collection is all warranted.â
In full:
Again. IF EVERYONE was using Tor, PGP, etc, NO MATTER HOW FLAWED OR
COMPROMISED, it WOULD break them, and their respective country's treasury.
Promoting the idea we SHOULDN'T use it and 'spread the risk' is a useful
idiot's cowardly POV.

Let's talk about Orlando. Then tell me I'm a cop, cop.
Bringing Home A Thug: The Orlando Night Club Massacreâ¬ victims were gay
perhaps BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT! Itâs the end result of âThe Politics of
a Perpetrator Populationâ
For a start, and for your information, the Wounded Knee Massacre of Natives on this continent was the largest Mass Murder in US history.
I wonder how THEY âgender-identifiedâ?
Unfortunately for the FBI, the nightmare in Orlando isnât turning out to
 be the perfect recruiting tool to get LGBTs to practice their newfound 'liberationâ joining them in spying on their own citizens or recruiting in an imperial military, but I suspect there WILL be a rush to join in the slaughter of dark-skinned people in faraway places by the completely
 ignorant .
But let me get to the point here. Itâs a point Iâve made repeatedly over
 the years. What happened in Orlando is the end result of a nation that keeps out ECONOMIC IMMIGRANTS but LOVES to bring home their thugs.
ARVN soldiers, who later terrorized their own communities with Military-style home-invasion robberies. The people they victimized in San Jose California were too scared to talk to the police who admitted they couldnât protect them.
Iraq & Afghan interpreters who worked with the CIA and various contractors like Caci (G4s, the shooterâs employer /does interpreting-interrogation work too
 to 'interpretâ the screams of their tortured fellow citizens for the US
 intelligence community. Sometimes, a LOT of the time, they even end up the victims of stings by the organizations who paid them to spy on their
 own communities in the US. Many areâ¦ Umnâ¦ 'less-than-brightâ. I feel ZERO sympathy for them except for the fact/those folks are often literally 'morons
Right now, the Defense Language institute would LOVE to have you visit Monterey California if youâre a Pashtun speaker, or speaker of obscure dialects unique to South and Central Asia. Hell they even have BUS SERVICE developed for those folks to commute from other cities in the area like my town!
Then thereâs Chechens who fought our dirty terror war against Russia in the 90s and their families. The Tsarnaevs immediately come to mind. Former CIA director/Porter Goss on that dirty war you never heard of
Colombian & Guamanian mercs who worked for the Pentagon in Iraq and Afghanistan in return for citizenship status.
AM I making my point for you? Stop making this about LGBTs. Itâs NOT about âªâLGBTâ¬-s!
The VICTIMS WERE perhaps âªGayâ¬-identified, but itâs REALLY THE CHICKENS COMING HOME TO ROOST
 folksâ¦ YOU ALLOW the thugs to be protected and nurtured but people with
 drive ambition and the willingness to work hard are rejectedâ¦ Sent back
 to their countries often to be tortured and killedâ¦ FOR YOUR WAY OF LIFE and the continuation of it â¦ AND IT IS KILLING YOU NOW. Itâs the end result of âThe Politics of a Perpetrator Populationâ. You are becoming the victims of your own murderous way of interacting with the rest of the world that you as Americans seem so oblivious to â¦ So oblivious that youâd actually think about electing a warmonger like Bernie Sanders as some sort of alternative.

killer' who snapped and decided to kill a bunch in one burst.

U.S. District Judge Robert Bryan ordered the FBI to produce
            the full code of its malware.
            The government refused.
            Iâm not making that up.
            A federal judge told the government to do something and the
            FBI essentially said, âHow you gonna make me?â
            This is not good.
    I thought Apple had a really solid argument for refusing to help the
    government hack into one of their phones that was used by the San
    Bernardino shooter. The government eventually figured out how to do
    it without Appleâs help, but I donât think a company should be
    forced to break its own system.
    Same goes for the government. I donât think the government should be
    compelled to reveal its code for catching criminals. Donât get me
    wrong, I do think the government should be compelled to reveal that
    it has a code or a hack or some malware that allows it to spy on us.
    I think they should have to explain in plain English how it works,
    and I think we should be able to have a national, public
    conversation about whether or not we want to the government to have
    this kind of power. But I see limited upside in forcing the
    government to reveal the actual code for its software, if it doesnât
    want to and reasonably believes that revealing the code would do
    real harm.
    However, there are consequences to that position. If the government
    obtains evidence against you, you have the right to know how they
    did it. If the government doesnât want to reveal that to you, well,
    then you get to take a walk. That might sound âunfairâ to the vast
    majority of Americans who would trade seemingly all their liberties
    for a little enhanced security, but the Fourth Amendment is there to
    protect you from the government even when you donât know you need
    protecting.
    All of these competing interests are coming to a head in a
    Washington case involving an alleged child pornographer. The FBI
    obtained evidence against Jay Michaud, a local teacher, by placing
    malware on a Tor site frequented by âdark webâ users.
    Michaudâs attorneys would like to see the code used by the
    government to gather evidence against their client. Normally, thatâs
    a pretty standard and reasonable request. Unfortunately, other dark
    web users would also really like to know how the FBI is catching
    them. Getting their hands on the code would be huge. Even if the
    code is produced in âsealedâ documents, we canât pretend that we
    live in a leak-free world.
    U.S. District Judge Robert Bryan ordered the FBI to produce the full
    code of its malware.
    The government refused.
    Iâm not making that up.
    A federal judge told the government to do something and the FBI
    essentially said, âHow you gonna make me?â
    This is not good. This is a borderline constitutional crisis. In
    response, Judge Bryan tossed the evidence against Michaud obtained
    by the malware, but allowed the case to continue. On Simple Justice,
    Scott Greenfield has written passionately about how Judge Bryan
    caved to pressure from the executive branch.
    (Judge Kneels And Welcomes His Governmental Overlords link)
    I donât think the FBI should be compelled to release its code. Iâm
    reminded of when the Allies broke the Enigma code, a story recently
    popularized in the movie The Imitation Game. Once we broke the
    German code, we didnât stop every attack we knew was coming.
    Preserving the hack was more important than preventing individual
    losses. People died because we didnât want to reveal what we had.
    There were consequences to our decision.
    Here, Judge Bryan should have tossed the whole case against Michaud.
    That should be the consequence of the FBIâs decision. Yes, that
    means one alleged child pornographer and teacher goes free. Yes,
    that is unfortunate. But if the FBI really wants to protect its
    code, then they should be willing to give up this one guy for all of
    the information they are getting through using this hack.
    Itâs a difficult decision, but if the FBI and Judge Bryan donât want
    to make it, they should get into the cupcake business and leave the
    balancing of liberty and security to sterner men and women.
    Prosecute the alleged criminal under the agreed upon rules that are
    there to protect all of us, or do not. There is no try.

I'd agree you know. For instance our nation learned that wars to hold

Dover AFB... So why 'go there' when we can get some vicious freak

There's historical evidence to dispute the concept that Stalin was "Mad".
A biography written about a decade ago included a conversation between
Stalin, and his son, who was influence peddling the family name. To the
best of my recollection the convo went like this:
Stalin to his son: "You are not "Stalin". I am not "Stalin". "Stalin" is
that person you hear about on the radio and read about in the newspapers"
Josef Stalin was aware that his persona had been hijacked and he was not
in charge of all events that were occurring in his name. Compare to
Hitler, who was thoroughly delusional.

Not that the design engineering is all that... Recently, within the last
week or so in California a skin diver accidentally got into the cooling
intake system for a nuclear power plant. I'd guess they can't really put
screens on the inlets as trash would quickly clog it but you'd think,
with all the millions of dollars spent on designing these things they
would have come up with some way of keeping debris, and errant divers, out.
It's been discussed, and has been hanging fire since 2010... So I'd
guess keeping a tsunami from swamping a reactor after a major earthquake
isn't water cooler talk at GE.

In light of Apple’s very public battle
 with the FBI over
encryption, John Oliver designed a satirical ad for Apple to help “both

protect data.
The host of /Last Week Tonight/ – who last April famously boiled down
the argument about NSA surveillance to its core issue, dick picks
– said he takes Apple’s side, but acknowledged that the company wasn’t
doing a very good job of explaining its position.
Watch the two-minute fake ad here
It’s the last two minutes of the segment, embedded below.
“We’re barely one step ahead of hackers at all times,” a voiceover
actress explains. “So that when you idiots lose your phone, your
information doesn’t wind up in the hands of guys like Gary.” Gary is a
creepy hacker gratifying himself over family photos on a phone he stole.
Apple engineers are pictured panicking and cursing.
“So if the FBI comes to us and asks us if we can undermine our
encryption without compromising everyone’s emails, texts, and
skateboarding videos, this is our response,” the voiceover continues.
“Are you fucking kidding me? We’re engineers, not wizards,” says an

I can't imagine Apple would fire an employee for refusing. AAMOF the
best publicity in the WORLD for them would be if they publicly declined
to discipline or fire an employee for refusing.
        "Apple’s engineers may refuse to write software to break into
        the phone of one of the San Bernardino shooters if the FBI wins
        its court battle with the tech giant, according to more than
        half a dozen current and former employees."
    Apple employees are already discussing what they will do if ordered
    to help law enforcement authorities. Some say they may balk at the
    work, while others may even quit their high-paying jobs rather than
    undermine the security of the software they have already created,
    according to more than a half-dozen current and former Apple employees.
    Among those interviewed were Apple engineers who are involved in the
    development of mobile products and security, as well as former
    security engineers and executives.
    The potential resistance adds a wrinkle to a very public fight
    between Apple, the world’s most valuable company, and the
    authorities over access to an iPhone used by one of the attackers in
    the December mass killing in San Bernardino, Calif.
    It also speaks directly to arguments Apple has made in legal
    documents that the government’s demand curbs free speech by asking
    the company to order people to do things that they consider offensive.
    “Such conscription is fundamentally offensive to Apple’s core
    principles and would pose a severe threat to the autonomy of Apple
    and its engineers,” Apple’s lawyers wrote in the company’s final
    brief to the Federal District Court for the Central District of
    California.

Wondering if their cert tech can spoof a cert to look like it belongs to
a site they DNS when it really belongs to them and you've never really
visited the site at all.
    TLS Certificate Optimization: The Technical Details behind "No
    Browser Left Behind"
    Overview
    Back in early December we announced our "no browser left behind"
    initiative to the world. Since then, we have served well over 500
    billion SHA-1 certificates to visitors that otherwise would not have
    been able to communicate securely with our customers’ sites using
    HTTPS. All the while, we’ve continued to present newer SHA-2
    certificates to modern browsers using the latest in elliptic curve
    cryptography, demonstrating that one does not have to sacrifice
    security to accommodate all the world’s Internet users. (If you
    weren’t able to acquire a SHA-1 certificate before CAs ceased
    issuing them on 2015/12/31, you can still sign up for a paid plan
    and we will immediately generate one to serve to your legacy visitors.)
    Shortly after we announced these new benefits for our paid Universal
    SSL customers, we started hearing from other technology leaders who
    were implementing (or already had implemented) similar
    functionality. At first glance, the logic to identify incoming
    connections that only support SHA-1 seems straightforward, but as we
    spoke with our friends at Facebook, Twitter, and Mozilla, I realized
    that everyone was taking a slightly different approach. Complicating
    the matter even further was the fact that at CloudFlare we not only
    wanted to optimize between SHA-1 and SHA-2, but also between RSA and
    the newer, but less universally supported ECDSA certificates. Solve
    the "optimal certificate" question incorrectly, and the TLS
    handshake will fail — or get explicitly aborted by browsers that
    have deprecated SHA-1 entirely; solve it correctly, and the client
    and server will establish the most performant, secure connection
    available between the two endpoints.
    Certificate Optimization Logic
    After several trillion requests, we’re confident that our approach
    works quite well for CloudFlare’s customers and their visitors. If
    you have taken an alternative approach to implementation, or have
    found any exceptions/potential refinements to our logic, please
    chime in below. We remain committed to withdrawing SHA-1 support if,
    as our CEO said, "a vulnerability is discovered [in our certificate
    optimization logic] which allows some form of downgrade attack—where
    a modern browser can be tricked into receiving a certificate signed
    with an insecure protocol—and the vulnerability cannot be patched".
    TLS Handshake
    Before your web browser can securely exchange "application data"
    such as HTTP GET or POST requests and responses with a web server,

Why do you say that?
Because I think the so-called 'sharing economy' is a feudal fascist
That make me a Nazi?
Because Uber's financial backers include scum like Goldman Sachs who I
wouldn't care to enrich?
That makes me a Nazi?
Because they spy on you, the consumer of their services, and don't seem
to do as well 'spying' on their contractors about thinks like carrying
guns, criminal records, and so much more that someone getting in a car
with a complete stranger might want to know?
    A formal complaint has been filed against Uber, the car ride
    company, by the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), a
    non-profit advocacy group. The NGO says Uber plans to use their
    smart phone app to access user’s locations at all times, and to send
    advertisements to user’s contact lists.
    Uber, a San Francisco-based company, has become worth over $40
    billion in the five years since it launched its app that allows
    anyone to pay for rides from nearby drivers in 300 cities in 57
    countries. Along the way, it has also gained a bad reputation for
    exploiting its employees and even some customers.
    Last September, users were horrified to discover that Uber was not
    only tracking them but boasting about this ability at private
    parties. The tracking system that the company used to follow the
    physical location of individuals was dubbed the “God View” by
    executives…
That's it! I must be a Nazi because I don't like companies that spy on
people full-time for profit.

Tutanota Introduces Private Smartphone: UnaPhone Zenith
Dear privacy-friend,
we are excited to let you know that we have partnered with Una to bring
to you the most private and secure smartphone: the UnaPhone Zenith. We
at Tutanota and Una believe that a phone should not be your personal
surveillance device, but simply your personal phone, where all the data
remains with you and cannot be exploited. Una has just launched a
crowdfunding campaign to bring the Zenith to life
. As their partner we are proud to let you
know about this perfect chance to get the Zenith as an early bird!
      We call it: the Anti-Google Phone!
The UnaPhone Zenith is the first truly secure and private Android
smartphone without any compromises. It doesn’t use any Google services,
shady apps or strange permissions. With the Zenith you can stay calm
knowing that you are never tracked and that your data is never being
sold. The phone comes with the most secure open source third party apps.
Of course, the Tutanota App is already pre-installed.
We hope you share our passion for privacy and support this project
. Personally, we are thrilled that there
will be a phone available making sure that our data cannot be abused -
not even by the carrier. We can't wait to get a Zenith ourselves!
your TutanotaTeam

Fomenting media about indigenous land rights...
Thomson Reuters Foundation launches Place to put land and property
rights on global news agenda
London (May 16, 2016) – The Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charity arm
of the world’s largest news and information provider, today launched
Place (Property, Land, Access, Connections, Empowerment), an innovative
platform to boost coverage of land and property rights, one of the most
under-reported issues worldwide. The new platform has been developed
with support from Omidyar Network, the philanthropic investment firm
founded by Pierre and Pam Omidyar.
Insecurity of land tenure and property rights is a major cause of global
poverty and inequality and is strongly linked to the realisation of many
development goals, including food security, economic empowerment of
women, and climate change mitigation. Place aims to generate and curate
trusted news and information on these issues, highlighting some of the
complex dynamics related to property rights with the aim of making the
subject accessible to a broader audience.
Place creates the world’s first global news team dedicated to coverage
of land and property rights, and the launch of a new digital platform,
featuring original articles, information, analysis and opinion pieces.
The Thomson Reuters Foundation team will do reporting and will select
and aggregate content, ensuring the site both informs and triggers debate.
“The lack of ownership or tenure is one of the world’s most silent
crises and one with dramatic ramifications. The denial of such basic
rights leads to exploitation and financial instability; it can destroy
livelihoods, create inequality and even foment conflict. It particularly
affects women who are not allowed to own or even inherit land in many
countries,” says Monique Villa, Chief Executive Officer of the Thomson
Reuters Foundation. “Through the generous support of Omidyar Network,
our news will play a significant role in starting a global conversation
on the subject.”
“The lack of property rights is not just a concern for developing
countries,” says Peter Rabley, Director of the Property Rights
initiative of Omidyar Network. “It poses a threat to global security by
putting food supplies at risk, fuelling violence in ever-growing slums
in major cities, reducing opportunity and economic empowerment, and
increasing pressure on the environment. The issues linked to property
rights are a concern for everyone, and this innovative project with the
Thomson Reuters Foundation aims to address these issues by bringing them
into the public domain and sparking a global discussion.”
Thomson Reuters Foundation journalists and videographers in Africa,
India, Brazil and Britain will work with over 100 freelancers to produce
daily news addressing issues such as the lack of land rights and its
consequences, corruption, land appropriation, food security and human
rights abuses. The team will also produce interviews with frontline
thought leaders and compelling micro-documentaries to engage viewers
through visually striking investigative stories.
The journalists are part of the larger editorial team at the Thomson
Reuters Foundation, will report to Belinda Goldsmith, editor-in-chief,
and will benefit from editorial guidance, mentorship, facilities and a
global distribution network reaching an estimated audience of one
billion readers a day.
Content generated by the team will be featured on news.trust.org, the
Thomson Reuters Foundation’s website, and on place.trust.org, the new
platform dedicated to land and property rights.

Let's talk conspiracy Juan, cause I KNOW you're bound to be one of those

"Power Elite Conspiracies" exist but they  are NOT overarching, cast in
stone things with some 'plan' that made them happen. Conspiracies muddle
through by hedging all bets. Any way the cards fall you win SOMETHING,
and over time that something is at least additive if not geometrically
or logarithmically enhanced.
It's up to the proles to take advantage of the hedges that work for
them. Because no one else is going to do it. Even the most perverse
skewed reporting on an issue is better than none at all for too many
reasons to enumerate here.
If the proles can't figure out the media trap their ensnared in educate
them. You'd just scoff. Hella solution.
