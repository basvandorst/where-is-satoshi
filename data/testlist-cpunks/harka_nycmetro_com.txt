I think, a 'collection of words', especially when exchanged on a personal level should be regarded as 'intellectual property' and thus should be protected from outsiders.
The technical means of physically creating (i.e. writing) and transmitting the words are secondary for above all they are thoughts, that are meant to be exchanged from one mind to another. It is too natural a thing to be subjected to invasion.

Here the technical progresses made in eaves-dropping technology come in really handy. Eaves-dropping on, let's say, apartments is these days rather trivial and a great way of collecting voice samples of 'suspects'.
That the FBI doesn't have a voice database or at least access to one, I seriously doubt. Most of the technologically advanced countries use voice-recognition already to monitor phone traffic. The US does, Germany does, the UK....
The system functions 'vacuum-cleaner-like' and reacts to voice patterns (individual voices) and trigger words. If a trigger word is said, the entire conversation will be recorded and the telephone number on either end determined for later review.
There are a few books out there, that deal with that kind of thing. Unfortunately, I only remember a german one: "The RAF Phantom", written by three journalists. But an Altavista might bring something up too...

 Well, not really. It would be severe case of neglegence which is not the same as a mistake. When you drive, you have to prove that you know what you are doing by getting a driver's licence.
 If you are a SWAT guy and some informer would come along and say "This and that person is a terrorist, I know for sure" and you go into that house and shoot everything that moves, well, doesn't sound much like an accident to me...

After all these figure of speech comparisons of federal agents with 'ninja's' I think it's noteworthy, that the ninja's of old were a counterculture themselves.
In fact, they were despised by the ruling class (government) of the samurai as low-lifes and scum of the earth, because the ninjas families would not subdue themselves to 'codes of honor' like the samurai and also practiced different religions (Buddhism) The samurai in turn tried to eliminate the ninja's by outlawing the use of weapons, repressing religious freedom and even invading the ninja's 'heartland' of the province of IGA.
Nevertheless, the subsequent elimination of rights for ninja's led to the opposite effect, the ruling samurai had hoped for: instead of being turned into defenseless kids, the ninja's were now free from any boundaries in terms of existing norms and were
thus much more innovative and efficient than the samurai and their 'code of honor'. That enabled the ninja's eventually to survive all onslaughts and dangers to their culture until today.
OBCrypto: They also used various cryptographic methods and systems to transport messages.

 Absolutely. As somebody a few days ago already mentioned in connection with the CDA, the gov.'s have enjoyed a lot of centralized power so far. A medium like the Net is the antithesis to that kind of centralization. Now all over the world gov.'s try to
 hold on to the "old" way, which _only_ works if things are regulated, censored, outlawed etc.. That is what ensures the survival of centralized and hierarchical structures.
 But they are failing to realize, that people's conciousness changes _away_ from such limiting ways towards more open and natural relationships. The Net is maybe the (currently) most important medium in that process and will be hopefully the last nail in  the coffin of governments, as we know 'em.

On another mailing-list, there has been a lengthy discussion going
on about encrypting the list-traffic or not.
Although I personally agree, that encrypting a public mailing list
is kind of useless I would like to know from a technical
perspective if PGPdomo supports _both_ PGP and plain-text
simultaneously on the same mailing list (if no public key
available, send plain-text, otherwise encrypt).
Also, considering the time it takes to encrypt/sign a message for
each individual user (assuming they use pgp), isn't that too much
overhead for the list-server, when we deal with a few hundred
people and maybe traffic like on cypherpunks?
Any experiences from PGP-Domo users/admins would be greatly

 In> Sweden Gets Wired With Netscape (04/03/97; 8:30 p.m. EST) By
 In> Douglas Hayward , TechWire
 In> STOCKHOLM -- Netscape is negotiating an innovative deal with
 In> the Swedish national postal service aimed at creating a
 In> national intranet covering the whole of Sweden.
 In> Sweden Post plans to use Netscape's Communicator browser and
 In> SuiteSpot server software to offer Swedish households and
 In> small businesses intranet and Internet access services,
 In> according to observers familiar with the proposed deal, which
 In> is worth more than $10 million.
 In> The postal service would use the Netscape Directory Services
 In> product to create a single "white pages" facility covering all
 In> Swedish households wishing to join the scheme, which would
 In> potentially create a national intranet, observers said.
 In> All households joining the network would be given by Sweden
 In> Post electronic mailboxes and a copy of Netscape's
 In> Communicator browser software. The postal service would manage
 In> households' electronic mail services in a manner similar to
 In> the way it manages paper-based mail services. Sweden's total
 In> population is about 8.8 million people.
 In> The email addresses issued by Sweden Post would mimick the
 In> real-life address of each participating household. The goal is
 In> to issue more than 1 million email addresses by this summer,
 In> said Sweden Post spokesman Jan Andersson.
 In> "As far as I know, this is the first time a PTT has offered
 In> this kind of service," Andersson said.
 In> For households without networked PCs, Sweden Post would
 In> translate the incoming email and send it as separate faxes or
 In> print out the messages and send them through the paper-based
 In> mail system, he said.
 In> In addition to email, services offered to users will include
 In> electronic shopping, Web access, Web publishing facilities,
 In> and the ability to set up secure electronic trading outlets.
 In> The service will use 128-bit encryption software and digital
 In> certificates to ensure security.
 In> The idea that each assigned email address would be similar to
 In> the recipient's street address is troubling, said Ian Walden,
 In> a specialist in IT law for the London-based law firm of Tarlo
 In> Lyons. The plan may even violate the European data protection
 In> directive, a 1995 law that is in effect in all 15 nations in
 In> the European Union, he said.
 In> "Is it necessary to make a direct link in the email address to
 In> the physical location? I think it's dangerous," Walden said,
 In> "and I would warn Sweden Post to reconsider such an approach."
 In> Netscape will supply Sweden Post with browser and server
 In> software for an initial fee of roughly $10 million under the
 In> proposed deal, which was agreed in principle early March but
 In> has yet to be finalized. Sweden Post already uses Netscape's
 In> electronic publishing and merchant software in its Web-based
 In> electronic shopping mall -- known as Torget -- under a deal
 In> signed last year.
 In> Sweden Post, which recently lost its monopoly of mail delivery
 In> services in parts of Sweden, wants to become a major player in
 In> the Internet services market in order to compensate for any
 In> decline in its traditional business as a result of the growth
 In> of electronic communications.
 In> "Sweden Post realizes that either it gets into the electronic
 In> services market in a big way, or it loses a lot of business to
 In> Internet service providers. And for Netscape, deals like this
 In> with utilities are a perfect way to overcome Microsoft's
 In> greater marketing power among ISPs," said the observer.
 In> "Netscape believes that if it can to sign up the utilities, it
 In> won't have to worry too much about the ISPs in Europe."
 In> The initial licensing fee would not include the cost of future
 In> software upgrades nor the cost of royalty fees for copies of
 In> browser software distributed to households by Sweden Post.
 In> Lennart Gren, Netscape's director for the Nordic region
 In> including Sweden, declined to confirm that the deal had been
 In> agreed.
 In> Netscape has been targeting utilities and telcos in Europe for
 In> some time. In February, the German national telco, Deutsche
 In> Telekom, said it would promote Communicator as its browser of
 In> choice. The telco added that it would use Netscape's intranet
 In> suite as its product of choice when building intranets for

Not only that but it would create the e-mail monopoly, that would
be the destruction of the de-centralized nature of the Internet
(e-mail being part of it). Just imagine, how easy it would be to
have a few well publicized cases of remailer-abuse and the Swedish
Postal Office therefore decides to automatically block all mail
coming from (and maybe even to) remailers. With the majority of
people having no clue about remailers in the first place (except
what the press will feed them) the protest will be small enough to
be ignored.
That could even be extended to crypto, as you indicate. If Sweden
ever outlaws cryptography, the monopoly would provide a perfect
setting of enforcing such (with the few exceptions of where stego is

Market-driven "voluntary" measurements tend to be rather forced upon
people than anything else. If something is standard then you'll have
to use it because most other people do too. That is the danger with
monopolies of any kind.
This, I am afraid, will happen with crypto-issues in the US itself.
I am almost certain, that Windows 97 will adress cryptography in one
way or the other. If they put in means to encrypt e-mails for
example right from the operating system and independent of the
provider, then this would be the death-blow to PGP. And considering
the talk about "key-management-infrastructure", then this will be
probably the best means to achieve it. In fact, it might not even be
a GAK-enabled system, but one that's easy to crack (propriatory
algorithm or whatever). The civil-liberty groups have no GAK-issue
to talk about anymore and few will understand, why "security through
obscurity" is not good. The majority however, who doesn't care
anyway much about crypto, will use that slick Windows interface and
not worry any further. That would be cause for celebration at the
TLA's and the end to wide-spread strong crypto.
If encryption is outlawed, only outlaws will have encryption...

[1] OECD Releases Crypto Guidelines
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), a 29
country international organization, released on March 27 its long
anticipated Guidelines for Cryptography Policy.  The Guidelines are
intended to promote the use of cryptography, to develop electronic
commerce through a variety of commercial applications, to bolster user
confidence in networks, and to provide for data security and privacy
The Cryptography Policy Guidelines are a non-binding agreement that
identifies the basic issues that countries should consider in drawing up
cryptography policies at the national and international level.  The
Recommendation culminates one year of intensive talks to draft the
Guidelines.  They are designed to assist decision-makers in the public
and private sectors in developing and implementing coherent national and
international policies for the effective use of cryptography. Member
countries are encouraged to establish new, or amend existing, policies
to reflect them.
The Guidelines set out eight basic Principles for cryptography policy in
the areas of trust, user choice, market development, technical
standards, privacy, lawful access, liability and international
cooperation. The key recommendations of the OECD include:
 -- Recognition of commercial importance of cryptography.  The Guidelines
    recognize that cryptography is an effective tool for the secure use
    of information technology by ensuring confidentiality, integrity and
    availability of data and providing authentication and non-repudiation
    mechanisms.
 -- Rejection of key escrow encryption.  The U.S. sought endorsement
    for government access to private keys.  Initial drafts of the
    guidelines included this recommendation.  The final draft does
    not. OECD countries rejected this approach.
 -- Endorsement of voluntary, market-driven development of crypto
    products.  The OECD emphasized open, competitive markets to
    promote trade and commerce in new cryptographic methods.
 -- Need for critical assessment of key escrow.  The OECD Guidelines
    recommend that countries which are considering key escrow techniques
    to consider also "the risks of misuse, the additional expense of
    any supporting infrastructure, the prospects of technical failure,
    and other costs."
 -- Endorsement of strong privacy safeguards.  The OECD adopted one of
    strongest privacy principles found in any international agreement,
    including the obligation to apply the OECD privacy principles to
    crypto products and services.  The OECD also noted favorably the
    development of anonymous payment schemes which would minimize the
    collection of personal data.
 -- Removal of Restrictions on Cryptography.  The OECD urged member
    countries to remove, and avoid creating, obstacles to trade
    based on cryptography policy.  This guideline should lead to
    further liberalization of export control policies among the
    OECD member countries.
Drafting of the Guidelines for Cryptography Policy began in early 1996.
More than 100 representatives from OECD Member countries participated,
including government officials from commerce, industry, telecommunications
and foreign ministries, law enforcement and security agencies, privacy and
data protection commissions, as well as representatives of private sector
and privacy advocates.
The Global Internet Liberty Campaign ( an
international coalition of civil liberties and human rights organizations,
organized a conference for the OECD delegates in Paris in September 1996.
The conference contributed significantly to the OECD's final

     [2] White House Floats Draft Crypto Bill
The White House has released a new draft proposal on key escrow encryption
to the Congress.  The draft (dated March 12) is entitled the "Electronic
Data Security Act of 1997."  The legislation is the latest attempt to push
forward the result the Administration sought to achieve with the failed
Clipper Chip initiative -- ensuring government access to all encrypted
communications through government-escrowed keys.
To achieve this goal, the bill would create incentives for all persons and
organizations to use a government-certified Certificate Authority (CA) to
establish their identities for any electronic transactions.  The CA would
ensure that there was an escrow system in place before it would issue an
identification certificate to the user.
Government agencies would likely refuse to communicate with persons and
entities not using a government certified CA.  Agencies would also likely
pressure others over whom they have substantial regulatory or economic
power, such as banks, state agencies, and government contractors,  to
require that government-certified CA's are used to communicate with them.
Another provision would require any person who "manufactures, imports,
packages, distributes or labels" encryption products to state whether they
use a key recovery agent.
The draft bill also provides that if non-escrowed cryptography is used
during the commission of a crime, an additional five year prison sentence
could be imposed. Another provision, apparently intended to gain industry
support, would limit the potential civil liability of any "Certification
Authority" or "Key Recovery Agent" who obtains a government certification.

     [3] FAA Calls for Collecting SSNs of all Air Travelers
On March 13, the FAA issued a call for comments on a FAA proposal to
require airlines to collect substantial personal information on each
passenger, including full name, address, next of kin, Social Security
Number and date of birth.  The purpose of this collection would be to
facilitate identification of victims of airplane crashes.  The proposal
anticipates that passengers would have to provide this information in order
to board an aircraft.
The proposal raises a number of substantive threats to personal privacy.
One major problem is that it appears to violate the Privacy Act of 1974,
which limits the ability of government agencies to collect the SSN.  There
also appear to be no limitations on the use of the collected information,
creating a risk that the data could be put to a wide variety of unrelated
uses by both the airlines and government agencies.
One potential use of this information would be in connection with the
controversial "profiling" proposals recently recommended by the Gore
Commission.  The use of the Social Security Number would simplify the
comparison of passenger records with other databases.  It appears likely
that the FAA is using this proposal as a less controversial rationale to
demand the collection of personal information rather than specifically
including it in the profiling proposal, which has already generated
considerable public and editorial opposition.

      [4] Groups Urge IETF to Fix Cookies
Several leading consumer, civil liberties, and children's advocacy
organizations have urged an Internet standards organization to fix a
problem with web browser software that allows companies and government
agencies operating web sites to track the activities of Internet users.
The groups say that there is a problem with the so-called "cookies"
technology.  Cookies make it possible to read information on users'
computers and find out where they go on the Internet. Some companies in the
on-line advertising industry use cookies data to collect personal
information for advertising and marketing.
The Internet Engineering Task Force, a loose coalition of technical experts
responsible for the development of standards for the Internet is meeting
this week in Memphis to consider a wide range of technical issues
concerning the Internet, including a proposal to limit the ability of
companies to use cookies.
The proposed safeguard has come under attack by several companies engaged
in interactive advertising and marketing.  According to a March 31, 1997
article in Ad Age, these groups are now drafting a "counter-proposal" to
head-off the IETF recommendation.
In the letter, the groups express support for RFC 2109, the proposal for an
HTTP State Management Mechanism.  The letter further says that
"transparency" -- the ability of users to see and exercise control over the
disclosure of personally identifiable information -- is a critical
guideline for the development of sensible privacy practices on the
The letter was signed by the Center for Media Education, Computer
Professionals for Social Responsibility, the Consumer Federation of
American, the Consumer Project on Technology, the Electronic Frontier
Foundation, the Electronic Privacy Information Center, National Association
of Elementary School Principals, NetAction, Privacy International, the
United States Privacy Council, and more than one hundred Internet users.

     [5] National Research Council Reports on Privacy of Medical Systems
The National Research Council has released a report on the privacy of
medical systems.  The report, entitled "For the Record: Protecting
Electronic Health Information," calls for measures by government, companies
and consumers to better protect the privacy of medical records.
The NRC recommended a two-prong approach to dealing with medical privacy,
involving the revision of organizational practices to deter unauthorized
access to and/or misuse of electronic medical records, and implemention of
more stringent technical measures as a safeguard in case the first prong
proves ineffective.
The NRC also proposes that health-related organizations adopt fair
information practices similar to those contained in the federal Privacy Act
of 1974.  Consumers should have access to a privacy ombudsman that not only
provides such information, but could also address patient grievances over
violations of privacy.
The NRC waffled on fundamental issues such as the desirability of national
databases of medical information and the creation of a unique national
patient identifier, but expressed concerns over the ramifications for
privacy entailed in such a system.  Also proposed by the NRC, although
admittedly difficult to implement, is the identification of parties which
may inappropriately link patient information.  Using the Social Security
Number, the NRC states, is in its current form insufficient to protect the
privacy of individuals.

     [6]  FTC To Conduct Hearings on Privacy, Investigate Databases
The Federal Trade Commission has announced that it will convene a public
workshop devoted to consumer information privacy on June 10-13, 1997. This
is a follow-up to FTC workshops held last summer.
The workshop is intended to gather information on the collection,
compilation, sale and use of computerized data bases that contain sensitive
identifying information, as well as self-regulatory efforts, technological
innovations and unsolicited e-mail.  The workshop will also address these
developments as they pertain to children's personal information.
The workshop will gather information for a new computer data base study
that the FTC has also announced.  However, this study will be limited to
"look up services" which contain personal identifying information, such as
the Lexis-Nexis P-TRAK service.  Importantly, the FTC will not address
computer databases used primarily for direct marketing purposes, medical
and student records or the use of computer credit reports for employment
Interested participants must submit written comments by April 15, 1997.

the privacy of information gathered about consumers by telephone companies.
The recommendations cover Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI).
CPNI is the information that is gathered by phone companies in the process
of delivering services, such as numbers called, length of calls, and times
calls were made.  The FCC is currently conducting a rulemaking on CPNI
under the Telecommunications Act of 1996.
The law limits the use and disclosure of CPNI information:
    a telecommunications carrier that receives or obtains
    customer proprietary network information by virtue of its
    provision of a telecommunications service shall only use,
    disclose, or permit access to individually identifiable
    customer proprietary network information in its provision of
    (A) the telecommunications service from which such
    information is derived, or (B) services necessary to, or used
    in, the provision of such telecommunications service,
    including the publishing of directories.
NTIA recommended that phone companies provide a list of uses for the
information and provide consumers with an opportunity to opt-out of those
disclosures.  However, this appears to contradict the text of Section 702
of the Act, which requires that phone companies obtain prior written
consent before they can share the information and use the information for
marketing purposes.  Telephone companies have been pressing the FCC to
relax that requirement and to require customers to contact them before the
telcos stop selling the information.  Public interest groups such as
Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility and NetAction are arguing
for more consumer protection.

                              Bonn, in April, 1997
     Cryptography proposals reverse constitutional rights
The Forum of computer professional for peace and social
responsibility declare the following to the recently made-public
plans and intentions to regulate cryptography internationally and
Very obvious are the efforts to the regulation of cryptography.
After several tries guide lines to crypto-politics were worked out
at the end of march by the OECD[1]. Almost simultaneously plans from
the United States[2] and the United Kingdom[3] for new
national crypto regulations became public. Further developments
suggest, that also the [german] Federal Government has worked out
specific plans to regulate cryptographic technology in Germany.
On the current level of planning the [german] Federal Government is
considering three variations of regulation[5]:
1. A key-escrow-solution, in which providers of cryptographic
   services have to provide the keys of customers to
   law-enforcement, if necessary.
2. A key-escrow-solution, in which only federally licenced
   providers of cryptographic services are permitted to operate.
3. A key-escrow-solution with simultaneous prohibition of all not
   federally permitted technologies.
The FIfF is seeing herein a serious threat to the developement of
society, that is increasingly dependent on information transfer.
Not only is the protection of privacy now ranking below federal
surveillance wishes, but also the protection of all interactions
and transactions, that happen on electronic networks. This not
acceptable interferance [with privacy] is for technical reasons not
even accompanied by any plus sides for federal investigators.
The planning of crypto regulations make clear not only the complete
neglect of civil rights in our [german] constitution. It is
becoming a symbol for the huge deficits in understanding the
problems, possibilities and challenges of [...] an information
The FIfF sees five areas, where arguments for the damage of crypto
regulations can be made:
I. Crypto regulations as last building block of surveillance
Why does cryptography have to be regulated by law? From the official
side a crypto regulation in Germany is necessary, because it's the
last missing piece to surveillance of [long distance] information
traffic. The law for "Long-distance information traffic
surveillance" (FUeV)[6] forces providers of information traffic
installations to provide the clear-text of monitored traffic to law
enforcement. This can be avoided by end-to-end cryptography by
single users. Since telefone and fax [communication] are rarely
encrypted, a regulation of cryptography would mainly affect users
of electronic networks, who can ensure the postal privacy only
through encryption.
It's underlying suggestion is, that encrypted data traffic of
suspects [of crime] in electronic networks is the norm and can't be
under surveillance. This is not true.
The current laws and regulations are forcing providers of electronic
networks to guarantee a surveillance of law enforcement and
intelligence services; this is already happening[7]. Up until now no
case is known, where the investigation of a crime was made
impossible through cryptography. Nevertheless vague threat-scenarios
are mentioned, to make an increased surveillance of information
traffic more plausible.
In Germany though it's hard to observe an under-development in
surveillance. While in the United States and it's 240 million
citizens 1229 telefone surveillance requests were granted in 1995,
Germany with 80 million citizens had in the same time 3667 requests
granted[8] - per citizen 6 times as many surveillance activities as
in the USA. In 1996 the number of granted requests increased again
175 percent to 6428 [9]. No comparison of the crime rates in
Germany and the USA can possibly explain these differences [...].
In which way these methods [of surveillance] have contributed to
crime investigation is not known, since here a control of the
[surveillance] activities is not done, as opposed to the USA.
Although deficits [in surveillance] aren't noticable, the Great
Listening Attack and crypto law are to open new fields for
surveillance. Through that basic civil rights are increasingly
II. Basic rights are reversed
The protagonists of a crypto law say, that such a regulation would
be nothing new, but only a adaption of [existing] info surveillance
to technical developments. This is wrong.
Outlawing all not licenced crypto technology is reversing current
principles of civil rights. The limitation of postal secrecy is
only permitting the control of sendings. There are no forced ways
of writing, nor are certain languages or ways of expression
prohibited. No law is prohibiting to write with secret ink or to
use any other means to make messages secret. Somebody opening
letters has to do all work of analysis himself - no sender has to
help him with a [correct] letter written according to law. A
prohibition of cryptography, despite all current systems of law,
would throw the law-conform electronic communication under the
dictat of governmentally sanctioned syntaxes. No dictatorship in
Germany has ever demanded that.
III. After all, it's your money....
Electronic networks are transporting not only letters, even the
politicians got that. Using cryptographic technologies therefore is
not limited only to postal secrecy, but also other things worthy of
Those who make crypto laws also want the control over the electronic
variants of transactions, that are currently under special privacy
protection rights. The electronic service law of the IuKDG makes it
obvious by stating explicitly electronic banking as an electronic
service. For users of online-banking, online-work and
online-medicine the bank-, service-, and medical secrecy gets
reduced to the information traffic secrecy [law]. Thus the
information traffic secrecy [law] is becoming a strategic basic
[constitutional] right. A crypto law would not only undermine this
basic right, but many others as well. Such a law is a trojan horse
[for the democratic state] in an information society.
IV. Additional problems in reality
Let's assume, a crypto law would be formulated. How would it be
[constitutional] and would it be practicable? To note is a law to
digital signatures in the IuKDG, that indicates [a limitation of
asymmetric] cryptography technologies. This leads to characteristic
1. A handing-over of an escrowed key to law-enforcement means with
currently available systems, that a unlimited surveillance of the
key-owner is possible, as long as he uses the same [unchanged] key.
This is even in the practice of surveillance an un-precedented
limitation of citizens-rights, which [out-of-proportion nature] is
also clear to cryptography experts and supporters of a [crypto] law:
No one less than Otto Leibrich, Ex-President of the Federal Agency
of Information Technology Security (BSI), publicized, how through
introducing a time-variable in cryptography technologies timely
limits should be set to surveillance[10]. But could the security
agencies have an interest in [such] a lawful technology, that could
not be decrypted anymore, when users could prevent investigation
already through a changed system date?
2. The [available to law-enforcement] private key of a suspect makes
only his incoming data traffic readable, but not his messages to
third persons. In respect to the nature of asymmetric crypto
technologies [...] proofs for an communicated agreement with third
persons to commit a crime are only to be won, if also the keys of
his communication partners are available, and beyond that in certain
circumstances even their partners. The result is a tendency of an
exponential increase of the [circle of] suspects, the surveillances
and the work-load for the investigators. Here is no proportionality
anymore nor effective Investigation.
3. Due to the lack of competent institutions, the federal
government will not be able to avoid using the infra-structure,
that it's currently creating for introducing and issuing digital
signatures, to control crypto keys as well. No law will balance the
loss of trust, when one one side the institution has to hand over
private keys to law-enforcement and on the other hand guarantees
for the security of the digital signature. Would the digital
signature get into the wrong hands, any document could be lawfully
signed. The fear of citizens is understandable, to be [powerless]
to manipulations of federal key mighties. With such a loss of trust
the federal government and companies [that support the digital
signature] shouldn't even bother [to set up the infra-structure].
4. A national crypto law is not able to adress accordingly the
problems of international traffic typical for electronic networks.
To get the crypto keys of a "Mafia Organization", the agencies of
several countries would have to be mobilized. Are the supporters of
a crypto law really serious, that an international co-operation in
getting escrowed keys would function better than the current bad
co-operation in investigating crimes, where electronic networks
were used?
5. Compared to that it's almost neglectable, how such a crypto law
would make harder the life of the software industry. To guarantee a
relation of crypto key and user on the grounds of the law, the
makers of Internet-browsers, for example, [...], would have to
refrain from distributing their products in Germany via the
Internet and instead sell software packages only [in stores] to
persons with ID. Such an effort is affordable only for a few and
wouldn't necessarely strengthen the position of the legal use of
secure systems. When beyond that different and technically
incompatible national regulations were enacted, the much cheered
upon global Electronic Commerce would remain an illusion.
V. A crypto law doesn't make the investigators smarter either
Nobody can overlook this fact: a crypto law can be easily [routed
around]. A legal cryptographic system can be used several times on a
message, in fact, a with an illegal technology encrypted message
could be "packed" in a legal system. Also a crypto law can be
avoided, so that nobody knows: Steganography and other means to use
covert channels hide messages in plain-text files, for example, and
put a veil around the very existence of an encrypted message.
- From the routing around of the crypto law, the federal security
experts hope to actually gain advantages, because out of the circle
of users of illegal crypto technologies, they could win worthy
hints about the organizational structure of the suspected circle of
With the use of steganography such a group of persons is never to
become known [to law-enforcement]. But what would be won, even if a
group of people would be found, that uses the same illegal crypto
system? Their communication would not be decryptable, thus has to
be won through other means. As investigators today are already
sinking in a mountain of papers with protocols of phone
surveillances, in the future they will have to spend even more
effort to investigate groups, who have done nothing wrong but to
use an non-permitted crypto system and communicate incidently with
people, who are suspected of something. Such an effort can't even
be justified by employment-market reasonings. To stamp the users of
non-permitted cryptography automatically to suspects would be
therefore even from an investigative perspective nothing but
- From a technical and practical perspective, a crypto law is nonsense
and un-enforcable. [Some] lawyers though have the opinion, that
independent from the enforcement the law has to be obeyed in any
case. But such a dogmatic viewpoint is hard to balance with a
democratic society.
VI. Conclusion
The FIfF has the opinion, that a crypto law would even more
increase the already not shyly used surveillance of information
traffic in Germany. It reverses constitutional rights and
principles. It threatens drastically the constitutionally protected
citizens-rights in electronic transactions and interactions. It
would lead in practicality to severe additional problems with laws
and will certainly not make the work for investigators any easier.
The problems that come with such a regulation will also not be
solved through law-dogmatism. The severe damage for civil rights,
democracy, but also economical interests, are opposed by a very
thin advantage. With that background, every rational analysis would
therefore have to come to the conclusion, to avoid a regulation of
That the federal government is not doing that, despite
consultations with acknowledged experts over several years, is
either a proof for lack of knowledge or the willing neglect of the
The very similar regulations of the OECD, Great Britains, the USA
and the West-German plans are out-of-sync with the visions of a
global, democratic information society.
VII. Demands
Instead of a limitation of cryptography it is according to the FIfF
necessary to:
1. increase the availability and use of cryptography,
2. not hinder the use of cryptography through limitations or
   prohibitions,
3. make the free choice of crypto systems possible,
4. support the development of secure crypto systems,
5. increase the protection for electronic transactions and
   interactions,
6. evaluate the use of federal surveillance of communication
   regularly, independently and in-depth.

Here is "PGPSteps", a brief installation guide for PGP 2.6.2/2.6.3i for
DOS/Windows. I started writing it, cause it seemed, that a lot of people
were getting turned off by the sheer amount of homepages, front-ends,
150-pages+ FAQ's etc.. All of these things are great, but were usually
only mastered by the most of the determined. The majority of potential
users though didn't want to go through all that trouble.
Hence "PGPSteps", an attempt to provide an easy starting ground, that
let's newbies know, where to get PGP, how to install it, answers the
most important questions and gives pointers to other resources. All that
in a short and easily understandable form, that even not-so-technical
people might be able to deal with.
I hope, I have failed not too miserably...

Last Page: Flying cow sinks japanese fishing boat
Wladiwostok. A cow fell out of an airplane before the siberian coast
and smashed onto japanese fishing boat, causing it to sink. That
reported the German Embassy in Moscow in an internal note to the
[german] State Department.
Appearantly a russian military plane was flying over the Ochotskian
sea with stolen cows on board; the cows started panicking and made
the airplane instable in it's flight - they weren't tied to the
walls. Therefore the pilots used the last possibility: they opened
the back door and moved the cows out of the machine. One of the cows
hit a japanese fishing boat and turned it over. The crew could save
themselves to the coast, where they were arrested by russian guards,
who wouldn't believe the cow story - until an investigation proved
it valid.
A russian official responsible for traffic is supposed to have
mentioned this case to the German Embassy as a strange example for
the terrible condition of russian flight safety. The State
Department would neither confirm nor deny the incident.

That is not true. While the german government may object to
US-escrowed software, they have no problem with GERMAN
escrowed-software. There are currently several proposals on the
"regulation" of cryptography in Germany, which are (suprisingly)
similar to US-plans, i.e. TTP's, key-escrow, and even the
possibility of outlawing "non-government-approved" cryptography.

It really doesn't matter. I do agree, that having a meeting in,

i.e. no shoes, no smoking etc.. To avoid those rules means not to go

Hi there,
I have a question reg. PGP:
If certain parts of an encrypted message are known, does that
compromise the security of the rest of the message?
Example: If I always use a signature file, in plaintext messages as
well as in encrypted messages, could an attacker knowing that
signature file to be part of my encrypted message crack the rest

Hi there,
It probably has been discussed before, but since the shutdown of
Penet and the re-design of c2.org, I am looking for a remailer, that
allows an reply adress.
Since it doesn't have to be high-security, the format of
My mailbox-->Remailer-->Recipient, and subsequently
Recipient-->Remailer-->My mailbox, would be enough.

@_subject: Key Revokation Scheme 
Hi there,
I started thinking about the issue, how to set up a system to have
somebody else revoke your key for you, if you don't have the means
to do so yourself.
The possible case I had in mind was, what if you're maybe a
dissident, you get arrested and your apartment (incl. disks/keys)
gets raided. You don't have any means to revoke the key yourself,
don't even have e-mail in general, and with the "one phone call",
that your hopefully entitled to, you can't really do much...
It might have been discussed before, but here is what I came up
Peter (the dissident) creates a signed key revokation certificate
and a list of the intended recipients for it. He archives the files
and then encrypts the archive conventionally. He then sends the
encrypted archive file to his trusted friends (or relatives) Alice
and Bob, without the passphrase though.
(Note: For additional security, the files within the archive may be
encrypted with A. and B.'s public keys).
Then Peter gives a sealed envelope to his lawyer (or anybody he
trusts and who would know, if something happened to him),
containing the passphrase and the names of Alice and Bob, incl.
their respective phone/fax numbers, e-mail adresses and snail mail
adresses with the instruction to notify them if necessary.
The lawyer however, does not have the archive itself.
Now, in case of an arrest, Peter calls his lawyer (he'd very likely
be the first one to know) and thus he knows, that Peter's keys have
been compromised.
The lawyer now opens the envelope and gets in touch with Alice and
Bob, telling them of Peter's misfortune, and he gives them the
passphrase for the archive.
He also sends them the same information in an encrypted/signed
e-mail. (Note: Of course, Alice and Bob have to have the lawyers
public key and his key must be signed by Peter and vice versa.
Preferably, Alice and Bob have met the lawyer at some point and have
verified his key first hand.)
Thus they know, it was really Peter's lawyer, who gave them the
information, not somebody else, who might have gotten possession of
the envelope...
Alice and Bob, however, do not immediately send out the revokation
certificate, but try to verify the information from the lawyer with
independent sources, such as Peter's relatives, friends etc..
Only if one or better both of them (they should be in contact with
each other too) has/have enough reason to believe, that Peter is
really in trouble and that his keys have been compromised, they
decrypt the archive and send his key revokation certificate to the
intended recipients (friends, key-servers etc.).
Note1: The entire system relies on the trustworthiness of
Alice and Bob and their effort, to verify the information,
before they send out the revokation certificate.
Note2: The described chain of information/verification could go
different directions. Even if Peter's mom is the first one to know,
she could call Alice and/or Bob and/or his lawyer {...}, who in turn
verify the information with others...
Note3: As additional backup for the case, that the lawyer can't get
in touch with neither Alice nor Bob, he could have the same archive
file, encrypted with a different passphrase (which he doesn't know).
If he can't talk to Alice or Bob within a reasonable time period
(let's say 3 days), Peter could give him the passphrase and so his
lawyer himself sends out the revokation certificate.
Note4: In case, Peter doesn't even get the one phone call, but
happens to be in a country, where one just "disappeares", having his
secret keys compromised should be the least of his problems...
But even then, chances are, that the word gets out and Alice and Bob
could act upon it.
Please let me know, if you think, that such a scheme could work (or
not work). Also I'd be grateful, if you'd copy replies to my private
e-mail adress as well, for I am currently not subscribed to the CP

Yes, they should. Nevertheless, if they fall into the hands of (a)
government, I'd consider them compromised and would see to revoking
them quickly.
 In> Otherwise, this all relies too much on other people...
That's the whole point, because you can't do it yourself anymore
(got arrested).
Besides, what I tried to do is find a way WITHOUT relying upon only
one other person. The only one person, who should be able to revoke
your keys by himself is you.
If you can't do it yourself due to circumstances, then there can be
other people doing it for you, but it shouldn't be only one
person, but several. Only that way, nobody alone can revoke your
keys "by accident". :)

Sounds like an idea, although it might come along with a lot of
inconveniences, technically. (I am going on vacation to Hawaii and
forgot to disable the automated dead-man switch and I come back 3
weeks later to find all my keys revoked, for example) :)

IMHO the remailer network needs to be extended so as to place the
risk on (too) many shoulders, thereby reducing it considerably.
The winsock remailer has an "shared" option included, meaning every
regular e-mail account could serve as a remailer (or at least as
middleman). If such an option could be included in e-mail programs,
the danger of remailers "dropping like flies left and right" would
The accounts could be published on a web page together with the
instructions a la Raph's remailer list and the country, where they
are located in. Therefore they could even serve as exit point, for
the laws of the receiver don't apply there. The only problem I see
with shared accounts though is a flood attack, rendering it unusable
for the account holder. So probably middleman or PGP-encrypted-only
are the most reasonable options.
Why not extending the source of Private Idaho to include remailer
capabilities, for example?

Absolutely. When I asked my ISP to implement a remailer in the Linux

Hmm, could a NYM account maybe serve as entry and exit point for a
remailer? That would
- - have the advantage, that the remailer, the domain and the
operator aren't even known ("Anonymity for anonymous remailers" -
my former proposal of usage of "shared account" remailers becomes
an actual possibility here) and therefore shut-downs are unlikely.
With the exception of the NYM-account, which is trivial to replace.
- - make traffic analysis even harder, for alone by the reply block
chain an incoming and outgoing message would "disappear" in other
traffic, not to mention, that the NYM account remailer (and the
attached reply block chain) could be only one adress in an even
longer chain of remailers.
- - encrypt even plain-text messages at least on their way through the
reply block chain conventionally, thereby adding to resistance to
traffic analysis.
- - even out the message load of the available remailers by using
preferrably the remailers with only little traffic for the reply
block chain, yet again helping against traffic analysis of the
general remailer network.

This has been going on in Germany for several years now under the
name "Raster-Fahndung" (cross-reference-search). What it means is as
you write it: even mere contacts to suspected "terrorists,
gang-members, drug-dealers" etc. is enough, to get you flagged as
"suspected supporter of [see above]".
An example of how one could get into that was being presented by a
german civil liberties group:
Let's say, there is a non-permitted demonstration going on in City
A of "anarchic chaots" (the german term for ultra-left-wing
groups). The police installs street barriers around the city and
screens the drivers licences in search of potential demonstrators.
Bob drives up, shows his ID and happens to be believed by the police
man to be somehow affiliated with the demonstration. They might
search his car and will let him go after that, if nothing is found.
However, his name will be put in a central database as "suspected
supporter of unconstitutional groups".
That is enough to target his entire family and close friends with
possible surveillance etc., if the police (or actually the interior
intelligence agency "for the protection of the constitution")
chooses to. Bob will never know of that and although, he has nothing
to do with the demonstrators, his name will be in such a database as
a suspect.
That example shows, that the law can be (mis)used to almost
unlimited surveillance on pretty much everybody to the hearts extent
of the "law-enforcement" agencies. And guess what? They will.

"A ghost goes around in the world...the ghost of crypto"
Such as Marx's line described the general fear of governments in terms of communism, so it may be adapted to cryptography. World-wide we see strenuous work to hinder, prohibit, outlaw free crypto in favor of the surveillance states.
And reality shows, why they can do so: only a fraction of the Net-population is using it.
Therefore it might be time for a wide-spread campaign to further the use of crypto. "Use a cipher...be cool!".
While a lot of Cypherpunks may do so on an individual level already, it will not reach the other 30 million or so. IMHO we need something of the extent of the "Blue Ribbon Campaign", where almost everybody became aware of it and involved in.
On some german crypto-webpages, they have a nice symbol for their campaign against the [german] "telecommunications act": a bug.
Check out  for some graphics (the page is in german, but the pictures speak enough).
Such might be a good way to make people aware of the isues at hand and spread free crypto. The german magazine "Der Spiegel" had last week an "E-Vote" on their web page: "If it were easy enough to encrypt your e-mail, would you use cryptography?" - more than 80 percent said yes. Clearly a call to our code-writing members. If we could initiate such a campaign, that besides giving info on the current attempts to make crypto "surveillance-friendly" etc., also gives not-so-technical users an easy way to use crypto for themselves, then we might affect the current state of affaires much more, than to endlessly rant and rage against it here in our "Use a cipher - be cool!"

Catching counterfeit credit cards
Researchers find way to check magnetic 'fingerprints'
ST. LOUIS, Missouri (CNN) -- Researchers at Washington University here have come up with a way to spot counterfeit credit cards by detecting the unique "fingerprint" on the back of each card. Their solution, called the Magneprint system, reads the millions of tiny magnetic particles, which are unique on each card, says Professor Ronald Indeck. Each magnetic stripe on the card has two important areas. The first looks like a bar code, which contains the account number. The rest is a random pattern of magnetic information -- a signature that is different on every card and impossible to duplicate, Indeck says.
The inventors say the Magneprint system can be used to stop other kinds of fraud, involving airline tickets, currency, and checks.
It's expected to be made available to card companies later this year.

This somewhat overlaps with another emerging possibility I've been
thinking about since the beginning of the DES and RC5-search.
While I am very supportive of the general idea of distributing any
such computationally intensive applications onto the many CPU's
available today, it also opens the door to another potential
horror: distributed horror.
The concept of "The Internet one big Supercomputer" makes sense,
but if _we_ can do it so can _they_! And herein lies the immense
potential danger of undisclosed source-code.
Who can guarantee, that Windows 3.1/95/NT/whatever and any other OS
and Applications with no open source won't employ a client
similar to RC5 of it's own...secretly running in the background
doing it's Big Brother work? The same might apply to the CPU's
themselves, or a combination thereof.
Especially Windows-users are by now more than sufficiently
conditioned to see installing regular "bug-fixes" disguised as
"service-packs" as a normal part of their "work". It would be
fairly easy to send along an application, that does something very
differently than merely fixing bugs...and since nobody can ever
verify the source-code independently from MS (or Intel etc.),
chances are, that it would remain undetected for the general public
for a long time.
The application could even be remotely triggered to cease working
or be deleted by the next "service-pack" to ensure sneakiness.
People might remember the Windows95 Registration-Wizard, which
apparently collected data about programs found on the hard drive
etc. and sent it along to Microsoft to be analyzed by them.
Since things have become that easy, it'd probably be trivial from a
technical perspective to send along secring.pgp, maybe even the
captured passphrase. Now that the average PC is connected to the Net
quite frequently if not constantly, it could do such things in the
background while the user is waiting for his "web page to download".
There's almost no way of telling if the system is closed off from
the user, such as Windows is.
First, there's no source-code. Nobody knows, what the (by now)
probably millions of lines of code actually do other than what's
Second, "looking under the hood" seems to become more and more
discouraged by the overall design and to actually know what your
system is doing at any time is now almost impossible with
Windows95/NT...at least outside the regular user-space.
Point 1 and 2 combined create a totally non-transparent system,
that could potentially be used for many (undetectable)
horror-"applications" such as mentioned before...
CPU's upgradable via software (Flash-ROM), modems etc. add to the
"Mind-boggling" indeed...

"Defending my property" is probably one of the more clear
situations, where it is fairly easy to make a judgement call, and I

But on a more general basis things tend to become more complicated,
IMHO. What if it's somebody else's liberty being taken? How many

about the Shirley Allen Siege, in the first line they mentioned her

People not immediately within the vicinity will have a hard time to
decide, if the media-information is correct and subsequently, if

that immediately provides others all over the country/world with

   Monday October 6 10:08 AM EDT Two N.Y. Banks Launch 'Smart Card' Test
   By Cal Mankowski
   NEW YORK - New York's two biggest banks and the Visa and MasterCard
   groups begin a test Monday to find out how readily consumers and
   merchants will switch from cash and coins for smaller purchases to a
   wallet-sized plastic card.
   The smart cards, billed as a quick, convenient alternative to cash for
   making everyday purchases, are being distributed to customers of Chase
   Manhattan Corp. and Citicorp. Chase Manhattan is the largest U.S. bank
   based on assets and Citicorp is ranked second.
   Citicorp's Citibank retail bank will issue Visa Cash cards to its
   customers. Chase Manhattan will issue its customers the Mondex
   electronic cash product which will appear under the MasterCard banner.
   Backers have said a key aim of the test is to demonstrate that the
   different technologies of the Visa Cash and Mondex cards are
   inter-operable" when it comes down to everyday usage. As one
   participant put it, the aim will be to show that two systems can be
   used over one terminal.
   Participants will also be hoping the smart cards will prove more
   popular than they did during a much-ballyhood test in Atlanta during
   the 1996 Summer Olympics.
   I would have to say it was not as positive as we thought it might be,"
   said one of the people involved in the Atlanta test.
   The person, who requested anonymity, said there was a "Catch 22"
   problem in the test -- with merchants declining to be involved because
   not enough consumers had the cards, and consumers complaining that
   there were not enough places to use them.
   Although the cards can still be used in the area, about the only place
   they are seen nowadays is the Atlanta area transit system.
   Another person familiar with the Atlanta test said that merchants
   surveyed after the Olympics said they liked it, citing among other
   things the added security that comes from not having a lot of cash
   around.
   The New York test has signed up about 675 merchant locations, a
   spokeswoman said Friday. The number represents an increase of about 35
   percent from mid-September.
   The area targeted for the cards is west of Central Park between West
   60th and West 96th Streets, encompassing an area known as the Upper
   West Side.
   A news release in September said Citibank and Chase would each
   distribute 25,000 of the smart cards to customers. Residents of the
   area who were not customers of either bank could get a stand-alone
   smart card from either bank.
   The smart cards work like a regular Automated Teller Machine card but
   contain a computer chip that lets customers load" value into the card
   at an ATM or at a special kiosk.
   As the cards are used at participating merchants, the purchase is
   deducted from the card's stored value.
   For merchants, the sponsors of the test say, the benefit is faster,
   more efficient transactions because the need to make change or handle
   checks is eliminated when the cards are used.
   Smart cards have also been tested successfully in closed"
   environments, such as athletics stadiums or at the Army's Fort Leonard
   Wood in Missouri, and participants have said the results have been
   good.
   The development of the smart card even gets people talking about
   carrying on commerce without any cash at all, although some believe
   that is a long way in the future.
   I just turned 50 and I have trouble envisioning that in my lifetime
   cash will go away," David Slackman, executive vice president of
   consumer banking at Atlantic Bank of New York, said in a recent
   interview. But, he admitted, the volume of cash will probably go down
   as other payment methods win popularity.
   Some proponents say the card industry is moving toward a
   "multi-application" card that includes a stored value feature, a debit
   or check" card component, and the traditional credit card.
   One issue that proponents of smart cards generally shy away from is
   the preference of some merchants to deal in an all-cash environment
   because of the opportunity to under-report income to tax authorities.

   Monday October 6 10:02 AM EDT Millennium Bug Threatens Financial Chaos
   By Nick Edwards
   SINGAPORE - The millennium bug computer crisis threatens a global
   liquidity lock-up that could send the world's financial markets
   crashing.
   With computers and automated systems now dominating global financial
   trade, experts fear the failure of a small proportion of systems on
   January 1, 2000, would bring chaos.
   Machinery installed to make markets more efficient could cause their
   collapse, shattered by computers that fail to recognize the start of
   another working day.
   At the end of 1999, many computers will either crash or start gushing
   out meaningless data because of programming shortcuts taken decades
   before to save computer memory.
   Abbreviating years to two digits did save memory, but set a time bomb
   ticking for the end of the century when clocks inside computers will
   read a meaningless '00' for the year 2000.
   And when the machinery controlling the money that makes the world go
   round seizes up, so too will the markets.
   It is our prediction that it will only take five to 10 percent of the
   world's banks payments systems to not work on that one day to create a
   global liquidity lock-up," said Robert Lau, managing consultant at PA
   Consulting in Hong Kong.
   I don't think the markets have quite grasped the implications of what
   will happen if the entire system goes down, " Lau told Reuters.
   Peeling back the layers of the millennium bug problem is a little like
   peeling back the layers of an onion and the end result is the same --
   it brings tears to the eyes, analysts say.
   Banks will not be able to settle accounts, investors will not be able
   to access funds, traders will not be able to make deals, consumers
   will not be able to get cash, companies will not be able to buy
   materials.
   Computer experts and business analysts are concerned that the scale of
   the problem is severely underestimated.
   Lawyers say millennium litigation in the United States will be huge.
   We forecast $1 trillion of litigation in the U.S.," Jeff Jinnett of
   U.S. law firm LeBoeuf Lamb Greene & MacRae told a conference in London
   earlier this year.
   Taskforce 2000, a body working with Britain's Department of Trade and
   Industry, thinks the cost of ridding computers of their millennium
   bugs in Britain will be about 31 billion sterling.
   In the U.K. it would take the commitment of the entire IT (information
   technology) industry and that is not about to happen," said Taskforce
   2000 executive director Robin Guenier.
   IT experts believe that if everybody in the world who has even a
   modest understanding of computer programming were to begin work
   correcting the millennium bug today, only 25 percent of the world's
   affected systems could be rectified.
   With international financial markets entirely intertwined, curing the
   millennium bug on Wall Street would be pointless if Asia were
   crippled.
   Some analysts think Asia's millennium problem is not as great as that
   of the West because computerization of routine business functions is
   not as widespread.
   But key financial markets like Tokyo, Singapore and Hong Kong are
   exposed.
   There might be less computing power in Asia, but that does not mean
   there is any less risk," Lau said.
   A global survey of millennium bug awareness and preparedness is under
   way at PA Consulting, which aims to publish it by the end of the year.
   Lau expects the findings to make depressing reading.
   One problem is that companies underestimate the problem significantly.
   Once they begin to work on it, their estimates of the cost of
   correcting it begin to escalate. Company directors do not see it
   initially as a business issue but an IT issue. Really it's the biggest
   business issue they face," Lau said.
   On the international foreign exchange markets for example, more than
   $1 trillion a day changes hands.
   Insurance is seen as one solution -- at least in terms of compensating
   firms hit by losses from the bug.
   But insurers face myriad millennium problems themselves and could end
   up being the biggest victims of the crisis.
   Not only do they have to tackle their own internal systems problems,
   their financial market transactions could be frozen by a global
   systems failure, their investments could plunge and the tangle of
   liability claims could be immense.
   Clients have not set aside enough money to deal with the millennium
   bug and the scale of the problem is too large for them to handle
   alone," said Singapore-based Aruno Salvi, general manager of Reliance
   National Asia Re.
   Sorting out who will pay for the damage by the thousands of cars
   likely to be in accidents caused by computer-controlled traffic lights
   that just blink out all over the world on January 1, 2000, is just one
   example.
   But there is a silver lining to the millennium cloud for some, as PA
   Consulting estimates it could see the end of three percent of the
   world's companies.
   On one level the millennium bug is a great opportunity. Some of your
   biggest competitors are going to go out of business," Lau said.

Sometimes it seems, as if the people advocating the

The "just don't work for them if 'ya don't like it"-argument  will
last about 4 weeks...the approximate time a human can survive

In your excitement you might have misunderstood what I was trying to
Implying, that the freedom of an (average) person does not get
infringed by (privacy-intrusive) policies "because they can always
choose a different company" is IMHO plainly incorrect and out of
day-to-day reality for most people.
(Also note, that I am not saying companies don't have the right to
have such policies)
The truth is, that even with proper (college and beyond) education
and sincere effort to make something happen for yourself, it takes
quite a bit to get to a point of being totally free to choose your
employer based on mere policies. And that will probably not change
for most people.

Do you really expect single mothers with 3 kids to have the time to
do it to the degree of being able to _freely choose_ their
employers?? Or even Joe Average, who just came out of College and
has $100 000 school-loan-debt?
My point being, that not everybody is in a position to make
themselves "more marketable" to the point of having companies
begging for you, even if they wanted to. And that applies to most
people. (Congrats to the fortunate exceptions.)

While I am glad for your achievements, you have not addressed my
point: all this doesn't apply to the larger mass of people.
You were fortunate enough to be in the right place at the right
time...one of the founding-members of a company in an industry,
that pays way more than average and thus brought you into the
position, that you're in now. Great...more power to you and I
encourage everybody to try the same.
But that's not applicable to the larger percentage of the
population. Besides, it's a supply and demand question.
Computer-jobs only pay that much because it's a booming industry
right now and there are less people than needed. Fortunate for
those who were/are able to ride the wave.
But if the available work-force exceeds the demand for it, such
jobs wouldn't pay nearly as much as they do right now.
Hence, achieving financial independence to the point of freely
choosing employers would become much harder again.
But this is the reality for MOST people (outside of the
elite-industries) already! Especially if they start out with
student-loan-debts amounting to several ten thousands of dollars.
Add a family/kids to that and you tell me how easy a task it will
be to quickly become independently wealthy.
(Some people will be able to pull it off somehow, most people won't
- - despite their wishes to the contrary. Should they make their best
effort? Absolutely! Will everybody succeed? Absolutely not.)
The background of this discussion is the free choice of employers
(based on their policies). My point is, that for the large mass
there is no such thing as a free choice (of employers), not
necessarely because they're not willing to improve their financial
standing to such a degree (who doesn't want to have more money?),
but because they don't have the time, resources and conditions to
do so.
But even IF you were able to "make yourself more marketable" (as
WHGIII eloquently composed)...if ninety percent of businesses in
the country use the GAK/CAK-feature of PGP 5.5 how much free choice
will then remain for you?

The truth is, that there are many people outside of Cypherpunks,
who get barely through life _despite_ making efforts. They may get
enough salary in their 9-5 job to maintain themselves to a degree,
but not nearly enough to have the complete freedom, that is the
issue here. And to say, "they get what they deserve" (if they don't
have the abundance of dollars/freedom) is rather narrowminded and
out-of-touch with most people's reality.
But these are the people determining if GAK/CAK ever becomes
widespread. If companies employing it would face extinction, because
nobody would work for them anymore, GAK/CAK wouldn't succeed.
However, capitalism doesn't work that way, despite of the few who
made capitalism work for them.

Although my statement was deliberately somewhat exaggerated, it is
not that far from reality for quite a few people I know.
A real-life example:
A single (divorced) mother, 4 kids (3-12 years), working full-time
and making in theory $42 000/year. After taxes that comes down to
$2000 cash per month.
In order for her to be able to work her two youngest kids go to a
day-care-center. Wham! $1000 per month (hiring a baby-sitter would
amount to even more).
Her apartment costs $800/month excluding utilities. That leaves
$200 (+ $800 she gets in child-support) per month for _five_ people
to live on (clothes, food, utilities, school-books, gas for the
car, etc.etc.)
One thousand dollars per month for five people!! And that in New
York City!
She is not entitled to any support such as free school-meals for
the kids etc., because she "makes too much money" (_before_ taxes,
of course!)
What efforts has she made to make "herself more marketable"? She has
been working ever since the age of 16, went 8 years to College (paid
by herself and paying rent at the same time) and now has a Masters
Degree in teaching.
What has it brought her? Bill-collectors calling every day!
She made a calculation and (confirming your statement) came to the
conclusion, that she indeed would have _more_ money by not working
at all and simply going on welfare.
However, that is not a choice she wants to make.
Is she to be called "stupid" and "selfish" because she's poor
despite her efforts???
I don't think so. She, btw., is not the only person I know
struggeling in this manner from one month into the next, barely
being able to even catch up on bills.
Neither does she have a free choice of employers. There is only one
board of education in the City. Changing for a private school would
come with (at least a temporary) pay-cut, that she obviously can't
Since she isn't the only person I can think of, who is in such a
position, the argument formerly known as "If 'ya don't like the
company-policy [employing GAK/CAK] just leave and work for
somebody else" may now be called: "Ad Acta".
... Don't you hate it when the pessimists are right all the time?

Hmm, we all agree, that the government is not somebody to be

possible to "violate" and the consequences that would have. And one
of the worst things you can do is evading taxes. At least when they
clamp down on you. Not something, I'd recommend to a mother of four
kids (that she really doesn't want to give up to
government-so-schill-workers). Jim Choate commented on that already,
so I save further words.

True in short-term. But after 8 kids have been rummaging around in
your apartment every day (even without licence and off-the-books and
all that stuff) you can definitely expect to spend a couple of
grands on repairs in a matter of a month.

As a matter of fact there is. At least for her. She's _required_ by
the divorce-court to live within a 60-mile-zone of her ex-husband
and father of her kids (he's in the City too). For
visitation-rights and all that (i.e. she can't move out of state
without his approval or be charged with kidnapping, if she does it
anyway). A thing applicable to probably hundreds of thousands of
people (women mostly) in the US. And that alone limits one's "free
choice of employers" quite severely.

Talking about freedom at the same time then is an oxymoron and
you're confirming my "criticisms about the free market" (Yes Tim, I
have re-considered my position without changing my perspective in
the end).
Capitalism in it's current form does not allow for individual
freedom for most people (exceptions apply), because they have to
make the money to be free (independent).
If that requires doing for years, what you don't want to do
(working in computers, although you hate them and all you really
want to do is paint and live as an artist but can't afford to, for
example), then that means by definition, that freedom has to be
given up. At least temporarely and as mentioned before, that can be
a _very_ long time for most people (who have been born into the
"wrong" families, for example).

 In> character to turn her situation around.
Btw., I'll forward her all of the advice and suggestions everybody
gave. Thanks for everybodies effort and consideration of the (for
her personal) matter.
Also, (violins or not :)) :
It was not my primary intention to cause tears of compassion for
Janices personal situation (a lot of people on and off the list
have a rough time too to get on in life), but to introduce some
realism into the discussion of "free choice of employers".
Cypherpunks sometimes tend to become somewhat theoretical about
things, neglecting the possibility, that it may not apply on a
larger (real-life)scale.
Pointing such things out I regard as a very important thing to the
effectiveness of Cypherpunks-discussions and subsequent influence.
The argument of an (for everybody) existing "free choice of
employers", for example, should by now be seen as rather relativ, if
not completely negated.
Further it is a social issue of importance also for Cypherpunks.
Obviously we don't want governments "taking care of people", but
desire individual freedom, self-determination and independence
instead. However, as proven such things are possible in the "free
market" only to a limited degree, i.e not applicable by default to
everybody, IMHO.
Do I have a solution? Honestly, I don't and I wish I had. That
doesn't prevent me from seeing (and pointing out) things, that I
don't agree with when looking out the window or talking with
friends, who are in a very different position than I might be in.
If anybody _does_ have a solution, that enables _all_ people
(regardless of background) to become truly free and also provides a
realistic way to achieve that (for everybody), then I'll be more
than happy to listen and to adjust my own perspective.

@_subject: Choices 
Both Monty Cantsin and WHGIII have commented upon current personal
conditions being the result of one's past choices (leading up to
While I agree from a mere causal viewpoint, on a personal level I
would like to point out a few things nevertheless:
We can take as given, that everybody's life is a stream of decisions
or choices. We make 'em to the best of our ability as we go along in
However, having a choice in matters does not imply the guarantee of
making the _right_ choices. In fact, even society acknowledges that
fact by making certain choices available only after a certain point
in life, such as voting, marriage, driving, drinking etc.etc on the
ground, that making such decisions requires a certain level of
insight and maturity.
But there's _still_ no guarantee for making right choices even
after the "magical" age of 18 (or 21). The only thing one can do is
to gather enough information in order to make the best choice based
on available information and conditions _known_ to you _at that
And here's also the catch. By making a certain choice, one does
usually _not_ choose the consequences of his/her actions
consciously! In fact, the possible consequences may not even be
foreseeable, predictable or expected in any way!
One does not drive a car with the previous conscious knowledge of
crashing it and living in a wheelchair ever after.
One does not climb Mt. Everest with the expectation of perishing in
a snow-storm.
One does not start using PGP based on the prediction, that your
key will be GAK'ed at some point.
Let's take the example of Janice one more time (violins for
Monty:)) : certainly her decision to get married and have 4 kids
was her personal and free choice at that time.
But it was not foreseeable nor expectable for her, that her husband
would take off after a while for another chick, leaving her with
the kids and a bunch of bills to pay!
Thus she married him and later did what every wife would do:
supporting him while he went to school instead of keeping the money
for herself as a backup-cushion in case he leaves.
Is that really so out of the ordinary a choice??
But even if one is able to make fairly good decisions overall in
life: you may not have previous conditions necessary to make certain
If you're born into a poor family, who just can't afford to send you
to College, how much of a choice to study will you have in that
event? More likely is, that you'll have to work and aid in the
support of the family instead of going to College.
But are you to be held responsible for the conditions that you are
born into or grow up under?
Clearly not. As you go along in life, one's personal ability to
influence your surroundings, conditions and overall life increase
(with right effort). But to expect everybody to be able to make
certain choices in a certain (right) way, or even expecting those
choices being available, is not based on the realities of life but
a mere projection from _your_ reality onto "theirs".
So is the statement of "screw 'em all" (if they weren't able to make
certain choices for reasons we don't know about). Not only does it
lack basic notions of humanity, such as caring for other people, but
also devalues the human ability to learn and change.
Just because you were young and careless (out of lack of
understanding at that time) or you were born in a slum in Rio de
Janeiro (or NYC) shouldn't mean, that you should still get
"screwed" for it when you're fifty or you now deserve the
dis-respect of society and no chances anymore. You may have never
had them...
While technically it is probably correct to say, that current
conditions are caused by previous actions (different people have
different expressions for that: karma, choices, fate etc.), there's
no justification for suffering and certainly none for watching it
passively and saying "they deserve it", IMHO.
But then this is also a valid choice one can freely make. You just
have to live with the consequences of it :)

But then the same thing will happen as with "censored" web pages.
Mirrors of key servers will be all over the world and render such

You do have a point, however. I was thinking about a possible
nightmare-scenario similar to that: Remailers (as crypto-providers
and distributors) will be taken down in a syncronized effort in at
least the western world. Non-government-approved crypto outlawed
simultaneously. A few highly publicized cases of "violators" who use
crypto anyway.
Enough to scare the other 95 percent into complying.
Once that happens it will be too late...at least for a few decades.
Therefore crypto needs to be distributed and _used_ on a wide scale.
Maybe spamming the Net (once :)) with PGP will at least make a nice
publicity-stunt. Instead of "Adopt your legislator"-stuff it should
be "Adopt your local computer-fellows" to use PGP, Remailers etc..
Those who have the resources should implement new remailers, key
