@_subject: MacOS X (Panther) FileVault 
Panther's FileVault has already come up in a previous discussion, but questions
which I thought were pretty obvious and which I had expected at least SOMEONE
on cypherpunks to pose haven't come up... Sigh.
Are there any whitepapers available on the design of FileVault? Except for
impressive words from marketing droids (AES-128, industry-standard cipher,
) I have seen absolutely zilch on the implementation yet: i.e. is
encryption done on a per-file basis or is rather blockwise underneath the
filesystem layer (ala loop-aes under Linux)? AES-128, fair enough; but what
mode is used for encrypting the files/blocks? ECB? CBC? CTR?  CCM? Maybe Apple ported PHK's GBDE [1], MacOS X having FreeBSD underpinnings and all
What I'd like for Apple to do is step ahead and release the source code of
FileVault for per review...

Ahhhh... So FileVault actually is just a marketing term for the encrypted
disk images! Thanks for the explanation! I just hope my login password can
be longer than 8 characters then.
Do you know whether the source code to hdiutil and hdid respectively its
10.3 kernel equivalent is available? I can't seem to find it in the
Darwin 7.0 public source.
Of course counter mode would be ideally suited for this application. The
question is whether the people at Apple implementing this feature knew this :)
I believe in peer-reviewed source code for crypto apps/features.

in counter-mode XORed together with Twofish counter-mode output, Twofish also
being keyed with a 256 bit value. I sense paranoia here - but being paranoid
myself sometimes I very much welcome this decision! Those two keys are derived
by means of SHA-256 from the DH key exchange for which a 4096 bit modulus.
The only thing I can't see clearly in the diagram is the authentication of the
DH exchange. Maybe this is the third SHA-256 hash which goes back to "User" ?
Hmm.. Does this mean the users have to read of SHA-256 hash values to each
other after the connection has been established? Oh. Right. It says "Readout
hash based key authentication" on the left hand side of the spec. Dunno whether
I like that. There should be a means to cache credentials after an initial
trust relationship between communicating parties has been established. But from
what I understand, this type of scheme is exactly what the implementors wanted
to avoid.
