Even President Lincoln agreed that it was the right of the South to seceed......
The Federalist Papers made it quite clear that the States were to remain
The Federal government was *not* designed for it's own self preservation,
but to preserve the collective rights of the States.
We wound up with our form of government today out of pure ignorance of the
populace.  When was the last time a jury exercised it's right to *not*
convict on the basis of a wrongful law?  When was the last time someone
questioned the validity of our central bank, the Federal Reserve, even
though it so clearly violates the Consitution?  Why doesn't the NRA use the
historic representation of the Second Amendment instead of trying to have us
believe we are some sort of militia?  (In a literal translation of the
amendment into today's English, it would read: Since we don't trust the
military because it could be used against the American people, but we
realize that having a trained military is important for the successful
defence of the States, we will make sure that no one can take the guns of
the populace so they may defend themselves from the aformentioned military.)
Why does ANYONE believe that there is a seperation of church and state?  Why
is foreign aid allowed to continue when it is not allowed by the
Constitution?  (I could go on and on.....)  Ignorance of our history and our real *inalienable* rights has given us the
Government which so many fear today.

That's like saying the Bible is outdated because it was written several
thousand years ago.  If the law must change debate it, vote on it, and
implement it.  Don't circumvent it!  I mean should we take away free speech
because more people lie today than ever before in history?  Or should we
take away our religous rights because of the David Koresh's of the world?
Should we take away the guns of the people because less than 30,000 people a
year die of gunfire?  (less than .01% of the nation!)  Should we take away
the double jeopardy clause just because O.J. Simpson *IS* guilty?

I find it ironic that the greatest peace movement in history is recorded
after World War I.  Nobody wanted to fight any more.  Yet, less than 40
years later entered World War II, a more damaging and far reaching war.
People thought the League of Nations, and later the United Nations would
solve the worlds problems.  But things don't change.  Jews and Arabs have
fought their ENTIRE history.  Americans are arogent enough to believe that
*we* can help resolve a conflict 100 times older than our nation.  Serbians
and Croations have *ALWAYS* fought.  Why should we expect otherwise today?
Because we're ENLIGHTENED?  Are we still not people?
Things today are probably better than they have EVER been.  (At least in the
terms of war.)  Mutually Assured Destruction has kept us out of many wars,
and will probably continue to do so.  So things may get better, not because
we are enlightened.  Things will get better due to the massive destructive
power of the United States.  Unfortunatly, political pressure will keep
America from using that force, and terrorist activity will continue to escalate.

See this month's Soldier of Fortune magazine (who has done an outstanding
job of covering Waco issues) for a look at the connection between the FBI
Counter Terrorism Unit and the Army's Delta Force.  (If this is true, then
once again our government is breaking the law, the Army is not allowed to be
used in the policing of civilians!)

In case you want to see, check it out at:
The picture that is on the page gives enough information for the average
person to go to the hardware store and buy the parts.....
Not only do they HAVE to point out that the information is available, but
also provide it.  *NOW* who is irresponsible?
