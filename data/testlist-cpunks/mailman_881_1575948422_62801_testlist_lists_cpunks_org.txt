   [1]MasTRE writes "After an extended period of polishing and testing,
   [2]Postfix 2.1 is released. Some highlights: complete documentation
   rewrite (long overdue!), policy delegation to external code, real-time
   content filtering _before_ mail is accepted (a top 10 most requested
   feature in previous versions), major revision of the LDAP/MySQL/PGSQL
   code. Version 2.2 is in thw works, which promises even more features
   like client rate limiting and integration of the TLS and IPv6 patches
   into the official tree. There's never been a better time to migrate
   from [3]Sendmail (just _had_ to get that in there ;)."
