There are other three letter agencies in the world …. BND (Bundesnachrichtendienst) is more likely than NSA as primary instigator.

consistent key formats are critical, need to converge on:
- endianness
- coordinate representation x, x&y, x and sign …
or bits to show which of these …. perhaps borrow ANSI method
- hint / indication of cipher suite / curve - text encoding of binary format (ascii)
- text encoding of binary format (utf8)
- human readable format
leaking crypto suite
key should be usable in other contexts besides pcp 0.15
one of several possible text encodings
Others might include:
- base 29 - base 59
- base 4096 (for UTF8 channels)

Works really well in Twitter.  Likely well in Facebook and on web pages.
Looks like Hangul or Chinese depending on starting point in code space.  Base 60 is better for ASCII channels … plain email and human transcription.

Possible, but breaks string compare.  Also adds human confusion in interpretation/typing.
oh … yes.  same point
Yes … code is very ugly,  Human usability is more important ...
oops intended base 58
base64: "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/“
   compact, nice power of 2, human transcription errors likely
base58: “123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz”
    fairly readable, relatively compact
base29:  “ABCDEFGHJKMNPQRTUVWXYZ2346789"
   base 29 assumes lower upper case equivalence, always converts to upper for decode
    (removes  5,S  0,O  i,1,i,I )
   base 29 has the best human usability/readability and is not mangled
   very good for license keys and short sequences
   … 1/2 of efficiency (losing lower versus upper)
oh - thanks, assume you mean RFC1924
base85: “0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz!
    nice shorter encoding.  Not  URL or human friendly, works well for email cut/paste  ‘<‘ might be problematic for web usage.

No … but it depends whats being counted.
Twitter limits transmissions to 140 UTF8 characters. More than 140 binary characters can be encoded into 140 UTF
8 characters.
In any UTF8 capabile browser/mail/whatever - the apparent
length of a binary string will appear shorter even though the
underlying bytes are longer.
That said … such encoding tricks (base4096 or the like) might be better saved for encrypted content in Twiiter or other
UTF8 limited channels.
Public key representation would need to be consistent over
other ASCII limited channels.

Yes…. transcription needs to be readable … perhaps base 27 or 58.
Also .. noticed that UTF8 works as a continuos map to base 52643
Base 64 might be best for QR codes ...

References: <20140114111653.GD3900
ANSI defined (and used by NIST and others) the use of the first byte of
a elliptic curve point representation to indicate if it is:
 - both x&y coordinates
 - compressed with sign in the byte
 - ..just x (guessing on this need to go check)
bit coin may use the same … easiest doc
to find would be in RFCs
However … if the key is solely for an initial DH
exchange you may not need anything.
OIDs suck.  A simple registry would be nice.
You need to know the key type when publicly  introduced … but there are applications where
you would want to be stealthier on indicating suite usage
Not familiar with Z85 … pointer please ...
base85 or Z85 are a decent balance of compression and robustness
for applications like email signatures
base27 would be much better for a ‘id’ that humans read
base16 is really old school
curve naming, test vectors, algorithm usage need work ...
I’m interested …

A joint contribution by the NSA and Huawei just removed the AES-SIV mode of operation from IEEE 802.11:
     Very strange bedfellows. AES-SIV was being proposed in the draft for a key wrap application.  AES-CCM is now the only alternative … SIV is increasingly my favorite AEAD mode.  It is more efficient over-the wire than CCM or GCM and is 'nonce safe’.  Is anyone using or considering ChaCha-SIV?   Nonce-safe is a very nice property - particularly for multicast applications.

Document is not worth reading except for the context.  No reason is provided .. except by others in room that CCM is NIST approved and SIV is not.  CCM is used in all 802.11 hardware, but not for this application, so HW is not a relevant arguement.

Interesting …  the ISO NLSP-C did not call it’self an ‘opinion’, but about 1993 it supported multiple tunnel encapsulations that could be used for anonymity services (  ).  It was derived from the 89 vintage NSA defined SP3-C protocol (  ).

References: Interesting, not seen this before … currently working on something similar with hashing keys for identifiers.  This is largely for the ‘bootstraping’ of devices.
Glad to see SPKI brought up … but I’m partial to it’s partner SDSI intro text.  SDSI/SPKI are a very good solution that gets over the notion of ‘names’ as identity and defines a ‘key centric’ naming.  It inverts the model that a naming authority binds a unique name to a key, to a unique key being bound to possible non-unique names.
That said - SDSI/SPKI has not been adopted for some good reasons … it has some issues.  The delegation lacks adiquate constraint limitations. S-expressions really are not stylisitically a viable protocol in this decade.  These are fixable issues and worthy of more exploration …
Wrong abstraction … a key may or may not be controlled by a person.
Privacy issues here …  discovey and identity need to be separate.
Names are not the optimal construct… what does this mean to someone who does not know alice or perhaps knows several alice’s.  The names are a cute handle in SPKI, but lack notions of binding to other attributes (like a person or device).
Yes … it could.

Yes .. but usually using proprietary routing or 802.11s.
This technology is intended for ‘direct’ peer-to-peer links and is being used for a few applications like phone to TV video streaming.  It’s not really a P2P technology in that one device always becomes the equivelent of a normal ‘AP’.  It makes it difficult to scale to larger topologies.
A better Wi-Fi P2P solution is:   It’s new, but hopefully we’ll be seeing rapid incorporation into products.  For a change, the specifications are free and worth a browse.  The P2P discovery model is intentionally blinded to a degree by the use of truncated hashes of the ‘service names’ (6 octets).  P2P data exchanges are possible pre-association (no connection overhead).
