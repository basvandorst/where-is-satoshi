I believe that they did something like this in Japan several years ago ...
I believe they sensed changes in the power output of the audio and also
looks for changes in the color outputs. The last I read on said they had
limited sucess with their methods.

This is a sucker bet ... more appropriate would be that you bet it will
take longer than X amount of time. Verification would be tricky too.

While true certain small programs may be larger in size; the difference
will decrease as the programs grow in complexity. With the natural stong
point of true object oriented code reusing more code as the program grows
the difference may still measurably be there but will be hardly noticeable.

money in a *relativly* secure way ... good or bad is another thread which I

Very good example ... I think you will find that many programs are physcially coded on a unix box and crossed compiled using something
like gcc or g++. One of the last steps is add the gui interface if required, compile on the native target platform using the compiler of
choice for that target. I have a friend who is coding an OS/2 project and using AIX as the development platform. The project started by downloading some source
code for a unix platform that essentially performed the desired task
studying it and modeling their code  after the source code off the net.
Why reinvent the wheel ?
Very true of games and that is one of the reasons DOS is a popular
platform for games ... direct hardware control is possible and the
hardware architecture is only INTEL x86 ... although the technology is evolving beyond this point rapidly. Another reason for the large game market with DOS machines is simply the huge home market where DOS is the undisputed leader. *       Mike Bailey                     (hm)214-252-3915                 * *       AT&T Capital Corporation.

Interesting idea ...
1st question or thing I would want to be certain of is the stability of the
currency of the realm so to speak. I wouldn't want to bank in a country that
had a weak currencey (sp) or was subject to roller coaster economics.  *   Personal internet account, opinions and ideas do not reflect those   *

I'm feel that this type of banking is just around the corner with the coming
tidal wave of internet based commerce.
My primary concern would be something along this senario ... I open an account with U.S. $$ in a foreign bank who uses francs (don't
flame the denonimation or the choice this is just an exammple ;-) ... a month later the franc loses 20 % of it's value as compared to the U.S. dollar. If I close out my account would I not lose 20% of my money because when the money was deposited it was credited to the account in francs ... and when it is withdrawn it converted back to $$ at the current conversion rate ? Maybe this was answered in the previous reply if so call me *thick* if not call me *paranoid*.
