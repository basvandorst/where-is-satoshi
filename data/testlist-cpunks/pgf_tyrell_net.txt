Hmm. Instead of "vetting" the PGP PRNG code, as Dr. Cohen has been
trying to tell me in private email is several programmer- years worth
of work perhaps I should just write my own version of the PRNG using
the algorithm as defined in whitepapernumberwhatever.
If there are artificial "bugs" to throw off the PRNG currently in the
PGP MIT code, they ought to simply not work right with the code I
write independently and therefore cause a crash or something.
Or perhaps just rewrite the program to use plain arrays instead of
pointers. ;-)

   I use different techniques when different levels of protection are
   required, and I definately don't use the Internet for anything that is
   really vital because of the ease of gaining intelligence indicators
   based on traffic analysis.
So you don't trust the remailers? Is this because you don't trust the
remailer implementations or because you don't trust digital mixes in
the first place?
   I never recommend a solution without knowing a fair amount about the
   specific challenge it is supposed to address.  I typically start with an
   understanding of the general environment, the financial and/or human
   issues, the threat profile, the protection environment, the other
   dependencies and protection factors, and other factors related to the
   reasons for protection.  Once I have this understanding, I make value
   judgements about how much I trust things relative to the requirement for
   trust and other limitations presented by the situation.
Actually, it sounds like you don't use anything that can be used by

   This is called an active location system, and it was originally disigned by
   G.K. O'Neill (The Princeton Physics Prof., Space Studies Institute founder,
   the guy who came up with all those spiffy space-settlement ideas in the
   late seventies -- see Babylon 5 for a picture ;-) -- and the inventor of
   the mass driver, among other things), under the name of Geostar, in the
   early 1980's. It's accuracy was supposed to be 6 inches in 2 dimensions,
   and 6 feet in 3 diminsions.  The FAA didn't like it because they didn't
   invent it, the DOD hated it because they wanted to commercialize GPS and
   they didn't want anything so accurate for civilian purposes. Actually, I (and probably others, but I don't want to argue from the
"it is widely believed" position) feel fairly sure that the government
commercialized GPS in order to put Geostar out of business, because there's
nothing for putting a company out of business quite like the government
saying the'll spend thirty billion dollars giving the same thing away
for free.
It's interesting that they're mentioning the ATC application: O'Neill
was a private pilot and came up with the Geostar idea initially as an
improvement to the current air traffic control system.
The whole thing would have cost less than either GPS or the planned
upgrades to the current ATC system, but the government is willing to
pay an order of magnitude (or more) worth of money to get a system
they can control.

If Alice and Bob are members of a reasonably non-compromised and
free of colluders dining-cryptographers network, with a protocol for
reserving blocks for the transmission of data packets, then if they
both send a data packet in the same block, they can each read what
the other is saying but to the rest of the DC-net it is garbled.
Since what is broadcast is the XOR of Alice's and Bob's data, Alice can
read Bob's data by XOR'ing the output of the DC-net with her attempted
input; Bob can recover her data the same way.

Apps have migrated from Unix to the Mac and the PC before in

Of course, this was not done with graphical programs; everyone knows
that graphics isn't Unix's strong suit, and what it has is so different
from the PC, etc., blah, blah,...
Except that for the past two or three years, it's been WRONG.
One of the hottest games on the PC, DOOM, was originally written in
Nextstep (a Unix variant, and a ghetto even amidst the "ghetto" of
Unix) and then ported to the PC.
I don't know which Unix environment they're using in the "master"
development effort before porting to other environments today.
Given that games usually program close to the hardware, and are therefore the _most_ difficult things to port from one environment
to another, it really makes one wonder why Excel isn't out for

It's a pity that the military has decided that in its zeal to listen
in on phone calls, that national security is an expendable asset.
It looks like the Chinese or Russian Armies won't be any better by
the time they're occupying us, unfortunately.

   From: "Perry E. Metzger"    I exagerate only slightly. I don't believe Java to be secure, in spite
   of the claims. Its too complicated, and it operates in an environment
   who's correct operation is required for it to remain secure. Good
   system design says that you want a system's failure mode to produce a
   secure result, but thats not what Java does.

How would you make Java secure or create a secure Javalike language?
(Secure to your satisfaction, of course).
I don't even play a security consultant on TV, but would removing hooks
into X-windows (if it has them; I don't know if it does, although Ray
mentioned something about how it could open multiple windows with graphics
in them, I think) be a good start?
What sort of interface does it have to the filesystem? I would guess that
a secure language would have its own filesystem mapped to a file of fixed
size in the normal filesystem, so that it couldn't cause disaster by
filling your hard disk.
Does it have that?

You misunderstand. With public key encryption, the proliferation of processor
power and bandwidth, and their funding, there is NO reason whatsoever for the
MILITARY to use an intentionally WEAK encryption system.

   The military is not authorized to listen in to any phone calls they want    to hear.  Otherwise, everyone on the list, including me, would probably    be in some hidden military prison.
   :-)  for the humor-impaired.
I think you misunderstood: if we want a military in the first place
(yes, I realize that's an open question to many people on this list)
it needs to have as much of its communications encrypted as possible.
Without back doors or intentionally weakened algorithms. Otherwise
we're just stuck with a standard conventional force that isn't _that_
great compared to the combined assets of a reasonable assembly of
enemy forces.
I would go even farther: since so many of the troops sent over to the Gulf
in the war there went with K-Mart-purchased GPS receivers that the military
had to turn off selective availability, I am willing to bet that in future
conflicts the U.S. soldier's ability to have secure communications (with
no backdoors or weakened algorithms) is dependent on civilians having access
to the same technology. Because the only way they might have it is if Ma
and Pa go down to the local K-Mart and buy one for their son/daughter about
to go overseas.
(I could add some stuff about GPS vs. Geostar, but I figured I've wasted
enough bandwidth already).

It's probably because of the memory problems that toad's mail computer

   From: Enzo Michelangeli    How could it be worse than with the U.S. of A.?? ;-)
OK... think about Venezuela. It has bad inflation. It has laws against
converting local currency to US dollars on the black market, which is
basically defined as any agency/person/corporate entity exchanging at
a worse rate than the government rate (at least in Venezuela itself;
you can pay your foreign creditors in Bolivars and exchange them on
the open market for twice the official exchange rate); all
government-rate currency transactions must go through a special
currency review board that checks to see if you _really_ need to
exchange currency. It is illegal to bribe this board and impossible to
get a request acknowledged inside a year without bribery (if it isn't
denied because you didn't bribe the members of the board).
Of course, one day the U.S. may be this bad.

Bill, I also understood that the Walkers also leaked to the Soviets
details on U.S. submarine sonar operating procedures.
_Anyway_, my point was, if they can't keep _that_ secret, I doubt
they'd be able to keep secret the details/keys for activating the
backdoor on whatever artificially weakened system they're forced to
use (if they are).

Actually it's licensed from a British manufacturer of sunglasses called

   One of the several points I tried (apparently unsuccessfully) to make is
   that with a program that large, it is impractical to verify that there
For better or for worse, we all must use programs (or collections
of programs) that large or larger: even if PGP could be implemented
in 1 % of the current source code, it would still be running in an
operating system that's cramped in 4 megabytes of ram, because that's
a characteristic of the common modern operating systems.
The operating systems PGP is running in are larger than PGP itself; if PGP is too large to practically verify the nonexistance of back doors,
then there's nothing we can do whatsoever to disprove the existance
of back doors.
...are no subtle back doors - regardless of how knowledgeable or skilled
   you or I may be.  Your "assumption of security" perspective is an
   inappropriate one unless you are trying to get people to use something
   that is not secure. Or unless you're trying to subject a program to a standard nothing
ever written these days is going to meet because it runs in an
operating system that's a lot harder to verify as being secure.
Please note: I am not trying to suggest that there are purposeful or
inadvertent back doors in any of the variants of PC-DOS, Windows, or
the Macintosh OS, or more than usual in the various Unix variants (of
which the details are available on RISKS; of course, Unix can probably
be made reasonably secure if one is aware of the issues involved,
which isn't a bad idea. This isn't meant to be a disendorsement of
   The headers on the postings allow you to ignore them, but in the
   meanwhile, the subject matter is in line with this forum, and the
   questions are legitimate.  You will have to do better than to appeal to
   authority to convince anyone that MIT's version of PGP is secure.
Can you _convince_ me that MacOS 7.5, or Windows 3.1 (the OS I
currently use), or WWG, or OS/2 3.0, or Linux, or NetBSD, is
reasonably secure?
   Why (specifically) do you think so? Because you claim it? Because the
   MIT maintainer claims it? You say MIT is not associated with the NSA,
   but they have historically been funded by the NSA and other federal
   agencies for work on information security.  Do you really think that the
   only information protected by PGP is dirty pictures? Do you somehow
   think that MIT and the NSA are above that sort of thing? All you have to
   do is look at history, and it should be clear that this appeal to
   authority is often used by those trying to cover things up.  If you know
   something about PGPs security that you aren't telling us, don't beat
   around the bush about it.  Come out and say it.  Tell us that you have
   proven that PGP has no backdoors and what method you used to do that.    Tell us that you have hand verified all the code and that none of it
   overwrites the key generation process and tell us how you verified it.
   It cannot be safely assumed that any program is clean or that any one
   person or group is not involved with intentionally subverting security.
   That violates the fundamental principles of information protection.
What OS should I use to do this? Should I just give up on anything
beyond TRS-DOS 6.2?

   More accurately, you cannot prove a forall statement about an infinite
   set by demonstrating examples - but you can disprove it with a single
   refutation, however, your argument is incorrect in this context.
   Since computers current digital computers (and programs) are (close to)
   finite state machines, we can prove many forall statements.  But even
We can prove some "forall" statements; however, it is hard to tell
in advance whether any "forall" statement is one of these easily
provable or disprovable problems.
This is informally known as the halting problem.
   more to the point, it is the job of the person asking you to trust them
   to justify that trust.  If you trust them with a less-than-adequate
   basis, you have only yourself to blame when you get burned. Most of us consider the release of possibly imcriminating source code
to be a sign that the persons involved are worthy of trust.

Why are the arguments on either side so emotional?
Because the alleged possible hole is located in the
random number generator portion of the code.
Random number generation (or more precisely, strong PRNG procedures)
are one of the "hot" buttons of this list in general: no matter how
strong the mechanism is, someone can postulate "a weakness in the
code" that produces "weak" PRN's or gigabuck NSA computers that can
reproduce arbitrary PRN streams. And noone can disprove anything.
Because nothing, really, can be "proved" to be random; it's that darn
halting problem again. All we have are "reasonable" expectations,
which aren't reasonable for a subset of the intended user group.
Okay... sometime this week I'll take a long look at the prng routines
in what PGP source code I have.
I'm doing this in order to keep an open mind, _not_ because I expect
to find anything.
Other than the labeled PRNG/RNG routines, what needs to be looked at?
