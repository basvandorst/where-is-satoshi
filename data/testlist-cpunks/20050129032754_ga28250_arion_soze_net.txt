@_subject: Scientists Work on Software to Scan Arabic 
References: Someone give that man a brain, and a cookie.  I don't live near NY.
The internet has nothing to do with scanning written/printed arabic
He obviously intended to squeeze a complaint about the internet into an
article about scanning printed/written documents.  The reason the
internet is "skewed" is because these idiots want others to "fix" the
internet to accommodate their languages.  As a result, much of the
non-western-language support in software is done by westerners, and so
doesn't work.
