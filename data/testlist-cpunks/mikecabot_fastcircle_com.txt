This is interesting because basically all of Western Europe's IP traffic crosses the U.S. at some point, and therefore creates some interesting ramifications for U.S. ISPs.... how do they respond to demands for subscriber records and copies of traffic?

OUTBOUND traffic is what I meant, of course :)
Although, comedy aside, there's an interesting point herein: even a lot of traffic that you would normally assume would be intra-Western Europe traffic actually crosses into U.S. NAPs -- counterintuitively stupid, I know, but it happens more than you might imagine, especially for corporate traffic of multinationals and traffic inbound/outbound for webhosting companies that are European but in reality are getting their pipes from U.S. ISPs.
The same is true of PacRim traffic too, btw (in some cases, even more so -- a large percentage of Hong Kong to Australia traffic goes through the U.S., for example) -- although of course PacRim traffic is not covered by this agreement.

Gun show denies booth for man selling anthrax recipes
Wed Nov 28 2001 10:20:07 ET
A Phoenix gun show is refusing space to a Nebraska man who sells a book that includes directions for making anthrax! Timothy Tobiason attended gun shows in Salt Lake City where he hawked 'Advanced Biological Weapons Design and Manufacture,' including an anthrax "We have told him he cannot go, and we have refunded his money," said Bob Templeton, owner of the Crossroads of the West gun shows.

@_subject: I hate, I think..... 
Apparently, the EU will be formally making hatethink a crime, although I suspect that this proposal won't in fact get unanimous approval. Notice how the Nazis (oh, excuse me, the Germans) are providing the "legislative basis" for the draft, meaning its modeled after existing German hatethink law.
After two World Wars and 56 years, they still don't "get it". And obviously neither do some of the rest of the Europeans. (Not that Herr Doktor Grupenfuhrer Ashcroft "gets it" either.)

EU considers plans to outlaw racism By Ambrose Evans-Pritchard in Brussels
(Filed: 29/11/2001) RACISM and xenophobia would become serious crimes in Britain for the first time, carrying a prison sentence of two years or more, under new proposals put forward by Brussels yesterday.
Holocaust denial or "trivialisation" of Nazi atrocities would be banned, along with and participation in any group that promotes race hate. The plans, drafted by the European Commission, define racism and xenophobia as aversion to individuals based on "race, colour, descent, religion or belief, national or ethnic origin". Ordinary crimes would carry heavier penalities if they are motivated in any way by racism or xenophobia, or if the culprit is carrying out "professional activity", such as a police officer. Some of the crimes listed are, broadly speaking, offences under British law already, such as public incitement to violence. But the list also a covers a wide range of activities that sometimes fall into the sphere of protected political speech, such as "public insults" of minority groups, "public condoning of war crimes", and "public dissemination of tracts, pictures, or other material containing expressions of racism of xenophobia" - including material posted on far-Right internet websites.
It was not clear yesterday how the law would affect radical Islamic groups that openly promote anti-Semitic and anti-Christian views. Nor was it clear how it would apply to political parties opposed to mass immigration, such as Austria's Freedom Party, Belgium's Vlaams Blok, and the Danish People's Party, all of which have become serious political forces.
The law could potentially cover many stand-up comedians, and even Anne Robinson, who, during an appearance on BBC television this year, described the Welsh as "irritating".
The proposals, which will require the unanimous backing of all 15 states, are aimed at ending the patchwork of different laws across the European Union and establishing a common definition that can be used by all judges. The commission appears to have adopted the most restrictive code - Germany's - as the basis for the rest of the EU.
Leonello Gabrici, the Commission's judicial spokesman, denied that there was any intention of curbing political expression. "This totally respects free speech. It will be up to judges to decide where the balance lies" he said.
The United Kingdom Independence Party said yesterday that it could be targeted by the new rules, noting that the Oxford English Dictionary definition of xenophobia is "a morbid fear of foreigners or foreign Nigel Farage MEP, the party's chairman, said: "I'm morbidly xenophobic about this new country called the European Union, so if that is covered by this law then I'm most certainly xenophobic and I could be extradited anywhere. So I'm going to make sure my overnight bag is packed and ready."

@_subject: Absolute anonymity breeds absolute irresponsibility? 
"Absolute anonymity breeds absolute irresponsibility," [SUN CEO Scott Mcnealy] said. "We need a thumbprint Java card in the hand of everybody in the country." Here's the text and URL of the whole Reuters story:
Sun's McNealy touts Java-based ID system By Reuters October 11, 2001, 12:05 p.m. PT McNealy defends Liberty Alliance project
Scott McNealy, CEO, Sun Microsystems  ORLANDO, Fla.--Scott McNealy, chairman and CEO of Sun Microsystems, said Thursday his long-held belief the United States needs a national identity system has gained a lot of traction since the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
"This is more than a sea change," McNealy said to reporters at an industry conference in Orlando, Fla. "I have not spoken to one person who hasn't flipped a switch to say, 'You're darn right, I want to know who's getting on a plane with me.'" Sun developed the Java programming language, which someday could provide the language needed for a smart-card identification system to deal with computers at airports, shopping malls, research facilities and other locations where McNealy said anonymity could prove dangerous.  "Absolute anonymity breeds absolute irresponsibility," he said. "We need a thumbprint Java card in the hand of everybody in the country." Civil libertarians have heaped scorn on McNealy, but he dismissed their concerns. "I'm tired of the outrage. If you get on a plane, I want to know who you are. If you rent a crop duster, I want to know who you are," he said. McNealy said it would be the job of Congress to decide when people can be anonymous and when they cannot. He warned that the United States faces "a huge efficiency tax" for security if it does not adopt a simple system of identification. "Hiring 50 humans isn't going to solve that problem," he said. McNealy appeared at a symposium sponsored by Gartner, the high-tech consulting company. McNealy also responded to remarks made at the conference the previous day by Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. Ballmer said Sun's Liberty Alliance project, an identity authentication and authorization service meant to speed online transactions, "has absolutely no probability of mattering to the world." Microsoft will compete with a similar service called Passport. Microsoft will go it alone on its service, while Sun is working with dozens of companies from eBay to General Motors. McNealy said the number of partners could grow into the thousands. He said the strength of his system was that each partner would maintain its own customer list and could arrange data sharing with one another on their own terms. "Hertz and United Airlines can work out their own deal instead of going to Microsoft and saying, 'How much do we have to pay you?'" McNealy said. Microsoft believes its customer base of 120 million will make it dominant in the field. Sun is betting the flexibility of its system will make it more appealing to merchants.

@_subject: RIAA Safeweb Ping 
York, NY)
This last one above (216.200.127.174) is a colocated server at above.net in NYC.
call "Triangle Boy", Safeweb just bounces packets around their Likely just an internal Proxy-less netblock.... this is done often for private, non-routable IP addresses within a network. In other words, packets route ONLY in the internal network, routers are programmed to ignore any packets within such netblocks.
It's all true until you hit the colocated box. Then it's all cloaking.
ICMP squelching is why.... you can selectively top ICMP return packets from being sent.... often done to protect the "topography" of a network. If you can't hear the pings, you can count the servers or hops in a network path.
See above... not a phantom, just can't route.
It doesn't really matter..... even if the server is physically in San Jose, which I doubt, so what? The end user connecting to that specific server could have been anywhere -- in the Hindu Kush mountains, for instance :)
They are probably not administrative... they exist to basically make the lives of anyone tracking a lone packet miserable :) Basically, it's just inserted path to hide the origin of the packet.
Email me offline.... I can answer some questions on this, but to really understand it you basically have to understand how TCP works. But this kind of "cloaking" isn't really cloaking, it's just one simple technique partnered with a network that has enough depth to make it look like you're bouncing around from one place to another.
I forget the specifics, but there's an old physics problem involving a black box and inputs and outputs. That's what you have here..... the black box isn't really so big, but because you can't see in it, you don't know EXACTLY how big, or more to the point, exactly what is in it. That's the idea behind ICMP squelching.
btw, this is really a simple defense; it is somewhat easy to overcome, although that doesn't mean that you could actually learn anything useful by overcoming it.
other :) Nothing special at all..... any well-designed network implements this right off the bat, to stop the little scripties from following a trail of bread crumbs. Safeweb DOES do some (simplistic) IP spoofing and "cloaking", but what you see is NOT it....

@_subject: RIAA Safeweb Proxy ID 
For anyone interested, Squid is basically just an HTTP/FTP cache.... similar to what AOL uses, for instance, and many satellite-based Net ISPs (Starband, DirecPC) use to maximize bandwidth utlization.
Black Helicopter alert: Squid is based on an ARPA-funded project called "Harvest".... a project that investigated "harversting" of data across large, presumably public, networks, for archiving and "study" :)
Squid itself is opensource.... if you're interested, check out
This is totally off-topic, but consider this: the way that a Proxy cache works (not just Squid, any cache) is that it stores all of the requested objects (web pages and files, in this case) on a series of local servers. Then, when a user requests them, it serves them off of ITS pages -- that way, it doesn't have to fetch them from the "public" Internet.
Now, what do you have? Yep... a complete archive on SafeWeb's local servers of all pages requested by their users.
Not being a conspiracy nut, I won't connect the last dot.... but you see the value of this to someone like the CIA -- besides an opportunity to create a voyeur-google, you can also control selected pages' contents (be replacing them with your own contents and disabling HTTP refresh of the page through the cache). To get back to the RIAA point, though:
What you're looking at are HTTP headers (what you'd see if you Telnet'ed to port 80 on Safeweb's web servers). Again, this won't get you any closer to identifying the path that someone took to get to Safeweb, and therefore, you cannot identify a target via this type of (The more interesting point would be: can Safeweb do so? The answer is "you bet." The only thing they would have to do is classic log/connection-time synchronization analysis, and that would tell them the connection details of the user in question. But this can only be done by Safeweb or someone with access to Safeweb logs.)

@_subject: Stu Baker on CALEA and the Net 
I've searched for other references to this and haven't found any... I work at a very large ISP and because of my job function, I would need to (a) know about such an order; (b) supervise its implementation; and (c) actively monitor compliance with it.
And I can tell you that we've received no such order or even had a sniff that one was coming down (and yes, we do get served by various LEAs to disclose account details and account contents -- but they have always been specific court orders in the past; and no, no one has shown up with a Carnivore box under the arm asking us if they could plug it into the nearest router port).
In addition to the blanket statement that Baker makes, there's also the suspicion that he doesn't really understand the subject.... what does he mean by "CALEA compliance"? Does he mean archiving packet data (if so, the notion is ludicrous)? Does he mean archiving just email POP3 contents? Does he mean archiving web/ftp space? What about colo boxes?
CALEA as it applies to voice networks (packet switched or not -- most voice networks are packet switched already, just not necessarily IP packets) is really an expression of two specific things: a) transaction logging detail (Acme calls Beta on a specific date and time and for a specific duration) and b) the ability to easily and quickly get copies of the packet stream (the voice conversations and any data associated with them or in them) to a centralized distribution at which such data is made available to the LEAs. But this is a different thing entirely from data IP packet networks.
So is this guy (Stu Baker) just blowing smoke?

@_subject: IP: Beyond Carnivore: FBI Eyes Packet Taps (fwd) 
The info in the Interactive Week article is basically the same info from the National Journal article previously posted here, which leads me to suspect that Baker is simply repeating the same rumor to everyone who'll write about it.
But..... it is interesting that they say "router manufacturers" here. I believe that what Baker "heard" was simply the FBI going out to people like Cisco and some of the larger network providers and people responsible for provisioning NAPs and saying "we want you to implement the additions to IPSEC that the IETF refused to implement".
(For background, the FBI, DOJ, DoD -- the "usual suspects" -- had presented a series of recommendations to the IETF last year that would create "packet accounting" features in IPSEC protocols and future IP protocols.... they were rejected by the IETF, which stated at the time that the idea of creating built-in exploits to a protocol designed for security was counterintuitive. See  for more info.)
Now, it is entirely possible that given the public pressure arising from the 9-11 attacks, individual manufacturers (read" "Cisco") might bow to such pressure, and build-in some of these features into future products AND into future software builds for existing products.
So, I think this is what Baker "heard" -- not that the FBI has any such system in place or would have one anytime soon... rather, that the FBI will re-present these proposals one-on-one with Cisco and a few  network providers, and in effect, get the impact of their previously-rejected proposals implemented to cover maybe as much as 80% or more of the traffic in the domestic US. And besides access to the majority of USA packet traffic, they would have access to some part of international traffic too... it's beyong the scope of this email, but keep in mind that many non-USA NAPs are really connected to one another VIA the USA..... in effect, bug the USA NAPs, and you get access to almost all the traffic from Pacific Rim countries like Japan, Australia, etc. and you get access to small parts of Western Europe also, not to mention parts of Africa and the Middle East that uplink via satellite instead of a wired connection.
An enterprising reporter might make an interesting article out of trying to track down exactly what parts of the IETF proposal the FBI wants (Declan?) and someone could post copies of the draft proposal as first released at ietf.org (JYA?). But I digress :)
