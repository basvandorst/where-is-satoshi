Correction: Happy Fun Ball well predates US military action re: Saudi Arabia/Iraq, and is, in fact, the handiwork of none other than Jack Handey.
One example of his work is here:  >As a public service, I'd thought I'd explain for our
 >foreign (or just younger) subscribers the root reference
 >of 'Happy Fun Court'.
 >The American comedy show Saturday Night Live
 >usually runs 1-2 fake ads per show. Some are better
 >than others. In 1990, one ad showed smiling children
 >playing with their 'Happy Fun Balls'. At the end, the
 >ad ran a disclaimer (American products often come
 >with ludicrously detailed warnings and disclaimers, due
 >to our corrupt legal system). It read:
 >--------------------------------------
 >Happy FUN BALL!
 >-only $14.95-
 >Warning: Pregnant women, the elderly and children under 10 should avoid
 >prolonged exposure to Happy Fun Ball.
 >Caution: Happy Fun Ball may suddenly accelerate to dangerous speeds.
 >Happy Fun Ball Contains a liquid core, which, if exposed due to
 >rupture, should not be touched, inhaled, or looked at.
 >Do not use Happy Fun Ball on concrete.
 >Discontinue use of Happy Fun Ball if any of the following occurs:
 >Itching
 >Vertigo
 >Dizziness
 >Tingling in extremities
 >Loss of balance or coordination
 >Slurred speech
 >Temporary blindness
 >Profuse sweating
 >Heart palpitations
 >If Happy Fun Ball begins to smoke, get away immediately. Seek shelter
 >and cover head.
 >Happy Fun Ball may stick to certain types of skin.
 >When not in use, Happy Fun Ball should be returned to its special
 >container and kept under refrigeration...
 >Failure to do so relieves the makers of Happy Fun Ball, Wacky Products
 >Incorporated, and its parent company Global Chemical
 >Unlimited, of any and all liability.
 >Ingredients of Happy Fun Ball include an unknown glowing substance
 >which fell to Earth, presumably from outer space.
 >Happy Fun Ball has been shipped to our troops in Saudi Arabia and is

If a LEO thinks you've commited a crime, they can bust you, and ultimately
have to charge you with something, or let you go. If, OTOH, you're simply
regarded as a whacko, you can be institutionalized, perhaps forever. Try
convincing a LEO that a) you're not crazed, and b) you don't have to tell
him/her your name. Seeya.
tion will require
So the assholes simply move on to sleeping on the courthouse steps, paying
cash, buying throwaway cell phones from the local convenience store, and
stealing cars. They stole whole fucking airplanes full of humans; they'd
likely not have a moral problem stealing a car or paying a crack fiend to do
it in their stead. WTF, if you're going to DIE for the cause, who needs a
hotel room? If we are to believe the news-holes, alot of the folks behind
this used-to-be/are/will be sleeping in caves anyway.
Sort of sounds like the "final solution to the homeless question"....
Well, yeah, "properly done", in the eyes of some, would probably allow the
cop to scan your smart-card from fifty yards. No "felony stop" tactics
Don't mistake this post as having disagreed with you in any way.....not at
all. Just adding my U$D.02
There's no shortage of people that hate our guts and are willing to die for
the cause.........a long time after we're all dead and gone people will be
causing us the maximum grief that they can at home, abroad, and probably
low-earth-orbit and beyond, as technology allows. If all they could cause us
was nail-fungus or pre-mature greying of our hairs, that is what they would
do. Such is not the case.

@_subject: SIGINT planes vs. radioisotope mapping 
I recall a few years back, a single satellite lost stability, and it pretty much wiped out everyone's pagers, for
a few days. Just my way of saying that I don't have any clue as to how much point-to-point traffic may get
relayed by a bird at some point. I seem to recall that, years ago, the Transatlantic copper traffic entering and
leaving the US was shot via microwave link to/from the US terminus, over a bay, and allegedly there was a NSA
farmhouse on the line-of-site path of the link. The implication being that, yes, they "could" have just wired
around the bay, but instead there was an intentional opportunity for And I'll point out that long-haul comms to submarines are done with RF basically at audio frequencies, via
buried antennas....yeah, they DO use very high power, but aircraft are close and don't have salt-water and
thick earth to penetrate.
And if any of the copper is carrying digital data, square waves are hugely rich in harmonics well up into the
MHz bands, and would therefore tend to radiate better from any above-ground wires between poles, possibly
even roadside pedestals.
And I've seen alot of RF off of traditional CATV coax; don't know if fiber-optic cable systems might ultimately
have any tie-in to the coaxial feed to/from the headend.
