8< [snip]
Peter has made some rather astute and accurate observations.  (I particularly liked his analogy of Bavaria & Texas.  From my
experience, I would say that Bavaria is the Texas of Germany.)
While the Computserve incident in Germany may provoke outrage here & across the Internet, given the culture and other factors, the incident itself was rather inevitable (really).  After having lived
in Munich & Stuttgart, I'm just surprised it took so long to happen.  (Then again, the wheels of bureaucracy do spin slowly).  8^)  I'm not saying I agree with their actions, but I think I do understand the mentality behind the actions.
I would venture to guess that the Bavarian State Police were trying
to enforce the JugendSchutzGesetz (Protection of Minors Law).  These
laws are posted in every restaurant, bar, etc.  As indicated by its title, the law basically serves to protect minors from the evils of the adult world.  It spells out what ages a person has to be to drink beer, hard liquor, etc, and covers curfews and other similar topics which serve to protect the youth.
The Compuserve censorship may be the result of an interpretation or enhancement of the JSG - in that because Compuserve really has no way of knowing the age of individuals who have access to pornographic materials, it is not capable of fully implementing the JSG.  (Although how this differs from cable TV (which shows porno movies and can't controll who sees them is beyond me).
Without commenting on the actions of the Bavarian State Police or Compuserve, I think that perhaps we are applying our standards to an incident in another culture - without viewing it in the context of that culture or country.  (In other words, comparing apples and
FWIW, there are a few differences between the USA and Germany which are related to the Compuserve incident and which may help to understand
why the police performed their actions.  I am not saying I agree with their actions, only that I think I understand the mentality behind the actions.  Anyway, here are a few differences:
1) Germans (and foreigners who live/work there) enjoy fewer freedoms    than we do - including freedom of speech, press, assembly, movement,
   etc.
2) The legal system is different than in the USA.  I'm not a lawyer,    but my impressions were that the police had far more liberties    with what they (legally) can do than do our counterparts here or    in other countries.  The OJ fiasco probably couldn't have happened
   in Germany (and he probably also wouldn't have gotten off).
3) There is no real separation of Church & State like we have here in    the USA.  As a result, the impact of the Catholic & Lutheran churches    on the German legal system & government is significant.  It has also    led the the government subsidizing (ie - providing public funds to)    the churches.
FWIW, the German government (like every other government on the planet)
is ill-equiped to handle something like the Internet and its impact on the social & legal systems of that country.
FWIW, the above is my opinion based on having lived there for over 9 Best Regards,
PS - The rest of this mail contains an elaboration of the points mentioned
     earlier.  They were separated from the summarized info mentioned above
     for those who are short on time or have no interest in the long version.
PPS - Four really neat things about Germany are the BDSG (Privacy Act), the
      mandatory (by law) 6-weeks paid vacation for all full-time employees,
      their sausages, and skiing.  (Their sausages are really great.  You
      might even say they're the best of the wurst.  The skiing can be flakey
      on occasion, though.)  8^)  8^)  8^)

FWIW, while the goal of the cypherpunks in helping to promote secure
private communications by making encryption publicly available on a worldwide scale, definitely helps socially backward countries which have dictators (communist or otherwise), it misses its mark somewhat in the USA.  Personally, I think that in the USA, this is treating the symptom, but not the disease.
Probably the easiest way of ensuring that personal information isn't wantonly distributed by credit agencies or (anyone else) is to update our Privacy Act - which is ridiculously out-of-date and badly in need of
being re-written.  It is also hampered by its apparent lack of teeth.
My personal recommendation would be a law like Germany's BDSG. The BDSG
(BundesDatenSchutzGesetz which translates to: Federal Information/Data Protection Law (aka Privacy Act).  Even better would be a law like the one in Austria (which I understand has the world's strictest privacy act.  (Hooray for the Austrians).  8^)
If the Privacy Act were rewritten to be as strict as the BDSG, businesses
would have a (mandatory) legal requirement to:
o Ensure that personal data is stored properly (by encrypting it, etc)
o Ensure that personal data is not distributed
o Ensure that databases are *not* being maintained which describe the
   characteristics of individuals (buying habits, income, property    ownership, etc) wantonly propagated by marketing (direct mail,    telemarketing, etc) companies.    (Note that credit bureaus still have a function, but they would be    (forced to be) responsible for ensuring that compliance with the    Privacy Act would be maintained.  This could result in better
   safeguards being implemented by the credit bureaus.)
resulting in the following by-products:
o the promotion of the use & implementation of encryption - including
   the possibility of ITAR being reduced or eliminated for the export
   of encryption products
o reduced propagation of personal information
o reduced amount of junk mail that winds its way to our mailboxes each day  8^)
o reduced amounts of tele-marketing  8^)
If pressure were brought to bear on the law-makers to rewrite the Privacy
Act to give it qualities like the BDSG, etc, then this would significantly
help achieve the cypherpunks' goal of promoting secure private communications.
(I realize this isn't the only goal of the c'punks, but its a start).  As the changes would be made within "the system" as opposed to outside of it, there
would be virtually no hassle from the government.
IOW, changing the Privacy Act will probably solve a variety of problems while
achieving the c'punks goal of secure personal communications.
Food for thought.

Verily at 03:05 PM 2/5/96 -0500, Duncan Frissell did write:
Works great in theory, not in practice.  Having worked in Germany for 9 years, I can *guarantee* that the German gov't hasn't implemented the above.  It may have been a good idea (in their eyes, not mine), but it isn't implementable in a democratic society - it bogs down in the implementation phase).  Are you planning on registering every computer system that each person and company has with the gov't?  Most sysadmins I know are up to their ears in
work and are barely able (if at all) to recognize which users they have on their system, and why they have accounts at all (business justification).  This might also get pretty wild when the ISPs get polled in terms of usage.  (Compuserve notwithstanding).  Gathering the registration data will be a bear to implement - keeping it current will be impossible (for the forseeable future).  Besides, this
would cast further shadows of "big brother" and remind former "ossies"
in the former GDR/DDR  & eastern block of days gone by - which they would probably rather not remember.
Also, just because Germany tries this approach (and fails), doesn't mean we have to repeat their mistake in this area.
Actually, it would probably increase market efficiency as they would be spending their marketing budget on other appropriate methods which have a higher success-ratio.  I don't know what the success rates are of mass-mailings, or tele-marketing, but I doubt if they approach 1% (wild guess).  Seriously - what is your first impulse when you reach the phone
and find out the caller is a tele-marketer?  The annoyance factor is rather high for these.  More than likely, this was also the reason that
unsolicited mass-faxing of marketing info was forbidden by law a while FWIW, personally, I think many marketing organizations have gone off the deep end in their efforts to try to be effective (to wit: putting logos
on clothing, in video games, etc; sponsor's logos in Home Pages, 3-5 minutes
of TV commercials every 6-10 minutes of TV (for those rare moments one gets to watch TV (thank heavens for cable TV & CNN)).  8^)
You're assuming this isn't happening now?  IMO, that would be a rather naive
assumption.  Personally, I think that the law should also consider exactly this point.  The gov't should have no more access to personal information than it needs to carry on its job - and we as taxpayers should decide how much access they need to have.
Agreed....But, this essentially means giving up your phone, your credit cards, your house, your car, your job, and generally withdrawing from
society.  Not a particularly viable plan, IMO.  The main problem is that the companies do little to nothing about protecting an individual's
private data.  It isn't any of my business how much money, you make, the amount your home is worth, your credit rating, info about your family (wife, kids, etc), religion, etc - yet, all of these are within
the easy access of many individuals who don't have a "need-to-know" of this information.  If I don't have a "need-to-know" about this info, I
shouldn't be able to access it.
Of course since we are re-writing the Privacy Act from scratch, we can
leave out the items you mentioned & design it the way it should be.

As a brief aside to the current discussion.
About 2 days ago, NPR (National Public Radio) had a short news
blurb about a person who was suing U.S. News & World Report. It seems that his name appeared on a mailing list that USN&WR
sold to a credit card company (Citibank, I believe).
Basically, his main argument was that the information was private
and that the had the right to control how the information was used.
It should be interesting to see how this case gets settled.
Sorry I didn't post this sooner, but I've been very busy with a security assessment for a company in town.

@_subject: DES_ono 
Two brief questions about DES, if I may.
I have heard of a couple of rumours that DES is considered to be fairly weak.  Specifically, the rumors mentioned that there were some questions about the design of the S-boxes and the possibility that there was a trap door which would permit the NSA or other gov't agency to quickly obtain the cleartext.
Another rumour was that the French & Israeli intelligence agencies downgraded
the classification of DES to one of the lowest strengths of encryption
I have been wondering about these issues off & on for a while & have tried to do some research on them, but have come up with nothing which would amount to more than hearsay.  It's tough to tell if the rumours stem from urban legends or are based on fact.
If it isn't too much trouble, I'd appreciate an expert opinion of the two rumours mentioned above.
Assuming the rumours of the weakness of DES are true, which symmetric
encryption algorithms would you recommend which are substantially more
secure than DES (and which are obtainable from Internet or commercial
sources)?  (It doesn't haver to be exportable).
Thanks in advance for your help.

@_subject: Microsoft continues to mislead public about Windows security 
I'm not a psychologist, but I have worked in the Information Security field
for a while now.
When a system is breached or a CERT Advisory is issued, this is a major
embarassment for the company.  The breach (or publicized security flaw)
shakes the confidence of people in the vendor's products.  People are rather unwilling to risk putting their business-critical data on a system which has just recently breached.  This lack of confidence translates into
a loss in sales.  If unchecked or the case if severe enough, this could also translate into a loss of jobs.
If the consumers (or some key major players) put pressure on the vendors to secure their systems, then it will happen.  Until then, the vendors
will continue provide us in the Information Security field with unparalleled job security.  8^)  You would be surprised how bad the situation really
is and how many companies are vulnerable and to what extent (then again, you may not).

I agree with your statements above about firewalls and wholeheartedly
agree that a firewall needs these characteristics (among others) to remain relatively secure.  However, I am I'm not saying that adding
firewalling capabilities would make the system invincible.  I *am* saying that it would provide the system with more security than it currently has and would help to reduce (not eliminate) some risks associated with networking.  Of course, it would be terrific if the vendors would produce Operating Systems which are secure AND usable.  (I think the market will eventually demand this from vendors, but this probably won't happen in the next year or two.)
Agreed - to a point.  The idea is to provide the systems with increased
defensive capabilities - lowering potential risks.  (See above paragraph)
FWIW, I feel rather uncomfortable continuing this thread in the cypherpunks mailing list when the subject at hand deals more with firewalls than it does with cryptography.
I would prefer to continue this discussion in the firewalls mailing list

@_subject: IPSEC == end of firewalls 
I disagree.  I haven't met a system that couldn't somehow be gotten around.
The creativity of hackers is succeeded only by their motivation and ability to put many hours into trying to solve a problem.  Including the word
"probably" was deliberate.  Kerberos was also thought to be secure - 'til it was
compromised.  Software isn't bug-free & design or security methodologies
can't provide 100% coverage.  Hackers take advantage of this and inherent weaknesses in design
Answer is the same as the above paragraph.  I try not to use the word "can't"
or "won't" when possible.  Granted "probably" sounds wishy-washy, but it is frequently accurate.
I disagree here also.  Systems by themselves are fairly useless.  Their
power (and main vulnerability) comes from their ability to network with other systems.  A system connected to a network is vulnerable.  The fact
that a corporate firewall protects the system from the Internet in no way decreases the vulnerability of that system (and other systems) from *internal*
attacks which can be as devastating as an Internet attack.
Including firewall capabilities as part of the Operating System's network
applications would help the system protect itself from abuses from the Internet - as well as from internal.
In the current context yes.  However, a firewall is only solving one part of the problem.  Just as Information Security must be integrated
into every layer of a company (from users->system managers->managers->
executives), it must also be incorporated into each part in a network
(systems, LANs, external connections).

Egads.  Let's take this off-line & stop bothering the cypherpunks folks with this discussion.  Those not interested in this thread
are kindly requested to hit the  key now.  Thanks.  8^)
I re-iterate, any system can be gotten around - and frequently will.
As far as IPsec goes, it is probably just a matter of time before we see the first CERT Advistory (maybe in a couple of years) on this.
Nothing is invincible.
Actually, I was refering to Bellovin's paper.  Surely you don't think
that the bugs that were discovered are the only ones which can be exploited and that Kerberos (or any other software product) is invincible?
I don't.  Of course it is easier to secure one machine that 500 or 10K.  However,
NOT securing the 500 or 10K systems still leaves them vulnerable to network attacks.  Providing the O/S with rudimentary firewalling capabilities helps to increase the security of those systems.  Like many of my colleagues in the Information Security field, I have (grossly) modified/hacked/butchered my systems to provide the system
with some rudimentary firewalling capabilities and the extra security
I needed.  In many cases, it meant taking advantage of strange behaviours of the systems to achieve the capabilities & results I wanted.
Beats me.  They make sense to me.  What part about Information & Network
Security don't you understand?  These are fairly basic concepts.  I can
go explain these concepts either in another forum or off-line via e-mail or phone (your dime, my time), but not here.  This is the cypherpunks mailing list, not the firewalls mailing list.
Perhaps this is where you are getting mixed up.  A firewall isn't just a box which you plug into a network between the company's WAN
and the Internet - it's a capability.  Many "firewalls" are systems
which implement this capability.  The main characteristics of the
firewall are (paraphrasing rather liberally from Steve Bellovin's o The firewall is designed to protect an entity from a particular
   network connection.  Usually, we think of the entity as being
   another network.  In this particular case, we are putting in a
   firewall (or the ability to filter out what we don't to deal    with) on the O/S itself to reduce the risks of potential attacks
   from a network (internal LAN, Internet, etc).
o All traffic from the insecure network has to go through the firewall.
   Logical.  If the "firewall" is a piece of software which is installed
   on the O/S to "filter out" certain network connections, then we have
   "firewalled" our system.
Commercial firewall products such as: DEC's DECseal, Raptor's Eagle, V-ONE's SmartWall, etc, actually provide two levels of protection:  1) They protect the internal network from hazards of the Internet     (or untrusted network)
2) The protect themselves from hazards of the Internet or other     untrusted network (such as the internal LAN)
Implementing a firewall as part of an O/S provides the protection mentioned in point number 2: It protects itself from the internal LAN to some degree.  Granted not as much as it possibly can, due to the fact that you have users & applications on the system which
aren't secure, however, an added measure of protection will be provided to the system.
Perry, (and others who may be interested in this thread) This is my last mail on this thread in this list.  If you or others would like to discuss this further, please feel free to send me an e-mail directly or join me in discussing this in the firewalls mailing Fellow cypherpunks,

Back, by popular demand...
I didn't really want to continue this discussion here, but I received a couple mails requesting that I continue in this thread.  I'm still uncomfortable with this, but I'll oblige.
I don't think this will ever happen.  However, as long as we're dreaming, here's my 2 cents worth on a good start for a secure environment would look like.  It's not complete by any stretch of an imagination, but it's a start:
o Start with a Secure Operating System - Secure Computing's firewall is a good    example of this.  They have done some pretty neat things with Type
o Add in some decent authentication/encryption/verification mechanisms/digital    sigs, etc V-ONE's SmartGate, Fortezza, & Persona would do nicely.  Hand-held    token devices such as the ones mentioned above should work well.  Of course,
   the user interface to these should be user-friendly.
o Throw in a secure method of communication PGP, PGPphone, etc - which is
   *user-friendly* and which helps automate & manage the key-distribution    process (securely, of course)
o Mix in applications which have been re-written to be secure, fast, intuitive,
   user-friendly & interact well with encryption (various kinds).
o Add in a central clearinghouse (don't care where) where the latest key    expirations/compromises can be checked automatically to confirm that    the e-mail you just received is still valid also wouldn't hurt.
o Combine the best capabilities of Checkpoint's (firewall) lower-level    filtering capabilities with V-0NE's upper-level filtering capabilities
   and add these to the secure Operating System's network defense mechanisms
o Add a good dose of IPsec (sprinkling lightly) to secure the pipe
   (kindly omitting the Watergate plumbers)
o Add user-friendly single sign-on capability (Kerberos, et al)
o Mix in heavy encryption with (ridiculously long) keys   (say the number of    grains of sand stretched end-to-end to make a light year).  8^)
o Make all of the above user-friendly & easy-to-implement on a large scale  8^)
Throw the ingredients into a pot & stir briskly.
Like I said earlier, it's just a start & not a whole solution by any stretch of the imagination.  It's probably a nice wish list, though.  It'd sure be nice if it came true.  (If you think the above list is optimistic, you ought to see my Christmas Wish List).  8^)  8^)  8^)

Essentially, adding protective mechanisms that would filter incoming network connections (incoming to the O/S) rendering potential risky
connections harmless or rejecting them.  Steve Bellovin has a very well-written paper called "Security Problems in the TCP/IP Protocol
Suite" which addresses a number of these.  If memory serves correctly
at this late hour (midnight), then it can be ftp'ed from research.att.com
and it is in the /pub/dist/smb directory (or somewhere around there).
I agree with you 100%.  Eventually, I think the market will demand it and
the vendors will have to begin delivering hardened O/S's.
Good points.  As stated above, the systems should be secure AND usable.
True.  However, the systems can be monitored for compliance to Corporate
Security policies and the non-compliant (read insecure) systems can be
quickly brought back into compliance - frequently using automated scripts.
NOTE:  Implementing a high level of Information Security should be as user-friendly, as non-intrusive to business operations as possible, and
as cheaply as possible.  (Yes, it is possible to achieve all three objectives).
I agree with you 100%
Nice posting, BTW.  (And not just because I agree with you).  8^)

@_subject: IPSEC == end of firewalls 
While IP level security & authentication will go a long way to help prevent abuses and reduce unauthorized accesses, I doubt if it will
provide enough protection by itself.  While I would love to be proven wrong, I believe firewalls are here to stay (at least for the next year or two).  A couple of reasons why:
o Node Spoofing will probably still be possible
o The connections will probably also be subject to man-in-the-middle attacks
   (Never underestimate the creativity of people who want to compromise your
   networks)
o Authentication by itself will *not* provide adequate protection against    many abuses
o End-to-end encryption by itself won't completely solve the problems either
   (however, it *does* go a long way to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks o While IP security & authentication helps to secure the pipe between the    two systems which want to communicate with each other, it does not provide
   any security about the applications running over the pipe.     (ie - if you and I have a secure pipe between your system and mine & you
have    a worm running loose on your network, the only thing the secure pipe will do    is ensure that other systems (not in the pipe) won't be damaged as the worm
   propagates out of your network into mine).
   Also.  Which version of sendmail are we up to now?
As far as the future of firewalls goes, I would probably guess that the functionality of most firewalls would eventually be an add-on application option for Operating Systems and that eventually it will be a standard part of every Operating System.  Until then, we have to punt & keep using firewalls.  I suspect even when firewalls are embedded in the O/S, that some type of firewall will still be needed to quasi-isolate a company's network from the Internet (and establish them as one entity) and to contain potential
networking problems which arise when someone configures their system with the wrong IP address (or other type of problem).
IMHO, the first company to include a firewall as a standard part of their
Operating Systems has a real good shot at increasing their market share.  Perhaps the O/S vendors are paying attention to this list & will implement
this (would be nice).  8^)  Of course, it would also help, if their systems were delivered secure - out-of-the-box and we didn't have to spend so much time continually locking them down & keeping up with the latest CERT Advisories.

Of course (Vin already knew the answer).  8^)  To answer the other questions posed on this list, the vendors who are
relatively immune to the above attacks AND are Application Gateway type
firewalls are: (in alphabetical order):
 Digital's Firewall for Unix - *IF* the IP Encryption Tunnel is also used
 Raptor's Eagle
 Technologics' firewall (This is a stretch.  They claim they have encryption,
        but I'm not wild about the implementation) 1/2 a point
 TIS Gauntlet
 V-One's SmartWall
Interestingly enough, the reason the 5 are so robust is that they employ user->firewall encryption to help prevent session hijacking attacks.
FWIW, session hijacking isn't a theoretical attack.  It is a serious threat and (sadly) it's as simple as "point & click".
Another plus for good crypto - it not only helps protect the privacy
of data, it also helps prevent some types of hacking attacks.
Anyone can do firewall->firewall encryption (and most serious vendors do).  The hard part is getting the user->firewall encryption part to work well.  Again, as stated in my previous mail, my company doesn't sell firewalls, so I can call things the way I see them.
As the above list will probably draw the flames of firewall vendors who feel insulted that they aren't part of the list, I think it would be best to move this topic over to the firewalls mailing list (where it really belongs).  See you there.

This would probably get the votes of the first 11 people.  o First 11 people split the money (last 9 get zip)
o All live.

I have met who will actually work your resume & call you frequently
with the status (where your resume is, the type of company, etc.).
FWIW, it doesn't matter if you mention my name or not - I have no vested interest in recommending him other than I believe that people who do a good job ought to be recommended to others.

Good point.  To help establish the honesty, it wouldn't hurt to get personal
and business references.  It also wouldn't hurt to check the BBB (Better Business Bureau - a consumer rights group) to see if there are any complaints against the company.  Ideally, the consultanting company would also be in the BBB's Care program which means that they will submit to binding arbitration in the event of a disagreement.  (BTW, the BBB also investigates all claims to weed out claims made by one competitor against another, etc.).

Depends on the consulting company.  It is also a good measure which can be used to separate the weasels from the good guys.  The weasels will do exactly what you said.  The good guys won't.  Granted that once in a while, there will
be a contract which will have some surprises in it and you - won't make as much money as you were supposed to.  IMHO, this is a part of doing business.
Usually, you will win, but once in a while you will lose.  These things will happen.  Learn what went wrong and take steps to make sure it doesn't happen again.  Then go back to succeeding.
BTW, I think it is the customer's right to withhold payments until the job has been performed to the customer's satisfaction.
If you have the money to spend, this may be a good idea.  Personally, I would tend to separate IT consultants from InfoSec consultants.   InfoSec is a highly specialized field & seasoned InfoSec Officers don't exactly grow on trees (as companies who don't have one and are trying desparately
to find one will testify).  Seasoned InfoSec Officers who are consulting for customers are even rarer, but I would rather have that to have the
security of my corporation depend on an IT consultant who has never had any experience working as an Information Security Officer (who has successfully implemented Information Security in a real business environment).  There is no substitute for experience, IMHO.
Food for thought.

Depends on how their telco's tariffs are set up.  Here in Indiana,
we have a monopoly called "Ameritech" who, out of the kindness of their hearts, charges ***per-minute*** ISDN rates.  Expect costs of over $600/month for a permament connection (one line) to the Internet.  Beverly Hills High School *might* be able to afford it.
Most other places can't.  Best Regards,

A few brief comments if I may:
To Mormons:
First, Mormonism has nothing to do with cryptography & therefore, has
 no place on this list.  Second, CP is not what I would consider to be an appropriate atmosphere
 for proselytizing.  To Non-Mormons:
First, Mormonism (or any other religion for that matter) has nothing to
 do with cryptography & hence has no place on this list.  Let's stick to  the subject, please.
Last, but not least, I think this list has some great material and offers
tremendous food for thought.  However, I for one would get a lot more out of this list if the Signal to Noise ratio were a little better.  Personally,
I find that the petty personal attacks and profanity detract from the subject at hand and tend to reduce the author's credibility.  Food for thought.

I beg to disagree.
Tools, like checklists, are ok as far as a memory jogger goes (to make sure that you haven't overlooked something) but there is no way they can replace an assessment or audit by a seasoned Information Security Officer or professional.  ISOs have eyes, ears, fingers, and a mind.
Tools don't.  Further, assessments & audits require a mindset - usually  based on experience.  A tool in the hands of an inexperienced person (be they consultant, or whatever) will more than likely result in major vulnerabilities being overlooked.  There is no way a tool or checklist can have every possibility on it. (They don't make laptop hard drives big enough)  8^)  As Murphy's Law goes, the vulnerability that isn't mentioned in the tool will be the one that a hacker will use to crack the systems and start peeling the corporation like a grape.
Frequently, a reason people buy these tools are that they feel that the tools are more cost-effective than bringing in a consultant for
the engagement.  Their reasons for doing this are based on the fears
that that the consultant's fee will be too high, and that when the consultant leaves, so does the knowledge he used to perform the assessment.  In many cases, these fears are justified.  (There are
exceptions, however).
The solutions to the above-mentioned problems are:
o Shop around.  Find out which consultants are qualified and what    they charge.
o Make sure the consultant caps his cost.  You should know the maximum
   price tag associated with the consulting engagement BEFORE the    consultant walks in the front door.  This helps to avoid having the
   consultant camp on your doorstep at $XXX dollars per hour for days,
   weeks, or months on end.
o Check the consultants to see if they have ever worked as an Information
   Security Officer.  (Would you want to have eye surgery performed by    someone who read a book about it, or by someone who had is experienced
   at the trade.  IMHO, supplying textbook answers to non-textbook    corporations is for the birds.
o If the consultant is worth anything at all, they will walk the customer
   through the engagement (before the engagement is over) and TEACH them
   how to become self-sufficient in the areas of InfoSec which were part
   of the engagement.  (Sounds counter-productive for business, but the    word-of-mouth references are worth it.  It is also more honest than
   milking the client as some people do.  When the consultant leaves the    site, the customer should know what the consultant did, and be able to    follow the consultant's train-of-thought that led him to the recommend
   the particular solutions that he did.
o Last, but not least, it also wouldn't hurt if they were professional    enough to be a member of a consumer protection group (such as the    Better Business Bureau, etc).  This helps to keep the good guys    honest and helps customers differentiate between the professionals    and those who are out for a quick buck or just learned how to spell
   Information Security.
Food for thought.

@_subject: WinKrypt 
Out of curiosity, is anyone familiar with WinKrypt by Syncronsys?
I picked up a copy & there is no mention in the documentation which
encryption algorithm it uses & what the key lengths are. FWIW, my impression is that the documentation seems to deliberately avoid
mentioning the algorithm/key lengths.  Hmmmm.  (food for thought)
I was curious how it compares to McAfee's PC Crypto which uses 40-bit DES or 160-bit Blowfish (user-chooses) & other PC/laptop
encryption products.  BTW, I would also appreciate your input on any crypto products which you believe to be robust, easy-to-use & secure.  (I know I can only have 2 out of 3, but it's worth a try anyway).  8^)  Please send marketing info to me directly at: frankw at in.net and **NOT** to the entire mailing list.
(BTW, I mentioned WinKrypt & PCcrypo because they are the only
two which are available at many computer stores as COTS s/w).
TIA for your help.
