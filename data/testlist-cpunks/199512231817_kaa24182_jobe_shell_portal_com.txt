@_subject: AWARD: CHRISTMAS NET SCROOGE - AT&T & NETSCAPE?? 
My dearest Perry. I am not Fred.  I am not he.  He is not me. Got it??  We aren't even in
the same category or the same country.  Fred's an American, and I am not. Scary, isn't it??  A non-American ...
Oh ... and a Happy Ho Ho to ya, Perry.  My own best wishes. (just in case you didn't get my email, which wished the same, I mean).
And _none_ of this changes the fact that AT&T and Netscape are my personal nominees for the "Christmas Net Scrooge" award.  Anyone willing to second, that??
Alice de 'nonymous ...                                                 ...just another one of those...
