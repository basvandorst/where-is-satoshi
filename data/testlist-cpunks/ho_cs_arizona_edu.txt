Depending on what you think of the strength of those algorithms, the 512-bit
mod p system may not be strong enough.
The *strength* of 512-bit mod p DH systems is only about 56 bits.  You need
1024-bit primes for a *strength* of 80 bits.
In contrast, the 155-bit elliptic curve in the Photuris draft has a
strength of about 76 bits.

If you are willing to accept that in all likelihood, one year from
now, some group will announce that can "crack" all key exchanges that
using the published modulus, then sure, call it sufficient.  There is
certainly precedent; it was my understanding that Sun did not change
their SecureRPC modulus when informed of LaMacchia and Odlyzko's work.
