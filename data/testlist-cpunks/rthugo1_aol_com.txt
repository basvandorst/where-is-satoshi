 Oh yeah, Einstein.......Its the fault of Bush and those EEEEVVVVVVIIIILLLL Republicans, once again!!
Get a grip, dude........this is no time for political rhetoric either!
As far as the interpretation of the First Amendment, I wouldn't expect a socialist to understand the concept of FREEDOM!
Scary thought, huh Stalin!

 I'm not calling in question their right to publish; what i'm saying that
 this crap was going on for years, and nobody cared.
 BTW, if you look at the First Ammendment protections closer, they are not
 guaranteeing absolute right of free speech.  Learn the American law before
 you invoke it to defend your point of view.
 I'm tired of absolutists who cannot see that there's no such thing as
 absolute good or absolute evil.  Speech can be very dangerous.  This is
 a conflict of ideologies, not nations or religions.  What do you think is
 ideology - if not speech?  How do you suppress ideology if you let it
 spread unhampered?   Violence is bad? Vote for dissolution of police, if you _really_ mean
 that. But don't take the "my hands is clean" high moral ground.  It is
 _your_ guilt, too, for being lazy to learn what is going on, and failing
 to elect a goverment with a clue, not the bumbling idiot with a Texan
 accent and vocabulary of a fifteen-years-old.
 That site was spreading lies for a long time and is well-known in Russia
 as an example of American hypocrisy.  I was reminded of it when i looked
 at today's very sarcastic piece by one poplular TV commentator (Mike
 Solovyev, the anchor of "Odnako" ("But..") prime-time daily show watched
 by a hundred million people).
 [Transcript follows]
    ...Besides, Shamil Basaev is not only a cannibal, but also a very
    keen politologist making in his cave precise analysis of political
    situation.
    The web-site Kavkaz.org published a special message from Shamil
    Basaev regarding the air attacks on Washington and New-York. Mr.
    Basaev says that "Russia is behind this terrorist attack. The goal
    of this attack is to undermine might of USA, discredit the idea of
    the national anti-missile defense initiative, and cause USA to
    lose its status of super-power."
    Chechen politologists are wishing to provoke clash of America and
    Russia: just for a second imagine that everyone believed this
    Chechen propaganda about "hand of Moscow" - what should be the
    answer from the other side of the ocean?  You know.
        [allusion to the nuclear war, for those unfamiliar with
         Soviet idiomas -- avg].
    After what happened, the Western authorities should've knocked
    that site down, it is physically located in the America, and
    change their view of Chechen propaganda in general.  Because
    otherwise it seems that bin Laden is a cannibal, with any means
    good to get him down, but his Chechen comrades-in-arms still need
    delicacy and respect.  This is the message we get by watching this
    site staying up after September 11th.
    ...
    This Wednesday I expressed concern that after the initial shock
    they'll talk, talk, and forget the whole thing - you know, deeds
    are forgettable, body's fattening.  But now it looks like
    everything is funnier.  To forget something you need to learn
    something first. Judging by dithering of various officials they
    didn't learn anything, so they have nothing to forget.

 Here's how America looks from outside.  A bunch of incompetents and
 hypocrites.
 And i am tired of telling my Russian correspondents to stuff their "they
 asked for it" postures you know where.  Because i know that Americans are
 not really hypocritic, just terribly ignorant.
