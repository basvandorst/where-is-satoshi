I find nothing wrong with plinking. Hell, I'm from Montana--we used to
go shooting all the time. But when the shooting was done, the guns were
put away. What I find disturbing is that a child is taking it to school,
or just carrying it around. I say that any parent who thinks their child
is mature enough to carry a gun for non-recreational reasons is less
mature than the child. In fact, I'd go so far as to say they are a
danger to their own children.
I guess I don't really have to worry too much, though. It is illegal for
children to possess such items publicly, and any parent who condones it
is simply breaking the law. I don't blame the child, I blame the moronic
parent who let's it happen.
