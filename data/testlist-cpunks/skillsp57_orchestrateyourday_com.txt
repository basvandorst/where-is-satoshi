(so is corned beef if you've never tried it). there's a tiny restaurant
this image of silke stoddard's knitting is burned into my mind and tatooed on my heart. she's amazing. i am blocking my two latest projects today and will show them tomorrow. simple is always prettiest to me. it was super delicious. i am so grateful for quiet time with the scriptures.
pps- our topic of convo for the night was this article from the wall street journal.
i am excited about my new running shoes.
4. i don't worry about a little "creative clutter" in cate's room. i say, a good dress up/ barbie mess day better than watching tv all afternoon, right? pretty soon i will just put my 'kerchief on again and go to town. (yes, that is what cate's room looks like again, just over a month after the big clean. i tell you, i'm fighting a losing battle with that girl). does that answer your question, mary? i hope it helps! wink.
i have always dreamed of going to ireland, (and scotland too- mccaleb), to research our family history, and to see the green grass in real life.

we are happily enjoying being able to play outside again. she's cute
good news! time for a new spring look...
we ate corned beef and cabbage with irish soda bread last night in preparation for the day of the irish.
