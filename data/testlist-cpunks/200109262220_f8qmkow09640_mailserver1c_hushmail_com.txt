September 26, 2001  Bush's New Surveillance Proposals Could Bring Information Overload
By TED BRIDIS and GARY FIELDS Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
Under another proposal being considered Tuesday night, all of the enhanced surveillance capabilities that the bill would give law-enforcement personnel would phase out after December 2003. Negotiators from both sides were still weighing that idea, participants said. Mr. Ashcroft Tuesday testified before a Senate panel that he opposed any "automatic sunset" of the proposed legislation.
By not allowing an automatic sunset Ashcroft says we intend to keep the country on a permanent war footing and permanently curtail 4th Amendment freedoms.  SS indeed!
"It is seldom that liberty of any kind is lost all at once."
                                                       -Hume If the leglislation passes as Ashcroft wants this may be one of those times...
