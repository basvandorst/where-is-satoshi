@_subject: [NOISE] labelling requirement in EDSA 1997 
One of the more disturbing pieces of the Electronic Data Security Act
of 1997 is the requirement that encryption software be labelled as to
whether it uses Key Recovery Agents. While most cypherpunk-friendly
software will be proud to label itself as non-GAKked, it seems to me to
be fairly ominous, and is an important step towards banning non-GAK
crypto altogether.
   I think it would be cool to combine the labelling requirement with a
public relations campaign, not unlike the blue ribbon of last year.
   My proposal for the "no GAK" logo: a yellow star. To me, the
symbolism is pointed and poignant, but on the other hand it may come
dangerously close to invoking Godwin's law. If anyone else has any ideas
for a logo that would get the point across equally well but be a little
less controversial, I'd like to hear them.
P.S. My work on distributed key publication for the Internet is
progressing very well. I'll give an update at the next bay area meeting,
and there will be some UC Berkeley tech reports soon too. If my ideas
fly, they will make Key Recovery Agents moot for a lot of people.

@_subject: [NEW] mixer@htp.org (was: List of reliable remailers) 
Hi. I am aware of this remailer and am very happy to see one started in Japan. However, I am having a little problem adding it to the list because the Type-1 side of the remailer uses PGP 5.0, causing some compatibility problems with the remailer list software, which is based on PGP 2.6.2. Hopefully I can resolve these problems soon and add the remailer.
Thanks for your interest!

@_subject: Repost in text: IDEA(tm) weakness 
A quick review reveals that this is clearly another "PGP is broken"
hoax. The author is assuming that IDEA's * operation has a nonuniform
distribution of outputs given a uniform distribution of inputs. Since it
is taken mod 65537 (a prime), this is simply not the case - for constant
x, x * y mod 65537 is a permutation over y. Everything else flows from
this flawed assumption.
The rest of the post is silly as well. "Not tested on real PGP data
because I couldn't find where the IDEA data starts." Very funny, this
info is quite accessible. Also, posting the technique but witholding the
code is ridiculous. If the technique worked, it would get implemented
within hours.
Oh well. It was exciting for a minute or two.
