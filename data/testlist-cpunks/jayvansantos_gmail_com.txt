The topic has derailed from accoubtability and transperancy to American
politics with just you two guys talking. Borderline r/Conspiracy.
(Note:  I meant to type "$700,000" in Nigeria, below, not "$700.)
Oh, non-perceptive one, I seek to enlighten you.  While the payment for
bribery normally is thought of as occurring _before_ (or during) the
payback desired, as a practical matter it isn't very practical to bribe an
American president while he is in office.  But since the office of
President will continue to exist, and the people who are inclined to get
favors will continue to exist, and they all know this (see 'game theory'),
a logical solution is to delay the bribe payment until the office-holder is
out of office.  Obviously, while a president may wonder what would motivate
a briber to actually pay the bribe after he leaves office, the reality is
(remember reality?) is that word of welshing will surely get back to the
subsequent office-holder(s), poisoning the well for the
almost-but-not-quite-briber in the future.  No doubt, for example,
America's First Muslim President will pick up tens or even hundreds of
millions of dollars doing the rubber-chicken circuit in the (Muslim)
Middle-east.  Do you wonder why Obama hasn't 'jawboned' the Arab oil
producers to drop oil prices to, say, $60 per barrel?  Do you wonder why he
hasn't made more threats to open up the spigots of the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve?  Or why he hasn't approved the construction of the Keystone oil
pipeline?  That's right:  Obama is carrying-water for the very people he
expects to be bribed by about 3.5 years hence.

Look what has happened to Bill Clinton after leaving office.  It's said
he's worth $100 million  (In USD, presumably).  Mostly this comes in the
form of 'speaking fees':  As much as $700 in Nigeria. This is
not-so-thinly-disguised bribery. One solution that would slow him down
would be a 95% tax rate on an ex-president's income, at least that above
$400,000 per year.

No man. This isn't r/Bitcoin -_-. Your argument has already been
invalidated thousands of times. I was enjoying the conversation before it
got hostile :/.

Is there an open algorithm that keeps a summarization of what normally gets
posted here? Pointing out the topics, references, commonly used terms?

References: Either way. Companies like cryptoseal and lavabit are closing so that the
users can't participate in a class action suit against them. Decreasing the
chances of justice by making the next available court room a more
controlled one.
rant: [
This effects the possibiloty of a night watchman state (where private
companies compete for the remaining government services that should be
replaced and become efficient).
They want to bring the ideology of slow public / government controlled
entities / oligopolies controlled by people in the BR. Once the Business
Roundatable's philosophy on businesses affecting public policy came true
and once they started affecting policies themselves: they've decided ->
corporate interest is to use all of our information  for advertisements and
so from what it seems no decent crypto or true private companies shall make
an unregulated alliance better than stopwatchingus to stop the death of a
private corporation.
However, this somehow gets us closer to a social market economy. So that
might be a plus for those that agree but what is a capitalistic society
who's class structure will resemble a fascist one do with any form of
socialism for anybody who isn't in their class? Throw some conformity in
the short run and in the long: starve them with no options except possible
infinite detention or death. These are threats to all companies that are
trying to bypass US intelligence or do anything anonymous. There will be a
monopoly on predictions by inferring trade secrets from the direct access
of these servers / keys / user data. It becomes harder to confiscate
decentralized structures and data centers if they're out in the sea. Except
it may be easier to just send submarines missiles or drones but expecting
that might be a little to schizophrenic. ]
Does anyone know of a project that connects real dedicated pirate ships?
That perhaps get docked here and there but ultimately stay across sea in a
seasteeding like environment?
That might be the cheapest legal way besides satellites, space stations and
low orbit devices. Sea regulation, I believe, is easier to comply with than
air regulation. Yes we are living in interesting times when more and more
people want to be pirates in order to remain free!
