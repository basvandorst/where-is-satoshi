How about two signatures, verbatim and space-collapsed.
That way if the latter was valid but the former was not, you would
know that spacing was altered but other info remained valid.

Hey, no problem!
Just use the same escape call as the uucp pathalias.
When integrating an Internet/DNS aware gateway with 1200 Unix workstations
using /etc/hosts (no domain) and an X.400 connection to a VMS X.400 backbone,
I hooked in a little C program that converted all the addressing to proper
formats while also looking up userid's <-> fullnames in a B+tree database.
I even did fuzzy matching on names on a best-unique or exact basis.
Blew away X.500 functionality, which Dec and HP didn't even have integrated
with X.400 at the time.
Just need a program that takes an address on the command line and returns
it possibly modified with a yey or ney return code.

My impression was that most of the new systems dealt with variable bandwidth automatically.  28.8kbps might only be acheived on a higher
quality line.  The stated rates are max, not nominal.
They told me they use their own design 'datapump', and I know they use
a 68K (I swapped the rom in mine).
Also, from a previous note, you wouldn't want to turn off V.42/V.42bis
since that is where the error correction is.  Also, even on compressed
data, you get some additional bandwidth because it does packetized synchronous data.  This gets close to 8bits/byte instead of 10 (start,
I get around 1760cps for LZW (zoo/compress) data.
This is Zyxel to non-zyxel (Cerfnet or World).

Does everyone know that the new Zyxel's have CELP builtin?
Don't know details yet...

Beware: I couldn't think of any alternatives after this lex-meme flooded
my mind....  It's fairly contrived, but not as bad as the coff / robotussin
pair from GNU bintools...
I'm interested in discussing, reviewing, and writing parts of the proposed
new netnews system extensions/rewrites.
I've been modifying the current system anyway, so why not?
(I have already added compressed/archived news storage to INN and Tin for
my Local Internet Gateway (LIG) project/company/turn-key system.)
Now, about a name: the first thing that popped into my mind is:
PANTO (need I point this out? [MIME]  Hey, one good name deserves another...)
What's it stand for? hmmm..
Protected, Anonymous News Transaction Operation    or Operator
Protected  Ambiguity Net  Transaction Option
Protected, Authenticated News Trans.  Option
A PantoMime system is therefore one that supports News, Mail, with
Mime, PGP/PEM/whatever, etc. capabilities.
I always view News, Mail, and IRC as three legs of a triad of speed/bandwidth/audience tradeoffs so I'd like to have a cute extension to
cover realtime interactive also.
