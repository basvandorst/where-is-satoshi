You're far from the only one who has aroused his ire,
Bob...In fact, it occurs to me that he may deliberately
write in the way he does (superficially fascist, with
a few bows to libertarians where needed as long as the
fascists get final trust/control and are trusted to let
the powerless watch them) in order to have an excuse to
whine and fulminate...
