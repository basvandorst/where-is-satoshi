@_subject: Scientology tries to break PGP - and fails? 
There was a hack to pgp ui published a while back that would allow
someone decrypting a RSA encrypted file to print out the idea key.
Another feature of the hack allowed someone with the idea key to decrypt
an RSA PGP encrypted file ignoring the RSA headers and using the IDEA
key directly.
Using this software should allow the reciever of an RSA PGP encrypted
file to allow someone else to decrypt it (by giving them the IDEA key)
without exposing the secret key. The IV block check will  allow them to
check that they are using the correct idea key.

@_subject: Mark Mage is a Thief 
Dear Troubled,
  The guy's a fucking thief, from what I've heard.
  It seems the FBI is looking for him for a nasty number he
pulled on some retired people, ripping off their life savings.
He seems to have the IRS after him, as well.
  I'd steer clear of him.  He's bad news.

@_subject: ITAR / S 1726 / Civil Disobedience 
Dear Mr. President,
   I am writing to express my disapproval of the Clinton Administration's
position on the ITAR restrictions for encryption software.  This is an
important issue to me.
  1) Software is writing, so it is protected by the first amendment,      so the ITAR is unconstitutional.  The idea that only paper books
     are first amendment protected, and electronic books are not, is just      plain wrong.
  2) The ITAR does not help National Security, but in fact greatly reduces      our nations security because the Internet, and the computers and      information connected to it, are kept from using good Encryption.    3) I feel that encryption is very important for doing commerce on the      Internet, and that commerce on the Internet is important for our      economy (Internet is the fastest growing sizable segment).  You say      you like the "Information Super Highway" and you are "going to focus      on the economy like a laser".  You should be removing the ITAR      restrictions on American businesses.  Otherwise the business for      commerce software will go to companies in other countries.
  4) The Clinton Clipper III proposal to have government key escrow      is not acceptable.  Also, it will never work, since people will      always be able to buy and use software from the rest of the world.       This proposal is just slowing down Internet progress.  Please
     cancel Clipper III.
  4) I really don't want to vote for a president who would continue this
     type of regulation of the Internet.  The Republican candidate
     Bob Dole and the Libertarian candidate Harry Browne support      Senator Burns Pro-CODE bill S 1726 that would end this foolishness.       The current law, (see      says that "The President shall periodically review the items on      the United States Munitions List to determine what items, if any,      no longer warrant export controls under this section.  The results      of such reviews shall be reported to the Speaker of the House [...]      at least 30 days before any item is removed from the Munitions      List [...]."       It seems either of your two rivals would, if president, end the
     control of software.  Will we have to elect one of them president      to remove software from the Munitions list?
  5) As an act of civil disobedience I have personally exported an      encryption program (it is 3 lines of writing) using the web page at      Yours sincerely,
     Cypherpunks

@_subject: take The Boulder Pledge now!!! 
Eventually, all spam, and spamscam, would stop if everyone followed the advice of film critic Roger Ebert.  He wrote in *Yahoo*:
Last spring I was on a panel about "Bad Manners on the Net" at the Conference on World Affairs at the University of Colorado.  We agreeed that junk e-mail (then no more than a mote in the eye) could eventually bring the whole cooperative endeavor of online mail crashing to its ruin.  On the spot, I devised the Boulder Pledge, and we solemnly crossed our hearts and took it.                              The Boulder Pledge
                Under no circumstances will I ever purchase                 *anything* offered to me as the result of an
                unsolicited e-mail message.  Nor will I                 forward chain letters, petitions, mass mailings,
                or virus warnings to large numbers of others.
                This is my contribution to the survival of                 the online community.
The Boulder Pledge works by making junk mail unprofitable.  If nobody *ever buys anything,* spammers eventually will quit.  I hope.
End the Plague.  Raise your right hand.  Read aloud [the Boulder Pledge].  Then, pass it on, via Email to 10 or 20 of your concerned
friends.  Thanks.

Why are these dinosaurs fucking away perfectly good taxpayer's money
trying to shore up the walls of a crumbling civilization?
NEWS FLASH!!!   THE GENIE *WON'T* GO BACK IN THE BOTTLE                 ---------------------------------------
  Before the ink had dried on Judge Patel's ruling, 2,000,000 emails of
Professor Bernstein's work were on their way overseas, to every port of
call. (Courtesy of Email Blaster, that wonderful progam that tells us,
fifty times a day, how to "MAKE MONEY FA$T!!!")
  Hell, Professor Bernstein can _import_ it now!
  By September 8, the program will be obsolete, having been tweaked
a few generations by Iraquian programmers. I respectfully requested that
the Iraquis make any future versions of the program available to
youth who have to flee to Hitler's homeland with their website in order
to avoid being persecuted for their sexual predeliction.
 {See -  }
  No it doesn't. Haven't you heard of strong crypto?
  Thank you for pointing out that Phil Zimmerman wishes to protect me,
and Judge Patel wishes, on behalf of the government, to "eliminate the
protections" which strong encryptions affords me.
  The governement can't even protect themself, let alone the citizens,
as evidenced by the fact that the current sport of teenage hackers
across the nation is to send strong encryption overseas by way of the
government's email systems. (Can you say FBI? Sure you can! Can you say IRS? Sure you can!) Yet these dweebs want to destroy an industry that *is* capable of providing the citizens protection? (Considering the INSLAW affair, perhaps it would be more fitting to say "destroy _another_ industry.")
  I hope these idiots are having fun and making lots of money playing
their dinosaur games, because they are certainly accomplishing the
opposite of what they claim to be trying to do.
  The most that the dinosaurs in D.C. can manage to do, is to drag all
of the American business interests down into the ashes of history with
them as they attempt to build an Electromagnetic Curtain behind which
to imprison their citizens.
  Well, the CypherPunks were digging tunnels before the government even
knew they were predestined to build the Wall, so the fascist censors are sucking hind-tit and will, in all likelihood, continue to do so.

@_subject: Welcome to Cypherpunks! / Re: hi 
Welcome to the
                  Cypherpunks Mailing List (TcM)
                  ------------------------
  Your initial post to the list has been digitally classified by the Cypherpunks Automated Response system in order to determine the initial
level of reputation capital you will be awarded as a new member of the
Cypherpunks Mailing List (TcM).
Your initial entry level on the Cypherpunks Mailing List (TcM) will be:
               *** Level 2 ***
                    MORON
               *** Level 2 ***
  Level 2 is the lowest entry level available. From Level 2, you may
move up to other levels, at which the pinnacle is Cypherpunk Elite, or
down to Level 1, which each member of the Cypherpunks Mailing List (TcM)
has his or her own pet name for.
  Your reputation capital is increased or decreased according to the
quality and frequency of your posts. (Please note that, as is the case
with one's private parts, bigger is not necessarily better.)
         _______________________
         Warning & Disclaimer!!!
         -----------------------
The "Cypherpunks Mailing List (TcM) Level Classification System" (TM)
is based on the "Snow Anarchistic Rating System"...the "Paul Bradley
MiniAnarchist Rating System"...ad infinitum...since it is a random,
daily changing composite of the rating systems of each individual
Thus, once again, the higher levels are not necessarily better and you
may be subject to support and praise, or attack and condemnation, no
matter what the content or quality of your posts. The source of your
support on the list, or the attacks against you, may change from time
to time depending on which list member is having a "Bad Algorithm Day."
Also be advised that due to the highly technical nature of some of the
mathematical concepts addressed on the list, it is possible to move
beyond Level 0 (Flame Ony/No Content) and into negative levels of
reputation capital such as Level -1 (where your Doppleganger sends
10 copies of your own posts back to you).
At Reputation Capital levels below -1, you may be subjected to shame,
humiliation and filtering to the point where the only hope for your
posts being read is for you to post to the list anonymously, as a
"Monger" of one sort or another.
In conclusion, "Welcome to the list, _MORON_!"

@_subject: HOTTEST MONEY MAKING OPPORTUNITY ON THE INTERNET!! 
BEFORE YOU HASTILY DELETE THIS MAILING, PLEASE PRINT IT OUT. (NEED TO REPLY IF YOU WANT TO BE REMOVED FROM MY MAILING LIST, FAILURE TO RESPOND WILL AUTOMATICALLY REMOVE YOU FROM THE THIS IS THE HOTTEST OPPORTUNITY ON THE INTERNET AND ONE THAT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE (STYLE) FOREVER!
IF YOU THINK "NOT FOR ME", THEN WHAT ABOUT FOR YOUR FAMILY!
How Many Things Did You And Your Family Go Without This Past Year,
Simply Because You Couldn't Afford Them? Isn't it about time you and
your family got the things you always wanted? Aren't you tired of always
having to tell your family: "Maybe next year we can get that new car, we
just can't afford to take that kind of vacation," "I'm sorry, all I can afford
for you, is junior college," or "look, my boss said he'd try to give me that
raise in 6 months"
THIS PROGRAM IS PROVEN OVER AND OVER, TIME AND TIME AGAIN!
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF THOSE WHO HAVE SEEN IT WORK AND CONTINUE TO USE IT BECAUSE IT DOES WORK!!!
My name is Matthew Forti; I'm a 45-year-old father, and husband. As a rule, I delete all unsolicited "junk" e-mail and use my account primarily for business.  I received what I assumed was this same e-mail countless times and deleted it each time.
About two months ago I received it again and, because of the catchy subject line,  I finally read it.  Afterwards, I thought , "OK, I give in, I'm going to try this.  I can certainly afford to invest $20 and, on the other hand, there's nothing wrong with creating a little excess cash."  I promptly mailed four $5 bills and, after receiving the reports, paid a friend of mine a small fee to send out some e-mail advertisements for me.  After reading the reports, I also learned how easy it is to bulk e-mail for free! I was not prepared for the results.  Everyday for the last six weeks, my  P.O. box has been overflowing with $5 bills; many days the excess fills up an extra mail bin and I've had to upgrade to the corporate-size box!  I am stunned by all the cash  that keeps rolling in!
I promise you, if you follow the directions in this e-mail and be prepared to eventually set aside about an hour each day to follow up (and count your money!), you will make at least as much money as we did.  You don't need to be a wiz at the computer, but I'll bet you already are.   If you can open an envelope, remove the money, and send an e-mail message, then you're on your way to the bank.  Take the time to read this so you'll understand how easy it is. Believe me, it works!
                                                       GO FOR IT NOW!
Matthew Forti
The following is a copy of the e-mail I read:
This is a LEGAL, LOW-COST, MONEY-MAKING PHENOMENON.
PRINT this letter, read the directions, THEN GET STARTED TODAY!
You are about to embark on the most profitable and unique program you may ever see.  Many times over, it has demonstrated and proven its ability to generate large amounts of cash.  This program is showing fantastic appeal with a huge and ever-
growing on-line population desirous of additional income.
This is a legitimate, LEGAL, money-making opportunity.  It does not require you to come in contact with people, do any hard work, and best of all, you never have to leave the house, except to get the mail and go to the bank!
This truly is that lucky break you've been waiting for!  Simply follow the easy instructions in this letter, and your financial dreams will come true! When followed correctly, this electronic, multi-level marketing program works perfectly... 100% OF THE TIME!
Thousands of people have used this program to:
    -  Raise capital to start their own business
    -  Pay off debts
    -  Buy homes, cars, etc.,
    -  Even retire!
This is your chance, so read on and get started today!
