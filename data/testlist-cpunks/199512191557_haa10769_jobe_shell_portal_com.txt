Not anything??  That's shameful ... where on earth are the values in America, today?  AT&T and Netscape have jointly made a small fortune distributing this
product, and yet NEITHER company feels that the software engineers who
"voluntarily" made a difference -- a couple of students -- deserve
even a wooden nickel for the ideas which were used.
It's absolutely shameful.  But then, I guess that AT&T and Netscape
have no shame at all.
They just steal "intellectual property" from students, and don't even
pay a token amount.
And people wonder what's wrong with Aemrica?
