you invoke it to defend your point of view.
I'm tired of absolutists who cannot see that there's no such thing as

spread unhampered?  Violence is bad? Vote for dissolution of police, if you _really_ mean
that. But don't take the "my hands is clean" high moral ground.  It is
_your_ guilt, too, for being lazy to learn what is going on, and failing
to elect a goverment with a clue, not the bumbling idiot with a Texan
accent and vocabulary of a fifteen-years-old.

Here's how America looks from outside.  A bunch of incompetents and

asked for it" postures you know where.  Because i know that Americans are
not really hypocritic, just terribly ignorant.
