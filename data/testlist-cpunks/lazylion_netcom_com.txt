So Eric, how's bout we all send messages to cypherpunk-cake at toad.com
with a valid reply-to and it sends back a response such as "Please
confirm that this is a valid signiture by ... (doing something random?)
BTW, do you remember who it was that was talking about pgp mail headers who
has not yet responded to my groovy idea of using rfc822's "Encrypted:"
field?  So far, the only responses I've seen are from others saying "Yea,
when ya find out, let me know too..."  Any thoughts?

Hmm.  Very interesting.  I observe two not completely diametrically opposed
viewpoints here.  Consider:
On one hand, there has been a lot of (IMHO government generated) hype
lately about the very real possibility of justice department "legal"
reprisals against individuals running what I consider to be common carrier
messaging services (BBS's, remailers, hosts, etc.) based on the content of
messages passing through those services (porn GIF's, etc).
While it is clear to me that in this environment of obvious government
oppression of expression through terror tactics against common carriers, it
is certainly true that a responsible indvidual in this environment must do
what they think is appropriate to protect themselves from government
harassment.  We are not all in situations where we can be arrested and
thrown in jail (even for an appropriate cause) and simply ignore
responsibilities to loved ones and employees (or even customers) who may be
relying on us to provide for them.
Each of us must make an individual choice weather and how much to fight the
oppressive atmosphere by refusing to subscribe to the justice department's
hillarious misreading of the Bill of Rights.
It behooves us all to respect the positions of those who for whatever
reason do not wish to put themselves in further danger by taking the firm
stand that we all know is appropriate against these government hoodlums.
I support and respect the right of any concered operator of a BBS, host or
anonomous remailer to responsibly (and concentually!) refraim from entering
this battle.  While it is true that I believe that it does further slightly
damage our cause, it is a necessary evil to support the wishes of others.
It is, of course, necessary, to completely disclose policies like this to
all perspective users (within reason) and it would be most convinient for
those users if an actual policy were developped and published, but I can
see that since we are in a state of controversy about this very issue, any
attempt to define what is or is not appropriate will always be met with
great discontent (probably on both sides :))
Live & Let Live (but INFORM!)
"Just Say KNno!"

@_subject: rfc822 headers include encrypt std 
I've only been on the list a few days now, and the net for only a few
weeks.  Plesae pardon the apology :) but could someone please explain
to me why we are not putting an "Encryption: PGP " line
in the header of each of our messages as allowed by RFC 822 (which I
was just reading for the first time today)
---Begin quote of RFC822 on Internet Message Header formats:---
     4.7.3.  ENCRYPTED
             Sometimes,  data  encryption  is  used  to  increase  the
        privacy  of  message  contents.   If the body of a message has
        been encrypted, to keep its contents private, the  "Encrypted"
        field  can be used to note the fact and to indicate the nature
        of the encryption.  The first  parameter  indicates  the
        software  used  to  encrypt the body, and the second, optional
         is intended to  aid  the  recipient  in  selecting  the
        proper  decryption  key.   This  code word may be viewed as an
        index to a table of keys held by the recipient.
---End quote of RFC822 on Internet Message Header formats---
This would certainly solve many obvious problems.  Of course, you all
have seen this stuff for years and are not doing it so there must be
some really interesting reason... ?
Feel free to respond to me by email instead of posting to the group
and if anyone else wants to know, I'll forward responses to them.  If
I've struck a chord, by all means let's discuss this as well as t-shirts.
BTW, I'm looking forward to subscribing to alt.cypherpunks.merchandising :)

@_subject: distributed autonomous networks 
I've thought about this a lot.  Right now, there's an international (very
low speed) sort-of internet based in Amateur Packet Radio.  Everyone has a
2meter FM (range 5-10 miles over flat turrain; up to 300 to a tall mountain
through a repeater) handi-talky on their belts and a 1200 (a little 2400)
*half duplex* modem with which they check into whatever bbs is near by and
get their mail from all over the world.  There are 19.2 & I think 56kpbs
backbones operating over satelittes & High Frequency.  It works.  It's
intolerably slow.  It's operating legally on ham frequencies which do not
(legally) allow encryption.
The main reason it's so slow is that the protocal was designed by these
guys in Phoenix 10 years ago to use the radios popularly off the shelf
Now, however, there are *FULL DUPLEX* radios available cheap ($400) off the
shelf that use separate bands for tx & rx to make them cheap.  (Most of
these are 144 MHz <-> 440 MHz, Transmit on one, receive on the other,
either way)
I'm working on a new protocal which instead of using the current CSMA/CD,
has local repeaters serving an area which do full duplex & pass a token
around.  Unfortunately, I'll probably only be able to increase bandwidth
enough to bring the current 4-5 users per frequency up to 15 or 20.  This
is still nowhere near enough to do what you want, but it does still use
off-the-shelf radios & modems you can build for $20 in parts & connect to
your PC or Mac (Software will also be req'd- mods to current stuff will
My roomate, tvr at cnmat.CNMAT.Berkeley.EDU (KD6PAG), is working on custome
radios that raise that 2400 bps barrier to 19.2 or 38kpbs.  I think that
without my full duplex protocal, he'll still have to wait around dealing
with transmit-receive turnover latency, but hey- if it works, wow!
Anyone else with any cool ideas?
