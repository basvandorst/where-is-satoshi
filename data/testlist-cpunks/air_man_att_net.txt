How long do you think NRA management's "Winning" Team could continue suckering gun rights supporters into sending them $200 MILLION a year if they came out and frontally assaulted the right to keep and bear arms, rather than gradually undermining it while appearing to fight the good fight?
I wish you were right. I wish it was just incompetence.

Hmm. Let me get this straight. Project Gulag is the best thing for RKBA since, what was it, I don't know, the Nazi Gun Control Act of 1938?
ENFORCE ALL EXISTING GUN LAWS WITH ZERO TOLERANCE.
That's the core Project Gulag mantra, and it didn't take a rocket scientist to predict that the overt enemy, HCI et al., would accept it with open arms, make it their own program, and run with it. Why do you think NRA now holds press conferences with HCI to support it? Do you really think the anti-gunners are that stupid?
Sometimes the "Winning" Team adds a mumble or two about aiming Project Gulag against "criminals." Well what the hell do you think most of us already are who refuse to comply with those existing gun laws we tried to stop from being enacted in the first place?
And don't tell me NRA management's "Winning" Team gives a rat's ass about putting potential felons like me and most other gun rights activists in prison. That's why their infomercial says "then he did what any decent, law-
abiding citizen would do, and turned in his guns."
That quote reveals the mindset of NRA's "Winning" Team management. It's a pro-police-state, authority worshipping team. If Feinstein passes a law, they expect you to obey it. And if you don't, they'll help send you up the river right along with the murderers, convenience store robbers, serial rapists, and child molesters. All you have to do is get caught ignoring an existing gun law, or a new one.
I wish it was just incompetence, but it's not. And I wish I didn't know about it. Life was happier when I could believe NRA was run by more or less well-
intentioned, if not totally competent people. But it isn't, and having served on the board, I bear the burden of first hand knowledge. It's not pleasant to have to tell grown men there's no gun rights tooth fairy.
Too many folks are compelled by nature to believe that everything NRA does is by definition right, and if it doesn't appear to be right, than somehow it must be part of a diabolically good plan hatched by masterminds that'll work out for us in the end. I was once one of those folks, and I'm here to urge you to get over it. Do the movement a favor; cut the tribalistic worship routine and stop treating NRA like a sacred cow, immutable in nature. It's not. It's run by real people, increasingly those who are helping destroy our heritage of freedom. There's a Wizard of Oz behind the drapes, and he's not on our side.
Yes, most of us need something to believe in. But the NRA is important only because of the good or harm it can do to our heritage. Loyalty to the Constitution is vastly more important than blind loyalty to the NRA. And being loyal to the rightful mission of the NRA, which I am, has long been dangerously inconsistent with blind loyalty to NRA management, especially the current "Winning" Team Junta.
