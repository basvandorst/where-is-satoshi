Having had "*coin tipjar" explained to me, I have set up a BTC receive address.    "jim btc tipjar"      1AzNPQ1NhiD9uG1hU5g5Kdaccb88Dus2Bo
    Please note:  This address is the BTC tipjar for "Jim Bell", "James Dalton Bell", living at 7214 Corregidor, Vancouver WA 98664.  (phone and cell on request; As far as I know I'm listed.  I've never had an unlisted/unpublished phone number.).   Ham Call N7IJS (apparently I am the LAST "Tech-Plus" in existence; the FCC has refused to re-up my 2010 license application, but the laws say I can still do ham.)
    Note Also:  Having been on (and off) the Cypherpunks list since 1995 (mostly off, of course), I understand that a reasonable sense of caution will make many of you think, "Is this REALLY the 'Jim Bell' who wrote the AP essay, etc?"   For those who doubt, I have Skype set up to do a voice videophone.  There is a picture of me, in a green sweater, taken by Declan McCullagh about June 2000 on the web; I haven't changed a lot.  (I even have my green sweater, too!).

I believe all currencies and crosses are constantly being speculated day-in and day-out.  So  I wouldn't be surprised or worry too much about Bitcoin being speculated.  As long as the market has liquidity and healthy supply/demand it shouldn't be of a problem.  
About our point about bitcoin not having any inherent value, isn't energy exerted to mine those coins costs involved?  Hence if people begin to mine more for bitcoins then the cost of energy will go up as difficulty of mining goes up as well.  This is the same concept to your cloud storage example.  
I disagree the mining part has nothing to do with bitcoin prices.  Its like saying supply and demand does not affect a price of a goods being sold.  In your example of falling price on Bitcoin (or any other currency) would probably be contributed to liquidity issue.  If no one wants something or all the buyers are not making the bid doesn't matter what kind of scheme you use the price will fall and will fall hard.  This goes for everything in this world. Tulip, Gold, Silver, Copper, etc.  But when the price fall doesn't mean the product itself lacks value.  Last I remembered I still had to pay for that basket of tulips I sent for mothers day.

As I was telling Jayvan, the idea would be that early adopters use the currency for its inherent uses to them, as opposed to its speculative potential.
Right now, bitcoin is almost exclusively speculative. It's worth a lot of money because the value has been increasing consistently. That's tulipmania.
In a perfect world you would have some way to protect a currency against speculation. The volatility in bitcoin makes it less useful as a currency, therefore the speculation is damaging bitcoin.
I don't have a solution, and I'm not suggesting one, I'm merely suggesting that a solution might exist that would be a substantial improvement.
If bitcoin was based on something that had inherent value, say cloud storage, then a spike in value would be followed by a spike in the amount of storage being contributed to the network (bitcoin currently does this, a spike in price is followed by a spike in mining). The key here though is that the network would be protect from dramatic dips in value. When bitcoin drops in price, all of the abundant mining does nothing to save bitcoin, because the bitcoin mining doesn't actually add any value to the network. Nobody cares how many petaflops the network is pulling, because the petaflops can't be put to use somewhere else.
But if the mining was based on cloud storage, a dramatic drop in the price of the currency would result in a dramatic drop in the cost of storing data on the network. That's something that actually has use, and so people would let the price fall unreasonably low (instead they would find a way to make use of the cheap storage). This would allow the currency to ride arbitrary spikes in price while being protected against arbitrary drops in price.
Jim, the amount of mining being done on the bitcoin network has no impact on the price. The price might have an impact on the volume of mining, but because the mining is specific to the bitcoin network (double sha2 hashing or something like that) it can't be sold or used for other applications. Bitcoin mining is only good for bitcoin mining, which means the demand for the mining is exclusively based on value of the bitcoins being mined every day.

I think its important that new alt coins being introduced.  Not that it confuses the market.  But to keep innovation going.  Creating specialized coins with different characteristics would only help the entire market move forward.  Its like the car industry in its infancy.  How many car companies were out there at the time when people were trading in their horse carriages with 4 wheels + a motor?

I suggest reading  instead of reinventing the wheel here. All of this has been discussed, ad nauseum, there and a few other forums.
We don’t live in a perfect world and people will always attempt to game the system to make themselves rich. The problem other alt currencies have is why would anyone adopt them when bitcoin is already there and clearly (somewhat) successful? Why mine litecoin, for example, when if I mine bitcoin (or even buy them), I make money for sure (for now at least)?

Hi David,
I am not sure of your assumption on the cloud storage.  What about the component cost goes into it?  memory costs?  I remember when I was a teen trading DRAMS the price isn't that stable for certain period of time.  So even if demand for cloud storage fall, wouldn't cost of the cloud storage could be rising due to other events?
About perishable commodity.  I don't know where you live.  But I know cost of milk has gone up tremendously in certain parts of the world.  In China, cost of salt has gone up 10 folds in a short few years.  Price of corn and orange juice can always limit up or down if some crazy weather hit certain part of the country.
 From: David Vorick Sent: Tuesday, November 26, 2013 10:52 AM
Joe, the only reason that the price of cloud storage would fall is if demand for cloud storage falls. The value of cloud storage over time should be fairly stable, perhaps not as stable as today's US dollar but certainly more stable than bitcoin is today.
But in the case of tulips, bitcoins, etc., their stability was only derived from their speculative value. Bread will be reasonable stable, because people don't speculate in bread. Bread has a minimum price, because there is a limited supply and a clearly defined need. All commodities are not equal. Bitcoin is one of the worst I can imagine, but the tulips during tulipmania take the cake.
I believe you can regulate cloud storage in a way that prevents fraudsters from manipulating it. The only assumption I need is that the majority of the network is honest. You can use hashing + random strings to confirm that a person still has the file they are hosting. You only need then to be sure that the person hosting the file and the person uploading the file are not in cahoots. You can achieve that by making a random mapping between people and hosts, and only picking the host after a person has announced how much file storage they wish to rent (and paid for the first month). This makes it too expensive to host files on your own machines, because you have a very low probability of getting the opportunity to store a file on your own machine.

Yeah stay away from Twitter Jim. Its bunch of junks and rants (including mine) follow up with more rants uh, tweets.
By the way I check out your fiber invention link below.  The address on file is still back at the prison, you probably want to change that just as an fyi.

Twitter for me?  My impression is that this is more for issues where seconds, minutes, or hours count.  I don't know who I'd want to follow so closely as to monitor Twitter.
As for me saying something?  Well, I don't know if I have that much to say.  It's not like I don't have opinions...I have many of them.  But, right now the world is awash in opinions, from blogs to twitter.  What would I talk about...uh...other than the obvious?   What, in general, would people want ME to talk about?
Further, right now my main interest is in promoting and developing my isotope-modified fiber optic invention.                    Jim Bell
