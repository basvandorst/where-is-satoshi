My mother (an English major) raised me to be very careful about language.
The gov't's use of the word "escrow" for key registration is as offensive to
me now as it was in April of 93 -- perhaps more so, through repetition.
I've decided to use the term
as my name for the real issue here -- and let "escrow" stand for the act
of doing something for me (cf., the dictionary definition).  (Besides, GAK
has onomatopoeic value. :-)

where that leads me.  If there were such attacks, they would rely on
information about the key leaking into the ciphertext, independent of the

The announcement calling for calls to Moakley includes the following
explanatory blurb:
This is inaccurate chauvanism and is hurting our cause.
The US (and especially the NSA) wanted to believe it was the leader in
cryptography.  The NSA wanted to believe, and probably still believes, that
the only cryptography worthy of the name is what they produce.  Everything
else is mere toys.  The only crypto the US produces is therefore theirs and
therefore all crypto leaving the US needs to be controlled.
To the contrary, Switzerland has long been a producer of very good,
commercial crypto.  The US military even bought crypto devices from
Switzerland during WW-II, if I remember Kahn correctly.  Over the years,
different countries have taken the lead (since it's usually tied to
individuals and to national export and mfg laws).
In the 4000 year history of cryptography, private citizens of various
countries have been making, using and distributing their own strong
cryptography, without concern for government controls.
The US and the NSA might want to believe they're all that important, but in
fact they're not and never have been (except possibly for a momentary
period starting in about 1950 -- a period during which the US was  in
*everything*, since the rest of the world had been bombed back to
subsistence level).
Crypto is not a US product and *never has been*, wishful thinking by the
NSA notwithstanding.  Strong crypto has always been dual source and dual
use, except during those periods when civilians had it and the gov't
didn't.  Strong crypto outside the government and outside the USA is far
from something new.  If we concede that point to the proponents of
export controls and of Clipper, we have lost a major battle.

As someone at TIS actively involved in looking at SKE and related
technology, I find it bothersome that Tim keeps mixing the terms SKE and
GAK.  I'm not a fan of giving government access to civilian keys, no matter
what form it takes.  However, my mother was an English major and she taught
me to be protective of the language.
that it's important to keep terms well defined and separate.  Try this:
KE:	key escrow, implementation and grantee unspecified
HKE:	key escrow, in hardware, grantee unspecified
SKE:	key escrow, in software, grantee unspecified
KEG:	key escrow, implementation unspecified, government grantee
GAK:	government access to keys, method unspecified
GAK is clearly more general than KE and even more general than SKE.  There
is a real danger that (KE/HKE/SKE) could be subverted by the government but
there are some real uses (as have been pointed out here) for what Steve
Walker (the TIS president) calls a "spare key in the wallet".  [I'm hoping
to get his paper on the subject on our FTP or Web server -- will tell
people when it's there.]  A spare key version of SKE would have the key's
owner as grantee -- leaving the gov't out of the loop *except through
normal subpoena and search warrant access*.
My predictions:
Meanwhile, NSA access isn't covered by any of these terms, except perhaps
GAK.  This is relevant since at the last KEA meeting (NIST's "Key Escrow
Approaches"), TIS SKE was demonstrated and people from industry were asked
if they wanted to participate in an experiment -- put it in some product,
let some gov't agency be the guinea pig user community and see if the FBI
was happy with the result (this would be SKEG -- SKE with gov't as grantee)

Exactly.  The term is tainted.
Meanwhile, the offense to the English language remains even if we give the

(the Data Security Letter) talking about this process:
That's true to the FBI's word choice.
So -- postulate a Key Escrow service with escrow agents chosen by Fidel
Castro and the Columbian drug cartel as grantee -- or, as an alternative,
postulate a PGP key provided by the FBI for good little boys and girls to
include as a recipient during encryption with PGP-voice.

@_subject: minor disagreement at the CSSPAB meeting this a.m. 
The CSSPAB is having an open meeting today and tomorrow at the Gaithersburg
Hilton.  I happened to be there to hear an interesting exchange.
(Those in the area might want to drop by tomorrow to sit in.  (Tomorrow's
agenda: Gov't email, reaction to public meeting on NII security; Congressional
privacy & security; tax systems; NIST activities; public comment (sign up
in advance with the secy)))
Lynn McNulty of NIST was giving a summary of the KEA (Key Escrow Alternatives)
meeting of Aug 17.  One of his summary lines was to the effect that industry
believed there was a "significant market for escrow products".
William Whitehurst of IBM, who had been at the KEA meeting, raised his hand to
disagree with that statement.  As he remembered it, industry believed there
was a significant market for encryption and that it was an international
market and that we (the US) were in danger of being left in the dust by
foreign competition -- but that there was no market at all for escrow
Steve Walker of TIS seconded Whitehurst's observation.
Lynn replied that they were saying the same thing because the government won't
allow export of encryption without key escrow therefore there's a big market
for escrow products.
Makes lots of sense, doesn't it???  :-|

@_subject: thoughts on RC4 
Alleged-RC4 (1) requires that the table be a permutation and (2) might base
security on the fact that the table is itself permuted beyond recognition
after a small number of inputs.
(1) You could conceivably go to an array of 65K short values and retain the
permutation but I wouldn't try to go to an array of longs.  I don't have
32GB of RAM on my workstation.
(2) With a longer array, the amount of input until the array is
indistinguishable from the one with which you started is proportionally
longer.  I don't know if that means that shorter arrays are more secure,
but it's worth taking a look at.

Assuming for the moment that alleged-RC4 came from the keyboard of Ron
Rivest, my question is whether to look at this as an amateur cipher from a
famous cryptologist -- or as a carefully designed cipher from a
professional.  If it's the latter, we should probably look for some
underlying strengths the way the community picked apart S-box design rules
years ago.

I think this is wishful thinking on our parts.  Crypto would have to be
built-in and automatic (not even a button push required to activate it)
before I think you'd see much of a user community.  Even then, some people
might encounter key exchange problems and beg for a button to *disable*
Until you see a substantial percentage of the population using crypto, I
don't think law enforcement will have any problem.  They'll worry about
drug dealers as a new potential threat, but have them read Kahn about Rum
Runners (in a chapter with that in the title).
So -- the argument is bogus.  Why advance it?
My answer: because the Agency advancing it (with cypherpunks as unwitting
accomplices) wants to create the perception of a threat of loss of power
in those who have power (Congress, President) so that they'll give state-of-emergency powers to the appropriate Agency to fight back.
Net result:  no real threat; real increase in power for one Agency.

This really bothers me.
If the government today has a functional ability to interpret in a timely
fashion information it has obtained, that is purely an accident (that the
communicating parties chose not to encrypt) and the pure accident is likely
to remain (because they will continue so to choose).
However, the government has been trying to establish an enforceable right
to succeed at gathering intelligence by surveillance and it has never been
granted that right and should never be.
Giving it a right to tap deals with gov't actions (permitting tapping).
Giving it a right to understand what it taps deals with citizen actions
(prohibiting encryption).
Citizens have always had a right to try to keep a secret from the gov't and
on this one point, we should not yield one micron.  There should be *no*
move at all toward establishing a right of the gov't to understand what it

@_subject: Anyone seen the 'quantum cryptanalysis' thread on sci.crypt? 
The real roadblock might be that there are limits to how many bits there
can be in a register.  NIST's recent Quantum Computation conference
included discussion of the expected lifetime of a computation (what
fraction of a second the computation would have to complete in before the
internal state space goes incoherent).  The more bits are bound together,
the shorter the lifetime of those bits, according to one result.  However,
the more bits you have the longer the computation has to be.  This suggests
that any given Quantum Computer technology point will lead to a maximum
state size (likely in a small number of bits) for a given application.
Trouble is, I'm not a quantum physicist, so my understanding of this is
superficial.  Any real physicists out there?

I see several reasons, but I don't see a reason for a CA in this case.  The
key being signed can serve in place of the CA's key.  That is, the key can
be self-signed.  All that needs to be proved in this case is that someone
owns the private key which goes with the public key.
As for what good that key is --
Prior to our meeting in person this year, all you knew about me was by my
postings.  If I had signed all of them with the same self-signed key, then
you would know that all of those postings came from one "person" (the set
of people, presumably only one person, with access to the private key).
The postings define the person, in your mind, and you are absolutely
certain that they came from that person (defined as I did above).  You
don't need any further certification to attest to that fact.
No economic impact, you say?

I would try injecting noise and seeing how well you can control the output
signal.  I would also do a Fourier transform of the output and look for
cyclic behavior -- then see how the frequency spectrum can be modified by
turning machinery on and off, turning radios on and off, ....
You can also try various compression algorithms to see how much entropy
they claim to see.
When that's done, you can then use some of my ranno conditioning code,
free on the net (although written for UNIX, for now):

AFAIK, Clipper and most of the other systems had escrow agents oblivious to
the identity of the subject of the warrant.  I have seen *no* system which
allows an escrow agent to know it's not being duped by the feds and I
believe I know how to prove that that's not possible.
If you see any such system, please let me know.
BTW, there was Silvio Micali's design which allowed the escrow agents to
verify that they were given the right private key shares without anyone
learning the private key in the process.  That's the only oblivious
mechanism I recall in this business.

On the more paranoid side of this, in spite of Steve Walker's relish over
the fact that TIS's CKE (Commercial Key Escrow -- his name for the DRC
work) keeps keys out of government hands, except in cases of actual search
warrant, it looks (according to one privacy-advocate lawyer I discussed
this with) as if access can be gained with a mere subpoena -- and,
according to Scott Charney (of Justice Dept., if I remember correctly) the
currnet view is that if you voluntarily give a copy of your key to your
employer, you've abandoned your presumption of privacy and that relieves
the gov't of getting a search warrant (and maybe even subpoenna).

The crypto section has no GAK exclusion.  It makes it as illegal to release
GAKed crypto on a net as PGP.
I believe that the concern about defining predicate acts this way comes
from the RICO requirement that there be TWO instances of a crime in order
to pass the test of perpetrating a *pattern of crime* and therefore be
ranked as a mobster subject to RICO.  My guess is that the intent is that
from one placement on an FTP server or one posting to a newsgroup, the
perpetrator of that heinous act will have passed his RICO qualification and
therefore be subject to having all he owns taken from him.
Meanwhile, the Federal civil forfeiture fund goes to good things.  The last
$9M (I believe it was) went to buying up AT&T DES phones to be made into
Clipper phones.  Of course, the conversion hasn't happened yet and the DES
phones are sitting in a warehouse someplace -- but the $9M fund went to
really good use, saving the world from AT&T DES.

@_subject: Sources of randomness 
My cable feed into my Mac, for example, has surprisingly little noise --
and it's only local noise (stuff only at my house, not available to the
eavesdropper) which counts as entropy.
Most Macs and PCs have audio inputs.  Most of those are mono,
unfortunately.  [The numeric difference between two stereo mics is
especially hard for an eavesdropper-wannabe to predict/compute, assuming
the room isn't silent.]  However, if the eavesdropper doesn't have a mic in
your room, there's still some entropy available on the mono channel.
Meanwhile, my old Sparcstation 1 had an A-D which, when no mic was
connected, gave about 1 bit/second of entropy.  (The newer Sparc here gives
solid 0's with no mic.)
Recorded audio is useless as entropy, of course.
Almost all computers have a mouse and a normal signature, hand-written with
a mouse, has great gobs of noise.  (I'm still working on the little PC
program to measure this -- but preliminary results show a minimum of 1 bit
of noise per mouse sample -- or 200 bits per signature.  Final results may
get higher entropy rates, but I'll wait for the real results before
claiming that.)

I'd be nervous about using a radio receiver which can be fed with a signal
by the adversary.  A noisy resistor or diode should be less subject to bias
by an active opponent.
Whatever you use for a source of bits, it should be carefully measured to
determine how much real entropy is in the source.  Don't assume all the
bits you get are independent, flat distribution bits.
You might need to hash bits down until you get independence.  You also
might want to provide some further ranno conditioning.

B.      Industry presentations on draft criteria
C.      Breakout sessions on criteria
          (a suggestion has been made to also have one on policy issues)
D.      Reports from breakout sessions
E.      Wrapup
Remember, also, that if you would like to make a presentation at the

Danger, Will Robinson!  (see below)
This part sounds good...a sort of master translation service.
Now I get worried.  This communication with the demon is via some IPC --
maybe even via a LAN.  Some things can't be distributed safely and
authentication is  on my list.
Crypto keys are  on my list of things you can't distribute (unless they
are wrapped, of course).
Public keys, if that's what you're talking about, have perfectly good
nonforgeable names -- themselves.  They are unique.  They are the proper
name which can collect all the attributes of that key which are of interest
(e.g., permission to spend $, name of a human who knows the private key,
attributes about that human, etc.).
I've seen this happen several times.  As a list gets popular, it
diversifies.  You might try sci.crypt.research -- since it's moderated.

security, is hold all the crypto secrets (therefore the crypto itself) in a
device (PCMCIA card?)  in the physical posession of the user.  The
cooperating-process model could make that easier -- but, if designed wrong,
it could call for the device to give up a secret to be sent by IPC over to
the slave process.
That sounds fine -- but why deal with a text MOSS representation?  It's the
modulus which is unique -- so just hash the binary bytes of the modulus,
MSB first.  There's no need to force anyone checking a key to have all the
MOSS printing software in the loop.  You might also consider using SHA
instead of MD5 -- but that adds to the character count on your business
card.  [I printed up my own business cards with PGP fingerprints for my 2
primary keys -- and it took up about 1/4 of the card, in a readable font.]
PGP keyring structures do use the key as its own name, I believe.  The
UserID is a separate entity, associated with the stand-alone key.  A
signature applies to a pair (UserID,Key).
If I could change the PGP keyring structure, I'd add a new entity -- an
Attribute block -- a string and my key ID, with a signature on the
Attribute+ObjectKey.  This can be done today with the UserID and signature

Yes, it could easily be done wrong in such a way that the user gets
confused rather than helped; burdened rather than relieved.
I advocate aliases because that's how *I* think.  I think in words so I
assign my own names (aliases) for the people who populate my mental model
of the world.  By definition, these are all my correspondents.  It's
possible of course that some other people (of different Myers-Briggs type,
perhaps) think differently -- not in words or aliases.  If that's true, we
should find out how they think and associate the right thing for them.  For
example, I had a friend (a painter/sculpter) who thought in images.  She
might prefer to use little pictures or icons (of her own drawing) as the
That's true.  What the user would have to see is some icon (or, for
text-bound folks, a temporary unique string) until the user chooses and
assigns the appropriate alias.  That icon would have no meaning by itself.
It would acquire a meaning by being associated with some message or set of
a) an attribute testimony (signed by someone with known authority to

I, the user, would want to be able to call up the set of defining messages
for any key or alias at any time in the future -- just in case I get so
many aliases that I forget who one belongs to.
I keep a fairly large database of aliases already, in my .mailrc on UNIX.
Eudora permits a similar DB.  So do a number of other mailers.  Users must
be demanding this feature and using it.  All I say we have to add to that
is protection from tampering.
I wouldn't be so quick to dismiss it.
Of course -- you have to have some means for communicating and recording
attributions (that the person who owns a key is allowed to spend money on a
given bank account; that the person who owns a key goes by the name Carl or
receives mail at cme at acm.org; that the person who owns a key is a trusted
developer of PGP; ...).
These two have to go together -- but I'm curious what anyone means by
"validating keys".  I see this as the flaw killing certificate structures
like X.509 or PGP's.  [Even Steve Kent, a major X.509 advocate, seems to
see this problem (with sadness, in his case).]
I had a secretary once, long ago.  I would drive her home from work
occasionally -- or to parties -- when her husband wasn't around or wasn't
interested in going someplace.  One time, in passing, he noted that this
arrangement was OK with him because he "trusted her".  I trusted her, too.
I knew her to be having affairs with various people (not me at the time)
but he didn't.  So we each trusted her but what we trusted her to be was
different.  Just saying that we trusted her wasn't saying anything.
As soon as you qualify the "validated key" (e.g., to be allowed to spend
money, etc.), you get to the signed attributes which I advocate over
certificates.  If all you do with the validated key is tie it to a text
string which purports to specify a human being, as X.509 or PGP do, you
haven't done anything for me.  If all humans had unique names, then this
might mean something to me (assuming I knew the human in question and knew
his unique name).  However, that's what killed X.509 -- the need for unique
names.  We don't have them and we're not about to adopt some new social
structure which assigns them.  Even if we did all adopt unique names, you
postulated a *large* set of people to communicate with -- larger than my
immediate circle of acquaintances, presumably -- so even a unique name
would be meaningless to me because I would not have met the person in
question.  If the unique name certificate works at all it's because I have
some mechanism (not mentioned in the certificate hierarchy design) for
attaching attributes to the named person.  However, if I haven't met the
person in question, I don't have that mechanism already and it needs to be
created alongside the certificate mechanism.
I don't need testimony about the name (unique or otherwise) of the person
who owns that key.  I need testimony about the attributes of that person
(PGP developer; fellow Cypherpunk; FBI agent; undercover NSA plant;
permission to use a checking account; receives mail at xxx at yyy.com; ...).
That testimony can be provided by referencing the key itself, rather than
some (artificially unique) name which exists only to link the attribute to
the key.  The S/W which links these together and lets me find the various
testimonies for a key has to be convenient -- but that was your original
point and I concur.  I object only to the implication that current
certificate hierarchy thinking gets us closer to that goal than the direct
signed attribute statements would.

Of course.  This isn't the base case.  We would have some keys which I sign
based on my own personal knowledge; things handed to me by people I know;
some possibly published in the paper where the real key owner would see the
claim and be able to contest it.  PGP today comes shipped with some keys to
provide the base for a chain of key signatures, but there's no verification
of PRZ's or JIS's keys.  One has to prime the mesh somehow.
I personally prime it by having some keys (or fingerprints) exchanged face
to face with people I know -- and having others acquired by association
with signed messages (b).  I don't have any yet whose trust has been
acquired by attribution (a), since we don't have that machinery set up yet.
BTW -- PGP currently lacks a way for me to note, when I sign a key, how it
is that I trust that key (by personal meeting, by attribution, by message
association, ...).  A signed attribute record would let me record that
information for myself as well as for others.
Here I'm talking about people I "meet" and "get to know" based strictly on
my own e-mail conversations with them.  For such people, there is no other
evidence.  If it weren't for those messages, these people effectively
wouldn't exist in my world.  These messages define the people in question.
Stated another way:  I want to communicate with Alice.  I don't want to
communicate with Bob.  I've never met Alice but I have an address for her
and a public key.
shows Bob as an active eavesdropper, controlling all of Alice's channels,
blocking release of her real key, announcing a key he controls under her
name to the rest of the world.  By contrast,
shows Bob as Alice's secretary, who has been given the job, by Alice, of
reading all Alice's mail, choosing which to pass along to her and answering
all the others.  Alice has generated a key for herself and has given the
private key to Bob so that he can sign for her and read all her mail.
Alice could even have that key certified as hers within some massive X.509
hierarchy -- doing that before she gave the private key to Bob.
I know of no crypto protocol which will distinguish one from the other
unless I have a private channel to Alice at some time -- but that
contradicts the original assumption that I've never met her.
In both cases, the person I think of as Alice is really
and that's the "person" I learn to trust or not to trust.  That's the
"person" for whom I attach an alias to the public key.

That's today's method, more or less.  It doesn't address my needs.  The
name you pick for your key may or may not mean anything to me.  It might be
pronounceable, giving it some advantage over a radix-64 string, but it
might also be non-unique, making it worthless as an identifier.
What means something to me is whatever name (or symbol) I assign to the
person behind the key in question.  That's the one in my mind and therefore
the only one of interest to me.  You, however, don't know what's in my

I don't see a computer-understandable way to do that either -- but you have
provided an example of a human-readable way in your prior paragraph:
You could sign a small message consisting of:

be humans who could interpret it, but in the end it's humans who need to.
The computer should be able to find and use (b) and (c) -- but leave the

In this case, the text attached to the key is optional -- but there for the
people who feel attached to their names.  It's left off (or replaced with a

The fact remains that the key is the source of authority here.  The name
acquires validity from the key, not the other way around, and that might
upset some people who bother to think about it.  However, those who prefer
to think the name is important can view the key hash as an added field
making the name unique -- with the extra added bonus of being tied strongly

I was all set to scream, when I read this first sentence.  Then I read on.
At this point, I realized that we agree in evaluation but not in weighting.
Twice now, I have had to deal with X.509 certificates in real code and it
is excruciatingly painful -- especially for someone, like me, with some
background in performance engineering and much background in software
ASN.1 is not merely ambiguous, it is actively wrong as part of a design
methodology.  It encourages people to define structures in the BNF style --
and they do (witness X.509).  When you translate this into C or PASCAL
structures by an automatic translator, you end up with structures whose
definitions are nested so deeply that even with short field names you would
have variable names which occupy a substantial part of a line of text.
However, ASN.1's BNF-ness encourages people to use
longNamesWithEmbeddedCapitals -- so you end up with variable names which
turn routine C function calls into multi-line, unreadable blocks.
You also end up with too much code.  I recently had to deal with X.509
certs for an authentication application (a firewall proxy).  The proxy was
about 30KB of code prior to the ASN.1.  The ASN.1 code, just to do packing
and parsing, was over 100KB (.o file sizes, in both cases).
You also end up with too many bytes being transferred.  I worked out an
example of ASN.1 abuse -- defining a triple-DES key structure for
encrypting and transmittal -- as a raw C structure (following long
established practice and performance engineering (an array of unsigned
char, with offsets for each key and the IV)) and as ASN.1 (following modern
ASN.1 practice).  The raw C structure was 32 bytes long.  The ASN.1
structure was 86 bytes.  Worse was the code dedicated to structure
definition and packing/unpacking.  In the raw C case, it took 48 ASCII
characters to define the structure and its offsets (including comments) and
nothing to pack/unpack.  With ASN.1, it took 55085 characters of
definition, pack and unpack code.  This is a factor of 1148 in source code
I could go on at length, and have in other fora.  Not only is ASN.1 clearly
the work of Satan, the Distinguished Name definition is more than a victim
of ASN.1 generality, it is a clear reason for the unpopularity of systems
which use it.  Do you remember when X.400 names started showing up in
e-mail (e.g., with Lotus Notes).  How many of those names do you see now?
It didn't work.  The concept is flawed -- but it lives on in X.509.  [It
reminds me of a flaky grad student's idea of a way to do things -- elevated
to standard before people had the chance to try it and discover how
completely bogus it was.]
It is possible to implement something which reads and writes ASN.1 -- but
it is ugly, it inflates your code and it hurts your runtime.  I would like
to see as many hold-outs against ASN.1 and Distinguished Names as possible.
PGP is one such.  TIS/MOSS has learned its lesson (from PEM days) and is
making all of the ASN.1 and DN stuff (X.509) optional.  With luck, the
X.509 parts will die away (although MOSS was retarded so strongly in the
PEM days that it may never recover -- may never acquire the market share to
make it a force).  I would strongly encourage others to join the battle.
This might not be easy.  It is clear that there is an ASN.1 juggernaut.  It
is taking over all sorts of standards.  I believe I know why.  It makes the
job of the standards writer easier.  However, I also believe it needs to be
fought...not merely to save future S/W development efforts from the waste
and abuse which ASN.1 creates, but also to take a stand against the process
by which non-implementors get together on standards committees and come out
with standards which preclude good software architectures -- and who, in a
kind of old-boy-network, endorse other standards (e.g., the ISO set) as
part of their own.  Such a design process is destructive.

X.509 certificates are not totally bad.  Their structure contains lessons
for anyone designing a certificate structure.  [Raw X.509 does not imply a
hierarchy, I believe.  Steve Kent & Co. do.]
However, there are also some serious problems with X.509 certs, aside from
their use of ASN.1.
Perhaps the biggest problem is the use of a name -- a text string (or some
abortion like the DN which can be reduced to a text string) -- as the
anchor point.
This anchor point needs to be unique.  Since it is just a text string, that
means that the certificate authority needs to guarantee uniqueness.
However, it is also supposed to stand for a unique individual.  Since it is
not that individual's DNA sequence -- it is not testable.  There has to be
machinery set up outside the certificate definition for binding this text
string to its individual.
PGP certificates have the same problem.  In that case, it is an e-mail
address and name (by tradition) as the text string.  That needs to be bound
to some physical body.  If it is an e-mail name, there is some binding
enforced by whatever access mechanisms protect access to that e-mail
account.  However, that binding is weak and also outside the certificate
Let me propose an alternative unique name: the public key (or a good hash
of it).  The public key has an advantage over both X.509 and PGP names.
The binding between it and its human being is testable.  You can challenge
the human in question to sign something.
Assuming you use a public key as the unique name, you end up with a much
simplified certificate.  In fact, the notion of "certificate" may go away,
in the sense that the certificate binds a key to a person through a unique
name.  The person binds himself to his key, on challenge (or on any message
What remains is a need for attributes to be bound to a key.  For example,
someone might testify that E0414C79B5AF36750217BC1A57386478 has brown hair,
is balding and wears a pony tail, by signing a message to that effect.
Someone else might sign a message stating that the person who owns the
private key of 61E2DE7FCB9D7984E9C8048BA63221A2 is authorized to spend
money from bank account number 07123 of Provident Savings in Columbia MD.
That latter signator needs to be verified as authorized to make such an
assertion -- and you end up with a certification chain -- but it is not
hierarchical like X.509 and it is not web-of-trust -- it is relational.  It
is not a chain binding key to person but key's person to attribute or
permission.  It goes directly to what we need to accomplish without the
middleman -- without stopping at a person in the middle.
I realize that if you want to revoke a key, then it might help to have
bindings be to something other than the key.  That way, you can change keys
out from under the binding.  However, every method I've examined for
accomplishing that has security weaknesses.  The best method I've found yet
has a very long signature key -- used only rarely (e.g., when acquiring an
attribute-certificate worth a great deal; and signing more transient keys) --
and never normally revoked (or, if revoked, causing a widespread
re-establishment of bindings -- like when you lose your wallet today).
Current certificates are going down a fundamentally wrong path.  They are
trying to bind keys to people and let Society somehow bind attributes to
people -- but the latter binding is too weak to permit keys to be bound to
attributes or permissions.
The community will discover this, soon, but the farther we play along the
X.509 path (especially, but also the PGP path), the more inertia there will
be to overcome in trying to fix this problem.  I would therefore suggest
that the PGP development process address this issue now and continue the
established habit of taking the lead into sanity.

I see no problem using a hash.  I might use SHA rather than MD5.  MD5 is a
wee bit too short.  But, for what we're doing, MD5 is just fine -- and as a
hash of a public key, the cost of finding alternatives is high enough that
MD5's shortness probably isn't a problem.

You're right that my proposal was not concrete at all.  To make it
concrete, you'd want to specify the signed message which takes the place of
a certificate.  I tried this once before, roughly, but I never gave it the
effort it deserves.
Let me call this non-certificate a blurk (waiting for a real name).
For example, you need to identify:
the signee (a public key or hash of a key)
the signer (a public key or hash of a key -- as used in the blurk which

the signature (in some algorithm)  [You might want to allow for multiple
The entire thing could be a signed cleartext message:
Alternatively, you could modify the PGP UserID field (or make something
very similar) with raw text (not treated as an ID on the key) and a sig on
the text and signed key.
Signing a cleartext message has some appeal.
As for how this would be used -- my guess from looking at X.509 is that
it's meant for machine parsing and understanding (although I know of no
programs which follow them beyond sig checking).  A cleartext signed
message requires human reading and filing.  However, that's fine.  After
all, it is a human who decides whether to act or not.
If there is a computer deciding whether to act based on the blurk, the
signed text could include SMTP-style tagged text lines for the program to
go find.
Looking forward to more concrete elaborations....

The whole issue of CRLs is on shaky ground with me.  I think it's gotten
lost in debates about how to distribute them offline (or perhaps via
e-mail) and have them work.
CRLs are like the old credit card or check stop lists which used to be at
every supermarket checkout station.  They aren't there any more.
Checkout stations are now on-line.
I see nothing wrong with having a "certificate" which says ``certificate
available online only at xxx at yyy.zzz''.
Yup -- and it's ugly.  It counts on a defined OBJECT ID to define the
attribute.  That means that if you want to say something about a person
("Boy, she's good looking!") you need to get someone tied to the OBJID
hierarchy to issue you a number.  If that number is low enough in the
tree, (is long enough), then you have the problem that no one knows
what it means.  For that matter, even numbers high in the tree are
unknown to me.  I've never seen a dictionary of OBJECT IDs.
Clearly.  One should never wait for ISO.  In fact, ISO should probably be
ignored from now on.  (Have you seen on-line Dilbert today?)
but back to the question: the slack to use other mechanisms is the weak
link I was talking about.  You are building a chain from attribute or
permission or authorization over to a person where one link (certificate)
is a steel link and the other (binding to person) is mercerized cotton.  If
you want to strengthen the second link, you have to do things like the
national ID card -- or restrict the second link to corporate use (the
current approach) -- or otherwise regiment the human body in physical
space.  By chaining directly from key to authorization, the human can be
anonymous in physical space while still being known in cyberspace.
The thing to avoid is the following:
The only way to make that determination is to look at the text string and
the list of other people who have signed it -- to see if I think they might
know a different Bill Stewart from the person I know.  But then, since I
don't know Bill Stewart at all (except by postings), that's irrelevant to
me.  Therefore, I can not meet that test.  However, there is no reason for
me to reject your key as invalid.  What's invalid is the assumption that
there must be a relationship (or even a person) in physical space *before*
one can have a relationship (or a person) in cyberspace.
I prefer text.  I didn't say it had to be free form -- only that it had to
include free form so that I could say, from one human to another, something
which no one had anticipated and sign that.
If you want a machine to read it, you can use SMTP-style "tag: value".
The idea that machine readability requires binary transfer and/or ASN.1
encoding (e.g., OBJECT IDs) is ludicrous.
I looked at your keys, just now, and see a whole bunch of keys but no
statements like:
"this person is allowed to withdraw money from bank account 017123 of xxx"
"this person is a trusted co-conspirator in the group called Cypherpunks"
anything else useful to me.
I tried adding an informative UserID to my key on the MIT server -- and
it came out as my primary ID.  ...big mistake..
Exactly.  Back to my point: the fact that you're named ``Bill Stewart'' and
are a person is probably important to you -- but if I'm accepting your
e-check, I don't give a damn about either.  What I care about is whether
the signature on the e-check (ie., the public key) is certified by the
bank.  In checking that authorization (attribute), I don't need to refer to
a person's name.  That's an irrelevant step in the process, brought on by
the way X.509 and PGP both define certificates.

Yup.  Verisign is probably going to fight hard to keep their certificate
model.  On top of them, there's the US Postal Service and a few others,
fighting over the chance to set up a certificate hierarchy.
The whole world is thinking of physical people and of tying things to those
people.  They think of names as the only handle on (pointer to) people.
...so they see certificates as right and proper.  We need to show them a
better way.  (Tie attributes through the key to the person -- not through
the person to the key.)
As several have pointed out, a certificate structure (X.509, PGP or mine)
can be used in a hierarchy, if you want it, or not if you don't.  We don't
care.  What I care about is that a signed thing (one link in a chain of
assertions) speak directly to what it is signing ("this key is good for
_________") or ("the person who demonstrated to me that he knew the private
key for this key has red hair and wore glasses") -- rather than try to
sidle up to existing people structures (by tying to names of people) and
then, on discovering that the people-structures aren't as strong as the
digital signatures, make the people structures stronger (e.g., by unique ID
number on a national ID card, with thumbprints for verification).
Yes -- I agree.  We should get cracking on this.
I'm still talking web of trust -- only I'm removing the person's name (or
e-mail address) as a link between the assertion and the key.
Haven't I described this well enough?  Do I need to write it up in more
How about some analogies?
I could have a driver's license (giving my name and address), a piece of
paper saying that I (at my address) own bank account number 01732 at First
Security Bank, and a certificate from Verisign also giving my name and
address.  This ties my public key to my driver's license (assuming I'm the
only Carl Ellison at my address (which I wasn't, as a kid) and that I don't
Alternatively, I can have First Security Bank open account 01732 for me and
create a certificate binding my public key to that account number.  Now, I
can use that key to sign anonymous checks.  (The bank knows me, perhaps,
but the payee doesn't need to.)  To tie my name to the public key, I sign
my own certificate saying ``The person who knows the private key for
61E2DE7FCB9D7984E9C8048BA63221A2 goes by the name "Carl Ellison" and
receives mail at "cme at acm.org".''  I don't need anyone else to attest to
the validity of that statement because it's uni-directional (from key to my
name), not the other way.  It's only the other assertion direction which
requires some witnesses to attest to validity, because the name is not
capable of doing a digital signature without a key.  [That is, if you were
to go the other direction (which is what X.509 or PGP try to do), you need
to sign a key with a name (DN or UserID).  You can't sign with a DN or
UserID.  You can sign with a key.  So, you have to fall back on human
witnesses to use their keys to sign in place of the name (DN or UserID) and
you have to decide how to trust those witnesses.  If you reverse the arrow
of assertion, this particular problem goes away.]

The response does *not* need to be signed.  If you want rock solid
authentication which you can save for later use in court (e.g., buying an
airplane?), you might insist on a digital signature.  However, all you need
is for the path from the person who knows (AmEx's computer) to your cash
register to be trusted.  There are lots of ways to establish trust.
E.g., you could encrypt the path with a session key (triple-DES) chosen by
the cash register and sent at the beginning of the day to AmEx using AmEx's
public key.  Now anything coming back under that symmetric key is
effectively authenticated.
OBJECT IDs are by no means even a sensible way to achieve this end.  SMTP's
tags work very nicely, thank you, and they allow people to define their own
for private-joke extensions to the protocol.  (I did just that for e-mail
access to the TIS DRC.)

Strong crypto does a better job of keeping outsiders out.
Things like TIS CKE are mechanisms for making sure that insiders continue
to get in, in spite of mishaps with their keys.
Any such system can be evaluated on its technical merits (does it really
separate the insiders from the outsiders as well as it claims to?) (does it
survive various disasters (because if it doesn't survive, it can't keep
insiders in)?)
This is a separate topic from GAK -- which boils down to the Government's

It depends on how you define certificate.  If you define it this way, then
I'm proposing the elimination of certificates (because I'm eliminating the
unique name as something different from a key).
If you define certificate as I do -- as a bound statement of some attribute
of a key, then it should become clearer.  It's just that the attribute I'm
binding is not some unique person-name -- rather something like permission
to spend money from a bank account.
The rest should be more clear if you read the rest of the backlog....

We're not talking about giving up on names.
You have lots of names for things -- some of them are even nicknames, known
only to you.
For any certification scheme, you also need a unique name.
If you happen to use the public key as that unique name, you have the
proposal we're talking about.  It has an advantage -- that you don't
have to certifiy the binding between the unique name and the key.
That's built in.

@_subject: Diane Rehm Show just ended 
You just finished a show on terrorism (WAMU, 10-11am, 10/26/95).  Thank you.
Some of your callers said most of what I would have said and I found that
pleasing, since I wasn't able to call in.
However, there was a theme which kept coming up and which wasn't addressed
specifically.  You might hold it in mind for future shows on terrorism:
This seems to be a major problem and perhaps the source of the concern
about civil liberties.
Terrorism might be a product of an organized, identified group and
infiltration of that group might enable the FBI to prevent acts of
violence.  Of course, the permission to infiltrate suspicious groups has
been used in the past to justify infiltration of non-violent but unpopular
groups like the Sanctuary Movement.
However, many of our recent terrorist acts appear to be the result of
individual actions -- not those of organized groups.  [Unabomber, OK City,
train derailment] Infiltration is out of the question in such cases.  The
only way to prevent such acts is to put the entire population of the US
under surveillance -- an authentic instance of Big Brother from 1984.
The conclusion to me is that we can not task the FBI with the job of
prevention of terrorism.  I suspect that we must insure that the FBI is
formally and carefully restricted to the job of investigating and
prosecuting crimes once they occur -- allowing the threat of almost certain
prosecution to serve as a prevention -- rather than with the impossible job
of prevention of such crimes.
Meanwhile, there was one question I had that no one answered:
I didn't like history much as a student, but I vaguely remember other
periods of domestic terrorism: bombings in the early 1900s, acts of
violence associated with the labor movement, sabotage during WW-I conducted
by German agents.  There may have been many others.  This seems to be a
feature of life -- nothing recent, nothing special, frightening from its
news coverage but not a serious threat to any one individual (because of
the actual statistics around the threat -- comparing my chance of injury
due to auto accident, plane flight or terrorist act (for example)).  It
would be interesting to know why we had the pause in terrorism during the
Cold War -- or, for that matter, if we actually did.  Could it be that the
apparent return of terrorism is actually a perception rather than a fact --
as a result of shift in focus of the news media?

The same danger happens with the TIS DRC (see the company web page), even
though there is no key escrow in the TIS system.  Instead, the emergency
access field (Data Recovery Field (DRF)) is stored with the file -- but the
key which encrypts it is the public key of the Data Recovery Center (DRC).
If too much attractive stuff is available by loss of any one public key,
that key gets attacked.  To compensate for this, the TIS DRC generates new
public keys periodically to give out to new (or old) customers.
However, a government warrant which demands the DRC's private key collection
would gain quite a harvest.

Yes, some are -- especially at higher levels.  LEAs in the field (by my
informal survey) are not.  They're worried instead about manpower and normal
tools (e.g., computers back at the station, radios, ...).
Meanwhile, there is an advantage for LEAs when criminals have, for example,
encrypting phones.  A phone itself gives the person using it a sense of
privacy.  [This is probably a side effect of the psychological cues which
result from using a handset.  If you pull a handset away from your ear or
mouth very far, you can't converse.  Someone standing in the same room as
you probably can not hear the words you hear in your ear.  If the handset
were another person, this behavior would be called "whispering" --
something done to achieve privacy.]
An encrypting phone (or e-mail for that matter) gives the impression (and,
to some extent, reality) of extra privacy.
When there is a perception of privacy, the people conversing are more
likely to reveal things which they don't want overheard.  If these people
are ciminals, those things might be used as evidence against them.
The advantage for LEAs comes from the fact that the person at the other end
of the line might well be an LEA in disguise.  This is especially true on
the Internet (or on AOL, to cite a recent case), where the other person may
well be someone you have never met and therefore haven't checked out to
verify level of criminality.
'key escrow' is a code word for government access to the unencrypted

There are two important differences.
The first difference is in ownership of the data.  If the source of the
link decides to clobber the file, then the fact that I have a page with the

Similarly, the person owning the file can freely change the content of the
file, without my changing the URL which points to it.
The other difference is in handling of the data.  If the link were to
a pornographic image and someone were to access it through my page's URL,
the bits of that image would never touch my computer.
Meanwhile,  RSA encryption system
in PERL  might be a URL which violates US export laws -- if this
interpretation were to be taken -- but if so, does it violate them in this

of URLs and turns them into point-and-click units.  Is it a violation if

The CRYPTO conference sounds like a better alleged violation of export --
unless you take your shirt off and give it to the furrener or lie down on
his scanner to scan your bar codes (or maybe let him take a picture of
the bar codes). :-)
It was the late 70's when an over-enthusiastic person from NSA complained
to the IEEE that it was about to hold a conference including foreign
nationals at which crypto would be discussed.  This is clearly in violation
of the ITAR (dissemination of controlled technical data).  The IEEE
generally thumbed its nose at the NSA person and shortly thereafter (1980)
the ICAR was founded and CRYPTO conferences were held.
CRYPTO includes multiple attendees from the crypto services of (former)
(?current?) unfriendly governments.  (is France friendly? :-) It also has
multiple NSA attendees -- so it's not going on in secret from the gov't.
Well ...
I was at an AFCEA talk about export rules about 1.5 years ago and met a
special agent from Customs.  I asked him for Customs' policy on export of
crypto S/W and technical data by USENET News, FTP and WWW.  He seemed very
interested -- wanted my phone number -- was going to come out to visit to
see these sites offering this stuff.
He never came out.
I started e-mailing him asking him whether he was going to come get a tour
of the net -- and he stopped replying.
I can only assume that when he thought it was a single incident (like PRZ)
which could be tracked, he might follow it -- but when I started talking
about dozens or hundreds of people involved (e.g., all US persons talking
crypto techniques on sci.crypt) he lost interest.  I was going to show him
the MIT and TIS sites which release crypto code.  (Those sites have letters
from the State Dept. saying that what we do to restrict export is OK --
even if it is the honor system.)  I was going to show him how easy it is to
get crypto from overseas.
As I said, he lost interest.
