The white cells rush in to disinfect the gangreen.  They should learn to
be less obvious (or start polluting our water with more lead so we dont
notice things like these).  Once genetic engineering is perfected they
will no longer have to worry about strong-willed citizen units anymore.

@_subject: Paradoxical bandwidth 'law' with anonymizing systems? 
Another way to defeat traffic analysis is to maintain a constant stream of
traffic between servers, some of which is noise.. Only someone with the
decryption key would be able to determine which is noise and which is
signal (hopefully).  Pipenet's description involved this constant stream.. It may have been one of the resource-consuming aspects that the designers
of onion routing wanted to get rid of.
I have been thinking of anonymous packet resenders recently, and one of
the problems that confronted me was that regardless of how much encrypted
traffic goes between the resender systems, an organization with enough
resources could watch for "unknown" incoming connections at each of the
known resenders and match that with the outgoing connection if there
aren't too many people connected.. The organization could even force some
type of DOS on the incoming connections until the outgoing connection also
dropped (revealing the sender's identity), although I suppose the outgoing
packets could continue to be sent by the resenders in the case of a
dropped connection.  Putting the right stuff in the packets would be
difficult, though. To make it more difficult for such an organization to discover a sender's
identity, I thought that if anonymous connections could not be depended on
to be numerous enough, the entry points to the resender system could also
maintain popular web/ftp/mail sites which accepted requests with hidden
packet transmission requests.  Of course, this would make packet
sending/receiving very expensive, and the increased traffic coming from
one IP and destined to mostly anonymous resenders might make it stand out
from the regular connections.. but the identity tracker's job has been
made harder (since he must analyze large amounts of incoming traffic), and
the entry points to the resender system can be said to receive mostly
"innocent" data.
Any comments/ideas?

Wasn't Kevin Mitnick tracked down by triangulating the location of his

seems that the tools to do so are already out there.. Of course, idle cell

If someone wanted to passively track everyone's position all the time,
there would need to be at least two direction-sensitive cell towers
covering each area, listening to the same calls all the time. There would
need to be at least three to properly locate someone walking along the
line between two towers.. That seems a bit expensive, unless enough overlapping tower ranges already
exist to do something like that.  The owners of the towers would probably
much prefer that the cell phones come equipped with a GPS. On cell "remailers": Why resend the cell signal?  Why not instead set up a
generic phone call resender, which could be used by cell users and
non-users alike?  As long as you use the call resender for all of your
important calls, the feds (and others) will find it very difficult to
figure out what cell phone ID to triangulate or home phone number to tap

BACK * 22 April 1998
   _________________________________________________________________
         WASHINGTON, DC--In an effort to streamline degradation of the
   American populace and consolidate all forms of bureaucratic hassle
   into one convenient mailing, federal officials announced Monday that,
   beginning in 1999, the government will issue all citizens an annual
   "Screw You" packet.
         The packet, which is to be distributed in conjunction with
   federal tax forms, will condense the government's countless methods of
   abuse into a single handy 9x12 envelope.
         "The federal government's current citizen-persecution system is
   inefficient and wasteful," said Sen. Alfonse D'Amato (R-NY), who
   spearheaded the congressional task force that developed the "Screw
   You" packet. "This compact packet is not only cost-effective, it's
   user-friendly and intuitive. Simple instructions and easy-to-remember
   acronyms make the filing process as quick and painless as possible."
         The packet's easy-to-understand forms will free citizens of the
   nightmare of red tape normally associated with federal filings.
   Filling out and returning the "Screw You" packet is mandatory and
   easy. Here's how:
         The first step is to calculate your Economic Mobility Factor
   using the convenient EMF 1138 calculation sheet included in the
   packet. Those with an Economic Mobility Factor of 90 or above may mail
   or fax forms SC0089-L and SC0065-DD to their local Screw You EMF
   Processing Center. They may also drop them off at SYEMFPC kiosks
   conveniently set up at post offices and public libraries across the
   U.S.
         Those with an EMF between 30 and 90 must submit their forms in
   person to a Screw You EMF Processing Center Clerk. Such applicants
   must meet with the SYEMFPCC, and should arrange appointments via the
   State Application Auditing Appointment Bureau. Once an appointment
   date has been set by the SAAAB, a Screw You Appointment Confirmation
   Card will be mailed to you within three to four weeks.
         Upon receipt of the Screw You Appointment Confirmation Card,
   applicants will be required to register the appointment with the Screw
   You Appointment Registry Bureau. Failure to register the appointment
   within a 48-hour period will result in a fine automatically added to
   your estimated SYEMF-1138 quotient.
         The amount of the fine can be determined by using Screw You
   Fine/ Penalty Schedule 565612, which is available at all local
   Department of Fiduciary Adjustment branch offices. If there is no DFA
   office in your immediate Screw You zone, district, state or township,
   you should contact the Federal Department of Fiduciary Adjustments in
   Washington, D.C., and ask to speak to a Citizen's Outreach
   Representative who will look up the predetermined fine on
   SYF/PS565612.
         There is a $50 processing fee for any and all telephone queries
   to the FDFA. Those wishing to charge the $50 fee can do so by making
   three copies of forms SYEMF-1138, KSJU-387-SK, SKSP-90-EZ, and
   SC-2389, along with computer code 0100010 and ACC-842, and forwarding
   them to the Federal Department of Fiduciary Adjustments Postal
   Processing Center in Colorado Springs, CO.
         Forms received by the FDFAPPC will be processed and returned to
   applicants within six to eight weeks. Those who wish to have their
   forms returned in less than six to eight weeks may file a Fiduciary
   Calculation Acceleration Form 9056 at their local SYEMFPC.
         FCAF-9056 forms will be available Monday to Tuesday between the
   hours of 7:45 a.m. and 8:15 a.m., and are distributed on a first-come,
   first-serve basis. Completed forms should be returned to the FDFA in
   Washington, DC. All FCAF-9056 forms that have not cleared
   authentication via the FDFA in Washington, DC, will be rendered null
   and void, and will not be forwarded to the FDFAPPC in Colorado
   Springs.
         Applicants who misdirect their FCAF-9056 forms will draw a $10
   per SYEMF-1138 fine. The fine must be paid within 36 hours, or the
   applicant will be subject to house arrest and strip-search by the
   Armed Outreach Response Team, an independently operated division of
   the Screw You Outreach Consortium.

Or, delay the return signal and use a paraboloid reflector.  This would
limit a spy's knowledge to the angle from the tower that you were
transmitting from, and the maximum distance from the tower that you could
be sitting at.  The paraboloid reflector would limit the ability for
someone to triangulate your location, depending on how narrow the beam is
focused.. Of course, if they really wanted to find you, they would walk
along the line of transmission until they ran right into you :).
Sure, the average joe is not going to go to the trouble of modifying his
cell phone and using a paraboloid reflector.. and even if he did, a
remailer type of system would be much more secure.  I guess the average
unaware joe is just going to have to get used to being shafted as a result
of his ignorance.  Isn't that how it's always been?
Question: How could true anarchy be guaranteed for stupid people like Joe?
