@_subject: Andy Grove on Clipper 
Andy Grove (CEO/Intel), Dan Sussman (? -- I think that's his name, he was an editor at Newsweek), and Reed Hundt from the FCC.  As can be expected, it was another talk show about the "Data Superhighway".  It got interesting on two points:
the Data Superhighway and he told Larry that since Al Gore was on the show, he'd rather get into what he thought the Feds _shouldn't_ do and discussed the path towards universal access to PC's without any federal involvement.  Al Gore tried to get involved by arguing that the Fed's were originally responsible for the computer revolution b/c of the Apollo program.  The two hit back and forth a couple of times on the issue.  At this point, I was patting Andy on the back for being a non-statist.
Superhighway" the Clipper chip had to be discussed.  He then went on to say (and occasionally apologizing to Gore for being blunt) how the chip and the whole program were "loathed" by the industry and privacy advocates.  Larry asked Groves what he thought about it and he went off talking about the govt's legitimate right to tap analog media and how all this chip did was to extend that right into the digital realm.  I was shocked.  Even worse, Al Gore supported Andy's position and then when Larry King got back to the editor, he backed off saying "well, I just heard that people in the industry didn't like it." Larry asked for his opinion on it as a provider of information services and he said, "we just report on public opinions in our magazine and don't try to take positions on the issues.
