USPS interdiction of routers, computers, packages and mail has little over sight. USPS attempted to censor report of failure to follow safeguards.

Glad to hear there is legal assistance and a database without being charged attorney hourly fees. I will sign up with MuckRock.

As far as "where to get it", here's a copy: I apologize for belatedly thanking you for TextSecure download link. Two days ago, I downloaded it despite the browser warning the certificate was not valid: "ngrok.com:61924 uses an invalid security certificate. The certificate is not trusted because it is self-signed. The certificate is only valid for isadora-amd64 (Error code: sec_error_unknown_issuer)"
 I installed TextSecure on my Droid 3 which does have a cellular account. TextSecure works if airplane mode is not on. Turning airplane mode on and wifi on, TextSecure does not work. Yet, description of TextSecure is that it works over wifi, data and/or SMS.
 I installed TextSecure on my Motorola droid 4. I use Droid 4 as a PDA. No cellular account. How can I get TextSecure to work over wifi? Badbiosvictim, formerly bluelotus

Yes. I have a $80 a year plan with page plus cellular on my older Droid 3 phone. During the installation of TextSecure on Droid 3, TextSecure didn't ask for a cell phone number to register. How to register a number?

'Data channel' includes wifi?
Your TS version works fine on activated Droid 3 in SMS only mode. Thanks.

You are correct. I will use older TextSecure on my activated phone. Works
On my unactivated "PDA,"I will continue to email my contacts
cellular text address unless I convince my contacts to use peerio or
chatsecure or subrosa.

I appreciate your suggestion. My Motorola Droid has android 4.1. Thanks.
