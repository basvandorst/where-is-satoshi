This assumes that writing and selling proprietary software is 'the ability
control other people'.  I fail to see why this would be the case.  Free
is a good thing, but people *choose* to accept the restrictions of non-free
software for any number of reasons.  I do not see anyone being coerced into
using it by threat of physical force.
