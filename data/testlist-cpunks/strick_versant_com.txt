Visa, HNC Inc. develop neural network as a weapon to fight fraud
SAN FRANCISCO (AUG. 10) PR NEWSWIRE - Visa International and HNC Inc. have
announced a strategic agreement to develop a comprehensive merchant risk
detection system.  The new system will be designed to better control fraud at
the merchant level by determining the risk associated with individual card
This agreement continues to support Visa International's active role in
developing effective solutions to the problem of fraud occurring at the point
of sale.  The merchant risk detection system will be available in 1994.
"Visa has combined its core systems capabilities and the premier technology
available -- neural networks -- for fighting credit card fraud," explained
Roger Peirce, Visa International's executive vice president, Delivery Systems.
"HNC, an industry leader in neural network applications and credit card
control services, is a logical partner for Visa," he added.
Michael A. Thiemann, HNC's executive vice president, called the agreement
"another example of our commitment to solving tough business problems through
the application of cutting-edge technologies."
Neural network technology enables a system to predict the probability of fraud
by learning from a large number of past transactions, both legitimate and
fraudulent.  By using neural networks to its full extent, Visa will be able to
provide superior risk analysis for its members.
In combating credit and debit card fraud, Visa already has developed several
programs utilizing information gained from neural network research.  Worldwide
implementation of the International Points-of- Compromise (IPOC) program has
proved highly effective for identifying merchant locations that may be selling
or giving account information to counterfeiters.  Another successful program,
called the Central Deposit Monitoring (CDM) program, matches merchant activity
with sales draft laundering characteristics and identifies unusual merchant
deposits. In addition, close cooperation with law enforcement agencies and
legislatures enhances the value of the programs which, in turn, allow Visa
members to pass on the protection to its cardholders and merchants.
The planned Visa-HNC merchant risk detection system is designed to further
reduce fraud losses by assigning a risk score to each authorization
transaction processed through the VisaNet systems.  "With this new system,
members will be better able to assess risk at the point- of-transaction and,
therefore, make more informed authorization decisions," confirmed Peirce.
According to The Nilson Report, merchant fraud worldwide cost the financial
industry an estimated US $689 million in 1992.
HNC will integrate the risk score into Falcon(TM), their existing, real-time
credit card fraud-detection system that runs at card issuer sites to identify
and prevent a wide range of fraud at the cardholder level. It determines the
probability of fraud on each credit card authorization by comparing it to the
cardholder's purchase patterns and the latest trends in credit card fraud.
Introduced in September 1992, Falcon has already achieved success in reducing
fraud losses of major credit card issuers.
HNC Inc., the world's leader in the application of neural networks, develops,
sells, integrates and supports advanced decision solutions based on neural
network and statistical technology. HNC provides practical products and
services to the financial, credit card, debit card, merchant services,
insurance, mortgage underwriting, retail and direct marketing industries.
Visa is the leading consumer payment system in the world with more than 10.4
million acceptance locations, the largest global ATM network and 309 million
cards issued worldwide.

#            Port=+
# #        This is usually used by other types  of  gateway  scripts.
#        For instance, The first script might take a search and get
#        a few hits.  It could then generate  "exec"  scripts  that

Yeah, let's write some code!
"TCL" is my language of choice for this -- it was designed specifically
for wrapping other libraries and embedding inside other tools. I've been wanting to build the crypto-toolkit, too, and have started with RSAREF wrappers.
There's a nice TCP module for TCL that lets you implement clients and
servers.  There's also the "TK" X-windows toolkit, for seamless graphical interfaces to TCL stuff.
Ftp to sprite.berkeley.edu and ftp down TCL or TK (which will include TCL).
(A lot of people may suggest perl, but perl was designed with a different
set of goals in mind.)

# > portable beyond belief.
It should be at two layers.  TCL (pronounced "tickle") is merely a
layer on top of C.  (By the way, GENERIC TCL is Plain Old C, and Portable Beyond Belief.  A
lot more portable than mediocre C.  GENERIC TCL is an  that shuts
off all commands that use any operating system services (besides
malloc() and free()) -- it's merely a string-based language
interpreter, with designed with friendly conventions for adding new
commands that are wrappers of C API.  Supplement GENERIC TCL with
some stdio.h routine wrappers (fopen, fclose, fgets, fputs), and you'll
be happy.  Compiled instantly on my macintosh, even.)
# I agree. By having a good toolkit in C, we'd have an easy time not
# just prototyping applications but building real and portable ones.
Yes, you want a complete C api.    I don't argue against that.
First you assemble your C API at a complete layer.  It'll look a lot
like the RSAREF API.  In fact, the RSAREF portion of it *will be* the
RSAREF API.
You see, RSAREF already is a crypto toolkit.  Not as full as you may
like, but enough to do most basic public-key-cryptosystem stuff.  The
reference implementations of MD2 and MD5 are also part of the C toolkit
API.   And the bignumber packages.  We've already got *lots* of these.
But have you tried using RSAREF API to do anything?  C API are a
notorious pain in the butt to use -- allocating & deallocating memory,
twiddling bits, writing functions to copy one data format to another,
etc.  They're the reason we're not writing code!  When you elevate to a
"scrypting" language, it becomes really easy (even fun) to experiment
and hack stuff together.
# I'd suggest that a streams mechanism, so you could attach various
# processes to a bunch of data in sequence the way unix filters work,
# would also be nice. That way sequences like
# # compress -- des -- tran -- des -- idea -- radix-64ify
# # could be really easily built.
Yes, but now you just suggested Shell and Streams rather than C as the
easy-to-use interface into this kit.
You've rejected then rediscovered the reason for a "scrypting"
language.  I think you don't yet understand how TCL is used.  You'll be
much more productive in TCL than hacking weird data flows and futzing
with temporary files and klutzy syntax and counting your nested escape
and quote characters in Shell.  (Most shell things are not one simple
pipe from front to end.)
There's still a time and a place for shell stuff -- fortunately there
(finally) is a standard "tclsh" unix (or POSIX) main.c that you can use to
mix your TCL scripts with Unix Shell scripts.  (You could do it before,
but it was more of a "test" program or homegrown driver than part of a
standard main.c)
ANYWAY -- I should quit ranting and Just Start Writing Code.
Unfortunately I'll be out of town till early October....
Perhaps I can suggest some specs before then.

I've been spending the week in Washington DC, so I went by the Public

I have photocopies of nearly the complete folders, which include the
initial proposed patent and all the written communication between the
patent attorney and the patent examiner.  (I think all four of these
patents had all of their claims rejected on the first pass.)  You see
the patent examiner explain what is wrong, criticizing the patent, and
the subsequent ammendments and more rejections until the patent is granted.
(This is important information if one wishes to challenge a patent.  You
can see how various arguments were dealt with before and what likely
responses from patent examiners are.)
I'll bring all of this to the October Mountain View cypherpunks
meeting, assuming it is Sat Oct 9.  I'll also try and be ready to
summarize the history of each patent.  What are missing from my copies are mostly legal communications that
had no techincal interest -- powers of attorney & calculations of
fees.   I also omitted most of the published articles that were
referenced (several other patents and some scholarly papers) and some
seemingly redundant diagrams.  Of course, I also have copies of the
final patents granted.

Define some characteristic signature for a paragraph, and some
way to recognize one inside a text file.
Here's my best approach.  Only pay attention to the letters and
numbers [A-Za-z0-9].   Treat everything else as white space.
Use some kind of hashing or checksum to digest the body of
a paragraph.  Ignoring punctuation and newlines lets you recognize a paragraph even if it is quoted or re-fmt'ed.
Define paragraphs to recognize two different formats:
   2.   Lines that are indented more than the previous line
begin new paragraphs.  That will recognize the paragraphs from
here on.
   3.  It would probably also help to recognize some important
things that are not paragraphs of readable text, such as uuencodes
and C source and unreadable PGP blocks.
   The idea, of course, is to keep a database of paragraph
signatures that you have seen, and probably whether or not you
bothered to read it before.  When a new message arrives, it can
be characterized like "18% new, 23% read before, 51% skipped before,
8% not text".
   You still have the problem of finding truncated paragraphs
like the one I quoted at the top of this message.
   Those could be recognized if you did lines instead of
paragraphs.  It would take some experimentation to fine tune.
   Finally, a mailing list itself could remember what has been
sent on it, and attempt to reject large messages of mostly redundant paragraphs.

either.  People buy them because they want to use the phone.
Of course, I blew my anonymity when I tested it, calling my own voicemail.
So give it a try.  Call 1-800-827-9860, PIN 480-500-0400.  For international calls, dial 011-county-city-number.  Cool computer

because that's how you make a new call.
"For additional time or Customer Assistance call 1-800-819-6111".

# # Some of us are participants in the IETF, are even on the IPSEC working

# insist, why not just note that there are drafts pending and not
# forward each of the announcement messages?
If he were to do that,  people would ask (or at least wonder)
and It turns out the announcment is only two or three pages long,
and about 1/3 of it answers question 1, and the other 2/3 answers (for various clients) question 2.
I thought it was a very appropriate way of using the list --
a good comprimise between spamming and being silent.
I was able to quickly determine if I was interested (I was),
and use my favorite way to fetch it (since I'm not in metamail,
I grabbed the URLs and LYNXed them.)

Yeah, there's always neat RFC drafts on security out there;
that hardly needs announceing.  Which ones are new & interesting & why?
# I have already gotten three other copies of each of the three messages
# associated with Ran's new IPng drafts because every security mailing

So the perfect solution, from your point of view,
is that there be no announcement on cyperpunks.
And the perfect solution, from my point of view,
is that you unsubscribe from all those other lists,
so that you only see one announcement.  :)
And the perfect solution, from everyone's point of view,
is to have a real solution to the document-repost problem.
Like a cypherpunk registry web page where you post small
announcements and pointers to things, with the ability
to scan first and see if anyone else has done that.
Then a periodic summary of new stuff gets mailed out
on a regular basis, if there is new stuff to announce.
Sounds like a good web project for someone ...

It would be kind if you sent me a copy of the issues that discuss it.

Nope, that says what I have to say right now.  The followup discussion on Cypherpunks has been helpful to me;
the punks mostly made good points and correct observations.

Microsoft Clarifies Trademark Policies
REDMOND, Washington--January 4, 1995--In response to customer
inquiries, Microsoft today clarified the naming policy for Bob(tm), its
new software product designed for computer beginners.  Contrary to
rumors, Microsoft will not demand that all persons formerly named "Bob"
immediately select new first names.
    "I don't know where these rumors come from," commented Steve
Balmer, Microsoft Executive Vice President for Worldwide Sales and
Support.  "It's ridiculous to think Microsoft would force people
outside the computer industry to change their names.  We won't, and our
licensing policies for people within the industry will be so reasonable
that the Justice Department could never question them."
    Balmer said employees of other computer companies will be given the
opportunity to select new names, and will also be offered a licensing
option allowing them to continue using their former names at very low
    The new licensing program, called Microsoft TrueName(tm), offers
persons who want to continue being known by the name Bob the option of
doing so, with the payment of a small monthly licensing fee and upon
signing a release form promising never to use OpenDoc.  As an added
bonus, Bob name licensees will also be authorized to display the
Windows 95 logo on their bodies.
    Persons choosing not to license the Bob name will be given a 60-day
grace period during which they can select another related name.  "We're
being very lenient in our enforcement of the Bob trademark," said Bill
Newkom, Microsoft's Senior Vice President of Law and Corporate
Affairs.  "People are still free to call themselves Robert, Robby, or
even Rob.  Bobby however is derivative of Microsoft's trademark and
obviously can't be allowed."
    Microsoft also announced today that Bob(tm) Harbold, its Executive
Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, has become the first
Microsoft TrueName licensee and will have the Windows 95 logo tattooed
to his forehead.

# This is technically true, since all public-key work (including RSA) is based

DH uses "discrete log" as the hard problem, and very straightforward
RSA uses "factoring" as the hard problem, and a very clever back door.
How do you decide if one is based on the other?
# public-key technology with Diffie-Hellman public-key in particular, which
# (as I understand it) is not particularly secure.
It's still up in the air, isn't it, whether the discrete log or factoring is the harder to crack.   My intuition is they're the
same hard.
I know of no problem with DH that RSA doesn't have similar problems.

@_subject: Blocks Colon [Re: Internet File System] 
# The other day, it occurred to me that Java could really take off if there
# was some sort of file system.  And, since you can't write to local files
# with Java, the obvious solution is to set up the 'fopen, fclose(), etc)
# set of functions that are 'rpcs' to some server application on the same

Here's my crypto-friendly design for this. Define a new TCP protocol called "Blocks Colon".
It forms URLs like
This protocol is similar to a "block device" in unix,
with basic operations to read and write 512-octet blocks,
named by an integer index.  Other operations are to ask the size of the block file, to change its size, to commit/abort changes,
and session authentication (like a POP server).
Then in the JAVA box you need
So your program uses the filesystem object, which uses
the block encryption filter, which uses the block client,
which goes to your ISP's block service.   The internet and
your ISP sees nothing but encrypted blocks.   The encryption key
never leaves your personal java box.
Your ISP charges you by the block/hour for storage, and by the number
of blocks read/written for network.  You could keep a backup
blocks account at another ISP, and keep the two blocks mirrored
(another filter?) or run occasional backups. What annoys me is that java.io.* defines specific classes for
filesystem access, rather than a "factory class" and thereafter nothing but interfaces.  That makes it difficult to override
the "builtin" notion of a filesystem with network-based or
crypto-based filesystems, without changing your programs,
or tampering with the builtin classes.  :(
