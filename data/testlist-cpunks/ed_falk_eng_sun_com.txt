Hi all; if anybody's interested in having a PGP key-signing party
at this event, I'd be willing to organize one.
If interested, send me your key (or a pointer to where I can download
it), and let me know what times are good for you for the party.

Can't remailers be written with basic spam safeguards?  I.e. no mass
crossposts, limited # of posts by each individual client per day, etc.?

@_subject: ANNOUNCEMNT: February 1997 keysigning session 
We have enough people who want to have a PGP keysigning session at
tommorrow's meeting to make it worthwhile.  We'll probably be doing
it at 17:00 or thereabouts.
If you want to join in, let me know ASAP.  Include your key or a pointer
to where I can download it.

@_subject: Interesting question: how to safely keep passwords online 
Here's a question that's been on my mind lately:  Often, you like
to keep external passwords stored on your personal computer.  As a quick
example, Eudora will remember your POP password for you so you don't
have to enter it every time.  Obviously, Eudora keeps this on disk
The question is: is there any (relatively) safe way to do this?  Obviously,
Eudora encrypt the saved password with some secret key, but this key could
probably be found by examining the code.  A slight improvement would
be for Eudora to generate an encryption key on the fly based on some
external system state, but this is also susceptible to reverse-engineering.

@_subject: Modified Token Posting Scheme 
How about this simple policy scheme:
  1) posts from known list members forwarded to list automatically
  2) posts with "approval cookie" also forwarded automatically
  3) otherwise, forwarded only after approval by moderator, whose charter
People who don't want to use their own name in a post, and also don't
want to be bothered with creating a cookie are the only ones whose posts
are delayed.

Besides, in my scheme, the first two options are explicitly there to
avoid moderation.  Just post under your real name or generate an
authentication cookie.

@_subject: FW: Modified Token Posting Scheme 
No, just the opposite.  My scheme allows people to route around moderation
by authenticating their posts.  The goal here is to keep *random* stuff,
such as spam, off the list.

@_subject: encryption program 
I ran a quick Kappa test on it.  There was a nice fat spike at key
length 25, as somebody else suggested, but an almost perfect
correlation at 100.  The message is almost certainly a simple
polyalphabetic cipher with keylength 100.
I've been playing with it, and have maybe 5% of it decoded.  It's
full of really blatent clues.  Kind of fun.

Someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe it refers to a cipher
where each character is encrypted individually, using a different
monoalphabetic cipher for each one.  The ciphers repeat after
a certain period, usually the key length.
Vigenere is the simplest polyalphabetic cipher of them all, with
the individual ciphers simply being ROT-n.

Kappa test is described in Kahn's "Codebreakers".
Basicly, you take two streams of random text and line them up one over
the other.  Look for letter matches between top and bottom.  The percentage
of matches is called Kappa.
If the text is truly random, you should see matches 1/26 of the time.
However, if the text is english, you should see matches about 6.6% of
the time instead.
Likewise, if the text is encrypted with a monoalphabetic cipher, you
should *also* see matches 6.6% of the time.
Likewise, if the text comes from two different messages encrypted with
the same polyalphabetic cipher (and they're lined up properly) you
again see Kappa = 6.6%.
Finally, if the key repeats, and you've guessed the length of the
repitition correctly, and you line up the ciphertext with itself
accordingly, Kappa will again be 6.6%.
I've been writing my own as I go along; it's more educational to do
it that way.  As been mentioned earlier in this list, there's an
archive of crypto software at
I've been getting ideas from there, but it's more fun to write your own.

Almost all of them.  I saw the keyboard of an IBM thinkpad flipped up
at a party the other day and was flabbergasted.  It's all empty space!
You can add & remove innards all you want.  Disk drives, batteries, etc.
are all removable.  The actual computer itself is so tiny I couldn't
believe it.  You could pull out the CD-rom, floppy disk, spare battery, etc.
and have a nearly empty box that still runs windows and unix.

@_subject: encryption program 
I had a blast with this one.  I was up until 4:30 last night working
on Pierre van Rooyen's "Here follows a example..." cryptogram.  It's
like doing a jigsaw puzzle; there's a hump you cross over near the
end where everything just falls into place.  Jim Gillogly broke it in
only a few hours, whereas I must have put in a whole day cumulatively
(half of that writing software), but it was my first real cryptogram.
It was a hell of a learning experience.  They say that you can't design
a crypto system until you've broken someone else's first, and this really
drove it home.

Hi all; I haven't seen the agenda yet, but if there is time & interest,
I would be willing to organize a PGP key-signing party.
Signify interest by mailing your key -- or a pointer to it -- to me
by Friday.  Come to the c'punks meeting with photo ID and your PGP
It would also be way cool if we could get some of the folks at PGP Inc.
to join in.
More info on key-signing parties will be at
 by tommorrow.
