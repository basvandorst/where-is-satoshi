Of course that's a possibility.
I don't think the CIA is that corrupt.  I think the failure to consider
the three options I set out (and undoubtedly others I haven't) is a more
likely reason for finding believable intel than orders from above to
manufacture intel.  Didn't they even name a source or two for their
mobile weapons lab information?  While that's no guarantee the claimed
source(s) exist, it lends credibility to alternatives that don't require
such a vast conspiracy, alternatives that wouldn't create such a
political nightmare.
I prefer to believe that the CIA is incompetent rather than dishonest.
The fact that they're using Jennifer Garner to try to recruit people
seems to bolster my theory.
