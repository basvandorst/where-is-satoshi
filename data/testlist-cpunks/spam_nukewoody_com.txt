Long ago, I killfiled Mr CHoate.  Once in a while, though, my inbox is filled with dreck, of which Jim in the indirect origin.  Really guys, for
the amount of noise Jim adds to the list, there are several of you who seem
to amplify it nicely.  I can "slot filter" Mr Choate via killfile, but the
reverberation (which I can't filter) is becoming deafening.
