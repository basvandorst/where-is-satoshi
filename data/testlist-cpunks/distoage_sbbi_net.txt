it seem more compagny are going to put protection and drm in hardware,
to avoid bypassing or cracking it. I ask myself from times about such
systems bypassing with emulators use. The role of an emulator is to work
"as" a real cpu. What would be the usability of such an emulator with
cpu-drm enabled emulation ? The emulator work with real instructions of
drm-cpu, the os belive as a real one. But the emulation software can
give access of such drm datas to softwares running in the host os to
access or modify them. What people here that certainly have better
experiences than me in crypto think about such system ? Is it a possible
flow in new drm protected systems ?

(thanks for interesting answer)
I have read infos that say that audio and video drivers will be in the
trusted chain. If your hardware system is used by an os (i.e. win) on
which you can't create drivers, and only industry signed drivers can be
used you can't bypass this by hacking drivers ...
My though is the hardware drm can be reverse engineered ? If you use
cert on your DRM you must put cert and private keys on your DRM chip ...
So you have somewhere memory (rom or else) where you have this private
and cert datas. So with good tools you can read what are the bits in
this DRM. So you can make a "soft drm" that use all the instructions of
the reverse engineered hard drm, you but the reverse engineered private
key, certs on your soft drm. All this goes on a "emulated" drm part on
your os emulator. So booting the os believe that it is hard, because all
instructions are the same, certs is the same, and private key can be
used by your soft drm to en/crypt drm files ...??? We see that with time
almost all can be reverse engineered, can it be the same with hard drm
systems ??
(so seems happy futur, something you buy and use but don't own ?)

with time each, but not the general crypto "philosophy" ?
yes, with "you" I meen "you being an hardware maker"
not a backdoor, we forget to much that every system is only 1 and 0
through electricity and physical circuits. If you can make them you can
watch them (with time and monney i agree). Perhaps thinking that datas
(certs, instructions) can be "hidden" behind a physical thing is only a
dream ? I ask myself if not every cryptosystem where you must have
something "hidden" or "physically not accessible" in point of the
process is not sure ?

interesting talk about economic elements ...
I believe that in every human new work (new creation, or new hack), the
men who make the work do things to help others make the work faster and
easier. So with time, if a few people can hack some drm machine, it will
be more easier and more cheaper for others to make the same thing. And
in economic with time the price of goods goes down. So in the beginning
perhaps the drm system will be good because too expensive to hack for
main people. But with price falling and methods easier to do, more
poeple will do it. And begin to share hacked files to others. So the
parallel "black market" of illegal files will rise again. So with times
people macking the drm stuff must either change it, or make it more
complexe to rise the price again ... But it seems that the time to
dismount a system is quicker than the time to change or make a new
one ... except if you make a big structural change ...

it seems now intel say there is no DRM in there chips.
Earlier FUD ? marketing tactic ? desire to hide truth to public as
discussed before ?
