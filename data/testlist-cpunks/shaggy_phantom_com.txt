i've written a steganography program for the pc.
 its called hide-and-seek and a copy is at ftp.netcom.com as either hideseek.zip or possibly hdsk40.zip, in /pub/qwerty
eff suggested i tell you folks and have you look at it (source is included)
if you like it, they want a copy.
i'm not subscribed to the cypherpunks list
 so you'll have to mail me to talk to me.

i've written a major upgrade to hideseek, a steganography program i wrote for dos.
the guy who was keeping it on his ftp site for me (xenon at netcom) isn't answering my mail so i have no where to put the new version.
1) does anyone want to look at the program?
2) does anyone know of a good ftp site for the program?
3) thanx

ok, hideseek is now at io.com in /pub/user/dfloyd somewhere.
hideseek is a steganography program for dos. this is version 5.0 and is a serious upgrade from the previous version.
