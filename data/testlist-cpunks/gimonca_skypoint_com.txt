Human Rights Watch sent the following letter, protesting the arrest of a
university lecturer for communicating on the Internet, to the Indonesian
government today.
August 14, 1996
His Excellency M. Arifin Siregar
Ambassador to the United States
Embassy of Indonesia
2020 Mass. Avenue, NW
Washington, DC  20036
Your Excellency:
     I am writing on behalf of Human Rights Watch/Asia to protest the arrest of Drs. Prihadi Beny Waluyo, a lecturer at Duta Wacana Christian University. Drs. Waluyo was arrested at his home by soldiers of the district military command. He was reportedly accused of distributing e-mail messages and also of sending messages relating to the July 27 riots to a destination in Holland. His arrest came after an unidentified person gave an officer photocopies of e-mail messages that were traced to Drs. Waluyo. The person claimed the printouts came from a store in Kebumen, a district of Yogyakarta.
     Following his arrest, Drs. Waluyo was interrogated by the military about his connections with the Peoples Democratic Party (PRD), which the government has accused of masterminding the riots, but he denied any involvement with the PRD. He acknowledged that he had sent messages over the Internet. Following his questioning, he was reportedly ordered to go to his home and was told to report to the district military command on a regular basis. He is said to be under strict surveillance.
     Human Rights Watch opposes actions by the Indonesian government to restrict electronic communication. As stated in Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights:
     Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression: this
     right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to
     seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and
     regardless of frontiers.
We believe that such forums provide a truly unique opportunity for people from around the globe to share their views with an international audience. By allowing unrestricted communication, important issues can receive the benefit of serious discussion by the broadest cross-section of society. If the Internet is to achieve its potential to become a global information infrastructure, it is important, at the present moment, to agree to allow its unrestricted development.
     We urge that Drs. Waluyi and every other citizen be allowed to receive and transmit electronic mail without fear of harassment, intimidation, or Sidney Jones

Forwarded message:
They can do whatever the hell they want. Whether it makes any difference to the store's bottom line is another question. What some places will do is call the card number
down to the credit offices, who will run an authorization (*not a
charge) for one dollar on that card number, figuring that if the
Visa/MC system won't even authorize a dollar, they'd better not
take the check. Personally, I don't think the process helps much.
It's all a part of Corporate Cover-Your-Own-Ass Culture. "Yes, the
check bounced, but we followed the procedures in the employee
manual!" "We're committed to taking definite steps to fight shrinkage!"
People on the list could probably come up with much better ways to
authenticate a reputation. Until then, for personal checks, you can
call any bank in the U.S., ask for bookkeeping, and ask them if there
are funds in the bank to cover the check you're holding. Any bank
should give you a yes or no on this. Some banks, like the First Banks
here in Minnesota, will do this through their automated telephone
banking services, 24 hours.
Now, for the rest of you who are calling for the government, of all
people, to protect your privacy, please......take that personal check, picture ID and MasterCard, go down to the after-Christmas
sales, and buy a clue.

True, there are risks in generalising from the actions of one individual to the group as a whole.  Nevertheless, where Islam is concerned, there are so many individuals behaving badly that we are justified in thinking the whole religion a force for bad.
Doubtless, I shall be told that "true Islam" is "true tolerance", "true freedom", and even "true apple pie".  I may be told that the horrors of actually existing Islam - remember this phrase, or something like it? - are all somehow the fault of the West.  But the fact is that most Moslems venerate old men in beards, who think that anyone who disagrees with them about God should be put to death, that a woman with a clitoris is a kind of devil, and that Western classical music is evil.
By my standards, these people are disgusting.  My only dispute with Tim is in our manner of expressing our disgust.

A few months back, some winos took most of Minnesota off the net
for a couple days. Upset with being kicked out from under a bridge,
they started a fire that took out the main fiber cable from downtown to MRNet + the U of M. Backup? Due to a mistake at a CO,
the backup link was routed thru the same area, and was also burned.
Interesting scrambling as nameservers puked and died.

Far be it from me to add to this, but this is from FV's
own website:
[begin quote]
[2] Why don't you use encryption with First Virtual?
Encryption is almost always cumbersome and difficult.  And it always
adds an additional step, and something else to worry about.  After all,
even banks and armored cars are subject to robbery attempts, and
sometimes those attempts succeed.  Rather than use encryption, we
decided to design a system in which it wouldn't be necessary.
[end quote]
I, uh, think that speaks for itself.

This has been true for years. On 800 numbers, the receiver gets ANI, not
CID. Check newsgroups like alt.dcom.telecom, comp.dcom.telecom, etc.:
there's always somebody talking about CID and ANI.
In the back of my mind, I remember hearing about an anonymizer for
800-number calls. Maybe at WilTel. Check the search engine of your choice.
Personally, I like Caller ID, because it gives individuals a service
that formerly only governments and corporations could get.

"Of course, technology is working on solutions to itself, but
   mechanisms that would hide the name of a message's author, such as
   cryptography and anonymous remailers, are convoluted and incomplete."

I'd rate the whole article as neither good nor bad. It was on the front
page of the paper edition, so I was a little unhappy at an offhand remark
that might discourage people from using remailers. I'm planning on doing the letters-to-the-editor thing, emphasis on saying
good things about remailers.

Is this the St. Martin's Press "True Names" edition that was listed in amazon.com? At one time, it was going to be released August or Sept. of this
I have to mention that the owner of Dreamhaven Books here in Minneapolis
complained to me last year that he has a "truckload" of remaindered copies
of "Peace War". They still have a bunch--every time I've been in there, there's a hardbound "Peace War" on display with a price tag of $1.00.
Buying a copy of "True Names" right now is about as easy as buying an
original Dead Sea Scroll--but if anybody wants a cheap copy of "Peace War",
look up Dreamhaven in Minneapolis.
