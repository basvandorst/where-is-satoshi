Where did you get your info?  Near IR is around 1-1.5 microns, at these
wavelengths, the body radiates very little energy.  I think most of the
systems you are discussing use mid (3-5) or long-wave (8-12) IR, where
objects that are room to body temp radiate most of their energy.

Of course you can use pgp to sign binaries.  How else did the pgp binary
itself get signed?  You can either sign it in a separate file, or in the
same file.  PGP sorts it out for you.  What do you use it for?  Same reasons you sign text.  "I signed this file"
means that you vouch for it in some undefined way (maybe I wrote and
compiled it, or somesuch).  Clay Olbon II       *      Clay.Olbon at dynetics.com

First, a disclaimer:  I think adults should be allowed to ingest whatever
substances they desire, and parents should be allowed to raise their kids
without undue interference from the government.  Having said that, I think that the major issue with Ritalin is that parents
are giving it to their children in significant percentages of the
population.  Since Ritalin is "medicine" and is prescribed by doctors, it
is assumed to be safe.  However, I would bet that many parents whose
children are on daily doses of Ritalin would not think of drinking coffee
or alcohol while pregnant or nursing.  It is important to consider that any
drug used over a period of time may have lasting (possibly negative)
effects, and that these effects are multiplied when the drugs are taken by
still-developing children.  While it is crucial for an adult to be able to function and maintain a job,
is it really as important for a kid to be able to sit still in school?  Clay Olbon II       *      Clay.Olbon at dynetics.com

If you read this weeks "Network Computing", there is a report on Symantec's
Your Eyes Only encryption software for Windoze 95.  The article can be
found at:   Looks
like a PGP competitor - uses RSA public key, DES, triple-DES, RC4, RC4 or
blowfish secret key algorithms.  It can also be used to encrypt directories
on the hard-drive while retaining the ability to use them.
This appears aimed at corporate users, and includes a "super-user" access
to all encrypted files/messages.  Also includes the capability to create an
"unlock" disk that will decrypt everything should you lose your password.
Now my $.02.  I am concerned about the lack of a distinction between
transient communications and stored data.  This is apparent in the GAK
proposals, but is also increasingly apparent in mainstream corporate
products such as this one and ViaCrypt BE.  It is apparent (to me anyway)
that corporate access to stored data (data owned by the company, on
machines owned by the company) is probably necessary.  I do not see this
same need for access to transient communications.  Am I way off base on
this one?

justify massive increases in government power over the private sector; this
of course, has never stopped them before.  The desire to "do something"
appears to infect every politician, fortunately our system has checks and

Most people I have encountered don't use PGP because of the initial
learning curve, more than the overall ease of use.  I work in a small
office that is separate from corporate HQ.  I have been trying for over a
year to convince people to use PGP for intra-office communication.  What I
have found is that for people within the office, it is fairly easy -
hands-on instruction works well.  Convincing folks at HQ has been a royal
pain however.  Most of the problem appears to be the "you mean I have to
learn new software?" variety.  Once I have coached someone over the
"knowledge hump" (often by phone), they tell me that using pgp is pretty
easy.   We use Eudora Light for the Mac, YMMV . The trick is convincing the user that the benefits associated with using
pgp are greater than the initial pain.  This is something I have only
accomplished with a few people.  This educational process will continue to be the stumbling block for
widespread use until there is truly seamless encryption.  My fear is that
seamless encryption will be weak; witness the widespread use of 40bit
Netscape and the supposedly 40bit default behavior for S/MIME.  I think
that export controls are a driver towards weak defaults.
OK, that last part was a WA tangent from my "ease of using pgp" thread. It's late and I'm hungry.  Sue me.

I apologize in advance for this overly long post, but Stephan had a number
of arguments that I disagree with quite strongly.  In general, I think
micropayments are a good idea that should be tested where it counts, in the
How is this an argument against micropayments?  Lets just throw up our
hands and say that all crypto is theoretically breakable, therefore we
won't encrypt anything.
Why is this malarkey?  What is wrong with saying "If you want to see my
page, it will cost you $.02?  Why would a "front door" make it any safer
for consumers?  I set my browser so that I spend no more than $1/hour or
$.02 on any one page without asking me.  How difficult is this concept?
Of course, there is lots of software that I only use once in a while, yet
spend large $$ on to have sitting on my machine metaphorically gathering
dust.  Micropayments would be very useful for this software.  On the other
hand, there is some software that I may want to buy outright.  This is not
an exclusive system.  BTW, any impression that you have that you are
currently buying unmetered software is false.  Don't you spend xx$/year to
run Photoshop in the form of "product upgrades" - or are you still running
version 1.0?
I tend to disagree with most arguments for "consumer protection", so this
argument falls upon deaf ears.  There are lots of scams with every form of
money (cash, credit, even barter - if I trade you a lawnmower that only
runs for an hour afterwards, I have scammed you), how does this make
micropayments any more undesirable than any other form of payment?
Name some software that you have used less than 10 times in the past year. If you use a computer much, you might be surprised to find that you have a
long list.  I know I do.
What is to say that micropayments won't authorize an extended license for
software you have on YOUR machine - i.e. I download some software, to use
it for a day I pay $1 and get a 1-day license.  The software is local.  Of
course, this doesn't preclude you from paying $1 to run it on a
supercomputer that you wouldn't normally have access to ...
Wrong.  Why would you be shafted?  Do you think vendors would be willing to throw
away your business?  Look at your previous example of the ISPs, some
individuals pay a metered rate, others a flat rate - why would software use
be any different?
Of course, now you can get credit cards thay pay you between 1% and 3% per
transaction ...
Why should people think about this?  Let the market decide - if people try
it and fail, it will go away.  If it suceeds, then it is obviously useful
to some consumers.
Well, the market works.  Sorry you don't believe in reality.
Those poor consumers, what would they do without you looking out for them? I personally could care less if someone gets scammed - let the buyer
beware.  If the fees are too large, NO ONE WILL BUY THEM!  Basic economics.
Do you really think people don't know the difference between $.02/minute
and $.02/nanosecond?  Do you think software cannot easily distinguish the
difference?  Let's argue from a basis in reality here!

There are a couple of main reasons that the poor spend more than their

elderly are spending down their retirement savings.  Another factor, of
course, is that welfare, food stamps, free/subsidized housing and other
transfer payments are not included in income calculations.  I have seen
reports that show that in many states, this is equivalent to a full-time
job paying ~$9/hr.  Not showing these as income helps keep the "official"

legislation for whatever reason brands you as "anti-family" or "soft on

before congress and the media as justification for stricter control over
this material.  Congressmen, not wanting to face attack ads claiming that
they support pornography (or terrorism, or whatever), will pass silly laws

The first solution is improbable and the second is risky.  Only the third
solution actually provides a method where we can really have an impact.  I
think PICS is a great idea, and I think it may have an impact on judicial

that it is a good-enough solution to avoid further control over the

I think there is a great deal of misunderstanding here.  I can speak for no
one other than myself, but I don't "hate the poor", nor do I feel no
compassion towards misfortunate people.  However, I have to be realistic -
I approach problems analytically, not emotionally.  My emotions tell me
that spending more money is a good thing.  My reason tells me that we have
"been there, done that" and it DOESN'T WORK.  After spending more than a
trillion $$ on the "War on Poverty" we are worse off than we were before.
Can anyone point to ANY evidence that this money was well spent?  If not,
then why should we spend more?  It is time to look for new solutions.
Why wouldn't your income change when you move?  In my area, you can make
over $6/hour working at McDonalds ($12K/year).  I know several people who
work two jobs.  I know of families (almost all immigrants BTW) that work
their tails off running small businesses.  It isn't about education, it is
about hard work.  Of course hard-work can help to get a good education.
also Doug Hughes:
So how do we go about makeing education better?  More money doesn't work,
having a net connection probably won't help, even having more computers
doesn't make a substantial difference.  It all comes down to the fact that
people need to be responsible for their own actions.  Nowadays, you can
grow up illiterate, and expect to get food stamps, free housing, welfare,
etc, the cash equivalent of which approaches $20K/year in many places.  Or
you can become a capitalist and make big $$ selling "illegal substances".
These "consequences" are the result of people with good intentions,
thinking with their emotions instead of their minds.  Maybe it is time to

In medical research (this particular application - there are others I am
sure) it is desirable to have a large database of individual medical
histories available to search for correlations, risk factors, etc.  The
problem, of course, is that many individuals want their medical histories
kept private.  It is therefore necessary to maintain a database that is not
traceable back to individuals.  An additional requirement is that people
must be able to add additional information to their records as it becomes
available.  The researcher who initially posed the question suggested
adding random data to "encrypt anonymity".
My first cut solution was to hash the individual's name (perhaps including
some other info or random info to thwart dictionary attacks) and send the
records in under the hashed name.  If done correctly, this should protect
the anonymity of the record.  The problem with this is that with the volume
of data available in a medical record, it is very probable that a person
could be tied to that record.
Does anyone have any insights into this problem?   This is of
purely academic interest to me, I don't know the person who asked the
intial question (other than through email).  It just sounds like a neat
problem.         Clay

@_subject: Pyramid schemes and cryptoanarchy 
It seems that pyramid scheme spamming has increased of late (if that is
possible!).  In my lifetime, I can only remember a single snail-mail
instance of a pyramid scheme - over the net it is an entirely different
story (although the number of instances is probably proportional to the
number of lists I subsribe to).  With fully anonymous digital cash will come
the ability to develop untraceable pyramid schemes.  As a staunch believer
in the free market, I find laws against these schemes distasteful, quite
hypocrytical (i.e. Social Security), and soon to be unenforceable.
Pyramid schemes could be a growth market in a crypto-anarchic world.  It is
yet another market such as gambling, or the lottery, that could be conducted
with anonymity.  And it appears to be much more widespread on the internet
currently, even without anonymity.  And unlike gambling or the lottery, the
payoffs could increase greatly should anonymity be available.  Now, what is the point of this discussion of pyramid schemes?  It is to
bring to light yet another area that will be untouchable by governments.
And I think that it will help continue the development and proliferation of
some of our pet projects, specifically fully anonymous digital cash and
remailers.  Remailer operators could even fund their operations through
pyramid schemes (directly, or indirectly through digital postage stamps).  I
am not, however, advocating spam. I simply see it as a natural extension of
current practice, that may actually provide tangible benefits in the near
future.  Clay Olbon			clay.olbon at dynetics.com

I was not saying that chain letters are like gambling.  My point was that
they could be conducted with anonymity - like gambling and the lottery.
Your other point is well made.  Anyone have ideas on a protocol to prevent
this problem?
Agreed.  Although I think gambling and the lottery are pretty stupid as well
("The lottery is a tax on people who are bad a math" - from a friend's .sig).
I'm not familiar with the airplane game.  Sounds like a DNC fundraiser to me
;-) And yes, I think there are a lot of stupid people out there (ex. I
started a new job recently and noticed that a warning about the "Good Times
Virus" was posted on the bulletin board).  I'm not sure that the game would
even have to be close to fair for plenty of people to participate -
especially if it involves digital cash and email, which may be much easier
than snail-mailing letters.         Clay

Yes, but I believe 3DES has an effective key length of only 112 bits.  Of
course, even this is more than sufficient for a long time to come.         Clay

You can add me to your list.  I keep an "unemployability list" - although I
don't write it down or put it on a computer.  Why don't you come back to reality.  I have hired and fired people.  Those
that I fired I would not hire again.  There are others I have worked with
that I would never hire (and would strongly recommend against anyone else
hiring).  That is life.  I have little sympathy for the "unfortunate" people
that I may hurt by not recommending their employment.  Generally it is
because they are lazy, stupid, or dishonest.  This is a judgement call on my
part, and others are free to take or discard my recommendations based on my
reputation.  Here is my recommendation for you.  Take my "unemployables" list.  Hire
everyone on it.  Try to run a business without going broke.
Hiring people based on reputation is a system that works.  I'm sorry if this
impinges on your sensibilities.  Reality has a tendency to do that though.          Clay

I won't comment on who I will or won't hire.  I will state that I believe
that what a person posts is a relevant issue when it comes time to make a
hiring decision.  Hiring is based on many factors other than simply
technical ability. If someone thinks that another should not be hired for
whatever reason, I support their right to hold that belief and even to
publicize it.  I won't follow you into the gutter on this one.  That horse has been dead
for days (and it is beginning to smell really bad).

@_subject: Mass-market crypto phones 
A while back, Eric Blossom posted a URL for a mass-market, phone encyrption
device (  The point of this post is to posit a
scenario based on the implications of this product.  This is speculation
based on where I think such products should be heading.
I think we need to keep a couple of goals in mind.  The first, is to get
encrypting phones (or phone add-ons) into Wal-mart, K-mart, etc (where
probably most Americans now buy their phones).  The prices need to be low
enough that people will want to buy them (<$100?).  Is this technically
feasible?  The comsec device from the above URL already demonstrates the
needed capability.  Is the cost target possible?  My guess is soon, given
the lowering costs and increasing capabilities of current processors.
The second goal needs to be to push a similar product for cell-phones.  I
think this will be perhaps an easier sell, given the higher initial cost for
these phones, and their reduced security.  Perhaps a home device could be
sold with the cell-phone as a package deal, so that communications with the
"home base" (i.e your office, home, etc) would be secure.  With the rapid
growth in cell-phone sales, selling a package such as this might ensure a
larger user-base of home devices.
Given that these goals are met, I think widespread use of crypto over phone
lines would become almost inevitable.  However, the fun part would be the
introduction of such products.  The FUD coming from police, the government,
etc. would be amazing to behold.
