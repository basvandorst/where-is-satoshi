I agree.  Altho we'd probably want to build our own boards, we'd have to
rely on commercially availiable integrated circuits and other
components.  The components we'd need are fairly easy to obtain, and I
don't see any reason to believe that we will have difficulty obtaining
computer components to build a secret network in the future.  Oceania
will probably become a major source of electronic privacy technologies,
but that's still several years in the future.

Yes.  Who can host the mailing list?
