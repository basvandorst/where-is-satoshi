A preprint was circulating at the RSA conference; Adi Shamir had a copy. Similar techniques were used by Vincent Rijmen
and Elizabeth Oswald, in their paper available at

I haven't read the original paper, and I have a great deal of
respect for Markus Jakobsson. However, techniques that establish
that the parties share a weak secret without leaking that secret
have been around for years -- Bellovin and Merritt's DH-EKE,
David Jablon's SPEKE. And they don't require either party to
send the password itself at the end.

I forget the beginning of this conversation... but if you're
salting all public-key encryption operations you may as well
just use a standard RSA encryption scheme, such as OAEP or
RSA-KEM. OAEP is specified in PKCS available from  it's well-
studied and has a proof of security, and should certainly be
used in preference to any home-grown system.
If you were talking about salting something other than public
key operations, accept my apologies...

A similar approach enabled Bleichenbacher's SSL attack on RSA with PKCS padding. This sounds very dangerous to me.
