@_subject: Encrypting same data with many keys... 
PGP uses and E of 17 by default, but it would be a problem except that
there is a specification for random padding, so it *NEVER* encrypts
identical plaintext.  It always uses a number just a few bits shorter than N, starting with 0x02, then nonzero random bytes, then a zero byte, and
finally the message bytes you want to encrypt.
There was a man-in-the-middle or replay attack with SSL that they changed
the spec of the padding slightly (8 bytes before the zero byte must be
0x03), I think this is because you might be able to quickly find a random
cyphertext that decrypts to having a zero byte followed by something
useful as key material, but haven't read the details. --- reply to tzeruch - at - ceddec - dot - com ---
