@_subject: BoS: Got to be kidding right? 
People, I don't particularily agree with this posting, and I already emailed
the original poster with my thoughts on that subject.  Now, before you reply
to this post, please read the charter. BoS is supposed to be the *BEST* of
security, not the *LONG-DRAWN-OUT-DISCUSSION-OF-SECURITY-ISSUES*.  I
understood that I when I subscribe and I have tried to limit any posting
to strictly security issues, and only those important and not ones starting
threads of conversation.  Read the charter!  (Who's in charge of this
group anyways??  Hope I'm not stepping on toes!)

  "To be a saint is to be an exception; to be a true man is the rule.
   Err, fail, sin if you must, but be upright.  To sin as little as
   possible is the law for men; to sin not at all is a dream for angels."
