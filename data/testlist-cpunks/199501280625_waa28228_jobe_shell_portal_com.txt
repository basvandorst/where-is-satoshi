@_subject: Even more unix holy wars. 
Did I mention that UNIX used to make you use ED out of the box?
Of course it isn't.  Train somebody under BSD (say using csh/tcsh/zsh)
and they are totally prepared to get to work under ksh/bash/sh under
SVR4.  The commands are the same and so are the options, on say things
like ps.  NOT.
Unix commands are powerful and easy to use.  For example, to kill a
process I have to use "ps -aux" or "ps -ef" depending on which flavor
of unix I'm running, note the process id, and do a "kill -9 id".  Why
can't I kill a job by name (i.e. I can do a "fg %emacs" but not a
"kill %emacs".)  Unix is filled with design abortions like this.
How about better Windows software is available?
