And what's so bad about doing this:
for (i=0; i < n-1; i++) {
  swap_positions(array, i, i+rand(n-i));
which populates the array by randomly choosing the next element?
It all comes down to knowing how good "rand()" is, anyway...

I almost never participate in this group, but here it's hard to resist.
It's no longer gambling if the insurances get to see through the back of
the cards. I think this is what the objection is about.
