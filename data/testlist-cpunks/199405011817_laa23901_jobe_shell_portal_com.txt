@_subject: Another remailer 
Actually, it's been changed to anon at jpunix.com.  It's running the same
software as Patrick Oonk's, so the headers come out messed up and you
can't chain remailers... :(  Maybe if we ask him nicely, he'll put it
back.  He did revoke the public key, I have no idea why the hell he did
