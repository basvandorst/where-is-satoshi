I think that government-funding does give a certain degree of control --
the control that comes with the budget axe.  Private citizens
alternatively, get to face a different type of tool. They get to face stuff like RICO provisions, which "effectively" -- as
they are presently used, rather than as they were written and intended to
be used -- tend to allow the government to "influence" private citizens. I doubt that the NSA approves the NCSA's budget.
Far more likely would be for the NSA to use a rogue programmer at the
NCSA.  Someone who might hide some very damaging code into one of the
existing applications without anyone (else) knowing about it. I could even see an independent doing this simply to profit from it.  I
could see someone doing something like that.  It's no different really
than the "free" programs that were given away years ago which appeared to
be useful but actually contained "poison code". Like I said, I don't believe in the "grand conspiracy" model.  I tend
toward "contained" enterprises. All the more reason though, NEVER to use black-box code, and all the more reason for public open review of code.  NSA and ITAR aside ... safe computing is safe computing and is in everyone's collective interest.
