Hi, Carl here from An Alien's Guide to Internet Sex
You should not be receiving this email unless you are an adult Webmaster and have submitted a link to Alien's.  This is my personal mailing list and was not  purchased or acquired by any other means.
I would like to announce the opening of my newest website,  Sex Story Post:    After only 1 week, Sex Story Post is getting over 6,000 Unique visitors a day.
This site is run just like the pic post sites but uses stories instead of pictures.  Studies have shown that visitors looking for stories are more likely to produce sign-
ups.  Why? Who the hell knows, maybe it is because they can read well enough to sign up for a credit card.  What does this do for you?  Aren't we all looking for quality traffic?  Also, there are several sponsors out there that will allow you to post their banner to pic post and STORY POST sites as well.
So come, add your story and your banner, and get your share of these great revenue producing surfers.  You can go straight to the submit page at:  PS.  while you are there add your link to the links page.
My Newest site:  Also come add your link to my other pages:
