@_subject: a protocol 
have "Applied Cryptography".  However, it seems that Jim's protocol
depends on the Interlock Protocol guaranteeing that Alice really
gets Bob's public key and vice versa.  Otherwise, it seems that
Mallet could give each of Alice and Bob his (or is that a feminine
name?) public key, go through Jim's protocol with each party, then
just translate every message from cipher-text to clear-text then
back to cipher-text using the key for the other half of the conversation.
