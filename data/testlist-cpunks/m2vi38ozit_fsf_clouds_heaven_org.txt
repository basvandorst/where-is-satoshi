Circ uses 3DES for encryption and does key exchange with RSA. It runs on top of irc, and encrypts/decrypts by running a program
in the backgound. There is also a standalone client.
I'm not sure that authentication is wanted or needed for irc. There have been a lot of problems with people grabbing a list of everyone on irc at a given time, then e-mailing them spam or vague threats. ircd 2.9.2 implements the +a mode for channels
which somehow disallows listing user information even if you are
on the channel with them.
