Some gun "accidents" are suicides reported as such to avoid
embarrassment to the family.  Similarly, I think a few of the gun
"accidents" involving real "children", which are extremely rare to begin
with, go like this...
"Son, why don't you take this gun and pretend to go shoot daddy?  It's
not loaded." Or, "Son, why don't you take the gun, put it to your head,
and pull the trigger?  It's not loaded."
I don't believe the article when it says that smart guns are useless if
stolen.  What do they have, a tamper-proof memory chip storing a 128-bit
reprogramming authorization key that must be input via computer before
allowing a new person to be authorized?  And what's to stop a criminal
from ripping out all the circuitry and the safety it engages?
"War is the father and king of all, and some he shows as gods, others as men;
some he makes slaves, others free." -Heraclitus 53
