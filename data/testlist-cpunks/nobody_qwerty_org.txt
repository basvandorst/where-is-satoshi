New remailer: qwerty at netcom.com.
No logs. Only a "counter" that works by appending the word "R" or "ER" to a
text file so I can get an idea if anyone is using it. However, I'm sure the
Netcom and other site's mail logs will be enough to track serious abusers
of anonymity down, without my help. This remailer is dedicated to honest
people who desire PRIVACY.
(The extra "-" and "space" characters at the beginning of some lines are an
artifact of my signing this with PGP).
Accepts standard,
Request-Remailing-To: address
or standard,
(blank line)

This may not be elegant, but it works well in my account. It checks
the entire Cypherpunk remailer network connections and is user friendly.

If it wasn't obvious, SuperPing is the sort of utility that only needs to
be run say once a day by ONE person out there. Since I did it today, and
I haven't reported any down links, you can be rest assured the network
is fully connected, at least the remailers listed in the code.

I'm not too familiar with extropia these days. Does it have a direct
internet connection? What is its characteristics? I'm trying to make
up a more useful list of remailers, with details, since different
users do have different needs for remailers. Thanks.

No, fortunately for other users, I do not have root access on Netcom ;-).

I'm using Hal's remailer, so ask him the details of what I have running.
How many of those private sites with remailers having root, keep NO personal
logs? Any? I would like to compile a more detailed listing of the details
about each remailer's capabilities, situation, and policy statements.
If someone sends anonymous mail through my mailer victimizing someone in
a criminal manner, and law enforcement convinces Netcom to check the logs,
then more power to them. If someone sends mail discussing large doses of
vitamin C, when vitamin supplementys are banned a year from now, and the
FDA wants to arrest them, and Netcom allows them to see the mqueue then
that would be unfortunate indeed. I am running a remailer. Here is the
situation. What more can I offer? I would ask people to look at the
various remailers and ask in a street smart practical manner what the
pros and cons of each one is.
What, exactly, does the mqueue record? How long does it get saved? I
needed remailers to maintain some simple privacy by distancing myself
from the character Xenon. No 5AM fone calls and letters from people
asking me to send them PGP.... I figured if I was going to become the
largest volume user of the remailers, I should become a remailer
myself. The other option was to use the Netcom account to directly
mail out what I am sending to people, but that wasn't as fun of an

werner asked,
"Can a remailer be used to post to an arbitrary Usenet group?"
newsgroup at news.cs.indiana.edu posts things quickly via e-mail. When I
use anon.penet.fi for Usenet, I often use this, since it is quite a bit
faster than using anon.penet.fi's posting feature.
"Is the above a stupid question?"
Is this a stupid answer? Both are in various FAQs.

Mike Markley say,
"I'd be curious to see how they are going to do voice recognition on
random conversations. Unless I am very sadly out of date you need to
teach the pattern matcher individual voices."
But of course they will just collect voice samples from everyone soon,
and use them to IDENTIFY you. It'll probably be put on our US national
health care cards. Ever since I started worrying about leaving DNA on
postage stamps, I've started to think what can be done will be done.

How LONG should the such a random delay BE, at max? I am not willing to add

PGP Slave,
Could you please announce my full name, phone number, address, visa card
number, a giff of my signature, height, weight and driver's licence number
not only to the Cypherpunks mailing list but to many usenet groups as well,
since you obviously feel I no longer wish to be known to the masses as
Xenon, and I instead want them to start calling me and postal mailing me
asking for copies of PGP. Thanks asshole. I thought the people on this
list were concerned with privacy, but I was wrong. I mention Xenon in
my personal .plan, but I ask people to let me keep the small amount of
extra privacy I still retain.
You wrote,
"qwerty account or not, the public logs on netcom show more than enough
info to trivially track people down."
Trivial? And so you hack out the info that a message went from remailer
A through qwerty and on to remailer B, at a certain time. You haven't
tracked down anyone my friend.
