Excerpts from internet.cypherpunks: 24-Jul-96 Re: When books are
outlawed by Alan Olsen at teleport.com Susie Bright is wonderful. She sent a copy of her latest book, which I
have right here: "Nothing but the Girl: The Blatant Lesbian Image."
It's the one I gave Bruce Taylor when he stopped by a few weeks ago.
