@_subject: Banned Research and Raids on "Secret Labs" 
are used to harass and slow down researchers and other politically incorrect persons. The language is telling: "send a message," "signal our unhappiness,
" "order a timeout," "a shot across the bow," etc.  These raids and subpoenas and "visits" are designed to intimidate in an extra-constitutional way. The Founders would see this as another case of the King's Men throwing their weight around.
An eqally chilling response would be for a few terminally ill anarchists to wire up their home with explosives, announce they too intend to conduct human cloning experiments and wait for the no-know at the door.
