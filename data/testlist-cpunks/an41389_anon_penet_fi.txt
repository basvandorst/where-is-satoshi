@_subject: How to disable telnet to port 25 
Hey fellow punks:
by telneting into port 25 in a site. Many people discussed the pro's and con's,
but I wanted to know if anybody knows of a way to stop people from getting in
there to send the message in the first place.

Tis I, Wintermute, aka The Al Capone of the Info Highway.
I checked through this info, and I seem to be safe and sound. It's
interesting that your system does this.
Thanks for letting me have a chance to protect myself....
