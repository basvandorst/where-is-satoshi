Thanks for posting this URL Peter.  Of particular note is the heading:
An anonymous opinion from inside the Defence Dept holds that electronic
bits on a wire do not constitute goods, and as a result if you ship
electronically, you are not subject to the regulations.  If you ship a
CD or floppy or other physical media containing software, you violate the
I'll add this to the SSLeay legality FAQ - standard disclaimers apply
of course, obtain professional legal advice before exporting SSLeay.

@_subject: Randomness testing 
We have been asked by a customer if we have any tests that demonstrate the randomness of the SSLeay random number generator (augmented by some
sound-card random number seeding that we wrote).
I'd like to find some standard implementation for testing randomness, but Schneier offers no help (other than a reference to Knuth Vol 2), and I
don't know where else to turn.
I realise that cryptographic randomness requires unpredictability, and
this quality depends upon closed-world assumptions about unknown individuals'
predictive powers, but we have to live with that.
