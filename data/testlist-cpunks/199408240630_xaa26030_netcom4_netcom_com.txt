I think that's because Knuth is rather famous.  I imagine that his mailbox stays rather full ;)
I don't quite see it that way - it's just easier for me to automatically sign my messages than not if I choose to set my mailer up that way.  If I want to encrypt, it's just a couple of keystrokes in elm to change my editor to the appropriate script.
I guess I really don't understand your objections, Tim.  True, not every UA is as easy as elm to change operating parameters, but it works for me.
PGP is easy and not-too-slow to use, and it integrates fairly well into scripts. I've been using these little scripts for months and while they're not quite as flexible as I'd like, they do the job - easily, transparently, and automatically.
