"Partnerships" for $100...
"What are the residual fX of ALL non prescription (that means recreational and damned fun if you went to
Woodstock or Monterey for the left coast..) drugs?"
correct! "Central Intelligence Agency for $400!"
Is there any way to get 2-bit site certicates to all these
darn websites? I wanna see my damn lock closed, even when
I browse my own damned site! hehe

Well... a Leo Szilard web site ( How do you say it? Say sil'-ahrd.)
has an article where he is interviewed titled
_Leo Szilard, Interview: President Truman Did Not Understand_
"After all, Japan was suing for peace."
"Today I would say that the confusion arose from considering the fake alternatives of either having to invade Japan or of having to use the
bomb against her cities."
I admit I only followed a link from Home Page of J. Orlin Grabbe _Target Committee Meeting, Los Alamos, May 10-11, 1945_
to get to that particular story. Of more particular interest to myself is the shipment of 65% uranium
sent from the Belgian Congo, in 1939-40. 1250 tons were sent to Staten Island, NY, by Edward Sengier of Union Miniere, to prevent the
Axis powers from obtaining it. p 852.
It is a _good_ book. I enjoyed it.
