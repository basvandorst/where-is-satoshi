About this Conference:
As government becomes more dependent on e-business, databases, information storehouses, mission critical information storage and information sharing, new risks are posed. These risks may come from student hackers, foreign governments or foreign military, terrorist organizations or even internal users.
With the new e-Government applications and communications, computer security has emerged as a top issue and challenge. This conference will highlight the risks, opportunities and innovative management and technical approaches to the detection and response to unauthorized intrusions into agency data.
