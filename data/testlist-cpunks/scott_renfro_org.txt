Actually, the tubes were from decommissioned M110A2 8-inch howitzers
(203mm) cut down to 19 feet in length (just in case anyone's estimating
yield at home, the 8-inch tube gives about 70% more volume than 155mm --
about a cubic yard).

Actually, adding this line in /etc/make.conf is preferable.
Assuming the system and crypto source is installed in /usr/src (which it
must be to do a buildworld/installworld), the following works and is
*much* faster:
  cp /usr/src/crypto/openssl/crypto/idea/idea.h /usr/include/idea.h
  cd /usr/src/secure/lib/libcrypto
  make
  make install
  make clean
Then mix-2.9b23.tar.gz builds just fine after toggling the  from 0
to 1 at Src/crypto.h:33.

The following seems to work on OpenBSD-2.8; 2.9 shouldn't be terribly
  cd /usr/src/lib/libssl/src/crypto/objects
  perl obj_dat.pl objects.h obj_dat.h
  cd /usr/src/lib/libssl/crypto
  patch < ~/libcrypto-makefile.diff
  make
  make install
  cd
  tar -zxvf mix-2.9b23.tar.gz
  patch < ~/mix-openssl-2.8.diff
  cd Mix-2.9beta23
  ./Install
The patch files are included below.
