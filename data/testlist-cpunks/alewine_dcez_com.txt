But this isn't MS's RegWiz. It's capabilities sound much greater, and it's not clear how to opt out, etc. from the press release:
<< Oil
Change reportedly tracks all currently installed versions and revisions
of all
Windows 95 software and hardware drivers on a PC, and then dials into
CyberMedia's Internet Web Server for related updates.>>
is this thing scary? I don't know. Does software like it have potential for abuse? Absolutely. Fear mongering? I don't think so. Just a Heads up.

Maybe i'm confused, but oil change sounds like a mole that can burrow unbidden into user's disks. I don't think user installation is required, or else it will auto install the user code on installation of whatever software has licensed it.
