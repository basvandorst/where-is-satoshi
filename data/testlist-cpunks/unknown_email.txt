The problem is that Phrack has a distribution that goes in other directions,
where a simple Usenet newsgroup can not reach.  I've seen files from past
Phrack issues available on Public Domain archive sets for BBS's.  Phrack has
been around for quite a while now and unlike a lot of the other series
on-line mags, it is probably going to be around for a while longer.  CuD and
the likes are great for news, but where else can you find somewhat lengthy
papers on various topics?  Even if most of it is elementary, there is always
something interesting in each issue, even if it is just to see some of the
personalities that are out there.
Like it or not, piece of crap or otherwise, it does get around.  It's going
through ownership changes and probably would like to find some people that
would be willing to help out with "cleaning" it up.  Why not help?

Well, I'm the person posting all the number theory stuff anonymously.
Well, not too anonymously since I am signing each post... ;)
I thought I'd try out Matt Ghio's service.  I'm not sure exactly what
will happen, but hopefully you will able to reply to this message and

Anyway, I got my copy of "Elementary Number Theory and its
Applications" by Kenneth Rosen just now, and checked Miller-Rabin
primality testing, and pseudoprime primality testing.  Eric pointed
out some recent work (by Pomerance I presume) and it does indeed junk
the notion that for pseudoprime testing, the failure rate is 2^-n, n
being the number of trials.
However, Miller-Rabin isn't susceptible (it uses strong pseudoprime
testing) - and what it even better is the latest bound is 4^-k!  That
is, if you pick k integers and perform M-R on n for each, the chance a
composite will pass is less than (1/4)^k.
And, there is no analogy of a Carmichael number for strong
So I guess the bottom line is M-R is the way to go.

@_subject: I support HR 3627 
February 9, 1994
Dear Rep. Cantwell,
I support HR 3627, because I strongly believe in every American's right to privacy. In our burgeoning global markets, American businesses must rely on secure communications to prevent industrial espionage. If the Clinton Administration succeeds in dictating that only the "Clipper Chip" can be exported, it will effectively strangle any other means of secure communications. In a competitive global market for technology and communications, I think it is crucial that American businesses retain the right to produce the products and security solutions that their customers want, free of the restrictions and demands of government controls and Rep. Cantwell, this is not an arcane technical issue of export control. The freedom of Americans to be secure in their communications from unwarranted government intrusion is essential to our liberty. I think this is one of the few issues that both Republicans and Democrats agree upon, so I hope you will be able to generate bi-partisan support for your bill. Sincerely, M. Scott Braden

be placed on smart cards (in order to prevent double spending, or even to
prevent people from cheating on taxes...).
To be honest that's about all I know about observers and I am very eager
to find out more.  I am, however, having a hard time finding interesting
references on this subject.
Hence, all suggestions to get me started would be extremely welcome.
Questions of particular interest are: possible functions (and limits),
how 'real' are they already?, what about privacy?, ...

Nice april fools article...  After all, position information is nothing more than a particular
phase shift (time delay) between GPS data streams received
from the set of satellites overhead.  If I report the datastreams
received -- or information about them -- then someone can
calculate where I am.  (Indeed, there are GPS applications
where the device whose position is of interest doesn't actually
decode the GPS data, it merely reports what it receives to some
central data collection site, where the arithmetic is done.)
If I want to pretend to be somewhere else, all I have to do is
some simple geometry to calculate the time delays I want to
report, and then phase-shift the GPS streams from their
received position to where they would be at the other place.
Note that relying on the PP code (military code) in the GPS
stream is no help, since I don't need to be able to interpret
the PP stream in order to pretend to be elsewhere, I merely
need to know where I am and where I want to be, to insert
the right phase shift.

@_subject: questions about bits and bytes 
Not so.
It appears that the term "byte" originated in the IBM 360, where
it is indeed 8 bits.  And certainly all present day computers use
"byte" to refer to an octet and not to any other size.  That has not
always been true.
The CDC 6000 series used 6-bit characters, though those weren't
usually referred to as "byte".  On the other hand, on the PDP10
there were "byte instructions" which would operate on an arbitrary
piece of the (36-bit) word.  On that machine, "bytes" when used to
store characters were often 9 bits long.  That's where things like
"meta" and "alt" started, see the Hacker's Dictionary.

@_subject: No matter where you go, there they are. 
No, the situation is better than that.
Here's how GPS works (loosely): you have four unknowns (not three):
x, y, z, and the current time.  You have signals from four satellites
reporting their x, y, z, t.  Using suitable math you construct four equations
in four unknowns, and presto, you get your four answers.
Why is time one of the unknowns?  Because your receiver only has
a rough idea of what time it is.  Remember that a microsecond offset
amounts to a 300 meter (1000 foot) displacement.  So a side effect of
GPS position measurement is accurate time measurement.  (Some
GPS receivers turn this around, and make delivering accurate time
their primary task.  They get accurate position as a side effect.)
Suppose I want to pretend that I am 1000 feet closer to satellite 4 than I really am.  Simple, I take the signals from all the other satellites
and delay them by 1 microsecond.  That looks like a 1 microsecond
local timebase error together with a 1 microsecond delay reduction
to satellite 4.
Yes, the checking station in this purported scheme would also listen
to the satellites.  That doesn't help at all.  It could detect that I replayed
a signal from a minute ago (unless I substitute the correct time codes,
which wouldn't be hard since they are predictable).  But there is no
need to do that and indeed it's probably easier not to.    In the description
of the article, the "signature" [sic] is sent to the checker over some
sort of comm link, which has a latency likely to be several milliseconds
or more, plus jitter of many microseconds.  If I'm a healthy distance
away from the target (say, 20 miles) that means I have to introduce an
offset of at most 100 microseconds.  If I do that in real time -- which is
no big deal -- then the checker basically has to be capable of
detecting 100 microsecond delays in the authentication data it is
getting.  And if I'm willing to be closer to the lion's den -- say, a block
or two away -- then I only need at most a one microsecond delay.
Incidentally, differential GPS is not an issue (re Peter's question).
GPS relies on knowing accurately the position and time at each satellite and the speed of light in between.  DGPS lets you correct
for errors in these.  The idea is simple: if you're close to a "reference
station", then the errors are essentially the same for both.  The
reference station is at a precisely known place, so it can look at where
the satellites claim it is, and deduce from that how much error there is
on the signal from each satellite.  It tells you, and you subtract out those
errors.  So while DGPS lets you get better accuracy, it doesn't
interfere with your ability to fool the CyberLocator scheme.

@_subject: No matter where you go, there they are. 
Yes, that was my initial reaction too, but the content just don't support that.
I suspect this is a case of a person well-qualified in one area (crypto)
working in very different area (GPS) where she is not qualified and does
not understand what is going on.
Well, sort of.  The satellites are up at 11,000 miles, which makes for a large
footprint.  You'd certainly see most of the same satellites from several
states away.
Right, that's what several of us have been saying.
Sure, but that is nonsense.  Here's why.
The time delay you need to introduce a 200 mile shift is 1 ms.  The effects
Denning et al. are talking about are LOW FREQUENCY effects.  This is
obvious for orbital perturbations, since we're talking about small motions of
large heavy objects here, and it is also true for the S/A dither. Indeed
it has to be that way, since any high frequency jitter would prevent the
receiver from locking on the spread spectrum code that's at the core of
how GPS works.  In other words, at the millisecond  level, none of those effects exist.
Re Hal's comments:
What a checking system actually observes is: at time T2 it receives
a message that claims to have been generated at time T1 by a system
at location X.  It would accept the authentication as valid if the elapsed
time T2-T1 is small enough to be believable.  How small this is depends
on (a) the transmission latency, (b) the processing delay in X and in
the checker.  There are two flavors of attack on this:
1. Attacker Y uses the real-time signals from the satellites, delayed as
needed.  It sends those after processing, just as X would have done
(except that X doesn't insert the processing delay).  The elapsed time
seen by the checker differs from the case of X by the sum of the
processing delay and the incremental transmission latency (since Y
is at a different place than X, so its connection to the checker may have
either less or more latency).
This fools the checker if the incremental latency is within its tolerance.
Suppose that I'm using a LAN -- in that case a transmit delay on the
order of 1 ms is plausible.  X and Y would be about the same (of course
it has hard for Y to get on the LAN unobserved...).  If X is less than
20 miles away, the processing delay is under 100 microseconds, which
is "in the noise".
If I'm in a WAN, then the latency is likely to be greater, but even if is is
1 ms, I can be many miles away before it becomes obvious.
The above of course assumes that the signal processing is done in
hardware (or fast DSP) so it can indeed be done in well under 1 ms.
Not a big deal...  That seems to be one Denning mistake, the thinking
only of replay in the sense of long delayed spoofing messages.
2. Attacker Y synchronizes to the satellites but constructs a signal
locally that effectively "anticipates" what the satellite is about to send.
This allows it to get the effect of a negative delay (thus avoiding
the "node in the ground" problem).  Since the signal is entirely
predictable at the few-ms level, this is not difficult, though it requires
a bit more effort than the simple delay approach.  This way Y can
construct a signal acceptable to the checker, even if its transmit latency
to the checker is greater than it is for X.  It simply anticipates by
the difference plus whatever it needs to fake the position.
As Hal also pointed out, if the system allows users to have partial
sky view, then the attacker can avoid the need for negative delays
entirely by selecting satellites closer to him than to the legitimate
For anyone interested in an intro to GPS, Trimble (one of the leading
companies in the industry) puts out some skinny paperbacks
with nice clear explanations.  They sometimes are a bit at
the "see Spot run" level, but they do have the correct story.

In the case of the C/A (civilian) code, absolutely.  In the case of the
P code (military) only if you have the key, but in that case, yes.
As Jim Bell pointed out, there are boxes you can buy for
suitable amounts of money that are "GPS simulators" -- they construct
out of whole cloth the signals you would receive if you were at
location X with satellites {Y1, Y2, ...} overhead.
However, if all you set out to do is fool a location authenticator,
deriving shifted location data from the actual satellites is far
easier and bound to be much cheaper.  There is one limitation
this has that the simulator approach doesn't -- delaying real signals
requires having access to the same satellites (or a large enough
subset, i.e., 3-4 of them) that the checking station has overhead.

Fine, but that doesn't address the point missed by the original
article, which is that you don't need to precompute this stuff.
It's easy to compute in real time (under a second) which
eliminates the perturbations issue.  You don't need to worry
about inability to predict those if you're not predicting but
rather measuring/correcting in real time.

Huh?  I don't follow your reasoning.
If you use two random words, the search space for a dictionary attack
with an N word dictionary is N^2.  That's true whether you include a space
or leave it out.  If you use "random punctuation" and the punctuation
character is unknown, you add perhaps a factor 20, which is so much smaller
than N that it isn't worth arguing about.
Two-word passphrases are pretty good, and if you feel uncomfortable
with an N^2 work factor, use three words to get N^3.  That's a much bigger
win than talking about random punctuation characters.

choice would be the Boyer-Moore algorithm.  It has the nice property

@_subject: Net Politics 
Not an unusual thing online (Windows! Mac! Windows! Mac! Linux!).
I swer I had this conversation somewhere recently, and those of us involved
in it came up with one reason this rift seems to come up so often and get
discussed so publically, especially in comparison to our "organized,
determined" opponents. I would hazard a guess that those people working
within the cause of electronic freedoms tend not to be the simple
order-following, authority-heeding sort (compared to, say, followers of the
Religious Right). It's easy if you're Ralph Reed to send out a flyer or get
the telemarketters working and tell the troops what to do. It's not as easy
if you're, say, Jonah Seiger. Not because of Jonah (or Shabbir, or Declan,
or whoever), but because of his audience. It's not a push-button response
with us.
And I'm still not convinced (as I wasn't last year when I was more heavily
involved in some of this) that these differences of opinion have to somehow
be kept behind-closed-doors. That has always stuck me as the way -they- do
it (if I can stoop to using a Them for a moment), and never as a way that
was inherently required.
It's like the Gulf War or something. "Hey, we're at war, stop criticising,
we need to be united!" Hogwash.

While chatting with a friend recently over brown rice in Boulder CO, he
said something that I found raw-ther amusin'. Thought I'd share it. We'd
been discussing bit-sizes of keys vs fifth-generation NSA cryptanalytical

@_subject: ALL OF YOU ARE CRIMINAL HACKERS, I AM GOING TO CALL FBI 
Tips for reporting this 'clandestine' list to the FBI (and it's contributors)
1) Be sure to speak slowly and use small words when contacting the FBI.
2) If you can, be sure to work the words 'Pipe Bomb', 'Olympics', and/or
'TWA' into your sentences.
3) Remember to unsubscribe from the list before reporting it.
4) Try not to be belligerant when the talking with the FBI -  RE: tracking
down cpunks; they're laughing at you, already.
5) Try not to use the word 'inbred' in your report..they seem particullarly
sensitive to this...for some reason.
6) When meeting FBI in person, do not wear shiny objects or bright colors -
it distracts them.
7) When calling the FBI hotline, don't ask to speak to someone about
munition smuggling AND computers crimez - this will put the operator into
8) Be sure to ask for special agent 'Fox Mulder' and 'Dana Sculley' -
they're 'the best'

Dear Wall Street Journal reader:
If you haven't visited the Money & Investing Update in a while, we wanted to
let you know we've made some dramatic changes.  On April 29, we became The
Wall Street Journal Interactive Edition (
That means we've expanded, to bring you the entire spectrum of business
coverage provided by The Wall Street Journal. You'll see not only our
pioneering, continually updated coverage of the markets, but all the most
important stories in technology, marketing, the law--even sports and weather.
We've also added new features we hope make the Interactive Edition even more
useful, such as Personal Journal, which enables you to create your own
personalized view of today's news, and the ability to build and monitor your
own personal stock portfolio.
As a trial subscriber to Money & Investing Update, we are eager to have you
try the Interactive Edition.  So, your User Name and Password for the Update
are valid for the Interactive Edition as well.  Plus, as a special thank you
for your early support, your access to the Interactive Edition WILL CONTINUE
TO BE FREE THROUGH AUGUST 31, 1996, after which time a very modest
subscription fee will be required to continue.
But remember, NO CREDIT CARD OR OTHER PAYMENT INFORMATION is required until
after August 31, and ONLY THEN if you decide you want to join us as a paid
subscriber.  Until then, read the Interactive Edition as often as you like
at no charge.

since then and we encourage you to come back and try again.

The signed message below is what someone sending mail to  would eventually see. Please pass it on to your significant others, so to speak.
FYI, I'll be in Boston at CFP96 from 26 Mar - 2 Apr, so no list-admin-business will likely get done during that period. Expect more news soon after my return about PGP 3.0 and other exciting developments. [ cue music: "Jaws" theme ]
USUAL SUSPECTS WITH PGP ANECDOTES SOUGHT:
Anyone who has an anus-clenching anecdote, an amusing remembrance or just an aprocryphal Jonah+Whale-tale about their experiences with PGP is encouraged to send it to  for inclusion in an upcoming anthology (authors will be credited). Now's your chance to recount for all Posterity the adventurous days gone by when you were dropped behind enemy lines (Vienna, VA?) with only a laptop, your trusty educational PGP freeware and your McGyver-esque ingenuity. Do it soon, though if you want your name up in electrons: disk space is limited. ;)

@_subject: Are you getting loads of $5 orders in your mailbox everyday? I am !! 
I Never Thought I'd Be the One Telling You This:
I Actually Read a Piece of e-mail and I'm Going to Europe on the Proceeds!
My name is Karen Liddell; I'm a 35-year-old mom,wife, and part-time
accountant.  As a rule, I delete all unsolicited "junk" e-mail and use my
account primarily for business.  I received what I assumed was this same
e-mail countless times and deleted it each time.
About two months ago I received it again and, because of the catchy line, I
finally read it.  Afterwards, I thought, "OK, I give in, I'm going to try
this.  I can certainly afford to invest $20 and, on the other hand, there's
nothing wrong with creating a little excess cash."  I promptly mailed four $5
bills and, after receiving the reports, sent out some e-mail advertisements.
 After reading the reports, I also learned how easy it is to bulk e-mail for
I was not prepared for the results.  Everyday for the last six weeks, my P.O.
box has been overflowing with $5 bills; many days the excess fills up an
extra mail bin and I've had to upgrade to the corporate-size box!  I am
stunned by all the money that keeps rolling in!
My husband and I have been saving for several years to make a substantial
downpayment on a house.  Now, not only are we purchasing a house with 40%
down, we're going to Venice, Italy to celebrate!
I promise you, if you follow the directions in this e-mail and be prepared to
eventually set aside about an hour each day to follow up (and count your
money!), you will make at least as much money as we did.  You don't need to
be a wiz at the computer, but I'll bet you already are.  If you can open an
envelope, remove the money, and send an e-mail message, then you're on your
way to the bank.  Take the time to read this so you'll understand how easy it
is.  If I can do this, so can you!
The following is a copy of the e-mail I read:
                  This is a LEGAL, MONEY-MAKING PHENOMENON.
        PRINT this letter, read the directions, THEN READ IT AGAIN!!!
You are about to embark on the most profitable and unique program you may
ever see.  Many times over, it has demonstrated and proven its ability to
generate large amounts of CASH.  This program is showing fantastic appeal
with a huge and ever-growing on-line population desirous of additional
This is a legitimate, LEGAL, money-making opportunity.  It does not require
you to come in contact with people, do any hard work, and best of all, you
never have to leave the house, except to get the mail and go to the bank!
This truly is the lucky break you've been waiting for!  Simply follow the
easy instructions in this letter, and your financial dreams will come true!
 When followed correctly, this multi-level marketing program works
perfectly..100% EVERY TIME!
Thousands of people have used this program to:
     - Raise capital to start their own business
     - Pay off debts
     - Buy homes, cars, etc.
This is your chance, don't pass it up!
OVERVIEW OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY ELECTRONIC MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING PROGRAM
This is what you will do to reach financial freedom:
You will send thousands of people a product for $5.00 that costs next to
nothing to produce and e-mail.  As with all multi-level businesses, you will
increase your business building your downline and selling the products
(reports).  Every state in the U.S. allows you to recruit new multi-level
business online (via your computer).
The products in this program are a series of four business and financial
reports costing $5.00 each.  Each order you receive via "snail mail" will
     -$5.00 cash
     -The name and number of the report they are ordering
     -The e-mail address where you will e-mail them the report they ordered.
To fill each order, you simply e-mail the product to the buyer.  THAT'S IT!
 The $5.00 is yours!  This is the EASIEST multi-level marketing business
FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE LETTER AND BE PREPARED TO REAP THE STAGGERING
*******I N S T R U C T I O N S*********
This is what you MUST do:
1. Order all 4 reports shown on the list below.
*For each report, send $5.00 CASH, the NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE
ORDERING, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS, and YOUR RETURN POSTAL ADDRESS (in case of a
problem) to the person whose name appears on the list next to the report.
*When you place your order, make sure you order each of the four reports.
 You will need all four reports so that you can save them on your computer
and resell them.
*Usually within 10 days you will receive, via e-mail, the four reports.  Save
them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the
1,000's of people who will order them from you.
2. IMPORTANT-DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each
report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than is instructed
below in steps "a" through "f" or you will lose out on the majority of your
profits.  Once you understand the way this works, you'll also see how it
doesn't work if you change it.!!  Remember, this method has been tested, and i
f you alter it , it will not work.
a.  Look below for the listing of available reports.
b.  After you've ordered the four reports, take this advertisement and remove
the address under REPORT   This person has made it through the cycle and
is no doubt counting their 50 grand!
c.  Move the name and address under REPORT  down to REPORT d.  Move the name and address under REPORT  down to REPORT e.  Move the name and address under REPORT  down to REPORT f.  Insert your name and address in the REPORT  position.
  Please make sure that you copy everyone's name and address ACCURATELY!!!
3. Take this entire letter, including the modified list of names, and save it
to your computer.  Make NO changes to the instruction portion of this letter.
4. Now you,re ready to start an advertising campaign on the WORLDWIDE WEB!
 Advertising on the WEB is very inexpensive, and there are HUNDREDS of FREE
places to advertise.  Another avenue you could use for advertising is e-mail
lists.  You can buy these lists for under $20 for 2,000 addresses or you can
pay someone a minimal charge to take care of it for you.
5.  For every $5.00 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the report
that they ordered.  THAT'S IT!  ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON ALL
ORDERS!  This will gaurantee that the e-mail THEY send out with YOUR name and
address on it, will be prompt because they can't advertise until they receive
the report!
AVAILABLE REPORTS
******Order Each REPORT by NUMBER and NAME******
-  ALWAYS SEND $5 CASH FOR EACH REPORT (checks not accepted)
-  Make sure that the cash is concealed by wrapping it in two sheets of paper
-  On one of those sheets of paper, include:  1.) the NUMBER and NAME of the
report you are ordering, 2.) your e-mail address and 3.) your postal address
(in case of problems) It is suggested that you rent a mailbox to avoid having
your home address being sent to millions of peolple.

   HERE'S HOW THIS AMAZING PLAN WILL MAKE YOU MONEY$
Let's say that you decide to start small just to see how well it works.
 Assume your goal is to get 10 people to participate on your first level.
 (Placing a lot of FREE ads on the internet will EASILY get a larger
response.)  Also assume that everyone else in your organization gets ONLY 10
downline members.  Follow this example to achieve the STAGGERING results
1st level-your 10 members with $5........................................
2nd level-10 members from those 10($5 x 100)..........................$500
3rd level-10 members from those 100($5 x 1,000)......................$5,000
4th level-10 members from those 1,000($5 x 10,000).................$50,000
                                       THIS TOTALS-----------$55,500
Remember friends, this assumes that the people who participate on;y recruit
10 people each.  Think for a moment what would happen if they got 20 people
to participate!  Most peolple get 100's of participants.  THINK ABOUT IT!
Your cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely you can
afford $20).  You obviously already have an internet connection and e-mail is
*****TIPS FOR SUCCESS*****
*  TREAT THIS AS YOUR BUSINESS!  Be prompt, professional, and follow the
    directions accurately.
*  Send for the four reports immediately so you will have them when the
   start coming in because:
When you receive a $5 order, you MUST send out the requested product/report
to comply with the U.S. Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 3005 in
the U.S. Code, also Code of Federal Regulations vol. 16, sections 255 and
436, which state that "a product or service must be exchanged for money
*  ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME DAY SERVICE ON THE ORDERS YOU RECEIVE.
*  Be patient and persistent with this program.  If you follow the
instructions exactly
   the results will undoubtedly be SUCCESSFUL!
*  ABOVE ALL, HAVE FAITH IN YOURSELF AND KNOW YOU WILL SUCCEED!
*****YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINE*****
Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:
If you don't receive 10 to 20 orders for REPORT  within two weeks, continue
advertising until you do.  Then, a couple of weeks later you should receive
at least 100 orders for REPORT   If you don't, continue advertising until
you do.  Once you have received 100 or more orders for REPORT  YOU CAN
RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will
continue to roll in!
THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER:
Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a
DIFFERENT report.  You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which
report people are ordering from you.  If you want to generate more income,
send another batch of e-mails and start the whole process again!  There is no
limit to the income you will generate from this business!
*****T E S T I M O N I A L S*****
This Program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY!  Especially the rule
of not trying to place your name in a different position, it won't work and
you'll lose alot of potential income.  I'm living proof that it works.  It
really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money, with little cost
to you.  If you do choose to participate, follow the program exactly, and
you'll be on your way to financial security.                  Sean

My name is Frank.  My wife Doris, and I live in Bel-Air, MD.  I am a cost
accountant with a major U.S. corporation and I make pretty good money.  When
I received the program I grumbled to Doris about receiving "junk mail".  I
made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and the
percentages involved.  I "knew" it wouldn't work.  Doris totally ignored my
supposed intelligence and jumped in with both feet.  I made merciless fun of
her, and was ready to lay the old "I told you so" on her when the thing
didn't work... well, the laugh was on me!  Within 2 weeks she had received
over 50 responses.  Within 45 days she had received over $147,200 in $5
bills!  I was shocked!  I was sure that I had it all figured and that it
wouldn't work.  I AM a believer now.  I have joined Doris in her "hobby".  I
did have 7 more years until retirement, but I think of the "rat race" and
it's not for me.  We owe it all to MLM.                          Frank T.,

The main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is
honest, lawful, extremely profitable, and is a way to get a large amount of
money in a short time.  I was approached several times before I checked this
out.  I joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal
effort and money required.  To my astonishment, I received $36,470.00 in the
first 14 weeks, with money still coming in.                     Sincerely
Yours, Phillip A. Brown
Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to
participate in this plan.  But conservative that I am, I decided that the
initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't
get enough orders to at least get my money back.  Boy, was I surprised when I
found my medium-size post office box crammed with orders!  For awhile, it got
so overloaded that I had to start picking up my mail at the window.  I'll
make more money this year than in any 10 years of my life before.  The nice
thing about this deal is that it doesn't matter where in the U.S. the people
live.  There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return.
                     Mary Rockland, Lansing, MI
This is my third time to participate in this plan.  We have quit our jobs,
and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the interest on our money.
 The only way on earth that this plan will work for you is if you do it.  For

@_subject: Women cannot commit rape? 
This is true in the United States as well.  That's why in every state,
technically speaking, their is no crime of "rape" just varying degrees and
types of "criminal sexual assault".  I'm suprised that hasn't trickled down
to france yet.  Rape is defined as forcing someone to have sexual
intercourse.  It doesn't take much imagination to build an argument that
you can't force a man to have sex, after all he had to get aroused.  The
advantage of criminal sexual assualt is that it side steps these kind of
issues by greatly broadening the crime to basicly forcing/manipulating
someone  to engae in any kind of sexual activity.
"DOS/WIN based computers manufactured by companies such as IBM, Compaq,
Tandy, and millions of others, are by far the most popular, with about 70
million machines in use worldwide. Macintosh fans, on the other hand, note
that cockroaches are far more numerous than humans, and that numbers alone
do not denote a higher life form." - New York Times

SF Bay Area Cypherpunks
October 2001 Physical Meeting Announcement
GENERAL INFO:
  DATE:  Saturday 13 October 2001
  TIME:  1:00-6:00 PM (Pacific Time)
 PLACE:  Tressider Student Union Courtyard
         Stanford University Campus
         Palo Alto, California, USA
This Cypherpunks meeting will begin forming around 12:00 PM, and the structured Agenda will begin at approximately 1:00 PM.
 "Our agenda is a widely-held secret."
 As usual, this is an Open Meeting on US Soil, and everyone's invited
 ...yes, even the Director of Homeland Defense.
 1. Recent Cypherpunk News
Various Cypherpunks have been on the road recently, and will share important news updates and colorful stories with us about their CryptoRights Foundation representatives will also have some very good news about CRF's recent progress.
 2. Anti-Terrorism
This meeting will feature a discussion on the implications for our open society of two major legislative proposals resulting from the recent crimes against humanity in NY, DC and PA. The Mobilization Against Terrorism Act (MATA) and it's follow-on, the Uniting and Strengthening America (USA) Act, are dramatic new proposals creating major arguments in Congress. They include provisions that:
 * Define "computer intrusions" as a (federal) Terrorism offense.
 * Add convicted krackers to a central federal DNA database.
 * Remove wiretap restrictions on email scanning, web surveillance and
    voicemail inspections by law enforcement.
 * Remove controls on roving (person-specific) wiretaps, implying     wiretap capability in all communications infrastructures.
 * Allow LEAs to share wiretap data with any Executive Branch employee.
 * Make domestic surveillance easier under FISA (Foreign Intel Surv Act)
 * Provide US intelligence agencies with access to Grand Jury documents.
 * Let the President designate US Citizens as FISA surveillance targets.
 * Create free speech restrictions on "expert advice" to USG-defined     "terrorists".
 * Authorize the CIA to "hire terrorists".
In addition to MATA and USAA, the Administration has established a new (soon to be Cabinet) position heading the Office of Homeland Defense (OHD) for coordination of law enforcement and intelligence efforts, including centralization of databases storing information about US Citizens.
These new initiatives have all been positioned and marketed to voters as making Americans safer from the scourge of global Terrorism, but we'll be asking the tough, skeptical questions:
 Q: Will these initiatives really make our lives more secure or simply
     make the US a Police State?
 Q: Assuming these proposals work, are they worth sacrificing our civil
     liberties?
We'll also discuss the amendments proposed by Russell Feingold (D-WI) to the USAA which:
 * Bar police from performing court-ordered "secret searches".
 * Narrow the ability the bill gives employers, schools and public     libraries to spy on users, rather than allowing spying on     all "computer trespassers".
 * Protect medical/academic records by requiring a judge's permission
    instead of giving police access to all "tangible" data.
 * Modify "roving wiretaps" to permit eavesdropping only when the     target is on specific hardware but not when others use it.
In addition, our resident legal eagles will help us evaluate the Constitutionality of these measures, and we'll also include a discussion the Snake-Oil Protection Act (aka the DMCA), and the wisdom of letting people who do not design security systems write legislation affecting everyone's security.

 3. CRF Human Rights Security Policy Design Session A good security policy is essential to good security in any organization and many organizations don't know where to start. CryptoRights is designing a comprehensive security policy template for our human rights NGO clients, and we need the active participation of the Cypherpunk Community. Please send and/or bring non-proprietary policy documents/doc fragments, FAQs, URLs, papers you've written or read, books you use and any other resources you can think of regarding security policy design. We'll spread it all out on the floor and begin brainstorming and creating the ultimate security policy document in the first session of many.
This document will be a showplace for Cypherpunk core competency. CRF and its client NGOs and partners will be able to use it or portions of it to bootstrap the wide adoption of a variety of communications security tools, in order to establish their utility for the global To add to the overall complexity of such a project, we also have to contend with the new politics in the post-9/11 world. It's going to have to be an amazingly flexible and comprehensive document built from many different security professionals' experiences and Our many design challenges include:
 * Flexible threat model definitions  * Encryption tool interfaces and training requirements  * Fieldworker security and travel considerations  * NGO security team qualifications and administrator credentials  * Law enforcement issues  * Integration with small/wearable platforms  * Revocation issues  * Authentication guidelines and procedures for online documents  * Physical security considerations  * Interfacing with other NGO security infrastructures  * Surveillance and counter-surveillance  * Protections from terrorists  * Field intelligence and urban counter-intelligence  * Human rights trustgroup trust models  * Evidence authentication and encryption frameworks  * E-commerce and digital cash for human rights NGOs  * Voice encryption and radio/telephony tradecraft  * Human rights public key infrastructure management  * Secret sharing requirements and guidelines  * Keyservers  * Hardware security tokens  * Biometrics  * Privacy policy  * Remailers and identity management guidelines and technology  * IPsec and DNSsec capabilities  * ...and more Bring, laptops, pads of paper, whiteboard markers and your thinking caps!

   The Stanford meeting location will be familiar to those who've been to our
   outdoor summer meetings before, but for those who haven't been, it's on the
   Stanford University campus (in Palo Alto, California), at the end of    Santa Theresa, at the tables outside Tressider Union, just west of    Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
   We meet at the tables on the West side of the building, inside the
   horseshoe "U" formed by the Tressider building. Ask anyone on campus    where "Tressider" or the "Student Union" is and they'll help you find it.
   If the weather is bad, we'll meet inside.

@_subject: What good are smartcard readers for PCs 
--
James A. Donald>
I have found that the administrative costs of PKI are
intolerable. End users do not really understand crypto, and so
will fuck up. Only engineers can really control a PKI
certificate, and for the most part they just do not.
In principle the thingness of a smartcard should reduce
administrative costs to a low level -- they should supposedly
act like a purse, a key, a credit card, hence near zero user
training required.  The simulated thingness created by
cryptographic cleverness should be manifested to the user as
physical thingness of the card.
Suppose, for example, we had working Chaumian digicash.  Now
imagine how much trouble the average end user is going to get
into with backups, and with moving digicash from one computer
to another.  If all unused Chaumian tokens live in a smartcard,
one might expect the problem to vanish.  The purselike
character of the card sustains the coin like character of
Chaumian tokens.
Of course if one has to supply the correct driver for the smart
card, then the administration problem reappears.
USB smartcard interfaces could solve this problem.   Just plug
them in, and bingo, it should just go.  Ummh, wait a moment, go
where, do what?  What happens when one plugs in a USB smartcard
Still, making crypto embodied in smart cards intelligible to
the masses would seem to be a soluble problem, even if not yet
solved, whereas software only crypto is always going to boggle
the masses.

References: Yes/no.  When your not logged in your home folder is stored as an encrypted DiskImage.  In addition part of enabling FileVault was a complete rework of how login authentication was handled, part of which included removing the 8 char limitation.  For the record, apple has always allowed passwords longer than 8 char, prior to 10.3, however, only the first 8 char were used to log you in, though the other characters were used to unlock your keychain.
No they are not.  Apple considers DiskImages to be a proprietary competitive advantage.
It is a virtual certainty that Apple used Security.framework which includes a variety of algorithms (including AES) and secure/peer reviewed operation modes.  I believe the security framework is open source, and in fact based on a broader standard (CDSA).  If you'd like to know for certain I'd suggest you email dts at apple.com and/or file a bug report at bugreporter.apple.com (requires free registration) on the documentation.

Вот уже несколько лет на телеканале СТС выходит в эфир  программа   "6 кадров". Шесть актеров разыгрывают короткие скетчи на разные темы. Сегодня эта программа завоевала популярность у зрителя, о чем свидетельствуют высокие рейтинги и народная любовь. Но мало кто знает, что за плечами всех артистов, создающих программу, огромный опыт работы в различных театрах и на эстраде. Телевидение, несмотря на огромные возможности, имеет и жесткие ограничения со страшным и загадочным  названием формат. И в формате телепрограммы невозможно показать зрителю все, что актеры "6 кадров" умеют и хотели бы показать. Поэтому, совершенно закономерно появление "Шесть кадров шоу". Но это не театральная версия телепрограммы, на сцене вы увидите то, что никогда не увидите по телевизору. Знакомые всем артисты выступят в самых неожиданных  амплуа и в разных жанрах. За время спектакля зрители успеют побывать в оперетте и послушать оперу, насладиться почти цирковыми номерами и поучаствовать в настоящих съемках. А еще музыкальная эксцентрика, танцы, песни, конечно, новые скетчи и много-много всего интересного. Одним словом "Шесть кадров шоу"!!! Театр "Сатирикон" Адрес: улица Шереметьевская, д. 8. Тел.

Quantum cryptography can't be broken by factorisation. Could it one day replace standard cryptosystems?
 short distances it wouldn't be too hard to build a quantum key distribution network to encrypt data. Over longer distances, you would need quantum repeaters every 50 kilometres or so on the fibre-optic network, as it's difficult to maintain a quantum state over long distances. Even if they are cheap by then, it's a lot of investment.
=====end of quote=====
My fiber optic invention has a certain relevance here. A typical modern germania-doped-core (GeO2) silica optical fiber has a loss of about 0.19 decibels/kilometer (db/km).  Over 50 km, the loss is (50 km x 0.19 db/km) = 9.5 db, ignoring splice losses.  (A good splice has a loss of about 0.10 db.)  So, the quote above is indicating that above a loss of about 10 db, a quantum system is hard to maintain.  I have suggested in my patent application that isotope-modified fiber (where the Si-29 level is brought from nature's 4.67% (atom/atom) to 0.10 %, the loss might decrease by a factor of 10 to 20.  This means that the ultimate distance limit might increase to 50 x 10 = 500 km, to 50 x 20 = 1000 km.  That would be a major improvement if it works.
The reason that this new fiber would be necessary is this:  Ever since the invention of the EDFA (Erbium-doped fiber amplifier    ) in 1986, it has been used to amplify IR signals in the 1510-1560 nanometer band.  Using it and ordinary signals (not quantum signals) it is possible to go about 125 kilometers between amplifiers.  (In other words, that usage tolerates about 25 db of optical loss before an EDFA is necessary.)  However, apparently an EDFA cannot be used to amplify a quantum system.       Or, at least, not directly.

it would not be able to crack well-engineered public key cryptography. Martin Hellman, a former Stanford researcher who led the team that first invented the technique, said NSA experts tried to talk him and others into believing that the keys did not have to be as large as they The stakes rose when more technology companies adopted RSA's methods and Internet use began to soar. The Clinton administration embraced the Clipper Chip, envisioned as a mandatory component in phones and computers to enable officials to overcome encryption with a warrant.
RSA led a fierce public campaign against the effort, distributing posters with a foundering sailing ship and the words "Sink Clipper!"
A key argument against the chip was that overseas buyers would shun U.S. technology products if they were ready-made for spying. Some companies say that is just what has happened in the wake of the Snowden The White House abandoned the Clipper Chip and instead relied on export controls to prevent the best cryptography from crossing U.S. borders. RSA once again rallied the industry, and it set up an Australian division that could ship what it wanted.
"We became the tip of the spear, so to speak, in this fight against government efforts," Bidzos recalled in an oral history.
RSA EVOLVES
RSA and others claimed victory when export restrictions relaxed.
But the NSA was determined to read what it wanted, and the quest gained urgency after the September 11, 2001 attacks.
RSA, meanwhile, was changing. Bidzos stepped down as CEO in 1999 to concentrate on VeriSign, a security certificate company that had been spun out of RSA. The elite lab Bidzos had founded in Silicon Valley moved east to Massachusetts, and many top engineers left the company, several former employees said.
And the BSafe toolkit was becoming a much smaller part of the company. By 2005, BSafe and other tools for developers brought in just $27.5 million of RSA's revenue, less than 9% of the $310 million total.
"When I joined there were 10 people in the labs, and we were fighting the NSA," said Victor Chan, who rose to lead engineering and the Australian operation before he left in 2005. "It became a very different company later on."
By the first half of 2006, RSA was among the many technology companies seeing the U.S. government as a partner against overseas hackers.
New RSA Chief Executive Art Coviello and his team still wanted to be seen as part of the technological vanguard, former employees say, and the NSA had just the right pitch. Coviello declined an interview An algorithm called Dual Elliptic Curve, developed inside the agency, was on the road to approval by the National Institutes of Standards and Technology as one of four acceptable methods for generating random numbers. NIST's blessing is required for many products sold to the government and often sets a broader de facto standard.
RSA adopted the algorithm even before NIST approved it. The NSA then cited the early use of Dual Elliptic Curve inside the government to argue successfully for NIST approval, according to an official familiar with the proceedings.
RSA's contract made Dual Elliptic Curve the default option for producing random numbers in the RSA toolkit. No alarms were raised, former employees said, because the deal was handled by business leaders rather than pure technologists.
"The labs group had played a very intricate role at BSafe, and they were basically gone," said labs veteran Michael Wenocur, who left in 1999.
Within a year, major questions were raised about Dual Elliptic Curve. Cryptography authority Bruce Schneier wrote that the weaknesses in the formula "can only be described as a back door."
After reports of the back door in September, RSA urged its customers to stop using the Dual Elliptic Curve number generator.
But unlike the Clipper Chip fight two decades ago, the company is saying little in public, and it declined to discuss how the NSA entanglements have affected its relationships with customers.
The White House, meanwhile, says it will consider this week's panel recommendation that any efforts to subvert cryptography be abandoned.

Secrets".
    You commented about my
 "truly phenomenal discovery".   I have sent you a copy of the as-published PCT (Patent Cooperation Treaty), for my isotopically-modified optical fiber invention.  Corning says that 300 billion meters of optical fiber are made each year; If I get 10% market penetration, that's 30 billion meters.  At $0.25 per meter of  fiber royalty, that's $7.5 billion per year, or $150 billion over the patent's 20-year lifetime.
    However, this is only one of a few dozen inventions I have thought of involving isotopically-modified materials, although it is the most readily doable and is like the most profitable.  In principle, however, my fiber optic inventions number far more than this:  The main problem is that isotope separation is rather expensive, and any such invention isn't worth doing unless the benefit from the material or device exceeds the cost of that separation.  The main reason my optical
 fiber is practical is that the isotopically-modified core of the 125-micron fiber is only about 30 microns in diameter, so that it uses very little isotopically-modified material.   My estimate of 5000 patents is still reasonable, based on what I know now, but it will require the development of ever-cheaper ways of separating isotopes.
    The article says (page 133) that "he had fired practically every court-appointed lawyer ever assigned to him".   Actually, that is absolutely NOT true, although the truth requires some explanation that you didn't bother to ask me.   I could say, accurately, that I "Never"  fired ANY attorney, but again that requires some explanation.  (More precisely, I never SUCCEEDED in firing ANY lawyer:  In every circumstance where I tried to fire an attorney, that attorney was continued to be forced upon me, for weeks, months, or in one
 case years, and if and when that attorney finally withdrew, it wasn't because _I_ wanted him to leave, it was because he (or she) had finally achieved the damage to me that he (or she) was trying to do, and he (or she) obtained the permission of the judge to withdraw.
    You have a major responsibility here!  To my recollection, you NEVER asked me about me 'firing' any attorney, yet you put this material in your book as if it were true.  You have based your commentary on these false 'facts', and you didn't check with me to see if I had a correction or other explanation.
    Peter Avenia was my first attorney (1997-1999).   I never even tried to fire him.  And, in fact, I tried to get the judge (Burgess) in about April 1999 to REFUSE Avenia's request to withdraw.  Why?  In 1998, I consented to an unnecessary 'mental evaluation' (in Springfield Missouri)
 based on Avenia's promise that he would investigate my allegations that the government had been spying on me.  In fact, the only basis for the government's request for a 'mental evaluation' was my claim that the government was spying on me!   Please note that the government didn't deny that it had been spying; the prosecutor didn't comment on that.  Can you see why this is a problem?  It turns out that the government was, indeed, spying on me, including during the period of April 1998 and June 1998, after which they arrested me for a 'supervised violation'.  In fact, they had placed a tracking device in at least one of my parents' cars (A Lincoln).
     "What's wrong with that", you might ask?  Well, in 2012 the US Supreme Court ruled (U.S. v. Jones) that such a placement was a "search" under the 4th Amendment.  Indeed, in a 1999 9th Circuit Court of Appeals case (U.S. v.
 McIver) , that court ruled that it was legal (under certain circumstances inapplicable to me) for 'cops' (term used generically) to place a tracking device on a subject's car.  Problem was, in the McIver there was actually a CRIME being investigated (Marijuana growing) and the subject was directly linked to that crime.  In stark contrast, I was neither suspected or known to have been involved in any crime, then-past, then-present, or then-future.   In other words, these Feds actually just placed the tracking on the car without any legitimate law-enforcement reason.  They did not want, however, to have the fact of their arguably-illegal placement of the tracking devices(s) openly mentioned in any court hearing.  I, quite the opposite, DEMANDED to my attorney, Avenia, that he verify the tracking device(s) placement, and argue the matter in court.  He promised to do that, in mid 1998, but he later (April 1999) broke his
 promise by resigning, and his replacement also refused.  In other words, I was denied an actual defense due to the collusion of two of 'my' attorneys as well as the government.
    One of the major things I wanted to do was to prove that the Feds were employing what should be illegal tactics (such as the GPS tracking device) not for any legitimate reason, but simply because they considered me to be their 'enemy', not because they thought I was going to commit any crime.   I wanted to be able to show that they were "offending" against me, because of (among other things) my allegation that they had employed a jailhouse snitch ("Ryan Thomas Lund") to attack me, which he did on November 25, 1997.  (See version 1.06 of my Portland Oregon Federal Court lawsuit, 02-1052, version filed in July of 2003.
   Avenia agreed to have an investigator do that.  I went to
 that (useless) evaluation, but when I returned I continued to insist on the investigation that Avenia had promised.  Indeed, he eventually did send an investigator ("Sharon Callas") to do an investigation, in Vancouver Washington.  Mysteriously, she resigned very shortly after doing that investigation, and I was never given the results.
    Avenia was allowed (by the Judge, Burgess, now dead) to resign in about April 1999.  I objected at a court hearing, because I had gotten Avenia to PROMISE to do an investigation, and I was afraid (correctly, as it turns out) that any replacement of him would fail or refuse to bring out the issues concerning the government's crimes and misdeeds against me.
     More tomorrow.

on the narcotics, and the running of the shop where others can sell
those narcotics. ie. the normal witch hunt on drugs.
I get the impression that the use of bitcoin to hide identities is the
problem. Not the bitcoin itself. There are references at paragraph 12b:
use of a  Bitcoin "tumbler" to hide origins of individual transactions.
In paragraph 15: "Ulbricht has required ... Bitcoins, an electronic
currency designed to be as anonymous as cash".
The good news:
The FBI-author even states that "Bitcoins are not illegal in and of
themselves and have known legitimate uses. (Para 21.v)
In fact, they have been declared legal in Germany. You need to pay tax
on them, over there....
So, the biggest challenge is to make sure the general public gets to
know this fact.

the most important attack to mitigate.  This is because:  we know it
is done to everyone, and therefore it is done to our users, and it
informs every other attack.  For all the other targetted and active
attacks, we have far less certainty about the targetting (user) and
the vulnerability (platform, etc).  And they are very costly, by
several orders of magnitude more than mass surveillance.

of Linux, along with their large corporate/government connections,
hasn’t been just about spying, but about losing the distributed
engineering quality of Linux, with Red Hat centralizing control. Yet as
an ex-cypherpunk and crypto software developer, as soon as I started
using Linux years ago, I noted that all the major distributions used
watered-down encryption (to use stronger encryption in many areas, such
as AES-loop, you needed to compile your own kernel and go to great
lengths to manually bypass barriers they put in place to the use of
genuinely strong encryption). This told me then that those who
controlled distributions were deeply in the pockets of intelligence
networks. So it comes as no surprise to me that they jumped on board
systemd when told to, despite the mock choice publicized to users –
there was never any option.
A computer, and especially hosting services (which often run Linux), are
powerful communication and broadcasting systems into today’s world. If
you control and have unfettered access to such systems, you basically
control the world. As Assange notes in the talk, encryption is only as
strong as its endpoints. eg if you’re running a very secure protocol on
a system with a compromised OS, you’re owned.
As Assange observed:
    “The sharing of information, the communication of free peoples,
across history and across geography, is something that creates,
maintains, and disciplines laws [governments].”

They were never able to openly acknowledge I was right, although by my release from prison in March 2012, I checked their website and saw that they had corrected their prior, incorrect position.            Jim "Al Capone" Bell

@_author: Patent Cooperation Treaty 
@_subject: unknown_subject 
You commented about my "truly phenomenal discovery".  I have sent you a copy of the as-published PCT (Patent Cooperation Treaty), for my isotopically-modified optical fiber invention.  Corning says that 300 billion meters of optical fiber are made each year; If I get 10% market penetration, that's 30 billion meters.  At $0.25 per meter of  fiber royalty, that's $7.5 billion per year, or $150 billion over the patent's 20-year lifetime.
    However, this is only one of a few dozen inventions I have thought of involving isotopically-modified materials, although it is the most readily doable and is like the most profitable.  In principle, however, my fiber optic inventions number far more than this:  The main problem is that isotope separation is rather expensive, and any such invention isn't worth doing unless the benefit from the material or device exceeds the cost of that separation.  The main reason my optical fiber is practical is that the isotopically-modified core of the 125-micron fiber is only about 30 microns in diameter, so that it uses very little isotopically-modified material.  My estimate of 5000 patents is still reasonable, based on what I know now, but it will require the development of ever-cheaper ways of separating isotopes.
    The article says (page 133) that "he had fired practically every court-appointed lawyer ever assigned to him".  Actually, that is absolutely NOT true, although the truth requires some explanation that you didn't bother to ask me.  I could say, accurately, that I "Never"  fired ANY attorney, but again that requires some explanation.  (More precisely, I never SUCCEEDED in firing ANY lawyer:  In every circumstance where I tried to fire an attorney, that attorney was continued to be forced upon me, for weeks, months, or in one case years, and if and when that attorney finally withdrew, it wasn't because _I_ wanted him to leave, it was because he (or she) had finally achieved the damage to me that he (or she) was trying to do, and he (or she) obtained the permission of the judge to withdraw.
    You have a major responsibility here!  To my recollection, you NEVER asked me about me 'firing' any attorney, yet you put this material in your book as if it were true.  You have based your commentary on these false 'facts', and you didn't check with me to see if I had a correction or other explanation.
    Peter Avenia was my first attorney (1997-1999).  I never even tried to fire him.  And, in fact, I tried to get the judge (Burgess) in about April 1999 to REFUSE Avenia's request to withdraw.  Why?  In 1998, I consented to an unnecessary 'mental evaluation' (in Springfield Missouri) based on Avenia's promise that he would investigate my allegations that the government had been spying on me.  In fact, the only basis for the government's request for a 'mental evaluation' was my claim that the government was spying on me!  Please note that the government didn't deny that it had been spying; the prosecutor didn't comment on that.  Can you see why this is a problem?  It turns out that the government was, indeed, spying on me, including during the period of April 1998 and June 1998, after which they arrested me for a 'supervised violation'.  In fact, they had placed a tracking device in at least one of my parents' cars (A Lincoln).
    "What's wrong with that", you might ask?  Well, in 2012 the US Supreme Court ruled (U.S. v. Jones) that such a placement was a "search" under the 4th Amendment.  Indeed, in a 1999 9th Circuit Court of Appeals case (U.S. v. McIver) , that court ruled that it was legal (under certain circumstances inapplicable to me) for 'cops' (term used generically) to place a tracking device on a subject's car.  Problem was, in the McIver there was actually a CRIME being investigated (Marijuana growing) and the subject was directly linked to that crime.  In stark contrast, I was neither suspected or known to have been involved in any crime, then-past, then-present, or then-future.  In other words, these Feds actually just placed the tracking on the car without any legitimate law-enforcement reason.  They did not want, however, to have the fact of their arguably-illegal placement of the tracking devices(s) openly mentioned in any court hearing.  I, quite the
 opposite, DEMANDED to my attorney, Avenia, that he verify the tracking device(s) placement, and argue the matter in court.  He promised to do that, in mid 1998, but he later (April 1999) broke his promise by resigning, and his replacement also refused.  In other words, I was denied an actual defense due to the collusion of two of 'my' attorneys as well as the government.
    One of the major things I wanted to do was to prove that the Feds were employing what should be illegal tactics (such as the GPS tracking device) not for any legitimate reason, but simply because they considered me to be their 'enemy', not because they thought I was going to commit any crime.  I wanted to be able to show that they were "offending" against me, because of (among other things) my allegation that they had employed a jailhouse snitch ("Ryan Thomas Lund") to attack me, which he did on November 25, 1997.  (See version 1.06 of my Portland Oregon Federal Court lawsuit, 02-1052, version filed in July of 2003.
  Avenia agreed to have an investigator do that.  I went to that (useless) evaluation, but when I returned I continued to insist on the investigation that Avenia had promised.  Indeed, he eventually did send an investigator ("Sharon Callas") to do an investigation, in Vancouver Washington.  Mysteriously, she resigned very shortly after doing that investigation, and I was never given the results.
    Avenia was allowed (by the Judge, Burgess, now dead) to resign in about April 1999.  I objected at a court hearing, because I had gotten Avenia to PROMISE to do an investigation, and I was afraid (correctly, as it turns out) that any replacement of him would fail or refuse to bring out the issues concerning the government's crimes and misdeeds against me.
    More tomorrow.

Reports surfaced last month suggesting that Carnegie Mellon University
(CMU) has been helping
the FBI crack Tor, the secure browsing application used by
privacy-conscious Internet users for both legal and illegal activities.
Normally, an academic institution assisting law enforcement in fighting
crime wouldn’t raise any eyebrows, particularly if that assistance came
in the form of responding to subpoenas. But this isn’t your average
case. Beyond the complicated (and unclear) set of facts involved, CMU
houses the Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center
(CERT/CC), one of the world’s most important hubs for coordinating
information about various cybersecurity vulnerabilities and attacks.
More than a month after the news first broke, the details are murky at
best. Tor has alleged
that the FBI paid CMU to crack the system’s anonymity feature in
exchange for payment. CMU’s own statement
about the incident says that many of the media reports have been
inaccurate, but acknowledges that the university — and by extension
CERT/CC — complies with valid subpoenas that it receives (as it must).
It also said that it receives “no funding for compliance.” The FBI has
that reports on the payment are inaccurate, but stopped short of saying
no payment was made. And Tor has responded
by saying that these vague responses raise a whole host of questions on
their own.
The public saga leading up to the recent accusations began in July 2014,
when Ed Felten, the then-director of Princeton’s Center for Information
Technology Policy, noted
that CERT/CC researchers at CMU had submitted a presentation abstract to
organizers of the Black Hat security conference discussing a new
vulnerability they had found in Tor. The timing of CERT/CC’s pitch to
Black Hat aligned with a large-scale attack on Tor that lasted from
January to July 2014, during which CERT/CC researchers shared only
“hints” about the vulnerability they had discovered. As for the
abstract, it was abruptly withdrawn in July when CMU failed to approve
the content of the talk for public release.
Eyebrows were again raised in January 2015, after the arrest
of a man who allegedly helped run Silk Road 2.0, a large online trading
post on the dark web whose visitors often use Tor to access the site. At
the time, some speculated that his arrest was tied to the attack against
Tor in the first half of 2014.
Most recently, in mid-November, Tor accused CMU of accepting payment and
assisting the FBI — in ways that indicate a warrant was not involved —
to “attack hidden services users in a broad sweep, and then sift through
their data to find people.” These allegations are hugely problematic for
CERT/CC. As an entity that espouses  to be
“a trusted, authoritative organization dedicated to improving the
security of computer systems and networks,” finding and not disclosing
vulnerabilities is a good way to undermine that trust. Exploiting those
vulnerabilities is even worse.
But let’s take a step back for a moment. Why, beyond the obvious privacy
concerns raised by Tor, is this such a big deal?
CERT/CC, and indeed the Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT)
community as a whole
is a pillar of global cybersecurity. (CSIRT is another term often used
to describe the type of organization CERT/CC is.) Generally, CSIRTs are
responsible for receiving, reviewing, and responding to computer
security incident reports from a set of clients, which can include
government agencies, private companies, security researchers, and
ordinary Internet users.
Since the late 1980s, CERT/CC, as the name suggests, has been a major
coordination center for global CSIRT activities. As as result, it has
access to a wide array of incident information and vulnerabilities,
which could, hypothetically, be used to help crack Tor’s anonymity
feature. In addition, the organization — initially funded as a DARPA
project and still funded  with federal money —
is largely transnational in nature and serves as the secretariat for
national CSIRTs, more than 100 of which are distributed across the globe.
CSIRTs are increasingly referenced in international discussions as a key
component in efforts to build global capacity to combat cybersecurity
threats and develop norms of behavior among nations in the cyber realm.
For example, the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on
cybersecurity suggested
 this summer
that special teams authorized to respond to cybersecurity incidents,
such as CSIRTs, should not be used to “engage in malicious international
activity” and should not be the target of attacks. If CSIRTs are to be
held out as off limits, they need to be impartial (like, say, the Red
Cross ) and cannot be
political actors, lest they become legitimate targets.
CERT/CC, and many other CSIRTs around the world, collect information
that can be very useful for both identifying and capturing criminals.
They rely heavily
on the trust incident reporters and vulnerability researchers have in
the CSIRTs, trust that is garnered after developing close ties with the
constituencies they serve. When a CSIRT is discovered, or even rumored,
to be acting in a way that is negligent or undermines network security
of perfectly legal services, this bond of trust is fractured. Less trust
means less information for CSIRTs.
To pour salt on the wound, the controversy around the latest story
undermines the effectiveness of CERT/CC both to carry out its own duties
and to assist the FBI in the future. Though it is often not explicit in
documentation, a relationship between CSIRTs and law enforcement
agencies is often assumed. Indeed, such cooperation can be helpful for
both law enforcement and CSIRTs. Law enforcement can obtain important
technical information about incidents from CSIRTs, which in turn helps
law enforcement identify and pursue cyber-criminals. On the flipside,
some industries (particularly in the US) have close relationships with
law enforcement that result in law enforcement becoming an important
reporter of incidents to the CSIRT. But if these two types of bodies are
to have close working relationships, they should follow explicit and
transparent guidelines in accordance with due process. If the FBI is
engaging with CSIRTs to essentially break a feature of Internet security
en masse, it is making its own life more difficult down the line by
removing the legitimacy of a key ally in cyber criminal investigations.
To be clear: This is not an indictment of CSIRTs working with law
enforcement. As I explain in detail with my colleagues Isabel Skierka,
Mirko Hohmann, and Tim Maurer in our recent report
cooperation between CSIRTs and law enforcement is not necessarily a bad
thing. A comprehensive approach to addressing cybercrime would ideally
meld the technical expertise and access CSIRTs have painstakingly
developed with traditional law enforcement expertise found in agencies
like the FBI. In fact, many national-level CSIRTs actually sit within
law enforcement, intelligence, or national security organizations or
have formal liaisons with those agencies.
Indeed, most in the CSIRT community seem ready to accept that CSIRTs
have reached a point in their maturity where a formal, transparent
relationship with law enforcement is practicable. This is because the
quandary facing CSIRTs is one that has pervaded the American
intelligence community for decades: Some activities simply do not pass
the front-page test; meaning that some actions, when they come to light,
will hurt the reputation of the organization. As New America
Cybersecurity Fellow and Georgia Tech professor Peter Swire wrote
earlier this year
the half-life of secrets is diminishing, and interactions like CERT/CC’s
with the FBI are likely to become known much sooner than they would in
the past. For the CSIRT community, which relies so heavily on trust for
effectiveness, keeping their relationships with the government secret
will be both extremely difficult and may undermine their reputations
once they come to light.
The news of CMU’s possible assistance in compromising Tor’s most
critical feature, anonymity, presents an opportunity for many to attack
the integrity of CERT/CC and the researchers at the Software Engineering
Institute. Bruce Schneier
and others
have been quick to point out that this incident has erased (or at least
greatly diminished) CERT/CC’s hard-earned reputation as an honest
broker. It is certain to be a warning to other CSIRTs around the world
that they should transparently define their relationships with law
enforcement agencies.
Regardless of how fault should be apportioned in this particular
instance, the news comes as part of a larger trend in the CSIRT
community. Once relatively apolitical, these technical teams are
undergoing a process of politicization. National level CSIRTs, many of
which once resided outside of government in academic institutions and
non-governmental organizations, are being pulled into government
structures. At the same time, their relationships with law enforcement
agencies are becoming closer and (to those outside of the agencies) more
What can be done to protect the credibility and neutrality of these
important pillars in the network security ecosystem? The recommendations
we outline in our report provide a roadmap:
  * The first step to protect trust in these teams is to reverse the
    recent trend and /not/ place them under the control of law
    enforcement and intelligence agencies. Such agencies are
    incentivized to use the tools at their disposal to investigate
    crime, collect intelligence, and pursue threat groups, and thus will
    often disregard the apolitical information coordination role CSIRTs
    play.
  * Second, CSIRTs and law enforcement must more transparently define
    the terms of their cooperation, including how and under what
    circumstances they interact. They should also clearly define what
    kinds of information and expertise are exchanged and what
    direction(s) shared information flows.
  * Third, for CSIRTs to remain trusted brokers, they must clarify their
    mandates and missions. Traditionally, a CSIRT has placed remediating
    damage from incidents and returning systems to operation as top
    priorities. Is this still the case, or is CSIRT expertise being
    poured into combating cybercrime and assisting law enforcement
    agencies in developing tools and methods to discover criminals?
Finally, though not included in our recommendations in the report, to
recover the trust it has recently lost, CERT/CC’s mission and role needs
to be clearly defined by the organization itself, its funders, its
partners, and its constituency. Is it essentially a second US national
CSIRT alongside the Department of Homeland Security’s US-CERT
, or is it something closer to a private CSIRT
that plays a role in maintaining global cybersecurity? If it is a
global, non-government CSIRT, transparently defining its relationship
with law enforcement, intelligence, and other political actors — both
inside and outside the US — is all the more important.
In the end, the actions of the computer security professionals at
CERT/CC who allegedly aided the FBI are somewhat understandable. Their
overarching goal is to secure computer systems. The traditional CSIRT
approach focuses on technical identification and remediation of
incidents, in addition to promoting technical measures to protect
systems from attacks in the first place. The goal of law enforcement
bodies in cybersecurity is to lend a helping hand in preventing attacks
from taking place by rounding up the likely and past perpetrators. That
aligns with the CSIRT community’s goal. But the allegations of the
researchers’ work (the cybersecurity applicability of which is dubious
at best) to crack Tor demonstrate the damage that can be done when when
a CSIRT’s interaction with law enforcement is not openly and strictly
The controversy surrounding this story represents something much larger
than the alleged incident. CSIRTs are meant to be apolitical actors
concentrating on computer and network security. The ramifications of
politicization and muddied mandates could permeate up to states’ efforts
to develop international norms of behavior in cyberspace, like those
by the UN Group of Governmental Experts, that rely on the integrity and
independence of global CSIRTs. By undermining these norms before they
take root, the FBI, and by extension the US government, undermine their
own efforts to promote an open and secure cyberspace through norms for
responsible state behavior.

of 'firewall' between it and the car control circuitry was similar to
the problem that caused a China-base Mattel contractor to send
lead-painted toys to be included in (was it BK?) 'happy meals' for kids.
The problem? What the toy was going to be used for simply wasn't
mentioned in the specs delivered to the contractor so they never took it
into consideration to use a non-toxic coating. In this case it looks
like the in-car entertainment system manufacturer simply wasn't aware of
the rest of the circuitry in the vehicle, and it wasn't mentioned by
Chrysler, so they never even thought about it.

it’s very unlikely that the attack will go unnoticed. So the targeting of security companies

care much if they are discovered and exposed. By targeting Kaspersky Lab, the Duqu

Military Blimp’s Rampage Deflates Raytheon’s Hopes to Sell More
In what may be the most bizarre and public crash of a multi-billion
dollar Pentagon boondoggle ever, a surveillance blimp flying over an
Army base in Maryland broke loose Wednesday afternoon, its 6,000-foot
long tether wreaking havoc on the countryside before it finally came
down in pieces in Pennsylvania.
The giant airship — 80 yards long and about the size of three Goodyear
blimps — was one of a pair that represented the last gasp of an 18-year,
$2.7 billion-dollar program called JLENS or “Joint Land Attack Cruise
Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System.”
There were once supposed to be 36 of them, their high-resolution
360-degree radar coverage up to 340 miles in any direction protecting
the nation from cruise missiles.
But costs inflated, doubts about their utility mounted, and the program
was scaled back and almost killed.
Blimps, it turns out, have had mixed success in purely military terms.
When equipped with cameras, they are highly effective at conducting
surveillance – but the Army promised there were no cameras on the JLENS
What blimps are best at is having a psychological effect: making people
feel like they’re being watched. Filmmaker Kirsten Johnson’s short
documentary The Above touches on that phenomenon. The film, made for The
Intercept‘s Field of Vision project, mostly shows a U.S. military
surveillance balloon floating on a tether high above Kabul, Afghanistan.
But it ends with shots of the JLENS.
Finally, the Army agreed to launch two of them, for a three-year test.
They were hovering at a height of 10,000 feet just off Interstate 95,
about 45 miles northeast of Washington, D.C., and about 20 miles from
Baltimore. In theory, they could track moving objects from North
Carolina to Boston, or an area the size of Texas. With only two in the
air, they effectively cost about $1.4 billion each — a lot, even by
advanced weapons standards.
While the blimps became perhaps the Pentagon’s most visible white
elephants, their manufacturer, the Raytheon Co., still hoped to make
some more money off them.
The huge defense contractor’s endgame, at least until Wednesday, seemed
to be trying to sell them abroad.
In a video interview with Shephard Media just two weeks ago, Douglas
Burgess, director of persistent surveillance programs at Raytheon,
discussed the JLENS program. “There’s a lot of interest internationally,
particularly now that we’re up and flying,” he said. “I can’t talk
specifics about who, but there is certainly a lot of interest
As for his next step? “For us, it’s to get the A+, I call it, on the
scorecard from NORAD about its operational utility here on the East
Coast. So that’s really our near-term focus.”
But that A+ has now most likely turned into something closer to an F.
Then again, JLENS has cheated death before. After a JLENS blimp was
destroyed in a storm in September of 2010, Army officials raised doubts
about the program, attempting to scale it back. That set in motion an
aggressive effort by Raytheon to win over support from Capitol Hill and
the Pentagon.
Raytheon retained the lobbying services of former Sens. John Breaux,
D-La., and Trent Lott, R-Miss., through the firm now known as Squire
Patton Boggs, to press lawmakers on the urgency of the program. TCOM, a
subcontractor for the project, also brought on lobbyists to boost the
blimp, including American Defense International, a D.C. consulting firm.
The company’s officials argued that the JLENS could be used “not just in
combat, but also American cities and towns” as a surveillance tool for
tracking small planes and other domestic threats, according to an
investigation by the Los Angeles Times.
Raytheon, which sponsors regular advertisements in the Beltway Metro
system and is a prominent sponsor of think tanks across the city,
launched a series of promotional videos. Make sure you have the sound up
for this one:
The savior of the JLENS program, according to the Times, was Marine
Corps Gen. James E. “Hoss” Cartwright, then vice chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff. Cartwright argued within the ranks of the military that
the blimp had broad use, despite claims by many that the blimps would
not be much use against the type of crude weapons, such as IEDs, used
against troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Cartwright, after securing support for the blimp, joined Raytheon’s
board, a position that has paid him more than $828,000 in cash and stock.
Among the promotional material Raytheon prepared for JLENS was a FAQ.
One of the questions was “Can the tether break?”
The Raytheon answer: “The chance of that happening is very small because
the tether is made of Vectran and has withstood storms in excess of 100
knots. However, in the unlikely event it does happen, there are a number
of procedures and systems in place which are designed to bring the
aerostat down in a safe manner.”

    Over the last few years there have been numerous reports of ISPs
    that alter or proxy their customers’ traffic, including, for
    example, CMA Communications in 2013 [6], Comcast in 2012 [16],
    Mediacom in 2011 [9], WOW! in 2008 [27], and Rogers in 2007 [32].
    Moreover, several extensive studies have brought the details of this
    practice to light [17, 30, 25, 35]. The main motivations of ISPs to
    alter traffic are to facilitate caching, inject advertisements into
    DNS and HTTP error messages, and compress or transcode content.
     All of these reports and studies found that these traffic
    alterations were carried out exclusively by edge ISPs,namely, retail
    ISPs that sell Internet access directly to end customers, and are
    their “first hop” to the Internet. This finding stems from the
    server-centric approach the above studies have taken. In this
    approach, one or a handful of servers are deployed to deliver
    specific content to users, after which a large number of clients are
    solicited to fetch that content from the servers. Finally, an agent
    on the clients – usually a JavaScript delivered by the server itself
    – looks for deviations between the content delivered by the server
    and that displayed to the user. Figure 1(a)illustrates the traffic
    monitored in this server-centric approach.
    Such an approach can be used to inspect the traffic of many clients
    from diverse geographies who are served by different edge ISPs. The
    main disadvantage of this approach is that the content fetched by
    the clients is very specific. All clients fetch the same content
    from the same web servers. This allows only the detection of network
    entities that aim to modify all of the Internet traffic1 of a
    predetermined set of users and are generally oblivious to the actual
    content delivered to the user. Such entities indeed tend to be edge
    ISPs that target only the traffic of their customers.
    In this work we show that the above approach misses a substantial
    portion of the on-path entities that modify traffic on the Internet.
    Using extensive observations over a period of several weeks, we
    analyzed petabits of Internet traffic carrying varied content
    delivered by servers having over 1.5 million distinct IP addresses.
    We newly reveal several network operators that modify traffic not
    limited to a specific set of users. Such network operators alter
    Internet traffic on the basis of its content, primarily by the
    website a user visits. The traffic of every Internet user that
    traverses these network operators is susceptible to alteration."

I would take an un-educted guess that this WAS the purpose of the
attack. Shutting the rest of the world's service off and isolating North
America as a practice drill.
Ps. North Korea successfully detonated a Hydrogen Bomb yesterday.

instance, you could look at the US as being largely based on free-speech-anarchism, as per the First Amendment.  Based on that, and
perhaps borrowing from the Second, Fourth Amendments and other sources, you could easily justify an effort like cypherpunks.  In the
90's, Cypherpunks, individually and as a whole, were super important to avoid things going the wrong way in the US.  It was
important for clear-headed arguments to be made, legal and other challenges mounted in just the right way, and education and code
spread widely and evolved quickly.  Paranoid babble would not have helped, and is still not helping.
Understanding the "establishment" doesn't mean being "their" bot.  Your lack of understanding and/or irrational distrust doesn't
make you an anarchist; it shows your ignorance.
"You don't know your own argument unless you know your opponent's." - anon (I think.)  You can't even understand who your opponent
is unless you understand all sides as much as possible.
Quite a weak and lazy response; you obviously have nothing but bluster.  If you can't back up your statements with evidence, you
aren't really saying anything useful.  Plonk.
I think I've probably been "here" much longer than you have.  I was learning and participating since fairly early, and continuously
for quite a few years.  For instance:

"Tor is criminal garbage created by the pentagon to serve their ends."
Sorry he's a troll, and as I've claimed repeatedly he's simply fishing
for info to catalog responses. His irrational extremism gives him away.
He's looking for extremists to stalk by acting like one.
Just because he can make some sort of argument to support a position
doesn't mean he isn't a federal troll doing socio-psychlogical
profiling. Most of his shorter posts could be written by an AI robot.

That's the best you can ever hope for. Use the time wisely.
