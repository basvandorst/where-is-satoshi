To which tcmay responded:
AFAIK (my 4 lines might differ from yours), there is no PRNG in the
4 lines of perl. The key is supplied as a parameter, and no guidance
to its generation is given in the implementation.
You are right about the dc, but it only uses that for modular exponentiation,
which is a lot easier to prove correct than PRNG.
Which is not to say that it *has* been proven.
I guess that makes me a nit-picker...

Hello Michael Froomkin   and Rich Salz   and cypherpunks at toad.com
Original reason at end (after the reply).
Protection from spoofing.
Certification is needed to avoid another person intercepting, re-signing,
and substituting hir own key.
Certification is needed to avoid another person diverting the ecash
(a disputed unsigned key practically useless). In fact a much simpler
attack is denial-of-service: simply dispute the key (send another one
to the keyservers), and let the resulting uncertainty cut off the profits.
Also, if you insist on govt-is-root, you need certified pseudonyms
to set up a pseudonymous CA (ie a CA whose real identity is unknown).

There's no reason for the recipient to know it's from your credit card.
You simply obtain cash from your bank as a loan and then give it to
the recipient.
If you want to provide the convenience of CC (ie avoid having to go to
the ATM first), you could allow wallets to communicate with the bank
via the merchant's equipment, in effect building an ATM into every point-of-sale terminal.
wallet via merchant to bank: withdraw X from account Y
bank via merchant to wallet: here is X in e-cash
wallet to merchant: here is X in e-cash
If you do not wish the bank to know which merchant it was, you could send
it via an anonymizing service or two.
Well, same as in any other system: "how much are you willing to give me
for this?"

Hello don at cs.byu.edu

Wouldn't it be possible to reduce the cost?
Each client could pick a segment at random, check it and then broadcast
a NAK. Other clients would then know that the segment in question has
been done, and avoid picking it in the future. If you are worried about
collisions, one could also have IGRAB, which would advise others that
someone is working on a segment (you can still collide, but not so
One advantage is that it is not necessary to have a central infinitely
trusted server. (Nothing personal, but bogus server is an attack.)
NAKs and IGRABs would be weighted by the trust accorded to the entity
that originated them.
  * "broadcast" is probably best done with a fairly sparse graph, otherwise
one will get too much communications.
  * since there is no "server", I should replace "client" with another word.
  * there is no incentive to send NAKs (they diminish your own chance
of hitting the jackpot). How could this be avoided?
  * the NAKs could be sent by e-mail, thus allowing badly connected
and/or anonymous entities to participate.
Am I making any sense at all?

The problem will be that a superuser can do just about anything...
Well, what's wrong with   pgp -f | /bin/sh
? Obviously, it still decrypts before use, and may or may not be
useful depending on your application, but it never has a file with
the unencrypted script around.
It depends on what you want to prevent: copying the scripts, running them, understanding them, or what?
To prevent copying/running them, you can use the above script, but
you'll have to type in the passphrase each time (checking that noone
is watching you, which is impossible with a determined su).
If you just want them to not understand, obfuscation should suffice.
(But reverse-engineering can still be applied.)
(On the "supply useless source" subthread, it is possible to define
the term "source code" so as to disallow such obfuscation. See the
GNU GPL ("copyleft") licence for an example.)

Hello fc at all.net (Dr. Frederick B. Cohen)
  and mab at crypto.com (Matt Blaze)
  and cypherpunks at toad.com
I'm afraid I missed the start of this thread, sorry if I'm repeating...
The problem is that "secure" is not really something that can be proved.
(I'm not sure if that's a theoretical or a practical fact, but it remains.)
For one thing, I'm not even sure the RSA algorithm itself is secure.
(At least I've never heard of a proof; have you?)
As long as I'm using PGP to send letters to grandma, the cost (to me) of
a successful attack is small. I therefore expend little effort to verify
that it is secure.
If/when I start to use it for more serious applications, I will read the source code. I might even modify it (eg. accord less entropy per
keystroke) if I'm not happy with it.
If circumstances warranted, I could re-implement it from the appropriate
RFC (is it out yet or still draft?). However, in such circumstances,
I very much suspect a one-time-pad would be used.
I do not believe that it can be proven secure.
If you doubt the key-gen routine:
  * you are certainly free to make up your own keys any way you like,
  * write your own and argue that it's better, and/or
  * find a way to break the key-gen routine.
Adding to the list:
  * I've never heard of anyone catching anything (except the headers on
clearsigned messages problem).
The security of anything is an open question.
You shouldn't spend more on proving security than a breach would cost.

Hello cypherpunks at toad.com
  and tcmay at got.net (Timothy C. May)
I've read somewhere that it's possible to play poker over the telephone;
see comp.risks 17.19 and 17.21 (particularly the latter, though I haven't
followed the references so I can't speak of them).
How about every person commits a random number, then all reveal.
The winner is determined deterministically from all the numbers.
Does this make sense or is there some basic hole in it?
I have a tendency to be too brief to be comprehensible, so let me
rephrase it somewhat longer:
1. game is announced, players registered and numbered [1]..[n]
2. each player [i] chooses a random number [a_i] (secretly)
3. each player [i] publicly commits to [a_i]
4. wait for all players to commit
5. each player [i] publishes [a_i]
6. the winner is player [f(a_1,a_2,...,a_n)]
The function f doesn't need to be one way, but the output must depend on
all the inputs. (Sum modulo n sounds OK but I haven't thought it out.)
The fun bit in this game would be picking your number - of course
that reduces security, but I suspect that many people would prefer
to type in their lucky numbers themselves than having a computer
pick it for them... Or you could get the entropy from the mouse:
"it's all in the wrist".
You could probably almost code that in a shell script...
Obvious weakness is that the last player to do step 5 above knows
who the winner is before anyone else, and could presumably disappear.
The way to avoid this is a rule that when a player disappears the
money goes to charity. (A malicious last player could still prevent
you from winning, but at least without payoff. You could give it
negative payoff if you wanted.) If you wish to discuss this point,

If Alice is afraid of loss of identity (as if he had one now),
he could have a permanent key at home (where he does his OTP work),
and on his e-mail machine have only a temporary key. When the key
on the public machine is compromised, it is revoked and a new one
is issued.

Actually, you don't - you just don't get signatures without it.
However, authentication AFAIK was never a problem to export,
so there's no need to bother.
If you are reading a signed message, you simply strip off the
signature without checking it (or you leave it on and pass it
through a hypothetical exportable auth-only PGP).
For creating messages, you have to make do without signatures.

An earthquake 3.6 on the Richter scale would be no problem if you are
playing poker, say, but "catastrophic" if you are playing mikado.
It also depends on the "Operating System" (building) you are in.
I wouldn't exactly say Soyuz failed; I'd say the main problem was that
they got a leader with a conscience... And you can't have a totalitarian
dictator with a conscience (as you can see).
I would suspect the best answer is "to the general public" or "to the
average user".
If you are not an average user, you reinterpret the rankings to your
liking, making sure that you get more information on those that are
potentially severe to you. It'll still help you by giving you a preliminary ranking.
No, that is not necessary. Just like you can say an earthquake measures
3.6 on the Richter scale without making any statements about whether
or not it is "severe".
Not really, you don't need to change the Richter scale just because
buildings have got more solid. The perception of the scale needs to
change, but not the scale itself.
Then you are asking not for a rating of individual bugs, but overall
bugginess of a product. That can be rated on the same scale or a different
one, but it is a different question.

Even for a picture (as opposed to text fax) you have correlation.

@_subject: Anonymity: A Modest Proposal 
(replying to Eli Brandt )
Not really. Wouldn't there be a different politic to reassembling
messages as opposed to anonymous remailing?
Such a reassembly server could cooperate with the authorities, nay, even
precede each message with a PGP-signed list of where the various pieces
came from. On second thoughts that last is a bad idea (because
you might want the first line to be eg a reply block), but such a list
could be published on WWW by Message-ID (or Subject, or ...).
The remailers thus implicated have the defence that they could not possibly
have known the contents of the message, because it was split.
Actually, the same end can be achieved by having a non-anonymous remailer,
which simply decrypts and mails - and cooperates with the authorities.
It doesn't even need to strip the headers. However, such a thing would
probably have no other function than this so it might be harder to run.
(A reassembly server would have the stated function of implementing
k-of-n splits, eg for key/document escrow etc. Pieces coming in anonymously
would be merely permitted, not expected.)
I understand that a post of mine on Cypherpunks had certain piece
of CoS scripture added to it. The original post was signed, and the
person or persons responsible did not attempt to include the
addition within the signed part (merely attached it to the end) so
the signature still checked out.
Even on cypherpunks somebody replied to that addition with the
attribution "Jiri Baum wrote" without noting it wasn't signed by me.
(Called it "drivil", too, but I guess that's between him, his English teacher and the CoS.)
"Richard Martin"  replied to s.:
Well, I sign everything, don't I? (Somebody please tell me if I don't.)
No I don't have it hard-coded into my mailer. However it's easy enough
to do as it is:

As for no-good proto-coins, it's Bob's fault, isn't it? Alice has a record of what Bob sent, and what she sent back. Anybody can check
that the latter is a bank-signed version of the former. Given this,
there's no need (from this) for Alice to know that the proto-coins are

Hello cypherpunks at toad.com
  and Scott Brickner Well, I don't know lojban, but I've had a glance at it...
.u'u I believe that you were wrong when you expressed a symbol for the
list of forms of structure words. There are also words of the form V'V.
On the other hand, however, not all letter combinations are permitted;
eg there are only fourteen dipthongs (of which only four are "normal").
Yeah, and a huge beast it is. If you can make a YACCable language with
one page of rules (say 16 :-) ), *then* I'll be impressed.
Would you believe two grammars for mathematical expressions? No? Good!
There are three (infix, prefix and postfix).
You have to be careful here - the structure words (cmavo) are divided
into groups (selma'o) which have different gramatical functions.
You can't mix up members of different selma'o (in general), so you'd
have to permute within each separately.
Some of these selma'o have very few members (even just one) and/or
may of themselves reveal information.
Yes, but the grammatical structure itself may reveal heaps.
(Except for trivial statements.)
Yup, including font changes, if memory serves!
Not really; you just need to make sure that you conjugate the coded words.
(Ie substitute nouns for nouns, verbs for verbs, etc.)
In Esperanto, the normal words roots (those that need an ending) would
be easy enough to permute... For the rest, you'd have to be careful about
structure words like "cxu" (which turns the sentence into a question),
conjunctions etc which go at specific places of the sentence.
There's plenty enough prepositions to permute :-)
You can probably make do with 1000-2000 words in Esperanto, making
the codebook somewhat more manageable than in other languages.
On the other hand, you would probably have to be careful to delineate
the boundaries, as confusion could result (the breaking up of an E-a
word into the component roots is not necessarily unique, leading to puns
ranging from beautiful (diamanto) through the weird (amoro) to the horrible).
Perhaps that would be a feature, though?

Hello cypherpunks at toad.com
  and Scott Brickner No worse than fake NAKs to the central server (viz comment below).
An attack on the attempt. If the key owner also volunteers a server,
then half the CPU cycles will report to that server (and be given
useless chunks of keyspace) thus halving the CPU power available to
the usual server ("half" in an infinitely naive world, of course).
The approach I suggested basically corresponds to everyone maintaining
hir own server; servers that trust each other will coordinate.
An attacker can of course NAK the key segment, but only those that trust
the attacker will take any notice.
The difference is that in this scheme everyone does coordinate, only
it's peer-peer rather than client-server.
I think that's where it came from. I really should provide citations,
shouldn't I...
Similarly in the peer-peer approach, the effort is coordinated but
untrusted NAKs slow it down only slightly. The only "solicited" NAKs
will be your own.

Hello Bill Stewart   and cypherpunks at toad.com, "Jeff Weinstein"   and Christian Wettergren ... [the referenced section elided by jirib] ...
If I only ever give out a hash of my seed, and only ever *add* any received
info to my seed (and stir it in well), how can anyone find out anything?
(Apart from hash weaknesses.)
The only thing that remains is that I cannot really count on a stranger
to actually give me something truly random. In fact, since at least
one other person knows it, I shouldn't count any entropy from it at all.
However, if I get e bits from each of n servers, and k of them are rogue,
then I have e*(n-k) bits, ie e*n*(1-k/n). With a suitably conservative
estimate of k/n, this should be acceptable.
In any case, accepting donations of entropy cannot possibly reduce the
amount of entropy I have, can it?
As well as the normal servers, there might be dedicated randomness servers
whose sole purpose is to give you a random number. For a toy example, see
  (where ToyRandValue should be replaced by whatever your random value is).
Again, one would connect to several and stir the results together,
confident in the statistics that say at least one is genuine.
Of course, we then have a chicken-and-egg problem of getting secure
connection to the randomness servers, but we have that anyway. Perhaps each
client could keep a pool of randomness, and whenever it runs low connect
to the randomness servers to re-fill, initially using "type random text".
I'm not sure I follow this one. Why?
If the neighbour is willing to trust me for more, and cannot possibly
deduce my seed from the numbers ('cause it's a strong 1-way hash),
the only thing it costs me is CPU time - it'd cost me more to keep
track of who asked for how much when.
Then again, you can always ping. With a well-chosen target, you get
10 bits raw from the first packet... Perhaps about 7 or 8 of actual
usable entropy (and before you flame me, ping melb.dialix.oz.au).
Part of this is that once the sources of randomness are sufficiently
diverse, it's just easier for an attacker to modify your s/w.
Especially if you never throw out your seed, so that all your interactions
since the beginning are unfathomably stirred into your current key.
(Ie I might not mind if I have only 1 bit of entropy per transaction
provided that the total entropy is 128 bits. Provided I never reveal
my seed, of course. This would mean that the value risked on any
particular 128 bits are 128 of my transactions, not just one, but for
most people each of those transactions will involve the same CC number
so it makes no difference anyway.)
Hope that makes sense...

Which both seem to be true to me (they are *not* contradictory, only
the consequences are).
How about this idea: I remember once seeing some piece on some TV
personality (sorry, don't remember who, long time ago) who was
interviewed by fax. The jounalist sent questions to him, and some
time later received answers.
All that is needed then is someone with a fax machine to volunteer
to receive the fax, type it in and summarise the response afterwards
(noting points on which there was disagreement, and who disagreed
in what way).
Except PGP skill doesn't equal PR skill, not to mention that there
might be a geographical, time-zone or language barrier.
Sometimes having a separate PR person is useful, even if it does
tend to lead to the moronic statements salesdroids are infamous for.
With care, this problem can be minimized.
Not all PGP is done in those areas. You might want to have a SpokesPunk
near a focus to avoid having to get the people who actually do the work

It's in our interest to give them such catchy quotes, no?
Unless it would destroy us, of course...
Only problem is, does anyone know of any other way to get our

But then wouldn't that journalist act as a SpokesPunk?
Would you support such a jounalist writing about Cypherpunks?
What is the essential difference between a jounalist writing an

A well-written press release could reflect that.
For example, some points could be presented in two ways (perhaps
even contradictory) with full attribution of who wrote which view.
Those who oppose the whole idea could be noted in the press release :-)
Unless they object to that in which case they wouldn't be.

I don't think that's what was intended. If I understood:
There'd be a document (hereinafter PoA) signed by Helen which would

that every document has "p.p. Helen" at the end. The recipient checks
Dave's signature on the document and Helen's signature on the PoA.
Many automatic systems will assume that a key can only sign for one person (though each person may have several keys). Therefore,
it'll confuse "Dave" and "pp. Helen". The RISKS are obvious.
To avoid such confusion, Dave should create a separate key with the key ID "Dave pp. Helen" (or similar). However, Helen doesn't need
to (shouldn't) know that key! This is Dave's key, created by Dave
for Dave's use while he is agent for Helen. Helen would probably
sign this key, but doesn't need to since the PoA has the f'print.
In fact, you don't want Helen to know it, so that if Dave oversteps
his authority she can prove that it was him not her. Ie if Helen finds
out the key, Dave should revoke it.

@_subject: What to do about Germany 
Hello "Michael C. Peponis"   and cypherpunks at toad.com
...[in reply to someone Re: Compu$erve vs Germany]...
What if the laws actually contradict each other?
Eg if there was a country that forbade women speaking on the net, and
another that forbade distinctions between men and women to be made?
(Sorry about the example, ladies, but it's one that comes to mind...)
I guess at that stage one or the other of the countries will cut itself
off the net.
BTW, in the January 96 *Australian Personal Computer*, an opinion
column draws a comparison between the attitude to the Internet and
the (ancient) obligation for a motor car to be preceeded by someone
carrying a red flag... Not such a bad metaphor, I thought.

...[About exploding phones]...
This isn't really news...
Haven't you ever heard of the ASCII control character EOU?
Quoting from the Jargon file:
:EOU: /E-O-U/ n. The mnemonic of a mythical ASCII control
   character (End Of User) that would make an ASR-33 Teletype explode
   on receipt.  This construction parodies the numerous obscure
   delimiter and control characters left in ASCII from the days when
   it was associated more with wire-service teletypes than computers
   (e.g., FS, GS, RS, US, EM, SUB, ETX, and esp. EOT).  It is worth
   remembering that ASR-33s were big, noisy mechanical beasts with a
   lot of clattering parts; the notion that one might explode was
   nowhere near as ridiculous as it might seem to someone sitting in
   front of a {tube} or flatscreen today.
This isn't worth signing and I'm tired...

@_subject: A couple of ideas for PGP-based programs 
Hello cypherpunks at toad.com
  and Alan Olsen Probably a good idea (that, and/or have a mailing list with key revocations).
How about it, keys.pgp.net people?
This is very easy, at least in Unix: pgp -kvv, grep, cut, for.
In DOS, you can do pgp -kvv and find, then edlin to change
every "sig" into "call getkey", call the resulting (batch) file,
which will call GETKEY.BAT for every missing key. I hope.
However, I don't see much of a point to it: these are people you don't
even know the keys of; how are you going to know whether they are
trustworthy? (The Web-o-Trust can only tell you who they are, not
whether to trust them.)
No, you wouldn't. You would tend to have the keys that sign a lot
of other keys, which would include both SLED (Four-11) and a lot
of careless people that sign every key in sight.
How about, instead:
3) A way to retrieve all the keys signed by a given entity.
This would have the effect that when you come to trust Alice, you
can simply go and get all the keys she signed. I believe the present
keyservers don't allow that... (Or else I don't know how to ask for it.)
Hope that makes sense...

@_subject: A weakness in PGP signatures, and a suggested solution (long) 
Hello ckey2 at eng.ua.edu (Christopher R. Key)
  and cypherpunks at toad.com
Somebody already pointed out an adult message being re-posted to a kidgroup.
But then the recipient has a PGP-signed message from you which
isn't encrypted (using pgp -d). That person could then impersonate
you. Eg Alice the jilted lover could resend the goodbye message
with forged headers to Bob's new girlfriend to get back at him.
What a sentence. Here it is again, hopefully understandable:
  From:Bob; Encrypted(Signed("We're through",Bob),Alice)
Alice does pgp -d, leaving her with Signed("We're through",Bob)
  From:Bob; Encrypted(Signed("We're through",Bob),Carol)
Later, when Bob gets another girlfriend,
  From:Bob; Encrypted(Signed("We're through",Bob),Danielle)
Later still,
  From:Bob; Encrypted(Signed("We're through",Bob),Eve)

@_subject: Hack Lotus? 
Hello cypherpunks at toad.com
  and daw at beijing.CS.Berkeley.EDU (David A Wagner)
I have no idea how Lotus actually does this, but:
How about a salt determined by the forty bit part?
Ie if the key is s.g (s=secret, g=gaked), the BARF (="Big-brother Access
Required Field") could contain Encrypt(Hash(s).g,BigBrother).
The receiving end, knowing both s and g, could re-calculate the
BARF and only function when it's correct. Unless it's been hacked too,
in which case it could barf when the BARF is correct :-)
Would that work or have I missed something? As I said, I've no idea
what Lotus actually does.

Hello "david d `zoo' zuhn"   and wendigo at pobox.com (Mark Rogaski), cypherpunks at toad.com
Not so easy - as somebody pointed out in another thread, this will be very easy to brute - only 2^24 cleartexts to try...
You have to put in some salt to prevent this.
If you want the recipient to be able to check that the key is correctly
there, you need to make the salt known to both (eg a 1-way hash of the whole key). You might want to do this to make the program refuse
to interoperate with hacked versions.
I suppose it'll be safe for a while yet (esp. for session keys), but
has anyone multiplied that graphics-workstation-40bit price by 2^24?
It's only 10 billion! (billion=10^9) A lot of money, sure, but given
that it's not very expensive to go to 128 bits or more, why ???
(Please, do NOT post c*nspiracy theories --- they are obvious to everyone
and therefore unpatentable.)
Now how about the percentage of *foreign* people who trust the US govt.?
Given that it has said that it'll spy commercially... (if memory serves).
Hope I'm making sense... (well, they say "hope dies last"...)

Hello Tom Johnston   and Bill Stewart   and cypherpunks at toad.com
This is not that difficult for MS to work around - for example, they
could modify the code harmlessly before signing it. Unless you
know *how* they modified it, you can't reproduce it.
Example: some assembly instructions have more than one machine
code representation. MS could put some kind of cryptographically
strong pattern into these (ie one that can't be reverse-engineered).

Eeek! that gives 2^24 possible plaintext/ciphertext pairs. Trivial to brute.
3 should be:
  extracts 24 bits of K and concatenates it with H(K) to make K'
  where H is a strong one-way hash. Hope that makes sense...

@_subject: FV Demonstrates Fatal Flaw in Software Encryption of Credit Cards 
Hello Nathaniel Borenstein   and cypherpunks at toad.com, Peter Monta And in a later post:
So, what's wrong with the virus listening through the audio card?
Many people have their phone close to their computer, and credit-card
numbers spoken over the phone are usually spoken clearly.
Presumably mail from FV asking for confirmation wouldn't be too hard
to search for - I guess one would watch WinSock for connection
to the POP port then grab the password etc, followed by periodically checking for new e-mail (without the user's knowledge).
Many people would already have their CC number on the computer somewhere,
in a letter they wrote (and later printed out and posted). If it's a virus,
it doesn't even need a net connection to communicate it back (it can just
remember it and pass it 'home' several infections later).
The real problem ain't the net, but lousy security in home systems.
(Hmm, with the sound cards, couldn't the virus just hypnotise the user....)

Hello dmacfarlane at zip.sbi.com (David Macfarlane), cypherpunks at toad.com
  and packrat at tartarus.uwa.edu.au
        (ie Bruce Murphy )
Original INTERCAL had numbers spelled out in English as input, and
output in butchered roman numerals. I guess you can get people
to do the input (four or eight digits at a time only), but I don't think
the roman numerals are going to cut it, somehow...  and anyway it's
not that much more secure.
C-INTERCAL is less anglo-centric, allowing numbers to be input in
eight languages (eight = ashtan = zortzi = walo = chicue = rva =
malhgwenalh = j"ol). But do you really think people will be willing
to spell their credit-card number in classical Nahuatl for the
sake of security (the *bank's* security)?
If you mean INTERCAL as a programming language, then I guess you
can use the C-INTERCAL binary I/O (character deltas, output reverse),
but then it's no different to any other programming language (except
nobody bothered to implement file and network I/O for it yet so you'd
have to invent it yourself).
Well, how about security through INTERCAL? Would anyone be able to
figure out what an INTERCAL encryption program is doing?
What does the following fragment do?
        PLEASE DON'T GIVE UP
        DO .3 <- !3~
        DO .3 <- !3~
        DO .2 <- !3~
(Hint: it's from the "cat" program, ie copy stdin to stdout verbatim.)
Anyone have a bignum library in the said language?
For the person who was worried about his Linux box, perhaps the virus runs under WINE? (And you *know* how dangerous these viruses
can get when they are drunk :-)
I think I'll put [NOISE] into the subject line...
