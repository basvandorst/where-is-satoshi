@_subject: [tor-talk] possible to identify tor user via hardware DRM? 
We documented, which data, malware inside a VM could collect to identify users. [1] That doesn't mean, we wouldn't be happy about sophisticated, dedicated research. However, here is a summary:
- (Apart from obvious and known, IP, DNS, (browser) fingerprinting.)
- internal LAN IP (of virtualized operating system)
- time zone (of virtualized operating system)
- username (of virtualized operating system)
- hostname (of virtualized operating system)
- mac address of virtual machine
- mac address of host (if using bridged networking) or mac address of gateway (if using virtual internal networking)
- virtual disk uuids
- Some information about the real CPU, depends on VM software. There might be options to further hide information about the CPU.
- Installed software packages.
- If you copy data into the VM: metadata.
