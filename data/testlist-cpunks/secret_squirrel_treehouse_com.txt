comp-privacy at pica.army.mil
   I am the moderator of the Computer Privacy Digest.  The computer
   Privacy Digest is an Internet mailing list that is dedicated to the
   discussion of how technology impacts privacy.  This list is
   into the moderated USENET newsgroup comp.society.privacy.  In lot
   ways it is a subsection on the risks digest but it concentrates on
   the risks of technology on privacy.  The charter is:
   comp.society.privacy    Effects of technology on privacy
   This newsgroup is to provide a forum for discussion on the effect
   technology on privacy. All too often technology is way ahead of the
   law and society as it presents us with new devices and
   applications.  Technology can enhance and detract from privacy.
   This newsgroup will be gatewayed to an internet mailing list.
   Submissions go to: comp-privacy at pica.army.mil and administrative
   requests go to comp-privacy-request at pica.army.mil.

I , Secret Squirrel, am merely cross-posting the above.
I have nothing to do with it, and am in now xxx no way connected
with comp-privacy.  Just thought it might interest someone here.

re: Interface for re-mailer; why not hitch it to emacs or something?
re: problem with key distribution; right, OK, I hadn't thought that
there might be a security problem with casually giving someone your
without them being able to authenticate that it came from you.  Good
Here's my public key.  If you feel it is not secure enough, we can
always use the cone of silence:
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Version: 2.0
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

Anonymity is good.  Anonymity works.
 U> 23l1t34u
 U> -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
Now I feel very unsecure, because the above is all I got. It ain't no
public key...\
Uh... it's kind of an inside joke.  Uh.  Sorry.
Anyway, why would you want to reply only directly to me and not
to the list in general?

Whoah.  That's helarious.  NOT!
Secret Squirrel does not cotton to imposters, and that sure
as hell ain't my Public Key.  So don't even bother trying to
write any encrypted messages with it.
My key remains: 23l1t34u
