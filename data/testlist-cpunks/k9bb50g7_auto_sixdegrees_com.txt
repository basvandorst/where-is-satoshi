Just a quick update from sixdegrees(tm). Unfortunately Larry Gilbert (irving at pobox.com) asked not to be listed as your contact with sixdegrees.
We also wanted to make sure you were aware that you currently have no other confirmed contacts, so it will be hard for you to
have a productive sixdegrees experience. As you probably know, without any confirmed contacts, you won't get any results from our networking searches. So, we just wanted to recommend that you head over to  , log-in, and go to MY CONTACTS to list additional relationships. PLEASE NOTE: All replies to this address are processed by a computer.
If you have any problems, questions or requests send an e-mail to issues at sixdegrees.com and someone will get back to you as soon as
