@_subject: Is VIACrypt PGP authorized for use byPKP? 
I would appreciate some commentary as to whether the VIACRYPT PGP MSDOS
package is licensed for use by PKP (Public Key Partners).
It is my belief that it is.

@_subject: Looking for users of VIACrypt PGP for comments 
I have purchased the VIACRYPT MSDOS package and would value some "DON"T DO THIS"/"DO DO THIS " as i am completely unfamiliar with using V_PGP and
would benefit from the mistakes and learning curves of others.
I would also find it valuable to have some people to contact outside the
c-punks list with the trivial "what"s zis" kind of questions
Thanks fo rthe responses.

CC:	
Subj:	ViaCrypt
I saw your question on the Cypherpunks mail list.  Recently Dave Barnhart, the
ViaCrypt product manager (for Lemcon Systems) became active on Compuserve's Electronic Frontier Forum.  The following is a statement he left in the forums
message section.  He appears more than willing (even eager) to answer questions about ViaCrypt and can be contacted at the addresses given in his   James
      70275.1360 at compuserve.com
ViaCrypt is a division of a 17-year old company named Lemcom Systems.
Lemcom Systems has traditionally produced IBM mainframe communication
controllers and other network products.  About 1989, we began producing a
network product that used DES (That's about the only kind of encryption that
IBM will admit exists).  About 2 years ago, the ViaCrypt division was formed
to develop products incorporating public key cryptography for the PC, UNIX,
and workstation market.  About 1 year ago, ViaCrypt sub-licensed the RSA
patents from Public Key Partners (PKP).  Late last summer (1993), we were
introduced to Phil Zimmermann, author pf PGP.  Phil expressed an interest in
finding a way to commercially market PGP.  Together with our law firm, one
of the coutry's formost experts on intellectual property rights, we examined
the terms of our PKP sub-license to determine if ViaCrypt could market a commercial version of PGP, and if so, under what conditions.  At the same time, we also investigated obtaining a sub-license for the IDEA cipher from Ascom Tech AG in Switzerland.  The opinion was that we could market PGP  1) we substituted ViaCrypt-written RSA code for the existing RSA code in PGP.
 2) we did not supply source code.
So in late September we signed an agreement with Phil Zimmermann to market
the commercial version of PGP, which we chose to call ViaCrypt PGP.  Except
for the RSA routines, a couple of bug-fixes provided by Phil, and a change
in the "welcome banner", the code in ViaCrypt PGP is identical to that found
in PGP 2.3a.  This means that it is interoperable with PGP 2.3a.  Except for
the aforementioned changes, we made no other changes or additions to the PGP 2.3a source to produce ViaCrypt PGP 2.4 for MS-DOS.
Why would you buy ViaCrypt PGP instead of using the 'freeware' PGP?  First,
many small businesses and large corporations have expressed a great deal of
interest in using PGP, but have not done so because of the legal exposure
from RSA.  ViaCrypt PGP removes this problem.  As for the individual, Dr
Hugh Miller said it best on USENET, but I won't quote him here without his
permission.  Essentially, it's your chance to "stand up and be counted" on
the subject of how you want your encryption.  It's the best chance we may
have to say:
1. "We don't like the rigid, hierarchical trust model in PEM", and:
2. "We don't want any system incorporating key escrow (a la clipper)"
ViaCrypt PGP version 2.4 for MS-DOS is available from:

Plus $8.00 S & H, (and if you live in a small number of states, I can't
remember which ones, they make us collect sales tax.)
We intend to have ViaCrypt PGP available for just about every platform on
the planet.  We should be announcing the availability of ViaCrypt PGP for
several UNIX platforms shortly.  I hope to have MAC and Windows versions
available some time in the second quarter of 1994.
And I know it doesn't make for a great story, but at the CSI Computer
Security Conference in Anaheim a month ago, Phil Zimmermann was in our booth
(we asked him to come).  Jim Bidzos was at the same conference, making a
presentation.  There were no bloody brawls in the hallway, no shouting
matches, I don't think the two even encountered each other.  The rest of the
folks at the RSA booth stopped by, and were actually quite cordial. ho hum.
I apologize for the length of this message, but I hope it answers everyone's
questions.  If not, ask away, or feel free to contact me at ViaCrypt. (If
you call ViaCrypt with questions, I'm the one you'll probably talk to, by
the way.)

David Barnhart

@_subject: Who knows a good basic text on Huffman Codes 
I am referring to the minimum bits  coding scheme invented by DAVID HUFFMAN
in 1951.
I would like something that does some concrete examples in radix other than 2
hanks for your help.
I think Huffman is at ucal-santa cruz and would like to know his e-mail address
as well.
He was at MIT back in the fifties and worked with Fano et al on coding theory.

@_subject: Noninteractive use of PGP 2.6 _help requested 
I would like to know how to set up PGP 2.6 UNIX so that I can filter(ELM) mail
through PGP from the filter without being signed on the(remote) system. I
believe that the path variable is involved($PGPPATH).
The ELM filter works fine while I am physically signed on but stops encrypting
when I send mail to the filter from a remote account. Presumably the program
looks at the "current"directory for public key files---/usr/local/bin/pgp and
the keys are really in my personal account   /usr/homef/me/.pgp.
I am NOT UNIX expert so if you send a response a 4th grade programming level
explanation will not be viewed as "playing down"
I am assuming I can use "setenv $PGPPATH =/usr/homef/me/pgp"  in csh and that
will work while I am logged into the account. Question (I think)is how to
provide a path statement while I am not signed on and have th csh-ell active.
Some sample statements are helpful.
BTW the same question is interesting for Procmail and I would apprecitae some
recipes from the cyphercognoscenti for this problem

@_subject: VCRPLUS Huffman code 
Has anyone worked out the VCRPLUS code?
The TVGuide has a litsing  which can be used to set up a VCR by
employing a series of numbers which encode date/timestart/timefinish/channel
in a minimized sequence which I believe is a Huffman code(David Huffman-MIT MS
thesis 1954) I am interested in if anyone has taken the time to figure out
the algorithm?
please respond to me directly so as not to clutter the list if you don't mind.
