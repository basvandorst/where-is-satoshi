I like the concept, but not with the ad for commercial PGP at the
expense of GnuPG and others. Though I think the following poster who
suggested scanning the email itself for the PGP identifier might be more
useful and less prone to being fooled by someone who just puts the
header in there without actually encrypting. Also, headers don't have to
be in a specific order, it's possible that "From:" or "Subject:"
accidentally get moved ahead of "X-PGP-Encrypted:" by mistake and that
would result in a false bounce.

I disagree completely with the use of the term "intellectual property"
because the laws governing copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade dress,
and trade secrets are not property laws. Not only is the term
"intellectual property" deceptive, misleading, and ambiguous, the people

My concern is that they take the stance that allowing Tor is a
liability. Sure, there are people who will abuse Tor, but the benefits
of being able to access, say, Pepsi's web site without revealing you're
doing so from Coca-Cola's corporate network should not be ignored.
That's what Tor was originally intended to be used for, among other
things. I concede it was inevitable that some would use it for evil, but

encryption solution out there is either proprietary, only available for
one operating system, or both.
To me, any true successor to TrueCrypt will be available under GPLv3
(not sure I like the idea of someone forking a BSD/MIT licensed clone
and then not sharing the source, aka the "BSD/MIT Tuck And Run"), and
for at least GNU/Linux and Windows (ideally Mac OS X as well). While I
never really needed something like TrueCrypt while it was maintained,
that doesn't mean I won't in the future, and I know there are others who
need TrueCrypt (including multi-platform support).

References: This is correct.
It could be any number of things. Some ISPs even sell access packages
with "family-friendly" filtering built in. Spyware or logging of sites
accessed wouldn't be too far of a leap from this.
By their nature, I would expect most garden variety anti-spyware
packages to not consider "parental control" type tools as spyware and
not detect them. They certainly aren't viruses. I think most
anti-spyware tools on Windows require administrator access to run.
There's no easy way to detect screenshots being taken. You would need to
check the local hard disk for copies of the screenshots, and outbound
network traffic for something that could be a screenshot being uploaded.
This is difficult at best without administrator access.
It would be best, but it may not be possible if the computer is secured
correctly. The parent threat model (as a minor child) is a particularly
tough nut to crack. Even if you subvert the technical spying measures,
there could be consequences for doing so. At least where I live in the
US, minors can't own property legally, so parents can spy on a computer
that  "belongs to" their kids.
If your friend's parents feel the need to spy on his/her Internet
access, there are issues beyond the technological ones. There is a basic
lack of trust on the part of the parents, possibly caused by their poor
parenting of your friend when he/she was younger, that needs to be
addressed. In other words, find out why they feel spying is necessary.
In the meantime, your friend may want to do the majority of his/her
Internet access from the local library; it may not be completely
uncensored but there is a much lower chance of being individually spied
on there.

Great speech, but...
Shouldn't this be something else, perhaps the Communications and Media
Authority? The FCC is a US agency.

References: <20160706120529.GB7697
I use Gmail for as little as possible, usually only to email myself
things to my main account on Fastmail (rushpost.com is one of their
vanity domains). The "theft alerts" on my Android phone go to my Gmail
because there's no way to send them elsewhere. A few emails from Google
go there because it's either a pain in the ass or impossible to send
them elsewhere. It's also another backup email for my social media
In a perfect world I believe I wouldn't have to use Gmail at all. There
is a reason we have the ability to put other domains after the " after

Not all of them; in fact I think Android has taken the lead over iOS in
mobile phones, though I understand if one balks at trusting Google.
There is also Windows Phone, though I'm personally not too keen on
trusting Microsoft.
Anyway, getting back to the topic of the original message: I don't use
the fingerprint unlock functionality on my devices for exactly this
reason. Fingerprints can't be changed when compromised; passwords can.

The existence of this malware is bad enough if it can be disabled, or
changed to no longer be a threat. The fact that the CPU will not boot or
will not stay running if this "other" CPU is physically removed, makes
this a disaster. This makes the Pentium FDIV and F00F bugs look like the
missing yellow key bug in MAP31 of the TNT: Evilution episode of Final
Doom. (Which is to say, an annoyance but one which can be easily worked
Do AMD CPUs have these yet? How about other manufacturers (if there are
any left)? Is this something we have to worry about today on any new
computer designed for Intel CPUs, or is this just for "enterprise-level"
gear? How do I know if a computer has this *before* I buy it?

I am all for freedom of speech, but a list started for a specific
purpose becomes useless if most, or even many, of the posts are
off-topic. The tor-talk list (which I do not subscribe to) was started
for a specific purpose, and allowing the continued posting of off-topic
garbage defeats the whole purpose of having such a list.
I don't work for the US military or US government, but I support the TOr
Project's and Graham Boyce's efforts to restore order to the list in
principle. Those who have threatened to rejoin the list under other
identities have committed a despicable and reprehensible act and deserve
the ban from the forum they have received. I will admit that sometimes our governments in the US sometimes get it
wrong when passing laws. We as a nation have learned from our mistakes
and the history of the laws reflect this. To infiltrate an e-mail list
originated from private computer systems with off-topic posts, and then
to threaten to continue doing so despite being banned from that list is
against the law in most states and I believe violates Federal law as
well. It is the right of the Tor Project and the people behind it to
refuse to re-publish off-topic messages. To that effect, I support the
Tor Project taking legal action against any such offenders if that
becomes necessary.
Before anyone even asks, my beliefs are the same regardless of whether
or not Jacob Applebaum is guilty of what he has been accused of. (I do
consider it noteworthy that so far such accusations have only been made
in the court of public opinion, not in any court of law.)

Graham Boyce alluded to it in one of his messages.
His inbox, his rules.
Tor Project's mailing list, Tor Project's rules.
That said, I am inclined to be nice and warn first. However, I feel no
obligation to do so, particularly if a disruptive participant knows
he/she is being disruptive and/or posting off-topic on purpose.
The US, its states and cities, and for that matter most of the civilized
world, is run by laws. Yes, sometimes the people that make those laws
get it wrong, but I believe at least with the laws regarding harassment
and unauthorized computer system access, they got it right.
That said, one should not need to read a law book or a holy book to know
how to behave as a member of decent society. Threatening to rejoin a
mailing list one has just been booted from, is not how decent people

More like Mr. Boyce just wanted order restored to a mailing list he
enjoyed reading, that had been made unusable by the volume of off-topic
or garbage posts over most of a month.
Any project like Tor relies on its fair share of volunteers to make
stuff happen. That doesn't necessarily mean those volunteers are on the
government payroll, if anything it would mean quite the opposite. It's
also unnecessarily pejorative to call that "dirty work." I really think
all the majority of the tor-users list readership wants, is an on-topic
list. That's what Mr. Boyce gave them. Their list, their rules. If you
don't like it, start your own list with whatever topic you want.
With freedom of speech, comes freedom to decide what to ignore. To flood
a mailing list with off-topic and garbage posts, intrudes upon the
freedom of speech for the participants of that list who want to discuss
the named topic.

I've never engaged in ad hominem attacks on this list, and I don't think
they have a place here. This post starts with an ad hominem attack, and
goes on to slam those who run the Tor Project (some of which are likely
volunteers), while incorrectly saying they all work for the US military.
To the rest of the readership on this list (besides the original
poster), do you consider this acceptable?
Once upon a time, cypherpunks was a place where constructive discussion
was the norm, and outright garbage being posted to the list was not.
Now, it seems it is the reverse of that. What do we have to do to fix

I shouldn't have to. That's what community standards of decent behavior
are for. That's what moderation is for.
As part of the community, it is your call. A simple "no, I consider this
unacceptable" would have sufficed.
That's a complete non-solution, as it means I lose all of the quality
messages along with the crap. It is throwing the proverbial baby out
with the bathwater.
Standing up for someone's right to pollute the list with messages that,
in all honesty, contribute nothing to civil discussion, is bad enough.
Your suggestion that I unsubscribe is many times worse than that.
Maybe circa 2003-2006 or so, it used to not be like this. At least, I
don't remember it being anywhere near this bad, even when there was the
occasional flaming going on. I've never seen someone spew one attack
after another after another.
Getting banned from a mailing list, in general, should serve as a
warning that one's conduct is unacceptable. If this describes you,
recently, please heed that warning.

As used today, with many people using services like GMail, Hotmail, etc
it could be considered centralized. However, in the sense that I can set
up my own email server, and have someone email me at a given address
without having to get approved by a central authority first, it is
decentralized. Email doesn't even strictly require DNS to work, as there
is an email address syntax (rarely used these days, but still
technically valid) for addressing email directly to a given userid at a
specific IP address by dotted quad.
