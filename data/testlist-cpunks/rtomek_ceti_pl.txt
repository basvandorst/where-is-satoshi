I think "moderate" is the right choice of a word. Not sure how moderate you want to go in your moderating, how about removing wifi (it's on PCIe card, AFAIK), or, say, crushing BT with heavy pincers? No, I cannot recomend anything like this, I didn't allow pincers into my laptop...
I have recently tried a few Debian-related distros on my X61 (which seems to be smaller brother of X60, i.e. lots of shared hw AFAIK). Ubuntu and Mint boot and work o-o-t-box. Those were just for testing :-/, Debian works too, with X and sound (not sure if I used sound under Debian). FreeBSD - for some reason I am always between after-install and comfortable-using it, at least on laptops and desktops, which is where I tried it so far. Booted it few times into console, X doesn't work on X61, for me.
Seconded, for the pros you gave. I'd consider recompiling kernel. Debian does not have the most recently updated hot-fancy-pansy software, other than security updates - but even in this case, I'd say priority is to backport patch into version included in one's current Debian distribution. So soft is acceptably new when I dist-upgrade but as months go by, it gets a bit old. OTOH, during my circa 15 years of using it, I rarely felt bad about not having the latest version of something installed. With some exceptions, like browsers, java and mplayer, but see below. Most of the other soft I use is stable enough to not undergo revolutionary changes. And besides, I don't really want to be surprised by a bug which took a free ride on top of some revolutionary change.
One huge pro, so far, is that Debian does not push its choice of window manager down my throat. I use fvwm and I want it to stay so (after extensive periods of gnome and kde, so I guess they lack something). For a laptop, I would either use a console with screen or maybe some mouseless WM - there is plenty to choose from (try to befriend aptitude and apt-* tools). The default in newer distro is some lightweight decently looking kde-replacement, forgot its name, should be good for noncomputing parents/spouses/siblings (children would use Android/iOS anyway).
Another good pro is ability to download full source code (about 7-8 dvds, security updates put onto separate disc) and compile it while in places without easy net access. At least I assume it would work. This pro is of course shared by some other OSes, too. In case of Debian, however, I guess it's safe to assume that all sources fit nicely with each other, compile without complaining, so once you got full copy it is all that you will need. This theory I am yet to test - I know this all compiles on devel's cluster but I think I should test before I claim anything more.
As of patching packages, I don't do it because I never had such need. Albeit I tinkered a bit with them when I decided to backport some new packages into my oldie distro. Tools for this are rather easy to use, but from time to time one has to modify some file so the new stuff compiles with older lib etc. Sometimes, such backporting turns into recursive backporting which is why emacs is one of the compiler's helper tools :-).
When I want newer version of something, I use stow for stuff going into to install into /opt/{specific_dir}. Thus the core of my sys remains stable and pure, like the devs meant it to be. Stuff from /usr/local is on standard PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH, so it is more integrated into usual sys works. Stuff from /opt I use by adding apropriate dirs into ENV variables. Thus I can easily switch between various versions - or revert to stable defaults when I have to.
And last but not least, there are third party repositories (chrome, opera, backports, marillat and some more) which offer latest versions and work with one's current distro. Those are easy to add - just a line or two in A some kind of cons is this: after many many many years and many dist-upgrades, so much cruft is collected in /etc (mostly, my mods to config files, backups of mods and origs, some custom scripts residing in installing from a scratch. Other than this, I consider my current os to be twelve years old and counting :-). Perhaps it's time to put /etc into some kind of version control regime. Longevity has its own share of strange problems and strange solutions - not that I am against longevity.
Sooner or later you will want to compile, so don't worry. I'd have still used Debian, with Slackware or Gentoo being strong secondary choices. But I don't have significant experience with those, so I can't recommend.
Yep. Debian, at least, is quite well documented. dwww is my tried old friend. It's possible to install books and manuals from additional packages, those integrate nicely into dwww and can later be accessed with a browser. dwww includes manpages and infopages into this common browsable interface, too, very very cute.
But if you desire a lot to go exotic way, you may have a look at this:
I didn't try it. But it looks interesting. Maybe it's worth a try.

How a smart meter knows what I'm watching
   Posted on [32]January 15, 2013 by [33]Menno van Doorn
   Last   year   Researchers   of  from  M|nster  University  of  Applied
   Sciences demonstrated  that  consumers  can be identified via the data
   collected by  a  smart meter, from the types and amount of devices, TV
   shows  being watched  and  scan  for  copyright-protected (or pirated)
   movies.  If  you want  to  see  how  they  predict  what movie you are
   watching, based on
   data  form  your  smart  meter,  start  at   approx 14:40 minutes. The
   video is called "Smart Hacking For Privacy"
   IFRAME: [34]
   The  brightness  of  the  backlight  influences  the  energy  use  and
   is refelcted  in  the  data  that go to the smart meter. The fact that
   smart meters  collect  data every two seconds makes it possible to get
   very accurate  graphs.  That's how they are able to recognize patterns
   in
   energy use and compare with patterns in a movie database.
   What's    your    opinion?    Should    we    keep    these    Privacy
   Intrusive Technologies out of our homes? Or should we fix the problems
   with Privacy  Enhancing  Technologies? Here's what I think. Fix it: we
   need a smarter grid.

(... links deleted ...)
Companies Are Putting Sensors On Employees To Track Their Every Move
   [101]Vivian Giang | Mar. 14, 2013, 6:23 PM | 16,986 | [102]56
   team work group
   [111]joelabell via Instagram
   The  idea  of  having employees walk around with electronic sensors to
   track  their  every  move  is  unsettling. There are privacy and legal
   issues, and who wants to feel like they are just a cog in a system?
   But  [112]data  companies  say that the resulting reams of information
   will improve life for companies and employees.
   [113]Sociometric  Solutions has created tracking devices for [114]Bank
   of  America,  Steelcase,  and  Cubist  Pharmaceuticals Inc., and is in
   talks  with  General Motors. It was started by a team of Ph.D students
   from  MIT who decided to study the chemistry behind what makes certain
   workspaces like [115]Google great at building teams. They came up with
   sensors placed in employee identification badges that gather real-time
   information  to  help  companies  measure  productivity.  The  sensors
   identify  a  person's  tone  of voice, movement and even their posture
   when communicating with others.
   "Google  really  cares  about  creating a community because the social
   conversations  --  the ones at the water cooler, coffee maker -- those
   are  the ones that have the biggest impact," says Ben Waber, president
   of  Sociometrics  and  one  of  the  company's founders. "In the U.S.,
   there's  this  notion  that  your  most productive time is when you're
   sitting  at  your  desk  staring  at  the  computer,"  and  that's not
   necessarily true.
   The  sensors  are intended to measure when and how employees are truly
   productive. While individual information is collected, it's anonymized
   to   provide   metadata   and  hedge  against  privacy  concerns.  The
   information  is then used to suggest how employees, and the company as
   a whole, can work more efficiently.
   "The legality behind this," says Arena, "that's the biggest unanswered
   question.  Privacy online is sort of open and privacy issues are going
   to  be  the  stumbling  block  for  a long time. And that's a big, big
   question."
   The tracking sensors
   Waber's  team  places  electronic  sensors in employees' badges, which
   includes a Bluetooth, a microphone (it doesn't record what people say,
   but  rather  the  tone  of their voice, speaking speed, and volume), a
   motion sensor to measure movement, and an infrared beam.
   tracking device sensor
   Sociometric Solutions
   A sociometric sensor device.
   The idea is that these analytic tools can help determine the nature of
   the  conversations  people are having. For example, the microphone can
   measure  speaking  tone,  and  the higher someone's tone or the faster
   they  speak  can  indicate  how  excited or passionate they are at any
   given time.
   The  infrared can also sense if another badge is in sight, which gives
   researchers  an  idea of how people stand when speaking to others. For
   example,  people who usually have others facing them when speaking are
   more  dominant  personalities.  On the other hand, when two people are
   engaged  in  an  interesting conversation, they will likely mirror one
   another, which signals more equality.
   "We've  been  able  to  foretell,  for example, which teams will win a
   business plan contest, solely on the basis of data collected from team
   members wearing badges at a cocktail reception," [116]Alex Pentland, a
   professor  at MIT and also an advisor to Waber's group, wrote [117]for
   the Harvard Business Review.    Since   privacy  is  the  biggest  concern  over  the  devices,  after
   behavioral/productivity   reports   are  sent  to  individuals,  their
   identities  are  removed  from the system so the names associated with
   individual sensors are never revealed to employers.
   The testing grounds
   Bank  of America got on board with the sensors a few years ago when it
   wanted  to  study  how  group dynamics impacted performance. It tested
   them  out  on  90  call  center employees. Arena says that the company
   discovered  how  important  it  was  to allow employees to take breaks
   together.  During  that time, employees would often troubleshoot their
   workplace  problems.  While  sensors didn't monitor conversation, they
   did  report  "a  cohesiveness  was shared between the coworkers," says
   Arena, and the company eventually experienced a 10 percent improvement
   in  productivity  by  making  some workplace culture changes after the
   study.
   Although  Bank of America tested its call center employees, Arena said
   he thinks the data "has bigger ramifications in professional jobs than
   anywhere else," because you will inevitably be able to "understand how
   one person steps into the room and influences others."
   "It  has  greater ramifications in leadership than hourly workers, but
   it's  in  the early stages." Arena is now the head of global talent at
   General  Motors,  and  told  us the company is considering "doing very
   similar things."
   [118]Steelcase,  which  makes office furniture, works with Sociometric
   to  develop sensory products for its own merchandise. For example, its
   [119]new   chair,   Gesture,  is  "[120]designed  to [121]support  our
   interactions  with  today's  technologies"  and  was  "inspired by the
   movement of the human body." The new chair can actually tell employers
   how  it's  being used by employees, which will give employers a better
   idea  of what size tables and chairs to buy in order to promote better
   communication and, inevitably, a more productive team.
   "What  we hoped to learn was how things influence interactions and how
   spaces affect those interactions," Dave Lathrop, director of workspace
   futures and strategy at the company, told us.
   Lathrop  says  most  of us don't know how we interact with others. For
   example,  if  you have a dominating personality, you could be "forcing
   people  to  shut down" and make them distrust you without even knowing
   it.
   "[122]Yahoo  and  [123]Best  Buy are asking people to come back to the
   office,  which  does  suggest  that there's a general belief that when
   people  get  physically  together,  it's valuable," he says. "We're at
   this  magical moment where we can do things that we couldn't do before
   ...  having  the  analytics  that  we  do.  ...  As  a researcher, I'm
   incredibly  hopeful that this will give us good data on the quality of
   interactions between people."
   But at the end of the day, employees need to feel comfortable with the
   idea of being tracked, even if it's anonymously -- and that may take a
   while.

Stuxnet, gone rogue, hit Russian nuke plant, space station
A cyber-security expert says several ostensibly secure facilities became
victims of the virus that struck Iran's nuclear program
   By [30]David Shamah November 11, 2013, 4:21 pm    [36]Eugene Kaspersky (Photo credit: Courtesy Tel Aviv University)    Eugene Kaspersky (Photo credit: Courtesy Tel Aviv University)
   A  Russian  nuclear power plant was reportedly "badly infected" by the
   rogue Stuxnet virus, the same malware that reportedly disrupted Iran's
   nuclear  program  several  years  ago.  The  virus  then spread to the
   International   Space   Station   via  a  Stuxnet-infected  USB  stick
   transported by Russian cosmonauts.
   Speaking  to  journalists  in  Canberra,  Australia, last week, Eugene
   Kaspersky, head of the anti-virus and cyber protection firm that bears
   his name, said he had been tipped off about the damage by a friend who
   works at the Russian plant.
   Kaspersky  did  not  say when the attacks took place, but implied that
   they occurred around the same time the Iranian infection was reported.
   He  also did not comment on the impact of the infections on either the
   nuclear  plant  or  the  space  station,  but  did say that the latter
   facility had been attacked several times.
   The  revelation  came  during  a  question-and-answer  period  after a
   presentation on cyber-security. The point, Kaspersky told reporters at
   Australia's  National  Press  Club  last  week,  was  that  not  being
   connected  to  the  Internet  --  the public web cannot be accessed at
   either  the nuclear plant or on the ISS -- is a guarantee that systems
   will  remain  safe.  The  identity of the entity that released Stuxnet
   into  the  "wild" is still unknown (although media speculation insists
   it was developed by Israel and the United States), but those who think
   they  can  control  a  released  virus are mistaken, Kaspersky warned.
   "What  goes  around  comes around," Kaspersky said. "Everything you do
   will boomerang."
   The  Stuxnet  virus  came  to  light  in 2010, having attacked Iranian
   nuclear   facilities   by   hitting  the  programmable  logic  control
   automation  systems that control them. The PLC system, manufactured by
   German  conglomerate  Siemens,  runs  the  centrifuges  used to enrich
   uranium  at  Iran's Natanz facility. Variants of Stuxnet have affected
   the  facility's  centrifuges  in  various ways, mostly by changing the
   activity  of  valves  controlled  by  the  PLC  software that feed the
   uranium  to  centrifuges  at  a specific rate required for enrichment,
   Kaspersky said in several presentations last year.
   It's  not  known when Stuxnet began its activities, but researchers at
   anti-virus  company Symantec said that they had gathered evidence that
   earlier  versions of the code were already seen "in the wild" in 2005,
   although it wasn't yet operational as a virus. Stuxnet, said Symantec,
   was  the first virus known to attack national infrastructure projects,
   and  according  to the company, the groups behind Stuxnet were already
   seeking  to  compromise  Iran's  nuclear  program  in 2007 -- the year
   Iran's  Natanz  nuclear  facility, where much of the country's uranium
   enrichment is taking place, went online.
   Now  that  the  plague  has  been unleashed, said Kaspersky, no one is
   immune  --  and  that  includes  its originators, who are no longer in
   control of it. "There are no borders" in cyberspace, and no one should
   be  surprised  at  any  reports  of  a  virus  attack,  no  matter how
   ostensibly secure the facility, he said.

USB condom, great name :-).
Last time I amused myself with such idea (say, few months ago), I
ended up reading specs of stm32f4 family of single board
microcontrollers, mostly because my local shop sells them. They have
like 1MB of flash, my fav has 192kB of ram (not sure, in one piece or
banks? and yes, it's kilo-bytes, not kilo-bits, according to web
page), I guess they have enough io pins to solder usb and/or ether
connectors to them. Plus, ARM Cortex-M cpu  MHz. Very very cute,
for me.
It's a bit of overkill but I really dislike boards with 512 bytes of
ram (what kind of compiler could I fit into this? binary lambda self
interpreter, maybe, cool, but what else besides it - and how much
could I use it for computing rather than led blinking, although leds
could make it look sexier).
Also, I myself would not use L4. No bad feelings about it but, sounds
a bit too huge for this task, meybe? Since I don't know too much about
all this stuff, I guess I'd start with C or Forth on bare metal. I had
not enough time to make sure I could develop for it using Linux/BSD,
since other OSes are no-no.

Oh I see. Using L4 makes sense then. But, if concern goes as far as
files prepared with hostile intent, I again mused myself once (what a
muser I am) with idea of filtering this stuff through
software/converter running on non-386 emulator, like PDP-10 (simh or
something, running TOPS-* is optional), vax (again simh, some modern
bsd should fit) or even S/380 (modified Hercules emulator, modern
variation on S360 mainframe, hobby project, gnu software ported to
MVS/380 which itself descends from one commercial mainframe os, which
at one point of time became public domain - if memory serves, of
Since those are all musings and no hard work, I cannot claim any kind
of success or if this makes any sense or not at all. Seems doable,
requires time and reading some old manuals written on typewriter and
scanned, and the font is ugly and scales poorly on 6'' ebook reader...

some agencies may have it in the job contract, explicit or not, but

Oh, btw. Can she be punished if she forgot to charge her phone (say,

Exactly! The woman in original post was dealing with small brother,
which is very different to dancing with big bro (despite some people
making claims and noises like it was the very "big bro" himself -
maybe not on this list, I'm not sure, I don't trace so much "who what
and where").
My point was, she could play the "nuissance" and "strangeness" to her
advantage. Especially if she lived in some part of the world where
suing is not so customary but the law still says "in dubio pro reo" -
in case of doubt, give ear to the accused. She decided to milk dollars
from the fat cow, which is probably ok, too - I only barely know the
case as it was described in the news.

Both your asses are wrong. Here is what my brain says: given that vast
majority of current wave are lone males, I expect their families are
going to join them in short time - or ASAP?, because they sit in
refugee camps out of Europe and the camps are sometimes (often?)
underfunded (funds ran out?). So the target is going to be few
millions, plus minus few more. Depends how big families are, on
average. If we assume 1 (lone male) +1 (mother) +(2+n) children +(0+x)
(close relatives we cannot leave behind) then the number starts from 3
millions and there is not too many ways I can think of to make it
Then, if they all are successfully accomodated, expect another
wave. Actually, expect it anyway.
All those new people might be a problem or may be not. At the moment
it seems that so called institutions are caught with their pants down,
so any problem gets exacerbated. For example, is there any kind of
preparation in advance to give few millions kids decent education once
they get here? Otherwise, in twenty years there will be few millions
of undereducated very angry young ready for anything baaad baaad
jobless illiterate aliens.
As of possible furrorists, they are already here so it is too late to
close the doors. Actually, it seems that furrorists are recruited from
EU-born youth, so defending doors is going to be a bit futile, like
few decades too late futile.
Now, sure this is offtopic, so more to the subject. I need some help
from you guys. I need to do me a cypherpunk hairdo. So, should I stick
some Intel chips into my red mohawk? How many? Is it ok to use old
cheap Pentiums or should I only go with Core 2? Or maybe I should
stick a bunch of resistors into the mohawk, or maybe even some nixie
lamps - but I wouldn't like to look too old, so maybe ARM chips will
be this year's chic?  Is it ok to decorate one of my cheeks with
Enigma-encoded text? How about AES? And another problem: I would like
to cut off about 4cm of ethernet cord, with a plug and stick it into
my nose so that plug shows up from the hole. But I would also like to
glue BT dongle to my other cheek. And I feel that if I do both I will
be looked down even by cypherpunks. So what should I choose? I am so
No need to hurry up with advice, however. I need to grow some hairs to
make mohawk from it. Or maybe I will be ok staying with my current
crew cut and sticking some microSDs on it, plug ends up, usb hub glued
to my forehead, rot13 in perl on my cheeks? Please help.
Now, ok. I was joking. In fact if I ever have red mohawk, I will
probably glue single board computer (not Arduino, they are too nice
for me) with some leds, 2000mAh AA, blinking random numbers based on
GPS pos, time, temp and noise. So I do not really seek for advice on
my future c-punk hairdo, but of course constructive thoughts are

   Russians Rewrite History to Slur Ukraine Over War
   Simon Shuster / Moscow     Oct. 29, 2014
(quotations start here)
   Vladimir Putin has turned the idea of fascism into a political
   tool, and now Russian historians are adapting to the Kremlin line
   The trio of German historians, as well as a handful of their
   colleagues from Eastern Europe, flew into Moscow last week for what
   they thought would be a conference on the history of Nazi war
   crimes. It was the fifth in a series of international summits held
   every other year since 2006, first in Berlin and Cologne, then in
   Slovakia and Belarus, to keep alive the memory of the towns and
   villages destroyed during World War II. But the German co-chairman
   of the conference, Sven Borsche, began to feel that something was
   amiss in Moscow as soon as he met his Russian hosts. “All they
   wanted to talk about was the conflict in Ukraine,” he says.
   Even without the simultaneous translations provided for the foreign
   guests, they would have gotten the political message. The
   photographs shown by several of the Russian speakers put the
   atrocities of the Nazi SS right alongside pictures from the current
   war in eastern Ukraine. There is not much difference, the Russian
   historians suggested, between the actions of the Ukrainian military
   in its war against separatist rebels and the atrocities that
   Hitler’s forces committed during World War II.
   This rhetoric—calling it an argument would overstate its relation
   to facts—has recently come into vogue among Russian
   historians. Under their interpretation of history, the struggle
   that began with the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941
   continues for Russia today, in a direct line through the
   generations, with the conflict in Ukraine. That is the connection
   President Vladimir Putin first presented to the Russian people in
   March, when he sent his troops to invade and annex the Ukrainian
   region of Crimea. The Russian-speaking residents of that peninsula,
   he said in a speech on the day of the annexation, need Russia’s
   protection from Ukraine’s new leaders, whom he referred to as
   “neo-Nazis and anti-Semites.” Ukraine’s ensuing war to prevent
   Russia from seizing any more of its territory has likewise been
   branded a fascist campaign against ethnic Russians.
   As these speeches were translated for the foreign delegates,
   including guests from the Czech Republic and Slovakia, their faces
   turned gradually from confusion to disgust. Joerg Morre, the
   director of Berlin’s Karlhorst Museum, which focuses on the history
   of the eastern front in World War II, began to fidget in his
   seat. “I mean, to show the photographs of the Second World War and
   then switch in the next slide to what’s happening in Ukraine,”
   Morre told me during a break in the conference, “No way is that
   right. Now way!” Borsche, the co-chairman, agreed with him: “It’s
   polemical!” he said.
   As the conference drew to a close, the two of them decided to voice
   their objections. Morre, springing from his seat, took hold of the
   microphone and told the hall that he did not agree with the final
   declaration of the conference, which had been written by its
   Russian organizers. Specifically, he took issue with the clause
   that declared, “Our generation is facing the task to deter [the]
   revival of Fascism and Nazism,” a thinly veiled reference to
   Ukraine, the German delegates felt. “It has become clear that we
   have different views on what fascism means today,” Morre told the
   hall in nearly perfect Russian. “Your point of view is not mine. So
   I call for this part of the resolution to be removed,” he added. “I
   do not want to sign it, and I am not the only one.”
   After some noisy debate, the delegates agreed to put the matter to
   a vote. Practically all of the foreign participants raised their
   hands in favor of deleting the reference to a “revival” of European
   fascism. All of the Russian participants, including a large group
   of high school students who had been herded into the auditorium
   about 15 minutes earlier, had the clear majority in voting to leave
   the text of the declaration unchanged. So the hosts of the
   conference won out—a small but telling victory for the cause of
   Russian revisionism.
   Outside the hall, Borsche seemed at a loss for words as he waited
   in the coat-check line. He had served as one of the initiators of
   the conference and its co-chairman, flying in from Germany for the
   occasion to discuss a shared history of suffering during World War
   II. But he says he had no idea that his Russian colleagues would
   use it as a chance to promote their political agenda against
   Ukraine. “That’s not correct,” he told me. If there is some lesson
   to be learned from the experience, it’s a familiar one, he said:
   “The more people are convinced of their own opinion, the more they
   become estranged from other opinions. That’s a real difficult
   problem.” And as Russia sets out to redefine what Nazism means, it
   is a problem that Western historians will somehow have to face.
(quotations end here)
I can only imagine when people find out about this, they will run like
hares and mad cows straight to non-western countries. Spread the word,
man. Also, buy your tickets while you can, before the mad crowd
prevents you from running away from this horrible place. Even better,
once you buy tickets, use them asap, go to your destination, meet your
dreams. Do not forget to drop few words to the list, so other lost
souls know what to expect outside.

I guess Russia is no longer powerful enough to openly break treaties
it signed:
   "The Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances refers to three
   identical political agreements signed in Budapest, Hungary on 5
   December 1994, providing security assurances by its signatories
   relating to Belarus', Kazakhstan's and Ukraine's accession to the
   Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The Memorandum
   was originally signed by three nuclear powers, the Russian
   Federation, the United States of America, and the United
   Kingdom. China and France gave somewhat weaker individual
   assurances in separate documents.
   The memorandum included security assurances against threats or use
   of force against the territorial integrity or political
   independence of Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan."
In light of this act, if I was responsible for Russian politics, and I
received a plea to join Russia by a foreign party belonging to country
which integrity I myself guaranteed - such a plea would smell rather
fishy to me. Unless, of course, I predicted great bonuses if I agree
and let them join me. Never mind that right now there is huge loss of
money for Russia, they will replenish their finances in a future,
This works the other way too. How about people who want to defend
their families, children, houses and friends from living in Russia?
And I was so certain that daesh had been financed by some wealthy
people from Near East.
Some people will believe just anything.
Oh, do you mean you know/learn Russian? Because this is the best way
to read Russian propaganda. Try to be like Aleksandr, who (I guess)
already knows Russian and learned English, so he can read the
propaganda from both sources without having to count on strangers'
good will and faithfulness.
Actually, do not limit yourself to mere propaganda. It would have been
so cheap, you know. Russian culture is vast and rich. Try it. Some
names to explore, if you need a starter: Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Mikhail
Sholokhov, Isaac Babel, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Osip Mandelstam,
Mikhail Bulgakov, Varlam Shalamov. Some of them you can get for free,
from wikisources and other places. Even more of their works you can
find if you can read them from Russian wikisources.
I would say that cages made of barbed wire convert humans to
animals. So if I can choose, may I stay in my silver cage, please? It
does not really have to be golden one.
 ]:
(start quote)
   The most confusing thing about the imprisoned animals was that even
   supposing Oleg took their side and had the power, he would still
   not want to break into the cages and liberate them. This was
   because, deprived of their home surroundings, they had lost the
   idea of rational freedom. It would only make things harder for
   them, suddenly to set them free.
   This was the odd way Kostoglotov reasoned. His brain was so twisted
   that he could no longer see things simply and dispassionately.
   Whatever he experienced from now on, there would always be this
   shadow, this grey spectre, this subterranean rumbling from the
   past.

I can agree that Russia is no better than USA, only weaker and thus
has to achieve its goals with different means. As of "bad because
Russian", I do not say things like that. It is not my way. I suppose
if I was actually prejudiced, you would be feeling much more
I am rather busy pursuing my things. Maybe I will spare a while over
one of coming weekends. Did he delivered it somewhere on the net? Was
it edited or is it presented as it was?
Seems like you think there is something wrong with being one or another?
Too bad we will not share our experiences with Russian language. But I
have just learned about one guy, Dmitry Merezhkovsky. And Russian
symbolism. Like I wrote, Russian culture is vast and rich, so whenever
I look at it, I always come out with something interesting to learn
about. So you called me a troll in just right moment. Thanks!

spending good time with org I would rather not go back to notes.txt.

Looks nice. I guess you have your reason to make such choices and
perhaps I will try it myself one day. For now however, and in my case,
emacs does the job (keeping some activity log/record, notes, maybe
todo lists, maybe pieces of code - it seems there are some extremely
cool things possible when mixing code into org) so I tend to avoid
"more advanced" stuff [1]. I think it is possible to edit some (other)
wiki with org-mode and send content to it without needing a browser,
which would be huge plus for me. And if I was in need of wiki then
maybe I would look for something which does not require Javascript (as
Tiddly seems to, but I only glanced over few pages and into one zip).
YMMV, of course.
[1] Well, ok, if I see something as more advanced, I would at least
try to include it into my toolbox etc etc. My current needs are such
that emacs (and elisp) appear to be more advanced (compared to browser
and JS). But I have no intent to evangelize people about it.
