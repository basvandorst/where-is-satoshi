A company worth working for will have a policy that tells you you
cannot.  (Ok, those variables are a fuzzy issue - Very bad taste. The
violent stuff mentioned in the original article is clear cut, however)
So what's your point?
Creating a hostile environment with the expectation that you'll never
hire someone who's black is "ok"?

Gosh, no kidding?  Company policy isn't the same as fed law?
As I said, a company worth working for, will have a policy that
creates/preserves a decent working environment.
Violence is obviously out of line.  Or do you like being threatened?
I can see you're not worth bothering with.
Sad that I wasted this much time responding.

Smirk.  /I'm terrified/  I've said it before, and I'll say it again:
Never wrestle with a pig.  You both get dirty, and the pig likes it.
