@_subject: ANNOUNCEMENT:  Digest Version Changes Hosts 
The digest version [cypherpunks-d] of the cypherpunks mailing list has been moved to a faster host.
Previously it was under the care of majordomo at gateway.com, but it has been moved to the care and feeding of majordomo at hidden-foes.gateway.com.
The new machine has a big more disk, a bit more processor, and is on the fast end of a T1 [the other was at my home on the good 'ole shared 28.8k ANYWAY---->  If you were subscribed to the digest version already, you are still there.  If you would LIKE to subscribe to the digest version, just send e-mail to 'majordomo at hidden-foes.gateway.com' with the line 'subscribe cypherpunks-d' in the BODY.
The digest is created every 40k [or about 2-3 times/day it seems].  Please let me know directly if there are any problems with this new system.
BTW, the first issue after moving to the new system will be Volume 2, Issue 1.
