"There is reason to believe that intelligence agencies for major powers -- including the United States -- know how to remotely seize control of a car. So if there were a cyber attack on the car -- and I'm not saying there was, I think whoever did it would probably get away with it."
- Richard Clarke, US Counter-Terrorism Czar during Clinton and Bush.
