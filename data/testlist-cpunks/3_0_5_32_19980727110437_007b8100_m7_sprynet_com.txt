I often see the phrase 'pass Diehard test' though I don't see from
the documents of Diehard how to evaluate the volumenous printout
of Diehard to say exactly whether the test is passed or not. Furthermore
the component asc2bin.exe of Diehard is buggy.

My concrete problem is: With the bunch of p-values how does one
(in accordance with the intention of the designer of the package)
go about to determine that the test is passed at a certain confidence
level. I don't see anything in the documents instructing the user
to do this. Maybe I indeed missed something. Please point that out
in this case.

It may be of some interest for you to know that the designer of
Diehard has the rather uncommon habit of never answering mails with questions on his package. A bug report of mine was without answer. Later I learned that others have had the same experience.
