Thank you for your recent email.  Because we receive hundreds of email
messages every day, we must limit the use of our email communication to the
constituency of the Second Congressional District.
If you live in the Second Congressional District of Texas, please email me
by visiting my website at   Click on "Listening to
You", and then scroll down and click on "Or You Can Email Me".  You will
then find instructions on how to enter your address and comments through the
Write Your Representative system so I can provide you with a written
response.  This system is reserved for you as a constituent of the Second
Congressional District.  If you reside outside the 2nd Congressional District and need to reach me,
please write me at 208 Cannon House Office Building, Washington, DC 20515.
If you desire to talk to me or my staff by phone, please call (202)
Again, thank you for taking the time to contact me.
Jim Turner, M.C
