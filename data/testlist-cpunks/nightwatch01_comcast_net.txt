   Tim May is the perfect example why vigilante justice is generally considered to be a bad thing -- stupid assholes like Tim May spout off & take action based on paranoia instead of facts & principles of anarchy instead of justice and innocent parties get hurt.

 What a bleeding-heart moron you are, Eric!
  So the savages have a right to try to scam us, and we fat, rich Americans (at least us white ones, maybe the black ones never receive the
419 scams) should either give them some $$, or at least not try to stop the scams...
  It's tough to have a fair debate with you, when you resort to using some extrasensory psychic powers which I am lacking.

  But look at the bright side -- you've got a good excuse to keep smoking.

   You demonstrate that point well.

   I've said so very little here, but I do believe everything I've "said."  I'm still at a loss as to how what little I've said (written) here would allow any reasonable person to start assuming or even guessing that I use binoculars frequently and that I must be some sort of "FED."  In fact, I don't think a responable person could assume that, but then, from what I've seen of this forum so far, it's set up for venting obnoxious political diatribes based on dumb/paranoid assumptions ('He made an unfavorable, on-point response to John Young, therefore, he's probably a FED!') & guesses, not reasonable, intellectual discourse.  Your 'Nightwatch' speculation is rather amusing too.  I won't humiliate & confuse you with the truth.
   Thanks for the dance!  It was....educational, but now I'm bored of going in circles.  :)

  Obviously you're wasting time asking a stupid rhetorical question, since clearly you're
a paranoid loon.
  What malfeasance will the government in your fantasyland perform on the hundreds, or thousands
of people each day who might utilize the service to find out in general how the airport is functioning
at any particular time?
  Are you ASSuming that anyone who voluntarily gives their phone # & a flight # is
going to be expected to be a passenger on that flight, & thus subjected to whatever government evils
your sad little mind creates?    In the real world, plenty of friends, spouses, co-workers, etc. of the
traveling party may also *volunteer* to give their phone # & a flight # to check the flight.  Flight updates
SMS'ed yo cellular phones have already been done for years directly through most of the major airlines.
  Perhaps the FAA should cancel the service, in order for you to sleep better at night...
