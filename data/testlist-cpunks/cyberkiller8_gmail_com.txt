What about interoperability with other (standard - OpenPGP, etc.)
solutions? Because we all see a lot of "new and easy" tools for crypto
meant for "everyone", but even if one would come to trust one of them
(which is a separate matter), then each of them is it's own walled garden.
You know where this leads to - either use them all at once, or lose
contacts that are on the other side of the wall.

Even despite the quality of the crypto code in Tribler, it's a generally
common problem for all "anonymizers" (including TOR) - the connection to
clearnet. It's a double edged sword though - without it they are a lot
less likely to be a target, but also a lot less likely to become popular.

I'm going to defend XMPP too, but on the grounds that it's an already
established and widely used protocol, the overhead is minimal looking
from a modern point of view (even when not using the potentially
privacy-risky elements) and it was designed to be extendable. These are
imo good arguments to use xmpp instead of creating something new (again
:-P ).

(---snip the technical discussion about a new protocol---)
Stop right there...
It's really nice that so many of you got into the spirit and start
thinking about how to change xmpp to make it something new, but what are
you achieving here? It will end up being a new protocol, incompatible
with existing xmpp, it will take a few years to finish the spec, then
another 10+ years until any meaningful applications start using it (if
at all)... So yeah, except being "coder porn" it does nothing to help
the problem here and now.
I agree that xmpp is not perfect, it has some problems of its own, but
it is an already established and widely used and standard protocol, with
lots of implementations. From a practical point of view the best course
of action to get something fast is to use it, and put whatever new stuff
there is needed inside xmpp, keeping it compatible with the existing spec.
A technically pretty proto won't help, today’s world has a huge problem
with taking anything new. Better to stay with existing stuff, make it
maybe less efficient because of it, but it will be here fast, when it's
needed. Plus being less efficient is a no issue today, with fast
machines (you can use compression on the fly, yes really :-P ), loads of
storage, broadband connections (even the 3G data caps are getting larger
and larger each year), etc. People are sending gigabytes of binary files
in base64 each day in email messages, so why even care? ;-)
In my opinion the bottom line is - a small addition to existing xmpp has
a far larger chance of being widely adopted (by applications and by the
users) than a completely new protocol. And despite how awesome coder one
might be - you won't be able to write all those implementations yourself
or convince the masses to switch (again!).

BTW: I made an oath last july, which was f****** unbearably hot in my

Climate change is a fact, not something to believe/notbelieve.

I'm not sure I follow. Being angry at people who deny clinate change,
because of them less people care about the environment, seems like a
good idea to me.
There's not much else I can do, I already gave donations, signed
petitions, gave my computing power to climate model research in a BOINC
project, forced everyone in my family to use eco stuff (I'm pretty sure
they are still throwing away all trash unsegregated when I'm not looking
though). I lack the power to change the policies of the large most
polluting countries, and eco terrorism is quite difficult when they
shoot first and ask questions later.
Anyway, I'll drop the subject now.
OK, I'll stop feeding the troll.

Agree, heartbleed was a bigger problem, though I think I know why so
many people panic because of this.
My theory is, with heartbleed most folks thought they were unaffected,
cause not many noob people run a webserver. But with shellshock they can
test this on their own machine, with just 1 line of code and see the
"vulnerable" message, so suddenly this is a big deal for them.
So, don't panic & stay cool, unless you have some badly configured
servers or have a habit of running everything on your workstation
without checking. But then you got bigger problems than this ;-).
