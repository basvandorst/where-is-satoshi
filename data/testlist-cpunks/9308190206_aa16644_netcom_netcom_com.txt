@_subject: Cracking & auditing crypto protocols 
The person who built the standard "network license manager" for Unix
(flexlm) has offered us cypherpunks access to the protocol if we'll
try to crack it.
The auditing may indeed be duplicated.  By marketing departments, and for
the same reason as the Denning auditing -- marketing.  Solely.
There is no way that the selected group of people could crack a half-reasonable cryptosystem in a few weeks.  Real Cryptanalysts spend
months and years working on cracking cryptosystems, and none of the
panelists was a Real Cryptanalyst.  We had all the details of DES,
and it took 15 years to make a dent in it.
But they fooled you -- and maybe a lot of other people -- so there *is*
a function for such review panels.  Sponsoring one is a way to convince
innocent spectators who don't know better.  Marketing.
