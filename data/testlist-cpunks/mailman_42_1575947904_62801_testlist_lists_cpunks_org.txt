@_subject: Can images be coded so they cannot be downloaded? 
As a Web Designer, I am sure many other designers have this
same question.
I am ready to post a website live that has a famous picture on it.
My client is wondering if it can be coded so that the images
cannot be downloaded or copied from the website.
Would you know what coding to use to do this? I know it exists,
but have not been able to find it. The ones that do have it of
course only have one sentence on the "View Source" function
about it being a secure page.
Any help would be appreciated.
Thank You,
