THE CURRENT FAVOURABLE POLITICAL CLIMATE SINCE THE ASSUMPTION OF DUTY BY THE NEW CIVILIAN ADMINISTRATION PRESENTED AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THIS MONEY TO BE TRANSFERRED OUT OF THE COUNTRY.
HOWEVER, THE CODE OF CONDUCT BUREAU (CIVIL SERVANTS LAWS) DOES NOT ALLOW US TO OWN AND OPERATE FOREIGN ACCOUNT, THEREFORE, WE NEEDED  A  FOREIGN PARTNER THAT WILL PRESENT HIMSELF AS THE SUB-CONTRACTOR BY PROVIDING HIS BANK PARTICULARS SO THAT THE MONEY WILL BE TRANSFERRED INTO HIS COMPANYÂS OR PERSONAL ACCOUNT.  HENCE THE NEED OF YOUR BUSINESS IS NOT PARTICULARLY RELEVANT TO THE SUCCESS OF THIS TRANSACTION .  ALL WE REQUIRE IS YOUR WILLINGNESS TO PRESENT YOUR BANKING INFORMATION SO THAT THE MONEY WILL BE TRANSFERRED INTO YOUR ACCOUNT.
FOR YOUR  ASSISTANCE IN THIS BUSINESS, YOUR SHARE WILL BE 30% OF THE TOTAL SUM, I AND MY COLLEAGUE WILL TAKE 60% WHILE 10% WILL BE SET ASIDE TO OFF-SET ANY EXPENSES WE MAY INCURE IN THE COURSE OF THIS  TRANSACTION.  NOTE ALSO THAT SOME PART OF OUR OWN SHARE WILL BE USED FOR IMPORTATION OF PRODUCTS INTO NIGERIA WHILE THE REST WILL BE USED FOR FURTHER INVESTMENT YOU MAY ADVICE ON.  IF YOU ARE WILLING TO ASSIST US IN THIS TRANSACTION, PLEASE SEND THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION .  (1)NAME OF YOUR BANK AND ADDRESS (2)YOUR ACCOUNT NUMBER/BENEFICIARYÂS NAME. (3) YOUR PRIVATE TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBER FOR EASY COMMUNICATION.
