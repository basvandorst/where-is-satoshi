@_subject: PGP Tools under Linux 
That's interesting, because I developed it under Linux and MS/DOS, and there
was a lot of trouble at the beginning with it not running on big-endian
machines. It sounds like whoever "fixed" it for sparcs broke it for
little-endian machines. The original should still be on ftp.csn.net; get it
there and it should work.
Get the original, test it, and post the results.
Some people have asked if I am still around. Yes, I am, and I'm thinking
about a major update of PGPTools. The update would involve getting out any
persistent bugs I can find, cleaning up the code and making it completely
reentrant, and replacing all 2.3a modules with 2.6.x modules so it is
patent-safe. It also needs some kind of exception handling for disk errors
and the like. A pass-through function for the disk access calls, and a way
of freeing all memory before a longjmp to bail out, for example.
Before doing this, I need to hear from the PGP development team. There have
been rumors of an upcoming PGP API, something similar to PGPTools. If this
is the case, let me know so I don't waste time writing an incompatible
version. If this is not the case, let me know so I can get started.
More information about NexusBucks, please. Is it for real? How many coins in
circulation? Have any services been bought with them yet? What is the
address of the Magic Money server? Is it fully automatic, or are messages
being manually processed?
