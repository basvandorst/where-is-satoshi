@_subject: change of e-mail address 
I have a new e-mail address, now that I'm leaving Stratus:
This is a remailing address and should be permanent (for life).  It
replaces cme at stratus.com (in various subdomains) and cme at world.std.com.

P.S.  public keys available by finger cme at world.std.com
