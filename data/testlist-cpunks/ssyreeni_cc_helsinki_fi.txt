Not very, I think. It seems it's RAH's specialty. It's quite poetic,
Although 'geodesic' does have, through its use in general relativity, some
faint echo of 'operates purely based on local information', I think it's a
misnomer. People should rather use the term 'distributed' literally, as it's
used in computer science. That's the meaning RAH is after, not true?

No question about it. The term also doesn't mean a whole lot when applied
as-is in the many instances it is on this list. As Tim put it, it pretty
much equates to "cyberpunkish". What little I've grasped of RAH's usage
is that "geodesic" often translates as "distributed", one of the main
features of which is that it "operates based on locally available
information". Hence... Besides, if you know your Einstein (or Riemann, or
Minkowsky) even a little bit you will recognize that one of the prime
reasons for the development of a geometric interpretation of physics is the
need to have a solid theory not reliant on instantaneous transfer of
information ("local"). My interpretation is not unreasonable at all,
considering the alternatives. Wanna drop it?

Topology does not deal with dimension or distance. Pure geometry. Not even
affine or anything. As I've seen them defined, geodesics do not necessarily
mean the shortest path but rather the shortest path based on local
knowledge. I.e. if you have a wormhole in general relativity, the possible
shortcut does not affect the definition of geodesics in any way. You
calculate the geodesic based on the local curvature measure of the space,
that's it.

@_subject: CDR: Re: Minesweeper and defeating modern encryption technology 
You are talking about two very different problems, here. Gödel/Turing sorta
things are about problems where quantifiers over an infinite set are
permitted. Gödel is about verifying a given formula for all natural numbers
(a countable infinity), Turing about deciding whether any given algorithm
(there are a countable infinity of these) halts. An instance of SAT, on the
other hand, quantifies only over a sequence of fixed length vectors of truth
values (the list of all the possible combinations of truth values to be
assigned to the variables of the boolean function being tested). If you
think of these vectors as binary words, there are always a finite number of
these. This number is exponential in the number of variables of the
function. So a valid exp-time algorithm to solve SAT is to list all the
possible combinations of input values to the multivariate boolean formula,
feed them through it (I seem to think that around n^2 time is needed for
this) and see whether one of them really satistified it.
The latter strategy does not work for Turing/Gödel-kinda situations because
the computation would not halt, regardless of the function chosen. It is easy to see that the logic structure of Gödel's and Turing's theorem is far
deeper than that of SAT, while SAT is the only one which admits any kind of
computational complexity analysis.

As for what this means purely within our hypothetical world of absolute

for survival. It is never in the best interest of the owner to kill the
dependent one, just to extort him/her. I perceive this as a very concrete threat to liberty.

How about trying to automate this process? Using the remailer IPs and
possibly some others as well known geographical 'beacons' and utilizing
routing aggregation to get parts of the address space that are sure to be
close to the remailer and hence 'dangerous'. I think geographical
information at the level of nations is at least somewhat reflected in the
allocation of IP addresses - it wouldn't seem sensible to allocate IP
addresses for two different countries from a single pool.
And pass those that are known to be in the same.
If this sort of egress filtering (or any variant of the original scheme

acknowledge the limitations of a given remailer. Type 2 remailers even have
the necessary public key infrastructure in place to sign such extra data.

On a similar vein, just about every somehow understandable version of free
market theory is based on the assumption of a steady state market. The
theory does not include a temporal element. If you want to study those,
you're bound for such a quagmire of stochastic nonlinear differential
equations that you would not believe. Hence, the global stability of any
reasonably realistic model of markets is practically impossible to
guarantee with current mathematical tools. It is quite possible for such
systems to behave badly enough to kill most of the participants in the
market, for instance. Besides, the basic continuity assumptions behind
mathematical economics practically guarantee that the theory does not take
such possibilities seriously - I know of no models which take into account
the discrete, limited number of people participating in the market.
Free market theory, though interesting, useful and absolutely much better
than most available alternatives simply does not cover it all. It is an

I freely admit that I have absolutely no authority over things economic. But
I do think you too have an overly simplified view of the theory - you do not
seem to distinquish between the derivation of some of the parameters (e.g. price) of a dynamic system which is assumed to be in equilibrium based
on known ones (e.g. measures of/related to demand, availability etc.) from
actually working with the time evolution of the system (none of the
variables are known a priori and the solution consists of complete time
For instance, in the basic example given above - price formation of a single
good in an ideal closed market (i.e. given the normal assumptions of
independence of participants, continuity of variables, perfect knowledge and
so on) - can you cite a single understandable source with the rigorous
derivation of bounds for over/undershoot in price upon rapid fluctuation in
supply? Indeed, even if we assume no stochastic element is present, I think
this is a scenario in which solutions can be found which are far from
optimal in the sense of stable state theory.
When you refer to my ignorance, you perhaps mean that the above situation
has in fact been rigorously analyzed. I've never claimed otherwise. The

your average math graduate and it produces results which have little to do

None. But I think both terms are easily misunderstood - in most cases we can
analyze the local time behavior of differential equations based on steady
state assumptions. However, global properties of the system, like
unconditional stability, cannot. I think most of what a layperson knows
about economics is based on the former while the latter is a specialty to
chaos theorists.
Cellular automata are nice and well understood. But isn't this quite a leap
from analytic treatment to the direction of numerical simulation? Not that

Of course. I'm just saying that most people, including many with extensive

sophistication to say *anything* about the long term dynamic behavior of
economic systems even when the human and stochastic elements are abstracted
away completely. So, there are few absolutes in economics.
You do not understand my point. Human factors are something which,
naturally, cannot be predicted. But even if we model humans as, basically,
automata, and impose severe conditions on their behavior, we are *still*
left with a system which is exceedingly difficult to analyze globally. Hence
the scarcity of stability and optimality proofs and even reasonable bounds
on the expected behavior of global variables.
The fact is that people on this list often use aggressive market economic
arguments while discussing proposed social reforms. Now, if there is any

Quite. However, there are some things that must be considered if we're

deterministic Turing machine does not always bound the complexity of a

matching algorithms, for instance, can be proved to be in Theta(n log
n) if only binary comparison is used even while solutions exist in Theta(n
(log n)^a) with a less than 1 when the full ordering properties of the
problem can be exploited. That is the sort of stuff which makes one wonder

As a matter of fact, marker data is quite enough for that sort of

easier than the ones encountered in shotgun sequencing, which seem to be
well managed nowadays. Once sequence data is available, I'm quite sure it
is possible to reconstruct the genome of past generations of Icelanders upto
considerable accuracy - random mutations in the timespan considered are
negligible and more overlapping information (multiple children by a single
parent) is available in the older generations. Perhaps Gattaca wasn't so far

In a society where a significant part of an individual's life is spent
nonproductively and high productivity generally means high education and
learned skills, extension of the individual's life significantly beyond the
time required to learn these skills is a must in order for the average
individual to break even with the cost of education and upbringing. Of
course, this perhaps does not imply care of the elderly. This is not at
issue here.
Quite. I argue that should hold beyond their individual capability to pay
for the care.
How is this? If the premise holds, it is beneficial to make health care
ubiquitously available. This cannot be achieved if some people are allowed
to opt out of the gamble.
Which is pretty much what I'm after.
It is far more effective to not put money into their sustenance early on.
By making sure the people are completely dependent on the state, probably
through some pretty unfair engineering of contracts you cannot avoid if you

Which is precisely why there is no reason these people should not have their
insurance at precisely the same rate as everybody else - you cannot foresee
whether any particular individual will get the disease. What can you say,
it's unfair and I hold fairness in high regard. In addition, I'm certainly
not saying we should make this happen legislatively. I just think people
should boycott unfair insurance companies and perhaps shun their clientele
and employees for behaving badly. Maybe refuse to treat them when they have
a stroke...
Here the concept of variable rates based on belonging to risk groups is, if
not unheard of, nevertheless much rarer than in the States. Hence, I see no
value in the parallel.
And my counter is, why do you think equal cost of health care is in any way
'additional'? I do think the end justifies the means.
It's really too bad they didn't know what sort of business they were getting
into when they started...
They should have made damn sure genetic defects are rare...
Not true, if the company only controls part of the market - in this case the

Of course. Just as there is anandamide, the transmitter which hemp compounds
mainly mimic. Only you do not easily get such substances into the brain
without using a needle - proteins generally do not get through the
blood-brain barrier absent active transport. So you would need proteins
which, after somehow having been delivered in the blood stream whole, are
actively transported (this means extra 'handles' so that the molecule is
recognized) across the barrier, then we probably need a working mechanism
which then processes (cleaves, oxidises etc.) to obtain a final active
compound. All in all, you do not easily deliver proteins to the brain.

Actually I think that the post about THC producing oranges is a bit far
flung. From what I know about THC, it's pretty far from a protein, which are
the only things produced under the control of a single gene. I also think
that oranges are not very close relatives of hemp, so it is unlikely that
close enough precursors to THC would be present to enable us to produce THC
with the addition of a single enzymatic cleavage stage or some such simple
step. And from what I know about genetic technology, it isn't quite on the
level of enabling complicated (i.e. considerably more than a single
gene) biochemical syntheses to be transferred from species to species. In a
word, I think the magic oranges might be legend. Of course, there might be
shortcuts - instead of using recombinant DNA techniques, we could perhaps
try to get cells with both orange and hemp cellular nuclei to divide. I
don't think either of these particular plants is prone to accepting such a
treatment (unlike, I think, rye).

I do not agree. I think shunning harms you regardless, if it is organized
well enough. Say, you do something which causes your whole town to shun
you. Where do you suppose you get food, shelter, whatever from there
on? You'd say 'just leave', here, right? What if you do not have the
means? You just die?
I also think I'm not totally wrong if I claim that even when the physical
necessities of life have been taken care of, social contact *can* be
essential to the survival of people raised up to be/genetically predisposed
to being social or dependent, as modern people tend to be, on the
surrounding society for survival. If this holds, shunning someone then
becomes precisely as 'violent' as physical violence. Even if psychology
isn't the hardest of sciences, it does suggest that isolation does
significantly more than simply 'bug' people.
I doubt that. Besides, that someone can be offended all s/he wants, s/he
just shouldn't be allowed to do anything about it. (Except, of course, what
the freedoms of expression/thought/association/whatever guarantee.)
I don't see it quite like that. In order to have meaningful freedoms one
needs to have the possibility of enjoying them. When someone claiming
their rights in so doing limits the rights of others, I tend to resolve the
conflict by limiting the rights themselves. In this case, demanding that
people indeed 'play nice'.
This is precisely why freedom of thought and expression are so important and
why they are usually thought of as inalienable - thoughts do not usually
just jump out and start killing people. They are easy to protect since
conflicts between other people's similar rights rarely arise. This is not
the case with liberties involving physical violence, property et cetera.
(Really, this is simply the age old debate about positive liberties as
opposed to negative ones. In other words, a can of worms. Should we close it
before more nasty things crawl out?)
I agree. But the way I see it, tolerance applies to the intangible side of
things, not the physical. I.e. you can hate and insult the somali or the
Finnish all you want and webcast as much hate speech as you want but once
you start beating people, you're off. Similarly, you have to tolerate the
speech but not the actions. In the case of our proverbial lesbians, you have
to tolerate their 'deviant ways' and even the occasional kiss, while they
have to tolerate you speaking behind their back, insulting them and whatever
else nasty you can do with ideas alone. What you do not have to tolerate is
a lesbian kissing you (a bit of a bad analogy since you're male), or a shop
owner throwing you out for a public display of love.
The argument of private vs. public services, I think, is a bad one - in a
society in which practically everything can be privately owned it puts the
rights of everybody in the hands of those with the dough. Against this
background your view of rights being absolute sort of dries up.
Of course one valid attempt at resolving the problem would be to limit
private ownership of things somehow essential to the preservation of
people's liberties. I think I better not go there, right?

In my mind, that is a rather fine line.
True, provided you endow an owner with such rights. I'm not ready to do
that offhand - I have a rather more fine grained view of property rights
which distinquishes the right to ownership per se, the ability to profit
from the property, the ability of others to utilize the property (without
diminishing its value to the owner) and any extra obligations which come
with any given type of property (like fairness of utilization in certain
situations). Those distinctions come in very handy when talking about
intellectual property rights (and especially their abolition). But let's
stop this line of discussion here. Here we obviously have such a basic
difference in viewpoint that it probably cannot be reconsiled without considerable bloodshed.
Actually I'm thinking more in terms of the society instead of the state. But
I agree. Forcing (in)action at gunpoint is something I find repulsive
regardless of who's behind the piece.
I do. I just don't trust that individuals can look out for their rights as
easily as you do. That may have something to do with my Finnish
background. (Finland, in my mind, is a fair, sufficiently rational, and
remarkably open one but also one of the more intrusive. It's also subject
to the dreaded regulatory bloat. EU also adds its complications.) This seems
like a difference in viewpoint over the preferred role of individuals
vis-a-vis groups in the maintenance of liberties.
I know and agree. But OTOH, we do have the opposite thing happening for
religious/moral/ideological reasons in your Bible Belt, in European Neo-Nazi
circles and alike. The problem is that while most liberal ideas go hand in
hand with economic theory, the fundamental assumptions of the latter do not
always apply when we look at social phenomena. Economic models are also
steady-state or asymptotic ones, which means that the slow or uncertain
temporal evolution of markets doesn't always form an acceptably stable basis
for social practices. The Great Depression gives a first class example of
how market economy can occasionally bifurcate even when in theory the system
has a nice stable point. Conditioning basic liberties on like systems isn't
always a good idea, then. But I do admit that the basic reasoning is sound
and that aiming for liberties through emergence instead of regulation is the

A distinction without a difference, I say.
I think it is a workable argument that it is better to have such social
rules encoded in law instead of having people come up with them at will and
imposing them on others through shunning, lynching or whatever. In theory at
least you will then know in advance whether something you have done will be
'illegal'. Besides, current law in most countries holds precisely that sort
of stuff. Probably the best Finnish example is conscript duty. (No, I'm not
saying that isn't nightmarish.)
anarchy, injustice and immorality as long as the particular set of rules
leading to them is the one you approve of. This doesn't lead anywhere.
The dictionary definition is simply one end of a whole spectrum. Besides, if
I wanted to nitpick, the Webster definition, 'Exempt from subjection to the
will of others' strictly interpreted sort of rules out shunning and other
forms of extortion.
Let the part of population be those that own farming land. Let x be farming
You agree, then?
Who said you had any in the first place? That is something you have to
justify separately.
Do the honors.
Which some people could consider odd in the extreme. I do not take such
things for granted.
If we look at specific applications (like mobile data transfer), we would
like to use bands which are below 1-2 GHz because line-of-sight
communications limit the usability of any equipment. We would like to get by
with a minimum investment of physical resources, implying large coverage for
a single antenna installation. In metropolitan areas, this hardly suffices
for high bandwidth applications alone - nothing left over. This is what a
sane person would do provided no scarcity exists. Now consider what happens
when two independent parties do this in the same city. A mess. There is
considerable scarcity.
But if you acknowledge the existence of shared resources, you will have to
explain why, for instance, food, services, whatever really, aren't shared
but private.
Explain. This simply does not follow from the above. In the above situation
the existence of a right demands less than in your ideal universe.
No. I mean what I say - the specific set of behaviors which have to be
tolerated even though they infringe on your rights is to a degree arbitrary and subject to change. It's a gray area and should be left as such. There
will always be such a gray area, though. E.g. you cannot expect to shut
people up based on the acoustics of their speech violating your right to be
left alone. Not even when you have no way to escape the sound.
A hypothetical: I own everything around you for some 100 miles. Let's say
that 100 miles happens to be desert. Your failure to comply with my wish of
transportation the hell out of there or sustain me is equivalent to killing
me. I call such incompliance oppression. Webster for oppression: 'To impose
excessive burdens upon; to overload; hence, to treat with unjust rigor or
with cruelty'.
Webster for 'exploit': 'To utilize; to make available; to get the value or
usefulness out of; as, to exploit a mine or agricultural lands; to exploit
public opinion'. I'm not talking about satisfying whims, but basic needs. If
you have in your power to fulfill such a need, I cannot myself, and I will
be rid of a fundamental right (like the right to life) otherwise, you should
satisfy the need. If you take this as a premise, as I try to, not complying
fits the above description.
Who said anything about a government. Or all-powerful. Who said anything
about forcing (persuasion can have equivalent results, as the Drug War
demonstrates). What I'm talking about is oppression by majorities, which can
very well happen with or without a government.
Webster: 'The state of a free person; exemption from subjection to the
will of another claiming ownership of the person or services; freedom; --
opposed to slavery, serfdom, bondage, or subjection.' Nothing here to
suggest certain limitations cannot be made.
In my books, freedom/liberty also does not equal the right to limit other's
respective freedoms/liberties. Both words are defined as the absence of a
condition which in all practical situations to so degree applies. They
cannot be interpreted absolutely.
You will also have a lot of explaining to do if you assume that those who
have automatically deserve to. I'm not going to turn Marxist on you, here,
but I consider inequality something that should be limited (though not

And if your neighbours are simply malignant? Since when did people need a
reason to harm each other?
Yep. That would be my point. This sounds deceptively like holding someone at
a gunpoint. It has little to do with liberty.
Well, just debunk it. The point was, really, that even while I do have great
reservations about treating shunning and physical violence as equivalent, I
do not accept the notion of specific liberties being absolute, either.
Nor do I intend to. The point about shunning is simply about laying out some
of the well known problems of thorough libertarianism. I do not think such a
wide application of basic freedoms is automatically the best alternative.
There is no essential reason why those freedoms couldn't be defined in some
more limited form. It's not like these concepts are black and white.
Perhaps. Just as we force people not to do some things, like engage in
physical violence. If we give people full control over all aspects of their
association and on any conduct on their property, as you would probably
like, you will most likely end up with the same restrictions (or even more),
only this time enforced by way of lynch mobs.
Look at it this way: if for some reason the survival of each and every human
being is conditioned on some part of the population doing thing x, wouldn't
you say it is fair to demand that x be done even if the individuals would
not want to? It's not a huge leap from this to limiting such 'inalienable'
rights as the right to property.
Not really. I have no essential trouble giving certain parts of my freedoms
away if that gains me the actual possibility of applying the remaining
parts. And yes, this is the point where you cue in the talk about expanding
governments, Big Brothers and whatnot.
Free as in having certain freedoms, which in this case have been more
narrowly tailored. Besides, I've not quite committed to actually advocating
such a model, yet. I'm just asking questions.
If we, for some reason, have an (in)action, some damage and a strong proof
of causality, it is difficult to justify differential treatment based on
whether the damage comes from action or inaction. And as for *your own
property*, it simply isn't given that 1) all things can/should be privately
owned (scarce resources, like the radio spectrum, are a classical
example) or 2) owning certain things or using them in certain ways shouldn't
perhaps come with extra obligations (like using RF communication with extra
responsibilities to minimize interference).
Some of the above, perhaps. If people are indeed dependent on shopping for
their survival, I do think their right to live sort of preempts the shop
owner's property rights.
Those are particulars of the social contract in effect in the corresponding
society. They need not be universal.
That is an extremely good question. In fact a central one to liberal theory.
I most certainly do not have an answer.
So, essentially, if somebody can oppress others, why not? Especially if
there's profit or fun to it? Again this has little to do with liberty as I
understand the concept.
But even when you're *real* nice to them, they still have the incentive to
exploit you. If you go this way, all the nice talk about liberties and
freedom don't matter squat. Could you explain how this differs from fascism?
They got limited. That is what happens when you live in a society. Whoever said life is fair?

Shunning is rarely a problem if it's not concerted. Then it can be a great
problem indeed. If, and only if, it is, you have harm to the basic rights of
a person and you can establish causality, we are on a fine line. I *am*
sensible enough not to confuse satisfying arbitrary whims with e.g. keeping
someone alive.

This sort of highlights how the current models of shared code fail. A good
deal of modularity and independence of cryptography implementations (what
Tim probably drives at with his comment of making life too easy for Three
Letter Agencies) could be achieved with proper shared libraries with well
thought out APIs. Only DLLs and alike aren't quite stable enough to be used
for such heavy inter-vendor use. If they were, the massive single function
apps could be implemented as lighter wrappers around them and modularity
would be maintained, all without compromising ease of use. There would be
security considerations in using someone else's library, yes, but a proper
authentication architecture and/or open source development could be used to
alleviate those. Too bad M$ does not place a lot of weight on such design
considerations, instead pushing its own centralized model.

I.e. you both evaluate actions as such, I tend to evaluate them based on
their consequences.
[Snip on intrusiveness of regulation of action and inaction]
I know and I appreciate the viewpoint in question. I raised some mild doubts
about it and apparently have to bear the consequences, now...
I do not see the essential difference. I see that as an axiom which need not
hold. OTOH, no point in debating axioms...
Actually I subscribe to neither view. I see rights as something that do not
naturally exist, but are purely a societal product, subject to change
through redefinition. Whether this happens because the government effects it
or if the people start to view something as an inherent right is, to me, immaterial. I also have trouble with argumentation which starts from a clean
slate, since such a thing does not exist in reality.
If everybody around you decides your shop is now a shared resource, it will
be, by your definition. Since I view rights as highly relative, you cannot
even call this thievery.
If you do not define commerce as a shared resource, which in some cases just
might be sensible.
Because I evaluate based on the outcome. In the first case, the sound bugs
you if it bugs you. (And yes, in some cases the damage could be enough to
regulate the speech. This is, thankfully, rare.) In the second case you
die. There is a conflict of interests and I rank. Admittedly you could place
the value of the right to exist below that of not having to listen to
someone and resolve this particular problem. I think it would be problematic
Yep, this is the difference in viewpoint. I do not view regulation of
inaction as fundamentally different from the regulation of action, relying
instead on the consequences of each to resolve possible conflicts. Perhaps
we will get to burying this thread before I acquire the reputation of being
a troll beyond rescue...
And again. I am, under some circumstances, ready to regulate inaction
whereas you are not.

Oh but it is quite possible to put people in similar trouble if we grant
that the right to property is absolute - if somebody owns on a sufficiently

(like fresh water, farming land, employment opportunities), others are born
right in the middle of the proverbial desert.

Quite right. In addition to this, the data used to triangulate a phone
usually originates in the phone itself - GSM phones periodically transmit
field strength measurements to the base station of all the cells they hear.
This is the basis of normal triangulation, as most GSM networks do not have
a triangulation capability built in.
