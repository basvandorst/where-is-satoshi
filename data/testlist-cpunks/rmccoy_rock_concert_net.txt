It's still PGP.EXE. They suggest installing in a directory named VPGP, but
the executable and all other files have the same name as Free PGP. Also,
PGPPATH etc. are the same.

There was mention on this list, some time ago, of a 1-900 number which
could be used to ensure non-tracibility. Does anyone have this number?
