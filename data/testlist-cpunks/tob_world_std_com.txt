Actually, this was hashed out a long time ago on the late, lamented
news.future. I'm pleased to see ideas I fought for coming to life again.
Moderation could easily fit in. A moderation-stamp would be just one
more field for the search to work with. Someone (I think it was me but
it's been years since all this was said!) speculated that this would
actually be an improvement in several ways:
* If rejected messages were indicated by simply missing a signature of
approval, voluntary not searched for by individual readers, it would be
harder to claim moderator censorship. Or to accomplish it, for that
* Multiple independent moderators could work on the same newsgroup.
* If the stamp of approval were dissociated from the message proper,
messages could propagate without waiting for the moderator's
receive-email-and-post cycle. The moderator's "OK" would catch up later,
for those readers that wait for it.
Imminent resurrection of Usenet predicted. Film-teaser at 5.

This seems more a case of "the border is at the river" than Schelling
Points. The river is the border because it hard to cross (harder than
dry land), not because it is easy to see.

That doesn't really do it. In fact, I'm not sure why you move in this
direction at all. No offense.
Seems to me that voter registration of some kind must be UNanonymous. I
want to have confidence that my empowered political opponents aren't
voting 10,000 times each.
It also seems to me that if the entire system is the government's
black-box, there is no anonymity. It is a trustworthy as the government
itself. At worst, if they want to know how you voted, they can sum all
votes, then sum all votes but yours, then subtract.
Seems to me that the best thing would be a system where you the voter
pick who is to handle your vote, in a sort of hierarchical tree. Each
level has the same goal as a DC net, to make it difficult to tell who
among many people communicated, and further levels confuse which group
did, and which group-of-groups did, and so forth.
Each group delivers its collected votes, publicly but unidentified, to a
group-of-groups, and watches that groups' output. Obviously you would
use multiple envelopes to prevent premature disclosure.
At each level, you need to be able to identify your own vote and check
that it is unaltered, but no-one else should be able to associate it to
you. This assumes that there is no way for anyone to see you looking for
your own ballot, which is a separate facet of the problem.
Everyone needs to be able to see that the collected votes did not exceed
the number of voters that group has.
This is pretty simple and requires a fair bit of collaboration to
defeat. But it can be partially defeated by partial collaboration and
the rest guessed from parallel voting patterns. If your entire group is
seen to vote the same way, your vote among them is obvious.

@_subject: Twenty Bank Robbers -- Game theory:) 
What the 20 Cypherpunk Bankrobbers do, aside from writing "Memo: Need
better loot-division scheme. *URGENT*."
Assume every player acts completely rationally, and unwaveringly trusts
every other player to fully understand the situation and act solely to
maximize their profit in this single situation.
Also assume that each player announces an immutable, unconditional
monetary distribution before anyone has voted, and the announced
distribution constitutes the whole of the payoff (no way to make or
enforce promises, no external loyalties, no side payments, etc.)
Also assume no revolt against the rules is possible.
Every proposer makes the most profitable deal for himself that will pass
the vote, if they can predict it (As it happens, they always can with
one exception, see below)
Every player, when voting, compares what he is offered right now with
what he will be offered between now and the first guaranteed successful
He inspects the future possibilities and sees that the next offerer can
make a successful proposal if they (the player) vote down the current
proposal, and if his vote is needed this time, it will not be needed for
the next offer to succeed. (You can check this assumption below).
So he sees no reason to hope for a better result by voting against
apparently favorable offers.
If we were to keep the condition that all other things being equal,
players vote for the other players to live, the proposer always keeps
the *entire* amount.
If a player expects to be offered no money next time, it makes no sense
to offer him anything this time, because you've got his vote for sure
anyways (nice guys finish last). Working backwards, once a player will
be shut out in the future, it never makes sense to cut him in.
In fact, for each player it makes sense to some proposer to shut him
out. The guy next in line will never vote for the proposer to live, so
is always shut out. So nobody but the proposer expects any money and
everybody but the guy next in line votes for the proposer to live.
So instead I'm going to assume that if a player does not do *better*
than he will next time, he votes against the proposer.
The result is that the first player not only lives, but makes out like a
bandit, to the extent that the loot is subdividable. If there were 40
million and 1 guys in line, he'd be meat. Likewise, if the money was all
in $2,500,000 notes he should start framing his last words.
I'm going to write it in reverse order, where  is the last guy,  is
second to last, etc. because it's easier to see the progression that
1 Player:
     everything
    Voting for:     Trivially succeeds 1/1
2 players:
     nothing
     Everything
    Voting for:     Succeeds 1/2
3 players:
     $.01
     nothing
     Everything else.
    Voting for:      Succeeds 2/3
4 players:
       $.01
        nothing
       Everything else.
    Voting for:      Succeeds 2/4
5 players:
      nothing
      $.01
     Everything else.
    Voting for:       Succeeds 3/5
6 players:
          $.01
       nothing
     Everything else
    Voting for:       Succeeds 3/6
The other cases proceed similarly, grouping even/odd. In the end, the
guy at the head of the list offers every other guy a penny and keeps the
rest -- and then starts to sweat as he wonders whether our assumption of
perfect rationality will hold up in real life.
Paul Foley nearly got it, but it does matter who is offered money. If it
didn't, then nobody could count on doing worse on the next proposal.
The case where the proposer does not get a vote is completely different:
1 Player:
     everything
    Voting for:
    Vote is indeterminate 0/0
    Player seals himself into a box with the money, Schroedinger's cat,
    and a vial of poison that has a 50% chance of being shattered.
Everything that follows depends on how we resolve that case. If we
assume some probability mixture of money & death, it is not given how to
weight the player's negative payoff (death) vs positive payoff (money).
Let's assume Schroedinger's player gets all the money and is not
required to suicide.
2 players:
     Everything
     nothing
    Voting for:
    Fails 0/1
Remember the assumption that if a player does not do *better*, he votes
against the proposer. This is a null move since the outcome is the same
as above.
3 players:
     nothing
     $.01            (or nothing)
     Everything else
    Voting for:     Succeeds 1/2
Note that we assumed that  requires strictly more money than he would
otherwise be offered (His life means nothing to him). Otherwise he would
be offered $0. (Yeah, I don't want to rewrite the analysis just for
that). It would end up with the same pattern, though, just faster.
4 players:
     $.01
     $.02            (or $.01)
     nothing
     Everything else
    Voting for:      Succeeds 2/3
That fact that the proposer cannot vote means he needs to pick up an
extra vote. He can't get it from the guy who would get almost
everything, and a penny secures the vote of the player who would get
nothing. So he has to offer the player who would get $.01 the next
increment of money. If  valued his life, he'd be offered $.01 instead.
5 players:
     $.02
     nothing         (or group  interchangeably)
     $.01
     nothing
     Everything else
    Voting for:      Succeeds 2/4
...leaving the next (previous) proposer a similar position.
6 players:
     nothing
     $.01            (or group  interchangeably)
     $.02
     $.01
     nothing
     Everything else
    Voting for:       Succeeds 3/5
7 players:
     $.01
     ?
     nothing
     ?
     $.01
     nothing
     Everything else
    Voting for:   ?
    Succeeds 3/6
For the first time here, one of the proposers has an arbitrary decision.
He has  and  and he needs to pick up one more vote. He can't do it
for $.01 and there are two ways to do it for $.02.
We would have encountered this situation earlier if  valued his life.
Here we have to add some notation to indicate a non-determinate
distribution over a set:
(set): (non-zero payoffs, all others are 0) average
7 players:
     $.01
    ( ($.02) average $.01
     nothing
     $.01
     nothing
     Everything else
    Voting for:   ( or     Succeeds 3/6
8 players:
     ?
    ( ?
     $.01
     ?
     $.01
     nothing
     Everything else
    Voting for:   ?, ?
    Succeeds 4/7
The proposer easily gets  and  and needs two more votes.  can't be
reached. The rest all have an expected payoff of $.01, so he gives $.02
to any two of them. Our indeterminate-list seems to be growing.
8 players:
    (   ( 2 x $.02) average $.01
     $.01
     $.01
     nothing
     Everything else
    Voting for:   2 of (      Succeeds 4/7
9 players:
    (      ( 3 x $.02) average $.01
     $.01
     nothing
     Everything else
    Voting for:  3 of (         Succeeds 4/8
The indeterminate-list has now swallowed up everything but the last 3
players and will continue to do so because the average payoff to the
list is always more than $.01 and less than $.02.
10 players:
    (       ( 4 x $.02) average $.08/7
     $.01
     nothing
     Everything else
    Voting for:  4 of (          Succeeds 5/9
Another set of assumptions is that the players do not trust each other
to be rational or to see all outcomes. In this case, the guy at the head
of the line says in a loud voice to the guy behind him: "Whoever would
vote to kill me even though I offer them money would vote to kill you
too even if you split the money with them, so if it gets to you you
should cut out anyone who got my money but voted to kill me, but keep
those who got my money and voted to keep me alive."
He then allocates equal portions to half the group, including himself
and not including the guy behind him. He probably lives.

It's too bad you received such fingers-in-the-ears libertarian-scream
responses to this. You deserved a better answer than that. Not that I
entirely agree. Let me quote part of something I once wrote on
essentially this topic:
"With *real* insurance it's tough enough to root out fraud. How can an
unwritten, virtual policy, knowable only through deduction, addressing
our entire circumstances of birth, that the insured may deny contracting
to or may disagree about what the terms were, be easy to sort out?"
