wild and crazy ideas for the remailers:
o  some fabulous code writer needs to hack up a copy of PGP so that it will
   allow/force a batch-mode operation and not stop and wait for input from
   the "user" if the message fed into it uses an unknown key or something
   else happens that causes PGP to pause/stop/halt/quit/die.
       " ::            "
   the " PGP-ENCRYPTED "  line could be done away with all together.
   if the message fed through the PGP.batch.version returns a plaintext,
   use the plaintext; if not, try to process the original message.
o  i looked at the code for hal-the-remailer for about 5 seconds and can't
   remember even a line of what it looked like, but how difficult would it
   be to rig up the remailers to delay untill midnight and then process
   each message stacked in the remailer que _randomly_?
   1 out of 3 it is sent out
   1 out of 3 it is skipped entirely (until the next remailing-event/time)
   1 out of 3 it is forwarded automagicly through a "friendly" remailer.
   you set the remailer to NOT skip a message that is in the first "n"
   messages on the stack to be remailed. (to prevent a message from getting
   "stuck" inside the remailer for an extended period of time...)
   obviously whomever is running the remailer can tinker with the ratios
   and the number of times per day messages are processed ...
o  the more remailers the message goes through, the harder it is to
   track down the original sender. why force the sender to manually
   send messages through multiple remailers when some clever script
   can do it from inside the "remailer network" automaticly?
   messages go into one remailer, and are forwarded in a random order
   once/twice/? a day through a second remailer. encryption, compression,
   padding, etc would add to the effect as well.
o  how about checking for " ::      "
                          " Respond "
   and bouncing back: " Message received. "
                      " ReMailer active.  "
   or perhaps the remailer's public key, or even a description of the
   location of the system the remailer is running on, how to get a copy
   of the software, what the author's favorite color is, etc ...
   anyone that wants the remailer to bounce back a response can stick
   "::RESPONDDAMNIT!" in their messages, and the people who don't want
   the remailers to respond at all, won't hafta worry about it.
o  i suggest adding an "ignore list" of sites.
   this would provide a simple somewhat effective way to cut down on
   abuse with a minimum effort. if a problem-abuser pops up, just lock
   that site out for a while and maybe the problem will go away.
   the amount of annoyance/difficulty the abuser is caused is much
   greater than the effort needed to add the site's name to the ignore
   list. sure the abuser will just find another site to send from or
   another remailer to abuse, but mr abuser will wear himself out while
   the remailers won't even break a sweat.
o  an overiding "OK-to-respond" list would be nice too.
   (to allow remailers to accept messages from certain systems, users,
    and remailers regardless of any locked out sites.)

fine. it was late. i wasn't thinking clearly. shut up. i don't wanna hear it.
this idea would work fine if you happen to have a clue where the hell the
abusive/annoying messages are comming from ...
how about just switching that around to be a "lock out these sites" list
and ignore all messages that ask to be remailed to those sites.
and be sure to stick "willy at whitehouse.gov" on the top of the list.

if every single site knows the final address, so what?
 how is this going to help them track down the original sender??
anyone at the final destination who wants to track down the original sender
would need to hop-scotch backwards through the numerous sites and try to
track down the path the message took. this is of course, IF someone really
wants to go to this much trouble and if they think they can talk a slew
of administrators into helping them with the witchhunt.
1 out of 5 odds that a "special processing script" is executed on the
message and it is forwarded through a remailer or two using encryption.
 just set up 20 different scripts that route the message in encrypted form
through various/random/secret/obscure remailer-paths.

in the "PC" world, look for DISKREET (with Norton's Utilities).
it simple, "Stacker"-like, and user friendly.
it seems to offer "feeble DES"
              and "even more feeble DES"
it's speed is almost negligable when in use.
 (which doesn't say very much for the "stength" of the encryption.)
anyone ever thought of taking a "software MNP" program
and creating a "V42enc" software modem protocol?
auto-generate unique/random keys after the connection is etablished,
allow for "re-training" the connection by generating/switching to a new
key. maybe re-train every "set number of seconds" ...
pick a "fast" encryption method, and a RSA public key length that is
proportional to the strength of the encryption, and have at it.
talk about "just like uncle sam does it!" ...
If the NSA is paranoid over PGP, what will they think of plug in pirate
PROMS for USR Couriers that will create obscenely secure connections?
 (although the encrypted connections might not fly along at full speed,
  that tis but a small price to pay...)

colorful Norton style pop up windows, and you can probably find a copy
at Wallmart. I'm not saying it's great, just that it's out and about.
 (I played with it for a while and decided that it wasn't any more
  secure than putting passwords on a ZIP file, so i dumped it.)
i would be thrilled to play around with something more "secure".
 (ie: my mailbox can handle whatever you wanna send to it.)

the $300 14k Couriers are supposed to be able to upgrade to V.FAST with
a simple chip upgrade. ie: they can have a fast-fancy-processor.
wouldn't life be easier trying to design a software version rather that
trying to figure out how to code for a funky USR processer?
 (i doubt they would be thrilled about sending you docs ...)
besides, if someone is willing to pay $300 for a Courier, they would be
just as willing to pay for some black-market UncleSam encryption modem.
I've seen multiple versions of programs that will do a perfect emulation
of MNP protocols, and if someone could dig up some source code you could
swap all the "compression" routines with "encryption" routines.
 (of course, since MNP is probably patented by [go figure] MNP,
  you would need to mutate it [PGPstyle:] to dodge lawsuits.)
maybe design the software to accept input from one port and output
to another and then set up stone age PC's as secure-phone-hubs and route
communications through them ... maybe some self booting EPROMs ...
 (a $50 286/20 or a $300 modem? not a tricky decision.)
i guess i better subscribe to that hardwarepunks list then, eh?
 (someone send me the address; i didn't write it down.)

The EPCA applies to Common Carriers.  Thus it applies to Compuserve, MCI Mail,
etc.  It does not apply to bulletin boards unless they issue mail contracts.
what are the actual legal requirements for claiming status as a Common Carrier??  (other than being in the USA ...)
signed written agreements?
(this is the best "place" i could think of to ask this question...)
