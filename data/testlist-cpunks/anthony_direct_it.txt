You could try using SECURE Desk-Top. It can encrypt your hard drive using a symmetrical key. The algorithms are
DES and IDEA (128 bits). It's fast and you could choose exactly what part of
the drive to encrypt, whether just some files or the entire drive.
You can download the software from this url:
                All the best

Hi there
Should try SECURE DESK-TOP as well (PC only), it can encrypt (DES and IDEA)
any: - file - directory - groups of directories
- Hard Disk
- Floppy
- Removable drive
And it can add PEM capabilities to most e-mail clients and it's WIN95 and
user friendly. Try it at:
                There are NO export restrictions on it as well because it's Italian made.
