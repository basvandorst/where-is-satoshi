well, maybe we should update this measure to meet the range like they did with the bel.. since an encyclopedia per second (eps) is a useless measure, maybe we should institute the mega-encyclopedia per second, or `meps' which would be 1024x30volumes of text.. `this little number over here'll do 30 meps!'..
