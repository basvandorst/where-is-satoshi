It's not just a private interaction between two consenting parties.
It's a contract that grants power to a third party eliminating
traditional legal guarantees of quasi-privacy in communication from
sender to recipient, one of which is not a party to the contract.
There's no guarantee the average sender would know that mail to gmail is
intercepted and parsed.
