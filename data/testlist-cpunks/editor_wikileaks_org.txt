FYI: US Intelligence planned to destroy WikiLeaks
This document is a classifed (SECRET/NOFORN) 32 page U.S.
counterintelligence investigation into WikiLeaks. ``The possibility
that current employees or moles within DoD or elsewhere in the U.S.
government are providing sensitive or classified information to
Wikileaks.org cannot be ruled out''. It concocts a plan to fatally
marginalize the organization. Since WikiLeaks uses ``trust as a
center of gravity by protecting the anonymity and identity of the
insiders, leakers or whisteblowers'', the report recommends ``The
identification, exposure, termination of employment, criminal
prosecution, legal action against current or former insiders,
leakers, or whistlblowers could potentially damage or destroy this
center of gravity and deter others considering similar actions from
using the Wikileaks.org Web site''. [As two years have passed since
the date of the report, with no WikiLeaks' source exposed, it appears
that this plan was ineffective]. As an odd justificaton for the
plan, the report claims that ``Several foreign countries including
China, Israel, North Kora, Russia, Vietnam, and Zimbabwe have
denounced or blocked access to the Wikileaks.org website''. The
report provides further justification by enumerating embarrassing
stories broken by WikiLeaks---U.S. equipment expenditure in Iraq,
probable U.S. violations of the Cemical Warfare Convention Treaty
in Iraq, the battle over the Iraqi town of Fallujah and human rights
violations at Guantanmo Bay...
