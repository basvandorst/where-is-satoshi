I know this is a little off-topic, but does anyone know of a good swap file deleter?  I know Real Delete is a good program, but I want something I can call in a batch file after windows to automatically do a secure wipe of the permanent swap file and then replace it.  I have heard of a couple programs but I am not sure about their reliability.  Any pointers to a good program would be appreciated.
