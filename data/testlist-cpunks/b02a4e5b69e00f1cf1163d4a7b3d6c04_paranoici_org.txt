Who cares who sides with Al Qaeda?  They're not keeping track of their
sympathizers.  It's foreign policy change, social change ("reform"
perhaps?), and volunteers for martyrdom they want, not rhetorical
The WTC and the pentagon were specific, well-thought-out targets.  The
plane that crashed in PA was headed to the Capitol.  If you're so eager
to see Al Qaeda blow up better targets, why not suggest a few?
As everyone else pointed out, Even though the 9/11 attacks may not have
garnered your support, it accomplished other objectives.
