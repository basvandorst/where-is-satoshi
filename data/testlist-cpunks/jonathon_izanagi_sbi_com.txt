Okay, I'll go with that. I'd just like to point out that http (transport for documents serverd on the web) uses mime. That's how your browser knows something is html, or a picture of some format, or postscript. find a web server (pick one) and telnet to it:
% telnet my.web.server 80
enter the following line and press return *twice*
HEAD / HTTP/1.0
(you need the second line because the server is expecting a mime header from you - ended by a blank line).
You'll get some answer like:
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Server: NCSA/1.3
MIME-version: 1.0
Content-type: text/html
Last-modified: Tuesday, 06-Dec-94 06:10:37 GMT
Content-length: 1067
That's the server's answer to your query - one mime header (the http HEAD request asks for info about a document).
If you have a mailer that doesn't automagically verify signatures and pack and unpack pgp messages it's a pain (I know tim will agree with this). If you have a mailer that can't pack and unpack mime then it's a pain too. Just because your mailer doesn't support it doesn't mean that mime (or email privacy !) is a bad thing.
PS: for those with macs or pcs or unix machines don't have mime. please take a look at mpack - might find it usefull.

There is only ONE MIME - it's in the rfc (I've forgotten the number). If it's the same as the rfc - it's MIME. if it ain't then it aint MIME.
The sun stuff is a good example of how bad it can get. But it's not MIME. not mailtool anyway. It is a stinking pile of [insert expletive here]. But it's
not MIME.   j.fletcher at stirling.ac.uk

I've really been enjoying the traffic recently - this religious 'skirmish'
has generated nearly as much traffic as the Logo Wars. I do have my own
strong opinions about this particular subject, but I'm fighting back the
compulsion to fly, berserker like, into the fray. However, it might be
time to let it all lie for a while. This is, after all, a list for
cryptography. Users of all kinds/makes/manufacturers of computers need
good crypto software - so in that respect all contenders in this are equal. Ding Ding. Time out guys.
