@_subject: Urgent info re: your myspace InBox 
Dear Valued myspace Member,
As part of our ongoing efforts to provide users with quality products and services, myspace will be temporarily removing InBox from the myspace site.  We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you.  But, don't worry.  Inbox is not going away forever.  We will be reintroducing InBox in a short while as part of a premium myspace service that will include all of InBox's benefits, PLUS dedicated storage space and servers to ensure that our valuable customers receive the best service possible.
This change in service will take place in two phases.  1) Beginning on Friday, January 12, 2001, you will no longer be able to receive, send, or forward emails and files from your myspace InBox.  2) On Friday, January 26, 2001, we will be temporarily removing InBox from the myspace site.  As of this date, you will no longer be able to access or retrieve files or emails previously stored in your myspace InBox.  If you have files or emails in your InBox that you would like to use in the future, please move them into a folder within your myspace account or to another location prior to Friday, January 26, 2001.
Stay tuned for more news on the re-release of InBox and myspace premium services.
