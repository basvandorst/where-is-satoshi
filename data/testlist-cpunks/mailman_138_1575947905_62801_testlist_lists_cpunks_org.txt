@_subject: Access using a proxy <p> 
blocking 50% of the web. I was told by someone that you can unblock these web sites by using a proxy, but I don't know what that means. I am wondering is there a way to get access to these sites? -- A proxy is easy to use if you use someone elses, they can be tricky to setup yourself. I have had very good results with Surfola. Basically you surf to their servers and then from there you surf Through/From their servers. I have several places I surf from that block content. Surfola easily bypasses them! Its also Free! You can also make money with them but I just use them to bypass anal retentive ISP/Corporate providers and because they allow me to surf anonymously! I have a detailed right-up on them at   See there for more info. If anything is not clear feel free to ask.
