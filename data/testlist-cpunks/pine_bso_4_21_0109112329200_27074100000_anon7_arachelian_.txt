Then how come 84 unarmed people could not take aproximatly 4 people armed with razor blades.
Agh, I see it, they didn't have guns.  Shit 10 kids could probably rush and take an adult
armed with a knife, if they rushed him.  At least one terrorist was flying, so what thats
84 people against 3 armed with exacto razor blades?
Bullshit, they had knives and sharp instruments.  No matter how well
How about odds of 20 to 1 with the one having a knife....
