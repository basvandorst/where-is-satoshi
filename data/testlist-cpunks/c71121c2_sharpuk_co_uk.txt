The point is though, that according to C99 today
volatile int myflag;
if (myflag!=0) { do stuff } ;
does _exactly_ what you want, per the spec.  The only compilers that don't work this way are by definition out of spec, so adding new stuff isn't going to help.
Having said that, most of what your talking about pragma wise is boils down to controlling the optimizer.  Most compilers offer options to control this, but it's vendor specific.  I can see how adding this to the spec would be worthwhile.  But it's not essential to fix the problem above.
