No one is saying you have to use GPG.  The source code is freely available.  Anyone can take the algorithm it uses to analyze its input, and outputs whatever it outputs on STDERR when a non-encrypted message is detected, and incorporate it into their own software.  You can make it better, or different, or do whatever you feel like doing with it.
If some people decide to run remailers that only propagate email that looks encrypted based on GPG's algorithm for detecting encryption, more power to them.  If you don't want to use these remailers, you don't have to.
Yes, enhancing liberty is one useful reason to run or use a remailer.  If you don't like the ones that require incoming traffic to be encrypted, don't use them.  Run your own.  You'll get more spam complaints from end-recipients, but that's your problem.  Or use somebody else's.  There's no shortage of unrestricted remailers out there.
