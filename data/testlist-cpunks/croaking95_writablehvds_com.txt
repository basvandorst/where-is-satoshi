she'll be here friday and saturday april 3rd and 4th, and she'll be taking appointments for all day/ night both days at my house. she's cute
when you need to be home, may you find your way.
doesn't she look like lucy from chronicles of narnia? i am trying to be a patient, kind mom.
we ate corned beef and cabbage with irish soda bread last night in preparation for the day of the irish. ps- did i say i would sew this past saturday? i meant next saturday! haha!
ok, i'm off to knit...
i am blocking my two latest projects today and will show them tomorrow. and you eat with your sunglasses on
in a tiny town in idaho
interested? i think it would be so fun. you sit at the counter
i am looking forward to a date with grant.
i always enjoy knitting lacy stuff but this pattern was especially fun, super easy, and portable.
i am excited about my new running shoes.
