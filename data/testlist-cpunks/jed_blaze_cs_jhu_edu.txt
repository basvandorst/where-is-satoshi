: How about compiling it? THAT is "further processing"......
Perhaps...but I for one wouldn't trust anyone else to compile my copy
of PGP...would you?
And, note, it says sustantial change in value...I don't know if this is taken
to mean monetary, or usability...the later might work.  It's an interesting idea.

: After all - I don't read all the source code - do you?
You mean you don't?!!!
But seriously, I get it directly from MIT, check the checksums, etc.  I'm
pretty sure that it hasn't been tampered with.  And, actually, I've read
a good deal of the source code...especially the rsaref library.  Not cause
I'm paranoid, just interested.
If I get the source code from, say, my friend, who I trust, who got it from someone he trusted, and so on down the line, the line of trust falls into
question.  Who's to say someone doesn't like someone on that line, and
modifies the code...don't you have "friends" you don't like? :)

: So, pre-compile for a couple of architectures, and then
: slap them on a CD-ROM with source.  : Definite tangable value from the CD-ROM then.
