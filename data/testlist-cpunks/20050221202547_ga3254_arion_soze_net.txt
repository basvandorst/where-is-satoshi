Given the release of Palm Beach HIV+ patient information via
"accidental" attachment to a widely-distributed email, should agencies
with access to confidential information implement mandatory access
control and role-based security so that, barring problems with the
RBAC/MAC software, confidential data cannot be accessed by roles that
have external network access?
I haven't found the list yet, but I found this:
"In Palm Beach County, one of every 35 blacks is HIV-positive. That is
compared with one of every 492 whites."
