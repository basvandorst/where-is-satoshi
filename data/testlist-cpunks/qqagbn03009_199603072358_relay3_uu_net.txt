On the mailing list for the "Electronic Frontier Canada" (similar to, but
I won't repost the entire article here, but here are some highlights:
  - The system is initially intended to secure email between federal
    government employees.  Deployment is expected to begin next year.
  - Key management is decentralized; each department hands out its own keys.
  - Top-secret messages will be encoded using "palm-sized computer cards"
    (presumably some kind of PCMCIA device).
  - The Communications Security Establishment (~= NSA) helped to design
    the system, and claims that it's "more sophisticated than existing
    public versions".
    (This is the part that still worries me a bit, even though EFC's
    David Jones is quoted as saying that he has no concerns.  Will the
    algorithms be published?  Also, why develop a new, untested system --
    why not just buy the thing from RSA, Viacrypt, etc.?  Stay tuned...)
  - There's a great quote from Bob Little, deputy secretary of financial
    and information management for the Treasury Board:  "[The CSE] don't
    have access to the keys . . . and never will.  We did it to avoid
    the American experience with the Clipper Chip."
  - The RCMP (~= FBI) is not amused.
All in all, it sounds like a positive development for once.
