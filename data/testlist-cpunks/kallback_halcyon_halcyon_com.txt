@_subject: SAVE 50-90% ON INT'L LONG DIST-EVEN ON THE ROAD 
THE BEST WAY TO SAVE ON INTERNATIONAL LONG DISTANCE IS TO USE
KALLBACK is the original "call-back" service provider.  Kallback was specifically designed to save international businesses and frequent travelers 40%-90% on their international long distance.
How it works is very simple.  When you subscribe to Kallback, you receive a personal "trigger number."  When you want to make an international call, dial your trigger number and hang up after the first ring.  The Kallback computer will then call you back with a US dial tone, so instead of paying the  local telephone company's rates, you are billed at Kallback's, which are among THE LOWEST IN THE WORLD.
Because no outgoing call is ever completed, our customers who call from hotels DON'T HAVE TO PAY HOTEL TELEPHONE SURCHARGES.
It doesn't matter where you need to make a call from, because your location number can be changed at any time.  You can have the Kallback computer ask for you by name, by room number or both. You can even program in touch tones, so Kallback will work with your automatic phone answering system. Kallback also supports modems and fax machines.
To give an idea of the savings you will see with Kallback, compare the rates you are paying now to the following:
TO THE UNITED STATES FROM(per min in $US):
Australia 	$ .52
Canada		  .23
France   	  .49
India		 1.06
Japan		  .78
