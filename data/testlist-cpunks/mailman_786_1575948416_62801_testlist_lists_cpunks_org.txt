   [1]Roland Piquepaille writes "According to eWEEK, the National
   Security Agency (NSA) has [2]picked a commercial solution for its
   encryption technology needs, instead on relying on its own
   proprietary code. "The National Security Agency has purchased a
   license for [3]Certicom Corp.'s elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)
   system, and plans to make the technology a standard means of securing
   classified communications. In the case of the NSA deal, the agency
   wanted to use a 512-bit key for the ECC system. This is the
   equivalent of an RSA key of 15,360 bits." [4]This summary includes
   the NIST guidelines for public key sizes and contains more details
   and links about the ECC technology. Since [5]the announcement,
   Canadian Press reports that [6]Certicom's shares more than doubled in
   Toronto."
