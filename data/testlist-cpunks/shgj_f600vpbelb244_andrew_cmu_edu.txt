@_subject: More on remailers 
I wrote an automated script to ping the following remailers:
hfinney at shell.portal.com
catalyst at netcom.com
elee7h5 at rosebud.ee.uh.edu
nowhere at bsu-cs.bsu.edu
remailer at chaos.bsu.edu
hh at cicada.berkeley.edu
hh at pmantis.berkeley.edu
hh at soda.berkeley.edu
ebrandt at jarthur.claremont.edu
remailer at merde.dis.org
Results were a bit faster with the automated program than before:
Here they are:

Results seem to vary depending on current network load and other
factors, but some remailers do seem to be generally faster than others.
I didn't test elee7h5 at rosebud.ee.uh.edu since it always batches its
messages and sends them out at midnite.  remail at extropia.wimsey.com only
accepts encrypted mail so I'll have to try that one seperately sometime.
Note: hal at alumni.cco.caltech.edu forwards to hfinney at shell.portal.com
Also, 00x at uclink.berkeley.edu forwards to hh at soda.berkeley.edu
This makes these addresses a little slower, but I guess it helps foil
traffic analysis a bit...
Are there only 12 cypherpunk remailers plus two forwarding addresses? There were over twenty at one time... Please let me know if I've missed
