@_subject: Entropy, Randomness, etc. 
This is a supplement to the fine answer to your question which has
already provided by Scott Collins.
Actually, it can't be done.  The consistent measure of entropy for
finite objects like a string or a (finite) series of random numbers is
the so-called ``program length complexity''.  This is defined as the
length of the shortest program for some given universal Turing machine
which computes the string.  It's consistent in the sense that it has the
familiar properties of ``ordinary'' (Shannon) entropy.  Unfortunately,
it's uncomputable: there's no algorithm which, given an arbitrary finite
string S, computes the program-length complexity of S.
Program-length complexity is well-studied in the literature.  A good
introductory paper is ``A Theory of Program Size Formally Identical to
Information Theory'' by  G. J. Chaitin, _Journal of the ACM_, 22 (1975)
reprinted in Chaitin's book _Information Randomness & Incompleteness_,

Not even the antenna should be visible.  Remember, for spread spectrum radio

from the ambient noise.  One way to arrange this is to put the antenna inside of
a physically secure perimeter, outside of which the power density is too low for
noncoherent detection.  The perimeter can be optically opaque (e.g. a building),
as long as it leaks enough r.f. in the direction of the receiver(s) for coherent
detection.  Preventing noncoherent detection may often require _attenuation_ of
an otherwise too-powerful signal, and the building may serve part of this

Strong cryptography renders moot the Statist's arrogant pretense that

Why would a person want to do this?  Read on.
You made a fitting assertion which I believe to be true and worth

Government, deceit and all, is sustained and nourished by willful
participation, as you have previously pointed out in the passage
immediately following.  If you participate, it's your conscience you
have to live with.
Keep in mind that the United states is a membership association, not a
geographical region, so to ``live in the United States'' means to
willfully be a member of the United States.  So, yes, to ``live in the
United States'' is certainly to be a willful participant.
But if you're saying it's difficult for a non-member to avoid
participation, I agree; it's difficult.
Where participation is unavoidable, it's not willful.
Except nobody's arguing about willful partaking of societal benefit.
The issue is willful participation in _government_.
The benefit of society results from voluntary association among people.
Imposed relations, as institutionalized in government, benefit only
their perpetrators.

I had a similar question while trying to decide what version of PGP I'll
be switching to, and had the following dialogue with Paul E. Uhlhorn,
Director of Marketing, ViaCrypt, on the subject.
The lack of source code for ViaCrypt PGP is an issue.  If ViaCrypt PGP
2.7 were legitimately acquired, but the buyer, wary of black-box
(sourceless) software, instead used a variant of PGP 2.6ui patched to
identify itself as 2.7, would the substitution be detectable by any
observer?  Would either you or RSADSI object to this?
If a person were to make 2.6ui look like 2.7, ViaCrypt would
strongly object and would most likely pursue legal remedies.  Our
concerns would include copyright and patent (both IDEA and RSA)
infringement.  I cannot speak for PKP, Public Key Partners, but I
would expect PKP would also consider this patent infringement. I
understand 2.6ui to be a "patched" version of 2.3a which was not
licensed by RSA or PKP.
Once again, I believe it would be best to get a legal opinion on
this entire subject.  Please let me know if you find out other
information on this subject.
Is this true even if the person is a registered buyer of 2.7?
Public availability of a program's source code is a powerful means to be
sure that it is correct.  How can one gain such assurance for PGP 2.7?
How could confidence in the correctness of a secret program, even by its
author, ever match that of a program open to public scrutiny by any
interested person?
ViaCrypt has exactly the same position if a person were to
make 2.6ui look like ViaCrypt PGP V2.7 regardless of whether or
not they are a registered user of ViaCrypt PGP V2.7.  It is plain
dishonest and illegal!

Granted, the issue here is different from yours, but it does give an
idea of how ViaCrypt might react to an attempt to use their license to
legitimize your use of another PGP.  Hope this helps.

It's interesting that you put it exactly like that.  It happens that I
have been grappling, so far unsuccessfully, with the fact that there is
a group of people who _are_ ``left out in the cold''.  I would value
your comments on this.
A person in the group to which I refer is ``in the US'' by the commonly
understood geographical definition of that phrase, but has as a matter
of conscience renounced any citizenship he may have had.  He refuses on
principle to affirm that he is a national person, and therefore cannot
use PGP 2.6 because such affirmation is supposed to be required in order
to obtain PGP 2.6, and may therefore be implicit in each use of PGP 2.6.
On the other hand, if he uses PGP 2.6ui, he risks being accused of
violating RSADSI's patent rights, because they will take him to be ``in
the US'', even though he has disaffiliated himself.
What version of PGP can such a person use?

Fermat Number Transforms with Applications to Digitial Filtering'', IEEE
Trans on Accoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, Vol ASSP-22, No 2,
1974 April, ``...transform is proposed that is defined on a finite ring

Truth and honesty.
For it to de facto preempt honest alternatives.  I'm afraid that the NII
will be funded in part by taxation.  An honest person cannot in good
conscience willfully accept services funded by taxation when he has a
reasonable alternative.  The NII threatens the viability of honest
alternatives.  The reason is that even an honest person will find it
hard to justify paying more for access to a user-funded network when a
cheaper alternative such as NII is available because it is sustained by
expropriating the fruit of the toil of unconsenting others.
Some of us would prefer that relations among people be by mutual consent
or not at all.  Government programs, by contrast, imply imposition by
the politically victorious upon all others.
One can _not_ of course not worry about the cost.  The people who
install and maintain the system have to eat, too.  The pertinent
question is whether that money is given freely in exchange for service
rendered, or is expropriated from another without his consent through
taxation.  An honest user of the system suffers ongoing distress to know
that he benefits only because of another's oppression.
The NII should not come to be.  The ``N'' in NII stands for
``National''.  Nations are abominations, functioning as they do to
supplant personal choice with collective dictate.

point of strong cryptography if it leaves intact institutions able to
enforce a demand for passports?  Are they not as much an invasion of

In a word, no.  Here's why:
I am too.  It's going too slowly.  I wouldn't be here if the present
trend toward usage based pricing didn't exist.  To the extent that the
Internet is still funded through taxation (expropriating the fruits of
another's toil without his consent), I feel that I am receiving stolen
property by using the Internet.  Civility and decency demand that this
situation be ended as soon as possible.
Any more doubtful than that a newspaper or a magazine would survive?
Conceivable, perhaps.  A much more likely model would appear to be that
the requester would have to pay the bill, just as when buying a book or
a journal.
I certainly share with you this concern.  This underscores the
importance of anonymous digital cash and other technologies which enable
untraceable trading on the Internet.
There's also the pragmatic consideration that he who pays the piper gets
to call the tune.  If you don't want your neighbor interfering with your
Internet use of cryptography, for example, then don't make him pay the
bill for that use by acting to perpetuating your use of his tax money.

I have been asked in email what would happen if a person outside the
U.S. were to use it.
If a person were initially not a subject (``outside'') of the U.S., he
would destroy that status in the process of acquiring PGP 2.5.  This
follows from the MIT announcement:
For non-commercial use, one has a choice between PGP 2.3a and PGP 2.5.
For a ``United States of America'' user, the legality of 2.3a is
questioned on patent grounds, but 2.5 is available.  For a free
(non-national) person, on the other hand, 2.5 is unavailable according
to the MIT announcement above, but there is no problem with 2.3a.  The
situation seems contrived to force each non-commercial PGP user to
declare whether he is free or a ``United States of America'' user.
Confusion may arise by interpreting ``user in the United States of
America'' as a statement about geography rather than one about
allegiance.  This would be a mistake.  The founding documents of the
United States of America imply that their government is only of those
who consent, so it is clearly a matter of allegiance, not geography.
Acceptance of PGP 2.5 is one way to signal such consent, since 2.3a is

You enjoy a measure of protection because a United States of America
person doesn't have the knee-jerk tendency to presume jurisdiction over
a person at your geographic remove that he has for person located in
North America.  A person located in North America is more at risk of
losing her freeman status by switching to 2.5 (or now 2.6), and must be
careful not to give her neighbor, who may be a United States of America
person, an excuse to invoke his government's tyranny.
It's hard for me to believe that conditions are that different for you,
or do you surrender without qualification to jurisdiction of NZ law?

What they certainly _do_ recognize, however, is that a person who _does_
agree to the PGP 2.5 terms has affirmed that he _is_ a national person.
This could be used by a court to negate any subsequent denial by the
person that he is a subject of the United States of America or Canada.
The absence on one's record of such affirmations is a prerequisite for
freeman status.

...a reputation you have earned well in your postings to this list,

How could you do this, without incurring cognitive dissonance?
Government differs from the oncoming truck in that its power comes from
its constituency of willing clients generating a demand for its
services.  Granted, withdrawing your demand will hardly affect that
power, because the other hundred million constituents will still be
pressing their demands.
But how do you deflect accusations of inconsistency and hypocrisy?  Our
archist adversaries use such charges to deflate anarchist arguments.
I don't understand and am increasingly unable to abide the inconsistent
and hypocritical attitude of many of my anarchist friends who decry
government while at the same time willfully patronizing it, even when
they have reasonable alternatives.  You have apparently accommodated
yourself to this inconsistency.  How?

Eric Hughes, in the cypherpunks welcome message:
Egregious among the ``large, faceless organizations'' is the tyranny
erected by the majority, ``at least half the people'', called democratic
political government.
My interpretation of the welcome message has always been that a
cypherpunk works to create his own privacy _in spite of_ interference by
``at least half the people'', acknowledging that these people are not to
be expected to grant that privacy on their own.
I do not concede that half the people being against privacy means that
I've lost.  I seek to apply what I learn through cypherpunks to create
my privacy even without their approval.

That she sees crypto as a way to defend against him (e.g. by buying

Unfortunately, lots of people gratuitously accept those benefits or even

Fading of government power must begin with popular refusal to
gratuitously accept the favors of government.  Since this looks
unlikely, it appears to me that the trend to ever-more oppressive
government will continue for a while yet.  It will probably only end in
catastrophic collapse.
Big government is caused not by ``rulers'', but by the demand created by
its beneficiaries.  Kill the rulers, and the beneficiaries will erect
new ones in their place.  Kill the beneficiaries and the rulers will
find themselves without a job.
More useful than the rulers-ruled division is the division into those
who gratuitously accept the benefits of government (usually without even
realizing that this is why government gets so big), and those who
scrupulously avoid gratuitous involvement with government.  The latter
are an infinitesimal fraction who are being overwhelmed by the former.

Carl Ellison  writes
Don't attribute to a sinister, power-hungry elite that which is a
natural consequence of democratic political society.  Execution of the
voters' orders can be thwarted by strong crypto.  This is affirmed by
voices as diverse as Donn Parker, who says that a democracy can't
operate if people have absolute privacy, and Tim May, who seeks to use
crypto as a way to bypass democracy.  As long as a large proportion of
the people think it's somehow decent or civilized to democratically
supplant personal choice with collective dictate in everything from
health care arrangements to the elementary school curriculum, there will
be a large constituency for limiting crypto to prevent this interference
with their tyranny of the majority.
The danger of focusing on the intrigues of the power elite is that it
diverts attention from the real culprit: democracy itself.
