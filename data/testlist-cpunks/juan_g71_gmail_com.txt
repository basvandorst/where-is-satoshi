"The essential character of a free society is this: That which is
not forbidden is permitted." That's a useless tautology. The essential character of a free society is
unconditional respect for life liberty and property of people, worldwide,
PLUS a libertarian culture. "The essential character of an unfree
society is the inverse, that which is not permitted is forbidden."
That's the inverse of the previous, virtually meaningless tautology. "The U.S. began as a free society without question;" That's a glaringly false statement. The US began as a **slave society** and remained a **slave society** until
a crazy **civil war** ended slavery well into the 19th century, though
that was **not** the main goal of the civil war anyway.
Today the US is the biggest fascist country on the planet (fascism =
militarism, nationalism, collusion of big business and government).
I'm wondering if Dan's technical views on so called cybersecurity are as
idiosyncratic as his political theory?

" What makes Tor different from the usual thesaurus-full of government
projects is that Tor is essentially a very elaborate math trick, using
layers of math puzzles to create a network-within-the-network. That
math is being implemented in front of a global audience of millions of
sophisticated watchers. It is likely the most examined codebase in the
world. It has been subjected to multiple public audits. The math, well
known and widely standardized, will work for everyone, or it will not,
whoever pays the bills." What a piece of dishonest garbage. Now it turns out that all
software is 'math' so it either 'works'  or not? All the usual
problems with government funded activities magically go away because
"it's math". Wow. The stupid is overwhelming. "millions of sophisticated watchers" LOL - I wonder how many people actually reviewed tor's source? 10? 50?
Or maybe 0?
The funny thing with these zealots is that they are way more brazen and
full of shit than even the tor developers.

Tor is a project of the US government, the most righteous and clever
organization on the planet, and the invincible defenders of free speech.
Their anonymity network is simply unassailable. $3000? Please.
Look, their own site says "Protect your privacy. Defend yourself against network surveillance and
traffic analysis."[1]
See? Using tor you can defend yourself against TRAFFIC ANALYSIS! There
you have it. How on earth can tor be vulnerable to trivial traffic
analysis when their site says just the opposite? HA! I bet you are so crazy as to think that the tor guys are stupid

You know, apart from the theoretical/logical (and moral) case for
anarchism, I also have a less principled remark to make. Actually it's a rather pragmatic, 'realistic' and utilitarian remark : I wouldn't object too much to reformism/gradualism IF it really worked.
But if anything, and as matter of cold hard fact, reformism seems to
work against freedom.

The tor 'anonimity'  network is a project of the US military. As such,
it must serve the ends of the US military. If the alleged ends of the tor project do not match the ends of the US
military, the alleged tor ends are just a cover lie, or a lame
half-truth at best.
The real ends of the US military, are, of course, not 'officially'
acknowledged though they are widely known, even among half-educated
The US military is the biggest criminal organization on the planet and its real purpose is to further the global interests of the US
government and US fascist business. To do this  they routinely invade
countries and murder millions of people.
Bear in mind the moral outlook of these people when analyzing their
Would the US military create an anonimity network that they can't
subvert? Of course not. The tor network can prevent ordinary users A and B from learning their
respective locations, but if a third party C (say, US government) can
monitor A's and B's traffic, it can 'deanonimize'  them.
As a side note, tor can be and is routinely blocked, rendering it
rather useless. In cases where tor could make people anonymous, at
least from the point of view of servers like, say, IRC servers , access
is blocked by the servers operators. So much for 'free speech'.
Suming up, the first objective of the tor network is to give a 'gratis'
and subverted 'tool' to...targets of government surveillance. Pure
Another  objective of the tor network is to get around the blocking
system of, say, the chinese network. Since china is firewalled, the US
military can't easily spy on chinese people.
So, what the tor employees (accomplices of the fascist US governemnt)
do is 1) pretend that they 'fight'  for ' free speech' in china
2) gather information about people in china who, by using tor, signal
that they are potentially 'interesting' to the US military.  Again, the 'official' motives and the real motives do not match,

"Google has a fairly broad commitment to freedom of expression. There
are actually people whose entire job here is to advocate for and work
on freedom of expression. I know because I had a lot of meetings with

2) uses symmetric encryption (users already shared the key)
3) application uses a server for people to learn each other's addresses,
but after the address exchange, the messages are sent p2p (maybe something based off IRC?)

- Some of us believe various forms of strong cryptography
     will cause the power of the state to decline, perhaps even
     collapse fairly abruptly. We believe the expansion into
     cyberspace, with secure communications, digital money,
     anonymity and pseudonymity, and other crypto-mediated
     interactions, will profoundly change the nature of
     economies and social interactions." TM

Cartman: 	I learned somethin' today. This country was founded by
some of the smartest thinkers the world has ever seen. And they knew
one thing: that a truly great country can go to war, and at the same
time, act like it doesn't want to. You people who are for the war, you
need the protesters. Because they make the country look like it's made
of sane, caring individuals. And you people who are anti-war, you need
these flag-wavers, because, if our whole country was made up of nothing
but soft pussy protesters, we'd get taken down in a second. That's why
the founding fathers decided we should have both. It's called "having
your cake and eating it too." Randy: 	He's right. The strength of this country is the ability
to do one thing and say another.

Hancock: 	Mr. Franklin, where do you stand on the war issue?
Franklin: 	I believe that if we are to form a new country, we
cannot be a country that appears war-hungry and violent to the rest of
the world. However, we also cannot be a country that appears weak and
unwilling to fight to the rest of the world. So, what if we form a
country that appears to want both? Jefferson: 	Yes. Yes of course. We go to war, and protest going
to war at the same time.
Dickinson: 	Right. If the people of our new country are allowed
to do whatever they wish, then some will support the war and some will
protest it. Franklin: 	And that means that as a nation, we could
go to war with whomever we wished, but at the same time, act like we
didn't want to. If we allow the people to protest what the government
does, then the country will be forever blameless. [holding a slice of chocolate cake] It's like having your cake, and
eating it, too. Congressman 2: 	Think of it: an entire nation
founded on saying one thing and doing another. Hancock: 	And we
will call that country the United States of America.

Seems to me that it's rather easy for terrorists to create simple
hardware for at least secure text messaging (or more). The recipe goes something like this :
1) a microcontroller.
2) a keyboard 3) an 'old' lcd text display
4) eeprom memory - sd card
5) a bunch of discrete components for a noise generator.
The idea is to mix all those ingredients plus code to get a system that
can 1) generate random data to be used as key in 'one time pad' encryption
2) input text messages (and encrypt them of course)
3) decrypt text messages to the screen
(if the microcontroller can act as an usb host it maybe possible to get
data from devices like cameras and encrypt it)
The thing is, distribution of the key material should be trivial for
any 'terrist' worth his salt.  So the only drawback of the allegedly
secure one time pad isn't really an issue. I'm guessing that any real 'spies' out there have been using something
like this for a while.

million muslims. I assume the figures are inflated but even if the
real numbers are lower, we're still seriously fucked up =/
A while back I read that 75% of americans consider the bible to be the
'word of god'  or 'inspired by god'.  (oh, here's the source
 )
Do you Shelley (or others) think that estimate is accurate?

Hehehe. Nice animation although I don't think the "All creative work is
derivative" line is completely true. As a matter of fact, she shows a
lot of stuff that is in a way 'original'. Except for the jesus part
haha. (just in case, I'm no way defending any kind of intellectual property)
Seems to me that the "all work depends on previous work" take is
better suited to science and technology?

We have a solution in the works which will require big changes into our
software stack which we believe will mitigate such problems, but
unfortunately it will take time to implement. Additionally, we have
recently been discovering suspicious activity around our servers which
led us to believe that some of the attacks described in the research
could be going on and we decided to move servers once again, however
this is only a temporary solution.
At this point, while we don't have a solution ready it would be unsafe
to keep our users using the service, since they would be in jeopardy.
Thus, and to our great sadness we have to take the market offline for a
while, until we can develop a better solution. This is the best course
of action for everyone involved.
In the mean time we shall do our best to clear all outstanding orders
and we ask all of you users who have money on their accounts, withdraw
them as soon as possible, because we don't want to be responsible for
it during the time when the market will be offline.
During this time, there might be some delays in payouts, since many
people are expected to withdraw money at the same time, but we intend
to resolve any such issues in the end. But we advice you to use only
destination bitcoin addresses that do not expire when you send money
out from Agora, as the payments to them might get delayed.
While the market is offline, do not send any bitcoin to any of your
deposit addresses on Agora. We do not gurantee the safety of any funds
sent there.
Vendors, we strongly advice you to abort any orders that haven't been
sent out or processed yet, as we cannot gurantee what will happen with
the orders in resolution. We shall try to resolve it on a case-by-case
basis, but there might not be time to wait for orders that require long
shipping times.
We are going to handle the situation with the vendor bonds soon, we
need some time to make sure that noone uses this as an opportunity to
start scamming wildly.
All of the market data will be kept intact and be available upon
return, including all of the user history and profile data.
Since our PGP key is nearing expiration date, here is a new PGP key
which could be used to check authenticity of our messages in the future.

A couple of people have sent me pinging messages, asking about my
status on the Cypherpunks list....apparently it has taken several weeks
for folks to notice my absence! :-}  This may speak volumes about why I
have left the list, and what the list has become.....
I chose not to write a "departing flame" (or message, but some might
call it a flame) when I unsubscribed several weeks ago--within an hour
of reading that John and Sandy had decided to make "their" list a
moderated list, by the way--as I saw little benefit. I was also fed up
with things, and saw no point in wasting even more of my time arguing
against the New Cypherpunks World Order, as the NCWO was clearly
presented as a fait accompli, not something ablut which opinions of
list members (or even list _founders_, at least not me) were being
sought. It's my nature to just say "Fuck it" and leave when I feel I
have overstayed my time, or things are no longer fun, or I am made to
feel unwelcome.
But since several people have pinged me, asking about my status, I'll
take some time to say a few things. I've had access to the hks.net
archive site, and/or the Singapore site, to occasionally see what was
being said on the list (old habits die slowly, so I sometimes drop in
to see what you people are flaming each other about...not
surprisingly--in fact utterly predictably--I see vast amounts of
bandwidth consumed by arguments about moderation, about the putative
biases of the Moderator and Director of the New Cypherpunks World
Order, about alternative moderation strategies (which is stupid, as
John and Sandy announced what they were going to do, not just some of
their preliminary thoughts), and so on. I've also noticed fewer
substantive essays. With no false modesty I tried awfully hard to
compose substantive essays on crypto-political topics, often more than
one per day. (Others did too, but they seem to be tapering off as well,
leaving the list to be dominated by something called a "Toto," the
"O.J. was framed!" ravings of Dale Thorn, the love letters between
Vulis and someone name Nurdane Oksas, and the occasional bit of crypto
news. Ho hum. I'm glad I'm not reading the list in e-mail, and thus can
easily avoid replying to these inanities...which would probably not be
approved for reading by Sandy, so why bother anyway?)
Rather than compose a traditional essay, I'll take the  easy way out and
list some bulleted points.
* First, I don't argue that John Gilmore is unfree to do as he wishes
  with his machine, toad, which has been the major machine host for the
Cypherpunks list. John can tell us we have to write in Pig Latin if he
wishes. Much of the debate I saw in the archives was debate that missed
  the point about what John could and couldn't do. No one can seriously
  question the right of the owner of a machine, or the owner of a
  restaurant, etc., to set the policies he wishes. The owner of a
  restaurant is perfectly free--or used to be, and still is to anyone
  with even slightly libertarian or freedom tendencies--to set the
  rules of his "house." He may insist that shirts and shoes be worn, or
  that smoking is not allowed (or even is required, in theory), etc. He
  may say "All those eating in my restaurant must wear funny hats and
  have their costumes approved by Sandy Sandfort." This is
  unexceptionable.
* However, anyone who disputes these rules (disputes in the sense of
disliking or disagreeing with them, not legally challenging them) is
  free to leave. Those who don't like crowded, noisy, smoke-filled
  sports bars are encourgaged to leave. And so on. Again,
  unexceptionable.
(The more complicated case of contracts, verbal or written, and
"changing the rules," does not apply here. No one had a contract with
John, or Sandy, or Hugh, etc., so this is not germane.)
* But the really important issue is this: is the _physical hosting_ of
  the Cypherpunks mailing list coterminous with the "Cypherpunks"? If
  the list was hosted by, say, UC Berkeley or PGP Incorporated, would
  we consider these hosts to be the "owners" of the Cypherpunks group?
  Would we think that a corporate host, say, would have the authority
  to direct what we could say on the list? (Again, not disputing their
  corporate property rights...as a libertarian, I cannot. Other issues
  are what I'm getting at.)
* If a Boy Scout troop meets at a local church, and has for several
  years, continuously, would we consider the church to be the owner of
  the troop? Could the church insist on avoidance of certain "cuss
  words" and demand that prayers be said before each gathering?
  Certainly the church could tell the troop what policies were to be
  followed if the the facilities were to be used, etc., and the troop
  could leave if it didn't like the terms (or, in parallel with my
  situation, any troop member could choose to leave....). This is what
  we mean by "property rights": the legal right of a property owner to
  do with his property as he wishes, modulo prior contractual
  relationships, criminal laws, etc.
* How did the mailing list for the group, now called Cypherpunks, get
started, and how did it end up being run off of John's hardare? Hugh
  Daniel got the actual mailing list rolling, based on a discussion
  Eric Hughes, Hugh, and I had the day after the first physical
  meeting, in September 1992. We thought the group we had just spent
  the day with ought to be able to stay in touch, and that a mailing
  list was the right way to go. There was talk of siting it on the UC
  Berkeley computers (actually, the Undergraduate Association
  computers, a la the Cypherpunks archive site at "csua"), but Hugh
  thought he might be able to use "toad," and this is what happened. (I
  have not heard from Hugh on his views of this New and Moderated
  Non-Anarchic List.)
* I think we should all be very grateful to John for agreeing to let it
  run on his hardware, but not let our gratitude turn into some sort of
subservience and blather about how John "owns" the Cypherpunks group.
* Again, is the "Cyherpunks community" the same as the mailing list?
  And is the mailing list, hosted at toad, the "property" of John
  Gilmore?
* In my view, neither John nor Sandy in any sense "own" our group. It
  is a virtual community which sometimes has physical meetings at
  various places (including corporations, restaurants, and bookstores,
  none of which are even partial "owners" of the group) and which has
  had several instantiations on the Net, including sub-lists not
  connected to toad.com in any way. While John is of course free at any
  time to suspend his hosting of the list, I think it a serious
  misapprehension of the basic nature of virtual communities to accept
  the claim that John should decide on what is appropriate to bear the
  "Cypherpunks" list imprimatur and what is to be consigned to the
  flame list.
* The mechanics of the announcement troubled me greatly. To be blunt, I
  was seething with anger. I was mightily annoyed to read that John had
  made a decision to appoint Sandy as his Moderator, with no discussion
  on the list. I don't know if Eric Hughes and Hugh Daniel were asked
  their opinions, but I certainly know I was not. I feel that as one of
  the two or three founders, depending on how one is counting, and as a
  frequent contributor to the list since its inception, and so on, I
  (and others) should at least have been told of this plan. Better yet,
  have the plans discussed on the list, as some good ideas may have
  been generated.
I'll have more to say about my problems with how things were handled.
Frankly, it smacked of the same kind of fait accompli decision John made
with the unsubscribing of Vulis. While John had (and has) every legal
right to do with his property as he wished, the effect was very
negative. First, Vulis found other ways to post (duh). Second, the list
was consumed with flames about this, many from Vulis, and many from
others. Third, journalists (who love sizzle over substance any day of
the week) lept into the fray with articles which gave Vulis the
publicity he craved. Fourth, it sent a message to enemies of liberty
that "Even the Cypherpunks have found it necessary to abandon their
anarchic ways."
(I'm well aware of the issues with pests like Vulis, who seek to destroy
virtual communities like ours. But the solution John used did not work,
and generated more crap. As you all should know, it was John himself
who coined the wonderful saying, "The Net interprets censorship as
damage and routes around it." A delicious irony.)
* In the archives, I did see a bunch of "I support Sandy" and "John is
  our leader" comments from reasonable people. The obvious noise of
  Vulis and his cohorts like Aga made a "Do something!" attitude
  somewhat understandable. I don't think the decision made was a wise
  one, and I strongly doubt it will work to make the list a better one.
* The proper solution to bad speech is more speech, not censorship.
Censorship just makes opponents of "speech anarchy" happy--it affirms
  their basic belief that censors are needed.
* "Censorship" is another overloaded term. I don't think the
  "Definition 1" of dictionary definitions, about _governmental_
  restrictions, is the only meaningful definition. Everybody knows what
  it meant when we say that "Lockheed is censoring the views of
  employees," even though we know Lockheed is not using government
  power. A censor is one who censors. And even my "American Heritage
  Dictionary" gives this as its "definition 1":
"censor n. 1. A person authorized to examine books, films, or other
material and to remove or suppress morally, politically, or otherwise
(Other dictionaries of course give similar definitions. The notion that
censors are confined to being government employees is a misconception.)
* OK, even given that John had decided to censor "his" list, what about
  his choice of Sandy Sandfort as the censor? I've known Sandy for
  several years (I was the one who invited him to the second
  Cypherpunks meeting), but he's a poor choice as a censor, moderator,
  whatever. First, because he has so often gotten involved in
  protracted flame wars, such as with Vulis (remember the dozens of
  messages about the "bet" to bring Vulis out? I stayed out of the
  charade completely.), with Hallam-Baker, and with others. Second,
  because he has not been actively composing essays for a while,
  perhaps because of his job with Community Connexion. Other reasons,
  too.
(I count Sandy as a friend, but I'm just being honest here. Sandy is
just not a "Peter Neumann" (moderator of the "RISKS" list).
* Nor do the announced criteria make any sense. While the inane one-line
scatological insults have been filtered out, many "flames" make it
  through, based on what I've seen in perusing the hks archive site.
  And some reasonable comments get dumped in the flame bucket.
* As expected, those who only want to talk about cryptography (but who
rarely do, themselves, also as expected) waste bandwidth saying the
"anarchist" and "libertarian" stuff ought to go in to the "rejected"
  list. More bandwidth wasted, as each group lobbies to have its
  ideological opponents censored by Sandy.
* I would have had no problem had John announced that he was creating a
  new list, the "Good Stuff" list, with Sandy has his Chooser of Good
  Stuff. After all, both Eric Blossom and Ray Arachelian already offer
  just such lists, and more would not hurt.
But by making the _main list_ the censored one, this skewed things
* (Frankly, one of my considerations in leaving was the feeling that I
would never know if an essay I'd spent hours composing would be
  rejected by Sandy for whatever reasons....maybe he might think my
  essay was off-topic, or used one of the Seven Deadly Words, or was
  "too flamish." Whatever. I realized that life is too short to have
  Sandy Sandfort deciding whether my essays should go out to the main
  list (which is really just a list like Eric Blossom's best-of list,
  except it is be edict now the main list) or be dumped into the flames
  list, to be read by a handful of people.)
* Why, many reasonable people may ask, did I not simply unsubscribe from
the "Cypherpunks" list and subscribe to the "Cypherpunks-Unedited) (or
whatever it is called) list? Because of my overall anger with the issues
raised above. The imperiousness of the decision, the notion of favoring
Sandy's tastes in a more "first class" way than, say, the tastes of Eric
Blossom, Ray Arachelian, or, for that matter, me.  "Some censors are
  more equal than others."
* The decision to "moderate" (censor) the Cypherpunks list is powerful
ammunition to give to our opponents, and Vulis is certainly gleeful that
his fondest wishes have been realized. And it won't work. People are
consuming even more bandwidth arguing the merits of John's decision, the
traffic is presumably being slowed down by the need for Sandy to wade
through the traffic and stamp "Approved" or "Rejected" on what he
  glances at, and people are "testing the limits" of what they can say
  and what they can't say.
* It also sends a message that people are incapable of filtering out bad
speech, that they need a censor to do it for them. (Again, I have no
problem with competing "screeners," a la having Ray, Eric, or David
Sternlight filtering what they think is OK and what is not. Let a
  thousand filtering services bloom.) But the clear message by having
  Sandy censor the main list (the default list, the list name with the
  main name, the list we all know about, etc.) is that Cypherpunks need
  Big Brother to shelter them from Bad Thoughts, from Naughty Words,
  from Evil Flames, and from Impure Desires. Foo on that.
* Psychologists might point to random reinforcement, even to the
  effects of terror. How many of us are likely to write controversial
  posts knowing that Sandy might wake up having a "bad hair day" and
  thus reject our posts? How many will begin to skew their opinions to
  match those of Sandy? (I would venture a guess that a Duncan Frissell
  would almost certainly get a libertarian rant past Sandy while a
  Phill Hallam-Baker might easily fail to get a leftist rant past him.)
* Those who want "less noise" should subcontract with the filter
  services of their own choosing. This is the "Cypherpunk Way." Having
  Sandy as the censor is the easy way out.
* By the way, the moderated list "RISKS"  works pretty well. But it is
  not a _discussion_ group. It is, rather, a digest of news items
  related to computer and technology risks, with some discussion by
  various contributors, and with a long turnaround time of a few issues
  per week, tops. Peter Neumann also devotes a lot of time to making it
  run smoothly and bases part of his professional career on running it.
  I surmise that Sandy is not prepared to do the same. Nor would this
  be a good idea, as this would kill the spirit of the debate.
* Had there been a debate about the policy, I can think of several
approaches I'd like better. But inasmuch as John made it clear that
  there would be no debate (and, perhaps as part of the "problem," John
  has not really been a active member of the mailing list, in terms of
  participating in the debates), this is all moot.
In any case, my several years with the list have taken a huge amount of
my time. Given the way this whole thing was handled, and the way the
list is degenerating even further, it looks like it's good that I'm
moving on to other things.
* To summarize:
- the decision to censor the list was made without any discussion on the
list, without any discussion with at least some of the longterm core
contributors, and was presented as a "fait accompli."
- while John has every right to do with his hardware as he wishes, he
  does not "own" the Cypherpunks group (though whether he owns the
  "list" is a semantically debatable point)
- whatever our group once was, or still is, is not dependent on having a
particular mailing list running on someone's home machine...and it
  cannot be claimed that any person "owns" the Cypherpunks group.
- there is some talk of creating another Cypherpunks list, on other
machines; I don't know whether or not this will fly, or if I'll devote
  any time to such lists.
- the effect of censorship, such as I have seen it so far, is not
  producing a better list. In fact, as I would have expected, it is
  producing a more boring and sheltered list.
And so there you have it.
I had no plans to set down my views, feeling it was a waste of my time
and your time. Rather than foam and rant the way some did (and Vulis
must have posted 100 messages on the subject), I chose to simply make
my exit, quickly.
But as I have recently seen several mentions of my absence (including a
particularly complimentary comment from Asgaard--thanks), I do feel I
owe it to you all to explain my views.
Which I have done. Have a nice year, and a nice millenium in a couple
of years.

Adams: 	We must go to war!
Dickinson: 	But what about the violence?! The lives lost?! If we
found a country, it should be founded on peace and diplomacy.
Congressman 1: 	England will only understand one thing: Force.
Congressman 2: 	[rises] I must state again for the record that
South Carolina, North Carolina,
 Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Georgia are against war! [pounds the table
 with his fist] Congressman 3: 	Yeah, because you don't care
 about the fate of the Colonies like we do! You're all unpatriotic! And
 if you don't like the Colonies, then you can git out!  	Don't you call us unpatriotic! We're protesting this war
 because we care so deeply for the fate of our Colonies! You are all
 unpatriotic for leading the Colonies into a war that half of them
 don't want! [the various Congressmen begin squabblig with each other]
Cartman: 	[observing] Whoa, how very very relevant. Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble
Rabble Rabble! Dickinson: 	We cannot found a country based on
war! Adams: 	We cannot found a country that is afraid to fight!
Congressman: 	Rabble!
Congressmen: 	Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble!
[the doors open and in walks an august figure. The boisterous voices
become hushed] Oh my, it's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin.
It's Benjamin Franklin. [they keep murmuring this as Franklin walks
towards the main desk] Cartman: 	Oh, it's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin.
It's Benjamin Franklin. Hancock: 	Mr. Franklin, where do you stand on the war issue? Franklin: 	I believe that if we are to form a new country, we
cannot be a country that appears war-hungry and violent to the rest of
the world. However, we also cannot be a country that appears weak and
unwilling to fight to the rest of the world. So, what if we form a
country that appears to want both? Jefferson: 	Yes. Yes of course. We go to war, and
protest going to war at the same time. Dickinson: 	Right. If the people of our new country are allowed
to do whatever they wish, then some will support the war and some will
protest it. Franklin:      And that means that as a nation, we could go to war
with whomever we wished, but at the same time, act like we didn't want
to. If we allow the people to protest what the government does, then the
country will be forever blameless. Adams: 	[holding a slice of chocolate
cake] It's like having your cake, and eating it, too. Congressman 2:	Think of it: an entire nation founded on saying
one thing and doing another. Hancock: 	And we will call that country the
United States of America. Think of it: an entire nation founded on saying one thing and
doing another.

"Appelbaum's departure under seemingly normal circumstances being
seized as excuse to (what appears to be) institutionally slander him."
"The smear site is privacy-protected as to ownership but
it appears to use github's servers.
 Hasn't github been
'compromised'? "
** hacking conspiracy against github too!
" You mean like my "Mistake" assuming ioerror was the victim of
orchestrated institutional slander?" "The reason I noted it so quickly is because Institutional
Slander campaigns aren't new, "

"Security Effectiveness of the Israeli West Bank Barrier" "The Barrier together with associated security activities was effective
in preventing suicide bombings and other attacks and fatalities with
little if any apparent displacement. Changes in terrorist behavior
likely resulted from the construction of the Barrier, not from other
external factors or events." So that's the kind of nazi war propaganda that this highly reputable
new member of the tor's 'board of directors' posts in his blog.
Also look at this comment from one of his supremacist bots :
"Shachar • July 15, 2016 2:07 AM
I always wondered about such comments. What makes Miko Peled's version
of how things went down more reliable than other sources?..." That guy shachar is replying to sombebody who used the nickname "free".
So now look for the post that schachar is replying to? OOPS. It doesn't
exist. And that's because it was deleted by  schneier =) And I know because I made the censored post : Here's the post deleted by
tor's director and neocunt schneier
The truth about the jew land thieves (and worse) Only three lines, but three lines too much for worthless scumbags like
schneier =)
Here's a cached version of the page, just in case...

the worthless EFF cunt who now rules the 'tor project' corporation
vomited : "two additional people...are no longer involved with the Tor Project."
So who are those people who won't be getting any more pentagon money? It's funny how the universal champions of 'transparency' can fire
people without even naming them? I wouldn't like to imagine that they
have 'secret' 'nameless' employees? The tor corporation should stop writing software and devote all their
limitless talents to write a universal manual on universal
transparency.

ps:  you don't seem to know the A of the ABC of american society.
American society is *the* poster child for corporatism/fascism. The
cooperation between the 'privte' sector and the 'public' sector is
complete. Only a government agent would suggest that an american
university isn't fully in bed with the american government.

Users Get Routed:
Traffic Correlation on Tor by Realistic Adversaries
Our results show that Tor users are  FAR MORE SUSCEPTIBLE to compromise
than indicated by prior work. QUITE SIMPLE AND EFFICIENT TECHNIQUES CAN CORRELATE TRAFFIC
at these separate locations by taking advantage of identifying traf-
fic patterns [29]. As a result, the user and his destination may be
identified, completely subverting the protocolâs security goals.
Given the SEVERITY OF THE TRAFFIC CORRELATION PROBLEM and its se-
curity implications, we develop an analysis framework for evaluat-
ing the security of various user behaviors on the live
OUR ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT 80% OF ALL TYPES OF USERS MAY BE DE-
ANONYMIZED BY A RELATIVELY MODERATE TOR-RELAY ADVERSARY WITHIN SIX
OUR RESULTS ALSO SHOW THAT AGAINST A SINGLE AS ADVERSARY
ROUGHLY 100% OF USERS IN SOME COMMON LOCATIONS ARE DEANONYMIZED
WITHIN THREE MONTHS (95% IN THREE MONTHS FOR A SINGLE IXP)

Now, all the RETARDS who parrot that 'tor stinks' perhaps should try to
update their mental databases.

Steve Kinney 'asserted' :
"TOR is a two edged sword that can also be used
against the National Interest, so the NSA thinks TOR stinks." Steve Kinney is a charlatan who hasn't done basic research about tor and
simply parrots bullshit he got from the 'main stream media'
When informed about basic research showing tor's flaws Steve Kinney
blantantly ignores it, because he is an intellectual fraud. And then he writes baseless bullshit like the stuff below.

Also, there's a guy constantly repeating that his family in iran is
going to be murdered because of this CIA guy.  The story is completely
nonsense of course. Supposedly, the iranian guy is working for tor, *helping the pentagon
undermine the iranian government*. That's fine and dandy. The iranian
gov't doesn't really care. HOWEVER, if the silly story about the CIA
agent gets out, now the iranian government is going to kill this guy's
family....why exactly? Because now they really understood what tor is
about? Please.

completely breaking down the Chinese miner cartel. Which yes, means
bricking all their hardware. It's time to do this, not least of all
because having this precedent is extremely important for safeguarding
Bitcoin in the future. We must show that we ~are~ able to destroy a
miner cartel, or else."

Ha! "sedentism" translates to "sedentarismo" in spanish, so I assumed
"sedentarism" was an actual english word...bur apparentely it isn't.
Funny that Rayzer used it...
