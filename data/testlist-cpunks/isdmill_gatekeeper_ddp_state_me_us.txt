I think the second poster assumed what I did - that the message would be split into say 5 parts, each to be encrypted differently.  How to X-or split the message isn't obvious to me - pnrg? If you use some bytes conveniently hanging around you may as well use a OTP, since both ends need the same bitstream.  Unless I'm missing something, which is usually the case.
