I just wanted to note that hosting things in Canada isn't inherently, or
necessarily, safer than hosting in other countries. Canadian courts are
as able as American courts to apply pressure towards 'privacy sensitive'
companies, with Hushmail being a good example.
I would also note that Canada's lawful access legislation - perhaps on
ice now, but something that will likely come back to life at some point
- includes a decryption requirement that could have serious implications
for companies providing encryption services/encrypting data in transit.
A colleague of mine and I have written a piece on those decryption
requirements (which is available at
 as they
would affect cloud services, and it might be of interest to people on
this list.
