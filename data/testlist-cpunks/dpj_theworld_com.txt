I think Ed's criticism is off-target.  Where is the "privacy problem" with
Chaum receipts when Ed and others still have the freedom to refuse
theirs or throw them away?
It seems a legitimate priority for a voting system to be designed to
assure voters that the system is working.  What I see in serious
voting system research efforts are attempts to build systems that
provide both accountability and privacy, with minimal tradeoffs.
If some kind of tradeoff between accountability and privacy is inevitable,
in an extreme scenario, I'd still prefer the option to make the tradeoff for
myself, rather than have the system automatically choose for me.

These problems begin elsewhere.  Whether a receipt would add any
new problem depends on further analysis.
These are all relevant issues, and the system needs to be considered
as a whole.
The threat of coercion is present regardless of whether there's a
system-provided receipt, linkable, anonymous, or none. For example,
I might be told that after I vote I'll come face-to-face with a thug around
the corner, who will ask who I voted for, and who has a knack for
spotting liars. Or I may be told there's a secret camera in the booth.
Or I may think I'm at risk in simply showing up to vote, due to my public
party affiliation records, physical appearance, etc.
These issues must be addressed, and these concerns show that the
integrity of receipt validation must be ensured to at least the same
degree as the integrity of vote casting.  But *absolute* voter privacy
seems like an unobtainable goal, and it should not be used to trump
other important goals, like accountability.
