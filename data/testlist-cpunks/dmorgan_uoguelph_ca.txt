@_subject: Canadian Encryption info??? 
I have been following this list for several months, but have not seen
anything on encryption issues with regards to Canada specifically.
Does anyone know anything about [or have any idea where to begin to
look for] Canada's policies regarding encryption and encryption
technology??  Will Canadian laws change if/when Clipper encryption comes
into functional existence?  What about if the US enacts laws regarding
making other forms of encruyption illegal?  Is encryption mentionned in
NAFTA or any other negotiated treaty with the United States???

@_subject: IRC & HTTP proxy servers (fwd) 
This is a copy of my reply to Jonathan Cooper's request for legitimate uses of anonymous services...
---------- Forwarded message ----------
An example of use of anonymous servers:
There is a newsgroup called alt.sexual.abuse.recovery [among others], a
healing forum for survivors of sexual abuse/assault [often childhood
sexual abuse], their significant others, and other support people.  For
obvious reasons, for many there is a need for anonymity [many of those who
post would be killed VERY quickly if their true location/identity were
discovered]. There is also an irc channel,   which is used by
"asarians" for "live" discussions of many issues, ranging from very
serious survivor issues to having electronic snowball fights.  Again, for
many, anonymity is VERY important. So yes, there ARE some very legitimate uses for anonymous servers, whether irc or email or netnews posting...
If you want any further info, please ask.
