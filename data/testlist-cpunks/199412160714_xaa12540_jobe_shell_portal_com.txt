@_subject: Amanda and MIME 
Amanda wrote an interesting post.
I think if we only use MIME, the quality of discussion on the list
would skyrocket.  Eric, you should block all non-MIME posts to the
list.  How could we have been so blind?
I've come to rethink my position
on MIME.  It is definitely the
savior.  After all, this formatting
just has some extra stuff which
should be to hard to read
around.  Heck, I'm sure this is
so legible to everybody I may
launch into a mathematical explanation
of various public key cryptography
protocols.  Maybe even a few
dining cryptographers diagrams.
I think the MIME backers should do something that makes me want MIME.
Start posting such crucial diagrams and interesting formatted
documents, so that I feel like I'm losing something by not going to
MIME immediately.
I haven't really seen how MIME will enrich the discussion (and I use
that term loosely) here.  Crap like including a gif/jpeg of myself
with each post isn't exactly compelling.
