   [1]TheMeuge writes "The New York Times is reporting a new development
   in the unrelenting progress of the [2]RFID juggernaut. The school
   district of [3]Spring, Texas has adopted [4]RFID as a way to track
   students' arrival and departure. Upon being scanned, the data are
   transmitted to both the school administrators, as well as city police.
   I guess cutting class is no longer an option."
