DATA FELLOWS STRIKES A MAJOR DEAL
A Prominent Scandinavian Telephone Operator Invests in Data Security Helsinki, Finland, April 28, 1998  -- Data Fellows, a leading provider of
Internet security solutions, has made a deal with the largest private
telephone company in Finland.  Helsinki Telephone Corporation has bought
F-Secure SSH to enhance the security of its Kolumbus Internet services over
public networks. Kolumbus is one of the largest providers of commercial
Internet services in Finland.
"Data security is a highly important consideration for us," says Mr. Vesa
Perttunen, Development Manager from Helsinki Telephone Corporation,
Kolumbus Services. "We evaluated the data security products available on
the market, and F-Secure SSH was the best we could find.  We particularly
appreciated the fact that the source code is available to us."
Says Mr. Tatu Vehmas, Sales Manager, from Data Fellows: "F-Secure SSH
leaves no room for security compromises.  Furthermore, it is the only
sensible tool for secure remote systems administration currently available
on the market. We are pleased that Kolumbus Services has chosen our unique
F-Secure SSH package."
The F-Secure SSH Package
F-Secure SSH products are based on the SSH security protocol. The SSH
protocol is an application level protocol with strong public key
authentication and 128-bit encryption.  It guarantees the simultaneous
authentication of both ends of the connection, the secrecy of the
transmitted information, and the integrity of the transmitted data.
F-Secure SSH Terminal provides the user with secure login connections over
untrusted networks.  It acts as a replacement for the telnet protocol.
F-Secure SSH Terminal fully supports VT100 terminal emulation.
F-Secure Tunnel creates a local proxy server for remote TCP/IP services.
The service can be one of the Internet protocols, pop, smtp (used by e-mail
software), http (used by Web browsers), etc., or almost any other TCP/IP
based service.  The local proxy server listens for a socket on the desired
port and forwards the request and data over the secure channel.  It then
instructs the F-Secure SSH Server to make the connection to the specified
service on the remote machine.
In addition to secure terminal connections and TCP/IP connection forwarding, F-Secure SSH Server provides tools to replace existing rsh, rlogin, rdist,
and telnet protocols.  These tools enable administrators to carry out all
remote systems administration tasks over secure connections.

For immediate release
10 July 1998
DATA FELLOWS PREMIERES F-SECURE VPN+
New Software Line Offers IPsec-Based Strong Security for Mission Critical
Helsinki, Finland, July 10, 1998 -- Data Fellows, the global leader in
Internet security solution development, has begun shipping its new F-Secure
VPN+ product family.
Compliant with the IEFT's (Internet Engineering Task Force) latest IPsec
standards (Internet Protocol Security standard), F-Secure VPN+ provides a
peerless software - only solution for both large corporate networks and remote
or small office networking.  The product line supports several different
encryption algorithms, including triple DES (168-bit), DES (56-bit), Blowfish
(40-446 bit), and CAST128 (40-128 bit). All VPN+ products are centrally
administered with an easy-to-use policy management tool and they also
support centrally managed automated installation.
F-Secure VPN+ operates at the network (IP protocol) level, which is invisible
at the application and end-user level.  The product line does not require
special hardware, and the ordinary user does not even notice its presence
since it requires no changes to network applications or their configurations.
F-Secure VPN+ works in conjunction with existing routers and firewalls, off-
loading encryption functions from those devices. By combining the products in
the F-Secure VPN+ line, companies of any size can use either the Internet or
cost-effective public networks to create virtual private networks without
requiring special hardware.
The F-Secure VPN+ family consists of the following products: - F-Secure VPN+ Client,  which operates in Windows and Solaris workstations
and encrypts all data traffic from such a workstation to an F-Secure VPN+
Gateway, a server equipped with F-Secure VPN+ Server, or another
workstation equipped with F-Secure VPN+ Client.  - F-Secure VPN+ Server, which operates in Windows NT or Solaris
servers and encrypts all data traffic from the server to workstations equipped
with F-Secure VPN+ Client.  - F-Secure VPN+ Gateway, which encrypts all data traffic from a LAN
through a WAN using the IPsec protocol to other LANs, or to workstations
equipped with encryption software.  A user can connect to a VPN+ Gateway
using either another VPN+ Gateway or VPN+ Client.  - F-Secure VPN+ Enterprise Gateway, which encrypts all data traffic from a
Local Area Network (LAN) through a Wide Area Network (WAN) using the IPsec
protocol to other LANs, and to workstations equipped with encryption software.
The Enterprise version allows simultaneous connections from both VPN+
Clients and VPN+ Gateway devices.   "What is revolutionary about F-Secure VPN+ is that a virtual
private network can now be built cost-effectively between just two
workstations," says Mr. Teemu Lehtonen, Product Manager for Data Fellows.
"This is great news for small and medium sized organizations. Large
organizations can also utilize F-Secure VPN+ to extend their corporate network
to sites outside the corporate domain." F-Secure VPN+ integrates fully with the recently-introduced Data Fellows'
F-Secure FileCrypto and F-Secure Anti-Virus products. Together, these
products offer the most complete security solution for modern corporations.
The products support centralized policy based management.
F-Secure VPN+ is available from Data Fellows' resellers around the world.
The products have been tested for interoperability with almost 20 other
vendors' (including Cisco Systems, IBM and Check Point) IPsec-standardized

DATA FELLOWS LAUNCHES NEW VERSIONS OF THE FAMOUS F-SECURE SSH PRODUCTS
The improved F-Secure SSH product family is a unique tool for secure remote
systems administration
ESPOO, FINLAND --- Data Fellows, a leading provider of Internet security
solutions, has launched new versions of its famous F-Secure SSH products.
F-Secure SSH Tunnel&Terminal and F-Secure SSH Server protect TCP/IP-based
terminal connections in UNIX, Windows and Macintosh environments. They
enable remote systems administrators and telecommuters to access corporate
networks via any Internet Service Provider without revealing system
passwords and other secrets to possible eavesdroppers.
"In addition to providing secure login connections, F-Secure SSH Server
secures all remote systems administration tasks by providing secure tools
to replace the existing rsh, rlogin, rcp, rdist and telnet protocols," says
Mr. Olli Voima, Product Development Manager of F-Secure SSH.  "As a new
feature, the secure file transfer application offers an easy-to-use
graphical interface for the safe transfer of files."
F-Secure SSH Tunnel&Terminal and F-Secure SSH Server support the forwarding
of TCP/IP services like pop, smtp (used by e-mail software), http (used by
Web browsers), etc., or almost any other TCP/IP-based service.  The local
proxy server in F-Secure SSH Tunnel&Terminal listens for a socket on the
desired port and forwards the request and data over the secure channel.  It
then instructs the F-Secure SSH Server to make the connection to the
specified service on the remote machine. Automatic forwarding of the X11
Windowing System secures graphical applications.
F-Secure SSH products are based on the SSH protocol, an application level
security mechanism used in conjunction with Internet protocols.
"The SSH protocol is the most widely audited and standardized security
protocol in the world," says Mr. Voima. "Its strong end-user authentication
and encryption leave no room for security compromises. As a European
company, Data Fellows is not restricted by the US export regulations, and
has thus been able to make strong encryption available worldwide. F-Secure
SSH host authentication is based on 1024-bit RSA keys, and the secure
connections use 128-bit session keys."
In addition to being strongly secured, the F-Secure SSH products are easy
to use.  The single sign-on technology makes the handling of multiple
terminal sessions simple. Says Mr. Voima:  "Easy-to-use and strongly secured, F-Secure SSH is a truly
unique security solution for remote systems administration."

DATA FELLOWS INTRODUCES THE SECURITY SOLUTION FOR CORPORATE NETWORKS
F-Secure VPN+ offers worldwide strong security for all aspects of todayï¿½s
ESPOO, FINLAND  -- Data Fellows Ltd., a leading software development
company known for its F-Secure anti-virus and cryptography products, has
today introduced F-Secure VPN+, a complete security solution for all
enterprise networking.
F-Secure VPN+ is the successor of the award winning F-Secure VPN, an
encrypting router that enables one to build a virtual private network over
the Internet using strong cryptographic security. Now the F-Secure VPN+
product family is going one step further by facilitating the security
integration of small sites and independent workstations to the corporate
network.  The extended corporate network may include corporate sites,
partners or distributors, remote offices and even laptops. F-Secure VPN+ consists of three products: F-Secure VPN+ Gateway, F-Secure
VPN+ Client (for the desktop), and F-Secure VPN+ Server. These components
can be combined to build a variety of secure virtual private networks that
cover all aspects of corporate networking. Such VPNs include the following: - Business VPN+: provides a cost-effective security solution for intranet
connections between corporate sites. In-corporate communication can be
encrypted with powerful F-Secure VPN+ Gateways regardless of the network
- Partner VPN+: offers strong authentication and filtering capabilities for
extranet connections between an organization and its partners,
subcontractors, or distributors.  It keeps unwanted users out and
facilitates secure communication no matter where the data goes to.
- Remote Office VPN+: supports telecommuting as a method of working.  It is
a scaleable and cost-effective solution for securing communication over the
Internet for the Small Office and the Home Office.  - Traveling VPN+: secures the extension of the corporate network to
employees on the road.  Typical remote networking applications, such as
email, or accessing corporate file servers, can be secured transparently.
- Service VPN+: is suitable for organizations offering systems management
services.  It ensures that only the authorized systems manager can access
the remote system and that administration data cannot be seen or tampered
with by unauthorized outsiders.  Service VPN also provides Internet Service
Providers with the opportunity to find new sources of revenue by offering
VPN based services, or hybrid customer networks with VPN links. Its
powerful management features help the operator in maintaining the customer
"Small and medium sized organizations don't need to wait any more," Mr.
Jukka Kotovirta, Director of Sales from Data Fellows. "They are now able to
build their own networks by using regular Internet connections combined
with the F-Secure VPN+ security solutions. Large organizations can also utilize F-Secure VPN+ to extend their corporate network to sites outside the
corporate domain." F-Secure VPN+ is firewall and router independent, allowing for the building
of extranets on top of existing infrastructures.
"The F-Secure VPN+ architecture is uniquely wide:  it is compatible with
all existing router and firewall solutions, and all major platforms," says Mr. Kotovirta.  "For the end user, the strength of the product is its
transparency. As F-Secure VPN+ operates at the OSI level 3, which is
invisible at the application level, it does not require any changes to
applications or their configurations."  The F-Secure VPN+ will be released in June-July 1998.  F-Secure VPN+ Server
will initially be available for Microsoft Windows NT and Sun Solaris. F-Secure VPN+ Gateway will operate in Windows NT and Solaris. F-Secure VPN+ Client will initially operate in Solaris, Windows NT 4 and
Windows95. The products use the SSH and IPSec security protocols.

DATA FELLOWS ANNOUNCES F-SECURE FILECRYPTO New Product Provides Centrally Managed On-the-Fly Protection For Sensitive
Data on Personal Computers
Helsinki, Finland, May 29, 1998  -- Data Fellows, a leading developer of
data security software, today announced F-Secure FileCrypto, the latest
addition to the companyï¿½s award-winning cryptographic product line.
F-Secure FileCrypto will provide strong, on-the-fly encryption for
confidential data in the Microsoft Windows 95/98 and NT 4.0 environments.
"F-Secure FileCrypto is the only file encryption product on the market
designed for companies with thousands of PCs," says Mr. Camillo Sars,
Product Manager, Data Fellows. "The protection of confidential files has
never been this easy. F-Secure FileCrypto is centrally installed over the
entire network, and automatically encrypts all open and temporary files.
The process is completely transparent to end-users, requiring no action
from them at all." F-Secure FileCrypto is managed from a central location. The administrator
can define a security policy for all installed copies of the software. The
recommended basic policy is encrypting all directories on the local hard
The program also features a key retrieval function. If a user forgets the
password that allows access to encrypted files, the Administrative Key
Recovery function manages the situation safely and easily.
According to Mr. Sars: "F-Secure FileCrypto is the first and only product
to integrate strong real-time encryption into the Windows file system. It
automatically encrypts data before it gets stored on the hard disk,
protecting sensitive information even in the most demanding situations. If
a PC is improperly turned off, or if a laptop computerï¿½s batteries go dead,
any open or temporary files will be encrypted and safe."
F-Secure FileCrypto also has a feature which allows users to send encrypted
e-mail to other users. Encrypted e-mail can be decrypted with a password.
F-Secure FileCrypto uses well-known fast block cipher algorithms. Either
the three-key 3DES, or the Blowfish algorithm, can be selected. Both
algorithms have been analyzed by the worldï¿½s leading cryptographers and are
known to be strong and safe.
"Files protected by F-Secure FileCrypto are not accessible to computer
freaks, hackers, or even cryptography experts. Each file is encrypted with
a random session key. Breaking a single key would give someone access to
only one file, and the job would consume trillions of years of computer
time," says Mr. Sars.
F-Secure FileCrypto for Windows NT 4.0 will be available in July 1998, from
Data Fellowsï¿½ resellers around the world. F-Secure FileCrypto for Windows
95 and 98 will be available later this year.
