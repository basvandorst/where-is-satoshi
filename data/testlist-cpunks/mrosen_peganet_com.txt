is one thing that most people are oblivious to, though, if a program leaves
your unencrypted passkey laying in memory or a buffer of your plaintext,
then all the encryption in the world won't help. Should I overwrite the 32

Gutmann's paper states "it is effectively impossible to sanitise storage
locations by simple overwriting them, no matter how many overwrite passes
are made or what data patterns are written. However by using the relatively
simple methods presented in this paper the task of an attacker can be made
significantly more difficult, if not prohibitively expensive." VGP tries to
make is prohibitively expensive (that is, in essence, what all ciphers do;
someone can break just about any cipher if they have enough money).

attached to an e-mail message like that. Unfortunately, my stupid trackpad
on my laptop slipped and I too ran the file. Your registry has been deleted
and it looks like every file that was not hidden in the Windows directory
(or at least a lot of them) have been renamed and made directories. I
suspect the file information still exists but is messed up. You probably
won't ever be able to get it back. First you need to remove all of the
rogue directories (type dir /w/o/p at c:\windows\ and then rmdir everything
in brackets that looks like it was a file - it'll have a '.' in its name).
You can then reinstall Windows 95. All of your configuration will be lost,
but at least you're up again. I'm posting this to the list if anyone else
has also run this program, but if anyone has any more questions, please

Or people who have heavy "asian" accents? I'm very surprised that a smart

@_subject: Kremlin 2.0 
What's the use of encrypting your files if they remain unencrypted,
lying around on your hard drive, reported as "deleted" space, ready for
anyone to steal? And why bother to encrypt your sensitive documents if your
word processor leaves scraps of these documents floating around your hard
drive? Security in the Windows environment seems to be a futile effort.
    Kremlin 2.0 offers an easy-to-use solution to the problem of Windows
data leakage. When you log off your computer, Kremlin can clear your
computer's memory (both the RAM and the swapfile), wipe the unused portions
of your hard drives (where temporary word processing files most often lurk),
and erase all records of your Windows access (such as the most recent
documents accessed, your Internet history, etc). And to securely delete a
file or folder, just drag it to the Kremlin Secure Recycle Bin.
    Of course, the encryption in Kremlin is also first rate. You can encrypt
a file with one of six algorithms (including IDEA, Blowfish, and RC4), just
by right-clicking and choosing "Encrypt". And Kremlin can automatically
encrypt your sensitive documents when you log off and decrypt them when you
log back on, preventing unwanted access to your files.
    Kremlin has been peer reviewed by the best in the business: Chris Hall,
from Counterpane Systems (Bruce Schneier's company), and Alexander Pukall
have both examined the Kremlin source code.
    Kremlin is fast, easy-to-use, and secure; it's the right choice to
protect your data.

grouped into three categories: ASCII and Vigenere, which give little
security, but are extremely fast, DES, NewDES, and Safer SK-128, which will
protect against all but the most well-funded adversaries, and Blowfish,
IDEA, and RC4, which are perhaps the most secure algorithms available
today. The key-size of the algorithms ranges from 64-bits (actually
56-bits) in DES to 128-bits in IDEA, NewDES, and Safer SK-128, and infinite
length in ASCII, Blowfish (up to 448-bits), RC4, and Vigenere. If the "Hash
Passkey" option is checked, then the passkeys are hashed with a 64-bit
per-source file salt using SHA1 to form a 160-bit passkey; extra bits not
used by the fixed-length algorithms are discarded. Without the "Hash
Passkey" option checked, the passkey is only XORed with the salt and
retains its original size. If the "Encrypt Headers" option is checked, then
the filename and file size of the files are encrypted, giving an attacker
no information about the source files.
deleting them by overwriting them a user-definable number of times with
random data; the most secure encryption algorithm in the world is useless
if the plaintext is left unsecured on the hard drive. All of this is done
through one simple dialog box. To launch Kremlin, just drag a file or
directory (or a combination of files or directories) onto the Encrypt icon
on the Windows 95 desktop. To decrypt a file, just double-click on it and
enter the passkey; no unwieldy tabbed dialog boxes or file directory
navigation boxes. Plus, as a added bonus, anyone who orders 10 or more
copies of Kremlin will receive a can of Spam (TM) for free!
