@_subject: HELP! Some nut is threatening to sue! 
jim bidzos is not SOME nut
and this isnt a threat.. justa warning
the only problem i see with writing an apology note
would be if he didnt send you a letter in the first place
in my youth or if i were basically bored
i would have sent a letter looking like taht
from that account
i would assume its real cuz if someone were to fake it
they would act real mad adn say they are already suing
but i think the fact that you dont know if he really sent you the letter
(well i dont know if he really sent you the letter)
is proof of why we need pgp out in public
because that way we could verify who it was

@_subject: Wired cover 
well on mindvox the cover decision was announced a bit
before the magazine came out
and there was a huge guessing contest
over who was going to be on the cover
with some damn creative ideas
but anyhow...
although if i were to guess, i would say taht peter gabriel
is on the cover of my issue,
but on the inside it says cover: mitch kapor
so i got confused
dunno what mitch kapor looks like...
also to note la and sf have different covers
from what i ahve heard

@_subject: FOIA request 
the FOIA request looks very interesting
and im near positive that something is on me somewhere
just becuase i have the wrong type of friends who keep
me in their address books
but how bad will it look if i actually make the request?
and will it mean that i am more likely to have people pay attention to me?
and how much info shoudl i include about myself?

@_subject: CALLER ID? 
well i have the same problem because i am also on a pbx
system where you can call me by extension inside
or the 7 digit outside
but isnt/wasnt there a phone company number you could call
i forget what it was 631 4231 or something?
and besides.. 800 numbers get your phone number the same way your caller gets your number when you call collect
THEY ARE PAYING FOR THE CALL
they kinda have a right to know what they are paying for

@_subject: CALLER ID? 
i realize that caller ID box owners are not paying for your call but this system was talking about 800 numbers
two things i will grant
1) most 800 numbers are pro-watts or whatever it is and pay
just one huge charge a month and dont deal with each bill
seperately so they dont get charged for your specific call
BUT it is a great way to get marketting stuff
ive wroked for companies that do that
2) most peopel dont know that an 800 number isnt anonymous
but that goes to educating the public
and i really dont think the public cares enough to want to know

@_subject: Boycotts 
well i dont know about boycotting AT&T
if you do, i would reccomend that you write a letter
to them telling them EXACTLY why you dropped their service
because boycotting someone without telling them that you are doing it is pointless
i like AT&T more than Sprint or MCI as companies
but then again i used to work for AT&T
so im kinda biased...
but i can guarentee that SPrint and MCI are more evil than AT&T
and using ANI was something i did as part of my life
its how i worked out billing,
although it DOES provide a means for finding out
your phone number whne you might not want it known
its main use is billing
and NO, most people dont know about it
so what do WE do to educate them?
