Dating police indeed.  And as for this extra accusation, apparently admitted, that the sex was "unprotected"...
A condom wouldn't have been that much use anyway -- when you're f*ck*ng with Assange there's always the possibility of a leak.

Maybe this is old hat, but sorry, I'm not up on game stuff.  My son was
installing a game for me (after saving the world using crypto during the day,
I like to own b*tch*s for about 30 min a night just to wind down...) and the
game required us to install PunkBuster.  I demurred and did a quick search.
 It seems that punkbuster is rather aggressive and there are claims that it
will upload a txt file to their server, if it looks to be of interest.  I was
horrified, naturally.
My son's pc gets regularly infested and restored from a
partition image, and he does not keep any sensitive information on it, so pb
is fine for him.  But I have to be a little more circumspect.
Anyone know
about pb?  All I know is that it is pretty standard, but not actually owned by
any big game producer.  If there's a question mark over it, then I'll have to
put the game on an isolated machine.

Heard Rajiv Shah, president of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), on NPR this morning say that as the financial infrastructure was lacking in Afghanistan, it was non-trivial to pay people.  So they had a couple of pilot programmes where people were "paid on their mobile phones".
What do you think this entails?  The lack of infrastructure that makes Western style payment possible, would also make a mobile phone solution difficult (you have to use something accessible via your phone, in order to get afghanis in your hand in some local place).

@_subject: RSA hacked 
Anyone know what is going on?  RSA have been pretty cagey about it -- I know more about Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and the Japanese nuclear disasters combined than about what has actually happened at RSA.
If I had to guess, I'd guess that securid uses a super-master secret, from which they generate a master secret for each enterprise.  Then when RSA provisions a token for an enterprise, they generate the individual secret from the enterprise master secret.  I have not read up on securid for years.  The kind of fuss over this break-in would be consistent with someone stealing enterprise master secrets.
Any better conjectures?  Or, better still, any actual information?

@_subject: [cryptography] Key extraction from tokens (RSA SecurID, 
There seems to be a bit of uncertainty about this attack. B I'm hearing a lot of misunderstanding from customers. Here is my summary. B I'll first give a concrete example explaining key wrap and unwrap. B Skip this post if you know all this stuff. B Then I'll generalize a bit, and finally comment on RSA's response.
Suppose that you have a symmetric key (eg a KEK) in one HSM that you want to transport to another HSM. B The target HSM generates an RSA private key, and you send the cert off to the first HSM, where you wrap (encrypt) the symmetric key under that cert. B You take this wrapped key across to the target HSM. B There, you "unwrap" it, which means that you send the encrypted blob into the target HSM, which internally decrypts the symmetric key and stores it, but does not give you back the plain symmetric key.
If the target HSM notices that the encrypted blob is corrupted, then it will give you an error message. B This is a leak of information, but that's life. B Normally such a covert channel would at most help you to mount a brute force attack, which is impractical owing to the size of the key space and other things.
However, if the target HSM allows you to ask it to unwrap (decrypt) the key under the assumption that pkcs v1.5 padding has been used, then by careful manipulation of the encrypted blob, you can use the failed decryptions to deduce the plain key, after only a few thousand submissions.
It does not matter whether the symmetric key was encrypted using the pkcs1 v1.5 padding. (Matthew Green mentioned this in his post.) B The flaw in the HSM is that it will attempt to use the deprecated padding during the decryption. B Loosely, it looks for certain bytes and tells you whether it found them.
It also does not matter whether you are using pkcs11 APIs, and whether you are doing key wrap/unwrap, and whether the data is a key. B Any secret piece of data encrypted under an RSA cert can be potentially extracted, via any kind of crypto module, as long as the module will use the deprecated padding mechanism.
It also does not matter whether the device is actually a device. B  An SSL server that will decrypt things assuming pkcs1 v1.5 padding, and give failure messages, is potentially vulnerable (this has been known for a decade).
Various USB tokens have played the role of the HSM in the recent research. B How have RSA Corp. personned up? B The RSA blog said:
"The vulnerability outlined by the researchers makes it possible (however unlikely) that an attacker with access to the userbs smartcard device and the userbs smartcard PIN could gain access to a symmetric key or other encrypted data sent to the smartcard."B This is a fairish statement. B Though I think "unlikely" needs clarifying. B It's not that common for end users to do the importation onto such a device that leads to the attack, so in that sense it's unlikely. B However, if you do do such an import, the attack is likely. B I can certainly imagine provisioning scenarios that are vulnerable, though I can't say if people are actually doing them. B So I'd say that anyone using the tokens for this sort of thing should be warned immediately. B Also, the RSA blogger should have been a little more candid and conceded that they have been remiss, and said what they will do to fix it. B Later, they quote the token team:
"This is not a useful attack. The researchers engaged in an academic exercise to point out a specific vulnerability in the protocol, but an attack requires access to the RSA SecurID 800 smartcard (for example, inserted into a compromised machine) and the userbs smartcard PIN. If the attacker has the smart card and PIN, there is no need to perform any attack, so this research adds little additional value as a security finding."
This is quite false. B The legitimate owner of the token, or a security officer provisioning the token, can get information (marked unextractable) he is not supposed to get, PIN or no PIN. B There are definite real world scenarios in which this attack is a serious break.

@_subject: [cryptography] Key Checksums (BATON, et al) 
What's the received view on the worth of the parity bit in DES as a checksum?
 It can catch single bit errors in a byte, no double errors in a byte, and...
(it gets more complicated after that).  Most checksum mechanisms have a
somewhat rationally chosen set of things that they do and don't catch (e.g.
bursts).  But while you might make a case for the DES approach, it would seem
to be after the fact.  By utilizing those 8 bits to deal with some global key
errors you could presumably do better.  It just seems like they threw it in
without really caring.  But that seems unlikely.  Anyone know?

A friend of mine, not a security jock, recently needed to cleanse her system (computer system, that is). She was advised to download Malwarebytes.  So she went to Google, and selected the top hit.  It had the pale green background that indicates (to those who know) that it was a commercial hit.  Of course, she did not know that, but so what?  She merrily clicked on it.  It's Google's top hit, right?  Must be well-vetted, safe, etc.
The install led her through all sorts of other installs, and the end result was that she had a quite old version of Malwarebytes, and loads of adware on her computer.  She needed a very thorough cleaning then, to get rid of that stuff. Hope there's no malware left. Sheesh.
The point is that Google was boasting recently about its wonderful machine learning that, unprompted, detected bogus used car ads in China.  It's perfectly clear that they could check the nasty Malwarebytes repackager that paid them.  Pretty poor behavior on Google's part.

@_subject: Introduce randommess in keypress timings 
Alternatively all keystrokes could be done with fixed timing.  The point is that no individual pattern should be discernable.  There are more subtle aspects, such as jitter from perfectly regular timing, which could identify the machine/browser being used.  With added randomness, such jitter would be harder to discern.  Also, you would ideally not want eavesdroppers to know that you are obfuscating your keystrokes, and obfuscating via randomness, as opposed to fixed timing, would help with that.
There are quite a few companies selling keystroke dynamics products as an authentication factor.  There are also various efforts, such as one started at Stanford a few years ago, to monitor all aspects of a person's input, for continuous background authentication.  Not sure how that one's going.  Keystroke dynamics normally works on a short chosen phrase.  The latter stuff is more ambitious and extends that to arbitrarily long text, along with grammatical patterns, etc.  There is nothing new here.
After evaluating several products for a company I worked for, I built a keystroke dynamics product myself -- it was less work than going through the pain of registering for a trial of their software!  It was never used, for the same reason that kd is not used much -- it's more trouble than it's worth. It worked as well as any of the products being sold.
Though a key down or key up event from the Windows operating system has a timestamp in it (the OS will not give you more than a certain accuracy, but it's adequate), that timestamp is discarded and not available in Javascript.  My Javascript solution calls for a new Date as soon as it captures a key event.  People selling this stuff say that as there is too much potential lag between the key event and the time thus associated, Javascript is not good.  The best thing is something like an ActiveX  plugin or a native client in C that can capture the timestamp from the OS.  The next best thing was touted as Flash.  However, mine worked very well.
If anyone is interested I will describe in simple terms how one tests the keystroke vectors, and some of the challenges.

Well it does have an impact, but not enough to ruin things.  Of course it's not just js itself, but the browser, which swaps things in and out to do lots of things whenever it feels like it.
As requested, here are some details.  This is more technical than political, but may be of interest.  This concerns keystroke dynamics on a phrase known by the auth server, not the general background stuff. So we are not really talking about the passive spying/monitoring here, but rather a potential product. So after I wrote my keystroke dynamics proof-of-concept I discovered that the statistical technique had been patented 25 years before (the patent had expired), which validated my approach... Mine had some extra twizzlers though.
At Web browser-based initialization, the user sets a reference challenge word, say, "foobar". She must then enter some samples.  For each sample, a vector of 12 time values is created, one for each keyDown and keyUp event.  Some subtlety is needed in the programming, as keyUp on F might occur before keyDown on O on one sample, but after on the next.  We would like to compare apples to apples.
So we have a sample from the population of vectors as generated by the human.  When authentication is checked, we must measure the distance of our trial vector, from the population.  For this I used the Mahalanobis distance.  Mahalanobis was a well-known Indian statistician who in the 1930s designed a test in order to help anthropologists decide whether skull fragments found in caves matched each other.  This test measures the distance between each pair of entries in a vector.  So F-down and F-up are compared, and also F-down and A-down are compared.  Crucially, the distributions for each pair are normalized.  The vectors can have any numerical data in the components.  It can be used in botany with leaf area, weight, rainfall, etc.  It works beautifully for typing patterns.  Notice that we don't need to extract "dwell" times for keys, but all the same info is there in the more primitive array.
I set a configurable threshold of 20 for the distance triggering secondary authentication.  If I typed with proper focus, I would get distance of say around 4.  If someone else typed they would get say 70 or 150.  These are just typical examples.  It worked fine.  Here are some things I learned.
1. It's very hard to test objectively to make a business case.  Why?  Well if you go around the cubicles asking people to try it, you might get some people testing it on a laptop they don't normally use, or using some sort of random typing, on a string that they don't have an established pattern for.  I realized that KD is not magic.  Just as you would not expect to type a normal password "123456" by mashing the keys randomly, you have to consciously type in your official pattern for KD to work.  It is well-known that the best words for KD are things like your own name, for which you have a well-established pattern.  Now you see one of the reasons that this stuff has not taken off.  You might assiduously set the samples (or have passive background capturing working) on your usual desktop.  Then it will fail when you hunt-and-peck on your laptop.
2. I had a mobile developer add in touchscreen events for an iPhone test.  This uses character and time, and also x and y co-ordinates for both press and release (there is some drag).   The future will bring force.  The beauty of Mahalanobis is that these just go right in and work immediately.  Well, the stats does.  Dealing with these big fat vectors is not trivial.  I proved that it would work (actually it could not fail), but did not complete the mobile version.
3. I hacked the stats out in C.  Interestingly, for me it was harder getting the online demo going with the Web page, jQuery, PHP, and MySQL, than implementing the actual Mahalanobis test.  Maybe I should set the demo up for folks to try.
4. Twizzlers.  One is that I allowed arbitrary shifty characters in my phrase.  So in fact our user could simply tap her favorite rhythm on the Ctrl key, for her authentication factor.  Worked fine.
5. Hope the above was of interest...
