Not *that* much computer time...
In my copy of Hans Dobbertin's paper, the abstract says ``An implementation of our attack allows to find collisions for MD4 in less than a minute on a PC.''
As far as I know, the difficulty of inverting MD4 is still an open
problem -- but why would you want to use a broken algorithm like MD4
when you can use MD2, MD5, or SHA?

Hold on -- was the NSA rep talking about double encryption
*with two different independent keys*, or talking about double
encryption with the same key?
Somehow I doubt the latter: for starters, double encryption
with the same key with a stream cipher is generally a Bad Idea.
(Remember Robert Morris's suggestion to ``always look for
plaintext?'') In any event, double encryption with the same key is never
gonna be much more secure than single encryption, because it
doesn't increase the key space.
But if the NSA ref was allowing RC4 double encryption *with
two different independent secret keys*, then this *is* interesting!
There are well-known meet-in-the-middle attacks on double
encryption (with independent keys); but the standard one
requires lots of storage (2^40 storage -- this can't be
precomputed if you use 88 extra non-secret salt bits in the
key like SSL); a less well-known more recent attack doesn't
need the storage, but takes a bit longer (probably a few
hundred times longer) than brute force search of single
encryption.  van Oorschot & Wiener have a paper on this subject.
So did you use a SSL-like construction with lots of non-secret
salt bits in the key?
If not, then the 2^40 bytes of storage could be precomputed,
and I'd guess that this NSA position might mean that the NSA
has some Exabytes full of precomputed RC4 output for all possible
40 bit keys. :-)

Huh?  Are you sure you're not thinking of 2DES?
2DES is known to be not much more secure than DES: 2DES can be broken
with 2^56 operations and 2^56 space.  (The space requirements can be
eliminated without too much extra cost in time.)
Could you post a reference for your claim that 2-key 3DES is insecure?
Or post an attack?  Or anything?

Actually, as it turns out, van Oorschot & Wiener have a recent paper
which describes how to break 2DES without the huge space requirements
without sacrificing too much time (by using their parallel collision
search method).  They estimated the cost to break 2DES via specialized
hardware, and decided that breaking 2DES was only about 2^14 times as
costly as breaking DES.
The conclusion to take away from this is simple: double encryption
doesn't give you much extra security over single encryption.  Don't
use double encryption.

Hrmm, is this really unique to e-cash?  It sounds pretty similar to
traveller's checks.
(I do like your suggestion that e-cash service providers should write
a FAQ listing all the properties of their ``cash''!)

In article <199601100451.UAA13211 at infinity.c2.org>,
CERT normally won't publish a security warning until the manufacturers
have fixed the bug & offered a patch.  So I doubt the Win95/NT bugs will
be announced by CERT tomorrow.
If you want to publish a bug, CERT is probably not the best place to go.
CERT often ends up sitting on bugs for ages, because nobody knows about
the hole, so nobody can pressure the vendors to fix 'em, so CERT refuses
to release a bulletin-- a vicious cycle.
IMHO, embarassing public pressure often seems to be the quickest way to
get attention & fixes from uncooperative vendors...  But then again, that's
the old "full disclosure" (and "security through obscurity") debate(s).

Looks good to me -- I think that should work.
I guess that goes to show my lack of creativity. :-)
I was talking to Avi Rubin from Bellcore last night, and he speculated
that maybe the 64 bit key was a fixed one, generated once at installation
time and escrowed with the government then.
With a fixed pre-escrowed key, the receiver wouldn't have to do any
checking; and it would obviate the need for a LEEF/BARF/... field.
On the other hand, it seems to me like one should be able to disable
this fixed pre-escrowed key mechanism with a little binary patch.
I guess we need hard technical details.

Let's hack Lotus.
Let's put out a binary patch which defeats Lotus's GAK.
Let's look for weaknesses in their crypto implementation.
Time for me to go looking for a Unix version of Lotus Notes 4.

[suggesting that Alice encrypts 24 bits of key under NSA's public key,
    Bob repeats calculation and checks that the two LEAFS are the same]
No, you're wrong, the process you've described does not work.
Note that RSA normally is used as probabilistic encryption: encrypt the
same plaintext twice, and you'll likely get two different ciphertexts.
Thus, if RSA is used in the normal probabilistic way, the receiver can't
tell whether the sender was compliant.
Now you might suggest that the sender should not include probabilistic
padding, and use RSA deterministically, so that (somehow) the receiver
can check whether those 24 bits are correct.  That again won't work,
since a third-party eavesdropper will be able to do a 2^24 brute force
calculation to recover those 24 bits.
There are complicated ways to prevent a non-compliant copy of Lotus from
inter-operating with a compliant copy (as others on cypherpunks have kindly
pointed out), but they are complicated, and would require a re-design of
Lotus Notes' encryption module.  Since the export version is interoperable
with the non-export version, this would seem to require too much foresight
and work to be very likely.
In any event, I've heard that the export version of Lotus Notes 4 always
sends a LEAF, but the receiver never checks it.  So I think a simple binary
patch to change the NSA's public key should work.
P.S.  So does anyone know how large the NSA's public LEAF key is?
