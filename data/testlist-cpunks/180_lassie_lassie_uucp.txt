in 1875 you could get a colt .45 for a $20 gold piece. you still
I am sort of confused by all these folks talking about precious metals
as if they still have something directly to do with currency. I thought
they hadn't for some decades.
They have'nt, but some people are totally clueless as to some
things. That why they stay up all night and stare at their
computer screens (a kind of perverse sexual pleasure). I believe
Nixon took us of the gold standard in '73. People go to Economics
school for 6 years just to get paid $ 60k a year to be wrong with
their economic conclussions. By the way in the state of Arizona
there is still a law on the books that allow someone completing a
full stay in prison to recieve a good horse, $20 gold piece,
pistol, rifle and a sadle when released from prison. That is why
the state kicks you out one day early, even on a day for day
sentance. I know people that have attempted to sue to get their
horse etc. but lost.
