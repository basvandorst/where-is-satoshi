Note that although it's clear that this is only for proposing amendments, our
history leaves some doubt that's what would actually happen.  The current
constitution came ouf of a constitutional convention called under the Articles of Confederation to discuss amendments, but was finally enacted under
procedures *it* specified, not the procedures specified in the Articles.
Historically, Congress has always specified, at the time it proposes the
amendments.  I believe all but the repeal of prohibition were handled using
the legislature method.

But that wasn't the goal, at least not the stated goal.  The Convention
was called under the procedures specified in the Articles.  The Convention
itself decided to change the rules for ratification.
Congress specified in both (all) cases.  For the original prohibition
amendment, they submitted it to state legislatures.  For the repeal amendment, they submitted it to state conventions.

Whether it's problematic or not depends on your goals.  It gives reason to
doubt that your interpretation of the effects of a Convention called under the current constitution would hold, as (as you now say), such a Convention
has the power to change the rules by definition.
It didn't have to be:
Article. VII.
The Ratification of the Conventions of nine States, shall be sufficient for the Establishment of this Constitution between the States so ratifying the same.
There was a time period (I don't know how long, but certainly no more than
a few months) where some states were operating underthe Constitution and
others were still under the Acts.
I don't think it specifies, but what has always happened is that the *same
resolution* which proposes the amendment specifies which ratification method
will be used.
There's only a time limit because Congress has started specifying one, in the
same resolution which proposes the amendment and specifies the ratification
method.  (Exception: in the case of the ERA, I believe they later extended the
limit).  The power to specify a time limit isn't mentioned in the Constitution as you note, but has also never been tested.

The Convention did not.  It produced a document which, by ITS rules, went
into effect after having been ratified by 9 of 13 states, not all 13 as
required by Article XIII.
