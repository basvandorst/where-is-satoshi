Reply-To: orange at dns.list
     NCDNHC Last year alternate roots supported 0.3% of internet traffic.
This year alternate roots are supporting 5.5% of internet traffic.
The BIND study this year to date has ennumerated 60,513 dns (15% of
399,937 dns) of which 3,331 report they are using non-USG roots.
In my opinion - this is significant.  And it puts a whole new twist on the
song - what a difference a day makes.
