@_subject: Fix for pgp23a to make it 2.6 compatible 
I found a bug in pgp 2.3a : it's incompatible with pgp 2.6 messages made
after September first. Here's the fix, in both uuencode and pgp armored
format. Uudecode or pgp-extract this, and you will get a file called
fixpgp.com. Go into the directory where your pgp 2.3a DOS executable is
(pgp.exe) and run fixpgp. It should print "Done". That's it! 2.3a is now
fully compatible with 2.6. If it prints "File error" pgp.exe is either
not present or not writable. Fixpgp must be run with pgp.exe in the current directory. Do not run on anything but a virgin copy of the pgp23a
for dos distribution. If you compiled it yourself, modify the source as
described below.
