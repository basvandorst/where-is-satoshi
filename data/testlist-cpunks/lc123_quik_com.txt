@_subject: Question????? 
I recently downloaded potato for remailers including Mixmaster among others. I set up all my directories, have read approx all 50 pages of the how-to & help pages, and I still can't figure out how this program "works" let alone how to "use" it. I can't figure out where to compose the text body, where to save it to, what to call it, how to send it, etc etc etc etc....... Is there a place that offers instructions for the "instructions"???   It appears that all the text support is geared to those who really don't need it. Any help would greatly be appreciated. lc
