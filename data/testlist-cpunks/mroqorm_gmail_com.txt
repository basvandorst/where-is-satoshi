 - there was an open hardware version of this
somewhere, but maybe all that went away when they got a new name and a
hipster website ... not for the purpose you are discussing but still

the security you get from an .onion address isn't all that great, you
know. new hidden service names will be a lot longer. also having some
certification that it is actually run by them is useful (but ... but
... ca trust! i don't give a fuck right now)
there are enough reasons for people to use this - while people
apparently have their accounts locked when they try to log in through
this, i assume that is a kink they will deal with better in the
future. in a hostile network, i'd trust a tls secured hidden service
more than anything else i have at my disposal
also, facebook may be crap but it is just another platform to be used
to communicate with people - you may not want what you post associated
with your network location or your person - a lot of people also use
twitter "anonymously" in the same way, why discriminate platforms it
is all the same shit (i said to a fellow gmail user)
not everything is about hiding - if you wanted that, say goodbye to
modern society
