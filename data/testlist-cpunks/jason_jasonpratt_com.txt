Hey Mike, it's simple. The silver base is the ratio of the FRN face value to
the silver content. It has to fluctuate because, unlike in every other sound
money period in history, you and I live in a time where there's a
[relatively] free market for precious metals.
Except that there are 1,500 Redemption Centers and over 10,000 users of the
currency who are doing that right now! I just exchanged about $130 in ALD on
a trip to Las Vegas in four days. Could have done a lot more if I hadn't
been attending a trade show most of the time...I've been using it for almost
a year now and trust me, it works.
