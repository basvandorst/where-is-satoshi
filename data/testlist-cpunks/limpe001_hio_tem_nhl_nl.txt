@_subject: Commercial version of PGP 
Hi,  I got a question from a Polish PGS user who wants to know wheter he
 can make a commercial version of PGP for Europaen users.
 He mentioned the Swiss patent holding of IDEA, but he wasn't able to  contact the people over there as the fax/phone numbers were disconnected. :-|
 Does anyone with a bit legal knowledge know anything about this?
 i.e. does he have to obtain licenses from RSA (although he only plans to
 export in Europe) and from the patent holders of RSA.
 And how about Phil ? Does Philip Zimmermann allow this kind of usage of his
 code ?

When your Microsoft Mail supports an external Editor, you might
want to try PGS (Pretty Good Shell), available as PGS099B.ZIP at several ftp sites.
It enables you to run PGP from a shell, with a easy way to edit/encrypt
When you can't find any site which has the above file, send me a private
mail, and I'll mail you a copy.
