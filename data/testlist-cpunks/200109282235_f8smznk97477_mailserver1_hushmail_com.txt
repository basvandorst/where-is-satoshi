ANNOUNCE: ssldump: an SSL protocol analyzer
Version 0.9b2
RTFM, Inc. is pleased to announce the availability of ssldump 0.9b2.
ssldump is an SSLv3/TLS network protocol analyzer. It identifies TCP
connections on the chosen network interface and attempts to interpret
them as SSLv3/TLS traffic. When it identifies SSLv3/TLS traffic, it
decodes the records and displays them in a textual form to stdout. If
linked with OpenSSL and provided with the appropriate keying material,
it will also decrypt the connections and display the application data
ssldump is completely passive and thus allows you to analyze systems
without interfering with them. You can also use it to read stored
traffic collected with tcpdump. This release is version 0.9b2. The code quality is considered to be
late Beta. It has seen extensive testing on a number of Unix
platforms including FreeBSD, Solaris, HP/UX and Linux. It uses
autoconf and should be portable to most Unix-based systems.

port has seen rather less testing and so is corresponding less
