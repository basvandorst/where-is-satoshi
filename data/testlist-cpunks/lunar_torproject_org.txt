Tor Weekly News                                        August 14th, 2013
Welcome to the seventh issue of Tor Weekly News, the weekly newsletter
that covers what is happening in the fast-paced Tor community.
New Tor Browser Bundle releases
Last week events [15] sparked a good amount of discussions on Tor
Browser usability.  Several discussions on tor-talk and in other places
revolved around the idea that “JavaScript should be disabled by
default”. scarp wrote a good summary [16] on why it is not so simple: “I
understand that JavaScript was enabled globally in the Tor Browser
Bundle for usability reasons as well as to prevent browser
fingerprinting. […] If the torproject were to disable it by default,
that would not ensure that users are protected in the future by similar
methods. Sites can be written in a way that if you do not allow
JavaScript they simply won’t work at all. If I was writing an exploit
I’d do this to frustrate users so hopefully they enable JavaScript and
accept my exploit.“ Roger Dingledine also improved [17] the relevant
question in Tor FAQ [18].
One possible solution to satisfy contradicting requirements would be to
add a “security slider” [19] that would allow users to easily trade off
web compatibility over security. The slider would have three or four
different positions that would gradually deactivate more and more
features of the browser. One has to understand that the “most secure”
should probably disable loading of any pictures. This also impacts the
Tor Browser anonymity set but this is probably a trade off that can be
afforded given the actual size of the Tor Browser user base.
scarp had also pined another big usability problem related to updating:
“This exploit wasn’t new. […] Users running the latest Tor Browser
Bundle didn’t have any issues as their browsers had been patched. It is
inappropriate for a web browser to not be automatically updated.” Nick
Mathewson went back [20] on the latest plan that was discussed during
the last summer dev. meeting [21] to simply build upon Firefox update
mechanism. The next step is to do a proper review. Hopefully, given it
is “mature and widespread” and has been “proven to update Firefox”, we
will not “run screaming for the hills” when looking at the
On a more general level, an unexpected comment came from Brendan Eich
(Mozilla’s chief technology officer) on Twitter [22]: “Maybe we should
just adopt, support, and bundle Tor in Firefox...”  David Dahl
subsequently opened a bug report in Mozilla’s tracker to discuss a way
forward [23]. Mike Perry commented on a thread [24] on the
liberationtech mailing list: “In short, I am excited by this news, and I
look forward to improving our communication and cooperation with Mozilla
on this front.”

Tails 2013 summit
On Monday, Nick Mathewson robbed everyone of his “I’m a little teapot”
performance [32] by releasing the following three new proposals:
Proposal 219 [33] has been written a year ago by Ondrej Mikle. It is
currently at draft stage. Its goal is to make Tor support any DNS query
type and also support full DNSSEC resolution. The latter is important as
it provides “protection against DNS cache-poisoning attacks” but is made
tricky given a routine hostname resolution with DNSSEC “can require
dozens of round trips across a circuit”.
In another draft proposal [34], Nick Mathewson describes a plan for a
smooth transition from the current 1024-bit RSA keys used for router
identity and TLS links to Ed25519-SHA-512 [35] keys. Several small
details still have to be ironed out.  This proposal does not address
hidden service keys. They will have to be addressed in another proposal
once an agreement has been reached regarding the best crypto
scheme [36].
Now that the ntor onionskin handshake [37] has been implemented in
0.2.4, we could get better forward secrecy by having clients top sending
CREATE_FAST cells. Nick Mathewson has issued proposal 221 [38] to detail
the reasons and the implications of such change.
All these proposals are now up for discussions on the tor-dev mailing
  [32]

Miscellaneous news
Below is a summary of some frequent questions received at the Tor help
desk this past week:
Users are frequently confused by the message they receive from GetTor.
Currently the Tor Browser Bundle is too large to send over GetTor, so
users instead receive three mirrors with a link to a page with all
available translations of the Tor Browser Bundle. Many users email the
help desk unsure of what this page means or which package they need.
A number of users asked whether or not they needed to disable JavaScript
in the Tor Browser Bundle. While the vulnerability in Firefox does not
affect the latest Tor Browser Bundle, disabling JavaScript globally will
reduce one’s risk of being affected by future JavaScript exploits. Users
were asked to choose for themselves between greater protection inside
the browser or a browsing experience with more functionality enabled.

Please look at the SSLS patch if you want to stick to Mailman:
Schleuder has a small but growing userbase:
It is available in Debian and counts Tails as one of its users.

that covers what is happening in the great Tor community.
Future of pluggable transports integration
Moritz Bartl from torservers.net [18] posted an update [19] on their
ongoing crowdfunding campaign to support Tor exit bandwidth. The fund
just went over €3000, and there are still a few days left!

A Flattr-like incentive for Tor relays?
The new release of Orbot 12.0.3 comes with a shiny new icon and
graphics, bugfixes, and Tor 0.2.4.16-rc. You can download the update via
Google Play [24] or straight from Guardian Project’s website [25].

talk [29] about “the safety of the Tor network which focused on network
diversity, relay operators, and misbehaving relays.” The former Tor GSoC
student Brandon Wiley also gave an update [30] on Dust — “an Internet
protocol designed to resist a number of attacks currently in active use
to censor Internet communication.” [31]

George Kadianakis has sent two new proposals to improve hidden service
identity key security [33] and prevent address enumeration [34]. TWN

Help Desk Roundup
Users experience confusion when trying to update the Tor Browser Bundle.
Users are not always aware that the Tor Browser Bundle does not have an
autoupdate function. Some users will download the latest release from
the Tor Project website, then ask “Ok, what do I do now?”. We recommend
closing the browser, then deleting one’s current Tor Browser folder
before unpacking the new download.
One person asked for help while using the Pirate Browser.
Torrent-sharing website The Pirate Bay released the Pirate Browser this
week as a fork of the Tor Browser Bundle. The Pirate Browser is not
endorsed or recommended by the Tor Project. It is unclear what the
advantages are compared to using the Tor Browser Bundle and no source
code is available.

Welcome to the fifteenth issue of Tor Weekly News, the weekly newsletter
that covers what's happening in the world of Tor — “king of high-secure,
low-latency anonymity” [1].

New tranche of NSA/GCHQ Tor documents released
Roger Dingledine announced [6] the first alpha release in the tor
0.2.5.x series, which among many other improvements introduces
experimental support for syscall sandboxing on Linux, as well as
statistics reporting for pluggable transports usage on compatible
Roger warned that “this is the first alpha release in a new series, so
expect there to be bugs. Users who would rather test out a more stable
branch should stay with 0.2.4.x for now.” 0.2.5.1-alpha will not
immediately appear on the main download pages, in order to avoid having
too many versions listed at once. Please feel free to test the new
release [7], and report any bugs you find!
   [6] 
   [7] 
How did Tor achieve reproducible builds?
A number of users wanted to know if Tor was still safe to use given the
recent news that Tor users have been targeted by the NSA. We directed
these users to the Tor Project's official statement on the subject [33].
One of the most popular questions the help desk receives continues to be
whether or not Tor is available on iOS devices. Currently there is no
officially supported solution, although more than one project has been
presented [34, 35].
The United Kingdom is now one of the countries where citizens request
assistance circumventing a national firewall [36].

Welcome to the sixteenth issue of Tor Weekly News, the weekly newsletter
that covers what’s happening in the venerable Tor community.
Making hidden services more scalable and harder to locate
The Tor project wishes to expand its support channels to text-based
instant messaging as part of the Boisterous Otter [11] project. Lunar
and Colin C. came up with a possible implementation [12] based on the
XMPP protocol, Prosody [13] for the server side, and Prodromus [14] as
the basis for the web based interface.
This week, multiple people asked if Tor worked well on the Raspberry Pi.
Although the Tor Project does not have any documentation directed
specifically at the Raspberry Pi (yet!), the issue was raised on Tor’s
StackExchange page [15]. Tor relay operators are encouraged to share
their experiences or ask for help on the tor-relays public mailing
list [16].

Welcome to the tenth issue of Tor Weekly News, the weekly newsletter
that covers what is happening in the skyrocketing Tor community.
Serious network overload
This week Tor help desk saw an increase in the number of users wanting
to download or install Orbot. Orbot can be downloaded from the Google
Play store, the Amazon App store, f-droid.org, and guardianproject.info.
Guides on using Orbot can be found on the Guardian Project’s Orbot
page [32], or on the Tor Project’s Android page [33]. It looks like
Orbot is currently inaccessible from the Google Play store in Iran.
