Hi Robert,
Have the link here, but after further reading of the section, it would seem
that it was not really your article, just a quote of it. I simply read the
top section and assumed it was yourself replying to the comments, but after
further analysis it would seem not.
Heres the link anyways:
Im still trying to source this doc, and quote from that page:
(This is of course the section I missed :-) )
If you are aware, would I contact Black Unicorn or MFarncombe in this
regard? Im still not too clear who is replying to whom on the article.
Thanking you
Fabrizio Astengo
