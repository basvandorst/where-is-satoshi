@_subject: Zimmermann case is dropped. 
Excerpts from internet.cypherpunks: 12-Jan-96 Re: Zimmermann case is
drop.. by John Young at pipeline.com And in today's Washington Post, in an article by Elizabeth Corcoran:
   William P. Keane, assistant U.S. attorney in San Jose, declined to
   explain why the government closed its investigation of Zimmermann,
   citing the Justice Department's policy of not commenting on reasons
   for dropping a case.
   There is "no change in law, no change in [encryption] policy," he
   said. "If you're planning on making encryption available over the
   Internet . . . or other means, better check with the State Department
   first."
