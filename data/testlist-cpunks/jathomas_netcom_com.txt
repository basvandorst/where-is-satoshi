You might start with van Eck, Wim, "Electromagnetic Radiation from Video Display Units:  An Eavesdropping Risk?", Computers & Security 4 (1985) 269-286.  That will give you the technical basics.
If someone has actually seen Tempest interception in action, I'd like to hear about that as well.

@_subject: Simple hardware RNGs 
Having built devices for generating random data, I can tell you the problem is more difficult than it appears.  The problem is removing biases and correlations from the process.
A good place to start is Murry, Herschell, "A General Approach for Generating natural Random Variables", IEEE Transactions on Computers, December 1970, p. 1210-1213.

@_subject: EE Times on IDEA 
My implementation of IDEA on the TI TMS320C26 DSP runs at 99 kbytes/sec.
I havent't tried DES, but comparing DES code on the 80x86 to the 'C26 instruction set, I think the speeds would probably be about the same.
Whatever, these speeds leave plenty of time for simple speech coding in a voice encryption system.

@_subject: Random Number Generators 
You might find this article instructive:  Herschell F. Murry, "A General Approach for Generating Natural Random Numbers," IEEE Transactions on Computers, December 1970, p. 1210.
A fairly recent patent uses your approach of two oscillators:  No. 4,855,690 by Dias, assigned to Dallas Semiconductor Corp., "Integrated Circuit Random Number Generator using sampled output of variable frequency oscillator."
I'd suggest using Johnson noise; reverse-biased diodes generate noise which is pink.  Ive built devices using amplified Johnson noise, squared up with a comparator, then averaged by a D flip-flop.  The preliminary results look pretty good.  Please post your results here -- and good luck. John A. Thomas
