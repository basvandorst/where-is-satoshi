Flawed Theory, Not Facts
Dear Mr. Hallam-Baker,
If you knew anything about the academic debate over "path dependence" ("network externality") theory you would know that the work by our research fellows, Stan Liebowitz and Stephen Margolis, has been appearing in the leading, scholarly, peer-reviewed, economics journals for the past ten years.  They have conclusively shown that "network externality" theory has absolutely no empirical evidence. And, no economists or any others have been able to show any errors in the devastating Liebowitz/Margolis analysis.  Indeed, hundreds academic economists have signed our Open Letter agreeing with this As a belief system without any scientific evidence and with people such as yourself who accept this urban legend without proof, "path dependence" is a house of cards that is being used to advance the corporate welfare ambitions of various major business and government interests.  In so doing, the Microsoft case has nothing to do with consumer welfare and everything to do with corporate welfare.  (For your information, it was the acclaimed, New Left historian Gabriel Kolko who first showed how antitrust has been used repeatedly for corporatist purposes since its initial adoption.)
So, since you have obviously not even seen the Liebowitz/Margolis book, WINNERS, LOSERS & MICROSOFT: Competition and Antitrust in High Technology, and you apparently prefer to defend the blatant campaign for corporate welfare (antitrust protectionism), who indeed is the crank and right-winger here?
Incidentally, so you do not continue to embarrass yourself, I would suggest you first learn the difference between the terms, "network effects" and "network externalities."  Reading the book, WINNERS, LOSERS & MICROSOFT, would make an excellent way to do so.

Dear Phill,
Despite your repeated claims in this regard, we have presented the links to our work so that anyone can review this analysis themselves and make up their own minds.  Clearly you have not examined our book by Liebowitz and Margolis, WINNERS, LOSERS & MICROSOFT ( and hence we are still waiting for you to so and then indicate how you believe the analysis by Liebowitz and Margolis might be erroneous.  Your otherwise objecting to this work simply because you do not agree with the conclusions is hardly the basis for any serious, scientific discussion of the merits of the work.
Best regards,

Dear Matt,
Great for you to point out this important aspect of the U.S. war campaign.
Considering the altitude at which these drops are being made on pallets, the further question is whether such drops might actually be viewed by the Afghani people as the U.S. dumping garbage since that is likely what the cargo will be upon impact.
