@_subject: [Bitcoin-development] 0.8.4 released, fixes critical denial-of-service issue 
Bitcoin-Qt version 0.8.4 is now available from:
  This is a maintenance release to fix a critical bug and three
security issues; we urge all users to upgrade.
There were no changes from 0.8.4 release candidate 2, so if you are running
0.8.4rc2 you do not need to upgrade.
Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github:
  How to Upgrade
An attacker could send a series of messages that resulted in
an integer division-by-zero error in the Bloom Filter handling
code, causing the Bitcoin-Qt or bitcoind process to crash.
Bloom filters were introduced with version 0.8, so versions 0.8.0
through 0.8.3 are vulnerable to this critical denial-of-service attack.
A constant-time algorithm is now used to check RPC password
guess attempts; fixes Implement a better fix for the fill-memory-with-orphan-transactions
attack that was fixed in 0.8.3. See
for a description of the weaknesses of the previous fix.
Bugs fixed
Fix multi-block reorg transaction resurrection.
Fix non-standard disconnected transactions causing mempool orphans.
This bug could cause nodes running with the -debug flag to crash.
OSX: use 'FD_FULLSYNC' with LevelDB, which will (hopefully!)
prevent the database corruption issues many people have
experienced on OSX.
Linux: clicking on bitcoin: links was broken if you were using
a Gnome-based desktop.
Fix a hang-at-shutdown bug that only affects users that compile
their own version of Bitcoin against Boost versions 1.50-1.52.
Other changes
Checkpoint at block 250,000 to speed up initial block downloads
and make the progress indicator when downloading more accurate.
Thanks to everybody who contributed to the 0.8.4 releases!
