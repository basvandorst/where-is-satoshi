@_subject: Privacy book list 
I got the ad (and a subsequent review copy, upon request) after we published the first issue of the Journal of Law & Technology on the web.  It appears that they got my name, and address, from the web (both are displayed in the "Contacting the Journal" page).
I haven't had much time to read the book, but my recollection is that it is somewhat misguided in its analysis of privacy online.  Its historical perspective is fairly thorough, however.
