Why "the bank", rather than "all banks"?  If there is a single
cryptographic point of failure in a widely used ecash system,
it seems unlikely that diversity would buy you anything.  The
worry would not be the compromised keys of a single bank, but
rather, say, an effective cryptanalysis.  I would put this in
the supernova class; it may be just as unlikely.

No, he's saying to equalize wall-clock time---just pad out beyond the
largest possible execution time with a timer.  Surely with a sufficient
pad the timing-channel leak can be made negligible (though the author

Kocher says this about padding to constant time:
Perhaps, but an attack would be much more difficult if the monitoring must
be done outside the host doing the computation (viewing a router from

channels is much reduced.

@_subject: Sources of randomness 
I'm puzzled by the implication that thermal noise or avalanche or Zener
noise is somehow inferior to noise from radioactive sources.  It's not.
Take as an example Johnson noise, the voltage noise from a
resistance.  It's the result of the interaction of vast numbers
of electrons.  It is unpredictable in the same way that individual
radioactive decay events are unpredictable, and they are both
results of friendly quantum mechanics.
Small biases/interferences that come from nonideally sampling such
voltages do not matter, since the entropy is still 1-epsilon bits per
sample (more for nonbinary samples).  There is no "chink in the
armor" available for cryptanalysis---the user need only acquire
N*(1+epsilon) random bits rather than N bits.
The video-snow-noise described by Tim May is mostly Johnson noise
in the low-noise-amplifier electonics, not atmospheric or ionospheric
noise, at least above 50 MHz or so.

Point taken; it sounds like I misread your post a bit.  Certainly
it's better to have a robust implementation than a delicate one,
but let me argue how hard it might be to get electronic sources
But how wrong is wrong?  Unless the design is catastrophically bad,
a zener source is going to give you zener noise plus some slight
admixture of interference.  Say the designer is extremely careless
and there's deterministic interference 20 dB down.  I don't see
how even that matters cryptographically---the resulting loss in
entropy will be millibits per sample.
Perhaps there ought to be a couple of standard random-bit-source
implementations, say at the CMOS-standard-cell and board-subsystem
levels, that are widely vetted and trusted (and used!).  But it's
mostly a solved problem, seems to me.
A radioactive source might be okay at the board level (though probably
costlier than its electronic counterpart), but it'd be a pain to
integrate, and it might disturb the rest of the chip.  (I'd like to
have a get_random_bit instruction as part of a microprocessor, for
example.)  Also if you want a high rate of random bits, you need many
decay events, whereas for electronic sources the corresponding
bandwidth is free---Johnson and shot noise are flat to 1 THz or so.
Interestingly enough, zener diodes and particle detectors are a lot
alike.  Zeners, if they're avalanching, already have some internal
gain; each electron crossing the junction gets so hot it knocks
off other electrons, and there's a chain reaction.  Particle detectors
take the ion trail in a suitable environment and make a nice
big pulse out of it with a similar chain-reacton effect (though
the fancier kind will give you the actual amount of charge).

@_subject: Hardware-random-bits interface 
I've been thinking about physically random bits recently, so
I'd like to offer a simple, easily implementable interface to a
source of such bits, along with a design sketch using a common
radio receiver chip as the noise source.  The interface consists
of two bits in the standard PC parallel port, one serving as
the data line and the other the sampling clock.
The parallel port, while a bit less universal than RS-232, eliminates
the complexity of UARTs and clock generation and offers higher speed
and friendlier local power.  For an ISA bus running at 8 MHz, bits can
be sampled at about 2.5 Mb/s, i.e., about 300 kB/s.  (The bandwidth of
the noise source should of course be consistent with this.)  Another
advantage of a simple device is that it can be thoroughly inspected:
there is no PLD or microcontroller code to vet/trust.
Not all parallel ports have bidirectional data registers, so the
most general path is to assign a status bit to the input and
use a control bit for the clock output.  I'm using bit 4 of
the status register (pin 13 on the PC's DB-25) as the input
and bit 0 of the control register (pin 1) as the clock.
Specifically, the rising edge of pin 1 should sample the noise
waveform and present the result on pin 13.  (Pin 1 is inverted,
so bit 0 should transition from 1 to 0.)
I'd also like to suggest a device name for the Unix environment,
bits returned be as raw as possible, as close to the physics as
possible, leaving any debiasing/hashing to other software (for
example, the /dev/random implementation in recent Linux kernels).
(I have a Linux device driver that implements this interface;
it is very simple, needing only to sample the bits, pack them
into bytes, and manage mutual exclusion, filesystem housekeeping,
and probing.)
Here are the particulars of the "dongle" board I'm in the
process of making.
  Noise source:  an FM/IF radio receiver chip, with no input
    supplied, so that the IF amplifier chain produces wideband
    noise at its output.  I'm looking at the Motorola MC13158
    and the Philips SA626.  Each provides about 20 MHz of
    IF bandwidth, and the Motorola part has an on-chip
    comparator, reducing the entire device to two chips:
    the receiver chip and an HCMOS flip-flop.
  Power:  from the port data lines; >=3.5V at about 20 mA is
    available.
  Device probing:  the device should somehow identify itself
    as a random bit generator.  One way to do this is to wire
    one of the parallel port data bits to a status line; for
    example, data bit 0 (pin 2) could be wired to status bit 5
    (pin 12).  Software can then twiddle the data bit and
    watch for the response.
  Cost:  around $10 in parts, I guess.
A rate of 300 kB/s will make a 600 MB one-time pad in an hour
(assuming software is similarly fast).  I'm wondering if any
of the mail systems have convenient hooks to use pads (though
it would not be difficult to write up).
Suggestions welcome.  I'll put the design on the Web
once it's finished; replicating it should be pretty easy.
People can also grab the device driver if they wish.

@_subject: Hardware-random-bits interface 
It may have been misleading to refer to a radio receiver chip:  the
noise generated by the chip will be entirely internal.  It doesn't
depend on any external signal "sneaking in"; the noise comes from
the effective resistance of the first amplifier stage.  Nothing
is being "received", in some sense; it's just a big hunk 'o gain.
A Zener diode would be fine, but the design is a bit more complex,
especially for wide bandwidths---you need to mess with biasing
voltages, speedy op-amps, interface to CMOS, and all that jazz.
You'd need external power (or a DC-DC converter).  I wanted a
super-simple design that people could just plonk down on a PC
board.  Two chips and some bypass capacitors.

@_subject: why compression doesn't perfectly even out entropy 
No, he's correct; cryptanalytic schemes like those you mention rely
on statistical toeholds *in the context of a deterministic cipher
algorithm*.  For one-time pads that are "cooked" or "screened" (and
I agree that it's a silly thing to do), the toehold is much weaker,
infinitesimal in fact.
For example, suppose we take 1024-bit blocks from a physical RNG
(which we'll agree is "good", has entropy close to 1024 bits,
whatever that means).  There are 2^1024 such blocks.  Obtain one
and apply the magical test---if the block fails, toss it in the
bit bucket. Suppose, conservatively, that half the sequences fail.
The cryptanalyst now knows that the plaintext cannot be
( failed_pad xor ciphertext ) for any of the 2^1023 failed_pads.
Thus, it must be one of the other 2^1023.  This is the *only*
toehold he gets.

in embedded systems like mass storage.

While a scheme like this will work, one of the needs in a design like
this is convincing yourself of how much entropy is available from the
noisy clock and where it comes from.  It's nontrivial to evaluate
the phase noise of a CMOS relaxation oscillator, for example.
Also, at what rate do you want random bits?
The references in Applied Cryptography are pretty useful; the only other
ones I know of are a tech report by Gifford at MIT/LCS and a thesis
by Sridhar Vembu (who also works here at Qualcomm) on optimal extraction
of entropy from biased sources.
I'd say thermal noise is your friend; the other systematics, as you
say, are a slight issue, but their effect on the entropy is very small
and they'll be taken out by the postprocessing (hash function, etc.).
I plan to make a simple board-level RNG design available to the net Real
Soon Now.  I'd be interested to see your CMOS design when it's finished.
(By the way, try searching the cypherpunks and sci.crypt archives on the
subject. There's lots of good discussion.)
