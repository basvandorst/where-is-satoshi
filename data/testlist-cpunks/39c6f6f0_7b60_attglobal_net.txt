My god!  Did you stay up all night to find this?  It seems quite clear to me that the vast majority of the website is focused on man/teen relationships.  Even so, if this were a website advocating man/baby relationships, especially those that included horses it would not affect my position one bit.  These people have the right for their information to be put into the public forum.
