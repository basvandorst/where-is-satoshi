Andy, maybe you or someone else has some insight into something I've
wondered about:
Is there a secure way to timeshare a single entropy source such as an
entropy key? High-quality entropy sources are often fragile, expensive, or
difficult to manufacture and maintain. If Alice has a friggin' amazing
entropy source, and Bob wants to use it from afar, what would be the best
way for Alice to let Bob retrieve data from the entropy source when she
wasn't using it?

Has anyone tried using an entropy broker (see
 for sharing entropy between devices on a
physical network?  seems to
suggest that this is something that people do.

Interestingly, review of this document was reopened for public comment a

Looks like the version that nytimes links to can be found
It hasn't been confirmed that Dual EC DRBG is used for anything important
in practice, AFAIK. See

want to ever access it over SSL! (only in the development branch right now, should be released soon)
