Well said Tim.  Treason's posts, for the past week, have been like the
rantings of a third grader.  I'm just glad some people on this list have the
resources to prove him wrong.
Oh.. and what kind of prices are we talking about to, say, TEMPEST a small
room.. maybe enuf for a workstation and misc. accessories.  |-]
