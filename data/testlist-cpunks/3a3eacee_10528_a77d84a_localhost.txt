I fired 2 of my original 8 staff members for browsing the mailbox of users.
I Know several people who work in both the Big national ISP and the small mom and pop ISP
at a tech level,  to a CEO level. I KNOW that, security notwithstanding, email browsing
across the server isn't that uncommon of an occurrence.
