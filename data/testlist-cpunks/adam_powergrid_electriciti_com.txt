@_subject: New Windoze PGP Shell (freeware)  worth checking out 
AEgis Research (who I know nothing about) has come out with a very pleasant
windows fron end for PGP. It is bone-head compliant, and even works well in
Win95. I'm only plugging because I was so impressed. Until Eudora has PGP
hooks, this is my shell of choice.
