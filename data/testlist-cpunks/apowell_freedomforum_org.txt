Once again the Net had it first, this time by accident...
ABC News election-eve Net 'mistake'
                  accurately predicted most close races                   By Adam Clayton Powell III
                  World Center                   11.4.98
                  It did not happen, but just imagine if it had:
                  The night before Fox television aired the World Series,
the Fox Web site posts
                  a complete set of inning-by-inning box scores for the                   Yankees-Padres games. After leaving the results online for
a while, Fox pulls
                  them down and says it was all a big mistake.
                  Then the Yanks and the Padres play the Series, and nearly
90% of the innings
                  show the same scoring as in the "mistake" posting.
                  Sports fans, reporters and bookies would all cry foul, right?
                  Now consider what happened this week:
                  On Monday night, ABC News accidentally posted complete state-by-state
                  election results on its Web site, hours before any votes
were cast yesterday.
                  ABC withdrew the numbers by mid-evening Monday, saying they were all a
                  mistake and a test of their systems.
                  "It wasn't our finest hour," Michelle Bergman, manager of
communications for
                  ABCNews.com, told the Associated Press yesterday.
                  And, indeed, in the days before each national election,
the major national news
                  organizations hold "rehearsals" for reporting election night, using "dummy"
                  numbers.
                  Or maybe ...
                  With almost all election districts reporting, those "phony" ABC News test
                  numbers on Monday accurately matched the outcomes of the
Senate and
                  governor races in 61 of the 70 contests ^ï¿½ 87%. It would be
difficult to find a
                  political analyst, pundit or bookie who even came close.
                  While every major analyst on Sunday was predicting the Republicans would
                  pick up anywhere from one to four Senate seats this week,
ABC's test
                  numbers on Monday had it right on the money: a 55-45 GOP-Democrat split,
                  for no net change.
                  Even more remarkable, in some of the most closely watched
contests, ABC News                   election eve "test" numbers matched the final vote count
almost precisely ^ï¿½                   within one percentage point.
                  In the Florida governor's race, Jeb Bush beat Buddy MacKay
by 55% to 45% ^ï¿½
                  the exact final result rehearsed by ABC News on Monday. In Texas, Jeb's
                  brother George won by 69% to Mauro's 30% ^ï¿½ the very result used in the ABC
                  rehearsal on Monday.
                  ABC News rehearsal numbers also matched the exact final
results, to within
                  one percentage point, of the governors' races in Alabama,
Colorado, Wisconsin
                  and Wyoming.
                  All told, ABC's "error" had the correct candidates winning
the governors
                  mansions in 32 of 36 elections yesterday. The only gubernatorial contests
                  where ABC had the wrong candidate winning were in Hawaii,
Iowa, New Mexico
                  and Minnesota, where few predicted Reform Party candidate Jesse Ventura
                  would be the new governor.
                  In the Senate elections, ABC's test numbers matched the
winners in 29 of 34
                  contests, including all of the major races. ABC on Monday
had posted "WIN"
                  indicators next to Boxer, Schumer, Fitzgerald, Murray and
Hollings, all of whom
                  won close races in California, New York, Illinois, Washington and South
                  Carolina, respectively.
                  ABC also had the correct result in Wisconsin. The final vote totals this
                  afternoon showed Russ Feingold narrowly won reelection by
38,410 votes. On
                  Monday, ABC's rehearsal numbers showed Feingold winning
reelection by a
                  margin of 39,000 votes.
                  But ABC is not claiming these numbers were the result of
any new forecasting
                  models or special analysis.
                  "It was completely random," Bergman told free! this

@_subject: Internet helps brutal governments retain control, paper says 
The subject line of this message is not supported by the paper.
The full paper, posted at says the Internet is not necessarily "an insurmountable threat to
authoritarian rule." That is different from saying the Internet "helps
brutal governments retain control."
The paper begins by noting recent scholarship that has found a positive
correlation between Net penetration and democratization -- and correctly
noting that does not imply causality, any more than the crowing of a rooster
causes the sun to rise.
But by relying on official government data on computer *ownership* and on
*registered* email accounts, the authors may have encountered a
methodological problem that has skewed data for many countries around the
world -- including the US.
Throughout Asia and Africa and especially in China (I don't have first-hand
knowledge of Cuba), relying on such data means you miss the vast majority of
the online community that uses hotmail accounts, proxy servers and
cybercafes or other non-owned machines for Net access.
For every registered user we met in China, we met several who were not
registered. So instead of the official Beijing number of 26.5 million people
on line (that's the *official* number from China Internet Network
Information Center reported today, up 56.8% from last year - details at
 most
experts we contacted said the ratio of unregistered to registered users is
4:1, yielding a total of well over 100 million.
That's still a small percentage in a country of billions, but it is
different from the paper's 17 million. Why lower than the official numbers?
The citation in a footnote takes you to  a Web site in
The page cited notes one "definition of Internet users rules out Web surfers
in Internet cafis" - which would seem to be a problem in a country full of
hotmail and yahoo email accounts. So instead they use another method to
reach these new, lower numbers: they "conducted online and written surveys
of each group to determine the proportion of Web users within each group.
The total number of Chinese Internet users was then obtained by calculating
the proportion of these groups in relation to the total Chinese population."
These are people who go to great pains *not* to be counted or found by the
government, but somehow they are expected to respond to an official survey.
And if they do not complete the survey, these people do not exist.
We also are receiving email from people in countries where, according to
this paper, all such traffic is monitored and all users are registered. Not
so. Students all seem to know how to use proxy servers and anonymizers and
avoid official scrutiny -- and are not reported by those relying on official
But more broadly, the problem is with the "one machine, one user" model of
the Internet that most in North America and Europe assume is the standard
worldwide. Not so: in Africa, Asia and South America, the standard is "one
machine, many users." One example is at
 based on our
first-hand observations and research on the ground, and there are many
others on our site.
This is not to say the Internet must inevitably topple undemocratic
governments. That is the straw man addressed in this report's introduction.
But this is to say that it is an important influence in totalitarian
countries, enabling a still small but rapidly growing minority to access
information directly from outside of their countries -- and to relay that
information and their personal views via email to others.
Otherwise, what are we to make of the reports by the BBC and the NY Times
that China has been forced to change "official" versions of news stories
because Chinese can send email to each other (and to those outside of China)
with first-hand accounts of what actually happened?
