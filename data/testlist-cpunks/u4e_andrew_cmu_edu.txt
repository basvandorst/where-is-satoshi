Well, it looks like someone at EFF finally woke up and listened to what
the crypto world was telling them!  Still not signed to protect against
forgeries, but definitely a step in the right direction!

EFF PGP Public Key for Encryption
This is the ASCII-armored PGP 2.4 public key for the Electronic Frontier
Foundation (EFF).
Note that mail sent with this key will be considered addressed to EFF in
general, not to a specific person, unless otherwise noted.  To send
personal information to someone at EFF, for whatever reason, please use
that person's own key, or arrange some other method of communication.
This key is provided principally for the sending of sensitive legal
information, and the transmission of credit card numbers over the net
securely when becoming a member of EFF.  It takes us time and effort to decrypt, so please don't use this key trivially.  Thank you.
To add this key to your public key ring, do:
pgp -ka pgpkey.eff pubring.pgp
If your public key ring has another name, use that instead of pubring.pgp.
For MacPGP, click on Key | Add Key, select pgpkey.eff as file to get key from,
and pubring.pgp (or whatever your pubring is) for file to add key to.
To encrypt a message, please see the PGP documentation, and remember that you
will almost certainly need to generate the result as an ASCII-armored file,
so you can email it (non-ASCII-armored PGP ciphertexts are binary, and will
get mangled if you try to email them.
