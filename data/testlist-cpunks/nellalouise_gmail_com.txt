Senator Al Franken as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Privacy Technology and the Law has sent a letter to CarrierIQ asking a number of very specific questions regarding user information and technical specifics. It will be  interesting to read their response, if there is one.
A copy of the letter is available here:
The full text of the letter:
Dear Mr. Lenhart,
I am very concerned by recent reports that your companybs  softwarebpre-installed on smartphones used by millions of Americansbis  logging and may be transmitting extraordinarily sensitive information from  consumersb phones, including:
b"           when they turn their phones on;
b"           when they turn their phones off;
b"           the phone numbers they dial;
b"           the contents of text messages they receive;
b"           the URLs of the websites they visit;
b"           the contents of their online search queriesbeven when those  searches are encrypted; and
b"           the location of the customer using the smartphonebeven when the customer has expressly denied permission for an app that is currently  running to access his or her location.
It appears that this software runs automatically every time you turn your  phone on.  It also appears that an average user would have no way to know  that this software is runningband that when that user finds out, he or she  will have no reasonable means to remove or stop it.
These revelations are especially concerning in light of Carrier IQbs public assertions that it is bnot recording keystrokes or providing tracking toolsb (November 16), b[d]oes not record your keystrokes,b and b[d]oes not inspect or report on the content of your communications, such as the content of emails and SMSsb (November 23).
I understand the need to provide usage and diagnostic information to  carriers.  I also understand that carriers can modify Carrier IQbs software. But it appears that Carrier IQbs software captures a broad swath of extremely sensitive information from users that would appear to have nothing to do with diagnosticsbincluding who they are calling, the contents of the texts they are receiving, the contents of their searches, and the websites they visit.
These actions may violate federal privacy laws, including the Electronic  Communications Privacy Act and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.  This is  potentially a very serious matter.
I ask that you provide answers to the following questions by December 14,  (1)        Does Carrier IQ software log usersb location?
(2)        What other data does Carrier IQ software log?  Does it log:
a.         The telephone numbers users dial?
b.         The telephone numbers of individuals calling a user?
c.         The contents of the text messages users receive?
d.         The contents of the text messages users send?
e.         The contents of the emails they receive?
f.          The contents of the emails users send?
g.         The URLs of the websites that users visit?
h.         The contents of usersb online search queries?
i.          The names or contact information from usersb address books?
j.          Any other keystroke data?
(3)        What if any of this data is transmitted off of a usersb phone?  When?  In what form?
(4)        Is that data transmitted to Carrier IQ?  Is it transmitted to  smartphone manufacturers, operating system providers, or carriers?  Is it  transmitted to any other third parties?
(5)        If Carrier IQ receives this data, does it subsequently share it  with third parties?  With whom does it share this data?  What data is  (6)        Will Carrier IQ allow users to stop any logging and transmission of this data?
(7)        How long does Carrier IQ store this data?
(8)        Has Carrier IQ disclosed this data to federal or state law  (9)        How does Carrier IQ protect this data against hackers and other  security threats?
(10)      Does Carrier IQ believe that its actions comply with the  Electronic  Communications Privacy Act, including the federal wiretap  statute (18 U.S.C. B' 2511 et seq.), the pen register statute (18 USC B' 3121 et seq.), and the Stored Communications Act (18 U.S.C. B' 2701 et seq.)?
(11)      Does Carrier IQ believe that its actions comply with the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (18 U.S.C. B' 1030)?  Why?
I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter.
