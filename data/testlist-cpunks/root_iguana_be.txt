Hi Tim,
Why is it that so many people on the other side of the ocean still think
they are in the Far West ?
   ^^^^
'your' land ? Oh, you mean what Columbus did ?
Otoh, you're right. The best way to solve problems is to kill the
problem-maker(s at both sides). But be sure to kill everyone, including
babies and such. And don't forget to kill everyone you suspect might one
day think (s)he is a far-far-descendant of the killed ones... Let's blow
up the earth, while we're on it ?
not! The major reason people can't live together is furnished by
politicians who feel they should make it to history books ;-(

High Paul,
I've not been long enough on this list for what ? Don't know about you,
but imvho violence is not a right solution. I will never be long enough on
this list to change my mind on that.
I must admit that it has helped quite a lot, those bombs. Expecially for
the building sector. How much must you hate someone to wish him/her dead ? Have you ever been
'contronted' with dead, Paul ? Someone of your friends, relatives, ... who
died, perhaps ? How can you wish some other human being the same ? What if the IRA would blow up the queen ? I guess Charles is the next to
step on then ? What a progress !!
Havalook at Kongo: Mobutu has gone. Much better now ! After several
thousands were killed, the new president gives his first orders: "women
should not wear tight shirts anymore (I thought they were supposed to take
them off, but...) nor should they act in a sensual way.
Right, violence is at least A solution. But for what ?
BTW, I'd be very interested if you would care telling something more about
Northern Ireland. That's where you live I guess ? Are you "Catholic" or
"Protestant" ?

High Paul,
I'm sorry, I should refrain from posting to this list again till I
understand English ;-)
I agree with civil disobediance as a matter of revolt, and of course if
you have a reason to do so. Not everything the government does is wrong,
only because it is done by the government.

Are you sure they are trying to get Explorer ? it's *very* difficult to
buy a PC nowadays that comes without it. My guess is that people are still
trying to get the vital bugfixes for NT, IE, Win95,...
BTW: if people think IE will do better, they should broaden their minds.
Long live ActiveX ! Recently, MS also implemented a file upload thingie
for IE. What else do you need to browse a visitor's PC ?

@_subject: HUMOR: Bill Gates gets it, PRESERVED for the FUTURE! 
yeah right...  First of all, Bill Gates was received overhere like a king. He talked to a bunch of ministers, the prince, and above all, he got
something that can be considered as the biggest honor one can get: a
whipped cream cake in the face. If you're considered unimportant, you
don't get one in the face at all. I think he didn't mind though: BG signed a contract with Mr Vanden Brande,
the Flemish number one minister, for the PC Kadee project: M$ will
-happily- install 40.000 (fourty thousand !!) PC's with their software on
it. The project is for K12 and up (pre-college) schools. M$ will not
donate this of course, we in Belgium are dumb enough to gladly PAY (a
so-called reduced price) for this kind of joke. So no, I'm not too happy at all about this incident. Would have been
better if he didn't get this kind of attention.                    \\\___///
