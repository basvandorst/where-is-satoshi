that every node and client is doing the work as it should, so, when asked,
it should answer with the truth of what is asked. If it is found that the
node or client is lying, it is penalized or banned, and its transactions
rejected are not included in the blockchain.
Laws are written in the source code in the form of *generics* and the
corresponding *methods*. A *method* is a specific application of a *generic*.
For example, for the *generic* of the Law of Bandwidth there are going to
be several *methods* for judging nodes, users and publishers."
A piece of advice for people looking to extend anonymity protocols having
to do with decentralized value transfer systems: consider the context in
which the author(s) created the Bitcoin protocol and question whether or
not a given objective was achieved. One possibility is that Bitcoin was an
attempt to rectify the dependence upon physical commodities in digital
bearer share systems such as eCache. In that sense it was successful.
However, it may have failed in that running a digital bearer share system
with reserves in Bitcoin is problematic for a number of reasons.
Try taking a crack at building a digital bearer share system in which
Bitcoin is the reserve currency and there is a mapping of digital bearer
shares to reserves in a manner such that the bank can not defraud clients
by misreporting the reserves issued at any point in time.
If you build a system where two separate banks can operate with reserves in
Bitcoin and the client can audit the number of reserves issued without
implicit trust in the bank you'll have something very impressive. You may
find it is difficult to solve this lack of trust in token issuers without
recursively embedding a Bitcoin model at the bank level (w.r.t shares
Such a system would provide low latency transactions, allow for fully
anonymous banks, and provide financial transactions for clients with a
higher degree of privacy enhancement than that currently offered by
Bitcoin. Users of two separate banks could exchange currencies directly
without ever touching the block chain. It simplifies the evasion of coin
traceability and there could be both public and highly private collections
of banks (where all you see is one [or more] bitcoin addresses [e.g., no
real indication of their existence without prior awareness /
