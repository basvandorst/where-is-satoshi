I mailed this about 5 minutes before the news of list death arrived, so
it didn't make it. Conspiracy! Anyway, I posted this to comp.org.eff.talk
and so far it has generated no interest.
The Cypherpunks have been mentioned in various articles in the mass media
as a group that would at least toy with the idea of civil disobedience
concerning ITAR violation. Imagine yourselves trying to topple ITAR
by publically exporting PGP to many countries, every day, for over a
year. Yet do any of us really want to push our luck this way? Phil
Zimmermann is out a lot of cash paying for a legal team. He can hardly
afford taking his family out for dinner.
That's why discovering this, I feel it should make *news*. As it turns
out, the internet's largest Macintosh ftp archive has been exporting
MacPGP2.2 every day for the last year! This to Singapore and China and
God knows where else. Every country on Earth with an internet connection,
Here is a satirical essay, explaining what anyone who takes ITAR at
face value might do if they discovered this situation....
