Yep.  When we shoot at people we think are terrorists and they turn out
to be an innocent Iraqis, we're acting maliciously and we want to turn
Iraq in to an American empire.  When radial islamists attack us and hit
U.S. citizens many of whose only connection to the government is voting
biennially, it's collateral damage.
