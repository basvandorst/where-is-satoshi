@_subject: Comic relief from patents 
Lots of patents are so absurd they would be funny, if they weren't so
dangerous.  Being sued for patent infringement isn't funny.
If you think there may be a problem with the system of software
patents, I hope you will read the League for Programming Freedom
position papers.  You can find them on ftp.uu.net in /doc/lpf.  The
principal position papers are look-and-feel.text and patents.text.
If you decide you agree with the LPF position, please join.  Joining
is easy and doesn't take much of your time.  You can find a membership
form in the file lpf.join.
