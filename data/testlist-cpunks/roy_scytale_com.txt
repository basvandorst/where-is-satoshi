References: I can verify that.  My copy of "O Brother, Where Art Thou" has 2 trailers that play _before the main menu_.  Fortunately, chapter skip goes right by them, but it's still annoying.  I've got one or two others with intrusive trailers, but their titles escape me.
As I understand it, DVDs are controlled by a (reputedly powerful) script language that allows disabling arbitrary features of the player.  (the FBI warning usually won't skip)
I can always tell my player to go directly to a title/chapter.  Unskippable trailers will probably just lead to my keeping a Sharpie near the player so I can make a note on the new discs as to where I want to start.  Is that "circumvention"?
Hmmm...  The DMCA prohibits Sharpie markers?

I got into an interesting conversation today.  Here's the question:  if a vendor rolls out a net-enabled product that features a crypto-
secured interface, what kind of liability do they face if the interface security is breached?  In particular, we were discussing machine controls and the recent incident where it was discovered that one manufacturer was fielding a GPIB control card with TCP/IP Ethernet and no security at all. If a net-connected and secured machine were hacked and death or personal injury resulted, does that make the manufacturer an accessory to manslaughter?  Would having a provably good (or provably bad) security layer mitigate this?

OK, I can buy that.  But would it be wild speculation to predict that the online identity eventually gets tied to the Windows user login?  This still doesn't prevent nymity (barring biometric logon and prevention of multiple accounts using the same biotoken, but I don't want to go too far afield), but it makes it less convenient.  By the time J. Random Luser realizes he wants (needs?) to nymify, the barriers to entry are in place. The third 'E'.

I agree, but both of us are possessed of some clue.  It can be argued that nymity also benefits the non-techie, but this is the same audience that doesn't use PGP because it's too complicated (notwithstanding the Eudora and Outlook plugins).  For the Linophobes, Windows is the only apparent choice.

My US passport does have a magstrip.  It's embedded in the front cover, and must be read by a special device.  I've seen it scanned only once, when leaving Montreal to return home.  (point being, a driver's licence reader can't read passport magstrips)
At least one club in Minneapolis has a prominent sign stating they will not accept a US passport as ID unless it's accompanied by a "yellow slip", that being the document indicating that the person has applied for a state-issued ID card.  I've never taken the time to ask the reasoning behind this policy.
It's probably reasonable to assume the formats differ.  I haven't yet had the time to build up a magstripe reader and check mine, but Minnesota also puts a high-density barcode on the front of the license.  I have read that out, and it's name, address, DOB, licence class, a couple of fields I can't figure out and a final field that says "20 EXTRA BYTES HERE".  (yes, really)

Believe it or not, I still have one mail route that travels over UUCP for the last link.  For the past 4 or 5 years, I've done UUCP over TCP/IP.  I'd think that one could tunnel that through SSL, though I've never tried to do it.
Heh... 19,200 was blazingly fast in those days, and the Telebit was set up for UUCP spoofing (the local modem faked the ACK packets to save turnaround time) to get better throughput.  Still, I think a 56K modem could outpull a Telebit.

I was wondering in a similar vein.

NewsMax carries a story  that 5 suspects have been identified.
This is too easy.
The overt sophistication of this attack was such that I have a hard time believing the perps would leave so many obvious clues behind without intending to.  And if they intended to leave clues, the clues are almost certainly red herrings.

This may have been discussed before, but a Google search has turned up lacking.
Given internet access from a private intranet, through an HTTP proxy out of the user's control, is it possible to establish a secure tunnel to an outside server?  I'd expect that ordinary SSL connections will secure user <-> proxy and proxy <-> server separately, with the proxy able to observe cleartext.  Could an SSH connection be made under these conditions?
Pointers appreciated, thanks.
