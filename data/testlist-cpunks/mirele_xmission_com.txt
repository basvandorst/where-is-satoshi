@_subject: Scientology harassing anon.penet.fi again! 
forwarded from rnewman at cybercom.net (Ron Newman):
Here's what Grady said to me in several messages.  Note that
they seem to be after anon.penet.fi again too.
(He has given me blanket permission to distribute his e-mail to me to
 anyone who may find it of use.)
I've just received e-mail from:
kaj.malmberg at mallu.pp.fi (Kaj Malmberg)
The Poilice CID in Helsinki who is being pushed by the criminal cult yet
again to get a search warrant for Julf's anonymous remailer, claiming I
have been violating my injunction to post cult crap.
I told him that as usual the criminal cult is lying and that I gave him
and Julf explicit permission to investigate any or all of my posts I have
ever made through the remailer.
The criminal cult is trying to use the fact of my injunction to further
their own conspiracy theories.  South Africa, Finland, where does it end?
I like to err on the side of openness. Each to their own I suppose.
Basically I trust Kaj to sense who is the criminal perpetrator in this
case. I also sent him the set of trial stipulations in the Snow White case
that ought to give him very interesting background on the criminal cult.
He is still free to do as he wishes.
No one was with me.
Total hours day one: 7.5
Total hours day two: 3.25 hours, as per order of Judge Infante. Also I
believe all american anonymous remailers will be subpoenaed for their
records as will all my ISPs, and contents of safety deposit box held as
I don't know what's up today, but Julf wrote yesterday
to tell me that my id grady at northcoast.com had NOT
been used to go through his remailer.
No word on what the police are doing to subpoena his system,
if they are.
That is all he told me: that he could verify to authorities
that grady at northcoast.com had not used his remailer.
He didn;t mention anyone else or how he was helping the CID
with their inquiries.  Yes, you can put this datum on the web.

Due to the fact that I have been threatened by the Church of Scientology
with legal action if I do not cease and desist posting encheferated
parodies of their secret scripture (per a letter I received from Cult
attorneys via Federal Express today) I am in search of OS/2 disk

@_subject: OS/2 encryption 
I have received a lot of comment about my request for OS/2
encryption...perhaps I didn't make myself clear.
I have already taken precautions (have been, for over a year) to protect
my private documents and email via use of PGP.  I simply wanted to improve
the security of my home system overall.  I have been alarmed to see how,
in the Wollersheim and Penney court cases, the Church of Scientology was
able to sue people, take custody of their computers, and basically trash
their hard drives.  Frankly, I've worked too damned hard on getting my
system just right to have some bozo blunder in and erase things, either
through stupidity, cupidity, or maliciousness.
*That's* why I inquired about disk security.  Not because I'm trying to
hide something from Scientology...but because I don't appreciate people
messing around with something that I've worked very hard on.

Well, anything to slow them down.  It was reported to me that when Dennis
Erlich was raided last year, they rendered his computer unbootable because
of the deletions they had made.  As it is, I haven't been able to find an
appropriate security utility beyond PGP (which I've been using for over a
year anyway).  So this discussion is moot.
Look folks.  *This* is what it's about.  I like a little humour.  So what
I've been doing is taking *posted* documents and running them through a
filter (the "encheferizer" of alt.swedish.chef.bork.bork.bork) and then
reposting them to alt.religion.scientology.  I have been doing this for
over a year.  It's only been recently that (a) the Church  started
cancelling them and (b) that they started threatening me over it.  And then the humourless gits of the Church  went to the trouble to
get an attorney in New York City to threaten me.  I'm taking the threat
very seriously.  This (looking for more secure ways to keep my computer
from being trashed) is part of it.  (If people would like to read the letter I received from the Church
, either read alt.religion.scientology, where it has been posted, or email me and I will send you a copy.)

@_subject: Another thing the Net is being blamed for... 
Yet another thing that we're being blamed for.  FYI, the temple ceremony has been reproduced many times since it was first exposed in the 1840s.  The most recent revision (1990) was kept secret for only a short time before notorious former members got ahold of a tape and transcript of the ceremony.  (I have a good idea of how they got it.)  As far as I can tell, it didn't actually make it on to the Net until about 1994.
This particular Mormon churchman (Russell Ballard) gave a speech a year or so ago warning Mormons in vague terms about the evils of the Internet.  I suppose this is part of it.
   "During a press tour this week of the LDS [Mormon] Church's new Mount
Timpanogos Temple in American Fork, a member of the news media asked
why a writtem copy of the temple ceremony was not given to members
with temple recommends so they could study it in the privacy of their
   Elder M. Russell Ballard of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles
informed the reporter that there was no need. A church member had
'broken the covenant' -- taped the ceremony, transcribed it, and put
it on the Internet for all to read."

@_subject: penet to be compromised again? More Scientology lawsuit crap 
I just received some information on IRC channel  that Julf Helsinghuis is being sued by $cientology *yet again* for a name.
Apparently this has to do with the deposition request to Homer Wilson Smith (lightlink.com).  Scamizdat  was posted through lightlink.com and the $cientologists have wanted for a long time to figure out who did it.  (Which is why they sued Grady Ward.)  Homer, in response to the deposition request, consulted his logs, and said that the original post came from penet.fi.  So $cientology has apparently gone to the Finns again to ask that Julf be forced to give up the name.
I'm appending a copy of the IRC log, as I'm too lazy to edit it down to particulars.  It includes the name of the police officer involved (Kaj Malmberg) as well as a Finnish newsgroup and article id for the whole story.  If someone knows Finnish and can give a rough translation, it would be terribly appreciated by a lot of people.
 hi guys... do you have the latest news on Julf    Helsingius' case?
 The julf case?
* Sherilyn didn;t know there _was_ a julf case...
 ok... copyright offences are crimes under Finnish    law, not torts.  Kaj Malmberg, the Finnish police officer who handles    the investigation of the copyrighted material through    penet.fi, posted an article to a domestic newsgroup today.  Do you have the message-id and group name?
 the scienos have filed a motion at a local court in    Helsinki to force Julf Helsingius to give out the name of    the poster.  sherilyn, are you good at Finnish?
 ig: lol!
 Who posted what through penet??
 the hearing is scheduled for the beginning of next    week... perhaps already tomorrow.  So was penet the server before lightlink in the    scamizdat case?
 Homer gave them the name of the prior server, or was    going to *** skaplin changes topic to "Penet under attack...Again!"
 Well this needs to be put out loud on groups where    people use penet
 Ignatus: How good are you at translating?
 Last attack on penet got the scientologists a very    bad rep
 This cop guy speaks English
 Didn't he post in English to a.r.s.?
 It's true, skap
 i don't know more than what I already mentioned. The    police officer didn't even mention Scientology; he just    mentioned that he was investigating a copyright offence.  She would make a lovely domina
 We're sure penet is under attack for a name though...
 Bloody hell fire!
 I have 6440 posts downloading!
 i'm writing an article to post to the ng:s, but it's    obvious we don't have all the bits of the puzzle yet.  Want some kippers with your spam sheri?? :)
 Ignatus: What newsgroup was it in?
 skap, sfnet.keskustelu.laki; <4os5bu$flp at idefix.eunet.fi>  the police officer, Kaj Malmberg, is at    kaj.malmberg at helsinki.poliisi.fi Deana Holmes

attila, if you wouldn't post propaganda from the Church, then I *might* agree with you.  But you can't do that and expect those of us who know better to keep quiet.
Love your CYA statement, dude.  It's terribly doubtful that Hinckley knows the details of Mountain Meadows, or that he would want to discuss them, if he did.
Very good.  You know, of course, that if you say the wrong thing in public, that your fate will be that of D. Michael Quinn, the excommunicated Mormon historian, who lost his Church membership because he would not stop telling unpleasant truths about the Church's early history.  Just so the other c-punks know that speaking truth has consequences.
     ******************************************************************* If anyone wants a more jaundiced view of Utah, please drop me a line. I can be a Utah cheerleader if I want (there are many good things about living here) but the fact of the matter is that we live in a Church State.  I resent the fact that the dominant religion seems to want to tell *everyone* here how to live their lives.
I would suggest two books, both by historian Juanita Brooks:
"The Mountain Meadows Massacre"
"John D. Lee"
Before the days of Boyd K. Packer, historians weren't excommunicated. Mrs. Brooks' punishment for writing these two books was to be shunned in her southern Utah community.  But they remain *the* sources on Mountain Meadows and the general attitude of the people at the time.
I notice that attila didn't mention these sources.

You know you're doing good when both Dmitri Vulis and Attila both
badmouth you.  (For the record, Attila's badmouthing consisted of
stating via private email that I was "the same air head
pseudo-intellectual who has poisoned her own life with hatred and
ignorance in so many other venues.") Some people are just terribly threatened, I guess.

I suspect that Dmitri is referring to the Mountain Meadows Massacre.  It's not a pretty story and is one of the low points of Mormon The late historian Juanita Brooks wrote about the masscre, and about the leader, John D. Lee, in a couple of books.  ===end vulis rant===

@_subject: Utah as a Religious Police State 
I never cease to be surprised by Mormon apologists who refuse to look in the mirror at problems in so-called "working Mormon communities."  I moved to Utah 2 years ago from Texas.  Even though I am nominally Mormon (I haven't been to Church in years), it was still a huge culture shock to me.  I think the thing that bugs me the most is the way the political system is dominated by a 500 lb. elephant known as the LDS Church.  We Utahns sit in a room with this elephant that eats and s**ts and yet we don't talk about the fact that it's there.
This is Utah for you...Utah where during the first legislative
session I was here (1995) the legislature spent 42 out of 45 days
talking about whether they were going to have tightened ethics laws.
 Where during the last legislative session (1996) the legislature
spent 42 of 45 days discussing what to do about the fact that a few
kids in one of the Salt Lake high schools wanted to have a
gay/lesbian/straight club.  NO MATTER that the schools are horribly
overcrowded and that in some elementary grades 40-plus students per
classroom is the norm.  NO MATTER that teachers are horribly
underpaid in a state with California-style costs.  NO MATTER that
despite a $100 million surplus the governor and the legislature
can't see clear to get rid of the sales tax on *food*.  NO MATTER
that if anything terribly controversial (or even not so
controversial)  comes up, someone in the legislature feels like they
have to sound out the Church to make sure that they don't cross Gordon B. Hinckley or Boyd K. Packer and endanger their Church In the meantime, our legislators (with Church approval, these are Church "callings") run down to the prison at Point of the Mountain to "counsel" convicted child abusers and then pass laws to get rid of minimum mandatory sentencing.  The roads are falling apart here, the schools are overcrowded.  Gang violence is prevalent up and down the Wasatch Front.  I heard about a gang-related murder in Layton last weekend.  Up until a month ago, when the mayor of Salt Lake City closed the place and forced them out, there was a well-known open-air drug supermarket going on in Pioneer Park.  Legislative leaders think that they're above the Open Meetings law.  And liquor laws still are  pretty backwards.  (Gee, just last week places that sell beer actually got permission to put signs that say "BEER" instead of "BEE?" on their premises.)
Thing is, Utah is generally a wonderful place to live.  As I said, I
used to live in Texas.  It's great to live in a place where the
economy is booming and there are jobs available.  The crime rate is
pretty low for an urban community (but there are sore spots, as I
indicated above).  The scenery is downright spectacular.  And Salt
Lake City proper is a pretty cool place.  But I don't believe that Utah is immune to the problems that beset other cities.  One thing that would help is for Utah opinion-makers to admit that not everyone who lives in this "pretty, great state" is a devout Mormon and/or a Republican.  Not everyone shares the same values as the dominant religion, and they shouldn't have to.  I apologise to the cypherpunks mailing list for this rant, but not everyone in Utah agrees with the view expressed by Moroni above.
