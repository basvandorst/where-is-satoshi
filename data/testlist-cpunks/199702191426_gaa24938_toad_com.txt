I just got my news admin to add alt.cypherpunks.  Unfortunately, I can't
remember the names of the subgroups (which weren't added), and I
deleted the mailings which listed them.  If I remember correctly, they were along the lines of
alt.cypherpunks.ebonics :-) Sorry, couldn't resist!
Did I miss any?  Name-mangle?
I also have listed the following alternate list hosts
cypherpunks at algebra.com
cypherpunks at cyberpass.net
cypherpunks at ssz.com
If anyone has a more complete list of hosts, I'd be happy
for additions to the list.
