The Unabomber's Code
This is interesting. Ted Kaczynski wrote in code:
     In a small journal written in code, he documented his thoughts
about the crimes he was committing. That code was so difficult, a source
says the CIA couldn't crack it -- until someone found the key itself
among other documents, and then translated it.
Look at the photo. It was a manual, pencil-and-paper cipher. Does anyone
know the details of the algorithm?

Yes, you've advanced that notion before. That sort of penurious antipathy is
why encrypted communications as a matter of course will never catch on. Not
among the masses where it is most needed. Outside of a few specialized
transactions of the financial nature, which is not at all what cypherpunkism is
really about. Or at least, what it used to be about.

You missed by a whole continent, that's the latest salvo in a barrage
though. If the message is unassailable, attack the messenger. That
comes through loud and clear. I thought you were better than that,
RAH. I haven't trolled at all in these last couple of replies either,
perhaps you wished I had so you could dismiss these uncomfortable
truths more easily.
No. Galileo advanced a fact and might swatted him for it, that the
Earth was the center of the universe has never been a fact. There are
other "facts" that simply aren't so despite consensus to the contrary.
It sounds like you are engaging in your own rationalizations.
You haven't been paying attention, have you? A refresher: the EFF is
suing AT&T for getting into bed with the NSA and the widespread
eavesdropping that has been engaged in. Widespread encryption has been
needed for quite some time, it hasn't been particularly wanted because
it isn't easy or accessible. Yet.
Prove it. You could use a few extra million dollars, couldn't you?
Let's review. I asked why Mixmaster software was not available for the

It's my pah-ty, I can whine if I want to. BTW, how does pointing
out an issue, not qualify as fixing the problem at hand? Hmmm?
I know. The point, which you missed, was RAH sending a shortened URL.
If RAH wants to send URLs like that, he can. But he damages his own
cypherpunk street cred, with each shortened URL. Because with that
shorty URL, he makes you and me engage in labor we should not have
to engage in, if only he had sent the real (target) URL instead.
The question we need to be asking ourselves, why on earth did RAH
go to the extra effort of creating that short URL in the first
place? He's a veteran of this list, what is his angle? Or the angle
of whatever it is that has its whole arm up his ass, if he really
can't defend himself. Which he hasn't, yet. Tim May can't be blamed
for short URLs.
Do you get it now?
Even then, bit.ly or shor.ty or as.sy are not guaranteed to be
available in 1, 5, 10 years. Example? Shurl.com and yes, it did
used to exist: Can you hear me now/yet? WOULD IT HELP IF I SHOUTED?
Yes, no, and you lose. His shorty URL caused you to engage in labor
you should not have had to engage in - and you were probably exposed
to ads - or links to ads, as a result.
When will strong encryption be baked into email clients, so that
discussions like this are not necessary anymore?
And, your demimed email client sucks too.

It is only available bundled together with tv and internet service and
comes via coax, fiber optic, satellite service or some combination of
the above. Which basically means the copper that was used years ago is
now unused and growing verdigris where it hasn't been ripped out already.
Consequently, I had to do something I hadn't wanted to otherwise, get

What I'm hearing from you is, the original malfeasance of putting
publicly-funded research data the taxpaying public has already bought
and paid for behind a paywall and extorting the taxpaying public for
access to that data does not warrant extraordinary measures to
liberate that data in the manner it should have been liberated in
the first place. That there were unintended consequences of the
exact method used to liberate that data is secondary, perhaps it is
even inconsequential to the real central principle here.

Oh, so sorry. I'll be watching for you on the next poker championship
since you are so accurate and reliable at reading tells. Or, you could
refrain from attributing motives beyond those that may be safely
inferred from a fair reading of the known facts.

Is it no-longer true that one "Aw shit" cancels out 1,000 Attaboys?
Put another way, stopped clocks might tell the correct time twice a
day but that is irrelevant. The thing to know about stopped clocks
is that they are stopped.

I haven't seen anyone here dispute that he entered the physical
premises and physically connected to the network.
While you've been at it though, you've attributed motive and imposed
a revealing lexicon on a framework that does not readily support it.
Thereby casting yourself in a bad light. Some examples:
That's 3 "Aw Shit"s since the 5th and there are more hidden by the
ellipsis, you'd better can it and start earning some more Attaboys.

Secrets, lies and Snowden's email: why I was forced to shut down Lavabit
For the first time, the founder of an encrypted email startup that was supposed to insure privacy for all reveals how the FBI and the US legal system made sure we don't have the right to much privacy in the first place
By Ladar Levison
May 20 2014
My legal saga started last summer with a knock at the door, behind which stood two federal agents ready to to serve me with a court order requiring the installation of surveillance equipment on my company's network.
My company, Lavabit, provided email services to 410,000 people ­ including Edward Snowden, according to news reports ­ and thrived by offering features specifically designed to protect the privacy and security of its customers. I had no choice but to consent to the installation of their device, which would hand the US government access to all of the messages ­ to and from all of my customers ­ as they travelled between their email accounts other providers on the Internet.
But that wasn't enough. The federal agents then claimed that their court order required me to surrender my company's private encryption keys, and I balked. What they said they needed were customer passwords ­ which were sent securely ­ so that they could access the plain-text versions of messages from customers using my company's encrypted storage feature. (The government would later claim they only made this demand because of my "noncompliance".)
Bothered by what the agents were saying, I informed them that I would first need to read the order they had just delivered ­ and then consult with an attorney. The feds seemed surprised by my hesitation.
What ensued was a flurry of legal proceedings that would last 38 days, ending not only my startup but also destroying, bit by bit, the very principle upon which I founded it ­ that we all have a right to personal privacy.
In the first two weeks, I was served legal papers a total of seven times and was in contact with the FBI every other day. (This was the period a prosecutor would later characterize as my "period of silence".) It took a week for me to identify an attorney who could adequately represent me, given the complex technological and legal issues involved ­ and we were in contact for less than a day when agents served me with a summons ordering me to appear in a Virginia courtroom, over 1,000 miles from my home. Two days later, I was served the first subpoena for the encryption keys.
With such short notice, my first attorney was unable to appear alongside me in court. Because the whole case was under seal, I couldn't even admit to anyone who wasn't an attorney that I needed a lawyer, let alone why. In the days before my appearance, I would spend hours repeating the facts of the case to a dozen attorneys, as I sought someone else that was qualified to represent me. I also discovered that as a third party in a federal criminal indictment, I had no right to counsel. After all, only my property was in jeopardy ­ not my liberty. Finally, I was forced to choose between appearing alone or facing a bench warrant for my arrest.
In Virginia, the government replaced its encryption key subpoena with a search warrant and a new court date. I retained a small, local law firm before I went back to my home state, which was then forced to assemble a legal strategy and file briefs in just a few short days. The court barred them from consulting outside experts about either the statutes or the technology involved in the case. The court didn't even deliver transcripts of my first appearance to my own lawyers for two months, and forced them to proceed without access to the information they needed.
Then, a federal judge entered an order of contempt against me ­ without even so much as a hearing.

Do you run a WiFi network? What is the nature of your business, is it
financial? Those could be repackaged Pineapple devices, who knows.
What about the person? Age? Fit? Could it have been an undercover LEO?
Someone doing pentesting seems likely to me.

Fuck that.
Now, did I say something exploitative or degrading about sex/love
or was it merely a coarse rejection of a notional assertion?
Word meanings change over time. To not acknowledge and take this
into consideration reveals an agenda.
Watch while I now make some vacuous claim about something else:

That seems pointless, BTDT a few times and had the same said to me
more times than that. What followed after was, a pleasure.
A religious agenda, most probably. Mainstream religions these days
have odd ideas about women and the sex act. They should advance their
theologies because it's the 21st century now, not the Dark Ages (which
xtianity single-handedly caused (for western civilization), btw).

Various extensions have been known to "fix" or "restore" various things that Firefox should do or used to do, although I cannot address the purity of the manner by which they do so.
I wonder, is there an A-list of must-have extensions for Firefox? Because "the internet is for porn," and porn doesn't work on text-only browsers...
How about a blacklist of extensions to avoid at all costs?
