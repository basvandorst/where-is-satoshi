Fat chance.
Still, this brings up an interesting point:  Considering the special
abilities of many of the principals here, is there something especially
tasty in store for those net predators who spam this list?
I've always imagined something _very_ special happens to their accounts,
but I may just be a hopeless romantic, I dunno...
If not, why not?

I disagree. Only some ways, you don't see them tossing their AK 47s for spears.
Wrong, and wrong. Lending to individuals is happening, in $100 or so ammounts, without westerners (or their governments' crooked bureaucrats) present, right now.

I export cryptography source code almost every single day.
  Does the government have a problem with that? Fuck them in

  I can't believe that corporations pay legal experts huge

  I am not alone. My nephew regularly exports 'code' for
Pig-Latin, as a parody of my efforts to spread the use
of crypto. He says that they can take his Pig-Latin when
they pry it from his cold, dead, baby fingers.
  Cable companies regularly export encryption code when
they send out their signal-scrambling code to foreign
  Can you think of other examples? Can you think of hundreds of similar examples? Think about it.
  If the government wants to prosecute me for exporting
encryption code, then they had best be prepared to prosecute _all_ exporters of every single item that
involves altering data that can be re-converted on the other end to render the output intelligible.
  If you think that I am taking this matter lightly,
then think again, because I have a legal opinion from an attorney who has been shoving the governments
dick back in their own face for half a century, and
he regards my potential defence as a cake-walk.
  I not only already have the paperwork set up to defy any potential restraining orders that may arise, but I have a judge that is fully prepared
to institute the necessary proceedings to validate
my right to do what hundreds or thousands of individuals and corporations are doing every single
  If the government thinks that they can legislate

they had best think again. And if they think that they can require exported condoms to have holes in

Without answering any of the points raised by Wei Dai, let
me address the subject line.
I have been a long time reader of and occasional contributor to
the cypherpunks list. Since it is high volume, I prefer not to have
it show up in my mailbox, but read it from either nntp.hks.net or
infinity.nus.sg/cypherpunks. With the recent change in status of the
list, what I get at those two places is the edited list. The same
would apply to other sublists subscribed to cypherpunks at toad.com too.
If hks and infinity started archiving the unedited list, this wouldn't
bother me so much.
Other than that, I am saddened, as much as a Tim is enraged, that
a supposedly libertarian and anarchistic group of people has decided
that censorship is the right solution to their problems.
Btw, what is with nntp.hks.net? Seems to have been down for couple

@_subject: EuroGAK 
An EU insider writes (paraphrased):
As you say, an EU policy on cryptography requires the utmost care.
We have been following US initiatives closely.  The USG's latest proposal
attempts to balance the need for security with the need to tackle crime.
Some EU Member States have begun work possibly leading to Government
access to keys (where legally authorised).  Various conventions and laws
set out rights for the citizen and these will be respected.
It is not suggested that access should include signature keys, only
those for message confidentiality (as with police search powers).
The term "Government access to keys" is used.
No mention of mandatory GAK, or the (in)effectiveness of GAK against crime.
He refers to "message  confidentiality ... police search powers"
by which he perhaps means wiretap, rather than search.  Or perhaps he means
storage as well as messages.
His "signature keys" does not specify the plan for a dual-purpose key,
but my guess is they would wish to obtain a dual-purpose key if interested in its cyphertext.

@_subject: High-tech tracking by police raises legal outcry 
Police across the country secretly tail hundres of people each year by attaching high-tech
transmitters to suspects' cars and tracking them on squadroom computer screens.
Detectives, federal agents and prosecutors routinely conceal use of the technology from
defendants, their lawyers and the public, an investigation by The Orange County Register
has found. Autorities in Orange County often plant the devices on cars without getting
a warrant from a judge.
The technology, marketed by a company called Teletrac, is simple: A tramsmitter sends a
radio signal to a computer, which pinpoints the car's street location. Police with the proper software can follow a transimitter-equipped vehicle in real time as it moves across a
street map on a computer screen.
"Is there any expectation of privacy on the whereabouts of a car on a public street? I
suggest there isn't," said [Jeffrey] Ferguson, president of the county's narcotics officer's
association. "I've told them they don't need a warrant unless they intend to enter a car."
The system automatically records the time, date, location and duration of the car's stops.
The system could tell police, for example, that the suspect's car stopped on Main Street
between 4th and 5th streest for about an hour on Jan. 5. The records help police focus
their investigation on places the suspects visits.
Obviously, several list members were wrong. Travel GAK is not coming; It is already here.

Dear Cypher Punks,
I BEG YOU TO HELP ME!!!
Is it possible to prove that number 0.1234567891011121314151617181920...
iz irrational? Or may be it is rational?
Also, another question for math geniuses here: Is it REALLY true that there are real numbers that cannot be generated
by any algorithm? Some guy said that since the set of algorithms is
countable, but the set of real numbers is more than countable, there must be some numbers for which there is no algorithms that generate them.
But I still do not believe him.
Also, is it true that the sequence of digits in e is random because the ONLY way to get to the
p'th digit is to calculate the p-1'st digits?
Also, is it the correct definition of a real number: ``A real number is the class of numbers which can represent the length of
an arbitrary line.''

Not a problem Dr. Vulis, whenever I purchase items from Radio Shack,
I use your name and address and phone number.  I hope you don't mind
receiving extra catalogues.   It is after all, all in the good name of privacy and protecting my uncoloured identity.
