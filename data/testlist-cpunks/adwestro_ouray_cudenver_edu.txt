On Fri, 21 Jul 95 8:46:26 -0600,
Your points are well taken, but I'm still in favor of concentrating
on the Exon bill until such time as SB 974 shows any signs of support
from other politicians.  Both bills are preposterous, of course:
unconstitutional and unenforceable.  There's one particularly absurd
aspect to SB 974 that I haven't seen mentioned on the Cypherpunks
list, possibly because it goes without saying.  I'll say it anyway,
first quoting the relevant portion of the bill:
`Sec. 1030A. Racketeering-related crimes involving computers
 `(a) It shall be unlawful    [...(1) snipped -- ADW]
 `(2) to distribute computer software that encodes or encrypts
      electronic or digital communications to computer networks that
      the person distributing the software knows or reasonably should
      know, is accessible to foreign nationals [...]
One area where the U.S. has retained strong international competitiveness
is its colleges and universities.  The number of these institutions that
have no foreign nationals enrolled is *damn* small, and largely comprises
"Ace's Truck Driving College" and the like.  Foreign nationals who are in
this country to attend college are exempt from the usual I-9 employment
restrictions; hence, many are also employed at full-time summer jobs,
internships (in government or the private sector), teaching assistantships,
or work-study positions, which may involve access to computer networks.
(Many foreign nationals complete medical residencies in U.S. hospitals,
for example.)
Preventing these people from having access to crypto software is simply
impossible.  This bill would make criminals out of thousands of network
administrators and MIS types, simply for having crypt() or Norton Diskreet
around.  If the bill gains any momentum whatsoever, I expect howls of
protest from the academic world.  I'm not sure a megabuck lobbying effort
by private industry will be necessary:  letters from Computing Services
honchos at some prestigious schools/hospitals/corporations should induce
even the most technically clueless congressdroids to pull their heads out
of their asses on this issue...(OK, maybe not Jamf-^H^Hes Exon, but enough
of 'em to prevent the bill's passage.)
Anyway, I'm glad nobody's suggested a Cypherpunk SB 974 infomercial,
financed "by each according to his ability to pay," as happened during
the Clipper debate...maybe the list *is* evolving...:-)
OK, back to your regularly scheduled Trans- and Cross-Continental Realtime

[replying to M. Froomkin about statute of limitations for prz]
Perry's response and Brian Davis' remarks about prosecutorial "creativity"
prompted me to ask Phil Dubois for clarification.  (I told him I would
probably pass his reply along to the list, so I'm not violating email
confidentiality here.)  Here's the relevant snippet:
I believe that the statute expires in June of '96, because there is a
five-year statute on the export-violation allegation and because PGP was
released in June of '91, and whoever exported it did so shortly after the
release.  It is true, however, that prosecutors have been very creative in
extending the statute when they've felt the need to do so.  We can only
hope that DOJ will not feel the need in this case.
I also feel Phil will be largely off the hook by June.  It would be
damn silly to prolong the matter, especially since the complete source
code has been published internationally in OCR format now.  Also, I
expect the Feds would rather focus their "creative" energies on the
Bernstein/EFF export issue.
But who knows what anti-crime hysteria might be whipped up in an
election year, or who it might become handy to demonize, etc.

@_subject: Entropy VI: "Shannon's Choice" (with apologies to Wm. Styron) 
I'm always glad to see stuff here about entropy:  it's a topic that
comes up in PGP 101 when locals ask, "How long should my passphrase be?"
and, as we've seen recently, failure to generate adequate entropy for
pseudo-random numbers is often the Achilles' Heel of otherwise solid
I found some info about Shannon's choice of the word "entropy" in an
unexpected source lately.  I had some free time this week due to the
surprise snowstorm here, and used it to type in a few paragraphs.
This is intended less for immediate discussion than for the list's
archives, so that I can point folks to it in the future.  And I'm
not going to cite the source, to avoid copyright infringement
nastygrams...if you know who the author is, keep it to yourself:
you'll only suffer public ridicule and loss of "reputation capital"
for Not Watching Enough TV!!! :-)
N.B. -- some of this impresses me as pompous bullshit, and I'm not in
agreement with it.  But the story about von Neumann made it a worthwhile
read, as least to me.
I want now to turn to another juncture in the cascading bifurcations
that mark interpretations of Maxwell's Demon.  The juncture occurs when
Leon Brillouin and Claude Shannon diverge in their opinions about what
the relationship between information and entropy should be.  In Brillouin's
analysis of Maxwell's Demon, the Demon's information allowed him to sort
molecules, thus decreasing the system's entropy; but this information had
to be paid for by an even greater increase in entropy elsewhere in the
system.  For Brillouin, then, information and entropy are opposites and
should have opposite signs.  He emphasized the inverse connection
between information and entropy by coining "negentropy" (from negative
entropy) as a synonym for information.
To Shannon, an engineer at Bell Laboratories who published a two-part
paper that was to form the basis of modern information theory (1948),
information and entropy were not opposites.  They were identical.  When
Shannon devised a probability function that he identified with information,
he chose to call the quantity calculated by the function the "entropy"
of the message.  Why he made this choice is unclear.  Rumor has it that
von Neumann told Shannon to use the word because "no one knows what entropy
is, so in a debate you will always have the advantage."  One could argue
that von Neumann's comment was only one element and that the choice of
"entropy" was overdetermined, with multiple factors leading to its
conflation with "information."  On a conceptual level, an important
consideration was the similarity between Shannon's equation for infor-
mation and Boltzmann's equation for entropy.  Because the two equations
had similar forms, it was tempting to regard the entities they defined
as the same.  On the level of language, entropy was compelling because
it was a term of recognized legitimacy to the concept of information.
On a cultural level, Shannon's choice anticipated the contemporary
insight that proliferating information is associated with the
production of entropy. [...]
Whatever the reasons for Shannon's choice, it is regarded by many
commentators within our scientific tradition as a scandal, for it
led to the (metaphoric) knotting together of concepts that are partly
similar and partly dissimilar.  Typical is K. G. and J. S. Denbigh's
reaction in their careful study of the way the quantity defined by
Shannon's equation differs from thermodynamic entropy.  Recounting the
story about von Neumann's advice, they write that thus, "confusion
entered in and von Neumann had done science a disservice!"  Jeffrey S.
Wicken is even more explicit, calling Shannon's choice "loose language"
that served "the dark god of obfuscation."  "As a result of its
independent lines of development in thermodynamics and information
theory, there are in science today two 'entropies,'" Wicken writes.
"This is one too many.  It is not science's habit to affix the same
name to different concepts.  Shared names suggest shared meanings, and
the connotative field of the old tends inevitably to intrude on the
denotative terrain of the new."
Clearly Wicken's concern is to restore scientific univocality by closing
off the ability of the information-entropy connection to act as a
metaphor rather than a congruence.  Yet at the same time he admits that
shared language creates an inevitable "intrusion" into the "denotative
terrain" of one term by the "connotative field" of another.  The problem
is more scandalous than he recognizes, for whenever a heuristic is
proposed, it necessarily uses "shared names" that cause scientific
denotation to be interpenetrated by cultural connotations.  For what
else is language but "shared names"?  As Wittgenstein has observed,
there are no private languages.  Moreover, the distinction between
denotative and connotative language is itself part of the distinction
between language-as-vehicle and language-as-concept which metaphors,
and particularly self-reflexive metaphors, bring into question.  To
turn Wicken's argument on its head, we might say he recognizes that
metaphors in general, and the information-entropy connection in
particular, directly threaten science's ability to separate ideas from
the language it uses to express them.
In his anxiety to suppress the metaphoric potential of Shannon's choice,
Wicken misses the richly complex and suggestive connections that were
instrumental in enabling a new view of chaos to emerge.  By the simple
device of using "information" and "entropy" as if they were interchan-
geable terms, Shannon's choice gave rise to decades of interpretative
commentary that sought to explain why information should be identified
with disorder rather than order.  For the alliance between entropy and
information to be effective, information first had to be divorced from
meaning (a premise made explicit in Shannon's 1948 papers) and had to
be associated instead with novelty.  Recall the random number generator,
mentioned earlier, that produces a tape we can read.  No matter how long
we watch the tape, numbers keep appearing in unpredictable sequence.
maximum information.
Once randomness was understood as maximum information, it was possible
to envision chaos (as Robert Shaw does) as the source of all that is
new in the world.  Wicken is correct in noting that denotative and
connotative fields overlap; in the case of information, the connotation
that "intruded" upon the denotative field of chaos was complexity.
Whereas chaos had traditionally meant simply disorder, complexity
implied a mingling of symmetry with asymmetry, predictable periodicity
with unpredictable variation.  As we have seen, chaotic or complex
systems are disordered in the sense that they are unpredictable, but
they are ordered in the sense that they possess recursive symmetries
that almost, but not quite, replicate themselves over time.  The
metaphoric joining of entropy and information was instrumental in
bringing about these developments, for it allowed complexity to be
seen as rich in information rather than deficient in order.
