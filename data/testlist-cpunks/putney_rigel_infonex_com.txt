Yup - You've got it right.  A bank's responsibility is to make the SSN match on tape with what the IRS has - thats it.  It was part of the big stink in the 80's when congress first said that all banks had to withhold on all interest, the banks yelled, and then the SSN match program was There are significant fines for banks that do not follow up on mis-matches, or do not begin "back-up" withholding.  One person is no big deal, but they add up fast!
The IRS's job is to collect income so if the number matches with a filing then a-okay!
