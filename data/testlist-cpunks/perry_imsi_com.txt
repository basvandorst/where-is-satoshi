smb at research.att.com says:
"Owners" is not strictly speaking the case -- they are a partner in
PKP. Since the PKP partnership agreement is secret (or at least I am
told it is secret), it is impossible to determine precisely what the
rules of the partnership are, but I had assumed that free cross
licensing had been part of it. I believe that Cylink has used RSA as
part of various security products in the past, so they appear to have
*HAD* a license. If Bruce has access to the exact language in the
suit, it would be of interest to hear what it says.  (Since the court
papers are all public domain, perhaps a person with a scanner might
want to put them on line...)

of thousands a year.
1) What makes you think the VAT will be small? Assuming that you have
   to pay for a government the size of the current one, only using
   VATs, you are going to have to take about half the cost of all
   goods and services in accumulated VAT by the time the goods hit the
   consumer. (This is for the obvious reason that the government
   spends half the GDP in the US.)
2) What makes you think it will be inconvenient? I know of two pizza
   places in Manhattan where they very likely don't pay taxes and
   where you can also buy drugs. (No, I'm not going to tell you where
   they are, and no, I don't buy drugs from them. I don't go telling
   the police such things, however.)
The underground economy in the U.S. is huge -- enormous, in fact. Most
of us interact with it every day without even realizing it. As a small
example, the clothing manufacture industry in New York survives on
illegal factories running almost entirely underground. Ever tip a
waiter in cash? Ever pay for a haircut in cash? Ever make a purchase
from a Mom & Pop grocery in cash?
There are tens of millions of people completely evading taxes now, and
the percentage of the population who underreport or patronize services
that underreport aproaches 100%.

Thats not a valid analogy. There are tens of millions of people in the
underground economy right now -- in a society already highly dependant
on electronic transactions. There is no economic incentive for most
people to encrypt their talk sessions -- but there is a great economic
incentive to evade taxes.
And if my grandmother had wheels she'd be a bicycle. It isn't

Adam Shostack says:
I'm the person assigned to edit/write the drafts for IPSP, which is to

protocol is to be IPng, the politically correct name for IPng is
The basic technique of packet encapsulation for security, which is the
basis for SP3, NLSP and swIPe, is being adopted, although the packet
format is being radically simplified even from that of swIPe,
consisting mainly of an SAID (what swIPe calls a "Policy Identifier).
Authentication and opaque cryptographic encapsulation formats are to
be slightly different for technical reasons.
The IPSP definition is (nearly) nailed down. The hard part, key
management, which is the layer that goes on top of IPSP, is still
being intensively discussed. I expect there will be extensive battles
there still to come, particularly on the naming of authenticated
entities -- to tell you how shaky things are there, no real proposals
are yet in draft RFC form. The one thing there is widespread agreement
on is that the DNS should be used to store keys, although this will
likely require extension of the maximum size currently permitted for
RRs in the DNS (512 bytes as defined right now.)
It is my hope that a unified IKMP (internet key management protocol)
and IPSP will provide sufficient functionality that no other security
mechanisms will be required for authenticating and securing remote
connections on the internet, and any telnet, ftp, finger, or anything
else that anyone does can be transparently made secure simply by
setting administrative requirements on the authentication and
encryption level needed by connections. Security of store-and-forward
traffic, like electronic mail and routing information, will still
require seperate mechanisms -- I hope the basic keys for those
mechanisms will be stored in the same way with the same naming, for
instance, and that most of the mechanisms will be shared.
It is also my hope that all trust mechanisms will be based on
web-of-trust rather than certification heirarchies, although that is
another speculation.

Schneier has a good discussion of this. Suffice it to say, if I have a
magic collision search box, I might very well be able to produce an
interesting result very easily.
Imagine the existance or nonexistance of a space at some number of
locations in a document as being a bit. Then, imagine that I have a
hash signed by you. If I can search very fast, I could compose a
contract that you never signed, and search through the trivial
variations of that contract with spaces present or absent at some
number of points. I can thus trivially generate the number of
variations on the contract needed to find a collision -- if I can only
search those variations fast enough you lose.
Given that ten million dollars isn't real money, if this is true MD5

Actually, as public choice economic theory has shown, bad government
tends to be the inevitable result of the evolutionary pressures on
government and government officials. This is not to say that some
government programs are not occassionally well run or that some
government officials are not legitimately "trying their best", but
that the pressure on the whole system is to go towards maximum
corruption, just as the evolutionary pressure on organisms is to only
follow survival-prone strategies.
As just one simple example, take subsidies. If you have a chance of
getting a $1,000,000 subisidy for your company, you can afford,
economically speaking, to spend up to $999,999 on lobbying to get it
and still have a profit on your hands. If, on the other hand, you are
Joe Taxpayer in a nation of 250,000,000 people, you are losing only
$.004 because of the subsidy -- it is not even economically worth your

For this and a myriad of similar causes, the evolutionary pressure on
governments is always towards evolution in an unsound direction. This
is not because anyone involved is evil but for the same sorts of
reasons that only organisms with healthy drives to reproduce are found
on the planet.

I would partially agree. We do have some actual real world experience
with one key management and authentication system -- Kerberos. Its not
sufficient, but it does provide a lot of interesting lessons. In
particular, it has a distinct advantage over most the the currently
proposed key management systems in the IETF: it is actually possible
to write secure applications with Kerberos. (This is not as bad as it
sounds; there are still ways to use the proposed key management
systems (for setting up encrypted tunnels as an example) but these
uses are more limited.)
Actually, swIPe the implementation has been ported to three systems
(largely berkeley clones) and is being actively sold as part of the
TIS firewall product. However, its future with its current packet
format is obviously limited. swIPe the packet format is quite dead,
but swIPe the implementation will probably be hacked to support the

"Kipp E.B. Hickman" says:
You are right that an encrypted IPSP packet can't be "peeked into" and
thus can't be selectively blocked by a filtering router. There is,
however, a notion in the IPv6 version (will be in the v4 version if I
have anything to do with it) of a "transparent authentication header"
which allows you to achieve authentication without privacy for those
situations that require the ability to filter packets at a firewall.
Overall, however, IPSP reduces (but does NOT by any means eliminate)
the need for firewalls, because IPSP packets can be fully private and
authenticated and thus can't be hijacked.

Being an old fogey, I still refer to the field formed by the integers

In Z_p, you define division as the inverse of multiplcation, just as
in real life. One easy way to do this is to note that every number in
a field like this has a multiplicative inverse. Multiplying by the
multiplicative inverse of a number is the same as dividing by the
number. For the hell of it, make yourself a multiplication table for Z_5. Its
a quick exercise. Note that every number in Z_5 other than zero
possesses a multiplicative inverse -- that is, a number that it can be
multiplied against to yield 1. Step back and then observe,
experimentally, that for any three positive numbers in Z_5 A, B and C
such that A*B=C, that C*(B^-1)=A. One can, of course, prove that this
is the case rigorously...

Because you've got a shitty MIME reader, you've concluded that the

The point, Tim, is that you keep conflating a bad MIME read that you

else. Your mail reader is whats doing that. If you were, say, using
the Andrew Messaging System which now understands MIME, you could

Timothy C. May says:
You misunderstand the purpose of MIME. It is a way of standardizing
the encapsulation of non-ascii information and references inside of an
RFC-822 mail message. It allows you to do things like get cyrillic or
what have you, but more importantly, it allows things like recursive
encapsulation of your messages inside encrypting transformations, the
transmission of attachments allong with documents, mailing HTML,
embedding external references in mail (i.e. "Click here to get a copy
of my latest program) and dozens of other significant things. MIME and
HTML are complementary to each other -- HTTP is one way of
transporting HTML, but with MIME you can see a Web page, cut it out,
paste it into your MIME aware gee-whiz mailer, and send it to someone
who could then treat it just like he was looking at the Web, provided
he, too, had a good enough MIME capable reader. You could send out
your latest document, in parallel, in postscript and in Word format
(or whatever) so that lots of people could read it and prepend an
explanatory document describing what the contents were -- some MIME
readers will then display the attachment as an icon that you could
then drag and drop into an appropriate viewer or printer.
MIME is a general infrastructural mechanism for this and more. Its a
bit of a toy right now on mailing lists because too many people lack
MIME capable readers, but in environments where MIME is universally
used it has already taken over and is a fundamental part of the way
people do business. Once you've seen a secretary who barely
understands anything drag a spreadsheet into a mail message and send
it to someone on another continent who, equally ignorantly, just
double-clicks on it and then has the spreadsheet program launch, you
will understand what the point of MIME is.
Without a MIME capable reader you can't do any of these things, of
course. Even with one, you might not initially see any benefits
because you might be using a mediocre reader or you might not have any
correspondants who do snazzy things. However, MIME is rapidly being
deployed and is going to be universal within a couple of years. Its
not just a silly way to sign your name with a GIF.
We are in a mostly graphical net environment. Its been seven years
since I used a machine (for more than a few minutes) that didn't have
a bitmapped display. The Macintosh you are sitting in front of right
now knows nothing about ASCII -- its a bitmapped display, not a
character generator based display, and it can show whatever font you
What you are actually saying is that you use a primitive interface
into your network service provider rather than, say, SLIP or PPP, and
that because of this you are restricted to dumb-terminal type
operations on a computer that is far more capable than that.
Were I you, I'd get PPP account from Netcom and a POP based mailer to
handle your mail reading directly on your Mac. You will no longer have
to bitch about downloading your mail to the mac to decrypt it -- you
will be able to just drag and drop mail into PGP with the right
tools. You won't have to worry about MIME with the right package, either.
Display postscript was for windowing systems. It had nothing to do
with document displays per se. I can view postscript just as easily
here on my workstation as ASCII. Display postscript was not a document
viewer technology but a way of building things like NeXTStep, which
did indeed fail -- but thats because X won, and X is in wide use.

If you are using SLIP, you no longer care about graphics on your end

need to have a MIME capable mailer on your end. I understand that the
commercial version of Eudora is o.k. in this regard but not great --

Given that you can get a SLIP account just as easily as a shell
account (i.e. call a provider) and that terminal software is not
notably simpler to configure than SLIP or PPP software (anyone who
thinks otherwise should try explaining what "seven bits, even parity"
or "vt100 emulation" means to a liberal arts major) I'd say that the
arguments being made are specious. They are based on the conjectures
of people who haven't tried, rather than on the experience of those
who have. With a package like "Chameleon", getting a PPP connection
going is a matter of typing in a phone number and a couple of other
magic values to a pretty friendly on-screen form -- which is more or
less the level of effort needed to get a terminal emulator up and
running. It might be different effort -- and certain people like Tim
who are set in their ways might think of the tiny difference as a huge
barrier -- but its not a particularly large effort. As for the money,
these programs are not notably more expensive than commercial terminal
I'd say, in fact, that running via SLIP or PPP is a SMALLER investment
in time and effort because for the naive user running native
applications on their machine with the native help and windowing
systems running is probably a much more comfortable situation than
trying to run "elm" via a weird terminal emulator program.
And yes, I've some experience at what the naive users are like.
There are now boxes you can get from your local bookstore that contain
everything you need -- software, online signup, etc -- to get a PPP or

A remarkably bad article by Peter H. Lewis in today's Times -- front

"Microsoft aquires Church" spoof with problems from anonymity -- in
fact, he opens his article by apparently chalking up the whole episode
to anonymity rather than complete stupidity on the part of anyone
believing an obvious spoof. (The original "AP" article was not
anonymous -- someone just posted a satirical message to the net. The
connection with anonymity is so tenuous as to be nonexistant.)
Things get rapidly worse. Just to list some of the problems, he calls
digital cash a way for people to open swiss bank accounts, confuses
the case of that kid at MIT who was running pirate boards with a case
of anonymity, spreads lots of FUD, gets lots of quotes from some
alarmist professor no one has ever heard of, makes a hash of
explaining why anonymous remailers are useful (and doesn't understand
that forgery and anonymity are sort of inherent in the fabric of the
net), makes a hash of explaining digital signatures, etc. Truly one of
the worst articles I've ever seen in the New York Times on any topic
of any sort -- and given the Times, thats an amazing level to have
fallen to.
The man seems devoid of even a basic understanding of journalism -- as
one example, journalists are supposed to interview the people they are
discussing to get comment (this is nearly the first rule), but he
never bothered to interview a single remailer operator, it seems, even
though he mentions Julf by name. Maybe sending some email to Julf
would have been too much effort, or maybe it would have made the story
less sensationalistic if he'd bothered to be balanced. He didn't seem
to check any of his facts, either (another rule), and the whole thing
reads like an editorial instead of an objective piece of reporting.
I really wonder if Lewis actually lives and works on the internet, or
if he's truly the amateur he seems to be. He comes of as not
understanding the basic mechanics of how things operate day to day
that even a non-technical person would understand.
I would complain somehow to the Times, but I suspect that it would be
impossible to convey properly even the rules of simple journalism that
he broke, even ignoring all the technological misunderstandigs. Sadly,
the editors would have no reason to listen to me, a random guy they'd

Jim choate says:
Because the question "does P=NP" is a question made with respect to an
abstract mathematical model that has nothing to do with the laws of
physics or the "real world". The models it is based on are complete in
and of themselves. Even in a Newtonian universe in which all things
are deterministic, the mathematical concept of a non-deterministic
Turing machine is possible. The notion that physics breakthroughs
might help the problem is based on a complete and utter ignorance of
the way mathematics works. It is as though one could show that the
concept of one half doesn't "work" because in the real world you can
never cut something perfectly in half.
The notion also shows a complete ignorance of automata theory and
its motivations. Turing machines are ALREADY impossible. They exist
only in mens minds.  A real Turing machine could never be built,
period, because they require infinite tapes. A Turing machine is a
MODEL of computation. The notion of a non-deterministic Turing machine
was never based on the concept that such a thing could actually exist,
but on the idea of asking the question "assuming one existed, what
could one do with one that one couldn't do with a "normal" Turing
machine." It is a common exercise in automata theory -- one sees
many exercises of the form "what could you do with an N head M tape
Turing machine, and how much faster can it compute". Did you suppose
that just because one can't build oracles for unsolvable problems that
the mathematics of oracles would suddenly disappear into the void?
It would not have the least effect, any more than one could settle the
question of whether the continuum hypothesis is true.

Andrew Purshottam says:
I'll point out that the countability of the reals (or, rather,
uncountability) is a simple concept -- I've explained it in five
minutes to a twelve year old, so I see no reason why it can't be
quickly explained here. (I haven't paid much attention -- perhaps
someone else has done this already but I haven't noticed it.)
An infinite set is said to be countable if it can be mapped one to one
to the integers. (Actually, to the cardinals, or positive integers, in
most definitions, but it doesn't matter as I'll show in a moment). As
an example, I can map the even positive numbers to the positive
numbers very easily -- use the "divide by two" operator, and I can
map every even positive number to a positive integer, and vice versa.
All integers may be mapped to the positive integers in an equally
simple manner -- start by numbering 0 as 1, 1 as 2, -1 as 3, 2 as 4,
-2 as 5, 3 as 6, and in general all positive n go to 2n and all
negative n go to -2n+1.
It would seem that the rational numbers couldn't be counted, but in
fact they can -- you just have to be clever. Build a table like so
(I've only partially filled it in :-) and think of the row index as the
numerator and the column index as the denominator -- you will swiftly
see that you can number every fraction. (Actually, you overnumber them
in the sense that some numbers get more than one index this way --
fixing this is left as an exercise to the reader...)
       1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8 ....
1      1   3   6  10  15  21  28  36  2      2   5   9  14  20  27  35
3      4   8  13  19  26  34
4      7  12  18  25  33
5     11  17  24  32
6     16  23  31
7     22  30
8     29
Now, you might think some clever trick could be used to map the reals
into the integers. Unfortunately, you cannot do it. I can prove that
quite easily, by contradiction.
For simplicity, lets just try to map the reals between zero and one to
the integers, and lets consider them expressed as binary numbers.
Imagine that I had built a mapping between this subset of the reals
and the positive integers. Any such mapping implies a list, that is,
that I could build a table like
1   .1010101101010010010010010101001.....
2   .0100001010100010100101001001010010...
3.  .11000101001010110100010100010101001....
I can now construct a number that is not in the table. Take the first
binary digit from the first number in the table, and complement it. That
is the first digit in my constructed number. Take the second digit
from the second number and complement it -- that is the second digit
of the constructed number. Add in the complement of the third digit of
the third, the fourth digit of the fourth, etc. The number I have just
constructed can't be the first number in the imaginary table because
the first digit didn't match. It can't be the second because the
second didn't match. It can't be the third because the third doesn't
match. Indeed, it can't be any of them. Thus, you can't map the reals
to the integers.
The reals are thus in some sense a "bigger" infinite set than the
integers.

I do not yet have children. However, I am absolutely certain that in
half the societies on earth I'd be considered someone dangerous to
children. Why? I'm a political "nutcase". I don't believe in the state
controlled version of the institution of marriage (although I believe
in permanent committed monogamous relationships) and thus refuse for
political reasons to marry. I believe in open access to information
for children and a far more liberal view of the rights of children
than most people have. I suspect that when I become a parent, any law
that could be used to "cure" the children of fundamentalist
christians, Amish, etc, would be applied to mine right off the bat --
after all, I'm a dangerous man.
Live and let live, I say. I don't want others judging my child
rearing, and I have little or no desire to judge theirs. Leave them
be unless their idea of discipline for children involves The Rack or
The Firing Squad.

The advantage is that its electronic AND that its secure. Since its

There is another advantage you've glossed over, which is the fact that
since fraud is difficult, anyone, not just vendors, could receive
payment. (Vendor fraud is a huge cost in credit cards.)
I agree, however, that any truly secure electronic payments system has
these advantages -- anonymity isn't needed to gain most of the cost
benefits. I'll also note, by the way, that the stupid smartcard
systems that simply rely on "tamperproof" (ha!) cards that "know"

1) He found a beautiful little defect -- it can be explained in a

   saw it. Its a classic -- he deserves lots of kudos. It permits full
   interoperability between a "rogue" Tessera user and a
   non-rogue user.
2) Its likely that a redesign of the EES (escrowed encryption
   standard) could avoid this defect. Whether it could avoid all
   defects is, of course, unknowable -- but the current design is
   simply flawed and does not truly achieve its stated goal.
3) If the NSA actually worked for years designing this thing, someone
   wasn't thinking.

@_subject: LEAF forgery 
Matt gave me permission to explain the technical details of the paper.
This is the hack. Its idiotically simple.
According to the paper, because of the nature of the communications
involved, the Capstone chip is forced to accept as valid any LEAF with
the right 16 bit checksum. Note that the LEAF contains only the the
chip's ID, the key encrypted in the chip's "secret never to be
divulged except by escrow" key, and this checksum, all encrypted with
the family key.  Since the other chip lacks the "supersecret" key,
it can't check that the session key matches the encrypted session key.
It relies on the checksum for everything. That checksum is a silly 16
bits long.
Thus, you just have to try about 2^15 random LEAFs and you can get one
that works. You can even precompute them if you wish. Its that simple.
Then all you do is send the rogue LEAF instead of a legitimate one. Matt Blaze should be commended for finding such a big hole. As with
most such ideas, its obvious in retrospect but took some good thought
to come up with in the first place.
Let me say also that the NSA should feel highly embarassed. They
fucked up big time. My terror of them from a few days ago when we
heard the Russian Coup intercept story has lessened. Even if they are
years ahead of us, they are still human.
PS There are also a bunch of neat techniques out there for the "lets
say that you don't care about interoperating" case, but they are
naturally less general.

BTW, LEAF/IV pairs are manipulated by Tessera as a single operation. I
suppose this is, in retrospect, a big hint.
The observation that non-synchronized IVs pose little or no problem
was also another "damn; that should have been obvious" that Matt
picked up on and no one else got. I suppose the fact that the NSA
folks mixed the IV into the checksum meant that they thought
non-synchronized IVs would be more significant than they are.

Allow me to clear up a major misconception here, which I initially
shared. According to Matt, the cleartext of the session key and the IV
are both components that go into the checksum. Therefore, the remote
EES unit CAN determine that you've spoofed them if you attempt a
shortcut like reusing a LEAF generated by another unit. You really
have to test lots of pseudoLEAFs against a test unit that you've
handed a session key to.
Sidney Markowitz says:
Correct. However, remember that it tests the checksum against an IV
and session key.
"It depends". Diffie-Hellman, prearrangement, via a public key
mediated exchange, or anything else that seams reasonable.
See above -- the problem is that of finding a LEAF with a proper
checksum that corresponds to the session key.

In general, you can't make credit cards secure by encrypting the

The only information needed to use the card is the card number.  Given

may draw. Stealing the (short) number, which must be communicated to
use the card, is the equivalent of stealing the account. The merchant

have the forward maps as well. However, you can't build something like
that to handle random PGP key IDs. That means that if you want to be
able to look up key IDs automatically in a network wide DNS style
database, you lose. Key IDs need structure so you can trace them to
organizations with delegation over particular sections of the
keyspace, just as in DNS you have structure to domain names so you can
figure out who has delegation over what part of the domain name space.
Anyway, this is the sort of thing I'm thinking about these days.

There isn't one per se -- at least in the sense that none is
standardized since that would be inappropriate. The kind of encryption
gets negotiated in a protocol at another level. swIPe just defines
packet formats, really.  If you want details, you ought to look at the

I believe that the prototype on the disk is just using DES in CBC mode

Given any two distinct keys, k_1 and k_2, it is pretty much guaranteed
that there are at the very least plenty of cyphertexts C_1=E_k_1(P_1)
such that there is a C_2=E_k_2(P_2) with C_1 = C_2 and P_1 != P_2.

to have a giant sack of gold hit you on the head. Even spending a
penny on cracking something that way is uneconomical.
Playing the lottery is an economic lose, plain and simple. Your
expected return is a loss. Having a small number of your workstations
that are otherwise idle trying to crack a DES key that would make you
a million dollars is likely cost effective; your expected return is a
win. Unless the NSA knows something very interesting about factoring
that we don't (not merely an algorithm that is a constant factor of a
million faster, say), trying to crack a 2000 bit RSA key is without
question an economic lose. They could spend a lot less effort simply
getting your key via "practical cryptanalysis". There is therefore no point in using a cryptosystem which would cost
the enemy hundreds of billions of dollars to try to attack and then
type in your key on a machine who's keystrokes can be monitored using
$3000 in equipment. Which way would YOU try to get the keys, eh?
Unless you are already doing all your encryption in a Faraday cage,
I'd say that there is no conceivable point in using anything over a
2000 bit key -- indeed, there is probably no point in using such a key
even if you are doing all your encryption in a Faraday cage. The
benefit is minimal, and the cost, in terms of dramatically slowed
performance, is very high. Using an 8000 bit key is like claiming you
are stronger than the enemy because whereas he only has enough nuclear

Personally, I find the PGP 2.6 announcement to be based on an
extremely flawed premise.
PGP 2.3a and earlier were not American software -- they were written
and produced overseas and were IMPORTED into the U.S.
They infringe on no patents or copyrights when used overseas.
Well, I have lots of correspondants overseas, using perfectly legal
software. They cannot legally use PGP 2.6 -- it isn't exportable.
Therefore, this idiocy will act to cut me off from my overseas
correspondants. I will not be able to use the current version of PGP
and still communicate with them. I will therefore be forced to use
older versions -- probably repeatedly patched versions of 2.5.

any reasonably expert referee -- my selection of choice would be Hal
Finney since he is a well known cypherpunk, is strongly familiar with

given what you are claiming as the presense of what a reasonable
cryptographer would refer to as a "back door". If you have any other
suggested neutral third parties with requisite skill I'll happily tell
you if they are acceptable. Once we've settled on a judge and they've
accepted the charge (we may need to pay the person for their time), we
present our evidence to the person and allow them to make a decision.

Ed Carp says:
Yes. Thats not the algorithm at all. D-H is based on the difficulty of
the discrete log problem, that is, the problem of inverting an
exponentiation modulo a large prime. Its been a while, so I might be forgetting something here or
misstating -- someone correct me if I am wrong.
Suppose we have a field Z_p, where p is a prime. Suppose g is a
generator of the field. Alice generates a random number a. Bob
generates a random number b. Bob tells alice g^b, Alice tells Bob g^a.
Alice knows a and g^b, and thus generates g^(ab) trivially. Similarly,
Bob knows g^a and b, and trivially generates g^(ab). An interceptor
only knows g^a and g^b, and because the discrete log problem is hard
cannot get a or b easily, and thus cannot generate g^(ab).
g^(ab) is now a shared secret of Alice and Bob.

In fact, this whole thing is completely silly. If it were possible to,
say, break IDEA by then encrypting the IDEA output with DES using a

encrypt all IDEA ciphertext he gets with DES and he could break it --
DES then becomes a tool for breaking IDEA. If IDEA is secure, it is
secure against almost all functions (ones selected with knowlede of
the key being the exception) being applied to the ciphertext.
I completely agree that your scheme is in theory more secure. So is a
one time pad. People don't use impractical schemes that actually do
lend real security -- why use one that only adds theoretical security?
If I have a series of encryption functions applied with independent
keys, the only way one can weaken another is if the systems were not
secure in the first place. If one of the systems is secure, no number
of non-secure encryptions applied with random keys is going to ever
weaken it in practice. If it could, that would be the way to break the

It must be for a sum certain in money, payable on a date certain. It
must state the place and person (note -- not necessarily a natural

Typical notes contain other conditions, but those are the keys.
Checks, promisary notes, bank notes (which most of us have never seen
in our lifetimes) and many other similar instruments are all
considered "commercial paper" and are similar in form.
(Checks are interesting in so far as they are an order to the bank to
pay at its premises to the named party, whereas many notes state that
the signatory must pay to the holder at his premises on a particular
time and place. However, such subtleties aren't particularly important
for our purposes.)
The fascinating thing about the rules for commercial paper, by the
way, is that they come from the Law Merchant, which was developed at
medieval trade fairs in merchant courts that had no connection with
any government entity and no overt powers of enforcement...

No, but perhaps you could note that the price of drugs is hundreds of
times higher than it would be without illegalization. Cocaine and
heroin are amazingly cheap per dose before seven layers of smugglers
and dealers get into the act.
I used to pass by the rummy's in lower manhattan on Bowery and
Lafayette Street all the time. I have yet to see a wino on the Bowery
rob anyone to support his habit -- he's got plenty of options to get
fucked up out of his mind for a few dollars a day. If anything, the
currently illegal "white powder" drugs would be far cheaper per dose
than thunderbird.
We might also note that the bulk of the deadly crime associated with
the drug trade is not junkies stealing to pay for their habits but
dealers involved in turf wars. No more gang drive-bys if you legalize
drugs, folks. When was the last time you saw a pair of liquor store
owners having a gun battle over turf?
Beyond this, however, is the inherent foolishness in thinking that
keeping the drugs illegal will do any good. We have already seen that
an order of magnitude increase in the money spent on drug enforcement
over the last decade has produced NO noticeable change in the size of
the drug trade, and has, if anything, made the problem worse. Drugs
are even available in maxium security prisons, where, supposedly,
there is absolute control over what enters and what leaves. Given
that, there is no quantity of money we could possibly spend that would
stop the drug trade -- even unto the point of eliminating all human
freedom in our society.
I am unwilling to sell my birthright for a mess of pottage. We are
sacrificing billions of dollars and all our civil rights for NOTHING
VISIBLE AT ALL. Even were you correct that drugs were an intolerable
menace to society it has long been obvious that drug law enforcement
does no good whatsoever in lowering the rate of drug "crime" and if
anything causes harm by driving the price up and creating a huge
profit opportunity for the unscrupulous.

You claim this imperfection is reason to consider it to be "community

As I noted, were your argument correct, then your car would not be

In any case, given that Eric can simply kick anyone off the list or
add anyone on that he likes at will, you are free to refer to the list
as a commune, an empire, or a supreme overlordship with yourself as
supreme overlord. The fact remains that Eric can implement any change
he has unilaterally. If you don't like the term "property" call it

that your opinion can influence him but that ultimately the decisions

No society thus far has succeeded. Every government in history to date
has descended into corruption or warfare and fallen one way or another
within at most a few hundred years. I place my faith in what I can
see, not on what I can speculate about. Thus far no one has succeeded
in stopping this sort of decay, and I have no reason to believe the
U.S. is any different. "Eternal Vigilance" is a nice phrase, but it
doesn't appear that its ever happened. Its fine to say that it would
be nice for the people to guard their own rights -- but since they
never do, one might as well talk about how it would be nice if
everyone was morally perfect.
They've never failed -- thats the thing. France has had five or six or
seven governments since its revolution depending on how you count
them. Italy's government was barely a few years old following the last
war when it became nothing more than a graft generator. Of all the
nations of Europe, only England in some sense can be said to have
survived more than the last sixty or seventy years without a major
change of government -- and it might be said that England's government
changed radically following the reforms of the last century and the
Parliament Act of 1911. (Well, some of the Scandanavian countries are
also partial exceptions, but not especially big ones.) Europe is
considered the "advanced" part of the workd, ladies and gentlemen.
The U.S.'s record of surviving over 200 years without a major upheaval
is quite an unusual thing.
But the people almost never resist. Usually, they want the bad
government -- it needs them to survive.

I've been looking at the RC4 (or alleged RC4) code a bit.
Unlike most ciphers, RC4 doesn't seem to have any particular word
length dependancies in its principles. That is to say, a cipher like
IDEA has lots of magic numbers involved, but RC4 does not, which means
that one could, in principle, extend it from being byte oriented
stream to being word oriented stream without causing particular
harm. (It would, of course, become incompatible, but thats not a real
issue.) Can anyone see any reason why one could not change RC4 to
being a word oriented stream cipher, call it "ERC4"?
The reason I ask is because this would speed things up by a factor of
four on 32 bit machines, which would mean modest hardware could
possibly break 100mbps speeds. The 64 bit extension on 64 bit RISC
processors could go far, far, faster still.
This is a real consideration in the protection of network traffic,
where extremely fast encryption in software has been a stumbling block.

law. Then, the patent finally gets granted -- resulting in lots of
people suddenly finding that the product they've been building for

S10/51 (the time to en/decrypt a 64-byte block is trivial), so you can
test 2^12 keys per second on a S10, or 2^12*16 = 2^16 keys/sec on a
16-processor SparcCenter-1000. That's 2^16 * 2^17 keys per day, so you
need 2^9 days to exhaustively search a 40-bit keyspace on a fairly
common machine such as the S1000. Move that back down to 2^13 days for
a S10; The CS dept easilly has 2^8 machines with the average speed of
a S10 (some are slower, some are a LOT faster, and tehy have more than
256 machines anyway). That means that, by dedicating the CS dept's
resources, we can crack a 40-bit key in 2^7 days (2^6 on the average,
of course). As another example, Lehman has 2^11 S10 equivalents, so
that figure would go down to 2^2 days or a 4-day weekend.
Well, the above goes to prove that 40bits isn't all that much (which
we already knew), but I wanted to get a feel of what it means it terms
of resources that mere mortals like us have access to.

over TCP, why use SLIP encapsulation? It was designed for unreliable
links -- on a reliable link, you can save lots of grief by just
sending the packet -- total length of an IP datagram is included
inside the datagram, thus rendering further encapsulation unnecessary.

strick at The Yak says:
I don't want to scare people into not doing things -- but I do want to
inform. Persons taking my opinion, or that of any authority, on face
value without doing their own reasoning, get what they deserve.
Then do it...
Well, in the long term, my hope is that people use IPSP for this. It
will mean that the kernels on their machines simply deal with all this
stuff and that userland applications get to ignore it 90% of the time.
And the telnet; however, it has a library to let you do whatever you want.
In v5 there is more general support, I believe.
Thats really an interface issue, I think -- they have a lot of the
fundamental stuff down. If thats one's only complaint with Kerberos (I
have others) the "right thing" is to build a simplified administration
system. Thats quite untrue -- passwords in kerberos are set by the users, not
by the administrators!
You only need ISODE for the ASN.1 compiler; you don't have to build
the whole thing.
There is swIPe, and the derived TIS product. Its a bit primitive since
it doesn't handle per-socket keying. There is stuff that I'm hacking
on between flames -- its going to be called swIPe II. It will conform
to my RFC drafts and should run out of the box on any 4.4BSD
system. I'm hoping people will back-port it to SunOS and the like.
There is also SSL, which is what the Netscape people are pushing --
stands for Secure Sockets Layer.
There is also the thing this guy Andy Heffernan did a draft on in
which you do this at the TCP layer; he uses a TCP option to pass IVs
and MACs.
There is also the method proposed by the AFT working group at the
IETF, a.k.a. the "socks" working group, for encrypting sockets.
There is also the thing that Miron Cuperman wrote for YTalk. It did
diffie-hellman key exchange followed by an encrypted session.
There are about three or four more that I can't bring to mind at the
moment but I'm damn sure I've seen them.
Diffie-Hellman doesn't give you real security without some sort of way
to authenticate the exchange. Man in the middle gets you. You are then
down to either using signed exchanges or some sort of challenge or
conventionally keyed way of authenticating.
BTW, Kerberos most emphatically does not require active
administration. I've run it in an environment with thousands of hosts
with narry a person paying it any attention.
Well, this is an admirable goal. Of course, the Netscape people want
to do the same thing with SSL, and others have proposed to do it, too.
Ultimately, the thing that is going to fix the net is IP layer
encryption -- anything at a higher layer can't really fix all the
problems reliably. (As an example, consider RST attacks against TCP
connections.) It also can't fix them pleasantly.
Meanwhile, of course, it is going to be a while before that stuff is
universally deployed. My reference implementation isn't going to be
here before April. It will be freely available, but it will only run
on some architectures, and it is unlikely to be idiot friendly or
perfect out of the box day one.
Understand, also, that as one of the few people here who writes code I
don't want to discourage you from continuing by any means!
However, I'd say that this isn't going to be a permanently deployed
thing on the net -- that much we can be pretty sure of.
Probably people aren't that enthusiastic about them. Encrypted
sessions are in wide use for telnet and the like -- I do that sort of
thing regularly, and now that session stealing has become a fact of
the net I suspect that S/Key is going to vanish and be replaced by
various encrypted telnets. SMTP it doesn't make much sense to protect
because what you really want to protect is the contents -- i.e. via
PEM, MIME security multiparts, or some similar method (I favor PGP'ed
secure multiparts myself.)
Why? Why not just do the original calls? If you are trying to overlay
shared libraries, just rename the calls in the symbol tables or
relink the library or something similar...

TIA is sort of a short term hack people are using to get around having
to have their administrators manage SLIP or PPP properly; I suspect
this difficulty will vanish with time.
Well, IBM of all firms is trying very hard to make sure you are, and
Microsoft is even investing in UUNet to try to make sure of it, too.
Remember, by the way, that PPP is far cheaper per customer than shell
accounts, even though moronic providers right now don't make it look
that way.
IP is ultimately designed to be a proxy protocol that will work over
anything -- stuff like TIA simply gets around temporary mental

Theis will not work, Hal, because it would mean that administrative
control over keys would have to be held by people far removed
organizationally and spacially from those who own them. Things work
much better when the administrators and users are close
together. Futhermore, the DNS style solution scales -- it
automatically aquires servers to meet demand as the space expands,
unlike a pseudo-distributed system such as the one you
propose. Furthermore, DNS is one of the few really large scale
distributed databases that has been well proven, and piggybacking off

So you use TCP -- DNS already supports that. In any case, however, the
reassembly size and lowest common denominator MTUs are being jacked
way up for IPv6.
I very strongly disagree. Even today, we find more and more bugs in
DNS. If we had to start from scratch, we'd have to build an
infrastructure like DNS all over again, only to find that we suffer
from all the same old bugs and end up with a parallel implementation
that looks almost exactly like DNS only less reliable.

addresses are only 32 bits, so the problem of mapping them into
hostnames should be easy to do in a flat database, right?
If you'd like to volunteer to run the centralized databases containing
the (at least) five billion keys for the population of the planet,
including handling tens to hundreds of billions of hits against them
per day, and probably tens of millions of updates per day (perhaps
you'd like us to enter them by hand, too?) and you'd like to supply

algorithms remain stable on your most optimistic estimate (which would
require some advances even so), we would assume that factoring would
remain exponential, and that adding a constant number of bits to a

complexity. Since computing speeds are also rising exponentially, but
not superexponentially, we would assume that the number of bits we

Mike Duvos says:
I'm on both sides of this issue. On the one hand, the people in the
open crypto community are now, or soon will, substantially exceed in
number the people in the black community, and the people in the open
community have certain advantages in the way that they do their
work. On the other hand, the people in the black community have the
advantage that they can read anything that the open community produces
but not vice versa, and they have at least a 15 year edge in knowledge
about the design of conventional systems, and who knows (we certainly
have no idea) how much of an edge in the modern cryptographic
arena. We don't know for sure if the NSA knew about Public Key before
the open community did. Certainly they knew of differential
cryptanalysis and similar techniques, and they must know quite a lot
that we don't.
The black community also has lots of day-to-day experience that we
don't have, and they understand both the threat model and the
practical side of things a lot better than we do.
Overall, I'd say that in the long run the open community is going to
catch up regardless of what the NSA likes. That does not mean,
however, that this is going to happen particularly soon, or that they
don't still know decades more than we do.

Martha is a de facto disbarred attorney, who, along with her equally

could have simply sent their letters in on their own for free. The net
reacted rather violently to their spamming, because unlike most
rational individuals they contended that they were doing something
perfectly decent and honest. People stopped them in the long run by
rigging up cancelbots to administer the Usenet death penalty to them.

Peter should take some responsibility for perpetuating Mr. Canter and
Ms. Siegel. He failed, in my opinion, to properly reflect the
situation in his articles about it in The Times. In particular, he did
very little to convey that the two are de fact disbarred attorneys who
had played the same games in "real space" that they had in Cyberspace
and had been dragged through the coals by the Florida bar association
for it because to almost anyone what they had been doing was a gross
ethical violation.
He also made it seem as though internet users were opposed to
advertising, when, of course, advertising has been on the net for many
many years, and newsgroups like comp.newprod exist to publish nothing
but ads. He didn't properly convey that the defect in their behavior
had been the jamming of other people's communications with their ads,
rather than the act of advertising per se -- much like someone
standing up during a town meeting on some local matter and starting to
declaim loudly not on the purpose of the meeting but instead about how
great their legal services were.
Peter also did little to interview anyone with substantial standing in
the internet community about what C&S were doing -- a quote or two
from an old net hand like a Gene Spafford or someone of that ilk might
have been valuable. As it was, he didn't produce much to counter the
viewpoint that they were the victims rather than the victimizers.
I think it is only because the "paper of record" published articles

they managed to survive this long. As it is, the Tennessee Bar is

I doubt it. It really hasn't proved to be an actual problem thus
far. If anything, the limiting factor on scalability is the fact that
the net has no locality of reference, which is making routing design
harder and harder. Routing is currently THE big unsolved problem on
the net -- something outsiders to the IETF rarely suspect, because the
engineers have been faking it so well for so long. Unfortunately, all

Can't be done. Sorry. There are certain flaws in the design of the
internet protocols down on the transport layer that I'd rather not get
into because they don't seem to be widely known and I'm not interested
in making them better known.
Sendmail already has such limits. Unfortunately they ultimately do no
good. I'd try explaining, but the details get too technical -- if
people insist I'll get into it. The gist is, however, that in the
current network its too easy to fake connections. Even with per client
limits I could still make your machine die a horrible death.
Not usually, actually. The "utilities" have nothing to do with the
kernel, and the kernel is what can crash the machine.
Those sorts of security problems are not only well known but largely
gone. The last one, in sendmail's debug flag, could only hurt a
machine by action of a user on the machine itself, not over the
network. The sorts of things I'm talking about are *inherent* in the
design of TCP and cannot be altered at this point.
Name one, Mr. Donald. Name a single one.
Sorry, but you just don't know what you are talking about here,
period. We don't know how to solve the routing problem in the general
case. Thats one of the reasons for all the arguments in the IETF
concerning the problems we are getting ourselves into with route
(Just so you are clear here, Mr. Donald, the routing problem is NOT
the problem of finding an optimal path between all pairs of nodes on a
network in polynomial time -- thats solved and absolutely useless.)
Nope, not a bug. There are problems that we don't know how to
The problem is routing agregation, you understand, and the fact that
agregated clouds don't really experience locality of reference. This
means that we end up with nasty and totally artificial network choke
points as the networks scale. If we transmit full information,

tables because they are too big.

And my mother is a bicycle.
NT is about as secure as VMS was, i.e. not at all. Its just got

You mean, it makes proof of security possible for real programs? That
there is a proof of security available for the NT kernel? I'd settle
for a proof of non-crashing myself. Short of that I'm unaware of any

to break the system. If Mr. Donald can name an operating system that

And of course, DOS has never added options to new versions of the system.
Yup. Recently, I ported about 80,000 lines of code in a day. It wasn't
much of a challenge -- because I knew how to program, of course. I had
to hack some compatibility libraries, and it took about another day
and a half to back-patch the original sources so that the program
compiled without problems on both architectures.
Thats because its fully automated. Would you prefer to do the job by hand?
Remember, Unix handles things that PCs never even dreamed of -- like
endianness considerations, which you don't get if you are chained by
the ankle to one shitty processor.
I've never seen that, but then again I'm just on drugs. Naturally, of

The shell doesn't accept regular expression syntax, so this shouldn't
be the least bit suprising.
Not at all true -- you can use skill, or if a process is a current job
you can do stuff in most shells like
kill %procname

Some of us have spent the last several days not getting sleep and
going to meetings here in Stockholm -- defining security standards,
talking to Microsoft people about IPSP integration into Win '95 and
Windows NT, recruiting people to work on the project we have to make
sure that the IETF meeting in Dallas in a few months will have IPSP
security. We hope to have the whole infrastructure of the internet
encrypted within a year or two. I believe that between IPSP for the
links and MOSS (and SHTTP using MOSS for document security) we should
have the whole thing wrapped up in a couple of years. Problems still
to solve include security for the internet's routing protocols,
protection against denial of service attacks, etc.
Remailers and the like are still worthwhile areas for effort, of
course, but I think of those of applications of the secure
Those people who would rather work than talk are invited to start
reading the internet drafts (some of which are soon to be RFCs) and
help out with the effort. I suspect that a big push from about 25
people could manage to implment just about everything we want and then
we could go on and live the rest of our lives.
There is a lot of real hard work to do in the next year or two and I

I'm not that worried. HESIOD has already shown that you can afford to
store really mongo databases in the DNS, and with caching I suspect
the TCP activity isn't going to be over very wide distances for the
most part. However, we will likely find out the answers in the next
few months.
PS Cypherpunks write code.

I would guess the same.

I believe that the -ah-xx.txt draft is missing.

I'll just have to put it into my IPSP implementation, then. I am more
than willing to pay a few tens of thousands to lawyers for this
particular purpose. I will produce a text description of the algorithm
and have an intern re-implement it from scratch just to make sure --
I'll probably prepare some notarized documents attesting to the
development methodology, too.  It will be fun to see if Jim Bidzos
actually tries to pull something under those circumstances.

Given all the prior art, I have a solid suspicion that the patent
wouldn't hold up. The existance of the publically published Diffie
Hellman patent, for instance, makes it rather hard to patent the
more general case.

As a security consultant, I'm very happy about Java because once the
holes are found in it and massive, Morris style worms are launched
with it, I'll be laughing all the way to the bank.
I exagerate only slightly. I don't believe Java to be secure, in spite
of the claims. Its too complicated, and it operates in an environment
who's correct operation is required for it to remain secure. Good
system design says that you want a system's failure mode to produce a
secure result, but thats not what Java does.

You are incorrect. Applets are DESIGNED to be tightly constrained in
what they do. You want to bet your career that there are no bugs in
the implementation of this design? The thing keeping you from opening
sockets or doing file-io is a very thin scrim. Are you *certain* that
it is bug free? I'm not.
Are you willing to bet your career that its bug free? Thats my question.
Don't get me wrong -- Mosaic also bothers me, as does Netscape. Java,
however, gives me the willies.
*designed*. Can you be certain that both the design and the
implementation are bug free?
I like systems that are more fail-safe. About half a dozen
simultaneous bugs would be needed to break some of my more secure
firewalls, for example. Java does *not* provide security in depth.

I see little reason for such confidence.
Thats far from true as well. The Java interpreter could have all its
I/O abilities removed, for example, rather than relying on correct
implementation of the possibly correct language model to keep users
from performing I/O. -- I can name lots of similar things.
Having designed systems to be as secure as possible, I'd say that Java
violates lots of the constraints. Its too big, too complicated, and
relies for its security on the correctness of its implementation.
Again, this depends on the correctness of the implementation.

Yes it is.
I know lots of users that would like to do certain dangerous things,
but they are better off not being able to do them because if they
could very likely the security problems would mean in six weeks their
company would be bankrupt and they wouldn't have a job.
Not all cool things are desirable things.
I suspect that the java-like methodology of downloading small apps to
users can be done securely, but the java model doesn't feel like the
right way to do it, at least to me.
