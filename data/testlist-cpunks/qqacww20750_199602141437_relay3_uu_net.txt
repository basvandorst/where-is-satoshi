Which simply proves my point;  money is not the limiting factor, here.
But remember, Rushdie is merely ONE PERSON.  And keeping him safe has consumed a lot of resources.  You don't think the government could protect each of their most publically hated employees to a similar level if a reward of, say, $20,000 were put on each of their heads.  How much could we collect to "get" Lon Horiuchi, for example?  Or the hundred or so agents immediately participating in the initial Waco incident, or the dozen or so decision makers immediately above them?   Etc.
The Rushdie incident is simply so far removed from "Assassination Politics" that it can't possibly be used to refute it; I still believe it actually demonstrates how much effort somebody has to go to, to protect a targeted person.  One targeted person is easy to protect.  10,000 would be FAR harder.  And the moment a few of those guys got "whacked," the rest would want to resign their jobs and hope they would be allowed to retire in peace.
In a sense, qualitatively you absolutely correct, but (quantitatively) you're wrong.  I think the problem is that when most people hear the term "Assassination", they think of only the highest-level targets.  Quite the contrary; I think this system will get the medium and even the lower-level people FIRST, de-populating the government primarily by hurried resignations of worried people.  The remaining  people would be terrified to actually make anybody angry, and they wouldn't have a paycheck because they couldn't collect any taxes.  The whole system would collapse in a heap.
