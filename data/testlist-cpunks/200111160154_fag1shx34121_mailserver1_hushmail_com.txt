Anthrax is almost the same organism as Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which is produced commercially as a pesticide. The two organisms can be grown and prepared in the same way. Because Bt is generally considered harmless, the facilities producing it probably have not been investigated as possible sources of the anthrax material.
