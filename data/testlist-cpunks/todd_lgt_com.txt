Yo Fred, nobody said you wer not right on the money, just that these issues
clearly have fixes and are part and parcel to a pre-adolesencent product,
not a mature one.
Yes, you get two points for posting the bug report, but lose one for
soap-boxing about the woes of the product in general... Keep up the good
work, just drop the proslitizing and we all wouldn't mind hearing your rap.
BTW - If your or your friends are up for a game of speed-chess... I'm
willing, I used to be *rated* until I dropped off the circuit a few years
ago... Winged Benoni, Classical Ruy, or maybe an Accellerated Dragon (for
those who play the black)... I won't even charge you the nominal 5$ fee...

For the most part this scenario would work. The Java Applett that is doing
secure or authenticated work clearly must employ some form of embedded
A cute trick we are employing in one applet under development here at LGT
is an embedded stream based bi-directional encryption engine. It provides a
direct mechanism to encrypt the data stream within the TCP datagram rather
than outside of it. Since the datagram itself is untouched the simple
interface that Java employs is unfettered. However this proces adds some
performance overhead but allows for a virtual private network to be
constructed directly from the server to the applet context.
This project/concept will be released sometime in January along with some
underpinnings to plug into the FSTC EPayment Handler and its Architecture
along with the applett itself... Yes we will share it with the
CypherPunks... It's the best way I know to get a public testing/err bashing
and beta cycle on a concept.,
We really are not trying to build a product in this effort, rather the
intent  is to prove that although the general "external transport" is/may
be unsecured, that the internal or upper layers do not necessarily suffer
from the same security leakage or process models, and that secure
transactions can successfully be layered upon these "existing"
underpinnings if they are adapted properly.
This is especially true with both HiJacking and Spoofing attack modalities.
But in our model with the upper layers events are synchronized and
validated such that there is little chance for these attack modalities to
Again for the world to hear - The Java concept is a Transport Harness, not
the entire magilla. Clearly that is what is going on here... Without thewse
upper layers it is no safer than normal netscape or any other browser

The real issue is not NFS itself but RPC and the interface layer between
the system and these layered services. In fact holes also exist in RLOGIN,
REXEC, and RSH (ports 512,513, and 514).
Cant tell you how many secure systems we have broken because of these
little goodies.
The real issue is that by itself TCP/IP has no security to speak of, and
more importantly the concept of secure messaging goes much farther than
just keeping prying eye's off the data contained within. For instance
Commerce Models require synchonization of process events in order to manage
OLTP properly. TCP/IP in and of itself is really unusable for these tasks
without something like the ISIS messageing protocol and process control
1interface above the protocol stack.
All in all it's a complex nut to crack.

Pardon the flame but I really have just about heard enough of this BS...
Dr. Fred, you seem to spend a lot of engery slamming Java and HotJava. Are
you unaware that the HotJava Platform is the first generation pass at an
inline extensible GUI harness. Underline the total concept "extensible GUI
harness". This includes a series of tool functions to *help* perform secure
messeging (like those supplied iun Netscape 2.0/Java.), but because of the
enormity of the task and the number of facets on the face of this gem it
will be some time before the final versions of the first generation will be
No one else had been working on this piece of technology before SMCC
started their effort. From the word floating about the SMCC labs they
didn't even know what they had.
So rather than slamming them, SMCC, or their PR folks for
   - releasing a version of a development tool far beyond what the "big boy's
   - doing what PR people do - Minimize and Maximize concepts in the press
I hope that you understand my point?. The net/net is that OLTP needs to be
scaleable to be a saleable commodity and without the ability to do
"java-ish" like local applets... There is no clean way to do this,
***period***. Also that OLTP requires transport level security, transaction
level security , and a whole lot of systems security and authtication. The
browser is the harness not the complete tool suite at this juncture.
As an aside - What blows my mind is the number of cycles people spend
bitching and moaning about Java itself rather than working to create a
better solution.
I just want to say "Get a clue. Moan about something that is important and
pertinent to the technologies at hand".
These comments are my own -

My apologies, I should have taken this off-line with Dr. Fred. I did in my
response to him as I had some personal commentary to add which would have
beebn inappropriate to the list in general.
But you are right. These lists are meant for us to exchange important
information and technologies, not necessarily commentary as to what a piece
of merde" something is.
I respect Dr' Fred's commentary and others where there is a "prize" for all
of us, but so much of the postings now happening seem to be of little
technical value.
Again I aploogize to all and to you Dr. Fred for posting my response to

Sorry abopt the above flame-war I caused.
My point was almost benign in and of itself. Yes, the Java concept is
sound, No, the currently available implementation has some real
architectural considerations that must be addressed in order that we can
build a stable and secure platform atop it.
My real issue is that there is so much time spent on this list knocking the
individual spokes that make up this wheel we call Electronic Commerce, that
it is more and more costly to filter out the technology from the background
noise. Still because of the value of that technology, I and others are
forced to spend precious hours reviewing all that comes across our desks.
Bluntly being an active member of several Security and Payment Mechanism
working groups I view some 150+ pieces of email a day and sometimes get
frustrated by the amount of noise, or the roar in the background, about
what are to the largest percentage of us, meaningless dribble... Still
there is the occaisional golden nugget that makes it all worth while..
Again My apologies to have stirred up this mess. I will retreat under my
desktop from the mele' that seems to be unending.

Ughhh, Me too..., Dr. Fred scores 2 Points!
I think there are reallty two bigger conceptual issues up for bashing about
here, and they are different. It is unlikely that they can be by the same
protocol... They both are valid transaction models and must be met.
The one - Authentication Based transactions, i.e. I am doing *stuff* from a
"known" system or "authenticated channel". These transactions are based
upon a level of trust that I say I am who I am and that my "tresources" are
as they are protrayed to be. Clearly there is an electronic trail generated
here. This is the "credit card" model.
The other, -  What I now call "Unauthenicated transactions" are based upon
the actual resource's being authenticated rather than myself being
Hence if you follow this model to extrapolate that these two types of
"environments" exist, that of "known and trusted users" and that of
"unknown users, but trusted cash". They are inb and of itself what will
drive the need to both collect and enforce privacy for both types of
IMHO - Anything less just wont fly long term. This concept of collecting
client data has to be a part of the "Known Entity" Transaction Models and
relegated to stay within that context. "Unknown Entity" transaction
processing will have to be made avalaiable as well with anonimity being
insured as part of the process model.

Ray scribes:
Not so laborious, the brunt of C1 and C2 testing is accomplished by a test
suites that do topical levels only. The issue is that there is a NCSC
engineer watching it happen. Hence if oit passes it is "blessed".
As per the orange book itself, C2 is about the lowest level of "Secure"
that you can get. In fact if Microsoft had gone to the trouble of a B1 or
B2 rating this would have been impressive but since most systems analysts
have not been familiarized with the levels of system accounting and access
control/logging that represents the various levels of "Orange Book" Rating
it is somewhat superfluous.
No Doubt;  NT should be easily hacked in the upcomming months by any number
of mortals let alone the gods themselves. What UNIX has that NT doesn't
(which makes it more vuknerable to attack) is 20 more years of evolution,
More copies, everybody knows it (at least in our group)...
As per NT's orange book C2 Rating... C2 is about the lowest level of Secure
that you can get. In fact I personally am unimpressed, rather it is a box
on an RFQ that gets checked Very few people run C anything sites in
reality. If Microsoft had gone to the trouble of a B1 or B2 rating this
would have been cool but since most system's analysts have not been
familiarized with the levels of system accounting and access
control/logging that represents the various levels of "Orange Book" Rating
it is somewhat superfluous.
This is especially true since the Folks at the FRB and FDIC/FSLIC
orgaizations are more likely to require B2 or the like on the National
Standards for "blessed" commerce Engines (I wonder what the FSTC has to say
about this?). Seems to me like the "Evil Empire" is just puffing it's chest
for a very very small market...
IMHO - Military sites passing real classified data usually are not run on
anything as low as C2. If you want a secure os, look at the Harris Computer
Corp's B1-Certified version of ES/MP UNIX (they call it CX/SX). FOUO - For
Official Use Only sites often run C1/C2 based OS's for Audit training but
are usually not part of the Trusted Computing Base and as such not real
threats. Still the most common problem is human not the OS. Not the actual
OS itself,.
Not necessarily on the NSA, you have to start somewhere and they do a good
job as far as NIST and NCSC efforts are concerned. If you can do better
then you have a good career in commercial cracking or will have lots of
time on your hands (Federal Food is the Pits, and the golf course is gone
from Lompoc!).

@_subject: FSTC - What is it... 
In answer to your question:
I am not the official spokesperson for the organization. In fact I serve on
a working group in an advisory and design review capacity. However I can
tell you that:
The Financial Services Technology Consortium (FSTC) is a
consortium of financial services providers, national laboratories,
universities, and government agencies who sponsor and participate in
non-competitive collaborative research and development on interbank
technical projects.
The home page is located at
     and although still under construction offers pointers to a number of our
projects like e-check and electronic-payment-handler as well as
fraud-prevention tools and technologies. As to the actual posting of the
wqebsite I just finished this yesterday so it will be listed pretty much in
all the "cool places".
a good point of contact for FSTC is: Dan.Schutzer at citicorp.com (Dan, please
forgive me for giving the world your name!)
I personally see FSTC as the strongest player in the secure e-commerce
effort and would advise any banking and other financial services players
(including the bond and stock houses) to get onto their bandwagon,
This leads me to believe that because of their Federal
Involvement/Sponsership, that they will indeed become *the* defacto
standards organization.
As to the meetings planned they are scheduled for the
10-Oct-95       E-Payment Working Group - Security Services, Cambridge Mass.
11-Oct-95       W3C meeting , Cambridge Mass.
26-Oct-95       E-Payment Working Group , General Meeting, Teaneck, NJ.
Hope this answers your questions...
