@_subject: [pfSense] Can pfSense be considered trusted? What implementations of VPNs can now be trusted? 
I personally choose the ciphers that are "hardware" optimized, since my
low-end home router (ALIX) gets me faster vpn performance when I do, and I
transfer files to/from office all the time. So if the GUI recommends XYZ
because it is hardware accelerated, I choose it.
That said, a lot of the panic-driven-secure-your-web-sites-against-the-NSA
instructions recommend enabling ciphers that use ephemeral session keys.
The OpenSSL included in pfSense 2.1 supports many of these. Type this
"/usr/local/bin/openssl ciphers" to see them all. The ones that end with
"E" in the first component are the ones with the ephemeral key-. Now, how
to convince the GUI to make use of these for IPsec or OpenVPN I do not
know. I'm sure you can do it via direct config file tweakage, though. I
think IPsec renegotiates keys every 60 minutes anyway, so they'd have to do
a lot of key breaking to snoop your data, unless they could predict your
keys or sneak a MitM attack on you.
To list the "strong" ciphers only, use this: /usr/local/bin/openssl ciphers
