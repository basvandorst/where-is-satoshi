My impression is that Byzantium's ad-hoc mesh network would look a whole lot *like *the networks we're used to, though. If it grew big enough. Am I mistaken? Maybe Byzantium doesn't scale the way I've assumed it does, and you'd end up with a sort of "clumpy" situation, where you have less of a global Internet and more of a smattering of smaller imperfectly-connected internets. I guess that's implied by the emphasis on wireless connections
