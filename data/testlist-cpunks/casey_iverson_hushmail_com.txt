Content-type: text/plain
Tim's position's are more anti-Isreal and pro Arab than anti-Jewish.
Even if he is a closet anti-Semite, as some have alleged in the past, he has a right to his view.
But is this the appropriate list for such views?

Tim May feels as sorry for the dead in Israel as Arafat and the Taliban feel for the dead in NYC and DC.
Sorry Tim. Every one in Washington was not killed, but maybe next time.

Tim May is as sincere about his sorrow for the dead in Israel as Arafat and the Taliban are about the dead in NYC and DC.
Sorry Tim, not all dead in Washington, only a couple of hundred.
Well maybe next time.
