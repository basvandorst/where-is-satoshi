@_subject: PGP Shell for the Amiga 
Hi, I'm new to this forum and I was wondering if there was a front end
for the Amiga version of PGP.  I am currently using ver2.2 of PGP for the
Amiga under OS2.04.  Please let me know as this would make life a little
bit easier.  Thank you.

@_subject: PGP 2.3 for Amiga 
some news to report.  It is a bit buggy.  Had trouble signing and
encrypting with my secret key.  Is 2.3 backward compatible with 2.2?  I'm
running an A3000T with an '040 accelerator @ 25mhz.  Please let me know if
any of you have experienced similar problems.  Thanx in advance!

for a wide range of transactions.  For example. I have an ATM card that
was issued on my checking account.  With it, I can make purchases at any
place displaying the Interlink symbol.  This includes gas stations, fast
food places, and a lot of common stores such as the Good Guys, Circuit
City, etc.
conveinent than carrying cash money.  No large demoninations to worry
about, and if you are robbed, they have to crack your PIN to use the card.
If they use a portabel reader, you could be screwed.  But, in most cases
you would have time to call customer service and cancel the card.

Well, what I'm trying to say is that I, in no way, have access to a Unix
prompt line.  I am restricted to menus in which I must choose from the
listed choices.  Gnu zip is not supported by the service through which I
gain my Internet access.  Is Gnu zip available for the Amiga and/or IBM?

IRC serve that is up and running.  Are there any current IRC servers that
I could telnet to?  Bradenville.andrew.cmu.edu does not exist and neither
does santefe.santafe.edu.  Those two were given to me as was 131.130.39.27
6668.  However, that site does not seem to respond to any login attempts.
