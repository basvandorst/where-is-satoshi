Dear Bung:
Is there a PEANUTS(R) fan on your list?
Share the charm of PEANUTS this holiday season with gifts from Hallmark. Your local Gold Crown Store is the Official PEANUTS Holiday Headquarters, and Hallmark.com continues the fun online. You'll find the best selection of PEANUTS cards, plush, collectibles and gifts at Look for "The Joy of A PEANUTS Christmas" Holiday Book. It's free when you visit your local store and purchase just three Hallmark cards. You'll love this nostalgic look back at PEANUTS holiday comics through the years. For the Hallmark Gold Crown Store nearest you, turn to our online store locator service. If you'd rather shop online, we've chosen three PEANUTS cards to package together with the book; it can be purchased for just $5.95. Click below to order "The Joy of a PEANUTS Christmas."
Online, you can win the same giant plush Snoopy that you've seen in your local store. Just send one of our free PEANUTS e-cards and you're automatically entered. We'll select a new winner every day, so enter often. Here's the link to our free e-card section:
