FROST & SULLIVAN STUDY -- LOCAL VOICE SERVICES THROWN OPEN BY TELECOM ACT OF 1996
Designed to create a competitive environment, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was an invitation to companies from different market segments to vie for the same market share
in the public local wireline and wireless voice services market.  The
question now is, how well has it worked?   According to new strategic research from Frost & Sullivan U.S. Markets for Public Local Wireline and Wireless Voice Services, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 has created the most significant
business opportunity since the long distance market was opened for
true competition 13 years ago.  Many companies are entering the local wireline services market such as interexchange carriers (IXCs),
competitive access providers (CAPs), cable TV service providers (CATV) and utility companies, as well as wireless voice service providers such as cellular carriers, Personal Communications Service
(PCS) providers and wireless local loop voice service providers.
