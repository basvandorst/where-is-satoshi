Thank you for posting the "Compromised Remailers" article:
Over the past year, many remailer users have noticed that the reliability of the Mixmaster type II network has steadily degraded. Although it may well be the result of TLA interference, the remailer community's statistical methods of selecting a "reliable" remailer chain contribute significantly to the network's degradation.
As a former employee of the United States Army Communications Command [USACC] Headquarters, I was amazed to stumble upon the existence of a publicly available communications medium permitting truly anonymous communication by hampering the government's ability at "traffic analysis," or tracking an email message from its source to its destination. One would have to be foolish to believe that TLAs are not hard at work trying to pierce the veil of anonymity afforded by the Mixmaster type II, and, the yet to be released, type III remailers.
I ran tests in September, October & November, and provided the Mixmaster developers & remail operators with the same results I've included below. My testing was extremely simple: send a bunch of messages, and note which messages arrived. [The same procedure an accountant would use in tracking a financial transaction from its origin to its destination.]
What I found was that a handful of remailers accounted for virtually all of the un-delivered email messages. Yet, these same remailers, that never delivered my email messages to the "alt.anonymous.messages" news group, where also listed as among the most reliable remailers in mixmaster stats used to select remailer chains.
I've included my recommendations to improve the network's reliability in the test results below.
