You're both correct, but you don't mention one point which you both
surely know: the net spans all kinds of cultures.  Including those where
erotic pictures of post-pubescent (but under the US's age of consent)
are legal.  And those (admittedly exotic and 'primitive', but existant)
cultures that totally fuck with US norms, e.g., the grandfather teaches
his granddaughter
about sex by doing it, and women get married at 15.  So even if
you have a police camera in every room in America (BTW, a reasonable

The major issue is that bits (even bits recording a true crime) should
be considered actionable ---whether kiddie porn, nazi songs, recipes for
stories of veillless women voting & driving cars by themselves,
In my lil' noggin (not speaking for the Movement (tm)), one cypherpunk
ethic is that sticks and stones (and the occasional govt informer) will
break your bones,
but bits will never hurt you.  A post-internet
corollary is that somewhere someone will offend you, and you need
to get used to it.  (Those of us who have allowed ourselves to
