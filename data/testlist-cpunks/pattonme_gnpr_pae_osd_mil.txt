@_subject: kernal timezone options 
I'm not having much luck figuring out what values exist for the TIMEZONE and
DST kernel options. The default is 0 and 0 which puts my machine off by about
4 hours. The installation routine put in the proper link to US/Eastern or on
another box EST5EDT. This apparently is insufficient to get the date command
to behave. Incorrect time obviously impacts the entire system.
My bios clock is right on. So where are the integers defined that correspond
to the various zoneinfo files? This is definately man page material.
thanks for the continuing assistance.
ps, I figure -1 or -4 is the correct value for DST
