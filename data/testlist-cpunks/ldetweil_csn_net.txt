@_subject: CYPHERPUNKS EXPOSED 
Attn Reporters and Writers!! who are the CYPHERPUNKS?
what are they talking about?
what have they done in the past?
who are the "leaders"?
what do they believe in? what are their *real* goals?
My name is L.Detweiler, and I've made a serious study of the more ulterior aspects of the CYPHERPUNKS for several years, and I invite you to peruse my
findings at the web site below.
I've been quoted in various articles and I'm available for serious interviews
with anyone who wants the REAL STORY BEHIND THE CYPHERPUNKS.
note: be forewarned that key cypherpunks consider me a heretical blasphemer because of the tenacious, unforgiving honesty and zealous antisychophancy by which I have pursued this herculean study.

@_subject: Timmy 
just heard an interesting rumor that Timmy has been blacklisted
from working anywhere here in Colorado as a dangerous anarchist
and/or lunatic revolutionary.
but perhaps he can still work in Silicon Valley if anyone there is
willing to hire a debauched millionaire playboy.  the standards
are different where no one wants to live, I guess. (hmmmm, catch
that recent cool article on CO in National Geographic?)
besides, everyone here in CO would prefer all the
anarchists stay in CA anyway so they can all be taken care of
in one fell swoop with the next "big one".. did I feel
a little "trembling" over there or is it just the standard cpunk
cowardice? (hehehe)

@_subject: Dmitri 
I just pledged $20 for Dmitri's trip and want to publicly
encourage him to attend. Dmitri, I can attest the cpunks and Sandy
are gracious hosts. (lately Dmitri has been sending me mail intermittently
about tcm)
because of the extremely wide interest and "buzz" factor of this activity, I suggest this invitation of
guests with donations be made a semi-regular feature of cpunk meetings, with discussions on the list about future guests.
btw, I have recently tweaked my www site slightly for anyone who
is interested.
oh, and btw, there was a fantastic article on crypto in last week's
newsweek by Steven Levy, I don't recall seeing mention of it here.
it mentioned "crypto anarchy" and the 4 horsemen of the infocalypse.
a very concise yet informative and current article.
