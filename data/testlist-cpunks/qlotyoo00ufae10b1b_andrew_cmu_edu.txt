@_subject: Grubor remailer? (Was Re: Lucifer remailer) 
DHP is "The DataHaven Project", a local (Pittsburgh) ISP "dedicated to
providing anonymous and/or private accounts for users."  The egregious
Law Doctor *could* be running the remailer, but there's no particular
reason to think so.
It might make a nice test case for the Pennsylvania anti-remailer law.
