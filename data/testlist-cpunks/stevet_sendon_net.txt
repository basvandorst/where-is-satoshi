Just recently, I bought the current issue of Wired.  I've not looked at the
magazine much since some time in it's second or third year of publication, and
of course now I remember why.
Anyhow, as I was chuckling at the endless stream of articles and advertisements
telling us how wonderful it will be when we can finally enjoy ballroom
dancing as we fly about between cities and countries in great big dirigibles,
I noticed a single paragraph in one article which brings to mind a question.
On Page 181, Bruce Sterling wrote,
I'd like to know if Mr. Sterling has eaten Mr. May's brain.  I note that I haven't
seen him posting here of late.

That's your business.  I just thought the meme sighting was funny.
I don't quite know what to say to that.  Perhaps collective ennui (or
senility) has set upon most USENET denizens.  Odd that.  Personally, I would
have thought that name-calling would have lost its novelty after a few years.
They should know better.  I recall some of the uproar about the Cypherpunks
moderation experiment.
You're quite correct.  While I haven't had the time to actually read more than
a few messages from those days, it's obvious that the then fresh speculations
have become today's old news.  Now, those with the skills and resources are
busy planning and implementing that which they see will be profitable within
their planning horizons.  Few would be so short-sighted as to talk about their
work when it might hurt their income or revenue potential.  So, we wait for
product releases, legislation initiatives, etc.
Sure.  It looks like most people (myself included) are waiting to see what
happens so they can amend their plans accordingly.  What else is there to do?
Despite the fact that I disagree strongly with wholesale `liquidation', I at
least respect your candour -- and while I'd love to argue this point with you,
that, too, has been done to death.
However, I've at least got an incentive to stay off the welfare rolls.

Perhaps this message would be better directed to the coderpunks list, but I

To correct my ignorance on current cryptography issues, I have been browsing
the archives.  Some time ago, there was quite a bit of talk about the MISTY
algorithm, although I did not chance upon any pointers to an actual
implementation.  Since the character of the messages which I did read seemed
to be (loosely speaking) light-hearted, I cannot decide whether the algorithm
is some sort of `in' joke, or whether it was a cryptographic algorithm which
didn't `cut it' under peer review.
Are there any old-timers who recall the algorithm in question?

... which is something that I've found odd.  Up here in the Great
White North, it's the Queen who is the nominal victim of transgressions of the

the actual victim of a crime to another entity?  Of course, it doesn't change
the nature of the offence but it does provides a flesh-and-blood victim-object
for offences where there would otherwise be none.  Is it merely a
philosophical holdover from a time when the visible head of state was
considered `superhuman'?
Philosophically speaking, what part of common law permits the state (or
its officers) to evade responsibility for harming an appellant as a direct
result of the legal process -- regardless of the eventual finding of guilt, or
as it was in this case, where the state declined to pursue the charge.
That the charge was laid in the first place is another matter entirely.
Certainly an indicator of impropriety on the part of the state prosecutor
who failed to demonstrate the safe use of brain cells, synapses and dendrites.

Until we have intelligent agents which can sift through the morass that is the

How strange.  It's always individuals working within a corporation who should
be culpable for offences committed as a result of its business practices.
Will this not have the effect of divorcing personal responsibility further
from the executive and employees of a company?
Furthermore, might not the `death' of a company in some cases penalise other
companies which depend on the products or services of the `offender' leading
to a reluctance to prosecute the largest and arguably the worst criminals?
At least when the responsible individuals are prosecuted, there is an
opportunity to `clean house' and reform the offending institution, as it

Quoting Ken Brown (k.brown at ccs.bbk.ac.uk):
It doesn't seem reasonable to legitimise the legal fiction of "corporation as
person" at all.  A corporation is really nothing more than the aggregate of
its employees skills and assets (which are already considered to be `owned' by the
corporation as opposed to its principals.)
Which _could_ incentivize the shareholders to pressure the board of directors
to ensure the corporations actions don't result in a loss.  However,
individuals working within a corporation will know that if they cause the
corporation to commit an offence, their personal risk will be less for the
reason that the `corporation' can take the fall for them.
Which incentivizes a new type of piracy.  Install provocateurs in the employ
of a competitor, have them `set-up' the company for a fall.  The law then
convicts and breaks up the company.  End result: you no longer have a
competitor and the true offenders get off with minimal punishment and collect
large deposits in their off-shore accounts.
Who gives a shit about the workers?  Certainly not the governement, and the
major shareholders won't either.
Which justifies what?
Besides, the power of, say, the UAW will ensure that Ford or GM will never be
held culpable for any major offenses.  Same thing goes with Oil companies,
Union Carbides, and the rest.

For many reasons, we have been perusing the archives in order to resolve a
number of burning questions.  One such question revolves around the the
erstwhile entity, Blanc Weber.  Despite much heated discussion on the subject,
a first-order analysis of the archives clearly shows that we may not be
certain on the question of whether or not Blanc wore panties.
Applying the principles of forensic psychiatry to her messages gives hints of
deeply-rooted insecurities which may ultimately be indicative of her
motivation for continually evading all prior queries on this matter.  Since
such things should, purely for the health of the individual, be treated so
that more serious mental illnesses do not arise and fester, we have singled
out this one matter for a current infestigation.
Additionally, the global nature of the Cypherpunk distributed mail lisp is of
such significance that we also feel that this issue should be investigated and
resolved for the betterment of the many people, provocateurs, cats, dogs, and
tentacles who may have spent many sleepless nights worrying over this
question.  We also unhesitatingly observe that this investigation and the
knowledge gained might have the ancillary benefit of advancing Science, and
thus in some small way, enhance the quality of life for the whole of mankind.
This message is, therefore, a call to those with information on this important
matter to come forward.  At this stage, we are interested in first-person
anecdotal accounts concerning Blanc and her panties (or lack thereof) which
would either add to the store of knowledge presently within the Archives, or
which would lend credibility to some of the more outlandish claims concerning
underwear which we, as scientists, must presently exclude from our data
gathering efforts due to lack of corroboration.
Please feel free to send your messages either to the lisp or via private
electronic mail.  We thank you for your assistance and co-operation in this

Then they probably aren't anarchists.
Anarchy won't work unless _everybody_ cooperates in good faith.  And it ain't
gonna happen.  It is more likely that a state of actual anarchy would result
in a minor restructuring of the democratic pattern of two wolves and a sheep
deciding what to have for dinner.
Ideally, intellectual property (or more properly, knowledge) would always be
in the public domain.  For that to be viable, something, perhaps a gift
economy, would have to replace currently competing systems.  And it ain't
gonna happen.  Too many people enjoy not only the simple material benefits of
capitalism (to name one), but more importantly, the power which it gives them
to manipulate their environment to suit their will; and which includes, of
course, people.
Patterns of domination and so forth are obviously far too deeply ingrained in
the human psyche to make viable any meaningful change towards flattening
somewhat bottom-heavy wealth and power hierarchies.

I'll let you know just as soon as I finish ratting out my parents.
Do they have coffee growers selling to the Fair Trade consortium down there?

Quoting Trei, Peter (ptrei at rsasecurity.com):
I wonder why they bother with such polls.  At this time, there is enough
legislation and political will to mandate `more government' involvement in
people's lives without the need for unscientific study.
Not only is there a need for a war to boost the flagging economy, but
obviously the future security of the human race _depends_ on omnipresent
government intrusion in the affairs of man.  What, exactly, is gained by these silly pretences at polling the people for
their opinions when the unassailable logic of military necessity is sufficient
unto itself?  I suggest that journalists explain, in simple terms, the facts
of national security to the public.  Properly presented, the majority will
easily accept the inevitable without complaint since the only other option
will be to abandon facts and logick for chaos and uncertainty.

Doesn't that depend on how quickly they co-operate with the feds?  Surely
highly intelligent citizen-units will be given the opportunity to save their
property from confiscation in exchange for their services towards furthering
the war effort.
