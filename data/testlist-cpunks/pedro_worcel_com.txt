References: When you import the public key it says this:
hidden at dot.onion ("born on January 31 1979 .. all prime numbers .. I would
sit on the floor in my bedroom and just count.")
My guess is that you need those three primes (1 31 1979?) you can somehow
generate the public key for the hidden service where the mail address is. I
tried to determine how onion addresses are generated but unfortunately I am
a noob and I couldn't do it.
