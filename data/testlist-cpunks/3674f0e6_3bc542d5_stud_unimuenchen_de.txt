@_subject: German government press release on Wassenaar 
I think that without looking at any official texts this is very clear from the motivation of the Wassenaar effort: They don't want strong crypto ever to be used by common people. So they can't allow
128-bit crypto for free export in any case. Quite misleading, at
least in my opinion, is their use of the word 'public domain' software, which most people understand to be software which anyone can download free of charge.
BTW, does anyone have an idea of how long would it take before
the clauses of Wassenaar become effective in the countries concerned?
It can't be intstantly effective, can it? (Laws have to be officially
