@_subject: [liberationtech] HP SEC Disclosure on Area SpA and ZTE 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission posted the October 2012
response of HP to a request for information on exports to sanctioned
countries -- worth the short read; within, the company discloses that its
equipment was transshipped through partners, rather than direct sales, to
the Italian company Area SpA in the well-publicized Syrian monitoring
center project. It also hints at the aggressiveness with which the US
government (Commerce's BIS) is pursuing Chinese manufacturers known to sell
equipment to Iran -- which it appears to dodge.

Dear Ms. Blye:
This letter supplements our October 9, 2012 response (the bResponse
Letterb) to your letter dated September 6, 2012 with regard to the
above-referenced filing made by Hewlett-Packard Company (bHPb).
            Pursuant to 17 C.F.R. B'200.83, we are requesting confidential
treatment for this letter. *We request that this letter be maintained in
confidence, not be made part of any public record and not be disclosed to
any person as it contains confidential information. In the event that the
Staff receives a request for access to this letter, whether pursuant to the
Freedom of Information Act or otherwise, we respectfully request that we be
notified immediately so that we may further substantiate this request for
confidential treatment*. Please address any notification of a request for
access to such information to the undersigned with a copy to General
Counsel, Hewlett-Packard Company, 3000 Hanover Street, MS 1050, Palo Alto,
California 94304.
            Comment 1 of your letter cited news reports alleging that HP
equipment was sold by Area SpA (bAreab) into Syria.  As noted in the
Response Letter, HP has confirmed that Area was required under the terms of
its contract with HP to comply with all applicable export laws and was
specifically prohibited from selling HPbs products into embargoed or
sanctioned countries.  *HP has also determined that Area did not procure
the HP products believed to have been sold into Syria from HP but instead
procured those products from an HP partner that was not informed of the
ultimate destination for those products.*
*Comment 2 of your letter sought information about whether HP had received
any communications from the U.S. Department of Commerce relating to ZTE
Corporation and/or Beijing 8-Star International Company and, if so, the
current status of any resultant proceedings.*  As noted in the Response
Letter, HP has been contacted by the Bureau of Industry and Security of the
U.S. Department of Commerce (the bBISb) relating to ZTE Corporation and
Beijing 8-Star International Company and has had several discussions with,
and provided documents to, the BIS.
Please contact me at (650) 857-3059 if you have any questions about this
Very truly yours,
   /s/  David K. Ritenour

@_subject: [liberationtech] Why Bluecoat? 
As someone that would probably be within that subset of people singling out
Blue Coat, I would perhaps go as far as saying that the company is targeted
because it is relatively easy. Citizen Lab, Telecomix and others were able
to locate the devices because they had the sorts of signatures, tagging
and predictable configuration ports that clearly malicious devices would
not have. However, despite that they are not
single-use surreptitious listening devices, the company had so clearly
failed in any due diligence in manner that creates a broader debate that
also applies to the Ciscos, Fortinets, et al of the world.
If one were to tell me how to detect ZTE or Huawei kit on a network, you
would essentially be dictating my time and attention for the next month. By
all means, please.
Until then, at least Blue Coat provides the opportunity to educate
policy-makers on what should be done, case in point the civil society
comment to State asking this very question:
Comments to the comment are very welcome, had I realized it was publicly
posted, I would have shared it with Libtech earlier.

etc). - Collin
Most internet users would like to be anonymous online at least
occasionally, but many think it is not possible to be completely anonymous
online. New findings in a national survey show:
   - 86% of internet users have taken steps online to remove or mask their
   digital footprints—ranging from clearing cookies to encrypting their email,
   from avoiding using their name to using virtual networks that mask their
   internet protocol (IP) address.
   - 55% of internet users have taken steps to avoid observation by
   specific people, organizations, or the government
   - Still, 59% of internet users do not believe it is possible to be
   completely anonymous online, while 37% of them believe it is possible.
A section of the survey looking at various security-related issues finds
that notable numbers of internet users say they have experienced problems
because others stole their personal information or otherwise took advantage
of their visibility online—including hijacked email and social media
accounts, stolen information such as Social Security numbers or credit card
information, stalking or harassment, loss of reputation, or victimization
by scammers.
   - 21% of internet users have had an email or social networking account
   compromised or taken over by someone else without permission.
   - 13% of internet users have experienced trouble in a relationship
   between them and a family member or a friend because of something the user
   posted online.
   - 12% of internet users have been stalked or harassed online.
   - 11% of internet users have had important personal information stolen
   such as their Social Security Number, credit card, or bank account
   information.
   - 6% of internet users have been the victim of an online scam and lost
   money.
   - 6% of internet users have had their reputation damaged because of
   something that happened online.
   - 4% of internet users have been led into physical danger because of
   something that happened online.
   - 1% of internet users have lost a job opportunity or educational
   opportunity because of something they posted online or someone posted about
   them.
Some 68% of internet users believe current laws are not good enough in
protecting people’s privacy online and 24% believe current laws provide
reasonable protections.
Most internet users know that key pieces of personal information about them
are available online—such as photos and videos of them, their email
addresses, birth dates, phone numbers, home addresses, and the groups to
which they belong. And growing numbers of internet users (50%) say they are
worried about the amount of personal information about them that is
online—a figure that has jumped from 33% who expressed such worry in 2009.
People would like control over their information, saying in many cases it
is very important to them that only they or the people they authorize
should be given access to such things as the content of their emails, the
people to whom they are sending emails, the place where they are when they
are online, and the content of the files they download.
