I ran this script on the current consensus. The full results (the
nodes-sniff-summary file) are below my signature. How did you compile
the country-codes to IPs list? That wasn't produced by the script.
It's comforting that this approach yields quickly diminishing returns.
Going from 25 to 60 networks only gets you a 10% increase in networks
surveillance (if I'm reading the output correctly), and returns plateau
entirely at that point (I'm considering about two percent to be in the
noise, which may not be appropriate to this domain).
Also, it's not immediately clear whether eavesdropping those networks
would actually get you strong enough correlation to accurately
de-anonymize users[1]. If our rodent(?) friend(s?) could comment on
this, I'd appreciate their expertise.
I also think that if it were possible for "unsophisticated law
enforcement" to deanonymize Tor users, they would already do it. If I
remember correctly, the Tor project gets a lot of requests from law
enforcement to deanonymize Tor users for them, which indicates that they
can't do it themselves (Andrew Lewman would be able to say if I'm
correct or not). I've also never heard of a conviction obtained through the use of this
material, though sophisticated TLAs might not much care. I wonder what a
search through the email dumps leaked by Anonymous in the past year for
Tor would yield. If this attack were possible in the wild, I'd expect
one or more of those contractors to be using it.

Not much actual information, but it's nifty that bitcoin-mining malware
is maybe using Tor hidden services for command and control.

So from what it seems, the malware included a bitcoin miner that perhaps is
to report found blocks / sub-hashes (? is that a term; i.e. if it works in
a mining pool) to a server, perhaps this site in question.

In both cases, the very simplistic security measure raises the cost of
an attack out of the reach of a large class of attackers.
Using Bitcoin without Tor and generating a new address for each
transaction probably protects you against:
      * any moderately-skilled 14 year old
      * local law enforcement
      * your ISP
And several other classes of attacker below the level of, say, the FBI.
TAILS is just a system that forces all connections over Tor. There are
ways to force only specific applications to use Tor that the FBX can use
pretty easily. Since the FBX will write the FBX bitcoin client package,
it can configure bitcoin to, by default, only use Tor.
This isn't hard to do, and since this cheap measure puts Bitcoin out of
the reach of Dan Kaminsky, I'm not very worried about claims of
bitcoin's anonymity.
For reference, it's really, really, really hard to take web browsing and
make it anonymous. Forcing every connection from browsers to go through
Tor won't help you anywhere near as much as it does for Bitcoin. Bitcoin
has already done 99% of the hard work building a protocol that is
totally (as far as either of us can tell) anonymous if it's _just_
tunneled through Tor without any other filtering.

This particular script that is currently being hyped up on Reddit as
"de-anonymizing most Tor hidden servers" simply makes too many
assumptions to be feasible.
Yes, this sort of attack is feasible in principle, and this script will
probably work if you find a hidden service that is also a relay and is
also a publicly reachable HTTP server, but saying it can be carried out
against most hidden services is simply false as a matter of fact.
Hidden services don't need to be reachable from the Internet. They don't
need to have accurate clocks. And as a result, a lot of them aren't
vulnerable to a program on the Internet that is being marketed as
reliably de-anonymizing hidden services.
To summarize:
      * This is not a novel attack
      * This particular variant of the attack ("clockskewer") is not
        effective against many if not most hidden services
      * The people claiming it does on Reddit are scare-mongering Tor
        for karma, and that irritates me as someone who likes Tor and
        wants people who need more-secure systems to research Tor and
        see the stable, well-tested tool that it is, rather than hype
        from Reddit.

In a similar sense, Google could break this list, by censoring it on

Any infrastructure provider can break any company or organization that

All of the most recently leaked documents pertaining to Tor (from 2007

congratulatory for Tor, and most of the fears of the research community
(correlation attacks in particular) are as yet unrealized.
As coderman says, there are a wide variety of lucrative active attacks
that the NSA is not shy about using. Given these attacks, there's no
reason to try to become a global passive adversary or implement
correlation attacks. You don't need a correlation attack if you've owned
your target's computing platform with a 0day or several.
To respond to another comment of yours:
Virtually all academic computer science in the United States is
government-funded; Tor isn't substantially different.
Further, the Tor developers include people whom the US Government is
openly hostile towards (Jacob Applebaum), and are generally very
principled people. What is your source for the "fact that the american government has
influenced and bribed virtually everybody in the security community"?

I think that if you are uncomfortable with taking direct action to
liberate scientific knowledge, you can still be a valuable participant
in this broader movement, using tactics and strategies like the one
you've described.
However, I feel that it's wrong to condemn those who are willing to take
those risks, and betray whatever institutions give them privilege.
If we want any movement to grow, we need to be ready to accept a diverse
range of tactics from comrades that we may or may not agree with on
questions of specific actions, but that we must support writ large,
since they are fighting the same battle we are, and we would ask the
same of them.
So to conclude: you've presented a good idea, and I will support you if
you are persecuted for using it, as long as you recognize that those who
publish things as the open access guerilla cookbook are trying to
achieve the same goals as you, and you support their work towards those

Are any of these humanly realistic? The people working at the NSA are
the heroes of their own stories. Do you think they tell any of these
stories to themselves?
I think it's most likely that:
      * It's always safer from a managerial perspective to have more
        data than less, because
      * if there's ever *really* an attack, and you didn't have the
        data, you'd be fucked, both from a personal standpoint (you, the
        NSA manager, would know that people died because of you) and
        from a career standpoint (shit flows downhill).
      * The people who run these systems are selected, not primarily,
        but in large part for, patriotism and loyalty. They think
        America is maybe flawed, but still the greatest country in the
        world, the last bastion of freedom and free enterprise and
        McDonald's and apple pie. They care about keeping it safe, and
        there's some amount of mission creep that's inevitable.
This is actually a much worse situation than any of the storybook
villians you've sketched out. It's not universal (LOVEINT is a thing

This is almost certainly not the case. DPR posted his personal email

bitcoin. There are plenty of companies that are trying to do the same,
so they can make money.
But we're neither bitcoin-related nonprofits, or bitcoin-related
startups. This is the cypherpunks list. Legitimacy shouldn't be our
I think it's sad that so many people had no better option (indeed, the
Silk Road was usually the best option for finding substances that
weren't dangerously adulterated) than to send their money to a man who
did violent things, and supported other people that did violent and
utterly reprehensible things. I also think it's sad that this particular man is almost certainly going
to have a shit life from now on.
I also think this adds nothing to any argument over Bitcoin, because
again, he got caught by being dumb. Bitcoin+Tor still seems pretty
ironclad as a hosting platform for illegal activities.

The "slip" in this case is that the services were hacked. Tor (neither
TOR, nor ToR) wasn't compromised.
Notice that without tools like Tor, organized cybercriminals have been
doing things like hosting child pornography for decades now. They do it
with tradecraft and occasionally botnets. What does that say about this
thread of argument (predicating the "legitimacy" of bitcoin on its
ability to be compromised)?

The hitmen were the extortionists. This is roughly how the exchange went
according to the FBI complaint out of NY:
      * extortionist: Give me 500k.
      * DPR: Why?
      * E: I owe people money.
      * DPR: Put them on the line.
      * People to whom the extortionist owes money (TOTALLY NOT THE
        EXTORTIONIST'S OTHER EMAIL ADDRESS NO WAY THATS CRAZY TALK):
        Hello.
      * DPR: Kill the extortionist.
      * D: That'll be 150k.
      * DPR: I've had people killed for 80k. But sure.
      * D: Okay, transfer bitcoins to this address.
      * DPR: Here you are.
      * D: Have a nice day!
The point of the "murder solicitation" is for DPR to indicate that he's
willing and able to have people whacked if they piss him off too much.
Then the extortionist and DPR both get to solve their mutual problems
without losing face.

The Wired articles mention that the FBI and the operator "struggled for
control of the servers" by changing passwords on each other.
You're ignoring the fact that once a server is exploited, it's an
unbounded road from there to actionable, convictable evidence. Suppose
the Freedom Hosting operator only ever logged in via SSH over another
hidden service endpoint. How would the FBI find him? What if the servers
they compromised were VMs with traffic forced through Tor? What if they
were some other crazy configuration dreamed up by someone hosting a
hidden service hosting service?
For DPR, we know he got lazy, and more than that, that he was extremely
sloppy. I'd bet that the Freedom Hosting guy was a similar situation.
There are plenty of illegal *websites* that haven't been busted yet.

GNUnet over RetroShare. GNUnet does f2f and p2p, and is developed by

References: <5350E1BD.5010304
OCaml.      1. OCaml is more obscure than many languages, but it supports
        programming in imperative, object-oriented, and functional
        styles (though it's obviously best suited for a functional
        style). I've seen people write Java in OCaml and produce clean,
        modular code.
     2. OCaml is used in industrial environments (it's gotten pretty
        popular on Wall Street) and in open-source projects; the
        toolchain is mature and the community is vibrant.      3. OCaml is memory safe, but more importantly, it's type safe, and
        its type system is capable of encoding a great deal of your
        program's correctness. It will take some time to get your
        program to compile, but when it does you have a much stronger
        assurance that your program is correct than you do in C, C++, or
        Java.
     4. OCaml compiles to native code; I'm not sure if deterministic
        builds have been done but they should be possible.      5. (Performance, the hidden elephant in every language discussion
        room) The OCaml team takes security seriously, and OCaml is
        performance-competitive with C. OCaml does tail-call
        elimination, so you can write programs functionally that are
        memory-efficient.
     6. (Weaknesses) OCaml has a global lock due to its garbage
        collection, so parallel programming has to be done with
        processes. This is (IMO) cleaner than in similar situations like
        Python, but is obviously suboptimal. I'd highly recommend reading through this blog series, chronicling a
developer picking OCaml as the language to rewrite a large Python
open-source project in. It doesn't have the same focus as you, but it
goes over various reasons why someone might switch to OCaml, and
introduces some OCaml features:

It's definitely a privilege to be able to do this. In the United States,
the animal liberation activism community (among others) is rightly
paranoid of infiltrators and state repression. There's a certain level
of paranoia that's culturally accepted as necessary "security culture".
This might involve using pseudonyms, but obviously not very secure ones,
because this organization happens primarily in meatspace.
This dovetails nicely with the somewhat nomadic lifestyles of the people
involved, and the self-determinist ethic from the punk scene that's so
wedded to this group of cultures. It's common for people to introduce
themselves with obviously psuedonymous names like "carrot" or "scout",
but these people might even use these names on a personal basis with
people who know their legal names.
This comes back to the threat model -- these activists are scared of at
most an FBI investigation, and at baseline local police keeping tabs on
them. Weak pseudonyms are expensive enough for local police to keep the
community afloat. Likewise, I doubt it would have been very dangerous for adrelanos'
partners or close friends to know their activities as a Whonix
maintainer. Probably a hyperinvestigation leveraging the full powers of
the surveillance states of the world would have penetrated this layer of
psuedonymity, but I doubt this would ever have happened.
It would have been interesting to see how far this could have progressed
along a spectrum from complete psuedonymity to complete ...nymity. How
long would adrelanos have been psychologically capable of keeping up the
act if a single friend had known?

Were this the first time I had seen something like this on the list I
would not have spoken up about it.
But this list is rapidly degenerating into being a general conspiracy
theory forum rather than a cypherpunk forum. This should be a collective and conscious decision, rather than
something induced by a minority of active posters.

Someone with a little knowledge of R/similar could visualize the decay
of cpunks much better than this, but here are some people who wrote
code/built things/were real cypherpunks, versus fucking Mr. "Autism and
Racial Strength" (first post 7/3/2014) over here with this thread and
Juan "You're just an agent of the American Fascists" Garofalo (first
post 9/09/2013)  with the follow-through:
 * Cathal Garvey (last post 10/16/2015)
 * Eugen Leitl (last post 10/26/2015)
 * Peter Gutmann (seems to only troll now, but still posts)
 * James A. Donald (last post 01/24/2016)
 * John Young still posts, but substantially less
And now we're left with the above two concern trolls and company who
never even sent email to al-qaeda.net.
It's an abject falsehood that raising the noise to totally drown out
any signal and alienating the entire rest of the list is somehow not
harmful to the list. Nobody who A.) has no concrete contribution to the community and/or B.)
never posted to al-qaeda.net has any business posting more than, say,
John Young. This isn't censorship, this is the continuity of the
community. Just because you CAN spam cpunks with autism and racial
strength doesn't mean it's necessarily cypherpunk to do so. Maybe submit to /r/DarkFuturology, guys? You'd probably get more

Somewhat confusing threading here Cari.
I see a few possibilities as to what I could do here:
      * Be vigilant in calling out patriarchal, racist, and generally
        neoliberal or fascist ideas promoted by some of the more recent
        arrivals.
              * This would provided a benchmark on the list indicating
                that these ideas are not generally accepted.
              * This would also require me to argue with assholes on the
                Internet. As the say goes, pigs, mud, etc..
      * Filter these people out and try to maintain productive on-topic
        discussion.
              * This would be of limited usefulness since people who I
                generally find to be quality contributors continue to
                respond to the Stormfront-esque crowd.
      * Filter the whole list, comb through it periodically to see if
        there is any useful signal, and call out the most egregious
        offenses I can find.
              * This is what I've chosen to do since it is optimal from
                my time perspective.
I think this list is a lost cause at this point. Ever since around the
time it became more discoverable after the switch from al-qaeda.net to
cpunks.org, and some possibly overzealous cross-posting, the discourse
has shifted from actual cypherpunkery to white men complaining about
having their privilege eroded on other mailing lists. There are a number
of quality contributors that no longer post here, reducing the signal
and allowing more noise. I can't bring them back. But I can at least
remind anyone more moderate listening that the cypherpunks list wasn't
always a far-right discussion group, which I think is the reverence due
to the community that used to exist.
I'd appreciate any suggestions, onlist or offline, from anyone who
thinks similarly of the ideological drift of this list from generally
anti-authoritarian to crypto-white nationalism.

Hey Steve,
I've never posted much to CPunks, preferring to listen when people who
now no longer post such as Peter Gutmann, John Young, Eugen Leitl,
Cathal Garvey, Griffen Boyce, and others. My first post to the cpunks
list that I've archived was in early 2010, in a discussion of Mozilla
Perspectives. That was back when the CPunks list discussed things of
that nature, rather than "racial strength," which is assuredly
crypto-white nationalism (in the "attempting to disguise" sense, not in
the "cryptographically secure" sense).
Most of the people I name above no longer post. I notice the first post
I see from you is from 2014, which might indicate you missed this period
of the cpunks list. You might want to read some of the archives from the
previous five years, rather than limiting yourself to the last six
months. This list used to be quite good and contained reasoned
discussion of a variety of technical topics. As for ideology, I use my real name on this list because I'm already
openly anarchist and cypherpunk in my meatspace identity and see no
reason to hide this. However, you seem confused on the nature of
anarchism. As a rejection of all forms of coercion and hierarchy,
anarchism is both implicitly and explicitly feminist, anti-racist,
anti-capitalist, and anti-imperialist. If you're still confused about
this, I suggest "Said the pot to the kettle: Feminism for anarchist
men." It's very basic, but if you find it too basic you can look at the
recommended further readings for more advanced topics. If you do
consider yourself an anarchist, I urge you to meditate on why you chose
to embrace anarchism as an ideology, and whether those reasons also
compel you to embrace feminism and anti-racism as explicitly as
anarchism. If you're a "libertarian," I urge you to stop using a word that
everywhere but the united states means "anarchist" in the sense I have
been using it and in the sense anarchists throughout history have used
it including but not limited to Emma Goldman, Assata Shakur, and Bill
Haywood, and instead say "neo-feudalist" which is perhaps more
appropriate. Cypherpunk technology always appealed to me as an anarchist because it
equalizes all people against those who would attempt to oppress them.
Technology does have the capacity to be liberating. But for that ideal
to be realized, the communities around those technologies need be at
best ideologically neutral. If a black liberationist, who should be the
ally of any anarchist, came on this list today, I'm sure she would be
dissuaded from using any actually secure technology because the tone of
this list has shifted from discussing cypherpunk technology, to "racial
strength" and arguing over whether people should have the "free speech"
right to build fascism. The only way this can happen is if people like you look inside yourself
and decide what side you're on.

In an effort to re-seed discussion about cypherpunk topics I'll be
reposting old threads from the cypherpunks list in a rough "this day in
cpunks" effort. In this mail, John Young analyzes the subclasses of "the internet" as a
user might see. Optional discussion questions:
      * How has this dichotomy survived the intervening half-decade?
      * Taxonomies sometimes afford conception of novel categories; the
        original periodic table was mostly empty, not-filled with
        elements yet to be discovered. What internets can we conceive of
        that do not presently exist?

I'm a little skeptical of wireless mesh networks as a general solution
to this sort of problem, because they're inherently chatty, and have
very limited reach.
I think a better solution is local wired networks with something like
Freenet running over them providing distributed censorship-proof
storage. The next challenge is to synchronize contents between local
Freenet darknets over sneakernet, which I don't think has been done.

You're totally correct, but the people who actually do control this list have decided it's more important for the obvious CyberCom trolls to drive the list into the ground than it is to violate their concept of ~freedom of speech~. It really sucks that the list has been fucked over by some people who are at worst being paid to do so by a government (a possibility I've become convinced is near to the truth), or at best just assholes who didn't even have the balls to post on the al-qaeda.net version (of course, signatures indicate they were trolling the debian lists during that period).
Every ecosystem attracts parasites, and the best kept gardens die by pacifism. People whom this post/subthread is about: how many people have to say they dislike your posts and killfile your email before you take the hint and stop posting? You are not contributing anything of value, and you aren't liked in this community. If this list was a party, you'd be having your circlejerk in the corner, or screaming alone, while literally everyone else ignored you. Try to feel, just for a second, the shame, isolation, and sense of social ineptitude I'm sure you have at plenty of times in your life if not most of it. That is how you should feel wherever you post to this list.
