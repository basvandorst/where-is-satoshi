 The Onslaught Against American Liberties Escalates
 The US Justice Department is currently suing radio station KWTX in
 Texas over what they term "malicious disregard for the truth  in
 reporting on Waco".  If convicted the station will be both civilly
 and criminally liable for any alleged harm caused to property or
 government agents.
 This is of course ironic.  In a sea of federal propaganda, and
 self-serving FBI-ATF press releases, the small radio and TV stations
 (and the Internet) were the Only source of real information about
 what actually happened at Waco.
 Even before this case has been heard the judge revealed his bias by
 stating that he thought the conduct of the station was "outrageous."
