@_subject: HyperAccess for Windows 2.0 advertises RSA encryption 
Recently received an offer from Hilgraeve, producer of HyperAccess
for Windows 2.0. (800) 826-2760
I quote the brochure "Enjoy easier, safer, more secure file transfers
with amazing Hyperprotocol enhancements: Autostart, Smart Crash Recovery,
and RSA Encryption"
"Exchange files containing sensitive data through public data channels
(local phone lines, long distance carriers, cellular, or wireless) with
complete confidence, using state-of-the-art RSA encryption."
Any comments on what they are up to?
This is the same company who sent my
friend the previous version of the package and told her fer sure fer sure
it had full 3270 emulation, but turned out to be a VT100 session with some
keyboard remapping to simulate PFkeys. She had to call them twice for her 60
day guaranteed refund.

@_subject: Low power/bandwidth machines 
If you have access to a SLIP line, but frustrated with perhaps less of
a machine than you would like, give MINUET a try.
It is a DOS based tool designed for students with cheap/old computers
so they can access the Internet. It includes embedded POPmail,
news, ftp, telnet, ping etc.
It is available anonymous FTP from
   /pub/pc/minuet/beta16/minuarc.exe
or /pub/pc/minuet/shaky/minuarc.exe  <--beta17
SLIP software that goes with it is at
The beta17 has caused no problems for me yet. Beta17 has some
performance advantages. A 386 should be no problem at all.

@_subject: Fundies: The last word on this subject (please) 
*This is the last reponse to a former crypto thread gone bad*
*Please post your flames to me, not the list. Thank you.*
Once upon a time, I said:
On Wed, 16 Nov 1994 17:52:14 -0600 (CST) you said:
Duh. What about the other millions of participants. Did you have relatives
living and participating in Nazi Germany? I did. They were some of the most
sadistic invasive individuals you could ever imagine. They were Lutherans.
Can you say, "Papieren, bitte?".
Let's see that's  C -> ((I & P & F) v (I v P v F)), a conditional disjunctive.
Not very convincing really, not to mention downright mean spirited. Perhaps
your argument would be more compelling if it had anything to do with
crypto/privacy issues. See you later and thanks for the bait.
Let me guess, you're not a pre-1600 Native American. You should read some
real interesting accounts of just how tolerant the largely Christian settlers
were of the native population of North America. Statement after statement and
plea after plea were made to stay out of their lives and to give them the
privacy to live as they wished. Try reading "The Long Bitter Trail: Andrew
Jackson and the Indians" by Anthony F.C. Wallace or "The World Turned Upside
Down: Indian Voices from Early America by Colin G. Calloway.
You might be saying to yourself, "Hey, I remember that differently from
history back in school". That's true. It's interesting to find out what
a farce the written history interpretations in this country are on some
matters. Historians had their agendas and interpretations too. Try reading
"Historians Against History" and "The Free and the Unfree: A New History
of the United States" by David S. Noble. These works point out the
importance of primary material in recording history, and may cause oneself
to be more cautious about positing historical "facts".
Now let's get back to talking about how we are going to insure our liberty
through encryption and all that it implies.

@_subject: HTML browser/editor for MS Word 6.0 
Bill Gates demonstrated an HTML browser/editor for MS Word 6.0. It is
called Internet Assistant. It just entered beta testing, and will be
available under the "What's New" heading of the Microsoft Home Page by
the end of December, and later it will come with the 32-bit version of
Word for WIN95. It will also include a viewer which will "display any
Word document distributed across a network."
I've read that the PGP code is not highly modular, but this is just one
more indication of an OLE document centric universal editor based loosely on
Word. I could eventually see their mail product calling most of the same
code. Has anyone considered OLE compliant PGP encrypter/decrypter objects
that would act on the contents of the document? A tool on this platform
could be the most rapid path to widespread use of encryption. Almost
everyone is able to use Word, and it comes bundled with a *lot* of new
computers. And if it is OLE compliant, it can drop inside of your favorite
OLE aware application.

@_subject: MIME based remailing commands 
IMHO, an ideal message would have the ability to handle nested objects
of varying types, MIME is only a start. To construct a unique format
for remail_messages is reasonable, perhaps even preferable. But of
course, MIME *could* be a start, in a brown'n'serve roll sort of way.
However, with a proprietary approach,
what to use for delimiters, or quasi-parentheses (in the case of n
layers of nesting, encrypted or unencrypted) needs extensive and
careful consideration. This is the same dilemma many developers face
with document-centric interfaces and their plethora of odd-bird formats.
I say take the remail stuff out of the header altogether,
MIME or not.

@_subject: West (was:HR830 - Anyone tracking this?) 
Well, the West citation system *is* proprietary, without a doubt.
This is a case where ease-of-use has completely dominated. Court
records are completely laced with West citations.
The Tax Analyst lawsuit: destined to fail from the start.
If they want to do this they will have to come up with their own
indexing/citation system, and then get everyone to adapt to it.
About as likely as putting 73v AC wiring in every home in America.

@_subject: Remailer-on-a-CD 
OK, let's ponder the minimum hardware necessary,
possible minimal configuration (Intel/clone based):
(1) Case.
(2) Power supply.
(3) Motherboard/CPU and 4mb RAM.
(4) Hard drive w/ controller.
(5) modem card.
(5) No monitor, keyboard, floppy, or video card.
   (a) would require some "umbilical cord" connection to initially
       set up from another PC.
   (b) need to operate on "umbilical", direct and uucp modes.
I am just thinking out loud here, but the hardware could be damn
cheap (sub $500). You can find old 386 boards with 4mb right on
the board (no SIMMs) for next to nothing (the decreasing popularity
of 30-pin SIMMs makes this a surplus store reality, as nobody
wants to bother to strip out the RAM chips anymore).
I have also seen an ad by the KILA company in Boulder, CO who
advertise some sort of compact pc-on-a-card deal, that might
be applicable.

@_subject: IRS to keep unreviewable secret dossiers on US citizens 
Excerpts from : St Paul Pioneer Press, Jan 29, 1995
"IRS plans to collect more data on individuals to nab tax cheats"
a "vast expansion of secret computer database of information it
keeps on virtually all Americans" will include "credit reports,
news stories, tips from informants,  and real estate, motor vehicle
and child support records, plus conventional Govt financial data"
"Any individual who has business and/or financial activities can
expect upgraded agency reports to be put to IRS auditors promptly"
Here's the kicker: "Although agency officials concede that some of
the data collected will be inaccurate, taxpayers will not be allowed
to review or correct it"                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
So much for the FOIA.

perry at imsi.com says:
I should add that later in the article it suggests the scenario of
select information from the database being used in an audit, and
you would be able to contest the specific information they use
against you, but you would not be able to view any of the raw data.
                     ^^^^^^^^^
It sounds like this amounts to "we don't have the info until we use
it against you".

@_subject: "Subway" remailers 
Need ideas/comments:
I have been modeling remailer scenarios using IBM VM/ESA virtual
machines. After fwaffing a bit, looking at the traffic analysis
concern, and taking note of some of the probability work posted
recently, I thought I might throw this idea out for a sanity check:
"Subway" remailers.
"Subway" remailers would exchange identical sized "containers", much
like a subway at semi-regular pulses or intervals. It would require
a ring of remailers large enough (yeah, I know) to make traffic analysis
of entrance and exit points difficult and/or expensive.
Each container would contain either fixed or variable slots for
multiple messages. Containers could be full, partially full, or
even empty. (there would probably have to be a max message size)
Subway remailers would be able to carry a message to a designated
"last" remailer or to deliver blindly to a "last" remailer of
random choosing.
Messages may or may not change containers at the various
stations/remailers. It could be randomized.
Possible header scripts:
X-Subway-Script: Ride 2; Latent: 03:30; Ride 3; Deliver;
or many other possibilities.
The whole container would be encrypted to the next remailer,
giving the next remailer the same access to exchange passengers
or to make them wait in a latent state.
The quirkier matters on this are how to handle PGP so that
nothing is compromised and for how the remailers to identify
each other as "friendly and operational" so the subway system
does not have a traffic jam.
Crypto comments please.

@_subject: "Subway" remailers 
Hmmm...  think of an egg carton, filled with anywhere between zero and
twelve eggs. Each egg has its own itinerary as to how many stops it
wants to make at other remailers, and whether it wants to change
cartons. The eggs would be entire messages, and could "get off" at
any particular stop, or at a random stop (based on # of rides(hops?)).
The entire carton would be encrypted from one stop to the next.
I would anticipate that the single-message architecture of the cpunk
remailer would be retained, and that "riding the subway" would be an
optional feature. Of course with "passenger" exchange and waiting
you essentially get the mixmaster effect, except you are blind to
the actual pathway. (remember the MX-missle system, which planned on
moving ICBMs from launch site to launch site in an underground matrix
of tunnels?) The only thing you would see from the outside is regular
pulses of large cargo-carrying (or not) message containers. It might
be a partial cover-traffic solution as well, though you still have to
worry about entering and exiting the subway system, it's just that it
somewhat breaks the identifiable direct traffic-trace links.
An even more advanced feature could allow an individual to submit
an entire container (loaded with different messages) to the subway
system (although this may give an attacker clues about any weakness
in randomizing pathways internal to the system, for users utilizing
default features). Imagine only submitting one or two messages a
day that delivered twenty-five. That might really furrow a traffic
analyst's brow. More or less that extends the subway paradigm
outside the ring of the system, at least partially, I would guess.
I am unsure if there is an existing term for this, but how about
"composite mail" containing "aggregate messages"?
