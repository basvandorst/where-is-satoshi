@_subject: How to clear sign messages with PGP (FAQ) 
No, I just use this MS-DOS batch file called sign.bat:
pgp -sta +clearsig=on %1
The %1 expands to the first argument on the command line.  To sign a text
file called toscott.txt, I just give the command
sign toscott.txt
When you get a message signed like that, you should be able to verify the
signature by simply executing pgp on the file you get (provided you have my
key -- it is on the key servers, available by finger mpj at csn.org or
mpjohnso at nyx.cs.du.edu, ftp://csn.org/mpj/mpj4.asc, or on my BBS
pgp frommpj.txt
For more pgp tricks, see the FAQ ftp://netcom.com/gbe/ (echoed on
ftp://csn.org/mpj/public/pgp/) or on the Colorado Catacombs BBS.
