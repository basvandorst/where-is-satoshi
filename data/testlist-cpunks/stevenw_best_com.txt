I used to work for a company that made frequency-hopping military radios.
It's a catch-me-if-you-can game, a bit like the amusement arcade toy where
stuffed rats pop up through holes and you try to whack them with rubber
hammers. You can sure *see* where the next one is, but you can't get there
fast enough to make contact. If you knew the pseudo-random pattern, you
could anticipate and be there every time.
Thus in a frequency-hopping radio you can push the retuning (read RF
phase-locked loop) technology to its limit and build transmitters and
receivers around them. These typically hop in the order of 100 times a
second. The adversary has to find the uncorrelated signal very quickly
indeed *and* have PLL technology at least as good as yours to recover
anything from it. Finding the signal generally means listening to all
frequencies at once, requiring huge amounts of hardware parallelism and/or
realtime computing power. Once you throw ten or so radios onto the same
band, it's no longer any use looking for the strongest signal, making that
approach useless.
The primary reason for FH is not to hide information, however. Encryption
can be used for that. It's to prevent the enemy from hiding the information
from the intended recipient through jamming. Radio jammers work by simply
drowning out all other traffic so that the receivers either clip and
distort everything or have to attentuate the input signal so far that the
interesting stuff is undetectable. Like trying to have an intellectual
conversation at a bad rock concert. By employing FH you require the enemy
to have enormous and impractical jamming capacity. There are FH radars too.

It covers the history of computing and comparing machines from the early

tubes, microfilm, punched optical tape, mechanical integrators, etc. There
is a fair amount of crypto relevance as it passes through WWII and the
cracking of cyphers becomes important. It's also a tale of overly-ambitious

@_subject: RISKS: Informed public opinion of automatic toll collection 
Anonymity and privacy interest:
Public resistance to electronic road-use taxes is continually to grow
worldwide.  Most recently, a panel of 14 laymen assembled by Teknologi
Naevnet (i.e., The Danish Board of Technology, Antonigade 4, DK-1106,
Denmark, +45 33 32 05 03 -- see report number 5/1995), having been presented
with arguments pro and con concerning "intelligent traffic" technologies,
concluded that it "does not see any substantial economic, environmental or
safety benefits from massive public investments in traffic informatics --
perhaps with the exception of public transport".  On the issue of safety,
for example, they accepted that some likely safety benefits existed, but
that they had to be weighed against other potential dangers, for example
that drivers' skills may deteriorate due to reliance on automation, and in
any event they concluded that if safety should be improved then much more
cost-effective measures were available anyway.  They also raised concerns
about privacy and emphasized that new legislation would have to regulate the
new databases that such systems would accumulate.
The report fits an emerging global pattern.  When electronic road tolls and
other forms of high technology that entail surveillance of citizens'
movements are implemented quietly, creating a fait accompli, citizens tend
to accept them fatalistically.  But when any sort of democratic procedure is
employed, public resistance is very stiff indeed.  This phenomenon suggests
two possible scenarios for the future:
 (1) Continued stealth implementation, leading to deepening public distrust
     of information technology and the organizations that control it.
 (2) Genuine public involvement in the social choices being made about
     "intelligent" roadway technologies, leading to legitimate decisions
     based on full public debate, and potentially as well to technological
     improvements (such as the use of digital cash and other technologies
     of anonymity) that deliver a broad range of functionality while
     responding appropriately to legitimate public concerns.
Which scenario occurs will depend on the political culture of each country.
More concretely, it will depend on the degree to which people are informed
about the issues, express their concerns, and ensure that the more legitimate
course is taken.

On FPGAs:
Probably not necessary. Simulators do just fine. And the FPGAs themselves
top out at 50 to 80 MHz.
Easy to access. They are everywhere. The EPROMs are about $6 each and are
serial. You could build a programmer at home.
While there are OTP FPGAs out there (typocally Altera), many are in-circuit
programmable *any* number of times since they use SRAM internally  not
EPROM cells to program the configuration. The latest twist on FPGAs is to
add more RAM internally and have them reprogram themselves on the fly,
hundreds of thousands of times a second. This cuts the logic requirements
down for desidhns that don't need all of the logic all of the time.
True, but $400 is probably not far low.
My employer uses FPGAs in all new designs for production. They are *very*
common for products that sell into the thousands per year. Mask-programmed
gate arrays have the major disadvantage of very long lead times, usually a
more pressing requirement than saving $30 per board over several thousand
Companies now make boards that contain just FPGAs wired in a grid. They are
sold as general-purpose logic engines with software to implement circuits
as hardware simulations. I'm sure that these would do just fine, though
they are costly.

Some thoughts on the rash of IPG OTP cluelessness:
If I set up a radioactive source, I can almost certainly get 1000 bits per
second of random data from it. Chop it up into 5 second chunks and sell em.
That's 5000 bits without all that messy rotor stuff.
Why throw out 30% - 50% of the OTPs? Any filtering algorithm will reduce
the randomness of the resulting numbers. My guess is that the "hardware"
randomness generator has very little entropy and a) produces numbers with a
bell curve distribution, so concentrating what little entrpy there is, and
b) *repeats* a whole lot of the time. That's what they throw out.
They know that encryption has something to do with prime numbers so they
throw in a little obfuscation with the rotor thing. Why bother?
And of course, since they supply all the locks and all the keys, they can
search for, locate, and read anybody's communication whenever they want.

Since the char array is allocated on the stack as an auto, its contents are

Oh, and don't forget that main() returns an integer. This will generate at

It may well return a random number or something that will be interpreted as

@_subject: RISKS: Pachinko card counterfeiting update 
I would like to add some background as someone who has played in pachinko
parlors in Japan.  (The origin of the game of pachinko is rather vague.
Some say it is based on the ball game popular after the WW-II in U.S.A..
Anyway, it is a gambling business.)
The card in question acts as a kind of debit card inside the pachinko
parlors.  It was introduced a few years ago by an former police official,
with the expressed intention of keeping the money flow easy to track. (I
would say it was a ruse to make a few companies where the ex-police
officials can find jobs after retirement from the office. But I digress.)
The cards are sold to the pachinko parlors and the customers buy the cards
from the parlors, and obtain steel balls to play the game by inserting the
card into the slot next to the game machine.
Pachinko gambling works as follows.  When you win the game, the number of
steel balls in your possession increases and the customer can exchange the
balls with gifts.  (Therein lies a complication. Japanese law prohibits
gambling, and so exchanging the steel balls with real money is illegal.
*However*, first exchanging the balls with gifts, and then exchanging the
gifts with money at a third party outlet [which is quite likely to be
operated by the parlor owner] has been allowed by the police.) Speaking of
loophole! Some people do bring back the gifts to homes: depending on the
places, parlors carry game-boy cartridges, latest bestseller books, snack
food such as cookies, instant noodles, umbrella, purse, movie video tape,
music CD, to name a few as gifts. But if the customer wants to exchange
his/her win indirectly to money at the outlet, then he/she has to ask for
special gifts used essentially as money tokens by these establishments.
These are often a tiny gold/silver foil embedded in thin plastic slab, etc..
Each parlor/outlet pair uses different stuff. In my hometown, a special
brand of silk stocking was used as money token. This whole thing is a farce
in view of the anti-gambling law in Japan.)
Back to the card: the cards in question are used by two leading card
manufacturers. (There are another couple of late-entry companies whose cards
are not known to be attacked yet.) The card is based on the design done by
NTT Data.  NTT is the Japanese equivalent of old Ma Bell in the USA.  NTT
Data is a company that specializes in computer software integration,
communication and such.  I believe it designs the telephone card (debit card
used for pay-phone in Japan), too.
The pachinko card is the size of name card and plastic.  The details are not
published. To the best of my knowledge, I think there is a magnetic strip
that contains the card ID information such as its serial number and the
amount of debit money.
There were 10,000 yen, 5,000 yen, 3,000 yen, 2,000 yen, and 1,000 yen cards.
(I said "were" because 10,000 yen and 5,000 yen cards are no longer
Attack method:
pachinko game machine was so primitive to defy rational explanation: each
time the card was used, a tiny hole was punched to indicate the amount left
in the card. As the customer uses the card, the position of the punched hole
on card shifts toward the zero position. Once there is a hole on the zero
position, the card is no longer usable.
The first simple attack as far as I can tell was to fill in the hole in the
card with tiny plastic (essentially the chaff produced when the hole is
punched was used to fill in the hole).  I am not sure if such simple attack
was possible, but it seemed possible really at the beginning with crude
modification of the magnetic data.
Then, of course, the magnetic information on the card was also modified in
more sophisticated ways when the card was used.
However, the bad people also learned and somebody stole the reader mechanism
and figure out the part of the magnetically-coded information: the result
was that bad people could buy the pristine 10,000 yen card and then uses up
to 2500 yen of the debit amount legally and then "re-fill" the card to 9500
yen worth, thus gaining 2000 yen for free again and again.  (Until 3000 yen
was used from the 10,000 yen card, the physical hole was not produced on the
card, and only the magnetic information was changed. Hence the mere
counterfeiting of the magnetic information was necessary to "revive" the
card. No physical re-filling of the card was necessary. Physically
re-filling the hole is easy to spot visually and was avoided by the bad
[I have to confess that the exact amount involved in the counterfeiting
is a little uncertain. But the general idea still holds.]
Similar attack was possible with 5,000 yen card.
Presumably the gain by attacking 3,000 yen, 2,000 yen and 1,000 yen card was
small compared with the risk, the bad guys didn't attack these cards until
Now the situation is that of cats and mouse.  New counterfeiting
methods and counter-measures follow each other in rapid succession.
I believe that the cloning of the card was also done. But I don't know the
Now, the card companies and pachinko parlors stopped issuing 10,000 yen and
5,000 yen cards because the damage was so large.
Also, they have installed special readers to verify the validity of the card
by incorporating more vigourous checking not available on the readers next
to the game machine: it used to be that the cards sold could by used by any
pachinko parlors in Japan. Now cards sold elsewhere have to be verified with
this machine before used at a local game parlor. Cards sold at the local
parlor can be used without such checking.
Already, there are reports of counterfeit-card usage:
 - either the cards are so sophisticated that they can pass the enhanced
   reader.
 - Or the bad guys buy the cards locally and then use some of the
   debit amount and then bring the cards to their factory to re-fill
   and re-use it at the local store again and again.
The card companies have installed countermeasures in selected stores to the
cloning of the card by checking the serial number of the card and stopped
the operation of the whole game machines in the store if a card with the
serial number of the previously used (finished?) card is ever inserted into
the game machine.
Another simple method of fooling the reader was also reported about a month
ago. Essentially, it cuts out a long strip of the 3,000 yen card (now the
most expensive card after 10,000 yen and 5,000 yen card are gone) and
rotates the strip to invert its direction and then reassembles the card
again using cement or something. To my surprise, it was reported to be
deemed valid by some readers (!?). Apparently some readers only check for
the position of the hole on fixed position and fooled to believe the card is
valid if the hole is not in the expected position, etc.. Once not so
rigorous readers are distributed, it is very difficult to upgrade all of
them in Japan, I guess.
The problem is complicated in that the counterfeiting only damages the card
company. The parlors report the amount of debit money used in their shops
and then compensated for the amount (less the small surcharge by the card
company.)  This means that every time the counterfeit card is used the card
company alone loses money and the local parlor doesn't lose.
There have already been reports of the owners of the pachinko parlors
involved in the usage of the counterfeit cards.  These bad owners allowed
the bad guys to use the counterfeit cards in their parlors and pass the used
debit amount to the card company and getting compensated.
In these cases, the bad guys bring back the money (by simply exchanging the
phony debit money into the steel balls, and then without playing (they can
play if they wish), exchange the steel balls to the special gifts, and then
exchange the gifts with money. [Usually, buying the steel balls and then
exchanging them with gifts, and subsequently with money leaves you less
money than you started with. The house always wins. In this case, the bad
guys started out with counterfeit debit money and ends up with real money,
so it is OK for the bad guys.] The parlor also gets the money for the used
debit money. So they win, too.  Only the card companies lose.
Counterfeiting probably has existed since the first money (or equivalent)
was ever invented.  But, it surprised me that NTT Data approached the whole
scheme so naively, especially since there have been reports of telephone
card counterfeiting in Japan before.  Some of the counterfeiting methods
reported seemed so simple, and I have a doubt whether NTT Data was serious
enough to deter counterfeiting.
At least, I can safely say they have underestimated the ingenuity of the
counterfeiters badly and didn't learn from the counterfeiting of telephone
cards very well.

SEOUL, South Korea (Jun 15, 1996 00:41 a.m. EDT) -- For a Canadian
university student, creating an Internet site on North Korea was simply
opening a small library on the  reclusive nation. For South Korean
authorities, it was threat to national security.
Last week, South Korea declared David Burgess' World Wide Web site
subversive and ordered 14 local computer networks with Internet links to
block public access to it.
The government also said it would punish anyone accessing North Korean web
sites, taking its ideological war with its Marxist enemy into cyberspace.

  Event Information, Speakers, and Agenda
   On July 1, 1996 in the heart of California's Silicon Valley, members
   of Congress and prominent computer industry leaders and privacy
   advocates will meet to discuss the need to reform U.S. encryption
   policy.
   Encryption technologies, the "locks and keys" of the Information Age,
   are an essential component of a secure and trusted Global Information
   Infrastructure. Every day, millions of dollars in commercial
   transactions and the private communications of individuals traverse
   the global network. All are vulnerable to the prying eyes of
   industrial spies, hackers, and rogue foreign governments.
   Computer users need strong encryption technology to protect themselves
   online, and U.S. businesses need the ability to export strong
   encryption in order to build a secure Global Information
   Infrastructure.
   Yet current U.S. export controls and other limits on encryption
   technology are limiting the widespread availability of strong,
   easy-to-use privacy and security products. As a result, these policies
   are stifling the growth of electronic commerce, preventing computer
   users from protecting their privacy, and handicapping U.S. industry in
   the global marketplace. Until these cold war barriers are removed, the
   full potential of the Internet and the future of electronic commerce
   will never be realized.
   National and local press are encouraged to attend this high profile
   event. For more information, please contact Danielle Kolb or Alan
   Davidson at the Center for Democracy and Technology, +1 202 637 9800.

Maybe it wasn't made clear that all the pictures have been postprocessed
with an experimental version of PGP* to optically anonymize them, thus
protecting the identies of both the innocent and the guilty without bias.
Software problems triggered by Eric's neckware prevented the anonymizing
process from working properly in his case. Sources tell me that PRZ himself
was in many of the pictures, very nicely rendered as a classic marble and
rought-iron fireplace.

In the mid-eighties in the UK they adopted the idea of a red triangle
continuously displayed on the screen of movies shown on TV that were
considered to have more than the normal share of wobbly pink bits, airborne
blood, etc.
Viewing figures for obscure 70's French movies shown at 1:30am soared as
all the horny geeks sat through two hours of forest/eating/traffic or
whatever scenes waiting for the 7 seconds of nudity.
I'm sure that far more children saw these movies than would have without
the government sponsored red flag with the words "Get It Here" being waved
like crazy as the movie rolled.

I haven't bothered reading this particular thread up until now, but in my
opinion, based on this drivel, you're getting dangerously close to being
certified officially by the Cabal as an ignorant kook.
Of course it does. However, to maintain community resposibility must also
Hogwash. That's community again. As respect and care for my neighbor's
peace and quiet I lose the freedom to blow leaves on a Sunday morning. This
is independent of what the law says.
Hogwash again. Law and law enforcement only exists due to the failing of
such societies. Prisons and executions are the ultimate failure of a
society. Their existence (like hierarchical structure) is not a given. But
if it is all you know, then of course it's what you assume.
And don't forget that it is fundamental that law and law enforcement also
protects predators from citizens. Your analysis is rather one-sided.
How so?
It's industry being?
True, but there are individuals before community.
Wait a minute. A large number of people living in a utopian paradise?
Surely this is ideal. If there were the crime and activity you describe,
then it would not be utopian and would not be paradise. But maybe this is
paradise, but only to a criminal.
And interesting that you use the world "still". You obviously equate
"unorganized" with "backward". You even say "rural". You a city boy by any
Excuse me, can someone remind me why we're all here please?
You said it. You fail to understand. The reasons are obvious. Your eyes are
closed, your mind is shut, and you can hardly be heard over the traffic.
Freedom for whom? Freedom, like technology, is neutral. Laws are always of
the form "You shall" or "You shall not". Laws against mugging (to protect
the citizens) do not prevent muggings. They restrict the freedoms of
muggers and eventually incarcarate them. The existence of muggers causes
people to restrict their own freedom, by not jogging at night etc. Mugging
is a social and a community failure. A "good" law against the activity
reduces overall freedom while simultaneously failing to address the
problem. In short, a simple, ineffective, but visible fix. A perfect
business for politicians to be in.
Sure. It means that the community can continue life as normal without
realising that the Mayor is gay. She does a fabulous job, everyone gains,
the community is very secure. Or shall we throw some FUD into the equation,
tell everyone, and have the uproar wreck the community?
Facts are neutral too. It does not depend on the message.
You really have laws on the brain, don't you? Lets see. Breaking laws
reduces freedom? This is where you have the wrong end of the stick. Making,
not breaking laws reduces freedom. If our mayor friend above looks at 1
naked minor a week, how does this reduce the freedom of her community? What
about 100? Much less free obviously.
Does that personal security extend to encrypting your hard drive? What
makes you different from Ms. Mayor?
But ignorance plays a big role :-)

@_subject: More snake oil: ENIGMA 
Seen on usenet. I'm not currently subscibing to the list, so I hope it's
not old news.
Can You KEEP a SECRET?
Doctor? Lawyer? Accountant? Executive? Or even Politician? -- you know
there is some information your clients don't want to fall into public
hands. Can you
keep a secret? They want you to. Let's face it, you want to keep some
things a secret as much as they do!
Now you can. Now there is an unbreakable version of ENIGMA which is so
easy to use that a child can send messages the CIA can't break.
Perhaps you remember the original version of ENIGMA used so successfully
by the Germans during World War II. Hundreds of cryptologists worked for
thousands of
hours to unscramble the secret orders being flashed openly over the air
waves by the Germans. In the end, allies cracked the code only by
stealing one of the machines.
With ULTRA ENIGMA 2.0 stealing the machine won't do your enemies any
good at all. First, the New ENIGMA is a thousand times more complex. Yet
it only takes a matter of minutes for you to lock up whole directories
of your secret files securely. Then your secrets are safe. They are
secure, Now and Forever.
Your secrets are safe because there is no place for cryptologists to
begin, no way they can tell which part of the code is part of the secret
and which part is garbage, no way of telling if the file is long, or
short, or a drawing, or a picture, and it might even be in a foreign
language for all they know. Yes, the new ENIGMA really can encode
drawings, pictures, X-Rays and absolutely anything else you can put into
a computer. Can You keep a Secret? With ENIGMA you can... ENIGMA is so
secure that not even the producers can crack your secrets open.
ENIGMA is seamless. Nobody can crack the codes you set but you. Now
that's a Secret you can tell everybody! Your clients will be glad to
hear it, and you'll
sleep better knowing it is true.
Let us spill out the Secret Details of ENIGMA for you to examine. Take
just a moment to glance through our pages. We'll show you how it works,
and explain why it works. Then,
especially for Governments and other high risk situations,, we reveal
why even the weak link, (knowing the encoder) can be eliminated with a
Fortune Cookie blindly selected from a randomly available jar with
thousands of cookies shuffled back and forth at the company. Think about
it;, if YOU don't pick the keys, how can ANYONE guess which keys You
Pick? And we are sorry, but NO... the company won't have any idea which
keys you pick either..! -- Think of it this way, some things are best
kept a secret between you and you. As an added bonus, we'll also show
you some other professional ways you can guard your secrets.
