@_subject: Elliptic Curve Y**2 = x**3 + a * x**2 + b 
I can't remember the elliptic curve system well, but if the parameters
of the curve are not standard for everyone (which I am afraid they are)
one method is to pick the point first, then solve for the a & b.
If this is not the case, finding the square root may be nice or tricky.
if p=3 mod 4, then the sqrt is
X^(P+1) mod P, where X is the number you are trying to find the sqrt
of.  It can be extended to X=5(mod 8) and a few others, but I'm not sure
how.  There is also a form for X=1 mod 4,but I can't find reference to
it. Hope this helps

I'll have to let somebody else answer this one, since I am really not
As far as anybody knows, you're right, exponentiation is a one way
function in a prime field.  However, there are some things to be said. If you're using a fixed g and
N, or repeat both for too many key exchanges, if anybody logged them, it
becomes a more exciting target, since the hard part of the algorithms
need be completed only once.  Then taking separate logs with the same g
and N is easy.
The field used in DH is just a standard Galois Field mod some large
prime.
