@_subject: Future Development on Hidden Services 
Hash: SHA1
Hi list,
as some of you may know, there have been several improvements to hidden
services lately. First, hidden services publish their descriptors to a
distributed directory [1] consisting of currently 71 nodes. Second,
hidden services may require client authorization already during
connection establishment to block unauthorized requests as early as
possible [2]. Third, hidden service performance has been improved with
respect to advertising and accessing hidden services [3,4].
Certainly, there are still things that can (and should) be improved.
This is an attempt to compile a good list of future development tasks on
hidden services. Comments are most welcome. If there are other things
with hidden services that need improvement, please let us know.
