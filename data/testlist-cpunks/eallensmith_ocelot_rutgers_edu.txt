   _ Tuesday December 12 6:33 AM EST _
V-One Unveils Internet Security Technology
   ROCKVILLE, Md. (Reuter) - V-One Corp. says it has introduced security
   technology called SmartGate that enables companies to build a secure
   system to conduct transactions on the Internet computer network.
   SmartGate is transaction-based software that uses encryption to ensure
   protection over an open network, the privately held company said
   Monday.
   Encryption scrambles the data and in the SmartGate system, a key to
   decode the data is generated that is unique to a specific transaction
   session.
   V-One, which stands for Virtual Open Network Environment, said
   SmartGate is available now directly from the Rockville, Md.-based
   company.
   It said SmartGate can be purchased in either a hardware-software or
   software-only form. The SmartGate server retails for $9,995 and the
   software-only version is $4,995. A server is computer that manages the
   flow of data in a network. SmartGate licenses are priced at $79, with
   reductions offered for volume purchases.

for my domain name (goldenbear.com) are going to do anything about the
current bouncing-messages phenomenon anytime soon, so I'm looking into other
ways to get & send E-mail (e.g., more persistent than this address which
will disappear when I'm done with school in ~ 6 months). I've found a few
services which may be of interest to C-punks because they're useful for
creating/maintaining persistent cyberspace identities with no necessary
connection to a "real name".
netbox.com (  ) provides web pages and E-mail storage
or forwarding for people; they let you sign up for a trial month for free.
They ask for name/address/phone (which could easily be a Mailboxes Etc
address and a voicemail from Mailboxes Etc or whatever) and accept payment
by check or credit card. They'll store incoming email or forward it to
another account. They'll do header rewriting (similar to the anonymous
remailers) so that outgoing mail looks like it came from this address.
       There's one problem with this in regards to the "no necessary
connection," and that 's the governmental requirement for mail forwarding. MBE
and any legal other one will want to see at least two forms of ID including one
photo, and have a form that they fill out using that and send to the local
post office. Anyone have a way around this problem?

@_subject: e-mail forwarding, for-pay remailers 
The PO's primary interest is making sure you don't mind if they don't
forward your mail once you stop using the Commercial Mail Receiving Agent
(CMRA) and secondarily that you aren't committing fraud by using the mailbox,
sending people change-of-address notices, ripping off your creditors, and
skipping town.  California has a hopelessly dishonest law that just went
into effect in 1995, which pretends to be designed to protect consumers from
fraud by the 7 million small businesses in CA that uses mailboxes,
and actually requires that _anybody_, business or not, who wants to rent
a mailbox must fill out the Post Office form and also appoint the PO or CMRA
as their agent for service of process and give them up-to-date True Addresses.
The PO, meanwhile, "usually wants" a California Driver's License plus another ID
to rent a box from them.  (I didn't have such a thing when I last rented a box,
and the PO hassled my mailbox company into asking for one when the new law
came out.)  After many attempts at calling the PO to get anybody
who knows the _official_ rules for what ID is required, I found a PO lawyer who told me the rules are in the "Domestic Mail Manual", which any
Postmaster has, so my next step is to look up one of those before I next get
a mailbox.
So maybe a random photo ID will work, such as your FooBar Consulting
Employee ID, and maybe it won't, depending on what state you live in and how
clueless your local Post Office bureaucrats are.
MBE/whatever _think_ the rules are. When I last got a box (under my real name,
in case anyone's wondering), I seem to recall that they'd accept credit cards.
Once one has one box under a given name, this opens up the possibility of
getting a secured credit card to make future access easier. However, I believe
that they do want at least one form of photo ID; I can't remember just off what
their specifications were.

Authorities Patrolling Cyberspace for Crime
   WASHINGTON (Reuter) - Crime on the Internet is now more than just
   dirty pictures.
   With millions of people and a fast-growing commercial presence in
   cyberspace, federal law enforcement authorities are struggling to
   crack down on wrongdoing in the new territory.
   They are hunting for bogus get-rich-quick schemes, weight-loss
   miracles, AIDS cures, credit-repair programs, investment scams and
   gambling. That's in addition to crimes such as trafficking in child
   pornography.
   ``The scams are the same. The way you investigate them is different,''
   said Lucy Morris, assistant director for credit practices at the
   Federal Trade Commission, which has staff attorneys monitoring the
   Internet.
   Just as they would on the street, these ``cybercops'' act on tips or
   they just patrol. The potential crime scenes are the Internet
   worldwide computer network, computer online services such as America
   Online and smaller computer bulletin boards.
   Cruising cyberspace as part of their work are employees with the FTC,
   the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of
   Transportation, the Secret Service, state attorneys general and state
   securities regulators.
   They can work at the office or from home.
   ``In some respects it's easier to find the violations because you
   don't have to leave the office,'' said Minnesota Deputy Attorney
   General Tom Pursell.
   But there are obstacles.
   Cyberspace offers criminals wonderful anonymity and law officers face
   ambiguous jurisdiction issues due to the global nature of the
   Internet, raising questions about whether new laws are needed to cope
   with the new medium.
   ``Now all you need is a computer, a telephone, a little bit of
   software, and you're in business,'' said Hubert Humphrey III, the
   attorney general of Minnesota who himself prowls cyberspace in search
   of wrongdoing.
   Authorities agree they have their work cut out. ``It's going to be
   very difficult,'' predicted Humphrey, whose state has been out front
   in tracking down wrongdoing.

   _ Friday December 29 5:51 AM EST _
Dole, Gingrich Unhappy with Telecom Bill
   WASHINGTON (Reuter) - Top House and Senate Republican leaders
   expressed unhappiness Thursday with a proposed rewrite of the nation's
   communications laws amid signs the Republicans may seek changes in
   legislation circulating on Capitol Hill.
   ``There are a number of problems in the bill that could have been
   resolved in a different way,'' Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole told
   a news conference.
   The Kansas Republican, appearing with House Speaker Newt Gingrich,
   said there are ``three, or four, or five provisions'' GOP leaders
   ought to focus on, including what he described as a ``giveway'' of a
   key part of the airwaves to broadcasters.
   The plan worked out by congressional negotiators proposes that in the
   future, when the government doles out licenses for high-definition
   digital TV, the Federal Communications Commission ``should'' limit
   eligibility to existing broadcasters.
   Critics have charged this would amount to a multibillion dollar
   giveaway of the airwaves to the broadcast industry and that the
   government could instead raise as much as $70 billion through a
   competitive auction of the digital spectrum.
   Last week it appeared the White House and congressional leaders had
   reached agreement on legislation to overhaul the 61-year-old
   communications laws, following weeks of work by House and Senate
   negotiators.
   The plan would tear down decades-old laws and permit telephone, cable
   and broadcast companies to invade each other's turf.
   But after Vice President Al Gore and some congressional leaders said
   they had achieved an accord, other Republicans began to balk at the
   proposal, saying no deal had been struck.
   The protests scuttled any chance the telecommunications bill would be
   completed this year.
   Among other things, Republicans expressed dissatisfaction with
   provisions to ease restrictions on the number of TV stations
   broadcasters could own, saying the plan did not go far enough.
   They also cited issues such as regulation of the Internet and a
   decision to drop language permitting greater foreign investment in
   telecommunications.

anyone has or knows of an archive of the earlier list messages on the subject
(before I subscribed), I would like to read over them.
        Although I am unfortunately not completely familiar with this phrase,
I believe that your meaning here may be that I may be too much of an idealist. My position is that I will not use a digital cash system with the significant deficits in privacy that the ecash system has. The only exception to this
stance would be if it becomes plain that it is the only alternative to a
credit card system.
        Admittedly, as has been pointed out to me in private email, some
degree of increased privacy in the ecash system can be gotten via
changing currencies using ecash. An example would be dollars to yen
through one changer and back again through another. However, I will not
regard a digital cash system as truly good until it has the following
        A. Private to any combination except all three of bank, sender, and
        B. The bank does not know the amount transacted or owned, unless it
is the sender or receiver. (Obviously, it will know the total amount of
digital cash of its issuance in existence, and how much it has received from
or sent to each person, but it should not need to know anything more).
        C. Double spending is detectable, but does not reveal the identity
of the individual. Thus, the bank does not need to know the identity of
the individual when issuing the digital cash.
        The following are desirable but not strictly neccessary
        A. Offline transactions are possible. To detect double spending, a
transaction with the bank will probably be necessary, but this should
ideally be postponable until the goods purchased are shipped.
        B. Mathematical as opposed to computational authentication and
privacy. Since I am neither a mathematician nor a programmer, I am
uncertain about whether this last is possible. I have my doubts.

   He said the authenticity of the images as well as patient
   confidentiality must be protected.
   "We have to make sure that the digital information and images are not
   altered accidentally or surreptitiously," Wong said. "In addition,
   x-rays and other imaging studies are part of the patient's medical
   record and must be protected from unauthorized access."
   The system uses mathematical formulas or codes to scramble the images
   through encryption. It involves a "two-key" system -- one code enables
   public access but a second, private code is required to unscramble the
   information.
   The private code, known only to the individual to whom the information
   is transmitted, is 1,024 computer bits long, Wong said.
   In emergencies where fast transmission is needed, the unscrambled
   image is transmitted with a digital "fingerprint," a smaller code that
   assures the intended viewer that no one has altered the original
   image.
   Wong prepared his report for the annual meeting of the Radiological
   Society of North America.

Not if you're encrypting a Credit Card transaction to ship physical goods.  In that case, I'm going to certainly want to link a key ID to a physical body (or at least address) if I'm the seller, so as to limit liability as best I can.
While this might not ultimately be important, early adopters of crypto on the net seem in general to be financially interested with an eye to limiting liability. They want linked keys.
There's a public-relations aspect to crypto which most systems not linking name -> key id fail.  This is the step necessary to get it out the door.
Unfortunately, it also appears counter to CP philosophy.
However, if you have optional linking of ID and name, shippers will only ship to keys with such attributes. Because just ID and address, it could be a "hit and run" type attack shipped to a safe maildrop.

allegedly "harmful to minors" material. I agree strongly with their position.

        Adds two new defenses: 1) the use of labeling or segregating
systems to restrict access to online materials, such as systems
developed using the standards designed by the Platform for Internet
Content Selection project (PICS), and 2) the use of other systems that
serve the same function of the other defenses if they are as reasonable,
effective, and appropriate as blocking, adult access code, and labeling
technologies; and
        Protects providers or users of interactive computer services,
information content providers, and access software providers from civil
or criminal liability under state law for making available to minors materials
that are indecent or harmful to minors if they take actions to qualify for
the defenses mentioned above.

MIT's World Wide Web Consortium to develop an easy-to-use content

selectively control online content they receive through personal

   _ Monday April 1 2:32 PM EST _
U.S. Traders Play Political Futures In Cyberspace
   CHICAGO - As primaries in the American Midwest confirmed Senate
   Majority Leader Bob Dole's clean sweep, a Wall Street trader logged
   into the Internet on his home computer and made one last trade before
   going to bed.
   These political futures contracts are not available at the huge,
   traditional exchanges that trade billions of dollars per day. Instead,
   the contracts are on the 24-hour Iowa Electronic Markets (IEM), which
   trades several thousand dollars per day.
   The IEM, setup in 1988 by the University of Iowa, is a not-for-profit
   political futures market open to traders globally via the Internet,
   under the regulatory scope of the Commodity Futures Trading
   Commission.
   An estimated 5,800 people have registered as IEM members by sending
   checks or money orders to open trading accounts of $5 up to $500 to
   trade various world political markets that also include Austria's
   Vienna City Parliament Election and Canada's British Columbia
   Provincial Elections.
   Collectively, accounts total about $150,000, said Joyce Berg, a
   professor of accounting and director of markets at the University of
   Iowa.
   In that race, IEM payoffs are determined by the candidate who wins the
   majority of popular votes. Contracts in the candidate receiving the
   largest number of popular votes will pay $1 each while all other
   contracts will expire worthless.
   "For those of you with Web access, let me point you to an
   astounding place for us market geeks -- the Iowa Electronic
   Market," one trader wrote in the Option Fool newsletter, written
   and distributed via the Internet.
   "It's a fun market," said Gary Sparks a stock options trader
   at Group One Trading who participated in the market during the last
   presidential election four years ago.
   But some take the IEM seriously because each candidate's contract
   price in cents can be translated into his percentage chance of
   winning.
   And in the past two U.S. presidential races, the IEM has predicted the
   winner with an average 0.2-percent absolute margin for error. That
   compares to the next most accurate Harris poll with a 1.2 percent
   margin of error, according to the Iowa Political Market's data.
   That type of accuracy has caught the eyes of at least a few U.S. stock
   options traders and has earned a weekly spot in a New York Post
   newspaper roundup of presidential polls.
   Jeff Yass of Susquehanna Investment Group said he considers what IEM
   markets are showing when making trading decisions in stocks and
   options. "Clinton and Dole have been in a tighter race (on the
   IEM) than any of the Wall Street analysts have predicted," he
   noted.

self-defense goes up against due process, particularly lethal self defense. One
liberal justification for various bans or limits on lethal self defense (i.e.,
those against potentially lethal defense against property crimes - including
preventing the criminal from making away with his stolen property) is that the

overturning contempt charges, judges are very rarely willing to consider each
other wrong (outside of the realm of appeals), much less sentence each other.
Another instance of how judges tend to resist even the appointed mechanisms for
removal can be found in the recent judicial commentary regarding a threatened
impeachment for another judge; while they were correct in that case, the
instance is instructive. This is a common tendency inside the government in
general; cops are very loyal to one another, even when they're crooked. Seldom
is anyone but an internal body (Internal Affairs) permitted to go after a cop

tolerate this - they tolerate the equally offensive black separatists, after
all...). The Zundelsite reference is incomplete in that it fails to describe

Vancouver weekly paper, on April 11. It may be of interest for the issues
of free speech and Internet access that it deals with. You may, however, find some passages disturbing or offensive; I certainly do.
Nazis on the Net
by Crawford Kilian
The far right has become very visible lately. New groups and movements have
sprung up here, in the US, and in Europe; old groups have revived. They go
under many names: neo-Nazis, Holocaust deniers, racist skinheads, militias,
white nationalists. They often seem to disagree with one another as intensely
as they disagree with the status quo, and their ideology ranges from the
sophisticated to the incoherent.
Psychologically they seem to bear a striking resemblance to many of the North
American communists of the 1930s and 40s. Like the Reds, they see themselves
as the persecuted vanguard of a morally superior group (whites instead of
workers) which unaccountably fails to recognize its own interests.
Politically, though, they are very far indeed from the Reds--all the way over
on the far end of the spectrum. So let's call these groups the
"Ultra-violets," or Ultras for short. Whatever we may think of their views,
they deserve attention as a phenomenon--especially as a phenomenon that tests
other people's genuine commitment to democratic values like freedom of
speech, freedom of the press, and open debate. But the Ultras would be far
less significant if they were not exploiting a technology designed to defend
just those democratic values: the Internet.
The creators of the original Internet --back in the '60s, during the Cold
War--built it to survive multiple nuclear strikes. Even if Soviet H-bombs
vaporized scores of cities and military bases, information would still flow
between surviving computers to sustain a defence and counterattack. Democracy
would withstand nuclear war, even if most of its supporters would not.
Whether democracy can withstand the rigorous application of its own values is
now in question. Designed to be unkillable, today's Internet looks
uncontrollable. We now possess a communications system in which anyone can
say anything to anyone else. People can be obscene, scurrilous,
malevolent--and no one can silence them.
Other nations, democratic and otherwise, are alarmed about the political and
cultural consequences of free Internet discourse. Singapore wants its three
million citizens to live on an "intelligent island" wired into the Net--but
it doesn't want pornography or political dissidence leaking in. China is
equally cool to the idea, given its memories of the fax invasion it suffered
in 1989, when overseas Chinese students bombarded campuses at home with news
and pictures of the Tiananmen Square massacre.
The Ultras pose a complex challenge. They've taken to the Internet eagerly
and effectively. They have their own newsgroups, discussion areas available
to almost anyone with access to the Internet. They also run listservs,
discussions open only to subscribers (and subscribing is usually quite easy).
The Ultras have their own websites, locations holding extensive texts and
graphics which computer users can view and copy onto their own machines.
Along with the pornographers, the Ultras provoke repeated calls for limits on
Net freedom of speech, calls that are sometimes answered: those who supply
the Ultras with Net access often cancel their accounts.
Because their views are so unpopular, the Ultras make themselves a litmus
test for the rest of us: Does freedom of speech mean tolerating racism and
anti-Semitism? And if it does, should we respond with contemptuous silence?
Or should we devote time and energy to detailed rebuttal of Ultra views?
To answer those questions, it helps to know what--and whom--we're talking
about. Look at the live Ultras on the Net and you find few who match the
stereotype of the halfwitted skinhead or the paranoid pretend-soldier of the
For one thing, most are far from illiterate. The texts on Don Black's
Stormfront website, for example, are generally clear and articulate. While I
can't judge his German-language materials, his texts in Spanish are also
well-written. Running a trilingual website reflects a cosmopolitan
outlook--another challenge to stereotype.
Many Ultras try to make an academically documented case for their views. Marc
Lemire of the Digital Freedom BBS in Toronto posts long reviews of books
questioning the Holocaust or documenting the firestorm that destroyed
Dresden. Greg Raven of the Institute for Historical Review (a
Holocaust-denying group in California) says revisionism has no connection
with neo-Nazism, white nationalism, or other Ultra positions: "Historical
revisionism is supposed to be a part of writing history (historiography). As
time passes, we gain new information and new insights, which allow us to
better perceive not only the facts of events but also their context.
Furthermore, the IHR is neither ideological nor political."
For a time last year, Raven offered a link to the home page of the North
Shore News, which carries Doug Collins's columns supporting Holocaust
revisionism and other Ultra positions. When the News discovered the link, it
asked Raven to close it; he promptly did so.
Raven's home page explicitly denies carrying anything racist or hateful and
promises to withdraw anything criticized as such. Nevertheless, Raven doesn't
ask Stormfront to close its links to his own home page. And Stormfront is
avowedly White Nationalist. Based in West Palm Beach, Florida, Stormfront
features Nazi-style Gothic lettering, numerous links to sympathetic groups
elsewhere in the US and Canada, and extensive texts and graphics. According
to Milton John Kleim, Jr., who calls himself "Net Nazi Number One,"
Stormfront "lists just about every important individual and group that should
be noted."
Indeed, the Net itself is the common denominator of the Ultras. They may
disagree with one another, even quarrel bitterly, but they keep the lines of
communication open to one another. That's because without the Net, the Ultras
are scattered and isolated. Marc Lemire describes his own progress in Ontario
(via e-mail, as is the case with most quoted material here):
"On April 1, 1995 I started up Digital Freedom BBS (416) 462-3327.  I also
got two Internet sites and began forging a lot of contacts with likeminded
people on the Internet.  Within four months I had an E-mailing list of around
400+ and contacts with all the Sysops and leaders throughout the United
States and Canada.  We are also working quite closely with European leaders.
We have our address on two Web sites and I post to Usenet almost every day."
Milton Kleim, in Minnesota, has found a similar community forming through the
Net: "All of my comrades and I, none of whom I have ever met face-to-face,
share a unique camaraderie, feeling as though we have been friends for a long
time. Selfless cooperation occurs regularly amongst my comrades for a variety
of endeavors.  This feeling of comradeship is irrespective of national
identity or State borders."
Is the Net a useful means of recruiting sympathizers? "Absolutely," says
Kleim. "There are millions of people who agree with us, but feel isolated and
helpless because they don't know who to contact to network with others who
feel similarly... Usenet, in combination with the Web, offers unparalleled
opportunity for our Movement to get our views and more importantly our facts
across to the general public." He's even created a manual, "Tactics and
Strategy for Usenet," advising Ultras on how to use the medium to attract and
hold sympathetic "newbies." And Lemire says a little publicity goes a long
way: "Digital Freedom has been listed in over 5 different publications in the
Toronto area, which has brought us over 1800 users."
What else do Ultras share besides a sense of camaraderie? Stormfront
currently offers several major documents: three long articles about the US
government's attacks on the Branch Davidians in Waco and on an Ultra family
in Ruby Ridge, Idaho; an article about a Canadian rabbi who wants Net
censorship and another about the Chretien government's "gun grab"
legislation. Other articles deal with racial issues. In one, ex-Klansman
David Duke finds much to admire in the Indian caste system.
Stormfront also offers links to like-minded pages. The Aryan Nations page,
for example, after describing Jews as a "virus," rejects the label of "hate
group": "It is not hate that makes the average White man look upon a mixed
racial couple with a scowl on his face and loathing in his heart. It is not
hate that makes the White housewife throw down the daily jewspaper [sic] in
repulsion and anger after reading of yet another child-molester or rapist
sentenced by corrupt courts to a couple short years in prison or on parole.
It is not hate that makes the White workingman curse over his beer about the
latest boatload of mud-creatures dumped upon our shores to be given job
preference over the White citizens who build this land.* No, it is not hate,
IT'S LOVE."
Other links offer Net surfers access to Resistance Records, producers of
skinhead music; the British National Party; the Independent White Racialists
("Your skin is your uniform."); and a collection of Canadian groups known as
Freedom Site: the Heritage Front, the Canadian Patriots Network, Citizens for
Foreign Aid Reform, and others.
Another recent link is the Pat Buchanan for President home page. Although
Stormfront's Black doesn't consider Buchanan adequately "racialist," he feels
the candidate is worth supporting. Fellow-Ultras like Milton Kleim strongly
disagree, and advocate voting for the "Bolshevik" Bill Clinton instead. This,
they say, will ensure that life will become more rapidly intolerable for
exploited whites, rousing them from their apathy to join the Ultra cause.
Kleim argues: "Boobus Americanus does NOT operate rationally; he has no
opinion, and cannot form an opinion independent of the Jewsmedia. The ONLY
thing that can 'convert' Boobus Americanus is more and more Negro crime, less
and less jobs, greater and greater hardships of all kinds. Joe Sixpack will
do absolutely nothing until the flow of his beer ends. The average American
moron must be FORCED to think, and no amount of racist propaganda concealed
Buchanan-style in patriotic wrappers will make the masses consider 'the
A "White Nationalism FAQ" (frequently asked questions) on Stormfront proposes
creating separate nations for whites and non-whites, to spare whites from
continuing exploitation through racial-preference schemes in hiring,
university admissions, and government contracting. The FAQ's author, using
the Norse-mythology pen name Yggdrasil, suggests ceding land already occupied
by non-whites. Whites-only areas, however, would still welcome Asians. (The
only ones with much to fear, evidently, would be white liberals: "Those who
are guilty of 'integrationism' should do the sensible thing and flee. It will
spare us all a lot of pain.")
Milton Kleim, by contrast, sees a different future: "The United States of
America, the Confederate States of America, Canada, and Quebec would be
unified into one Nation-State, perhaps known as the Aryan Confederation."
Local government would operate with elected officials, "but the present
ridiculous parliamentary game in national politics would be replaced with
frequent referenda for important issues."
Kleim would follow a "live and let live" policy with nations like Japan and
Iraq. "Belligerent actions of those governments violently opposed to us, such
as the criminal State of Israel, or the menace to the world called China,
would be countered with equal force, up to and including total utilization of
America's strategic forces."
The Ultras have suffered everything from jail sentences to e-mailed death
threats, but appear determined to carry on. Critics may damn their
anti-Semitism, mock their paranoia (one Ultra wondered whether Stormfront
were a government-run trap), and dismiss their "facts" as exploded fantasies.
Outsiders may wonder why Ultras are going to so much trouble for "Boobus
Americanus" whites who are mere "sheeple" even if they are, technically,
Aryans. Nevertheless, half a century after the defeat of Nazism, something in
its worldview appeals to them. And just as the Nazis used the new media of
radio and film, their spiritual descendants are using the Net to spread their
The case of Toronto's Ernst Zundel shows how technically hard it is to
suppress that message. Spreading neo-Nazi views is illegal in Germany, so
when Zundel set up his own website recently, the German government tried to
close German Netters off from access to it. Several other Net servers
(computers directly linked to the Internet) promptly established "mirror"
sites that Berlin would find it much more awkward to close off--such as
university campuses. Like the hydra, unpopular propaganda can grow more heads
each time one is cut off.
This is not to say that mirror sites at American and Canadian universities
portend a neo-Nazi trend on campus--only that the logic of free speech means
supporting it especially in the cases of those we may not only oppose but
detest. It also means considering whether Canadian laws against "hate speech"
and "false news" may be intrinsically oppressive, however well-intended.
(Even when such cases fail, the prospect of court action, like "libel chill,"
may keep some people from expressing unpopular views.)
One response strategy, adopted by the Simon Wiesenthal Center, is to promote
an "acceptable use" code for persons and organizations providing Net access.
This amounts to a refusal to take the money of Ultras wanting to purchase
such access. It could also include refusing to provide access to
Ultra-oriented newsgroups like alt-skinheads and alt.revisionism. Such
boycotts may make it harder for Ultras, but only until they set up their own
servers--as they have already done in several cases.
Others echo the German government's desire simply to ban Ultras from the Net
altogether. Twenty years ago, Graham Forst founded the Vancouver Standing
Committee on the Holocaust. Since then the Committee has brought together
survivors of the Holocaust with 40,000 high school students from B.C.,
Washington state, and Alberta--including some of Jim Keegstra's
students.[Until he was fired in the 1980s from his job as a high-school
teacher in Eckville, Alberta, Keegstra had taught anti-Semitism to his
students.] Forst rejects the idea that Holocaust denial deserves the same
right to expression enjoyed by those who debate details of the Holocaust.
"Holocaust denial is not a 'position' of any kind," he says, "but is simply
and unequivocally an expression of anti-Semitism." Forst argues that deniers
are no more exercising "freedom of speech" than they would be if they
disrupted a meeting by speaking in imaginary tongues, or by screaming. "Why,"
he asks, "should such a person be allowed a place at the table?"
In Forst's view, "The Holocaust is denied for one reason only: to cause pain
to those vicitmized by the worst eruption of racial hatred in history, not to
contribute to any free exchange of ideas. Deniers are anti-Semites hiding
behind high principles to sanitize Nazism and prepare for its return; in my
opinion, such a nefarious intention requires the 'discussant' to be quickly
and unceremoniously thrown out of the room." But as experience has shown,
it's impossible to throw anyone permanently off the Internet.
The Ultras, of course, consider all the attacks as just a cost of doing
business--and their business is recruiting. They know their potential
supporters are few and scattered. The Net brings them together, encourages
them, and provides them with a community. Yet they seem to have no program
for acquiring power.
Milton Kleim says: "Since we have no idea what the future holds, there has
been little speculation about what will transpire to bring about an 'Aryan
Confederation.' It will certainly be via 'unconventional' means, but it is
impossible to assume a certain course of action will be followed when
inevitable chaos ensues."
Kleim's strategy for recruitment through Usenet newsgroups is clear and
frank: "Except on 'our' groups, avoid the Race Issue. Side-step it as much as
possible. We don't have the time to defend our stance on this issue against
the comments of hundreds of fools, liars, and degenerates who, spouting the
Jewish line, will slaughter our message with half-truths, slander, and the
ever-used sophistry. Avoid engaging in non-productive debates with enemy
activists. It is often difficult to distinguish between the Enemy's dedicated
lackeys, and the misguided who are merely parroting what the Jewsmedia has
taught them."
Kleim is keenly aware of being monitored: "WARNING: Be aware that EVERYTHING
you post will be seen by the Enemy. All of your posts may be catalogued and
archived for future use by the Enemy, either by self-appointed 'Net police'
like the notorious Ken McVay, or by lurkers from the so-called
'Anti-Defamation League' and the 'Simon Wisenthal Center.'
The above-mentioned McVay is doing a great deal to earn his notoriety among
the Ultras and to keep their community from growing. McVay, a 55-year-old
transplanted American (now holding dual US-Canadian citizenship)lives on
Vancouver Island. He'd been a World War II buff when he was younger, and when
he began to run across Ultra propaganda on the Internet--especially Holocaust
denial--he went back to his books to try to refute the Ultras' version of
Out of the "flame wars" he fought online during the early 1990s emerged the
information equivalent of a gigantic weapons dump: The Nizkor Project.
Created by McVay and his supporters, Nizkor is a Web site that is also an
immense archive. It includes detailed refutations of common Ultra assertions
(for example, that the concentration-camp gas chambers were nothing of the
sort), and much more. McVay has included detailed dossiers on many Ultras,
storing the messages they have sent to various newsgroups over a period of
years. Also included are such documents as the complete judgement in Jim
Keegstra's original hate-crime trial.
The first of Nizkor's goals is to forestall the Ultras' efforts to discredit
democratic government--as they do, for example, in speculating that the
Oklahoma City bombing was actually a US government plot. Second, by tracking
and responding to Ultra posts, Nizkor sustains a documented debate rather
than allowing Ultra assertions to go unchallenged.
The third goal is probably the most important: "To foster a critical frame of
mind which will help to protect the unwary from the deceit of hate
propaganda." Although he once supported the idea of suppressing Ultra
propaganda on the Net, McVay now sees documented argument as the best
response to it.
"It was a gradual change," he says,  "over perhaps a year... and it was
UseNet, and the Internet, that changed my mind. I came to understand that the
key to dealing with insidious racism is through education. Suppression does
not provide a cure,although it may be satisfying for a short time -- all it
serves to do is drive the problem underground."
Graham Forst doesn't agree with McVay's new attitude, but feels Nizkor is the
only practicable way to counter Ultra propaganda. And while McVay is on the
Ultras' side of the free-speech issue, they don't seem especially grateful.
Don Black says he feels "amused and flattered" by the attention he gets from
Nizkor, and Digital Freedom's Marc Lemire says the project helps propagate
his viewpoint.
"McVay does, to a certain degree, advance our cause," Lemire says. "He offers
all our messages on one site. An inquisitive person can log in and read what
we have said over the past years. Which, of course, helps us. I personally
consider McVay as a childish reactionary. In one of the first messages I ever
received from him, he claimed I wear diapers and was an idiot. His
information is generally inaccurate and outdated."
Kleim echoes Lemire's claims and also soft-pedals Nizkor's effect: "Actually,
we consider McVay a nuisance, like the common house fly, rather than a real
problem.  He has done us more good than harm.  Many sympathetic people have
'discovered' us by perusing his archives. * Most people don't care about what
McVay is peddling. Only certain segments of society, Jews, political
agitators of the ultra-left like 'Anti-Racist Action,' and allied groups,
give a hoot about what McVay and his friends are doing."
McVay, in turn, doesn't care what Lemire and Kleim say: "I am not doing this
to change Milton Kleim's mind. I am doing this because millions of people
know next to nothing about the Holocaust, and the ugly racism which denies
it. It is all, sadly, ancient history to most of the population. They are
not, however, indifferent - - they read, they query, and they learn to
determine the truth for themselves."
On the evidence of some posts, not all Ultras are as dedicated to free speech
and legal action as they claim. In "Stormfront-L," a listserv run by Don
Black, a Canadian sympathizer recently proposed a scenario "in which we
assume power democratically, but then keep it. The only problem with this
would be the necessity to combat opposing ideas to prevent an uprising. This
would impinge on our right to 'Free Speech' that we hold so dear."
Another Ultra responded: "Yes, I believe that certain 'rights' that are now
available would probably not be so in a fascist state. However, I am not
interested in preserving 'Free Speech' as it is defined today, I am
interested in preserving the Aryan race."
McVay recently reported an attempt by an Ultra supporter to "mail-bomb" his
Internet server, swamping the computer with unwanted messages. (The
mail-bombing failed and the Ultra lost his own computer account.) He also
argues that Ultras like Ernst Zundel support free speech only when it suits
McVay says he does not intend to abandon his efforts against the Ultras. "Me?
I'm in this for life. These guys offend me deeply. The public needs to
understand that the Internet is borderless and near-indestructible. It is the
one place on earth where you can educate tens of millions --billions, in
years to come -- it is a tool for the racists, yes, but I have seen ample
evidence that it is a far more powerful tool for those dedicated to fighting
Journalists reporting on this issue face an ethical issue also. No doubt such
articles would stir some interest in Ultra organizations and views,
increasing the 200,000-plus Stormfront "hits" (log-ins to its web pages and
files) already counted in the past year. Some may join Ultra groups as a
result. But readers will also look in on Nizkor, which is not exactly
neglected. Last June Nizkor was counting 33 visitors a day but this February
it recorded 532 daily visitors--117,768 hits on its various files in that
month alone.
Neither side is going to go away, and many people are going to continue to
push for the silencing of the Ultras. Some will argue that the best way to
fight them would be to ignore them. They might invoke the German poet
Friedrich von Schiller's famous line: "Mit der Dummheit kampfen Gotter selbst
vergebens." ("Against stupidity, the gods themselves struggle in vain.")
The most dangerous ideas, though, are those that go unchallenged. The Ultras
do everyone a favour, however unwelcome and unasked-for, by questioning the
very premises of democracy and equality. If nothing else, they should make us
reconsider our dependence on hate laws which suppress debate rather than
promote it--and which actually promote Ultra goals by publicizing people like
Ernst Zundel and Jim Keegstra.

executive of the B.C. Civil Liberties Association, says all hate-propaganda
laws should be repealed. "Immigration policies, race relations, the Holocaust

Social Protests in the 1990s: Planning a Response
By Gary A. Allgeyer, M.S.
Captain Allgeyer serves with the Melbourne, Florida, Police
"The Law Enforcement Bulletin is published monthly by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, Ninth and Pennsylvania Ave, N.W.,
Washington, D.C. 20535. Contributors' opinions and statements
should not be considered as an endorsement for any policy, program, or
service by the FBI."
During the 1990s, many communities have witnessed a resurgence in
protests and civil disobedience demonstrations reminiscent of the
civil rights and antiwar movements of earlier decades. Major
issues today include abortion, nuclear proliferation,
environmental protection, service and access rights of the
physically challenged, and continued civil rights concerns. Any
community with product- or service-oriented businesses or
military installations may be targeted for action, either by
local activists or national organizations.
The City of Melbourne, located on the southeast central coast of
Florida, has been the focus of such actions in recent years,
primarily due to the presence of the only   abortion clinic in a
county with almost one-half million residents. In addition, the
clinic's highly outspoken owner makes her home in Melbourne, as
does the leader of Operation Rescue, a national pro-life
organization. These factors have made the city a hotbed for the
abortion issue.
The intensity of pro-life and pro-choice sentiments and the
multitude of proponents on either side required the Melbourne
Police Department (MPD) to meet this challenge head on. Yet,
despite hundreds of arrests, lengthy trials, lawsuits, and
attempts by both sides of the issue to challenge the department's
neutrality and professionalism, the MPD continued to maintain a
positive public image, as demonstrated in television coverage,
press reports, and editorials.
The department has learned a great deal since its first encounter
with activism several years ago. Agency administrators have
identified and established methods to address several issues
common to the protests they faced. In many ways, these issues
represent features typical to most contemporary activist
movements, regardless of where they operate or what causes they
NEW CRUSADERS
For the most part, the general public's perception of social
protests has focused on the fringe--a picture of activists as a
few misguided malcontents driven by extreme viewpoints. Images of
barefooted flower children dressed in tie-dyed shirts and old
jeans usually come to mind.
Protesters today are more likely to arrive at the scene
conservatively dressed, some even wearing designer clothes. They
are committed to a cause, but operate from what would appear to
be a less radical position. Whereas the old school proclaimed to
Middle America, "We're different," the activists of the 1990s
claim, "We are Middle America."
Activism, once the domain of extremists, now is viewed as a valid
form of creating social change. Christian activists, in
particular, come from conservative backgrounds and depend on the
belief that most Americans share their   basic values to build
their ranks and project an image of legitimacy onto their
activities. Protesters who once would have been considered
reactionary now may be seen as courageous proponents of a cause.
This change in public perception creates some particular
challenges for law enforcement.
CHALLENGES TO LAW ENFORCEMENT
Intelligence Gathering:
Florida law allows law enforcement to collect and maintain
intelligence on persons and groups if the surveillance is
conducted with "a reasonable, good faith belief that it will lead
to detection of ongoing or reasonably anticipated criminal
activities"1 (emphasis added). Unfortunately, incidents of past
abuse create a negative public perception of police efforts to
gather intelligence information on activist groups.
Nevertheless, the necessity for intelligence gathering cannot be
over emphasized. To cope successfully with a major incident or a
series of announced protests, the police must collect information
about the leaders and members of the sponsoring group(s). The
Melbourne Police Department assigned a full-time de-tective to
intelligence duties with the advent of large-scale abortion
protests. The detective and the department met the challenge of
intelligence gathering in a very direct way.
Every issue has two sides, and law enforcement can use this fact
to its advantage with regard to activist groups. For the MPD,
much of the intelligence information gained on pro-life
organizers came from their opposition. Private investigators
contracted by pro-choice groups tracked, photographed, and
collected data on pro-life activists,   and then offered much of
this in-telligence information to the police department.
By accepting this information, the department could have opened
itself to criticism from the pro-life side. But such protests
have not materialized, largely because pro-life organizations
have their own intelligence groups in operation, gathering
similar data on clinic employees, doctors, and patients.
The police department uses this intelligence information to plan
its response to demonstrations and other protest activities. Much
of the success of this effort can be attributed to the approach
taken by the MPD investigator.
During the first critical months of the intelligence-gathering
initiative, the MPD investigator remained open and approachable
to both sides. After introducing himself to pro-life leaders, he
began to attend their groups' public meetings. Although he
remained steadfastly neutral on the issue of abortion, pro-life
organizers accepted the detective in his official role.
Some of the Christian activists even saw his personal conversion
to the cause as a special challenge. While he may have gained
little critical information from these contacts, the personal
interaction enabled him to provide the department's command staff
with his intuitive assessment of the pro-life leadership. His
close involvement with the groups also minimized the effect of an
anticipated disinformation campaign against the police department
as the protests and demonstrations grew.
In contrast, efforts to infiltrate pro-life groups with
undercover officers produced little benefit. Because of the
successful application of racketeering statutes to their
organizations, pro-life leaders avoided discussing any
law-breaking activity in rallies or other public forums.
Therefore, it became difficult for the police department to
anticipate the number and identities of participants in trespass
and civil disobedience incidents prior to the actual events.
Police staffing for the events became a combination of "best
guess" deci-sionmaking and trial and error.
Staffing and Financial Concerns:
Protests and mass-arrest situations are labor-intensive events
that often require more staff than departments can schedule for
regular duty. Thus, staffing becomes a financial challenge for
any agency faced with such events.
In 1993, the MPD spent $51,000 in overtime for peacekeeping and
enforcement duties. Most communities accept such costs as a
natural consequence of the rights of citizens to engage in
peaceful protests. However, in the abortion-rights battle, public
funds can become a propaganda tool for both sides.
Pro-choice leaders decry the need to devote tax dollars to
protect abortion clinics. They attempt to influence public
opinion by claiming that if not for the antiabortion activity,
police could be out fighting crime. Pro-life leaders attack local
governments, questioning why they spend public funds to protect
clinics that perform abortions.
For law enforcement, the obvious need for overtime staffing does
not justify a carte blanche approach to personnel allocation.
Indeed, agencies should plan their staffing levels carefully.
Overstaffing can be interpreted as overreaction and can erode
public and political support for the police as expenses build. At
the same time, understaffing delays an appropriate response to a
fast-breaking event, opening an agency to accusations of
favoritism and lack of preparation.
The MPD approach uses past experience, current intelligence data,
and consensus building  among the command staff to determine the
department's response on a daily basis. Contingency plans, such
as callout lists and mutual-aid requests, complement the daily
plan and allow for a quick escalation of personnel levels as the
need arises.
Use of Force:
During a demonstration, the   arrest procedures and defensive
tactics employed by police become high-visibility--and
potentially high-liability--issues. The public perceives how well
an agency responds to incidents based on the level and type of
force used in restraining, moving, and arresting nonviolent
Antiabortion protesters usually employ passive resistance
techniques when engaged in trespass activities and civil
disobedience. Department administrators decided that officers
should not use take- downs, come-alongs, and pressure point
control techniques in response to the protestors' passive
After reviewing news videos, newspaper photographs, and media
accounts, the command staff concluded that these techniques
produced fewer benefits than their associated costs--images of
over-reaction and the appearance of unnecessary cruelty. Thus,
training becomes a focal point for any agency tasked with
responding to such incidents.
Recognizing the hazards of overreaction, the MPD command staff
developed a thorough training plan, and from the outset,
communicated to officers both the policy and philosophy of the
department's response strategy. Instructors briefed officers on
the respective beliefs and positions of both sides of the
abortion issue and juxtaposed this information with the MPD's
operational plan:
The morality of allowing (abortion) is unquestionably the most
passionate issue of today, and undoubtedly, the personnel of the
Melbourne Police Department hold as varied a collection of
outlooks on the matter as does the general public.
However, our code of ethics requires that we never act
officiously or permit personal feelings, prejudices, animosities
or friendships to influence our decisions and that we will
enforce the law courteously and appropriately, without fear of
Professionally, then, we cannot and will not, collectively or
individually, take sides on the issue of whether abortion is
moral or immoral. It is therefore our intention to safeguard the
rights of holders of both convictions to the best of our ability,
by enforcing the law firmly but compassionately, while respecting
the constitutional rights of all persons.2
This foundation set the tone for more specific training in
perimeter security, crowd control, arrest techniques, and booking
procedures. Advised that both sides of the issue often try to
provoke personal responses from police personnel on the scene,
officers were briefed on deflection responses and the importance
of maintaining neutrality. Instruction also included handling
press inquiries, complaints from neighbors adjacent to the
clinic, and comments from passing motorists.
Training also focused on methods of response to a frequent tactic
used by pro-life groups--individuals' and groups' chaining or
locking themselves to doors, fences, and one another to impede
entry into abortion clinics. In these attempts, the protestors
generally use steel bicycle locks or heavy chains. Therefore,
when responding to pro-life demonstrations, the MPD always comes
prepared with a variety of cutting tools, protective shields, and
specially trained personnel.
The emphasis of the department's philosophy and the depth of
officer training paid off when the level of protests increased in
the spring of 1993. An injunction granted in April 1993,
restricting activities within a buffer zone around the abortion
clinic, led to over 140 arrests in the ensuing weeks. During that
time, no arrestees were injured, although one officer received a
back injury while attempting to catch a protestor who suddenly
had gone limp.
Preparation for events likely to result in mass arrests entails
tre-mendous effort. The wide range of potential scenarios forces
agencies to prepare numerous contingencies. In other words, they
must have a plan for personnel and equipment to respond to a
small protest that could easily either expand or fizzle.
Implementing a response plan involves considerable risk,
especially in financial terms. The MPD spent over $7,000 during
the first week of scheduled protests in spring 1993, but made no
arrests. As the protests grew, the need for more flexibility in
response became clear.
The MPD command staff brainstormed the logistical process by
asking a number of questions. What resources are necessary for
the arrest function? How many arrests should be expected? What
are the best- and worst-case arrest scenarios? How many officers
are needed per arrestee? How long should the booking process
take? What special equipment should be on hand--or quickly
available--each day? The command staff compiled the answers to
these questions into an operational plan for the continuing
The plan outlined job descriptions for all personnel. Many jobs
were combined for small events, but remained separate in the plan
to allow for easy expansion. The plan identified eight command
and logistical positions: Incident commander, field force
commander, tactical commander, arrest processing supervisor,
logistics officer, traffic and security supervisor, supply
officer, and tactical supervisor.
The command staff also compiled a list of equipment that might be
needed during large demonstrations. These items were gathered for
quick issue to officers. Flowcharts and checklists provided
incident commanders with an easy method   to evaluate and control
the police response.
Interagency Coordination:
The police department supplemented its efforts by coordinating
mutual aid with other local and State agencies. An interagency
agreement for mutual aid in emergencies had long been in place.
In addition, the MPD made arrangements with agencies to provide
personnel in the event of a major disturbance. To date, the
police department has not found it necessary to invoke the
However, as arrests mounted in the spring of 1993 and beyond,
police coordination with the Brevard County Detention Center
(BCDC) assumed particular importance. Operated by the Brevard
County Sheriff, the BCDC holds over 800 prisoners serving county
jail terms or awaiting trial, sentencing, or transfer to other
institutions. A large-scale protest easily can produce arrest
numbers that equal 10 to 20 percent of the current jail
Many of the tactics employed by activists--such as refusing to
identify themselves upon arrest--are designed specifically to
land them in jail and thus heighten the impact of their protests.
To reduce booking time at the jail, the police de-partment's
command staff developed an on-scene arrest procedure. Police
personnel photographed arrestees (full face, with no hats or
sunglasses) with the arresting officer. Officers then restrained
the arrestees using flex-cuffs marked with indelible ink. This
procedure simplified the paperwork process once the officers had
positively identified the arrestees.
Department administrators also conducted advanced planning with
the county prosecutor's office. With input from police
administrators, the prosecutor's office predetermined appropriate
charges for given actions and prepared sample narratives for
officers that include all elements of each separate offense. For
major events, an assistant State's attorney provides on-scene
legal advice to the incident commander.
Because pro-life groups often allow, and even encourage, children
to engage in protest activities, the police department also
included the Youth Services Division of the Department of Health
and Rehabilitative Services in the planning process. During
demonstrations, this agency assumes responsibility for
safeguarding children who are in custody due to a parent's
arrest. Policymakers decided to take all juvenile violators into
custody, but to file criminal charges only against those 16 or
older. Younger children are transported from the scene and held
until their parents come to get them.
PLANNING FOR PROTESTS:
Communities of all sizes face the potential for demonstrations
and acts of social protest. Even when peaceful, these events
challenge the resources of local law enforcement agencies.
Because demonstrations can escalate quickly into more menacing
assaults against public order, agencies must prepare for a full
range of response options. Agency administrators should use
specific planning methods to determine appropriate responses. In
the face of potential protests and demonstrations, agencies need
to scan, plan, train, respond, and evaluate.
Police administrators should scan the environment. Does the
community have protest potential? Are there abortion or family
planning  facilities, nuclear plants, military bases, or defense
contractors in the area? Is economic disparity an issue? Are
there civil rights concerns or racial unrest? What types of
protests have occurred locally and regionally?
The size and type of potential protests should dictate the
response. Police administrators should contact their counterparts
in jurisdictions already affected by protests. Law enforcement
agencies must coordinate their planning with related agencies and
Local law enforcement agencies must predetermine task planning,
personnel allocation, and deployment plans. Adequate supervision
of the field force and booking facilities is essential. Police
administrators also should arrange contingency funding through
the local government if current funds appear insufficient.
Effective training cannot occur on the day of the event;
personnel must be trained in advance. Agencies should review and
address use-of-force issues related to nonviolent or passive
resistance. Officers should train in arrest, transportation, and
confinement techniques. Administrators should use training
sessions to assess employee readiness, both on emotional and
physical scales.
When an event occurs, the established reaction plan should be
implemented in increments, according to need. This measured
reaction will enable the police department to escalate or scale
down its response in a more controlled way.
Incident commanders should scan for new tactics, attitudes, and
actions of all participants. Supervisors should monitor personnel
closely for compliance with established policies. When responding
to volatile situations, officers must avoid the temptation to
become overinvolved or to allow emotion to overtake reason.
Agencies should conduct after-action debriefings and report their
findings in detailed postincident reports. The reports should
answer basic questions about the police response. Was the plan
effective? If not, why not? How do command officers, supervisors,
and line officers feel about their performances? What needs to be
The evaluation stage also includes the tabulation of costs.
Agencies should count on various groups--including the press,
politicians, local government administrators, and even the
protesters themselves--to ask how much the police response cost
taxpayers. Of course, each of these groups has different needs
and motives for acquiring this information. No matter how
well-executed its response, the police department should expect
criticism to come from one or more camps.
PREPARING FOR THE NEXT EVENT:
After completing these stages, the agency faces additional tasks.
Scanning, planning, and training for the next potential incident
must begin anew. Unexpected questions should be answered, and old
ones revisited.
Administrators must remember that despite the nonviolent focus of
most social protesters, fringe elements still exist that use
firearms, bombs, and chemical agents to accomplish their goals.
All aspects of the planning process should incorporate a response
strategy for such contingencies.
Social protest--sometimes honorable, sometimes inglorious--has a
long history in the United States. The role of law enforcement is
not to impede legitimate acts of social demonstration but to
enforce court-mandated restrictions and to ensure individual and
community safety. By following a methodical plan and anticipating
problems before they occur, law enforcement can meet the
challenges of contemporary protests successfully.

Fully agreed. I don't dispute that most people calling themselves
separatists are racists; it's just that I'd prefer not to call someone a racist
who isn't one.... just as I'd prefer not to call a liberal a Communist unless
they are one. (Communist referring to the whole dictatorship of the proletariat
business, not just state socialism - the former, which is not classical
Marxism, is where the abuses of rights other than private property come in).
     Abraham Lincoln is one reason I _don't_ use the above definition; by mine,
he'd be a separatist (wanted to move Blacks to Liberia, if I recall correctly).
I trust that everyone involved in this discussion (with the exception of the

who wanted to keep blacks enslaved?
     The definition is bad enough that I checked a concise OED for comparison;
see the results and my commentary below.
     Thank you. The dropping of the cc:cypherpunks part would be rather
inconvenient. This phenomenon is one reason that I'd like to see a list
server capable of setting up mini-lists on demand, easily.
     This has some differences from the Webster definition, specifically the
inclusion of prejudice as a definer. The latter definition is silly. It is
scientifically well-proven that different races have different physical
attributes - blacks tend to have higher blood pressures, for instance. Is this
definition saying that believing what is known is racism?
     Of course, with this definition I can see why Herrnstein and Murray keep
being called racists. (Incidentally, I don't believe they are correct regarding
the genetic component of intelligence as having a racial correlation - the
existing (and unfortunate) environmental differences are a perfectly adequate
explanation. Unfortunately, we can't tell the existence or non-existence of
such differences until the genes affecting intelligence are significantly
better understood; until then, the most pragmatic assumption is the lack of
any such difference, given the lack of any obvious evolutionary cause for it.
In other words, I call _The Bell Curve_ mistaken in its conclusions on race -
not racist. Incindentally, I also believe that such differences are
environmental for the emotional reason that I would be very uncomfortable
believing otherwise. I don't think this is biasing my evaluation of the
science, however.)
Both of these definitions involve "superior" and "superiority"; I thus also
looked this up.
      I don't think anyone would disagree that blacks are currently (and
unfortunately) in a lower position in US society overall. Moreover, the 2nd
and 3rd part of the definition make "racism" as defined above a rather
over-inclusive term. For instance, it would call any scientist who does a
study and finds lower IQs among members of some race a racist. Such differences
are well-known to exist, and (as I state above) are probably environmental
in origin.
      In other words, unless one makes the "prejudice" and/or "antagonism"
parts mandatory (in which case it would be narrower than my definition of
racist, which essentially hinges on definite prejudice existing), the Webster
definition of racism is over-inclusive by any reasonable standard.

Speaking as one who had a Power Macintosh with a 2 gigabyte hard disk drive

had to stand by while the attorney corrupted all the data on my hard drive
trying to beat my PGP encryption. Then he did the same thing to my back

feel in a CRIMINAL matter.
They spent days trying to get past PGP and could not. Even if they had, all
they would have gotten was copies of email between my wife and I. The
downside was it took me two weeks to reconstruct my hard drive, time which
the courts refused to order the attorney that started all this to pay me
for. (They did sanction him after he threatened to punch me during a
deposition for refusing to reveal my sources - which were protected by
attorney-client privilege - which I thought was interesting; apparently he
could waste all my time, but he couldn't hit me.) The court decided my data
had no value and that having to rebuild my hard drive was a "minor

Since it is a no win situation, extending cooperation is problematic. It

growing tendency). The ID in question can be biometric, and thus can't be
passed (easily) from one person to another once the head tax has been paid on
it. Now, what sorts of points one can ask for identification is one place where
it gets interesting. If you are doing property taxes, then you can require
that the "registered owner" present the cash. But that doesn't prevent someone
from hiring someone else to be the registered owner. However, except for
schemes such as Assasination Politics et al, enforcing that supposed owner from
becoming the de facto as well as de jure owner can be difficult. (In other
words, if he says you don't own the property, and the state backs him up
because he's paid his head tax and you haven't, then you've got a problem.)
Other such interactions are whenever you get caught doing something physical,
such as through various police stings. If you don't have your head tax paid
on some ID with biometric links to you, then you get put in jail longer.
seizures (or even destruction) of property and persons on such grounds will
become more and more frequent and easy. Unconstitutional in most cases?
Probably... but they may stop caring.

individual choices (with the most important of such choices being those
known as civil liberties), I currently believe that this is for the best.)

Research Position in Distributed Document Technologies at Rank Xerox Research
Centre, Cambridge
Rank Xerox Research Centre, Cambridge Laboratory is part of an expanding
European based research centre which includes a second site in Grenoble.  The
Cambridge Laboratory carries out interdisciplinary research in the development
and use of technologies for supporting distributed organisations, with a strong
emphasis on the human and organisational aspects of technology in use.  The
laboratory has close links with a number of divisions of Xerox and Rank Xerox,
and collaborates with other research groups in the UK, continental Europe and
the US.
Our research programme (Studies of Technology, Organisations and Work) combines
social science and technical perspectives on the design of systems for use in
the workplace. Our current research projects are examining the boundaries
across which distributed document work is conducted. In formulating our
long-term research strategy we are focusing on investigating these in terms of
personal; inter- and intra- organisational; work-practice; cultural; temporal,
and geographical boundaries, and developing ways to take account of their
implications for system design.
We are seeking a research scientist to play a major role in developing new
approaches to distributed document technology from this perspective. The
appointee is likely to have a background in computer science or a related
discipline, with an understanding of distributed and collaborative
technologies. Applicants are expected to have a keen interest not only in the
infrastructural issues of distributed systems, but also in incorporating
social, organisational and psychological dimensions of work into the design and
development of novel networked systems. The appointed person will take primary
responsibility for the technological component of our programme and will join a
multi-disciplinary team involving computer science, pychology and sociology.

Hi, all,
I would like to alarm you that another Big-Brother is coming with its most
ambitios dream in South Korea: The Electronic Identification Card, which
will be issued to every citizen as a mandatory within a year or so.
The Electronic Identification Card project is a part of South Korean
government's ultra-speed communication network building project. Managed by
the Ministry of Domestic Affairs, the US $413 million project is being
carried out in cooperation with the Korea Computer Institute. Once the
project is completed in 1997, every Koreans of 18 years or older will be
assigned a single integrated circuit (IC) card which will include photo
and all kinds of personal digitized information: current universal ID card
(currently every adult Korean has a photo ID issued by the Government),
driver's license, medical insurance card, national pension card, proof
of residence, and scanned fingerprints (!) among other things.
(I don't know how many "demoratic" governments are collecting fingerprints of
their whole citizens.)
DACOM, a big telecommunication company in Korea, which won the bidding
for the project, describes it as following:
"As 8,000 characters worth of information can be stored on the single
credit card-sized card, personal information needed for issuing official
documents and certificates can be accessed promptly by public offices,
institutions, companies, and banks or other organizations. The Ministry
of Domestic Affairs has announced that the new cards will be distributed
starting in January 1997. Full implementation is scheduled to be
completed by early 1998. While there are some nations in which drivers'
licenses are used in place of ID cards, this project will be the first
system in the world which combines multiple functions onto one card.
Once distribution is completed, the card will greatly boost efficiency,
saving the government US$1.3 billion and enabling it to eventually
reduce its work force by 5,000 employees."
(Quoted from: As you can see, they have no concerns about protection of personal
information and privacy. True, they are a company making money from that
project, and probably we shouldn't expect any criticism against the Project.
The problem is, however, that almost all of the South Korean news media
are talking the same thing about it: the "efficiency" and the "convenience"
that the Electronic Identification Card might bring about.
I tried to find critical arguments against the project via a comprehensive
news data base in Korea, but I could not find any.  I also checked many web
sites of non-governmental organizations and socio-progressive groups in
Korea, but none of them have raised the issue yet. They do not seem to
realize the suspending dangers of their own privacy and human rights.
Despite obvious and serious danger in protecting personal information and
privacy , there is just no social discourse concerning the issue.
I have also checked relevant laws (especially newly approved
communication-related laws) through the database of the Korean
Government, but there seems to be no clear legal basis for the project. The
project has been mentioned only in the "10 Plans for Efficient National
Informatization," announced by the Ministry of Information and
Communication. But the City of Seoul already started to issue the Card
as a "test" in March. The Ministry of Domestic Affairs said, as they
were issuing the "test" version of the Card to 1,000 citizens, "we will
prepare relevant laws and regulations," implying that they are doing the
project "before" (and probably "above") the law.
Currently, I am writing columns and news stories for "Sisa Jouranl," the
weekly news magazine in South Korea, which decided to deal with the Card
project as a special topic as I suggested. To write a critical article
against the Project, I am starting to gather info about the similar cases,
if there is any. And I hope to hear from you about some theoretical and
practical knowledge about the similar issues; I would like to quote your
opinions in my article, if you allow me to do so.
Right after the publication of the news article, I will try to contact
various NGO's in South Korea to inform them of the importance of the issue.
And I will try to organize an anti-electronic ID Card movement in the
cyberspace, if that is necessary.
I am very happy to meet you in the cyberspace, who really concerns the
privacy issues in the computerized age.
Thank you very much.

Report 1
I just returned from a fascinating week in Montreal, Canada where I
attended the INET '96 conference held by the Internet Society. I will
try to write some reports about what happened at the Conference in the
next week or two as it would be good to have the online community
discuss some of the issues that were raised at the Conference.
What became clear at the conference was that this is an important time in the development of the Internet. People from around the world attended the conference and most expressed the desire that
the Internet be made available in their countries for education
and scientific and other uses. Some of the focus of the conference
was on business uses of the Internet, but it seemed that there was
a great concern among the people I spoke to that the Internet be
available for educational and scientific and government and community purposes, not just for business uses.
I want to start this report however, with the last talk that was
given at the conference. The final talk was to be given by Reed Hunt
of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. He didn't attend
however, and instead the talk was given by Blair Levin, Chief of Staff at the FCC instea.
A version of the talk is available at the FCC www site. The talk was a surprise as it seemed uninformed both about the history and importance of the Internet and of the important public
policy considerations that need to be taken into account when making
any rules for regulating the Internet. At the beginning of the talk, there was the statement that Reed Hunt
was the first FCC Chairman to have a computer on his desk, but that he asked his staff to explain how the Internet works. So instead
of a commitment to learn about how the Internet developed and the significant impact it is having on the world, the speech presented
us with the glib "the Internet gives us the opportunity to change
all our communications policies."
The problem with this is that the FCC is therefore starting from
scratch, throwing out all the lessons that have helped the Internet
to grow and develop, and instead, creating its own models.
In his talk Blair Levin listed five principles. They were:
1) How can public policy promote expansion of band width?
2) What rules can we get rid of or have?
3) The concern with pricing.
4) How to make sure it reaches everyone, especially kids in schools.
5) How to make sure it reaches across the globe.
The problem with this was that it took universal service as the 4th
point, and then basically substituted access by kids in schools for
the principle of universal service.
During the talk Blair described how the NTIA (the National
Telecommunications Information Administration) had submitted an
important paper to the FCC on the issue of voice over the Internet.
This made clear that the NTIA has not submitted any paper to the FCC
on the issue of universal service, despite the fact that they held an
online hearing on several issues, including universal service and the
Internet, in November 1994 and the NTIA has done nothing to act on the
broad expression of sentiment for universal service that was expressed
during that online public meeting.
When asked about that online meeting, Blair said that the FCC knew of
the meeting. However, it seems to have had no effect on their
deliberations, or on the request of people that the FCC open up their
decision making process so that the people who are being affected by
their decisions have a means of providing input into those decisions.
In response to a question about the need for universal service Blair
responded that that was the obligation of other branches of the
U.S. government like the Department of Education.
He said this despite the fact that at the current moment the FCC is
supposedly making rules to provide for the universal service
provisions of the Telecommunications Act passed by the U.S. Congress
in Feb. 1996.
Also, he claimed to welcome submissions into their process, but when
told that it would cost over $50 to pay postage costs for a submission
since there were over 35 people who had to be served (and postage on a
minimal submission was $1.45), he said to see Kevin Werbach a lawyer
at the FCC, who had come with him. Kevin Werbach offered no means of
dealing with the high cost of making a submission.
Many people at the Internet Society Conference applauded in response
to the question about the lack of concern by the FCC for the principle
of universal service to the Internet. At the Internet Society
conference many people spoke up about the need in their countries,
whether that be Canada, or Norway, or Ghana, etc. for the Net to be
more widespread and available to the public for educational and
community purposes. Many were concerned about the lack of ability of
the so called "market forces" to provide networking access to other
than corporate or well to do users. Yet here was a talk being given in
the name of the Chairman of the regulatory body in the U.S. charged
with making the rules to provide for universal service, and the talk
was unconcerned with the important issues and problems that issue of
providing universal service to the Internet raises.
It is unfortunate that Reed Hunt didn't come to the conference and
take the challenge to learn what the real concerns of people around
the world are with regard to access to the Internet. Isolated in
Washington, with no access to him possible for most people (though
someone from one company told me that he was told to send him email
whenever he had a concern), it seems difficult for the rules process
to be able to produce any helpful outcome. There need to be open
meetings and sessions where people who are concerned with these issues
are invited to be heard and to discuss these issues with the
FCC. Instead the process is going on behind the same closed doors that
the crafting of the Telecommunications Act was created by the
U.S. Congress.
It is a tribute to the Internet Society that they did make an effort
to invite government officials like Reed Hunt to the conference.
The FCC will be setting an example for the rest of the world by the
telecommunications policy rules it creates. Will the policy be one
that recognizes that the so called "market" cannot provide the free or
low cost access to the Internet that is necessary to make such
universal service a reality? Will the rules created be based on
looking back at how time sharing and the the ARPANET and the Internet
developed so it can build on those lessons?  To have those rules be
based on firm lessons from the past and firm principles that can make
them fruitful, it is necessary that the FCC process creating those
rules be much more open than it is at present. If the FCC could learn
from the experience of the Internet and set up newsgroups and real
email access to the officials involved that would demonstrate a
commitment to a more equitable access to the Internet and to the fcc
rulemaking that is needed to make the Internet available to all. But
from the recent talk by the FCC official presented at INET '96, there
seems little indication that the need for an open process and a many
to many means of communication is recognized among those at the FCC
and thus there is even less evidence that the FCC is capable of making
rules to apply the principle of universal service to make Internet
access available to all.

liberal types is that of zoning laws and restrictive covanents. The
(unfortunately legally accepted) justification, as I understand it, for many
zoning laws is that they prevent reductions in property values. Restrictive
covanents, such as against blacks or AIDS patients, have the same argument for
them, if one accepts the logic of the proposed restrictions. Blacks/whoever
moving in causes racists (or people anticipating the actions of racists) not to
want to move in or causes them to sell; this reduces local property values. By
the logic of the proposed restrictions, that means blacks/whoever should be held
responsible for the decrease in property values and barred or fined.
_person_ in a chain of causation are you the person making a decision for which
you should be blameable. (By person I refer to that people are the only beings
capable of making such a choice. I neither treat cows as having rights/choices
nor do I hold a bull criminally responsible for goring someone. Rights mean
responsibility; choices mean consequences.) Otherwise, someone else has the

Abstract:  Electronic commerce is widely expected to promote
"friction-free" capitalism, with consumers sending software agents to
scour the Net for the best deals.  Many distribution chains will
indeed be simplified and costs substantially reduced.  However, we are
also likely to see the creation of artificial barriers in electronic
commerce, designed by sellers to extract more value from consumers.
Frequent flyer mileage plans and the bundling of software into suites
are just two examples of the marketing schemes that are likely to
proliferate.  It appears that there will be much less a la carte
selling of individual items than is commonly expected, and more
subscription plans.  Therefore many current development plans should
be redirected.  Electronic commerce is likely to be even more
exasperating to consumers than current airline pricing, and will be
even further removed from the common conception of a "just price."  As
a result, there are likely to be more attempts to introduce government
regulation into electronic commerce.

1.  Introduction
Electronic commerce (or ecommerce for short) is still small, at least
if we consider only online consumer transactions, such as ordering a
book from amazon.com over the Internet.  In a broader sense, ecommerce
is much larger, since financial, news, and legal information services
such as Bloomberg, Reuters, and Lexis have total revenues in the
billions of dollars.  In a still broader sense, electronic funds
transfers are already huge, with daily transactions in the trillions
of dollars.  All these types of transactions are expected to grow, and
to become part of a much larger and uniform system of electronic
While we are rapidly moving towards the Information Age, food,
shelter, and clothing will remain our most important needs.  However,
their shares of the economy are decreasing, and the information
content of their goods is increasing.  This is an old trend.
Agriculture has moved from being the largest segment of the economy a
century and a half ago to a relatively minor industry, dwarfed by the
medical sector, for example.  Furthermore, the cost of the basic
ingredients in cereals and other foods is a small portion of the total
price.  As a further example of the decreasing value of raw materials
and factory labor, a single celebrity is often paid as much for
endorsing an athletic shoe model as all the workers in the undeveloped
countries who assemble those shoes.  We can expect a continuation of
this trend, with the work of the "symbolic analysts" (who, in Robert
Reich's terminology, include lawyers, software writers, and
advertising executives) making up increasing fractions of the economy.
The main concern of this essay is electronic trade in information
goods, such as news, novels, software, music, movies, as well as
legal, medical, and credit information.  How will these goods be
distributed, and how will their production be financed?  Esther Dyson
[Dyson] predicts that almost all intellectual content will be
available for free.  In her view, some content production will be
supported by outside advertisers (who already pay for most of the cost
of newspapers, for example, as well as all the costs of the commercial
TV networks).  Some content will likely be made available for free, as
a form of advertising for other services by the producers (as the
Grateful Dead do in encouraging people to tape their performances, in
the hope this will bring more people to their concerts).  While
Dyson's vision will come true for a large part of the material on the
Net, it seems unlikely that it will be universal.  Movie studios such
as Disney attract large paying audiences to theaters and purchasers to
their videotapes through the quality of their products, and are likely
to do so in the future.  While some novelists make more money from
selling movie rights to their plots to Hollywood than from royalties
on books, this is rare.  Each year, over a hundred times as many books
are published as there are movies produced, and the sales of books are
much higher than movie theater revenues.  Thus we can expect that
content producers will usually want to be paid directly for their
work, as that will be the only feasible route to earning a living.
Furthermore, Dyson herself [Dyson] emphasizes that much of the value
on the Net "will go to the middlemen and trusted intermediaries who
add value - everything from guarantees of authenticity to software
support, selection, filtering, interpretation, and analysis."  How
will these middlemen be paid?  It seems likely that often they will
wish to collect payment directly from consumers, just as the online
legal information service Westlaw collects fees from attorneys who use
it.  The basic data in Westlaw is court opinions, which are freely
avaialable.  What gives Westlaw its lock on the market is the control
of its citation system.
Many of Dyson's predictions are likely to come true.  In particular,
huge amounts of intellectual property will be available for free.
However, it seems likely that there will also be a flourishing
ecommerce sector, with individuals purchasing goods and services.  The
question is, how will ecommerce be conducted?
The usual expectation is that ecommerce will promote "friction-free
capitalism," (cf.  [Gates]), with distribution costs reduced.  It is
easy to see how this can happen, as the older communication systems
such as the post office, the telegraph, the telephone, and the fax
have all served to make the economy more efficient.  The Internet
creates many more possibilities.  Classified ads, for example, bring
in a large fraction of the revenues of the newspaper industry, but can
be replaced by a much cheaper and easier to use electronic system.
Other part of the common vision of ecommerce are more questionable,
however, and that is what the rest of this essay will discuss.  It is
often thought that instead of buying an entire newspaper, readers will
pay for those individual stories they are interested in.  Someone
wishing to purchase a VCR might send an "intelligent agent" into the
Internet to collect bids from suppliers for a unit that meets desired
specifications, and then select the best choice.  While such scenarios
will be feasible technically, it is extremely unlikely they will be
dominant.  Instead, we are likely to see a proliferation of policies
such as those of current music CD retailers who sell on the Internet.
Most of them do not allow software agents to collect their prices.  We
are also likely to see a strenthening of the trend towards
subscription services and bundling of products, as is done in software
suites today.  This will often require redirection of development
This essay is devoted largely to an explanation of the economic
reasons that are likely to lead to the creation of "bumps" on the
electronic superhighway.  These reasons operate already in the current
economy, and are responsible, for example, for the U.S. airline
pricing system, which is a source of frequent frustration and
complaints.  In ecommerce, frustration and complaints are likely to be
even more frequent.  The reasons for this are twofold.  On one hand,
the economic incentives to create artificial barriers will be greater
in ecommerce than today, since essentially all costs will be one time
costs of creating goods, and distribution will be practically free.
On the other hand, it will be much more transparent that the barriers
are artificial.  This will often collide with popular notions of what
is fair, and is likely to lead to attempts at much more intrusive
government regulations than we have seen so far.  In the past
governments have been involved primarily in security issues of the
Net, and more recently have gotten concerned about pornography.
However, in the future they are likely to attempt to regulate the
conduct of business on the Net as well.
If the predictions of this essay come true, then some of the current
development efforts will turn out to be misdirected.  In particular,
there is likely to be much less use of micropayments for individual
transactions, and more subscription services, which require different
systems.  Also, it will be necessary to prepare to comply with edicts
from various governments which will be changing and will often be
2.  Natural and artificial barriers in commerce
Capitalism is excellent at inducing people to reduce barriers to
commercial activities.  However, it also produces incentives to create
artificial barriers.  Some of the barriers are created by government
action, such as those of patent and copyright laws, which give owners
of intellectual property a limited legal monopoly on the uses of their
creations.  Other barriers are created by merchants.  It is common for
an airline passenger to have paid 5 times as much as the person in an
adjacent seat, with the only difference between the two being that the
first one is not away from home on a Saturday night.  The airlines
would like to charge the business travelers (who are presumed to be
able and willing to pay) more than vacationers (who might drive a car
instead or not travel at all), but do not have a direct way to do so.
Therefore they impose the Saturday night stopover restrictions to
distinguish between those two classes of customers.  There have been
several attempts by airlines to move towards a simpler system of
uniform pricing (sometimes by newcomers, such as People Express,
sometimes by established carriers), but they all collapsed.  This
suggests that there is an underlying economic logic behind this
system, however exasperating it might be.  If that is so, though, we
can expect similar moves in ecommerce.
The general tendency in the marketplace is to avoid "commoditization,"
in which there are many almost equivalent products and services, and
where price is the only consideration.  Ford does not compete with
Honda in producing the most inexpensive Accord.  Instead, it offers
the Taurus as an alternative, and there are many features in which the
Accord and Taurus differ.  Sometimes commoditization is hard to
resist.  In some cases this happens because consumers learn there is
little to differentiate products.  As an example, oil companies have
pretty much given up on trying to convince people that gasoline
differs in anything other than octane ratings.  In other cases,
commoditization is forced on an industry by government edict or
effective private monopoly.  Intel and Microsoft have reduced the
IBM-compatible PC industry to a commodity business, in which they
collect almost all the profits, and the other players scramble to find
a niche that will enable them to do more than just break even.
However, those are the exceptions.  The general ecological principle
is towards evolution of species that fill different roles.  Zebras do
not attempt to compete with giraffes, but exploit a different part of
the ecosystem, and evolution does not lead to a convergence of those
two species.  Similarly, in the world of business, companies try to
differentiate their products.  Workstation producers could never in
the past agree on a common version of Unix, even under the threat of
being overwhelmed by PCs, since that would have required giving up the
distinctive features that bound them to their customers.  Even
airlines, which are basically in the commodity business of moving
people from one city to another, try to differentiate themselves
through frequent flier plans and special pricing schemes.
Ecommerce is likely to lead to a proliferation of pricing plans that
will seem to most people to be much more frustrating and less rational
than even today's U.S. airlines.  There will probably be a niche
market for people who care most about their convenience, and will use
their intelligent agents to do their shopping for them.  However, what
Sony, for example, might do is sell to that market only models of VCRs
that are not available elsewhere, and are hard to compare to those
sold in other places.  Stores that have physical buildings are likely
to serve a different clientele, and might also take further steps to
differentiate themselves to prevent comparison shopping, which will be
much easier with many people sharing their experiences on the
Internet.  There is likely to be a proliferation of frequent-shopper
plans.  Further, Sony VCRs sold in Sears stores might be slightly
different from those sold in WalMart, and model numbers and features
might change rapidly to inhibit consumer rating services (such as
Consumer Reports, or various Internet-based group-rating schemes that
are beginning to develop).  There are already artificial barriers to
free information flow.  Grocery stores routinely bar employees of
other stores from collecting extensive data on prices.  The policy of
Internet CD stores of preventing software agents from collecting
prices for comparison shopping is just an extension of such barriers
to free information flow to ecommerce.  We can expect more such
While barriers to commerce of the type discussed above are usually
perceived as unfair (an issue that I will deal with more extensively
in the last section), they can increase not just the producers'
wealth, but economic efficiency and social welfare.  As a simple
example, consider an independent consultant who can produce a
technical report that two different customers might be willing to pay
$3,000, and $2,000 for, respectively.  If she has to charge a uniform
price to the two customers, the most she can get is $4,000, obtained
by pricing the report at $2,000.  However, if she charges the first
customer $3,000, and the other $2,000, she will earn $5,000.  If the
consultant's time and expenses to prepare the report are worth $4,500,
she will not undertake the effort if a uniform price is required.
to charge different prices to different customers.  However, the
customer that pays $3,000 is likely to resent it if somebody else
obtains the same product for $2,000, and often will not agree to the
deal if all conditions are publicly known.  This is caused by a
conflict between notions of economic efficiency and fairness.  There are many examples in the marketplace of behavior that appears even less fair.  For example, in 1990, IBM introduced the LaserPrinter E, a lower cost version of its LaserPrinter.  The two version were
identical, except that the E version printed 5 pages per minute
instead of 10 for the regular one.  This was achieved (as was found by
independent testers, and was not advertised by IBM) through the
addition of additional chips to the E version that did nothing but
slow down processing.  Thus the E model cost more to produce, sold for
less, and was less useful.  However, as Deneckere and McAfee show in
their paper [DeneckereM], which contains many more examples of this
type (referred to as "damaged goods"), it can be better for all
classes of consumers to allow such behavior, however offensive it
might be to the general notions of fairness.  Consumers who do not
need to print much, and are not willing to pay for the more expensive
version, do obtain a laser printer.  Consumers who do need high
capacity obtain a lower price than they might otherwise have to pay
since the manufacturer's fixed costs are spread over more units.
Barriers in commerce are an essential part of the current marketplace.
Consider the book trade.  Although people do not think of it this way,
current practices involve charging different prices to different
users, and thus maximizing revenues.  A novel is typically published
in hard cover first, with the aim of extracting high prices from those
willing to pay more to read it right away.  Once that market is fully
exploited, a somewhat cheaper trade paperback edition is made
available, to collect revenue from those not willing to pay for the
hardbound copy.  Finally, a regular paperback edition is published at
an even lower price.  The used book market develops in parallel, for
those willing to read books marked up by previous owners, and so on.
How will ecommerce affect book publishing?  Eventually we can expect
that all books will be available electronically (and will evolve
towards new forms, made possible by digital communications).  Costs of
publishing will come down, and this is going to increase the supply,
and lead to many works distributed for free, by aspiring authors
hungry for the recognition that might lead to fortune.  What about
those electronic books that people will be willing to pay for?  With
publishing costs reduced, we can expect that the authors' share of the
revenues will rise, say from the current 15% or so royalty rate to 50%
or more, and so in effect the authors might become much more
influential than the publishers (or might become the publishers
themselves).  However, since publishers obviously benefit from the
present system of differential pricing, they (and the authors) are
likely to have an incentive to institute a similar system in the
digital arena.  The issue is how to do this.  Bits are bits, after
all, and are easy to copy.  If we make only simple extensions of
current copyright laws, we are likely to see a great change in the
marketplace for information goods.  For example, when I buy a book, I
cannot make a copy of it and sell that copy to somebody else.  On the
other hand, I can sell, rent, or give away the book I purchased to
anyone I wish.  Suppose we carry over exactly the same rights to the
digital world, with some combination of cryptographic techniques and
laws guaranteeing that unauthorized copies of digital "books" cannot
be made.  The ease of transactions on the Net (which is what leads to
the dreams of "frictionless capitalism") would then force major
changes.  With physical volumes, there are substantial barriers to
trade in books.  Most people do not like reading books that are
tattered or marked up by others.  They take their time reading books,
and (especially for the ones they enjoy) like to retain them in their
libraries to be reread any time they wish.  As a result of these
natural barriers, a single copy is usually read by only a few people.
The economics of the present book publishing business depend on this
phenomenon.  In the digital world, though, with high bandwidth
networks and efficient intermediaries, I could buy a copy of a book an
hour before bedtime, read a new chapter, and then, just before turning
off the lights, send that copy off for resale.  Instead of a million
copies of a printed book, a thousand electronic copies might suffice.
This would force a dramatic change in the structure of the book
publishing industry, and explains why there is an intense interest in
the creation of artificial barriers to ecommerce, either through
revisions to copyright laws or through technological methods.
3.  The bumps on the electronic highway
Some types of barriers to commerce are accepted as natural when
dealing with physical goods.  It would be prohibitively expensive for
the New York Times, say, to distribute 100 little sheets each day,
each one with a separate story, and having readers buy just the ones
they were interested in.  The accepted wisdom is that ecommerce will
lead to the electronic equivalent of just that, with readers selecting
and paying for individual stories.  It will certainly be possible to
do so, as micropayment systems are being developed that will allow for
processing of tiny transactions, such as payment for a single story in
the New York Times, or a "hit" on some aspiring poet's Web page that
contains his sonnets.  However, the economic argument is that while
such schemes might exist, and may be used in some situations, they
will not be dominant.  The example of book publishing in the previous
section shows why producers of information goods benefit from the
natural barriers that exist in the physical world.  Their incentives
to create artificial barriers in the digital world will be even
stronger.  It will be harder to distinguish between consumers, since
transactions will tend to be impersonal, and arbitrage will be easy.
Most important, distribution costs will be negligible, so that only
the "first copy" cost of creating a work will matter.  Hence
traditional, commodity-market type of competition, in which the market
price equals the marginal cost, will have to be avoided, since
marginal prices will be essentially zero.  The incentive that low
marginal costs provide to create barriers in commerce can already be
seen in many high technology fields.  The "damaged goods" studied in
[DeneckereM] come primarily from such areas.  The pharmaceutical
industry is notorious for selling products for hundreds of times more
than the cost of producing them, and for selling the same chemicals
for human use for ten times the price charged for veterinary purposes.
While the incentives to erect artificial barriers will be large in
ecommerce, there will also be novel possibilities created by the
electronic medium.  What kinds of barriers are we likely to encounter
in ecommerce?  The four most important ones will probably be bundling,
differential pricing, subscriptions, and site licensing.  Hal Varian
[Varian3] discusses the first two in detail, and argues convincingly
that they will be prominent in ecommerce.  In the rest of this section
I will present some additional arguments for these techniques, and
will also show why subscription services (which are a form of
bundling, but are important for other reasons as well) and site
licensing are also likely to be common.  There are additional
arguments in favor of subscription and site licensing plans.  For
example, security problems are likely to be easier in those cases.
However, this essay will deal only with the economic arguments.
The basic assumption in the economic analyses below is that for each
information good, an individual consumer will purchase it only if the
price is below some threshold (that consumer's valuation of the good).
For simplicity, I will only consider items that are independent of
each other (such as stories in a newspaper).  Much of the economic
literature cited below is concerned with goods that are related in one
way or another.  (For example, if I buy a spreadsheet from Corel, I am
unlikely to purchase another one from Microsoft.  On the other hand,
if I buy a presentation package, I am more likely to buy a CD-ROM of
pictures than I would otherwise.)  I will not take these factors into
consideration, to keep the presentation simple, and bring out only the
main factors that are likely to influence the development of
ecommerce.  I will also assume that producers cannot in general find
out what an individual is willing to pay for a product, but can,
through test marketing, say, obtain an accurate statistical
description of the valuations that the whole population of potential
buyers place on that product.
3.1 Bundling
Bundling consists of offering several goods together in a single
package, such as combining a word processor, a spreadsheet, and a
presentation program in a software suite (such as Microsoft Office),
or else printing many stories in a single newspaper.  Bundling is
common, and often seems natural.  For example, right shoes and left
shoes are invariably sold together, and just about the only time
anyone might regret this is when a dog chews up one of a new pair of
shoes.  I will concentrate on bundling of goods that are almost
unrelated, such as a word processor and a spreadsheet program.  Why
should the pair of them together sell for much less than the sum of
their separate prices?  It is useful to have seamless integration of
the two, to make it easier to move material between them, to have
common command structure and icon layouts, and so on.  That seems to
argue for charging more for the bundle than for the pieces!  However,
bundling, with a lower price for the bundle than for the components,
or even without any possibility for purchasing the components
separately, is extremely common.  The reason is that it allows the
producer to increase revenues by capturing more of the "consumer
surplus" that arises when customers pay less than they are willing to
do.  Since in general prices have to be the same for all customers,
bundling can be used to smooth out the uneven preferences people have
for different goods and services.  For example, suppose we were
dealing with a proposal to start a newspaper that would have two
sections, a business page and a sports page.  Suppose also that there
were just two potential readers, Alice and Bob. Suppose also that
Alice needs to keep up with the business world, and so is willing to
pay $0.50 for the business page, but only $0.20 for the sports page,
since she does not particularly care about sports, but might like to
keep up with lunchtime conversations.  Suppose that Bob's preferences
are reversed, in that he is an eager sports fan, willing to pay $0.50
for the sports page, but only $0.20 for the business page, since all
he cares about is occasionally checking on his retirement fund.  Under
those conditions, how should the proposed newspaper be priced?  If
each section is sold separately, then a price of $0.20 for each will
induce both Alice and Bob to buy both sections, for total revenues of
$0.80.  If the price is set at $0.50 for each section, then Alice will
buy only the business page, and Bob only the sports page, for total
revenue of $1.00.  On the other hand, if the two sections are bundled
together, then a price for both of $0.70 will induce both Alice and
Bob to purchase the newspaper, and will produce total revenues of
$1.40.  Thus the economically rational step is not to offer the two
sections separately, but only bundled together.
Bundling has been studied extensively in the literature, starting with
the paper of Burnstein [Burnstein].  Other references are [AdamsY,
Bowman, Economides1, KrishnaKA, Schmalensee, Stigler, Varian2,
Wilson1, Wilson2].  Unfortunately there is no simple prescription that
can be given as to when bundling is better than selling items
separately.  Depending on the distribution of consumer preferences,
bundling can be either more or less profitable for the producer, as
was already shown by Adams and Yellen [AdamsY].  However, there are
some general guidelines.  One is that bundling becomes more profitable
as marginal costs decrease (which may be part of the reason for the
spread of software suites as the amount of unpaid support provided to
users by software houses decreased).  Another is that bundling becomes
more attractive when consumer preferences are negatively correlated
(as in the example above, where Alice and Bob had almost opposite
tastes).  However, negative correlation in valuations is not necessary
for bundling to be profitable, as was first pointed out by Schmalensee
[Schmalensee], and as will be shown in the example below.  Random
variations in preferences are sufficient as a result of the law of
large numbers.
How much of a difference can bundling make to a producer's bottom
line?  Unfortunately the published literature is practically silent on
this point, for reasons I will discuss later.  (There is an intriguing
computation in [Stigler], based on reported revenues of movie theaters
in different cities.)  Let us therefore consider some artificial
examples, a bit more realistic than the Alice and Bob one presented
above.  Consider two books, A and B, say "The Tannu-Tuva Cookbook" and
"Sherlock Holmes in Antarctica."  Suppose that among one million
potential customers, book A is valued at $1 by 100,000, at $2 by
another 100,000, and so on, up to $10 by 100,000, and suppose the same
distribution of valuations applies to book B. Suppose further that the
valuations of the two books are independent.  Thus there are about
10,000 customers who value book A at $3 and simultaneously book B at
$5, and similarly about 10,000 customers who place values $9 and $2 on
A and B, respectively.  Under these conditions, if the publisher is to
sell these books separately, revenue will be maximized when the price
of each is set at $5.  About 600,000 people will purchase each book,
for total revenue from sales of both books of $6,000,000.  (This
maximum is not unique, as the same revenue can be achieved by pricing
each book at $6, in which case about 500,000 people will buy each.)
However, if the two books are sold together, revenue can be made much
higher.  Since there are 10,000 people who value the bundle at $2
(exactly the 10,000 who value each book at $1), while there are 90,000
who value it at $10, a short calculation shows that the
revenue-maximizing price is $9.  At the price of $9 per bundle,
720,000 people will purchase it, for total revenue of $6,480,000,
exactly 8% higher than if the books were sold separately.  Since
profits would be the revenues minus the fixed costs of producing the
books, they would increase much more dramatically.
What weakens the case for bundling is that most people have no
interest in most goods.  In the example of the books "Sherlock Holmes
in Antarctica" and "The Tannu-Tuva Cookbook," a more realistic
assessment might be that in a population of 1,000,000, each book would
be valued at zero by 90% of the population, with 10,000 valuing it at
$1, 10,000 at $2, and so on.  If the 100,000 people who do place a
positive value on book A are distributed independently of those who
value book B at $1 or more, then there would be only 10,000 people who
place positive values on both A and B. Bundling under these conditions
would not produce much benefit.  However, even in cases of extreme
indifference, bundling can work if there are enough goods.  Consider
an information service with 1,000 items (news stories, pictures, or
songs).  Suppose that in a large population, each individual is
totally uninterested in 900 of the items, and values 10 at $0.01 each,
10 at $0.02 each, and so on, with 10 valued at $0.10 each.  If the
items are to be sold individually, the revenue-maximizing price will
be $0.05 for each (or $0.06 each), and each customer will purchase 60
items for a total of $3.00.  However, if the collection is sold as a
whole (which involves no extra cost to producers of information goods,
and also no cost of tossing out mounds of unwanted boxes to
consumers), then a price of $5.50 will induce each person to buy, for
a gain of 83% in revenues (and much more in profits).
So far we have compared only sales of unbundled products (pure
unbundling) to those of bundles (pure bundling).  However, it is often
advantageous to use mixed bundling, where both bundles and separate
goods are offered.  In the example of the books "Sherlock Holmes in
Antarctica" and "The Tannu-Tuva Cookbook," with the distribution of
valuations assumed above, a price of $10 for the bundle and $5 for
each book separately would produce revenue of $7,400,000, about 14%
higher than pure bundling, and over 23% higher than pricing the books
separately.  (Note that the optimal combination above has the
paradoxical property that the price of the bundle is exactly the price
of the pieces.  Under the assumption of the model, people who value
book A at $7 and book B at $3 will purchase the bundle, but if the
bundle is not available, will only purchase A.) Adams and Yellen
[AdamsY] have shown that mixed bundling is always more advantageous to
the producer than pure bundling.
Toy models like the one above are amusing to play with, and help
illustrate the advantages to producers of bundling.  If the
distribution of consumer valuations is known, one can determine
numerically what the optimal policy is for the producer [Wilson1,
Wilson2].  Unfortunately the basic assumption that consumers know what
value they place on various goods, and purchase them precisely when
the price is below their value, is questionable.  In practice people
behave in much more complicated ways.  An old joke illustrates this:
  Waiter:  And for dessert, we have chocolate mousse, apple pie,
    and ice cream.
  Customer:  I will have apple pie.
  Waiter:  Oh, I forgot to mention that we also have Peach Melba.
  Customer:  In that case I will have the mousse.
While this is a joke, actual behavior is often just as paradoxical.
Catalog merchants have learned that the attractiveness of an item is
affected strongly not just by its price and description, but also by
its placement among other offers.  Consumer choices are complicated.
Some of the seemingly irrational behavior can be explained on the
basis of different consumers having different sensitivities to prices.
For example, the phenomenon of regular sales has been modeled
successfully this way in [Varian1] and later papers.  Other
interesting phenomena emerge if one assumes that consumers do respond
to price signals in an economically rational way, but with some delay
(see [RichardsonR], for example).  However, there is no complete
theory.  Experimental economics has shown that economically optimal
solutions can be attained even with small groups of agents, provided
they are working in a constrained environment and are trying to
optimize their wealth, although even there paradoxes abound (cf.
[CookL, HagelR]).  In general settings, though, human behavior is hard
to model.  There are nontransitivities in preferences, choices are
determined by behavior of others (so a person is more likely to see a
movie that colleagues have seen to have something to talk to them
about), and so on.  Companies collect extensive data from test
marketing, but that data is noisy, and typically involves only small
variations in test parameters.  There seems to be no unambiguous
empirical demonstration that a well defined demand curve exists.  Thus
economic models discussed above do indicate that bundling is likely to
be advantageous to producers, but do not prove this.
What happens in the real marketplace, with a variety of customers and
competitors, and where there is already much experience with a variety
of marketing plans?  What we see there is extensive evidence of
bundling.  In many situations, such as that of physical newspapers,
there is an obvious motivation for bundling to reduce costs.  However,
there is also evidence of bundling's success when there are
practically no physical costs involved.  Software suites such as
Microsoft Office are just one example.  Cable TV does not charge for
each channel separately, but for packages (bundles) of them.  Finally,
the big and profitable online information services in the financial
and legal arena, such as Reuters, Bloomberg, and Lexis, all operate on
a subscription basis or appear to be moving in that direction.  (The
"pay-per-view" approach made more sense when the computing
infrastructure for online access was expensive, and therefore there
were high marginal costs of providing access.)  All this evidence
confirms that bundling is likely to be common in ecommerce.
3.2 Differential pricing
Charging different prices to different consumers is already common.
Various senior citizen or student discount programs are just some of
the most widely spread practices.  Scholarly journals typically charge
much higher prices to libraries than to individuals, sometimes 10
times higher.  For a thorough discussion of such price discrimination
and its economic and legal status, see the survey [Varian2].  A
producer would like to charge according to the consumer's willingness
to pay, but the consumer will usually be reluctant to reveal such
information.  However, it is sometimes possible to correlate
willingness to pay with other features.  Airlines offer much cheaper
tickets for those willing to be away from home on Saturday night.  The
theory is that business travelers, who are willing to pay a lot, will
not be willing to put up with such inconvenience.  In information
services, online services such as Prodigy and CompuServe offer stock
market quotes that are delayed by 15 or 20 minutes for no extra cost,
beyond the basic subscription.  Real-time quotes uniformly cost extra,
on the theory that those who need them for their trading will pay
more.  The software industry relies on differential pricing in many
products.  Student or demo versions typically are the same as the main
product, except for artificial limitations on what they can do.  They
either cannot produce large executables, or cannot handle large files,
or cannot use extended precision.  We are likely to see many more
examples of such differential pricing.  Electronic publications may
offer high-resolution versions at one price, a lower-resolution
version at a lower one, and sometimes they might offer a fax-quality
version at no charge.  There are already interesting experiments going
on in book distribution, with authors making some parts of their
manuscripts freely available on the Internet, to advertise their work,
to update it with lists of current errata, and to make available
features that draw on the unique capabilities of the electronic
medium.  There are also likely to be differentials based on
timeliness, as with stock market quotes; old issues might be offered
at low or no charge.  There might be extra charges for links to cited
works or other desirable features.
Differences in quality of offered products might be the only way to
preserve some of the features of public libraries.  In the digital
realm, without some artificial barriers, there would be practically no
difference between buying and borrowing.  Hence the traditional
library policy of unrestricted lending is not compatible with
ecommerce, and we are likely to see artificial barriers.  Databases
might be available to library customers but only inside the library,
at special terminals, for example.  Librarians would then have to
become gatekeepers, restricting access to material more than making it
freely available.
3.3 Subscription vs.  pay-per-view
Offering access to a database or a movie channel on a subscription
basis is a form a bundling.  The alternative is to charge for each
movie, or each download of a Web page.  There is much discussion of
how such "a la carte" shopping might become prevalent.  One attraction
of programs consisting of small applets that can be downloaded on
demand appears to be the perception that this would allow producers to
charge according to how frequently the software is used.  However,
past experience with pay-per-view systems has been discouraging.
Except for a few events, such as championship boxing matches, they
have not succeeded in attracting much revenue.  All the arguments in
favor of bundling apply, and suggest that pay-per-view systems will
not be common.  Furthermore, there are additional arguments, supported
by empirical data on consumer behavior, that argue against
pay-per-view schemes.  Consumers appear to have a strong predilection
for reducing risk, even when this predilection results in lower than
optimal expected financial payoff.  A certain $10 gain is usually
preferred to a wager with a 90% chance of winning $15, and a 10%
chance of losing $20.  People also tend to use small deductibles when
purchasing fire or casualty insurance, even when they could easily
bear the loss from a larger deductible.  (Since few insurance
companies operate with an overhead of less than 30%, a larger
deductible would almost surely lead to savings in the long run.)
Similarly, consumers appear to have a strong preference for
subscription services.  To a large extent this is probably explainable
by general risk aversion.  I may prefer to pay a higher price for a
word processor now, even if I do not need it much, to have free use of
it when I lose my job, and need to send out lots of job applications,
but will not be able to afford extra charges.  This preference for
subscription services is present even among librarians, who are not
spending their own money, and with a large number of users of their
resources might be expected to have a stable usage pattern.  Even so,
they have often expressed their unease about paying "a la carte" for
access to databases, since they feared they could not predict what
this would do to their budgets.  It is difficult to quantify the
strength of this preference for subscription services, but it exists
and is strong.  In the 1970s, the Bell System first experimented with
charging for local calls.  Typically, customers were given a choice of
the traditional flat rate option, which might cost $7.50 per
month, and allow unlimited local calling, and of a measured rate option, which might cost $5.00 per month, allow for 50 calls at no
extra charge, and then cost $0.05 per call.  Anyone making fewer than
100 local calls per month would be better off with the measured rate
option.  However, in the numerous trials that were carried out, typically
around 50% of the customers who were making almost no local calls at
all, and thus would benefit from measured rate service, still stayed with the more expensive flat rate service.  The preference for flat rate pricing for Internet access is another example of this phenomenon.
The main conclusion to be drawn from this discussion is that
subscription services do offer substantial value to consumers, even if
that value may seem to be irrational.  As a corollary, they also offer
value to producers.  People are willing to pay a lot just to be able
to occasionally use certain features.  Software producers complain
about all the heavy users of their products who do not pay for their
high usage.  However, these producers benefit from the many users who
hardly ever use their system.  I seldom use Microsoft Word, but when I
do use it (typically because somebody sends me a Word document), I do
need it, and so am willing to purchase it for just such occasions.
Hence we can expect that even if large systems consisting of
downloadable applets do become practical, they will be available on a
subscription, and not on a per-use basis.
3.4 Site licensing
Site licensing, in which a company or a university pays a flat fee to
allow everyone in that institution to use some program or access a
database, is very common in the computer and online information
industries.  In some forms, it has been present for a long time in
other areas as well.  For example, scholarly publishing can be thought
of as an example of site licensing.  Typically a university will buy a
single copy of an esoteric journal, which is then placed in a library,
to be consulted by anyone on campus.
In software, site licensing has many attractive features.  It
simplifies the enforcement problem (which is nontrivial, since many
corporations report they spend more on policing software use than on
the purchase of that software).  It also encourages new users to try
out a package, and thus stimulates more usage.  In addition, though,
site licensing has a strong direct economic argument behind it.  We
can think of site licensing as a variant of bundling.  In ordinary
bundling, a producer assembles together several goods into a bundle,
to smooth out the differences in valuations that individual consumers
place on those goods.  In site licensing, a producer assembles
together a group of consumers to smooth out the differences in
valuations that different people place on a single product.  As an
example, suppose that in a company of 1,000 employees, 900 are totally
uninterested in a software package, but 10 feel it is worth paying $10
for it, 10 feel it is worth $20, and so on, up to 10 who feel it is
worth $100.  If the software manufacturer had to sell copies of the
package to individuals, the best price would be either $50 or $60 for
a copy, and the revenue in either case would be $3,000.  However, if
the management of the company has an accurate impression of how much
the employees value the product, it should be willing to pay $5,500
for a site license.  This would be a much better deal for the
producer, even though it would bring in only $5.50 for each person
entitled to use the product.  Hence we can expect further spread
of site licensing.
4.  Fairness, legality, and efficiency
Economic arguments show that there is value to many of the artificial
barriers in commerce.  It is value not just to producers of the goods
and services, but to society.  Moreover, the incentives to create such
barriers apply to individuals as well as large corporations.  If Alice
plays the piano, and Bob performs magic tricks, they might be able to
obtain higher income by bundling their services through offering a
combined act to nightclubs.  The result might be the difference
between starvation and relative comfort.  In ecommerce, a group of
budding poets might collect larger revenues if they sell access to
their combined works, instead of working individually.
While economics will lead to the creation of barriers in ecommerce,
this will frequently clash with popular notions of what is fair.
There is already much grumbling about airline pricing and senior
citizen discounts.  Moreover, many of the grumbles result in laws
restricting commerce.  Several cities in the United States have passed
laws decreeing that women's shirts should not cost more to launder
than men's.  There is a general perception of what is fair, often
codified into laws.  Some of it goes back to the ancient notion of a
"just price," which is supposed to reflect a modest markup over the
producer's costs.  However, in ecommerce, even more than in the modern
physical economy, cost is a poorly defined concept.
In ecommerce, the concepts of "increasing returns" [Arthur], in which
producer profits increase as usage increases, and customer lock-in, in
which someone trained in using a particular spreadsheet faces a major
barrier of retraining in switching to another one, are the ruling
ones.  This means that the standard tests of illegal monopolistic
behavior do not apply.  It can make excellent sense to give away a
software package, since the major benefit to the producer will come
from sales of upgrades.  Other examples of economically sensible
behavior that is not accepted by society exist.  U. S. courts stopped
IBM from requiring users of its tabulating machines to purchase their
punched cards from IBM [US1936].  Today, most economists would argue
that this decision was a mistake, since in effect what IBM was
attempting to do was to charge the heavy users more than the light
ones, to enlarge the market.  (See [Stigler] for economic arguments
against another decision, [US1962], which barred movie distributors
from requiring movie theaters to book whole series of movies instead
of selecting them individually.)  While the general issue of what
practices are legal is not entirely clear (cf.  [Bowman, Varian2]),
there may be legal problems with some of the barriers that are likely
to be erected.  Even when there is no legal difficulty, there can be
extensive public action, as in recent protests against pharmaceutical
firms' pricing, and against use of child labor in less developed
countries.  (With reputations, whether of celebrity endorsers or
producers themselves, becoming increasingly important, public protests
can be powerful weapons.)  Issues of fairness (see [Zajac] for
extensive discussions of their influence on public policy) are likely
to be much more pronounced than in the past.  One reason is that the
barriers on the electronic superhighway are likely to be frequent.
Another is that those barriers will be much more visible as
artificial.  (In print book publishing, most people seem to think that
hardcover books sell for more than paperbacks because they cost more
to produce.  However, the differences in costs are minor, and the
price difference is just a form of price discrimination.  On the Web,
it will be clear that a low resolution version of a work is just a
degraded version of the high resolution one.)  It will also be much
easier to organize protest movements than in the past.
Public perceptions of what is fair depend on culture, are often
inconsistent, and do often clash with economic incentives.
Furthermore, the rapid evolution of technology, markets, and laws,
will lead to a continuation of the unstable situation we have.
Therefore there will likely be increasing temptation to ask
governments to intervene, and that will produce serious difficulties
for ecommerce.  Barlow's "independence declaration" [Barlow] might
appeal to many, but is totally unrealistic.  Government has been
involved in setting up the Internet, and is getting more involved all
the time, through issues such as the fair use of Scientology documents
on the Net, assignments of names, and provision of wide access to the
Net. The U. S. Telecommunications Act of 1996, which nominally
deregulated telecommunications, also brought in extremely intrusive
government regulations, to deal with thorny issues of setting up a
"level playing field."  We should be prepared for more intervention of
this type, whether they are successful or not.
Many issues will be complex.  As an example, only a tiny fraction of
the public understood any of the arguments about the U. S.
telecommunications deregulation debate, with its technical points
about access to local wires.  Also, few people follow the details of
the debate about revisions to copyright laws.  As was argued in an
earlier section, ecommerce requires some revision.  However, there are
a variety of ways to do this, and the precise ways in which different
proposals affect different players is not clear to the public.  (See
the discussions by Samuelson [Samuelson1, Samuelson2] of the proposed
revisions to U. S. copyright law [USPTO1995], as well as the survey
paper [Okerson] and the book [PattersonL].)  Therefore we can expect
an increased demand for lobbyists, lawyers, and public relations
experts.  Even in the non-governmental arena, it is reported, for
example, that "in preparing a commemorative CD-ROM for the 500th
anniversary of the first Columbus voyage to America, IBM spent over
$1M clearing rights, of which only about $10K went to the rights
holders; everything else went into administrative and legal fees"
[Lesk].  Although systems are being developed for automatic tracking
of rights to copyrighted material and the automatic payment of fees,
it is unlikely that such systems will see wide usage.  Content
owners will probably be reluctant to rely on them, and possibly
let valuable rights slip away.  The conclusion to be drawn from this essay is that electronic
commerce will increase the efficiency of the economy.  However, it will also create artificial barriers, and we will have to learn
to live with them.

Notes on organizing conferences
Phil Agre
August 1996
This article is adapted from the post mortem that I write immediately
after organizing the 1994 CPSR Annual Meeting, together with notes to
myself from other meetings I have been involved in organizing.  Its
purpose is to offer future organizers the benefit of our experience.
I accepted the job of program chair because I wanted to develop my skills
for organizing events, and I definitely learned some things along the way.
One thing I learned is apparently very subtle, since I've never seen or
heard of anybody explaining it.  The professional world has a special way
of defining identity: people are identified with issues.  When I started
planning the program, my initial approach was simply to start with the
most dynamic individuals in the general area that CPSR covers.  So I sent
out a batch of e-mail messages to well-connected personages, asking them
who we should get to speak.  Alas, few of them were able to say anything
very useful, saying (usually in a nice way) that they regarded my request
as overly vague.  I gather that one is supposed to decide first what
issues to cover, and then ask who is associated with that issue.  For
example, "who are some good people to speak on the political aspects
of building community networks?"  Or, "who is a good person to speak on
technology activism on issues affecting people with disabilities?"  This
is nearly the only form of question I could get answered.  Even a simple
variant like, "who has something fresh and original to say about topic X?"
didn't work very well.  It's as though everyone maintains a lookup table
in their heads, indexing people to issues.
Having started this way, some other problems then arise.  Sometimes you
can't get the number one speaker on a given issue to speak, so then you
ask who else you might get, and you'll get some more names.  It's good
to ask whether so-and-so is a good speaker or not.  Sometimes you'll hear
someone say something bad (or something diplomatically irrelevant) about
a potential speaker whom you haven't met, and such comments will probably
weigh heavily with you, for the simple reason that it's a disaster to
schedule an unskilled or irresponsible speaker on your program.  This
dynamic bothered me, since it seemed to have a built-in tendency to
reinforce a single individual's standing even though other people might
be equally talented; if someone already has a reputation as a speaker
in a given area, those other people don't get invited to speak, so they
can't develop reputations as speakers.  I had a certain amount of success
asking, "who deserves a chance to be heard on this issue?", and some
people even volunteered the names of people who they felt deserved a
chance.  This made me feel better.
Start early.  You need to get your publicity out in time for monthly
publications listing in their schedule.  I don't know when precisely this
is, since we didn't come close to making the deadline.  I didn't start
the publicity machinery for our October conference until we had every last
speaker pinned down in early summer.  Big mistake: people go on vacation
in the summer, and your rate of progress in assembling the program will
plummet starting in late June.  Identify your prominent, featured speakers
and get them pinned down first; they're the only ones you need to get your
publicity under way.  I found e-mail seductive; it's easy to publicize
something to the whole net in a few days, so I conveniently forgot that
large parts of the world don't read announcements on the net -- print
publicity is still absolutely necessary.
We had a professional PR person working for us.  She works at UCSD in the
PR office.  She's perfectly good at her job, but I've learned some lessons
for working with such people in the future.  One is to clarify goals.
My central goal was to get a lot of interesting people to attend our
meeting; this meant PR aimed at obtaining advance publicity.  UCSD's main
goal, though, was to get lots of press coverage on the day of the meeting
itself; this meant PR aimed at getting reporters to attend the meeting.
These two goals are equally valid, but they happen on different schedules.
Local advance publicity mostly happened in the three or four days before
the meeting, and with a little effort we did well.
We made some mistakes in the meeting brochure.  One was that the brochure
only mentioned the three main speakers, even though it had room for
much more.  This might not have been so bad, except that the three-line
summaries of those three speakers' speeches all sounded pretty similar.  I
have no way of knowing how much difference this made to the final turnout,
but I do think we should have taken more conscious care to identify broad
categories of people we wanted in attendance, and then making sure each
one sees something on the brochure that they find appealing.  When this
problem came up, we made a single-page (front and back of a green sheet of
paper) version of the electronic meeting announcement, including the full
program and registration information.  We ended up distributing hundreds
of these, and I am sure that they gave lots of people a good idea of what
the organization is about.
I made some mistakes when booking the speakers for the meeting.  I don't
regret any of the people we chose, though I ended up disagreeing with
a couple of them much more intensely than I had thought I would.  The
problem was with financial matters.  We had a $500-per-speaker budget for
people who were coming from outside California, so we had to minimize the
number of such people.  The problem is that some speakers simply cannot
attend for $500, since their travel expenses simply cannot be covered for
$500.  My response to this problem was denial: I just got vague and hoped
it would go away.  But of course it didn't.  Some speakers took losses
despite my clear statement of the $500 limit, and I should have been even
clearer with them that they should book flights etc right away to ensure
that their losses are not greater than they're happy with.  The reason
I didn't do these things was that I was focused on getting the people
to accept our invitations, especially in one case where our first choice
declined after weeks of hemming and hawing.  (If you're invited to speak
at a conference, please decide whether to accept right away.)
One thing we did right was to send out a press release.  The UCSD PR
person wrote it.  I thought that the press release, like all of the press
coverage, tended to trivialize things with buzzwords like "access to the
information superhighway".  But I was repeatedly assured that that's how
it is: you have to use words that people understand.  Anyway, we sent
our press release out on PR Newswire, and I mailed it to all of the local
computer press.  I also mailed it to an eccentric local newspaper that's
distributed free in coffee houses, and they reprinted it verbatim.  I
found that San Diego has all kinds of free publications that I hadn't even
heard of, including something called Terminal Velocity that's aimed at the
cyberculture and comics crowd -- 40,000 circulation.  Not to be sneezed at.
One issue was the phone number to use in the press release -- where should
people call for more information about the meeting?  At first I used the
CPSR number in Palo Alto since nobody here wanted to field a million phone
calls.  But this was a mistake.  Lots of people don't want to call long
distance, and once I broke down and started listing my own office phone
number, I only got a couple dozen calls, including several calls from very
interesting people.  The only category of calls that bothered me was from
people wanting technical help with their computers.  Most of these calls
were easy enough, since I could send them to local user groups, but one
of them was extremely obnoxious.  On the whole, being the contact person
listed in these publications was a far more positive experience than I
thought it would be.
Another thing we did right was outreach.  This was a principle of the
meeting from the beginning.  Think of the meeting as primarily an occasion
for organizing.  Call people on the phone, tell them about the meeting,
and ask them who you should be speaking with.  At the very beginning of
the process, write a small announcement of the meeting and invite people
to become involved and sent it out on the net; we got some excellent
contacts this way.  The Internet may not reach the masses yet, but we
found that San Diego now has a pretty reasonable density of Internet
penetration among computer people.  Announcements about CPSR events here
have reached all sorts of interesting people by being passed hand-to-hand
through the net.  We made dozens of phone calls along the way: computer
user groups, Latino organizations, city government, political activists,
commercial Internet providers, BBS operators, industry people, and so
forth.  People have heard about the "info highway", so your job is to get
your message boiled down to something that sounds like your interlocutor's
next step on their way to the net.  Don't try to "sell" your organization
or issue to someone who's not interested; rather, if they're already
interested in the issues then make the meeting process tangible for them.
We visited a number of computer user group meetings; I also called up the
organizers of several such meetings and asked if they would be willing to
announce the Annual Meeting, and sent them copies of the aforementioned
"green sheet" schedule.
Early on in the process, I organized a speaker series that Dave Noelle did
good publicity for, making posters and sending them to various people and
publications.  Since the first speaker's topic was privacy, the "Reader"
(free weekly tabloid) decided to feature her talk, and their article drew
a few dozen people.  We also sent the announcements out on the Internet,
and each talk had at least a couple dozen people.  At the beginning of
each talk, I introduced myself and told people about the conference.
We sent around a sign-up sheet.  We got a bit of a mailing list and some
good contacts from that process, but I cannot swear that it was really
worth all the effort.  Maybe we would have reached those people through
other channels.  The speaker series was intellectually worthwhile though.
The meeting weekend itself was so thoroughly organized, primarily by the
local librarians, that it's hard for me to draw any particular lessons
besides getting good people to do the work.  Typing this now, I can't
think of anything that went wrong that's worth telling you about.
Oh yes.  We got screwed by the student center, whose new management
decided that she wasn't interested in honoring the agreement we had made
with her predecessor.  Of course we didn't have it in writing, because
we had been assured that we didn't *need* to have it in writing.  After I
grouched at her a while, she told us that she would "honor your agreement"
by charging us 2.5 times what that agreement had called for.  I flipped
out and decided that we would move the meeting to an engineering lecture
hall that I could book for free because I'm a professor.  But hey -- if I
wasn't a professor then we could have been shafted.  So remember, get it
in writing.  No matter what conversations you've had with them, they've
always got more rules printed on sheets of paper that you've never heard
about.  You can't enforce your agreements until they're written down.
And beware of those extra little charges.  We were told that the banquet
would cost $X per person, but when the paperwork finally arrived, that
turned out to mean $X plus tax and gratuity plus a $400 "facility fee".
(I then got this infuriatingly condescending little speech to the effect
that this is a standard industry practice -- i.e., everyone does it --
and that I must therefore not know what I'm doing.  But setting out to
take revenge about such things will probably not serve your real goals.)
Get it in writing.
In doing the early outreach, I had to learn some lessons.  I know that
it's good to consult people: call them, visit them, tell them what you're
doing, and say "what advice do you have for me?".  This makes friends for
you and the organization and makes people feel included.  It also prevents
you from being perceived as grabbing someone else's turf -- that is,
claiming sovereignty over an issue that someone else has invested effort
identifying themselves with already.  Often the people you talk to will
actually have good advice for you.  (If they have an agenda or an axe then
you can usually figure out what it is and steer around it.)  Find out who
knows people and approach them this way.  They don't have to be obvious
allies.  Even people who specialize in elite networking in your city are
perfectly good candidates for this, though you should pick the highest
status individual in your organizing group to approach such people.  A
professor of any rank will do fine.  Get rid of your political jargon.
Be able to talk to people in language they can understand.  Evolve a bunch
of honest ways of explaining what the meeting is about.  If you cannot
come up with an honest way of explaining your meeting to someone then that
person is not part of your audience.  If they *ought* to be part of your
audience then you need to go back and redesign the meeting.
Anyway, this cycle of asking advice sometimes became clumsy when I was
speaking with someone who wanted to be a speaker at the meeting.  It's
hard to invite someone to participate in a meeting and simultaneously
tell them they can't speak at the meeting.  So decide ahead of time which
people might want to be speakers, and what you'll say when they explicitly
ask you to put them on the program.  The standard response is to hide
behind your program committee, saying "that would be great, I'll take
it up with the program committee".  But a lot of people don't buy that.
So you won't always end up on perfectly positive terms with people.
One way you can be helpful to people is to explicitly invite them to make
their organization's (or company's, or whatever) literature available on
the conference literature tables.  We had several books and journals being
advertised, along with several nonprofit Internet providers and local
computer organizations.  I'm sure we could have had many more if I had
gotten those literature invitations out earlier.
Anybody who isn't attending your meeting on a corporate expense account
will care a lot about how much it costs.  Make it cheap.  If you work with
professional meeting organizers, or people who are accustomed to the world
of expense accounts, you will have to resist their seemingly inexorable
impulses to make everything "nice" by piling on exotic banquets, racks
of A/V equipment, free notebooks for everyone, hotel rooms for speakers,
nice little selections of juices and cookies at breaks, and so on.  These
people mean well, but you will need to bring them back to fiscal reality
gently, step by step.
Make conscious choices about who should run panels, give opening and
closing remarks, introduce speakers, etc.  We made good choices, but I
wasn't thinking about the issue until very late.
If you have any speakers in wheelchairs, plan way ahead for their housing
and transportation.  Carefully walk the whole path that they will need
to travel from curbside to podium, and make extra sure that the necessary
doors will be unlocked for handicapped access, including bathrooms.
I didn't like the page I wrote about the Annual Meeting for the summer
issue of the CPSR Newsletter.  I *should* have written an advertisement
aimed at turning out the maximum number of CPSR members, most of whom
have had rather little personal contact with the organization and really
do need to be "sold" on the Annual Meeting, which after all requires a
real expenditure of time and money.  Instead I wrote a fancy think piece
about strategy and gave too much attention about our plans to connect to
the local community.  I'm glad that we connected to the local community,
but that was not the major message to emphasize for people from outside
the local community.
We put up a WWW page for the Annual Meeting program and registration.
It was fun, but I have no idea what difference it made.  I *do* know
that it's useless to put up a WWW page unless you advertise it by sending
messages to various mailing lists.
When you're about to choose a date for the meeting, make sure you ask
all of the people who know lots of organizations.  We had an unfortunate
conflict with a AAAS/ABA workshop on cyberspace ethics and law in
Get people together early and brainstorm about the meeting.  People have
lots of great ideas.  Let their ideas influence you so that your thinking
is broadened and you're making your decisions more consciously than you
might be otherwise.
I was glad that we clarified early what jobs the National Office does.
They ended up doing some extra jobs, and we ended up doing pieces of
some things that I had originally been happy to let them do, but clear
assignments of tasks are good.
Draw on the experience of the people who have organized the meeting in
earlier years.  And then when you're done, write down your own experiences
to benefit others.

equal credit discrimination based on race; it may mean credit

correlation with being a member of some races. (I won't go into the
explanations for why this is the case here; most people who try to
explain it don't take enough factors into account.)
factors that people cannot change is something that is wrong. This
topic is wider in its application than redlining and credit; one
example important to me in my field is in genetic screening usage for
insurance purposes. (In that case, you've also got that limits on
insurance uses of data when individuals can gather the data in
question mean that someone can predict their own chances of needing
insurance... leading to those who are healthy not purchasing it,
and those who aren't purchasing it.)
I believe I am among most people in finding a question about my
behavior (e.g, my sexual activities) significantly more intrusive
than a question about my personal characteristics (e.g., my gender).
But I would hope that everyone would agree that it would be idiotic
and irresponsible not to have someone's payments for insurance vary
with their behavior; this would encourage irresponsible behavior and
discourage responsible behavior.
due to factors one cannot change is a fact of life. This is particularly
true of capitalism (e.g., someone who has a genetic tendency toward
large size will consume more food and thus spend more money on food),
but it is also a problem in any other economic system - economics is
not all of life. Even if one concludes that inequality is wrongful and
needs to be "alleviated", there are many areas more important than
credit on which one would logically start... such as forbidding
merit-based admissions, which are biased in favor of those with higher
IQs. I trust that my audience sees exactly why this idea, and similar
ideas, are ultimately nonsense?
proponents of absolute equality is that found in Rawls' _Theory of
Justice_, under which the just outcome is said to be found by a group
of people who do not know what situation they will be in. (This is
a vast oversimplification of the book(s) in question, which upon
closer examination may realize the idea I am about to write down.)
The simplistic conclusion is that everyone will want everything to be
the same, since any individual might be in a bad or good situation. But
if you have a choice between 49 dollars and a 50/50 chance of 0 or 100
dollars, you should take the latter. In other words, a situation in
which inequalities exist can still be one that is overall better than
a fully equal situation. There are a number of respects in which
the insurance and credit markets fall under this category. The most
obvious is the direct cost of regulation. Less obvious but perhaps
more important is the uncertainty factor; the use of more data (for
an insurance or credit decision) leads to less uncertainty in
the ultimate outcome, and thus to less risk of unexpected claims
(for insurance) or defaults (for credit). Thus, smaller businesses
(which are also made more possible by lowering other regulatory
costs) can exist in a deregulated insurance or credit market. The
removal of the current ogliopolistic situation in such markets
for the initial insurance or credit grantor would improve prices.

all of the problem to them an oversimplification. I'd also point out the
cultural factors caused by the development of cultures under uncivilized
(in the sense of lacking cities) and unindustrial conditions, something
that is not helped by the current PC multiculturalist wish to bring such
cultures back. (The reasons for African cultures not developing in this
route are an interesting debate; I find Sowell's argument of lack of
navigable rivers and the presence of various diseases such as malaria
reasonably convincing.) Other factors include the lack of parental
education and nutrition resulting in lower parental IQs resulting in
lower child IQs; interracial adoption, while opposed by the PC types,
is one way to solve this problem. Another factor is lingering racism,
which is regretably still present in subsections of the country.

loans to those who have just graduated is that of headaches in gathering
sufficient information; namely, the cost of finding out "is this a good
school" and "how good are this person's prospects" are sufficiently high so as
to make up for the default rates. As previously mentioned by Dale Thorn,
the inclusion in this figure of various trade schools is also a (related)
problem, one that Clinton's proposal of student loans for 2 years of
college for _everyone_ would make worse.

between a truly descriptive system and such obviously judgemental systems
as SafeSurf. This partially judgemental nature is probably unavoidable in
systems in which one uses a non-binary rating scheme; if the presence of
something inevietably means that the system gives a "high" rating, then
the system is judging that the something is more important than other
factors. In this case, the judgement is pretty obviously that they deem the

stupid) as assuming complete guilt. Moreover, government competition with
the private sector is rarely beneficial; in this particular area, I'd point
out that it isn't reducing the cost of borrowing, it's increasing it - when
lenders can lend to the government, they're _not_ lending to private
businesses and others who can make far better use of the money. This factor,
in a large part, is why most economists are in favor of a reduction in the

Boys Arrested for Plotting Bomb
   NEW YORK (Reuter) - Three 13-year-old boys have been accused of
   plotting to blow up their school after learning how to build a bomb
   over the Internet, police said Friday.
   The boys were arrested Wednesday after other students at Pine Grove
   Junior High School in Minoa, New York, heard rumors of their plans and
   police were alerted, said Capt. William Bleyle of the nearby Manlius
   police department.
   One of the boys, believed to be the ringleader, admitted to police
   that the three eighth graders learned how to build the bomb from
   instructions they found on the Internet, the global network accessible
   from home computers.
   ``The information is very easy to find,'' Bleyle said. ''It's at your
   fingertips. They just called it up.''
   He said police found diesel fuel, a bag of fertilizer and other items
   -- the basic materials to build a bomb-- at the first boy's house.
   The boys found the information using a computer at home, not at
   school, said Gary Minns, superintendent of the East Syracuse-Minoa
   school district, about 250 miles northwest of New York City. The
   school is not hooked up to the Internet but had been considering it,
   he said.
   ``It goes way beyond what we would consider a prank,'' Minns said.
   ``Especially from Oklahoma City and the knowledge and awareness of the
   devastation these things can cause, to think they were even
   considering doing this type of thing is extremely disturbing.''
   The three boys had built and tested a bomb in a field behind an
   elementary school, Bleyle said. That bomb caught fire but did not
   explode. All three, who are being charged as juveniles, are accused of
   conspiracy, he said. They have been suspended from school.
   Police were still investigating their motives, Bleyle said, adding
   ``It was definitely to effect destruction on the school. It was not an
   idle threat. There was actual intent to carry this through. The
   destruction could have been enormous.''

ELECTRONIC PRIVACY RIGHTS AND POLICE POWER
[This is the third of a series of articles discussing privacy rights in
the digital age.]
It's no secret. Law enforcement agents are closely monitoring traffic
on the Internet. It is also no secret that crime is proliferating on
the Internet at a frightening pace. Law enforcement agents are a bit
unnerved as they watch their tried and true methods of law enforcement
become antiquated. However, law enforcement on the Internet is starting
to come of age.
Here are some recent examples:
(1) The Secret Service set up a bogus bulletin board system for the
purpose of attracting people who want to sell stolen cellular phone
codes. Thieves often get these codes by using scanners which pick up
the code-embedded signals emitted from moving cars. The result: six
arrests and seizure of 20 computer systems.
(2) The Justice Department ended a two-year investigation into use of
America Online (AOL) for the distribution of child pornography and
perpetration of other sex-crimes. The result: 125 homes were searched,
computer systems seized and numerous arrests made across the country.
(3) Just this month, the Secret Service noticed that Virtual Visions
( put up a new web page
which shows the heads of public figures such as Bob Dole, Boris Yeltsin
and Bill Gates, slowly exploding. Virtual Visions intended this to be
political satire. The result: the developer of the web page received a
visit from the Secret Service.
The Fourth Amendment -
The objectives of law enforcement and of personal privacy are on a
collision course on the Information Highway. Law enforcement personnel
desire access to as much information as possible to conduct their
investigations. Individuals want to restrict access to personal
information.  It is necessary to achieve a balance between effective
law enforcement and personal privacy. How the Fourth Amendment to the
U.S. Constitution is interpreted will play a crucial role in
determining where this balance is reached.
The 4th Amendment prohibits government agents from conducting
unreasonable searches and seizures. The Supreme Court has defined a
seizure of property as a "meaningful interference with an individual's
possessory interest in that property." The concept of seizure of
information differs dramatically from seizure of tangible property.
Seizure of tangible property means that the owner has been deprived of
the use and possession of the property. Whereas, when information is
"seized" the owner may still have possession of the information.  It is
just that the information has been copied and is now also in the hands
of someone else.
It could be argued that under the Fourth Amendment no seizure occurs
when digital information is merely copied. However, applying the
analysis used to prohibit wiretapping (which has been defined as a
seizure), seizure of information would also fall within the
constitutional definition of seizure.  In the information context,
"seizure" should be interpreted as meaning being deprived of the
ability to control the disclosure and dissemination of the information.
This ability to control is the value of the possessory interest of
The application of the term "search" in the digital environment is more
complicated. An unlawful search requires as a prerequisite that (1)
subjectively, the person in possession of the item searched had an
actual expectation of privacy and (2) objectively, the person had an
expectation of privacy. The subjective expectation of privacy element
has been criticized, because in theory, it would be very easy for the
government to eliminate any expectation of privacy by announcing that
it will perform broad searches.  However, in practice, the Supreme
Court has focused on the objective requirement.
On one end of the spectrum is data resident in a stand-alone computer.
Here, there is certainly an objective expectation of privacy. On the
other end of the spectrum lie the vast open areas of the Internet, such
as web pages and newsgroups to which there can be no objective
expectation of privacy.
Accordingly, law enforcement agents are free to roam through these open
areas, assemble records on who is participating in which groups, and
what they are saying. For example, if the Secret Service wanted to
assemble all the messages that you posted in newsgroups in the last
year (the technology to perform this search available) in order to
determine your political positions, this would not violate the Fourth
The middle ground is where the legal battles will be fought. This will
primarily involve information that is in the possession of a third
party, and is not readily accessible to the public.
Under traditional constitutional analysis, where information is
disclosed to a third party, the expectation of privacy is abandoned.
For example, most state laws, and the federal Constitution, permit
wiretapping if one party to the conversation consents. However, the
scope of the abandonment will usually only apply to the amount of
information needed by the recipient.
For example, the telephone numbers you dial are disclosed to the phone
company in order that the phone company can perform its service.
Thereby, a person abandons the expectation regarding the number
dialed.  However, even though the content of telephone conversations is
also given over to the phone company, this content is not needed for
the phone company to perform its service. Therefore, the content of
phone conversations retains the expectation of privacy.
By analogy, this would also apply to e-mail messages maintained on a
service provider's equipment. Information such as the senders' and
recipients' addresses, the file sizes and times of transmissions are
not private. But the content of the messages would be.
In the workplace, an employer is not permitted to consent to a search
of personal areas of an employee. For example, a desk draw that
contains personal correspondence. By accepted convention, this is a
private area.
Private network directories which require a password to enter would
probably also retain an expectation of privacy. However, in each case,
a court will look at specific corporate policies to determine whether
there is an objective expectation of privacy or whether the employee
was informed that the employer may at any time without notice enter
these pass-worded directories.
Along these lines, since a court wants to determine the objective
expectation of privacy, an agreement that an employer will not consent
to a search would have no effect. What would be needed is an agreement
that the employer will not access these private areas, which deprives
the employer of the right to consent.
When determining the objective expectation privacy, courts will have to
balance the value of the particular privacy interest claimed against
the level of the law enforcement interest.  Only this month, America
Online under subpoena turned over personal e-mail records relating to a
criminal investigation where the murderer allegedly met the victim in
an AOL chat room. AOL has been criticized for not challenging the
subpoena. AOL's position is that if it receives a search warrant, it
will comply. This case highlights the valid competing interests of both
law enforcement and personal privacy.

won't vote for someone picked out of the phone book, but what if the
predicted individual is a doctor who performs abortions, or an activist for
gay rights (or *against* gay rights), or Bill Gates ;-).  There are also
the individuals who are trying to bring about change in society that is
unpopular, but is still in the interest of humanity.  Abraham Lincoln
surely would have been killed by this system, for example.  Also, big
corporations would be able to cut down their political enemies such as
envornment activists, fair business practice activists and competetors'
high ranking officers.  Even if only one person in charge of such a
business were to put out a digital contract, he would have no problem
suppling the money for the hit.  People who have tried to make changes for
humanity that went against the social norm at the time are revered today
for their efforts.  In this system, they would likely be assasinated.
Nothing would ever change because people are always afraid of change and
afraid of things they do not understand and the people who fight that
ignorance will likely be killed.  Your statement that Organization B, the
one that collects for any target, is not well supported.  They would still
be doing *plenty* of business, in spite of the higher prices.
Actually, the involvement of wealth instead of votes (the first can be lost,
the second cannot) is an argument in _favor_ of Assasination Politics. I
generally have the objection to most anarcho-capitalist systems that the
average person does not have enough foresight to do the kind of banding
together most of them require. This one has the advantage of increased power to
the wealthy, who have enough foresight to gain their wealth (or at least
keep it, in the case of inheritance).

claim they're just following the law, is in the end the deciding factor in how
they behave. In other words, each person must decide what rights exist. If that

something about the rights-violator - to stop them at the bare minimum.
Solutions which also serve the functions of justice (retribution) and
discouragement are optimal.
way they did. It also prevents any chance of repentance or growth. It also
leaves any question of a mistake moot. I personaly don't want to live in a
society where by any stretch of the imagination some group of strangers
decide if I live or die. This is ultimately the basic human right. If you
seriously support this then it is unreasonable for you to support freedom of
speech and the elimination of federal intrusions into it. Killing a person
is a very effective method to silence speech. If it is a right then no
amount of people are sufficient to take it from you. I don't want my
great-great-great-grandchildren to live in that kind of world either.
the evidence tends to be pretty clear... and those tend to be the ones in which
the person thinks they're justified, or claims as much. These tend to be
the governmental cases. Regarding restrictions of rights, if someone
violates the rights of another, it is right to take away (permanently or
temporarily) some of their rights. First, it is necessary in order to prevent
further violations - a variety of self-defense. Second, it is just retribution.
Third, the manner of such punishment may be chosen to serve as a
discouragement; while it would not be right to chose to punish someone on this
basis alone, one may consider it when deciding on details.
someone's rights in self-defense? Shooting them for trying to kill you
definitely prevents their speech, for instance. The concept in question is
just a temporally altered version.
I disagree strongly with this. Historicaly those gang members have risen to
become the government. It occurs often enough to clearly indicate that
groups in concert tend to behave the same way toward outsiders. It is a
function of human psychology.
government. They can be divided into two basic groups; the ones who believe in
a cause, and the ones who just want power. The first can only be stopped by
death when their cause is wrong, although if the cause itself is not wrong but
their method of gaining it is, they should be discouragable from using certain
methods. The second are quite discouragable - they don't have much power when
they're dead.
Whose justice? The victims? Does it bring them justice or just ease your
feelings of threat? Would you feel justified? I would feel guilty being
involved in any manner with the death of another human being. For me, life
is the ultimate treasure (hoaky as that may be), no body irrispective of
quantity is wise enough to decide that question in any situation. away from the rights of another, it is balanced to take away that first
person's rights to compensate. They caused another to lose freedom; now they
will have their freedom limited.
A democracy consists of groups acting in concert in various sizes toward a
quasi-shared mental model. The majority rule is a basic tenent of government
theory. The current system says 12 people are sufficient to decide a persons
life. Is 12 strangers sufficient to decide your life? I don't think they are
sufficient to decide mine.

   LONDON (Feb 12, 1996 11:23 a.m. EST) -- Motorola Inc. said it won two
   contracts to supply microchips for smart cards that will be used by
   the governments of Spain and the Czech Republic to administer benefit
   programs.
   The cards are credit-card sized devices incorporating
   specially-designed memory chips, called microcontrollers. They have a
   growing number of applications and can be used instead of cash in
   stores, at telephone booths, for pay-television and computer-shopping.
   The largest demand, though, will come from government agencies, like
   Spain's Social Security Administration and the Czech Republic's
   Healthcare Ministry. China, with a population of 1.2 billion, is
   considering a national identification card using this technology, said
   Waqar Qureshi, Motorola worldwide marketing manager for smart-card
   chips.
   Spain has ordered 7 million microprocessors, valued at more than $10
   million, from Motorola in the first phase of a nationwide program that
   could grow to 40 million cards. The chips will store the digitized
   description of the holders' fingerprints, which should help to reduce
   fraud.
   "The smart cards will enable multiple transactions with the Social
   Security to be carried out in a more secure manner and their use can
   easily be extended to other services," said a spokesman for the
   Spanish Social Security Ministry, quoted in a Motorola statement.
   In the Czech Republic, Motorola is supplying 10,000 chips for a pilot
   health-insurance program in the Litomerice region. A countrywide
   health-card project for 10 million people is planned for introduction
   starting in 1997.
   "These two contracts, valued at tens of millions of dollars, are prime
   examples of the growing trend among governments across the world to
   look at smartcard solutions in the administration of public social
   services and benefits," said Allan Hughes, Motorola's worldwide
   smartcard manager.
   Visa Spain said in December it would launch smart cards to replace the
   use of cash for transactions as small as buying a pack of cigarettes.
   With software written in Spanish that already is being used in Miami,
   Colombia and Argentina, Visa Spain said it intends to place as many as
   3 million "Visa Cash" cards a year in circulation in Spain this year.

reports on a Pentagon study on how the military can exploit the Internet.
The Pentagon paper suggests using the Internet for the routine interception
of global e-mail, for covert operations and propaganda campaigns, and for
tracking domestic political activity, particularly that of the left. The

By David Corn
 Internet users beware; Pentagon snoops are taking an interest in your
cyber-communications. Last summer, Charles Swett, a policy assistant in the
Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and
Low-Intensity Conflict, produced a report  that assessed the intelligence
value of the Internet for the Defense Department. His study discovered the
obvious: By monitoring computer message traffic and alternative news sources
from around the world, the military might catch "early warning of impending
significant developments." Swett reports that the "Internet could also be
used offensively as an additional medium in psychological operations
campaigns and to help achieve unconventional warfare objectives." A striking
aspect of his study is that there is one sort of Internet user who attracts a
large amount of attention from Swett: cyber-smart lefties.
   The thirty-one-page, unclassified study is mostly cut and dry. Much of it
describes what the Internet is and what can be found within its infinite
confines. Swett lists various "fringe groups" that are exploiting the
Internet: the white-supremacist National Alliance, the Michigan Militia,
Earth First, and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). He
highlights MUFON--the Mutual UFO Network--which uses the Internet to
disseminate information on "U.S. military operations that members believe
relate to investigations and cover-ups of UFO-related incidents." MUFON
computer messages, Swett notes, "contain details on MUFON's efforts to
conduct surveillance of DoD installations." The report does not suggest that
the computer communications of MUFON and these other groups should be
targeted by the military--though X Filers will be forgiven for wondering if
something sinister is afoot.
   What Swett apparently finds of greater interest than MUFON and the "fringe
groups" is the online left. A significant portion of the report is devoted to
the San Francisco-based Institute for Global Communications, which operates
several computer networks, such as PeaceNet and EcoNet, that are used by
progressive activists. I.G.C. demonstrates, he writes, "the breadth of
DoD-relevant information available on the Internet." The paper refers to
I.G.C. conferences that might be considered noteworthy by the Pentagon,
including ones on anti-nuclear arms campaigns, the extreme right, social
change, and "multicultural, multi-racial news." Swett cites I.G.C. as the
home for "alternative news sources" that fill gaps in the mainstream media.
(It might be good for Pentagon analysts to read I.G.C. dispatches from
Holland's Peace Media Service.) Yet he seems to say that one can  also track
the left around the world by monitoring I.G.C.: "Although [I.G.C.] is clearly
a left-wing political organization, without actually joining I.G.C. and
reading its message traffic, it is difficult to assess the nature and extent
of its members' actual real-world activities."
 Swett's paper presents the world of opportunity awaiting a cyber-shrewd
military and intelligence establishment. The Pentagon and intelligence
services will conduct "routine monitoring of messages originating in other
countries" in the search for information on "developing security threats."
That means overseas e-mail, like overseas phonecalls, will be intercepted by
the electronic eavesdroppers of the National Security Agency or some other
outfit. The data will be fed into filtering computers and then, if it
contains any hot-button words, forwarded to the appropriate analyst.
"Networks of human sources with access to the Internet could be developed in
areas of security concern to the U.S." (But bureaucrats rest assured; "this
approach"--using computer-assisted spies--"could never replace official DoD
intelligence collection systems or services.") The Internet "can also serve
counterintelligence purposes" by identifying threats to the Pentagon and U.S.
intelligence activities. As an example, Swett refers to a message posted in a
discussion group for "left-wing political activists" that repeated an A.P.
article about an upcoming U.S. Army Special Operations Command training
exercise at an empty Miami Beach hotel.
 Another growth area is the dirty tracks department. Noting that government
officials, military officials, business people, and journalists all around
the world are online, Swett envisions "Psychological Operations" campaigns in
which U.S. propaganda could be rapidly disseminated to a wide audience. He
adds, "The U.S. might be able to employ the Internet offensively to help
achieve unconventional warfare objectives." Swett does not delve into details
on how the Internet could serve such a mission. But he tosses out one
possibility: communicating via the Internet with political and paramilitary
groups abroad that Washington wants to assist while "limiting the direct
political involvement of the United States." Imagine this: contras with
 Swett does point to a few potential problems. The Internet is chockful of
chit-chat of no intelligence value. Retrieving useful nuggets will require
monumental screening. He also predicts that one day video footage of military
operations will be captured by inexpensive, hand-held digital video cameras
operated by local individuals and then up-loaded to the Internet. Within
minutes, millions of people around the world will see for themselves what has
happened--which could lead to calls for action (or calls to terminate action)
before government leaders have had a chance to react and formulate a
position. Such a development, he observes, "will greatly add to the burden on
military commanders, whose actions will be subjected to an unprecedented
degree of scrutiny." And opponents of the Pentagon might try to exploit the
Internet for their own devilish ends: "If it became widely known that DoD
were monitoring Internet traffic for intelligence or counterintelligence
purposes,  individuals with personal agendas or political purposes in mind,
or who enjoy playing pranks, would deliberately enter false or misleading
messages." The study ends with a series of vague recommendations--all to be
carried out "only in full compliance with the letter and the spirit of the
law, and without violating the privacy of American citizens."  The Swett paper is "refreshingly candid," says Steven Aftergood of the
Federation of American Scientists, who placed a copy of the document on the
FAS web site on government secrecy, where it is being downloaded about twenty
times a day (at   The I.G.C. staff is
amused by Swett's interest. "We must be doing something right," notes George
Gundrey, program coordinator of I.G.C.'s PeaceNet. "But it is interesting
that all of his [I.G.C.] examples are the most left-wing items [on the
network]."  Swett's study is not the first of its kind. Under the rubric of "information
warfare," other Pentagon outfits and military contractors have studied how to
use computer networks to collect public information, disseminate propaganda,
politically destabilize other governments, and plant computer viruses into
the information systems of foes. (The latter task is particularly foolhardy.
Deploying viruses into cyber-space--even if targeted against an enemy--would
likely pose a danger to the United States, since this country is more
networked than any other.) But Swett's office--the Pentagon's dirty tricks
shop--is a newcomer to this scene, acoording to David Banisar, a policy
analyst for the Electronic Privacy Information Center. Banisar's group has
been helping international human rights groups use encryption to protect
their global e-mai, "so the spooks don't listen in"
 It is natural that the national security gang will try to infiltrate and use
a communication medium like the Internet to its advantage. What is most
troubling about Swett's paper is its preoccupation with left-of-center
travelers in cyberspace and _domestic_ political activities. In the appendix,
Swett reproduces four examples of notable e-mail. One (written by progressive
activists Richard Cloward and Frances Fox Piven) calls for 100 days of
protest in response to the Republican's Contract with America, another
announces plans for a demonstration at the 1996 G.O.P. convention in San
Diego, the third relays to lefties information on the U.S. Army exercise at
the Miami Beach hotel, and the last is a communique from the Zapatistas of
Mexico. Swett's use of these cyber dispatches can be explained one of two
ways. Either the left has made much more progress in cyber-organizing than
the right and "such fringe groups" as PETA, or Swett, true to institutional
tradition, is overwrought about the use of the Internet by a certain parties.
In any case, the would-be watchers in the defense establishment ought to be
watched closely--especially if Swett's report refelcts broader sentiment
within the Pentagon.

"Multiple very thin flexible hollow tubes (1 mm ID? teflon?) filled with a
homogenous liquid explosive (for example, pure nitromethane), length accurately cut to produce the exactly desired delay.  Kept separated from each other by foam spacers to avoid inter-fiber detonations. Detonated from a single cap, with an intermediary chamber of liquid explosive to stabilize the shock front, the detonation wave travels along each tube simultaneously at (presumably) identical velocity."
It's a race, designed so that the detonation waves reach their targets (the
foci) at the same time.  If the detonation velocity was, say, 5,000 meters per second, an accuracy of 0.5 millimeter in length would produce a delay accuracy of 100 nanoseconds.

IRS, FBI EYE INTERNET WITH SUSPICION
The Clinton administration's reluctance to ease up on export controls for
encryption software stems in part from pressure from U.S. law enforcement
agencies, and the owner of a New York-based software company sees heavy
lobbying behind the government's desire to regulate content on the Internet:
"I think the Internal Revenue Service and the FBI are watching this one very
carefully.  They wouldn't mind seeing the government set a precedent for
deciding what can and cannot go on the Internet."  The IRS fears that easy
access to cheap and sophisticated encryption software will make income- and
sales-tax evasion too easy, and the FBI worries about criminal and terrorist
plots hatched in cyberspace, but some observers say government control
tactics are too little, too late.  A Hudson Institute economist says,
"Electronic money gets really interesting when you realize how impossible it
is to put national walls around it, mandate the use of national currencies,
or require that transactions go through banks...  The country will have no
practical choice but to rely more than ever on voluntary tax compliance.
That means tax rates will have to be kept as low as possible on people and
on businesses."  (Investor's Business Daily 9 Jan 96 B1)

you walk across the straits, the system has the time to react and restore
a dynamic equilibrium. If you immediately release a new species with no
natural predators, the system is shattered, and it might not survive. This is not to say that ecosystems and societies are static -- they evolve
constantly, displaying unpredictable punctuated equilibrium (Steven J.
Gould was right, Edmund Burke and Karl Marx were wrong).
     A few things from the biological point of view (and I _will_ try to
bring in a bit of cypherpunks relevance). First, if the ecosystem were as
unstable as the Greens in the 1960's and later kept predicting (Silent Spring
and all that), it would have collapsed already. Look at how many species we've
taken out already. Second, almost all ecosystems that are that vulnerable (to
extinction of a keystone species or to import of something that starts eating)
are small ones that don't really matter in the long run. For one thing, the
more biodiversity _within_ an ecosystem exists, the more likely it is that
something from outside (or something removed from within) will have a control
(or a replacement). In other words, there are fewer and fewer true keystone
species as the internal biodiversity of an ecosystem goes up.
among mainstrean "environmentalists," and the Sierra Club and World
Wildlife Federation calendars raise a lot of money, but it's the plants
and bugs and bacteria that are really important. Elephants and blue whales
look big and important to us, but they're really inconsequential in the
larger scheme of biodiversity. They could go extinct and the planet
doesn't really care. But kill the blue-green algae and the trees, and
we're all dead.      The algae? Sure, they're important... they're also thoroughly likely to
not be affected significantly. One, they've got so many things acting on them
in the first place. Two, there is quite a bit of diversity within the algal
group. What takes out one strain (I have always had my doubts about "species"
with mitotically reproducing organisms) is unlikely to take out the rest... and
they mutate quickly enough to give rise to more strains pretty rapidly when one
"niche" is freed up.
     The trees, on the other hand, are in the classification of "nice to look
at but not really neccessary," like the elephants. They're a great carbon
_sink_, but they don't really do that much CO2 recycling. And even if they
were... we can replant trees very quickly. It's the rain forests and the old
growth forests that are hard to replace as such.
      Cypherpunks relevance? Well, digital cash and encrypted messaging make
it a lot easier to do the type of deals you're talking about... they also make
it harder for people to place irrelevant prerequisites (like "not from rain
forest land") on their purchases. So far, most of the anti-cypherpunks
arguments have come from the conservative side. Be prepared for some from the
liberal environmentalists (as well as the liberal socialists who want to keep
lots of tax dollars flowing).

I suspect that the NSA was thinking in our terms long before many of

their behavior is perfectly rational. Their goals are merely
different. If you are in SIGINT, I believe that the possibility of
totally losing a valued intelligence tool must heavily weigh on your
mind. Of course, they are hardly monolithic, and different groups at
the NSA necessarily have different goals.
Once SIGINT becomes much harder regardless of their previous attempts
to stop it, I suspect that the NSA will become a friend and not an
impediment. By that time, of course, the "we have to protect our

EXODUS FROM COMMERCIAL SERVICES?
Commercial online services are having a difficult time keeping customers and
differentiating themselves, as more savvy computer users switch over to
small Internet access providers.  "Most everything I find on the online
services, I can find using an Internet service provider," says one customer
who's made the switch.  "For me, the need for an online service is
diminishing."  "AOL is like the Internet on training wheels," says another,
who feels he's "graduated."  In tandem with subscriber defection is the
problem of content providers who increasingly are setting up their own shops
on the Web, bypassing the commercial services altogether.  The popularity of
the Web "turns the model of the online services industry upside down," says
Scott Kurnit, the former No. 2 executive at Prodigy, who's now running an
Internet service for MCI and News Corp.  While the number of commercial
service subscribers has grown to about 12.5 million over the past decade
(doubling in the past year), the number of World Wide Web users increased
eight-fold, to eight-million, in just the past year, according to
International Data Corp.  (Wall Street Journal 18 Jan 96 A6)

The number of people subscribing to more than one online service has dropped

Power DirecTV says the explosive growth of satellite TV piracy and the flood
of American direct-to-home dishes into Canada is threatening to wipe out

   _ Friday January 26 2:01 PM EST _
Boston Fed Minehan Warns Of "Virtual" Bank Danger
   NEW YORK - Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Cathy Minehan is
   warning against potential risks of "virtual" banking -- or
   electronic account systems handling electronic money.
   Minehan stressed that the regulatory community has just begun to
   consider these issues and that much work needs to be done before it
   even knows all the questions to ask, let alone what answers to give.
   "Legislation and regulation of new payments system alternatives
   could be unwise right now, but that does not mean that participants in
   such systems should not oversee them or that central banks should not
   be concerned" Minehan said in an address to the Goldman, Sachs
   Conference on Risk Reduction in Payments, Clearance and Settlement
   Systems.
   "'Smart' card technology is now being used to store electronic
   'notes' authorized by the card-holder's bank that can be used to
   transfer value between banks, consumers and merchants," she said.
   "These electronic 'notes' flow over the Internet and give
   authorization for funds to be withdrawn from a bank account and paid
   to another party electronically," Minehan said.
   "This can come close to being a new form of currency in that the
   potential exists for the value on the card to remain in circulation,
   transferring from card to card, and one endpoint to another, without
   necessarily being converted to a more traditional form of money,"
   she said.
   "'In this regard, it is especially intriguing to consider how the
   'virtual' bank might be regulated," said Minehan. "Some
   maintain that virtual banking is just a new form of bank which all the
   usual rules and regulations apply," she said.

that I've had for preventing such problems is to look for addresses from such

access they will hopefully be denied, although an alternate possibility). Then

making sure that the email in question can't be blocked by simple means such

'Primary Colors' Author Steps Forward
   NEW YORK (Reuter) - One of the best kept secrets in political,
   journalistic and publishing circles was revealed Wednesday when
   Newsweek journalist Joe Klein admitted he was ''Anonymous'', the
   mysterious author of a novel based on President Clinton's 1992
   presidential campaign.
   Klein, facing fellow journalists who had been speculating along with
   many politicians and readers about the identity of ''Anonymous'' since
   the book's publication in January, fended off questions about his
   credibility and about how he had lied when asked whether he wrote the
   book.
   ``It wasn't easy, but I felt that there are times when I too can lie
   to protect a source and I put this in that category. Other people may
   see this differently,'' said Klein.
   CBS News later said it was unhappy with Klein, who works for the
   network as a political consultant.
   ``We are obviously disturbed by the fact that Joe Klein was not
   forthcoming with us nor with nearly anyone else of his authorship of
   the novel 'Primary Colors,''' CBS News executive Vice President
   Jonathan Klein (no relation) said in a statement. He said network
   president Andrew Hayward would meet the author next week to discuss
   the matter.
   His announcement followed a report in Wednesday's Washington Post that
   handwritten changes to the manuscript appeared to match Klein's
   handwriting.

   CORVALLIS, Ore. (Mar 8, 1996 11:09 a.m. EST) -- Ingredients for a
   fertilizer bomb like the one that killed 169 people in Oklahoma City
   were found on a farm along with bomb-making instructions, guns and
   drugs, police said.
   Four people were arrested on weapons and drug charges. Charges
   involving illegal explosives were expected to be filed later, police
   Sgt. Dennis Carson said Thursday.
   Officers seized a large quantity of fuel oil and the fertilizer
   ammonium nitrate, two key ingredients in the April 19 Oklahoma City
   bombing.
   "My understanding is it could have made a large bomb and a rather
   large explosion had it been detonated," Carson said. "All they had to
   do was mix the parts. It would take just a few minutes."
   He wouldn't say how much fertilizer was found in the raid Wednesday
   night near this city about 80 miles south of Portland. The fertilizer,
   found in an 8,000-square-foot barn, was removed in a state police
   bomb-squad truck.
   Carson said investigators were trying to determine whether those
   arrested had plans to bomb a building or had ties to any
   anti-government groups.
   The federal Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms is investigating.
   Along with the material for the fertilizer bomb, officers found 29
   guns, including eight assault rifles, and material to make pipe bombs.
   Three ounces of marijuana and some methamphetamine were also found.
   All were charged with drug possession and Luehring and the younger
   Bradley were also charged with being ex-convicts in possession of
   weapons.
   Carson didn't have details on their criminal past.

added the message's steaographic concealment to the end of a "stack", and

Firms to Offer Computer to Telephone System
   NEW YORK (Reuter) - Two New Jersey companies said Friday they have
   developed technology that will allow voice conversations via the
   Internet between users of computers and ordinary telephones.
   The two companies, VocalTec Inc. of Northvale, and Dialogic Corp. of
   Parsippany, said they expect the system to be available in the next
   few months.
   The company said the computer-to-telephone connection, known as the
   Internet Phone Telephony Gateway, will allow computer users to place
   calls to normal local, long-distance or international telephone users.
   Internet-based phone communication presents a low-cost alternative to
   traditional telephone communications handled by local and
   long-distance carriers.
   It enables callers to combine the low cost of Internet connections,
   the convenience of initiating calls from either PCs or telephones, and
   the ability to communicate with anybody with a telephone via the
   public switched telephone network.
   However, the Internet poses technical problems such as variable voice
   quality and momentary speaking delays that preclude, at least for now,
   any widespread replacement of existing phone networks by Internet
   telephone communications.
   VocalTec chairman Elon Ganor said the software provides the
   conversational quality of a good cellular phone connection, but the
   quality may vary depending on the sophistication of the Internet
   access company providing the local connections.
   He said the Internet telephone gateway is expected to be available as
   a complete system in the second quarter of this year.
   The product will be available to third party product developers to
   incorporate into their own products.
   Ganor said the products will be sold through Dialogic and Vocaltec's
   existing networks of resellers, system integrators and direct
   channels.
   VocalTec said the Internet Phone Telephony Gateway will enable new
   applications that use the Internet as a low-cost network for
   computer-to-telephone and phone-to-phone calls.
   Calls to wireline and cellular phones are possible.
   The system is comprised of a PC running Windows 95 and the VocalTec
   gateway software and a Dialogic computer telephone adapter card and
   linked to the telephone network and the Internet through a 28.8
   kilobit or faster modem connection.
   The new software complements the company's existing Internet telephone
   software, which currently can only connect one personal computer user
   to another.
   ``The availability of the Internet as an open, global information
   network has generated considerable interest from our customers,'' said
   Bob Heymann, vice president of business development at Dialogic.
   ``The Internet Telephony Gateway will enable (resellers) and systems
   integrators to offer innovative applications such as international
   'hop off' and Internet-based customer service,'' he said.
   Dialogic is a leading maker of add-on computer hardware circuit boards
   that enable computers to function as telephones.
   VocalTec is headquartered in Herzliya, Israel and has U.S. offices in
   Northvale, N.J. It went public Feb. 7, 1996.

              For Immediate Release, March 4, 1996          Virtual Magistrate Established for the Internet
       Voluntary Dispute Resolution for Network Conflicts
     A newly established Virtual Magistrate Project will assist
in the rapid, initial resolution of computer network disputes. The specialized system of online arbitration and fact-finding was
announced by Timothy C. Leixner, Chairman of the Board of the
National Center for Automated Information Research (NCAIR) which
is funding the pilot project.  The Fellows of the Cyberspace Law
Institute helped in the development of the project.
     "Millions of people around the world communicate and conduct
business on computer networks," said Mr. Leixner in announcing
the project.  "Disputes are inevitable, and existing courts can
be too slow, too cumbersome, and too local to have global effect. We need to explore new forms of dispute resolution, provide
timely relief, and develop appropriate sanctions that are
suitable for worldwide computer networks.  That is the purpose of
the Virtual Magistrate Project."
     A pool of neutral arbitrators with experience in the law and
in the use of computer networks will serve as the Virtual
Magistrates.  The magistrates (who do not have to be lawyers)
will be selected jointly by the American Arbitration Association
and the Cyberspace Law Institute, and will undergo training in
arbitration techniques.       Complaints will be accepted through either through
electronic mail or through a form on the Virtual Magistrate's
World Wide Web site.  Internet users, system operators, and
others affected by network messages, postings, and files may be
the source of complaints.  Initially, the Virtual Magistrate will
decide whether it would be reasonable for a system operator to
delete or otherwise restrict access to a challenged message,
posting, or file.       Objections may be based on copyright or trademark
infringement, misappropriation of trade secrets, defamation,
fraud, deceptive trade practices, inappropriate (obscene, lewd,
or otherwise violative of local system rules) materials, invasion
of privacy, and other wrongful content.  At a later date, the
Virtual Magistrate may accept complaints about other network-
related activities.
     The need for a fast and accessible resolution of disputes is
highlighted by ongoing litigation involving Netcom On-Line
Communications Services and the Church of Scientology.  The
Church alleged that postings made by a Netcom user infringed on
the Church's copyrights.  The case is before federal district
court, and a lengthy proceeding is expected.  Arbitration though
the Virtual Magistrate Project might have been able to offer an
independent assessment of whether there was infringement.  Prompt
identification of reasonable responses for system operators would
clearly be beneficial to all.  Use of the Virtual Magistrate for
immediate resolution of disputes would not preclude traditional
     An impartial magistrate will be assigned to each complaint. Proceedings will normally take place through electronic mail. The goal is to reach a decision within 72 hours (three business
days) whenever possible.  Information on cases decided by the
Virtual Magistrate will be publicly available at a World Wide Web
site maintained by the Villanova Center for Information Law and
Policy at .  Other documentation
for the Project is available at the same Web site.
     David Johnson, Co-Director of the Cyberspace Law Institute
said:  "The Virtual Magistrate Project is not a solution to all
network problems.  Some matters will inevitably end up in
traditional courts.  If the Virtual Magistrate Project can
contribute to the swift, inexpensive, and fair resolution of some

     The Virtual Magistrate Project is a pilot project. Adjustments to the rules and procedures will be made based on
experience.  The Project will be evaluated by the participants at
a conference to be convened by NCAIR and CLI in May 1996, and
decisions will be made about finding a more permanent structure
and funding.  NCAIR has made $75,000 available for the operation
of the pilot.
     NCAIR is a non-profit, educational corporation actively

legal and accounting professions since 1966.       The American Arbitration Association (AAA) is a
public-service, not-for-profit organization offering a broad
range of dispute resolution services to corporations, attorneys,
insurers, individuals, trade associations, unions, consumers, and
all levels of government.  AAA has been an international focal
point for private dispute resolution since arbitration became an
acceptable alternative to courts in the 1920s.
     George Friedman, Senior Vice President of AAA said:  "Given
the increasing inaccessibility of the court system and the
explosive growth of online technology, it is quite appropriate
that an effort would be made to develop a means of resolving
disputes simply and quickly online.  The American Arbitration
Association is delighted to be a founding partner of the Virtual
Magistrate Project, which will undoubtedly pave new ground in
advancing alternative dispute resolution."
     The Villanova Center for Information Law and Policy will
maintain a public online repository of Virtual Magistrate
complaints, decisions, and documents.  The Villanova Center will
also maintain electronic discussion groups for magistrates,
participants, and other interested parties, and it will work
jointly with AAA to prepare training materials.  The Villanova

      *******************************************************
It appears that our recent FREE WORLD DIALUP press release was the straw
that broke the camel's back.
The FCC was petitioned yesterday by ACTA "TO STOP MISUSE OF THE INTERNET".
The sale and use of Voice-On-the-Net (VON) software is being challenged by
130 of the USA's largest long distance telephone carriers.  Among them, MCI,
SPRINT, and LDDS.
According to the ACTA press release:
"A growing number of companies are selling software programs with ancillary
hardware options that enable a computer to transmit voice conversations.
This, in fact, creates the ability to "by-pass" local, long distance and
international carriers and allows for calls to be made for virtually 'no cost.'"
And also, "...the misuse of the Internet as a way to "by-pass" the
traditional means of obtaining long distance service could result in a
significant reduction of the Internet's ability to transport its ever
enlarging amount of data traffic."
'VON' COALITION BEING FORMED
A VON Coalition is currently being formed and members will testify at the
spring meeting of the FCC when they discus telephony issues.
If you don't want to loose your right to VON technology, NOW is the time to

Putting together a web spider that would search for such could be a profitable
undertaking. I did some checking on AltaVista and found one service by the
name of "Naughty Lynx" which automatically checks all of its links every hour
or so - one problem with "adult-oriented" sites is that they disappear a lot.
Some such feature would probably be necessary. Seems to be a good potential
use of the DigiCash system, since one doesn't need merchant anonymnity that

prior restraint, as in restraining something from being published at all, was
considered unconstitutional by all but the nut-case authoritarians. But I had
thought that the question of rating was still up in the air - the TV industry
seems to have decided not to fight the V-chip in court, for instance. Since
the government seems to have decided that it can remove "indecent" material,
as judged by them, from the purview of minors, it could argue that a mandated
rating system is the "least restrictive" way to do so - ignoring that others
can use it for further restrictions.

of allowing anyone who wishes to create a rating system, just as I am in favor

Revisionism. But I wish to discourage people from doing either (or at least in
the first case from creating systems that can be misused in such an obvious
theft. It gets the attention. I am angered by modern trends in favor of
_either_ parental (parents deciding their kids shouldn't learn about evolution,
or about sex) or societal (curfews et al). I am also angered by cases like the
Joey Buttafuocco (sp?) one, in which he was convicted for having sex with a
(definitely willing) minor who was decided to be sufficiently competent to
be tried as an adult for committing murder. I had a set of decidedly
overprotective parents myself, and I can trace lots of psychological damage
from that. They did it out of love, but sometimes that just doesn't work.
more reign over their children than absolutely necessary. Parents have certain
rights over their children which derive from their responsibilities over those
children - i.e., to keep those children safe, get them educated so they can
have freedoms like speech and press, et al. If the parent can't clearly show
that the intervention into the child's life isn't necessary for that
responsibility to be fulfilled, then the parent shouldn't be able to do that
intervention any more than I should be able to claim that the CO2 being put

evidence otherwise.

Topics to be explored in the workshop and resulting publication include:       - policy and management issues concerning:          network addresses          domain names          routing policy          settlements          interconnect points          intercontinental connectivity          quality of service standards       - legal and institutional structures for supporting core        Internet functions;       - institutions and policies needed to ensure the future        scalability and extensibility of the Internet;       - technical and implementation issues presented by        heterogeneous national information policies;       - the need for data in support of Internet planning,        including issues of how data should be collected and        maintained;       - coordination needed for the deployment of new        technology;       - international crisis management for the Internet. Although the Internet is already substantially privatized, certain essential functions -- notably the domain name registry, network number assignment, and the routing arbiter -- are still funded by the U.S. Government.  Unlike the local telephone exchange, these integrative services are managed by third parties, contributing to an open competitive environment which has helped enable rapid growth of the Internet.  Rapid growth, commercialization, and internationalization are putting stress on current institutions and procedures -- which are neither self-sustaining nor officially recognized at the international level.  The National Science Foundation plans to phase out support for core administrative services and for international connections, just as it has withdrawn support for production-level backbone services.  Conflicts over tradenames and number assignments suggest that international legitimacy is needed for domain name and network number management. Beyond support for essential functions, there are many practical and policy issues where some greater degree of coordination or institutional leadership may be desirable.  For example, how can the implementation of new technology and protocols be expedited? What common definitions and guidelines should exist to describe network performance?  Should the functions performed by current Internet institutions (such as the Internic, RIPE, APNIC, and the IANA) be brought into a more robust international infrastructure, and if so, how?  To what extent are multilateral peering arrangements and settlements needed to encourage continued growth and competition in the Internet access industry? The conference will engage scholars, practitioners and policy makers in examining and discussing these issue.  It will bring together stake-holders, academics and individual leaders within and beyond the Internet community to help define the future institutional infrastructure of the Internet. Workshop papers will be revised and edited following the workshop for publication by MIT Press as part of the Harvard Information Infrastructure Project series.  Potential participants are encouraged to submit papers that can be developed and revised for publication (copyright assignment is not required).

That would also cure having to have Netscape and other high-network-access

for CyberAngel activities. I had sent him several examples of spams, to which
he replied with messages showing a distinct lack of knowledge (thinking I could
filter out messages from the address - which was a mailing list to which I
wish to subscribe, for instance). He then noticed my piece in CuDigest
suggesting that spams and other Internet abuse would be something proper for
the CyberAngels to be involved with - instead of the censorship they advocate.
After noticing this, he wrote me back, told me that spams were not something
that they were concerned with - they weren't a _real_ problem like pornography
- and legally enjoined me not to send mail to the CyberAngels. (I would thus
appreciate someone forwarding this mail to Mr. Hatcher; he is not visibly on

and freedom of press - over the internet. There are four points that may be
made regarding child pornography:
As an example, I believe the pornographic videos involving Traci Lords (who was
below the age of 18 when they were made) are legal to posess in most of Europe.
This difference is similar to that in ages for statutory rape; Mississipi, for
instance has one of 12. (I view this as too low, in case anyone is wondering.)

digital editing are all involved in the creation of such faked child

getting someone prosecuted for it.
is on the Net, it is not in and of itself doing any harm to children. It is
the production of actual child pornography that does so. While it may be argued
that giving child pornography a market value will encourage its production, two
counterarguments may be made to this point. First, much of the sexually
explicit images on the net are in violation of copyright; I do not believe that
the CyberAngels are trying to get people prosecuted for this. Second, driving
a market underground tends to raise prices - look at the Drug War; thus, any
reduction in supply due to illegality of the market will simply compensate the
producers more.

alleged harrasment with such mechanisms as kill files; I have some doubt as
to their technical ability in this area. I object, however, to their more
proactive activities, such as "patrolling" and soliciting people to make
complaints about usages of free speech ("harrassment"). These involve either
attempts to cut off someone's Internet access at the ISP's level or, worse,
attempts to attract governmental attention. The first may be the right of the
ISP, unless it is governmental or has a previous contract agreement stating
otherwise; it would still be preferable if others such as the CyberAngels were
to learn the basic lesson of "mind your own business." Bringing goverment into
the matter may both result in a violation of individual civil liberties and
may result in increased governmental control over the Internet.

and mail-bombing. (A properly run anonymous remailer will not forward a mail
bomb any more than a properly run post office will.) I sincerely doubt whether
the CyberAngels are actually doing anything about these problems as opposed to
their fetish of pornography.
Some implementations of such activities - such as the CyberAngels and their
current and proposed activities - are such. Freedom is the right to do what
will not trespass on another's freedom; I defy you to show how having
pornography available, including "obscene" material, trespasses on the freedoms

You have gotta be kidding me, but let's start by differentiating
among laws. I'm a crypto-minarchist, not a crypto-anarchist, so
I still have hope for some (MUCH less) government. I think laws
against murder are good, and lead to more safety for those not in
jail. I think laws against "consensual crimes" are bad, and lead
to government/police corruption extending all the way to the top
[see sigfile]. When I have to say, "where's the victim?" it's a
shitty law. Many laws fail my test.
This is what I called flowery rhetoric in the last post.
This is what astounds me, the advocates of more government always
focus on crimes WITH obvious victims during debates. Once power
is achieved, the victimless crime laws get written. I have said
I do want murderers, and even some (not all) pedophiles, in jail.
If a child pornographer chooses to visit my page and commits a
thoughtcrime involving my babypictures, I say leave him alone. If
he commits a real crime with an unwilling victim I say punish him
even more than the present government punishes him. Libertarians,
when we achieve political power, will find ourselves with abundent
jail cells left over from the tax-and-spend drugwar to put real
criminals (the ones who have an individual victim) in.
There are certainly enough statists who feel a need to increase it.
I am heartened by your opposition to the CDA (though I did not
notice a Cyberangels voice in the debate/protest leading up to
this abominable law...) but I must point out that you offer no
good test, like my "where's the victim?" test, to differentiate
good laws from bad ones. As to more laws leading to less freedom
I stand by my words. Go down to any law library and have a look
at the Code of Federal Regulations. As wordy, poorly-written laws
proliferate, we all become "criminals," subject to the arbitrary
power of the state's prosectors. When the state prosecutors are
a partisan Democrat followed by a partisan Republican, and the
"criminals" are high-ranking Democrats and Republicans, you end
up with a lesser respect for all laws, even the good ones. Again,
see my sigfile. Now imagine the Libertarian party was doing the
same drug-smuggling...Would the feds [let alone the media] be
so silent? I doubt it.
I find it worrisome that you capitalize the word, despite my rant
involving Director Freeh. I repeat: The community is made up of
Therefore, I guess, the "Community" must forcibly take my key
to make sure that last PGPmessage wasn't child porn, right?
It is important to make sure I don't commit thoughtcrime.
Look. I don't care if some old man beats off to the tune of baby
pictures. There is no victim. If he finds a victim, toss him in
the slammer, or kill him. Right now, the tax-and-spend drugwar is
creating a revolving-door justice system when it comes to victim
crimes, and the people (naturally) disrespect the law. Respect
for ALL law, good and bad, is poisoned by this foolishness and
when combined with a disrespect for the historical power of
juries to nullify shitty laws, and ignorance of history.
Oh, why bother with this self-help, vigilante solution to the
need for authentication. Why not just pass another law? PGP is
a pain-in-the-ass to install and learn. I'm sure the Congress
and President Clinton (who has also experienced e-mail forgery)
would support it, and then you won't have to bother learning
PGP or reading that awful PGPdoc1 & PGPdoc2.
the Guardian Angels are very definitely pro-drug-war. This is informative about
the CyberAngels, especially considering their association with SafeSurf. Their
parental-censorship system includes the ability to filter out many articles
disagreeing with their position on the Drug War - namely those citing that
certain presently illegal substances (e.g., marijuana) are much less dangerous
than the government wishes people to believe. While I do not approve of minors
using addictive drugs (including nicotine), enabling their parents to cut off
political speech of which the parent and the CyberAngels disapprove is hardly
an increase in the real freedom of anyone.

would be no need for a Bill of Rights. Protected freedoms are there because
even a democratically elected government - the closest thing to a determiner
of the "social contract" in the real world - cannot be trusted. For instance,
the current social contract in Germany would apper to say that some political
speech - that of neo-Nazis - is not permitted, and that this is not a violation
of freedoms. It is reasonably evident that this is not the case by any
true definition of freedom.

which the Guardian Angels' politics are coming through. They may claim to be
anti-CDA, but given their harrassment of various sexually-oriented businesses
("cleaning up Times Square" et al) their real opinions seem to be showing
through. They'd make themselves even more unpopular if they were honest about
it, of course. I have no doubt that, if the CDA is upheld (God forbid), they'll
be secretly reporting violations to the DOJ. They already appear to have a

Tracking Internet Infrastructure:
A Handbook on Business, Technology & Structural Issues Reshaping the Landscape of the Commercial Internet An Anthology of Recent Articles  from The COOK Report
The Internet has undergone huge changes in the year since the NSFnet backbone service was turned off.  It has become a much larger, more stratified, and more expensive entity within which to operate.  Since last September we have published a series of articles examining these changes in depth.  We have concluded that it might be useful to gather them together into a single volume which is titled Tracking Internet Infrastructure: an organized, indexed Handbook on Internet Infrastructure This Handbook covers the following critical range of issues:
* interviews with key industry players about viable Internet business models, * the hierarchical organization of ISPs through CIDR and routing pressures, * to the viability of the NAPS; * to renumbering and ownership of IP addresses; * to strains on backbone routers and backbone network redesign with switched cores; * to industry views on quality of service issues; to issues of settlements and route charging; * to issues of bandwidth availability in network design; and to ATM as technology savior or dinosaur.  The rest of this message contains:  (1) Our introduction to the Handbook
1.  Introduction
A Summary of the Operational Environment Power Consolidates at the Top of a Hierarchical Internet
Less than three years ago, at about one twentieth its current size, the topology of the Internet was relatively flat.  Service providers could attach to each other via the NSFnet backbone or CIX router and, for the most part, they could consider themselves plugged directly into the Internet with no one up stream of them.  This meant that no one was in a position to dictate to them a multiplicity of rules, regulations and costs as part of providing Internet service.
One paid the leased line costs for one's own backbone and, in the case of research and education, was connected to the NSFnet backbone for free.  The R&E networks paid ANS a transit fee for their commercial customers.  If the service provider were commercial, it joined the Commercial Internet Exchange and interconnected at the CIX router for the princely sum of $45,000 a year ($10,000 membership fee, $5,000 port fee and about $20,000 for T-1 line to the CIX.  Or one was a downstream customer of Sprint and relied on Sprint to deliver one's packets to the CIX router without having to pay the CIX membership fee.  Over the period of about a year Sprint, by allowing ISPs to resell connectivity, and by giving all ISPs downstream of it connectivity to the rest of the Internet Universe, created a situation where customers of Sprint received most of the benefits given those ISPs that connected directly to the CIX router.  Some ISPs were shocked in mid summer of 1994 when the CIX proposed that those packets of SprintUs resellers who didn't pay the CIX fee would be blocked.
Since then, as the Internet has grown by more than an order of magnitude in size, the importance of the NSFnet and CIX interconnects has either disappeared or faded.  A very hierarchical Internet has emerged.  One can have several levels of upstream service providers.  Such service provision ends at a traffic exchange point known either as a NAP or a MAE.  Address space in the form of IP numbers is no longer handed out the interNIC to all ISPs.  To get address space direct from the interNIC, you have to do one of two things: (1) show that you have no one up stream.  The only way to do that is to directly connect to a NAP or MAE and preferably to more than one.  This level of the hierarchy is reached by perhaps 40 of about 2,400 ISPs nation wide.  Or (2) an ISP can multi-home (take a connection from two different backbone providers).  Perhaps four to five hundred ISPs are multi-homed.  But even a multi-homed ISP is unlikely to get interNIC address space, unless it can demonstrate a rapid rate of growth.
Connecting at a NAP or MAE, in an effort to put one's own operating environment under one's direct control, is very expensive.  Unlike the $45,000 CIX fee the minimum annual cost is $100,000 and up.  Once there, providers have to pay additional sums of money to those still higher in the hierarchy to see that their packets are delivered.  These sums of money are known as transit fees.  Multi-homing is obviously much less But even at traffic exchange points (NAPs or MAEs) there are additional hierarchies.  Some find others who will peer with them.  That is to say, they will engage in cost-free transit for a certain percentage of those attached.  Those at the peak of the hierarchy are the six service providers who are believed to engage in cost free peering and transit with each other - MCI, SPRINT, UUNET, ANS, PSI and AGIS.  These six operate the default free core of the American Internet.  Exchange of routing information among them is supposed to be complete, so that none need say: if your routers don't have address XYZ, send packets by default to the next large central player, in the hope that his routers will know.  Virtually everyone else is, in one sense or another, a customer of these top six.  BBN is a special case.  MCI carries all of BBN's routes.  Consequently in this sense  BBN which is as large as UUNET and certainly much larger than AGIS, is a customer of MCI.  We expect this to change by year's end when AT&T fully deploys the network for its partnership with BBN.  [Editor's Note:  when we fact checked this assertion with sources at BBN we were told that BBN is putting its own national T-3 backbone in place, that significant parts are now operational, that it is at MAE East, MAE West and the Sprint NAP, that it peers with PSI, UUNET, ANS and others, and that its transit relationship with MCI is to reach MCI customers and any Internet sites not directly reachable via its peers.]
Those who are able to buy transit at a NAP gain by this action gain  the ability to ensure it to their downstream (ISP) customers.  In other words transit rights are generally resellable.  In this sense, those who purchase transit at the NAPs or MAEs are as fully connected to the core Internet as the big six - with one critical exception.  They are renting their core connectivity for a hefty monthly price and without the protection of a long term lease.  Readers however should avoid generalizations.  Transit agreements are very private, never talked about openly and vary widely on a case-by-case basis.
IP Numbers and Other Indicators of Hierarchy
Another way of describing the top of the hierarchy is to point out that all six get their IP numbers directly from the interNIC and hand out numbers lower on down in the IP hierarchy to those connected to them.  But this hierarchy is not uniformly rigid.  The rule of thumb of your upstream provider as a source of IP numbers has some notable exceptions.  For example: of the remaining approximately 35 providers which are directly connected to one or more of the major NAPs or MAEs, most get some of their IP numbers direct from the interNIC while others are derived from being attached at some point or in some way to one or more of the central seven.  Finally, as we indicated above, the several hundred ISPs who are multi-homed also get their numbers from the interNIC, as may ISPs who can demonstrate extremely rapid downstream growth.
An ISP without IP addresses is worthless, since the only thing making it possible to connect an individual to the Internet is the IP number that tells others how to find him.  The hierarchy of the Internet is now such that about 80% of service providers must get their addresses directly from their backbone vendors who are often also their competitors.  These address blocks are referred to as CIDR blocks.  We have recently written extensively about them. Until the fall of 1995 large ISPs were able to connect to one or two NAPs and sometimes negotiate cost free peering.  As an option they could then buy transit to the other five from one of the big six.  During the past 90 days this has changed.  Reports reaching us indicate that cost free peering is available only to those connecting at T-3 speed to three or more NAPS a task that will cost an ISP well over $300,000 a year.  But even those who do this will find that there is nothing that will force everyone at each NAP to which they connect to peer with them.  If one or more of the majors refuses to peer with a newcomer, that newcomer will have to buy transit to that major from one of those with which it peers or be in the awkward position of being unable to reach a significant part of the Internet.
For most of 1995 an ISP connecting to a NAP could by transit for $5 to 15 thousand dollars a month from one of the seven.  But reports reaching us now indicate that the six have effectively eliminated the purchase of transit from them as an option for domestic ISPs.  These developments effectively shut off connection to a major NAP as a means for an ISP to operate from the top of the Internet hierarchy.  The only ISPs that may even attempt to do so now are those with upwards of $500,000 a year to spend on the adventure.  In the meantime the NAPs themselves are developing a hierarchy.  MAEs either are opening or have opened in Los Angeles, Texas, Chicago and New York.  Without the presence of at least the big six at these NAPs, all they are good for is exchanging local traffic among local ISPs and keeping loads on long haul backbones down.
The Issue of IP When a customer changes phone service from AT&T to MCI, or visa versa, that customer does not have to change phone numbers.  Although the portability of  IP address assignments from CIDR blocks has been discouraged it has never been prohibited.  But last month a new internet draft (draft-ietf-cidrd-addr-ownership-07.txt) by Yakov Rekhter and Tony Li of Cisco was published.  This draft created much debate in mid February when it was put forth by the CIDRD Working Group for elevation to best current practice.  Such elevation would put IETF approval behind the practice of a service provider insisting on the return of address space when a customer left.  If such a customer were to go to a different service provider for a new connection, every one attached to that customer's network would be forced to renumber their own networks.  For a network of any size renumbering would be expensive and, if that network were involved in anything approaching a mission critical application, would become unthinkable.
This would very likely mean that any customers buying leased lines to connect a network larger than a few dozen hosts in size will find themselves well-advised to purchase only from an ISP directly attached to one or more of the MAEs/NAPs -- and, therefore, in direct control of its address space.  Furthermore, the safest and most conservative action with be to connect to the six providers who are part of the default free backbone.  Certainly we suspect that the auto industry would tell its suppliers not to connect outside the direct NAP connected top tier.
While there are technical reasons for this policy (fear of the collapse of internet routing if it is not carried out), it is ironic that such policy would greatly accelerate the Internet's stratification into a business service and a consumer service, for those who are there to explore, just for the fun of it.  There is also an anti-competitive aspect to implementing such policy, in that large organization customers, which embed non-transferable IP addresses into their network hosts are really locking themselves to a single provider.  Should a provider's service becomes "less than optimal," we are sure that providers are aware that the cost associated with renumbering in order to change vendors, limits their customer's options.  While network address translation devices (NATs) do exist and will give some customers an alternative, they are by no means regarded as a perfect answer to these difficult problems. It is beginning to appear that, the more the Internet increases in size, the faster that power flows upwards into the hands of a few who, since they are both operators and rule makers for the commercial Internet, would find themselves singled out for accusations of blatant conflict of interest in most other situations.  Under these conditions where the fox is essentially in charge of the hen house.  Given the nature of a large portion of the customer base (ie large industry and educational networks), we wonder how long customers will suffer these burdens without demanding regulatory relief.

3.  The Audience for the Handbook
Within the national Internet service provider community, Tracking Internet Infrastructure is intended to educate strategists with the complexities facing their engineering and operations staff.  Among smaller ISPs it should serve as a tool to bring owner-operators, who are busy 18 hours a day ordering lines, installing them and servicing their customers, up to speed on the changes going on in the environment in which they must operate.  LECs and other phone companies will find it useful.  Finally familiarity with the issues discussed within the Handbook will provide corporate MIS people with a valuable knowledge base from which to negotiate with their present or future internet service However, since these infrastructure issues are also critical to the continued growth and success of the industry, this Handbook is expected to be a tool for use by those in the banking and investment community.  If those in the financial community understand the changing technical and power relationships in the industry, they will be able to improve the quality of their investment decision making.  It should also be useful to corporate strategic planners who will be advising their companies' decision making in vertical industry applications.

main one.
consider income taxes to be enough of the story to go by them alone. Federal
level, yes; state & local, probably not. I am willing to bet that property
taxes are mainly paid by the relatively wealthy, given how much of personal
capital tends to get tied up in a home. Sales taxes are more evenly
true, even if it might not be completely true currently.

being on more of a cash-based economy. But the largest reason is probably
that the IRS doesn't care nearly as much about each individual at the low

Now, the low end tax evasion probably costs the government a lot more than
the rich does... but it's also a lot harder to pursue.

ANALYSIS:  FREE NET TELEPHONY
by Craig A. Johnson
American Reporter Correspondent
                    THE REGULATORS MEET THE INTERNET
                           by Craig A. Johnson
                     American Reporter Correspondent
        WASHINGTON -- Fears of Rambo-like regulation have spawned a sort
of spring fever in the online world, with presumptive alarms and bulletins
ricocheting all over the Net.
        Will the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) choke the
Internet's wide-open pathways with regulatory underbrush?  Will the
petition filed by the Americas' Carriers Telecommunications Association
(ACTA) on March 4 be granted, stopping Internet telephony or mandating
access charges? (AR, No. 245 ) Or, even more catastrophically, will the
Net somehow be swept under the FCC regime for telecommunications carriers?
        The answers, according to sources both inside and outside of the
FCC, for the time being, are a qualified no.  On April 19, the FCC gave
its tentative response on the Net telephony problem, partially assuaging
worries that new regulations will require access charges and tariffing for
long distance voice over the Internet.  Although the soft no from the FCC
was reassuring, the wall protecting Internet voice as an "information
service" has scores of cracks and may still crumble under the blows of a
regulatory hammer.
        The issue was addressed in the FCC's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
(NPRM) on "interconnection," or more formally, "implementation of
the local competition provisions in the Telecommunications Act of
1996."  The NPRM is as interesting for what it does not say as for
what it does.
        Generally, it poses a lot of questions, on which parties will file
comments, and on the basis of which the FCC will finalize rules in August.
The agency sees the proceeding and the consequent rules as establishing
"the 'new regulatory paradigm' that is essential to achieving Congress'
policy goals."
        The visible fractures in the old regulatory regime stood out
prominently in the interconnection notice.  Two aspects of the proceeding,
in particular, directly relate to Internet access and pricing regimes.
        First, the FCC made it clear that current access charges and
interconnection regulations are "enforceable until they are superseded."
The FCC said, in regulatory-ese, that it wanted comments on "any aspect of
this Notice that may affect existing 'equal access and nondiscriminatory
interconnection restrictions and obligations (including receipt of
        Translated, this means that Net telephone providers and users can
breathe a little more easily for the time being.  But, the call for
comments on the existing "restrictions and guidelines" should not be taken
for granted.  It is precisely these regulations -- which exempt "enhanced
service" providers, like Internet and online service providers from paying
access charges for their usage of the facilities and network components of
local exchange carriers (LECs) -- which are on the table in this
proceeding and related ones.
        A second aspect of the interconnection proceeding relates directly
to definitions.  The Commission asks for comment "on which carriers are
included under" the definition of "telecommunications carriers" offered in
the Telecommunications Act of 1996.
        Critically, the agency asks:  "How does the provision of an
information service [as conventionally defined in the law and prior
regulations], in addition to an unrelated telecommunications service,
affect the status of a carrier as a 'telecommunications carrier?'"
        This is a call for commenters to address the issue of whether
"information service providers," such as ISPs, who also provide
"telecommunications services," should be treated as "telecommunications
carriers" and therefore be subject to all, some, or none of the
requirements of common carriers, including the payment of access charges
and the filing of tariffs.
        In practical terms the FCC is asking the online community to
persuade them that ISPs who permit Internet audio streaming applications,
such as long distance voice, should not be considered under the same rules
applying to "telecommunications providers."
        The FCC emphasizes that the interconnection rulemaking "is one of
a number of interrelated proceedings," and explains that the answer to
how, in which ways, and to what extent the Internet will be regulated will
be a product of "the interrelationship between this proceeding, our
recently initiated proceeding to implement the comprehensive universal
service provisions of the 1996 Act and our upcoming proceeding to reform
our Part 69 access charge rules."
        This should be seen as a warning flag that issues concerning
access charges for the Internet have yet to be even taken up by the
Commission, and will be one of the outcomes of several complex
proceedings, with public comments invited from all consumer and business
        The FCC NPRM and order establishing the joint federal-state
universal service board, issued on March 8, for example, emphasizes the
provision in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 which stipulates that
"[a]ccess to advanced telecommunications and information services should
be provided in all regions of the country."  The FCC says that "commenters
may wish to discuss Internet access availability, data transmission
capability, ... enhanced services, and broadband services."
        In both this and the interconnection notices, the agency
emphasizes its statutory authority to regulate the Internet.  The news so
far is relatively positive.  The FCC claims it doesn't want to prematurely
slap regulations on the Net which may stunt its remarkable growth and
        But the handwriting is on the wall -- in several different hands
and scrawled over cracks.  Arguments for Internet volume-based or
per-packet pricing will be surely surface in comments in the FCC
proceedings.  The old argument for the "modem tax," which says that data
bits should be priced differently than voice bits, will likely rear its
scarred head.
        Internet access is on the charts and in the dockets at the
Commission.  It should have the same pride of place for all Internet
activists and user group communities.  The FCC is asking the Internet and
computer user and business communities to wake up to an emergent
regulatory regime in which the old comfortable dualities such as
"information services" and "telecommunications services" -- which in the
past have insulated the Internet from regulation -- may not be easily
parsed.  In short, the agency is begging for help in drafting the
cyber-roadmaps for the future.

interconnection NPRM can be accessed via the FCC's Web page --

proceedings are also now available at the site.)

FARNET's Washington Update --- April 26, 1996
IN THIS ISSUE:
o  1996 Appropriations stalemate finally ends while FY97 appropriations
round heats up
o  FCC proposes free spectrum for community networking
1996 APPROPRIATIONS STALEMATE FINALLY ENDS WHILE FY97 APPROPRIATIONS ROUND
HEATS UP
After months of negotiations and two partial government shutdowns, the
President and the Republican Congress finally came to agreement this week
on an omnibus spending bill for the remaining five months of FY96.  The
bill includes appropriations for the NSF and Commerce among several other
agencies.  At the same time, authorization and appropriations bills are
being worked through committees in the House for FY97 which begins on Oct.
The final FY96 budget for NSF came to $3.22B --- $40M above what the House
and Senate had previously agreed upon this year.   However, this week also
saw the House Science Committee authorize NSF spending for FY97 at only
$3.25B, a $75M cut from NSF's $3.325 request, which would give NSF less
than a 1% raise over FY96.
NSF has generally faired well amidst Republican (specifically House Science
Committee Chair Robert Walker (PA)) efforts to cut science spending for all
but what they define as "basic science."  Democrats protested that the
omnibus science authorization bill passed out of the committee this week
was done too hastily, bypassing subcommittees for a one-day full committee
session.  Ranking Science Committee member George Brown (D-CA) complained
that, among other things, "The Republican bill would eliminate the Social
Science directorate....[and make] arbitrary personnel cuts at the National
Science Foundation."
The Commerce Department's TIIAP (Information Infrastructure Grants) program
scraped by with an (anticipated) $21.5M for FY96.
FCC PROPOSES FREE SPECTRUM FOR COMMUNITY NETWORKING
Apple's NII Band petition which was filed almost a year ago at the FCC will
finally see some action there.  The FCC today released a Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking that proposes to make 350 megahertz of spectrum available for
use by unlicensed equipment termed "NII/SUPERNet" devices.  The Commission
voted 4-0 to release the proposal.  The proposal comes after Apple Computer
petitioned the FCC last year to create a "NII Band" that would permit
high-speed data communications available to anyone without licensing or
air-time charges.
The FCC's NPRM would make spectrum from 5.25-5.35 GHz and 5.725-5.875 GHz
available to devices that would fall under Part 15 of FCC rules, mandating
only minimum technical standards and a basic "listen-before-talk" protocol
standard.  The FCC would also place power and out-of-band emissions limits
on the devices, thus allowing only short-range (probably indoor or within
campus) networking.
The Apple petition last year advocated allowing users to use the devices
for long-range (community-based with particularly emphasis on rural areas)
communications.  A rival group called the WINForum (made up of a number of
telecommunications companies) balked at the idea of long-range use of the
spectrum (which might cut into their businesses).  Apple's long-range
proposal may not be dead yet though.  Commissioner Ness, in a separate
statement on the NPRM, said she was "intrigued by the Apple long-haul
proposal, which contemplates low-cost broadband links from homes to schools
and libraries," but pointed to a number of questions that would need to be
resolved before the Commission could proceed with such a proposal.
The FCC clearly sees this proposal as an effort to help fulfill the
President's promise to connect every school in the country to the
"information superhighway."  The NII/SUPERNet proposal is aimed at helping
schools and other institutions do that without having to go to the expense
of wiring entire buildings.  Furthermore, the proposal may help take the
wind out of the sails of those who have recently been pressuring the FCC to
include inside wiring of schools in the universal service mechanism for
schools and libraries - the Snowe-Rockefeller-Kerry provisions from the new
telecom law.

            OPTIONS FOR INTERNET AND BROADBAND ACCESS

             Announcement and Call for Participation
     This conference looks at options for Internet and broadband
access from the perspective of home owners, apartment complexes,
and small businesses.  It will evaluate opportunities and
obstacles for "bottom-up" infrastructure development and the
implications for traditional and alternative providers at the
neighborhood, regional, and national levels.  We are seeking
original analysis, position papers, and background material for
use in the conference program, on the project website, and in a
book to be published in early 1997.
     The conference challenges business and policymakers to
rethink fundamental issues in telecommunications policy by
recasting the "problem of the last 100 feet" as "opportunities
for the first 100 feet."  This paradigm shift suggests
consumer/property owner investment as an answer to the dilemma of
whether there should be one or two wires into the home.  The
conference will survey alternative options for local connection
to the Internet from the perspective of homeowners with high-end
needs for data communications, apartment owners, small
businesses, and others with an interest in investing in end-user
equipment and real estate.  It will consider prospects for
broadly distributed infrastructure investment and potential roles for
utility companies, special assessment districts, municipalities,
PCS providers, CAPs, IXCs, LMDS operators, and Internet access
providers, as well as telcos and cable companies.  It will consider strategies and policies for local interconnection and
interoperability among Internet access providers.
     The conference will investigate constraints on and
incentives for user infrastructure investment at federal, state,
and local levels; whether and how trenching, conduit, and right-
of-ways should be unbundled to promote consumer/property owner
investment and competition among heterogeneous providers; and
the need for and feasibility of interconnection at third-party or
publicly maintained neighborhood access points.  It will look at
synergy with other policy goals and economic interests, such as
intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and energy demand
management.  Finally, in assessing user investment as a driver
for two-way broadband, it asks how scenarios for Internet access
will affect broadband scenarios by stimulating demand for
high-bandwidth connectivity.
     The growth of the Internet has been propelled in significant
part by user investments in infrastructure: computers, internal
wiring, and the connection (dial-up line, leased line, microwave
link) to the Internet service provider.  This "bottom-up"
investment minimizes the investment burden facing service
providers, since customers share the cost of the infrastructure
and providers have no obligation to develop the infrastructure
out to all potential users.  Barriers to entry for service
providers are low, and users retain flexibility in choosing among
     The rapidly growing mass of Internet users, applications,
and resources is now shaping demand for underlying
infrastructure, so that plans for new infrastructure are driven
increasingly by data rather than voice and video.  There are
opportunities to attract new customers instead of competing head-
on for old ones.  Unlike voice and video, there are incremental
upgrade paths for data users and demand for upgraded access is
readily stimulated by experience.  Higher bandwidth connections
are desired by a wide spectrum of users, from those who work at
home to recreational users of the World Wide Web.
     The value of continuous, rather than dial-up connection to
the Internet, is less widely appreciated because it is a
qualitative improvement. Continuous connectivity (which can be
provided by unswitched technologies) obviates tying up a
telephone line, enables instant delivery of email and other
time-sensitive information, and allows small businesses to
advertise and publish directly to the net. Most importantly, it
can enable real-time energy management with attendant cost
savings that can support major infrastructure investment, which
the advent of residential "wheeling" may induce consumers to make
on their own.  A personal computer or an inexpensive router could
serve as a gateway extending Internet functions to other
computers in the home, manage utility demand, operate security
systems, and control any lights, sound equipment, and other
household appliances.
     As telecommunications and electric utilities are
deregulated, investment decisions will devolve into the hands of
consumers, where they can be made with greater knowledge of
particular benefits and tradeoffs.  At the same time, new
technologies, such as wireless and data transmission over power
lines, will increase consumer options. There may be a variety of
options for configuring "the last mile," with different balances
between user-provided and centrally provided facilities.
Homeowners and small businesses may have opportunities to connect
to different suppliers at the curb, on the roof, on the side of
the house, or somewhere in between.
     The early government role and subsequent commercial
practices have facilitated interconnection of Internet service
providers, but the limited choices at the local level -- the
"last mile" as well as the "last 100 feet" -- may make
interconnection an issue.  At present, many local Internet access
providers do not interconnect directly and traffic is sometimes
routed to one of  the few national exchange points hundreds of
miles away.  Opportunities for interconnection, along with
policies on access, may determine whether intermediary transport
providers, such as utility companies, emerge to link homeowner
facilities at the curb with high-bandwidth Internet service
     This analysis of "the first hundred feet" recognizes that
need and demand will naturally vary greatly from  home to home
and from neighborhood to neighborhood.  Much depends on whether
there are business or telecommuting needs that can be met by
individual investments in upgraded access.  While this analysis
looks to the Internet, it raises the issue of how the bottom-up
model will affect the traditional model of a centrally provided
universal service.  Given basic technology that is non-
proprietary and virtually commoditized, some argue that Internet
service is becoming the common denominator platform on which all
other services can be carried.  The absence of service
class priority has hampered use of real-time voice and video on
the Internet, but this will soon change with the implementation
of protocols that allow bandwidth reservation and packet-level
service priority (RSVP and IPv6).

other reasons to revoke a key - on the one hand, someone who frequently revokes

On the other hand, it may be someone who changes them on a regular basis for

Federal Communication Commission
Room 814
1919 M Street, N.W.
Washington D.C. 20554
                                   Re: RM 8775
Dear Chairman Hundt:
     This letter addresses the petition for rulemaking filed before the
Commission by America's Carriers Telecommunication Association (ACTA) in
March 1996.  ACTA asks the Commission to:  (1) order Internet software
providers to "immediately stop their unauthorized provisioning of
telecommunications software"; 2)  confirm the Commission's authority over
interstate and international telecommunications services offered over the
Internet; and 3) institute rules to govern the use of the Internet for
providing telecommunications services.
     On behalf of the Administration, NTIA strongly urges the Commission
to deny the ACTA Petition.  The Petition not only mischaracterizes the
existing law, but also reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the way
in which the Internet operates and of the services now making use of the
     ACTA requests that the Commission stop firms such as the Respondents
from selling software that enables "a computer with Internet access to be
used as a long distance telephone, carrying voice transmissions, at
virtually no charge for the call" [ACTA Petition at i]. ACTA asserts that
such firms are common carrier providers of telecommunications services
that should not be allowed to operate without first obtaining a
certificate from the Commission [ACTA Petition at 6-7].
     That argument is wrong.  The Respondents provide their customers with
goods, not services.  Although the software that those firms sell does
enable individuals to originate voice communications, all of the actions
needed to initiate such communications are performed by the software
users, rather than the vendors.  At no time do the Respondents engage in
the "transmission" of information, which, according to the
Telecommunications Act of 1996, is the sine qua non of both a
telecommunications service and a telecommunications carrier. [See
Telecommunications Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-104, 110 Stat.  56, 3(a)
amending Section 153 of the Communications Act of 1934 to add new
definitions of "telecommunications,"  "telecommunications service," and
"telecommunications carrier."] In that critical sense, the Respondents are
no more providing telecommunications services than are the vendors of the
telephone handsets, fax machines, and other customer premises equipment
that make communications possible.
     ACTA also asks the Commission for a declaratory ruling "confirming
its authority over interstate and international telecommunications
services using the Internet." [ACTA Petition at 6.  While ACTA claims the
Commission has jurisdiction to regulate the Internet pursuant to Section 1
of the Communications Act, citing United States v. Southwestern Cable Co.,
392 U.S. 157 (1968), ACTA also acknowledges that such jurisdiction is
limited to actions ancillary to the effective performance of its specific
responsibilities under other parts of the Act.  Id. at 5,7-8.  ACTA
suggests that unregulated growth of the Internet presents "unfair
competition" to Title II regulated interexchange carriers that "could, if
left unchecked, eventually create serious economic hardship on all
existing participants in the long distance marketplace" and could be
"detrimental to the health of the nation's telecommunications industry and
the maintenance of the nation's telecommunications infrastructure."  Id.
at 4, 5. Voice telephony via the Internet, however, is still a limited and
cumbersome capability:  both parties to the call need computers and must
have compatible software.  Moreover, there is no assurance that a call
placed will be completed or not interrupted.  While the technology
involved may improve rapidly, presently there is no credible evidence to
justify Commission regulation of the Internet.] In fact, as the Federal
Networking Council pointed out in comments filed on May 4, there are no
telecommunications services currently being offered via the Internet.  The
services that now involve the Internet are more likely to be "enhanced,"
or information services over which the Commission has disclaimed
jurisdiction under the Communications Act.  The Commission decision in the
1980's not to regulate enhanced services was a wise one that has conferred
substantial benefits on American consumers.  The Telecommunications Act of
1996 in no way requires a change in that decision.
     The Internet now connects more than 10 million computers, tens of
millions of users, and is growing at a rate of 10-15 percent a month.
This growth has created opportunities for entrepreneurs to develop new
services and applications such as videoconferencing, multicasting,
electronic payments, networked virtual reality, and intelligent agents.
Perhaps more importantly, it creates a growing number of opportunities for
consumers to identify new communication and information needs and to meet
those needs.  The Commission should not risk stifling the growth and use
of this vibrant technology in order to prevent some undemonstrated harm to
long distance service providers.  If Internet-based services eventually
develop to an extent that raises concerns about harm to consumers or the
public interest, the Commission would have ample time to more fully
address the issue.  Now is not that time.
     NTIA, therefore, urges the Commission to reject the ACTA petition
without delay.

Next Wednesday, May 15, the House Judiciary Committee's Intellectual
Property Subcommittee is scheduled to consider amendments to, and
vote on approval of  HR 2441, the "National Information Infrastructure
Act of 1995."  Such approval, if given, would give an important boost to
passage of a legislative package heavily backed by -- and tilted in favor
of -- the movie, recording, and publishing industries (and other large
"content providers").  If passed in its current  form, the bill would:
*** make it a copyright violation to simply browse the Net without a
license from copyright owners;
*** subject computer system operators -- such as on-line services and
networks at schools and libraries -- to potentially crippling liability for the
copyright violations of their users, even if the operator;
*** cripple "distance education" efforts especially vital to rural
communities and the disabled; and
*** make it illegal to manufacture, import or distribute devices and
software (including computers and VCRs) needed by industry, schools
and libraries to make "fair use" of encrypted information by overruling
long-standing Supreme Court precedent.

Dear Representative__________:
     I am writing today to ask that you do everything in your power to assure
that no action is taken by the House Subcommittee on Intellectual Property on
the "NII Copyright Protection Act of 1995" (HR 2441) until a broad consensus
can be reached on how to resolve a number of issues of critical mportance to
me and, in my view, the future of the Internet.  As I understand it, this bill
in its current form, would seriously undermine the ability of businesses,
inventors, schools and librraies to make full use of the Internet's great
potential.  Specifically, H.R. 2441 would :
* make it a copyright violation to simply browse the Net without a license
from copyright owners;
* subject computer system operators -- such as on-line services and networks at
schools and libraries -- to potentially crippling liability for the copyright
violations of their users, even if the operator has no knowledge of such
* thwart "distance education" efforts especially vital to rural communities
and the disabled; and
* make it illegal to manufacture, import or distribute devices and
software (including computers and VCRs) needed by industry, schools and
libraries to make "fair use" of encrypted information by overruling long-
standing Supreme Court precedent.
     Please don't allow the fears of major copyright owning industries to
cripple the Internet for the rest of America.  I urge you and other members
of the House Judiciary Committee to take the time necessary to understand and
thoroughly debate all of the proposed amendments to H.R. 2441, including those
proposed by the Digital Future Coalition.
     Thank you very much for helping make the most of new technology and the
Internet to bring the benefits of information technology to all Americans, and
especially those in [INSERT THE NAME OF THE DISTRICT/CITY].

JAVA BLACK WIDOWS - SUN DECLARES WAR
Sun Microsystems' has declared war on Black Widow Java
applets on the Web. This is the message from Sun in response
to an extensive Online Business Consultant (OBC/May 96)
investigation into Java security.
OBC's investigation and report was prompted after renowned
academics, scientists and hackers announced Java applets
downloaded from the WWW presented grave security risks for
users. Java Black Widow applets are hostile, malicious traps set
by cyberthugs out to snare surfing prey, using Java as their technology.
OBC received a deluge of letters asking for facts after OBC
announced a group of scientists from Princeton University, Drew
Dean, Edward Felten and Dan Wallach, published a paper declaring
"The Java system in its current form cannot easily be made secure."
The paper can be retrieved at
Further probing by OBC found that innocent surfers on the Web who
download Java applets into Netscape's Navigator and Sun's
HotJava browser, risk having "hostile" applets interfere with their
computers (consuming RAM and CPU cycles). It was also discovered
applets could connect to a third party on the Internet and, without the
PC owner's knowledge, upload sensitive information from the user's
computer. Even the most sophisticated firewalls can be penetrated . . .
"because the attack is launched from behind the firewall," said the
Princeton scientists.
One reader said, "I had no idea that it was possible to stumble on
Web sites that could launch an attack on a browser."  Another said,
"If this is allowed to get out of hand it will drive people away from the
Web. Sun must allay fears."
The response to the Home Page Press hostile applet survey led to the
analogy of Black Widow; that the Web was a dangerous place where
"black widows" lurked to snare innocent surfers. As a result the
Princeton group and OBC recommended users should "switch off"
Java support in their Netscape Navigator browsers. OBC felt that Sun
and Netscape had still to come clean on the security issues. But
according to Netscape's Product Manager, Platform, Steve Thomas,
"Netscape wishes to make it clear that all known security problems with
the Navigator Java and JavaScript environment are fixed in Navigator
version 2.02."
However, to date, Netscape has not answered OBC's direct questions
regarding a patch for its earlier versions of Navigator that supported
Java . . . the equivalent of a product recall in the 3D world. Netscape
admits that flaws in its browsers from version 2.00 upwards were
related to the Java security problems, but these browsers are still in use
and can be bought from stores such as CompUSA and Cosco. A floor
manager at CompUSA, who asked not to be named, said "its news to
him that we are selling defective software. The Navigator walks off our
floor at $34 a pop."
OBC advised Netscape the defective software was still selling at
software outlets around the world and asked Netscape what action was
going to be taken in this regard. Netscape has come under fire recently
for its policy of not releasing patches to software defects; but rather
forcing users to download new versions. Users report this task to be a
huge waste of time and resources because each download consists of
several Mbytes. As such defective Navigators don't get patched.
OBC also interviewed Sun's JavaSoft security guru, Ms. Marianne Mueller,
who said "we are taking security very seriously and working on it very
hard." Mueller said the tenet that Java had to be re-written from scratch or
scrapped "is an oversimplification of the challenge of running executable
content safely on the web. Security is hard and subtle, and trying to build
a secure "sandbox" [paradigm] for running untrusted downloaded applets
on the web is hard."
Ms. Mueller says Sun, together with their JavaSoft (Sun's Java division)
partners, have proposed a "sandbox model" for security in which "we
define a set of policies that restrict what applets can and cannot do---these
are the boundaries of the sandbox. We implement boundary checks---when
an applet tries to cross the boundary, we check whether or not it's allowed
to. If it's allowed to, then the applet is allowed on its way. If not, the
system throws a security exception.
"The 'deciding whether or not to allow the boundary to be crossed' is the
research area that I believe the Princeton people are working on," said
Mueller. "One way to allow applets additional flexibility is if the applet
is signed (for example, has a digital signature so that the identity of the
applet's distributor can be verified via a Certificate Authority) then allow
the applet more flexibility.
 "There are two approaches: One approach is to let the signed applet
do anything. A second approach is to do something more complex and
more subtle, and only allow the applet particular specified capabilities.
Expressing and granting capabilities can be done in a variety of ways.
"Denial of service is traditionally considered one of the hardest security
problems, from a practical point of view. As [Java's creator] James
Gosling says, it's hard to tell the difference between an MPEG
decompressor and a hostile applet that consumes too many resources!
But recognizing the difficulty of the problem is not the same as 'passing
the buck.' We are working on ways to better monitor and control the
use (or abuse) of resources by Java classes. We could try to enforce
some resource limits, for example. These are things we are investigating.
"In addition, we could put mechanisms in place so that user interface
people (like people who do Web browsers) could add 'applet monitors'
so that browser users could at least see what is running in their browser,
and kill off stray applets. This kind of user interface friendliness (letting
a user kill of an applet) is only useful if the applet hasn't already grabbed
all the resources, of course."
The experts don't believe that the problem of black widows and hostile
applets is going to go away in a hurry. In fact it may get worse. The
hackers believe that when Microsoft releases Internet Explorer 3.00 with
support for Java, Visual Basic scripting and the added power of its
ActiveX technology, the security problem will become worse. "There is opportunity for abuse, and it will become an enormous
problem," said Stephen Cobb, Director of Special Projects for the
National Computer Security Association (NCSA). "For example, OLE
technology from Microsoft [ActiveX] has even deeper access to a
computer than Java does."
JavaSoft's security guru Mueller agreed on the abuse issue: "It's going
to be a process of education for people to understand the difference
between a rude applet, and a serious security bug, and a theoretical
security bug, and an inconsequential security-related bug. In the case of
hostile applets, people will learn about nasty/rude applet pages, and
those pages won't be visited. I understand that new users of the Web
often feel they don't know where they're going when they point and click,
but people do get a good feel for how it works, pretty quickly, and I
actually think most users of the Web can deal with the knowledge that
not every page on the web is necessarily one they'd want to visit.
Security on the web in some sense isn't all that different from security
in ordinary life. At some level, common sense does come into play.
"Many people feel that Java is a good tool for building more secure
applications. I like to say that Java raises the bar for security on the
Internet. We're trying to do something that is not necessarily easy, but
that doesn't mean it isn't worth trying to do. In fact it may be worth
trying to do because it isn't easy.  People are interested in seeing the
software industry evolve towards more robust software---that's the
feedback I get from folks on the Net."

telnetting to a UNIX shell. In selecting these, I generally excluded: ones in
authoritarian countries (e.g., China and Singapore); ones that appear to be
government-run; ones where they didn't appear to understand English very well;
ones in the European Community (except for a few such as Malta that don't
cooperate very well with the European Community); ones that charge for mail
volume; and ones that stated they did not run shell accounts. I did not
include offshore.com.ai in Anguilla due to its high cost; I consider anything
over 25$ a month to be impractical.

although one should still consider topics such as forensic stylometry - if

it may be possible to figure out who's who from these. I'm currently checking

intervetion because of the reserves of wealth the government is likely to have
for some time; they can afford to pay (using your and my tax dollars) for
the short-term costs to a subject. Paying for longer-term costs (e.g., the
loss of the ability to work due to reputational diminishment) is not as
practical, and is usually only done for very important cases (e.g., the
Witness Protection Program). An additional aspect of the last is that if
someone has a poor (or no) reputation, you shouldn't trust them with much
damaging information or responsibility. If government agents keep blowing
various covers, none of their covers will have much reputation capital.

have to be above-board - and thus subject to governmental pressure - or
anonymous - and thus not particularly trustworthy until they've built up
reputation capital. But how do they build up reputation capital in the first
place? Hmm.... what one needs is a way to transfer reputation from a public,
identifiable source to a new pseudonymous source. Some cryptographic thought
on this idea has been had; I will leave it up to the experts to discuss it.

Essentially, money-changing is likely to be a significant enough source of

                           _UPSET? TRY CYBERTHERAPY_
  _AN ONLINE VISIT TO THE PSYCHOLOGIST MAY PROVIDE AN ANSWER, CHEAP_
   Got the blues? Can't stop scarfing down bags of potato chips? Your
   spouse is always hostile, and you and the kids are, too? Therapy might
   help--at $125 a session. Or you could test a '90s solution: E-mail
   your way to mental health for a fraction of the cost.
   In the past year, angst has become a thriving niche on the World Wide
   Web. Many psychologists who are setting up home pages see electronic
   consultation as a way to plump up incomes hit by managed care and to
   attract new patients to the office. For the most part, these
   cyberpractitioners are careful to warn potential patients that the
   medium doesn't allow for detailed probing. "I give advice like Ann
   Landers and Dear Abby do," explains Dorothy Litwin, a New York
   psychologist who specializes in substance abuse, women's issues and
   couples therapy.
   Litwin is one of five women who joined forces about a year ago to form
   an electronic practice, Shrink-Link (address, box, Page 83). Four are
   New York State-licensed psychologists; one is a psychiatrist. Each has
   her own regular practice and specializes in a particular area of
   psychotherapy. For $20--you pay upfront by typing in your credit card
   number--you can send off your 200-word (or less) question; it is then
   routed to the appropriate therapist. Within 72 hours (often within 24
   hours), you get back two or three paragraphs of privately E-mailed
   advice.
   _ The short answer._ The cybercouch is most effective at giving people
   who can clearly identify the dilemma (my daughter is anorexic; I'm
   deep in debt and can't stop spending) a start toward a solution. A
   typical Shrink-Link question: "My 5-year-old was diagnosed with
   attention deficit disorder (ADD) in 1993 and has been on Ritalin ever
   since. She has been having trouble falling asleep for the past several
   months and has been moodier than usual of late. What do you think?"
   The gist of the response: "Some trial and error is often required
   before the correct dosage and timing are found, and symptoms such as
   sleep disturbance and moodiness often occur in the interim. Moreover,
   since children's rates of metabolism change, dosages often need to be
   adjusted. Even if the dosage is correct, the behavior irregularities
   you describe could be caused by administering the drug too late in the
   afternoon or by a host of other factors, such as nighttime fears.
   These possibilities need to be ruled out one by one until the culprit
   is found."
   The advice could well be to seek face-to-face counseling. E-mail
   exchanges are no basis for a diagnosis, for example, warns Marlene
   Maheu, a San Diego clinical psychologist who headed the American
   Psychological Association's subcommittee that recently looked into the
   ethics of cybertherapy. "It's impossible to get an anonymous patient's
   complete family history in a 200-word question," she says. And without
   such cues as voice tone, facial expressions and body language, how can
   a therapist be sure what the problems really are? "Smiley screen faces
   are a poor substitute for real communication," agrees Leonard Holmes,
   a therapist based in Newport News, Va., who says his online services
   are not therapy but "E-mail discussions." ("It's a bit more private
   than a call-in radio show," he notes.) Holmes charges $1.50 per minute
   and will spend as much time "with" a patient as the patient desires.
   Maheu's subcommittee and other psychology professionals worry that a
   lack of standards makes people seeking online help vulnerable. "When
   you are answering questions by E-mail, it's tempting to stray beyond
   your area of expertise," says Maheu. "The APA's ethical principles
   prohibit that." Critics also worry that confidentiality is at risk.
   While patients remain anonymous, a hacker could conceivably identify
   them. And these Internet sessions aren't encrypted. "You have no way
   of knowing who is printing the E-mail message out or where it is
   stored," says Thomas Nagy, a psychologist and Stanford University
   School of Medicine psychiatry professor. Nagy also worries that people
   with really significant problems will stop with an online Band-Aid.
   Troubling, too, is the fact that patients may know little about the
   therapist and his or her qualifications. Many sites don't disclose
   details about the counselors' experience and where they earned their
   credentials. Leonard Holmes, by contrast, provides a complete
   biography on his Web page that includes his educational background,
   what state he is licensed in, as well as areas of expertise. That way,
   interested patients can check out his professional background before a
   session.

      FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION WORKSHOP ON CONSUMER PRIVACY
              IN CYBERSPACE TO BE HELD IN JUNE 1996
     The Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Consumer Education
will hold a public workshop on June 4 and 5 to focus on privacy
issues in the online marketplace.  The development of technologies
such as the Internet and the World Wide Web has allowed online
businesses to collect and use personal information about consumers,
often without consumers' knowledge or consent.  The workshop
will examine consumer privacy issues in this new marketplace,
consumer and business education about the use of personal
information online, and ways to enhance the growth of the online
marketplace by fostering consumer confidence.      Workshop topics will include the use of consumer information,
the use of medical and financial information online, the collection
and use of information about children, electronic approaches to
protecting consumer privacy online, and the European Union's
directive on the protection of personal data.
     The workshop will be open to the public and will be held on
June 4, 1996 from 9:00AM to 5:00PM in Room 432 of the FTC
headquarters building, 6th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., in
Washington, D.C.  On June 5, 1996 the workshop will be held from
9:00AM to 12:30PM in Room 332 of the FTC headquarters building.       The Bureau invites representatives of consumer groups,
industry, government agencies, and other groups to take part in the
workshop.  Any person wishing to be considered for participation in
the public workshop must file a written request, on or before May
24, 1996, to Martha Landesberg, Division of Credit Practices,

multiple remailers all using the same output account for messages. Extensions
on this idea would be having them use it only for ones going to other than
another remailer, to prevent the traffic from being noticed (if lots of
traffic to remailers is coming out of one account, someone's going to
notice...). Several people could run such output accounts, sending encrypted
data on how to access the latest one(s) to (a subset of) remailer operators.
(I say a subset in order to stop the NSA from running a remailer and letting,
say, AOL know about each new output account on AOL. If some remailer or
group of remailers wasn't told about a new output account, and the output
account lasted statistically significantly longer (controlling for level of
output), then that'd be cause for suspicion.) Which one was used for any
given message through a particular remailer could be randomly chosen from
those that remailer knew.

the postage going to the output account owner instead of to the remailer, or
two items of postage (one to the remailer, one to the output account owner), or
three items of postage (one to the first remailer in the chain, one to the

     It's a pleasure to be part of the panel this evening.  Ran told us
about the problematique and Sally told us about one way to re-engage
people with the economy and society in general.  I am proposing one
way to get at the productivity of the new economy so that income can be
distributed to those who are no longer working.
     My talk is "New Taxes For A New Economy."  Many of the ideas
expressed by me this evening first appeared in a paper that Ran Ide and
I co-authored for a meeting of the Club of Rome last year.  Called The
New Wealth of Nations,the paper dealt with ways of getting at the
productivity of information technologies.  Creating a new source of
revenues that can be used in a variety of ways, including re-distribution
as income.
     First a bit of history.  As you all know in the not too distant past--
before 1900--most people worked in agriculture.  When automation of
one sort or another took place, people moved off the land to the new
jobs opening up in manufacturing.  Over the next decades automation of
one sort or another took place and people moved to the new jobs
opening up in the service sector.  Now that the service sector is itself
being automated, it is not clear where workers go.  Where do people find
work in an increasingly automated world?
     My view is that information technology is like no other.  It is
energy saving, capital saving and labour saving.  It is also distance
insensitive.  It can replace people in a great number of functions. Remembering, deciding, judging, estimating, counting, etc., can all be
done by information technologies, and can be done better, faster and
cheaper than by people.
     So I  think that we are going into a time of innovation and greatly
increased productivity throughout the economy.  Jobs will grow, but at a
much slower rate.  A short-hand way of saying this is that we'll be
seeing 'jobless growth.'
     Rather than seeing this as a disaster, I prefer to see it as an
opportunity.  After all the industrial revolution--the development of
steam power, electricity, the internal combustion engine--was all about
eliminating work, not creating work.  The industrial revolution was
about releasing people from dangerous, hard and mind-numbing work.
     You know in the 'old days' a job was a means to an end because
that is how people got income.  In the past few decades job creation has
become an end in itself because this is how income can be distributed. While there are many important social and psychological benefits in
having a job---job creation can be a very costly way to distribute income.      So in the debate and discussion about the future of work my
position is that the issue is income, not jobs.       In my view we need to get consensus on a positive vision of the
New Economy.  One possible positive vision is that the New Economy
will be one where few people work in traditional ways.  It will be an
economy that is VERY infotech intensive and highly productive--but the
new wealth created by the productivity is distributed as income in new
and novel ways.  Anything wrong with aiming toward this sort of
     But how do we get income to people who are no longer working in
the traditional areas of society?
     I think that we have to go back and take a closer look at the tax
system.  If everything else is changing with information technologies and
the New Economy, I think the tax system itself deserves a closer look.
     Today in Canada we are wringing our hands at the lack of tax
revenues.  Some of the tax concerns pre-date the 'new economy' and
carry over from the recent past: tax breaks to small business; a growing
underground economy based on cash; transnational companies who
'transfer price' in ways so that profits are declared in low tax areas of the
world; the rise of tax havens.
     The tax base is also threatened by the labour displacing capacity of
new technologies.  More and more services are the result of people
interacting with computer-based interfaces including touch-tone phones
connected to digital networks.  As do it yourself banking, shopping,
libraries, etc., take hold, the number of people displaced increases. Although this adds to the over-all productivity of the system, the
workers who lose jobs no longer pay taxes, rather they make demands
on the system for income support of one kind or another.       What happens to the productivity gains created by digital
networks?  Some gains show up in profits, some show up in lowered
prices, some goes to domestic labour and some to domestic capital--some
is 'lost' in the networks. In some cases off-shore capital benefits from
productivity advances.
     While part of the increased productivity may show up in earnings
to firms adopting the technology, to banks, to telecom firms or other
network operators, it appears that some of the productivity gains just
disappear.  It is either a non-monetary item (eg., time saved in using
ATMs for banking) or the productivity is diffused over so many
domestic and foreign players that it is not appropriated effectively, if at
all.       The challenge is to access the new productivity.  There is a strong
case to be made that government has not fully accessed the new wealth. That government has not yet realized where and how wealth creation is
taking place.  That government has not yet figured out a way to tax and
re-distribute some of the new wealth created by global digital networks.      By viewing the new economy through the prism and mindset of
the old economy we are unable to see just how wealthy and productive
the economy has truly become. Outdated ways of looking at the
economy have led us to neglect the new wealth.  We are neglecting the
new productive capacity created by and carried on global networks. Digital networks that provide so much of the new wealth also provide a
way for us, through our governments, to get at some of the productive
potential of a knowledge-based economy.       Over two hundred years ago Adam Smith wrote about the Wealth
of Nations.  He concluded that wealth was based on the division of
labour and the extent of the market.  Today we can add something else
to society's production function: knowledge, information and
communications.       The new wealth of nations is to be found in the trillions of digital
bits of information pulsing through global networks.  These are the
physical/electronic manifestation of the many transactions, conversations,
voice and video messages and programs that, taken together record the
process of production, distribution and consumption in the new
economy.       Digital flows are the new element of production whether in the
form of entertainment such as movies and video games; or, in the form
of financial management such as electronic commerce for business and
automatic tellers for the average citizen; or, in systems designed to
control aircraft traffic in the skies and baggage distribution on the
ground below; or, in managing the maze of telephone calls, faxes, e-mail
and charge card accounts that characterize life in this latter part of the
twentieth century.
     The suggested new tax is a turnover tax on interactive digital traffic. This new tax would be similar to a gasoline tax or paying a toll on a
bridge or toll road or having a license plate on a car.  These current
excise and indirect taxes apply by weight of truck, by amount of gas
used, not on the value of the commodity carried by the truck. Moving
from the old highway to the metaphor of the new highway,  my
proposal is to tax the digital traffic on the Information Highway.       Proposed is an easily administered tax on each digital bit of
information.  A 'bit tax.'  Whether the digital bit is part of a foreign
exchange transaction, a business teleconference, an Internet e-mail or file
transfer, electronic check clearance or an ATM transaction, each bit is a
physical manifestation of the new economy at work.  Whether the tax is
levied on the traffic carried by a fibre optic cable or on micro-wave or
whether the tax is levied on interactive satellite traffic, the bit tax
presents a way of accessing the  new wealth being created by the New
Economy.       The bit tax would be applied to value added interactive digital
transactions.  Interactivity makes the transaction valuable.  A broadcast
message may or may not add value, that is if it is heard.  An interactive
transaction: a conversation, data search, accessing an ATM--is an activity
you choose to do because it does something for you.  You get something
for doing it, you get something out of doing it:  otherwise you wouldn't
be do doing it.   It is this new value, this new productivity that is
creating so much new wealth in networks.
     All interactive digital information would be subject to the new tax. Thus digital broadcast and digital radio (all 'one to many' broadcasts)
would be exempted from the tax.  Digital broadcasts of one to few eg.,
TV broadcast to a few stations for later rebroadcast, or newspaper
transmission by satellite to remote printing plants are interactive (because
they are 'addressable') and would be subject to the bit tax.
     The bit tax would not be a user pay tax.  Increased use by a region
would however result in higher bit taxes.  So without getting into too
complex a discussion, one could imagine that at the local level an
average of digital traffic would be measured by designated region (this
could be by area code, metro area, province or state, or nation). This
statistical average would provide the basis for the bit tax rate at the
designated local level.  Leased lines would pay some percentage of the
carrying capacity of the line while long distance public lines would be
metered by usage patterns.
      To summarize: the implementation of the tax would fit into three
broad categories:
        1.    Long-distance lines (general public), a tax directly
              proportional to digital flows between major long-distance
              nodes in the country.
        2.    Leased lines (private lines), a fixed rate dependent on the
              bit-carrying capacity of the line.
        3.    Local Traffic, a variable rated based on a statistical average
              of gross information flows captured at each local switch
              using software already in place.
        The bit tax will be transparent.  It will be something metered
'out there' and remitted to governments.  It will vary with the collective
usage of networks.  Use of the system by any one individual will not
affect the amount of taxes being collected.  So it won't be a user-pay tax.      At what rate should nations tax digital bits?  How would the new
taxes be collected?  For sake of argument, the bit tax could be .000001
cents per bit.  Automatically collected it would cause fewer collection
problems than most other direct or indirect taxes. Collected by the
telecom carriers, satellite networks and cable systems the revenues would
flow directly to the national revenue service of the respective country.          Much work has to be done on the burden or incidence of this
new tax.  Is the tax progressive or regressive?  Will it be absorbed by the
carriers or will it be passed on to consumers?  Can one nation enact a bit
tax or does it have to a collaborative venture?  Perhaps through the
OECD or the G-7 group of nations.  And what about the tax rate itself? Is it too high or not high enough?  If the tax of .000001 cents per bit
yields too much revenue, then it can always be adjusted.          The 'bit tax' is one way to begin to deal with the dilemma of
increasing productivity and declining employment.  It represents a new
tax base that is at the heart of the new economy.  It is also a new tax
base that is growing.  It is a tax base that can be easily identified, one
where collection is in few hands.  In the New Economy it would be a tax
that is difficult to avoid.
        At a European Community meeting last year, the US
Ambassador to the US mission, Stuart Eizenstat, said the issues
surrounding the quality and quantity of available jobs in the New
Economy will not be solved by a conference here or a workshop there. He noted that we are facing a major change in our economies. The
change will not be easy or smooth: just as the cold war took many years
to resolve peacefully, so too will the transition to the new economy take
years of discussion, dialogue and new methods of conflict resolution.
        So the bit tax itself is just a modest beginning.  We need to go
further: to re-think the notion of employment as a method of income
distribution; to re-think the quest for ever more energy-intensive
economic growth in a time of environmental limits.  We need to re-think
much of our economic theory.
        But as a modest beginning, the bit tax is one way for all of
society to profit and benefit from the development of new technology. The bit tax can help provide the new fiscal framework to distribute the
productivity of the new economy as income when the job link is
disconnected...When Jobless Growth becomes the rule.
        Thank-you for your attention. I look forward to your questions,
comments and discussion.

was copyright-violating anyway, would he/she be negligent to send it on?  for "harrassing" email, not to avoid copyright problems. I'm not sure if there
is anything that could be done to avoid the copyright problems, aside from the
disposable output addresses with multiple remailers using them. (One
possible problem with these is that it could be argued that the remailer
operators sending to such addresses can read over the mail before encrypting it
to the front end and check to see if it's a copyright violation. However, they
would appear to be covered by the exemptions that should be in the copyright
law, namely for ISPs - if they aren't covered, then the Net is dead anyway.)
One method around this would be for the initial user to specify the output
address - or, preferably, input address that outputted to multiple different
output addresses - to use, and encrypt the message for that addresss. However,
this would require common knowledge of the input addresses, which could lead
to their being shut down quickly or the owner being held liable. One could have
a group of input/output providers with a common public/private key for the
initial user to use for the final encryption, although then you'd need to be
careful about who you let into this group.

they're used. The purpose of concealing from all but a trusted group (remailer

as possible. If it takes someone (NSA or whatever) repeatedly sending messages

for traffic analysis, especially by other parties) than if the output end's
address were immediately made public knowledge. This can be helped by the

coercive forces (e.g., monopolistic and ogliopolistic companies) from having

someone on a basis other than rational information. If someone refuses to hire
me for a job necessitating calligraphy, they aren't discrimiating against me
or other people with bad handwriting (including those, like me, who have that
due to neurological problems). They're being rational. A health insurance
company that judges who should be insured by that company on the basis of
whether the person is likely to get sick is surely being rational. A credit

whether that person is likely to declare bankrupcy is surely being rational.
business what it does with its dollars. It's analogous to the problem of
not allowing people to freely contract not to sue, as in remailers. While it
might be considered stupid for someone to do so - particularly in hindsight,
when they're claiming that they should be able to do so - the person should
still be allowed to do so.
you have insurance companies that are required to accept everyone at an equal
price. The ones who have information - denied to the insurance company - that
they're going to get sick will sign up more than the ones who won't. Take
Huntington's as an example. If genetic screening is prohibited to insurance
companies, someone who has a test and finds out that they've got the allele
for Huntington's, and thus will get sick and die from it, is going to go down
and get themselves insurance. Then the insurance - e.g., everyone else who
buys from that insurance company - will have to pay for them when they need
several years of nursing care before dying. How is this fair to everyone else,
including the insurance company?
who is bigger physically will have to spend more on food to keep alive than
someone who is small. Does that argue for socialization of food, so that
those who are big (partially a genetic trait) won't have to pay any more? Some
people are smarter than others. Does that mean that the ones who are smart
should be handicapped artificially to make everything fair?
gut instincts - not a valid argument - or philosophical ones, generally
Rawls' Theory of Justice. That one has a problem. Rawls thought that the
most just social system was that which a group of people would come up with
when they didn't know what position they'd be in. This would lead to equality,
since nobody'd want to be in the low position, right? Wrong. People can
rationally take a chance. If you give someone a choice between gambling for
(on the flip of a 50/50 coin) 150 or 0 dollars, and getting 50 dollars
guaranteed, the rational choice is the gamble. In other words, if it is more
efficient - as I have argued - for things to be unequal, then this idea of
what justice is would argue for inequality being just.

working properly, it should be impossible to prove that a given first remailer
was the first remailer for any particular message. I had thought that even
civil courts required that you be the person who committed some act, not the
person who _might_ have committed some act. Otherwise, all the remailers are
in danger. This is even if someone tries an entrapment by sending through some
illegal material - if the courts accept that they should be allowed to do this,
then all the remailers they chained are going to be hit.

has no motivation to protect the remailers. They've got a motivation to protect
ISPs, and thus may put in protections for them regarding liability.

jurors to have a college degree. If the defendant is someone with a Ph.D.,
require the jurors to have a Ph.D. or similarly high equivalent (J.D., M.D.,

being talked about (I've given presentations to _graduate_ school seminars in
which I went well over the heads of everyone in the class - including the
professor - after spending maybe four weeks working on the project), it does
increase the chance that they're at least teachable.

an indeterminate (from the perspective of those who don't have all the phrases)

pull up a subset of them and realistically claim that that's all of them.

paying into a trust fund with duress provisions. As an example, I might set
up an offshore company in Anguilla which was owned by a trust fund; I would
be the initial trustee for this trust fund, and Vince Cate might be the
backup trustee if I was put under any duress (e.g., legal problems). Since I
would have some costs for the initial setup of such an operation, I would deem
it perfectly reasonable for the trust fund to owe me some money, which it would
then pay me back as interest on this loan.

because they won't have the political motives (e.g., Senator Harkin holding
up Greenspan's confirmation because Greenspan doesn't produce enough inflation
for Harkin's voters' liking) to have inflation that governmental agencies do.

the effects of the inflation-indexed bonds that the Treasury Dept looks to be
coming out with soon. If there's enough inflation for people to be interested,
and those people trust the government, then people will move their capital from
more liquid areas (e.g., bank accounts) into these (as well as from existing
governmental bonds). This reduces the value of money, since less people want to
hold it in liquid form (for one thing, if inflation is a concern, you might as
well go ahead and spend money) and there is more of it in that liquid form -
democratically-elected governments that get this money are going to spend it or
use it to reduce taxes. That means the rate of inflation will increase...
meaning the government will have to pay out more on the bonds, and those
buying the bonds (or, preferably, moving to other currencies) will increase.
Such bonds are normally created by governments with high inflation rates -
usually prior to a hyperinflationary collapse. It's an interesting question
whether this is cause or effect - likely both.

While multiple remailers on the same machine isn't ideal for this purpose (if
root is cracked, they all are cracked), it's better for this aspect than 1
remailer; root can be assumed to be harder to crack than a non-root-account
remailer. Moreover, this is assuming one machine, or an interlinked group of
machines set up such that there is one root account for all of them; separating
the remailers into machines with different roots would help. The rubber-hose

with Uni over email a couple of days ago, and he reminded me of the possibility
of them doing this through an account that wasn't obviously theirs, then
claiming the initial remailer operator was negligent in not filtering the mail.
The way to counter this is to only accept mail that's already encrypted to
another remailer (i.e., Mixmaster with outgoing mail from non-remailers only
to other remailers). If the judge is going to find a remailer operator
responsible for the content of material he/she can't even read, then the
remailer network is dead in its present form anyway.
may need to send only encrypted mail to the transient end point(s), and the
end points may need to be anonymous both in input and output. If the last
remailer can read the material, then the Co$ or whoever can argue that they
should filter it. The end point has to be able to read it for public messages
(I'm not counting encrypted posts meant for one or a few people as public
messages) to go out, so the end point would be vulnerable to lawsuits, etcetera
if its identity were known.
point, and sending it to that end point encrypted for that end point. Since
a well-known end point (e.g., everybody knows where to send mail to) is likely
to get shut down quickly (much more so for its input end than would otherwise
be the case, if the input and output ends are separate), I would suggest having
the ephemeral end point owners send an appropriately encrypted message to the
remailer operators, or (preferably) to a subset of them (thus being able to
spot any corrupted remailer who consistently blows the gaff). This message
would contain the public key for an end point or set of end points, a random
number associated with that public key (although a KeyID or fingerprint might
do instead), plus input end addresses for each of the end points run using that
public key; this would all be signed with the public key in question. (Having
it on the keyservers so as to build up reputation through signatures would be
good in addition, with some appropriate pseudonymous UserID to link it with).
Remailer users would then get the random number plus its associated public
key upon mailing a remailer with an appropriate help request. If a remailer
received for output a number it didn't recognize, I would suggest remailing
the information - encrypted appropriately - to another remailer. One additional
advantage of this system would be that the end users wouldn't need to know
about changes in input end points - their mail would simply go to whichever
of the available input end points corresponding to that public key & random
number that that remailer knew and happened to randomly select.
I forgot to save the posting from someone who had commented about AOL sending
out lots of membership kits with free net time - useful for ephemeral end
points, although the anonymnity would be a problem. It might be interesting to
find out what mailing lists they're getting their lists from - magazines
catering to the middle+ classes is my guess.

Notes on network computers, blind copies, democratic culture, monopolies,
and the idea of an Internet establishment...
As a periodic reminder, a Web archive of nearly all the RRE messages ever
sent can be found through  It turns out that the article on cryptography by Bruce Schneier that I
forwarded from the Risks Digest the other day was actually an unfinished
draft that Peter Neumann sent out by mistake.  Bruce asks that everyone
refrain from propagating that version around the net.
Steve Lohr's article on the "network computer" in Monday's New York Times
includes the following priceless quotes:
  The line between these network computers being used as really effective
  corporate tools and being used as mind-control tiger cages is a fine
  one.  There will be a real temptation for corporate managers to go too
  far in the direction of control.
    -- Paul Saffo
  The paradise of shared knowledge and a more egalitarian working
  environment just isn't happening.  Knowledge isn't really shared because
  management doesn't want to lose authority.

  What's a floppy disk?  It's a way to steal company secrets.
    -- Scott McNealy

I wish we could rewind this whole computer revolution thing and start over.
Non-Americans keep remarking on the predominance of American items on
RRE.  That's simply a function of the items that RRE subscribers send me.
If you come across interesting items from other countries, I hope you'll
consider sending them along.
A while back, I came across an op-ed column addressed to teen-agers which
purported to explain certain points about life.  The first of these points
was, and I quote,
  Life's not fair.  Get used to it.
All of the points were like this: each of them presupposed that their
reader held a putatively naive or self-serving opinion about life,
and they proposed to set the reader straight in a remarkably nasty and
disrespectful way.
I view this article as part of a larger and very depressing trend: the
return of authoritarian culture.  The purpose of authoritarian culture
is to instil a mindless obedience to authority.  It employs two basic
methods.  The first of these methods is stereotype: one's normal human
tendencies to think critically and oppression resist are caricatured
and ridiculed; endless stories are adduced to portray people who employ
these innate faculties in a bad light; and labels such as "whining" and
"complaining" and "victim" are liberally applied.
The second method of authoritarian culture is the attempt to naturalize
authority by hiding it behind large abstractions.  In this case, the
abstraction in question is "life".  Having established that "life" is
unfair, it becomes possible to label any protest against unfairness as
a demand that the whole world conform to one's own immature whims.  These
teenagers are counseled to "get used to it" and to reconcile themselves to
a life of being treated unfairly.  No liberal nostrums about self-esteem
here: this columnist's message was that nobody deserves to be treated with
respect, and that it's arrogant to think otherwise.
Another example of authoritarian culture is the contemporary American
use of the word "accountability".  Accountability, we are told, means
"accepting the consequences of your actions".  Everyone is supposed
to "be accountable", and to embrace this condition as a concomitant of
responsible adulthood.  Authority here is hidden through a grammatical
device.  In normal usage, the word "accountable" takes a complement,
as in "accountable to ...".  When the complement is omitted, the human
authority is displaced into the woodwork, and obedience to that authority
is conflated with a variety of quite different conditions: responsibility,
honesty, etc.  No reasonable person has a problem with the idea of being
responsible for one's actions.  But nobody who believes in a democratic
society can accept the idea that any person has absolute authority to
judge any other person's actions, and hand down "consequences", without
likewise being constrained by norms of responsibility, which in the old
days were called "justice" and -- yes, that's right -- "fairness".
It is not surprising when people in authority employ such language.  But
authoritarian culture requires more: it requires that people internalize
this language, applying it to themselves and dissociating all desire for
justice and fair treatment.  We all have our failings, but we we cannot
have a decent society unless everyone is treated with respect and judged
with a reasonable regard for proportionality and due process.  Healthy
people don't just "get used to" injustice.  Quite the contrary, genuine
maturity begins with the skill and discipline of helping people organize
to identify and overcome injustice.  Shame and ridicule are the least
violent of the tools that have historically been employed to condemn
people to passivity.  But they are also the most basic and, in the end,
the most destructive.
The basic method for promoting an extreme position is to harp on the evils
of the opposite extreme.  Authoritarian culture thus lives in a symbiotic
union with its evil twin, libertarian culture, whose sole value is freedom
from constraint.  The symbiosis between authoritarian and libertarian
culture has many facets:
 * Authoritarian culture holds that people are essentially bad and that
nothing can be done about this; libertarian culture holds that people
are essentially good and that nothing needs to be done to encourage this.
 * Authoritarian culture imposes constraint without respect for individual
dignity; libertarian culture holds that individual dignity consists in the
absence of constraint.
 * Authoritarian culture holds that people are innately irresponsible;
libertarian culture denounces responsibility as an authoritarian myth.
 * Authoritarian culture and libertarian culture both conflate feelings
with action, authoritarian culture to repress them both and libertarian
culture to license them both.   * Authoritarian culture crushes the spirit and eventually gives rise to
an immature impulse toward libertarian culture; libertarian culture stands
indifferent as great industries arise to support an epidemic of addiction,
which then gives rise to a fearful impulse toward authoritarian culture.
What authoritarian and libertarian have in common is their claim to follow
a simple, objective rule that lies beyond human interpretation: the rule
of order or the rule of freedom.  The terra incognita that lies beyond
the dysfunctionality of both authoritarian and libertarian culture is
democratic culture: the form of culture within which everyone takes
responsibility for living together constructively.  Democratic culture
is not just a matter of voting.  It is a set of values, and it is a
set of skills.  Some of these skills are organizational: you can't have
democratic culture unless people know, deep down in their bones, how to
hold a productive consensus-based meeting.  Other skills are emotional:
you can't have democratic culture unless people can tell the difference
between resisting oppression and acting out resentment, between organizing
and polarizing, between freedom and irresponsibility, between pleasure and
addiction, between discipline and shame, between personal boundaries and
passive aggression.
The sixties have left an ambiguous legacy because they blurred together
two very distinct impulses: countercultural libertarianism, for which I
don't have an awful lot of respect, and democratic experimentation, for
which I have a great deal of respect.  Recreational drug use, for example,
is stupid and boring.  But the democratic organizing traditions that arose
and flourished in the sixties were an important cultural contribution, and
it's sad to see them forgotten.  The rise of authoritarian culture depends
on this forgetting, and on crushing at an early age the hopes for human
dignity with which all of us are born.
Why isn't this obvious?  One reason is that the American conservative
movement originated as a marriage of convenience between authoritarians
and libertarians, both of whom portrayed themselves as opponents of
something called "government".  But opposition to government tout court
is opposition to democracy.  We have been inundated in recent years by
rhetoric that seeks to make democracy literally unthinkable by conflating
all types of government, whether democratic or totalitarian, into a
single stereotype of oppression.  This stereotype requires its proponents
to construct themselves as powerless victims, and it licenses all sorts
of whining and complaint by the very people who make a big point of
censuring whining and complaint by others.  By treating the institutions
of a democratic society as inherently beyond control, it also licenses
an abdication of personal responsibility -- the responsibility to learn,
practice, and teach the values and skills of a democratic society.
Back in the Later Middle Ages, around 1994, I often found myself lectured
by experts who asserted that great bureaucratic institutions, government
and corporate alike, would necessarily and inevitably disintegrate in the
world of the Internet.  It's almost 1997 now, and as the months go by I
find it ever harder to remember why this great disintegration was supposed
to take place.  If evidence counts for anything, we are actually living
in an unprecedented era of concentration and centralization.  ABC has now
become the Disney Infomercial Channel, and British Telecom is buying MCI.
And the more I learn about Internet economics, the more the Internet seems
like a veritable engine of monopoly-creation.  The reasons are numerous.
Most of them are explained in the recommendations and bibliographies that
I have provided in past issues of The Network Observer, and any one of
them would suffice:
 * The Internet backbone business, like any other utility, involves high
fixed costs and low marginal costs of serving additional customers, so
that bigness is highly rewarded.  And every provider has an incentive to
give priority to packets that remain within its network, thus giving a
quality-of-service advantage in the market to whichever provider first
establishes a dominant position in a given segment of the market for
network services.
 * The pattern of high fixed costs and low marginal costs is even stronger
for software: if two software products compete then the price of each is
determined by its development costs divided by the number of customers.
As a result, other things being equal, the company with the larger market
share completely destroys its competition.  If other things aren't equal,
a company with an existing flow of monopoly rents can simply give away its
products until its competitors' capital is depleted.
 * And then there are de facto standards: the dynamics of standards are
fantastically complicated, but the Internet still needs several additional
service layers, and even a single proprietary standard could give one
firm immense power to extract rents from Internet users and dictate future
directions for Internet architecture.  Since most of the forthcoming
standards will be implemented in software, the monopoly tendencies of the
software market will promote the rise of proprietary networking standards.
Past experience with the Internet is misleading: small players and ARPA
philosopher-kings can establish a new standard in the world if the big
players are asleep, but the big players are awake now.  In the future it
will take capital and speed to impose a standard, and winner takes all.
 * The economics of information -- "content" -- are no more reassuring.
Since information can be replicated cheaply, an overwhelming, life-or-
death incentive exists to leverage creative effort across as many channels
as possible.  Of course, every industry has an incentive to increase its
revenue.  But as the marginal cost of selling additional units approaches
zero, prices are directly determined by market share, thus giving rise to
a positive feedback loop and eventual monopoly.  This suggests that, to
the extent that the Internet is a vehicle for the delivery of information
commodities, it will necessarily be absorbed into the institutions of the
media system.  Nobody will be able to afford to produce a news service
that only operates on the Internet, for example, given that existing news
services can adapt their work to the Internet for much less than it costs
to produce a competing service from scratch.  And content providers who
already operate in other media will have a powerful incentive to adapt
their services to the Internet, provided only that additional money can
be made by providing those services in the Internet medium.
It is commonly argued that the Internet, by reducing transaction costs,
will cause organizations to break apart and industries to reorganize on a
more entrepreneurial basis.  I have argued this myself.  But the argument
doesn't work.  The Internet (and not only the Internet, but a world of
other technologies) reduces transaction costs and coordination costs
alike, making it less efficient to operate large organizations that cross
many disparate functions but more efficient to operate large organizations
that do one standardized thing.  Thus we have waves of both outsourcing
(due to decreased transaction costs) and concentration (due to decreased
coordination costs).  And high-tech industries increasingly favor those
firms that can see standards battles coming and prepare to fight them in
a coordinated way.
Other arguments against the monopoly scenarios have more force.  Internet
service provision is not yet a monopoly, and it is not obviously headed
in that direction right now.  Nobody understands the ISP business very
well, and it would appear that the smaller entrepreneurial firms have
an advantage in adaptability in an environment of rapid technological
and market change.  AT&T, moreover, would seem to be falling apart at
the seams in very much the fashion that Schumpeter, that patron saint
of entrepreneurs, would have predicted.  Even MCI has been hitting itself
on the head pretty hard during the last few years.  So my point is *not*
that the Internet is definitely going to be locked up by cigar-smoking
corporate titans.
My point is simply this.  It's almost 1997, and yet the airwaves and
magazine pages are still full of ideologues, still reciting old-wave
technological determinist mantras about how the Internet will inevitably
bring us a decentralized world of freedom.  Technological determinism,
however, is a kind of cargo cult: it asserts that we can obtain a happy
society if we simply work hard enough at idolizing the technology.  The
world doesn't work like that.  Significant forces are operating in several
directions, some of those directions are more pleasant to contemplate
than others, and the outcome is not preordained.  It seems to me that
the proponents of a totally unregulated economy should learn a little
more economics.  It also seems to me that it's time for a revival of
the democratic values that make it possible to imagine a conscious choice
about our technological future.
After my comment about the Journal of Internet Banking and Commerce
the other day, I got an irate message from the Journal's editor.  Among
his less extravagant suggestions was that I am a member of the Internet
establishment who has the power to destroy people with a word.  Gosh.
My first response was to wonder if Hallmark has a card for this occasion:
  To a childhood friend, after all these years
  I can still remember how, it seems
  You never picked me for your teams
  I have no idea now where you've went
  But I'm a member of the Internet establishment
  So you better watch out what you say
  Or with my keyboard I'll blow you away
Then I thought about it more seriously.  I'm not here to take shots at
struggling Internet publications, unless you count Slate.  My only goal
had been to plug the Scout Report, and the truth is that I was too lazy
to dig up an issue of TSR that I was 100% comfortable with.  I won't go
into the reasons for the opinion I formed of JIBC back in the spring,
since you can easily judge for yourselves.  Of course I should take
ordinary care not to slam people at random, and by trying to run this
list in odd moments of the day I'm all too likely to get careless.  The
harder question is, is this guy right?  Never mind that he had a grossly
exaggerated estimate of RRE's readership -- the idea that I am a member
of any kind of establishment is completely foreign to me.  Of course,
this could simply be a self-serving delusion.  After all, as a white
guy who was born in the United States, I enjoy numerous social privileges
that I have never earned.  And as a graduate student at MIT, my cohort and
I were located so close to the center of the post-WWII military-academic
complex that we had the resources to pretend that we were antiestablishment
nonconformists.  Still, if the Internet establishment exists and holds
councils, I have never been invited to them.  I have met some of the
publicly prominent Internet people once or twice and have found them to be
remarkably decent, but I hope you will agree that my message on RRE is not
particularly congruent with theirs.  Yes, I organized a CPSR conference a
few years back, but look what's happening to CPSR.
So, at the end of the day, am I basically just another guy with a mailing
list?  When I started RRE, I assumed that surely by now the Internet
would be crawling with filter lists such as my own.  But even though some
other excellent filter lists do exist, including some (David Farber's,
for example) with many more subscribers than my own, my assumption hasn't
come close to being true.  Why is this?  I can think of a few reasons:
 * Limited access to the tools.  The hardware keeps getting faster, but
   the software for maintaining mailing lists isn't much better than it
   was in 1993.  It's still impractical for 95%+ of Internet users to
   maintain large mailing lists.  This is a scandal.
 * Flexibility of the tools.  The assumption that lots of people would
   start filter lists depended on another, implicit assumption: that
   the Internet only supports a limited number of interesting mechanisms.
   Lots of people are doing great things on the Internet, and they have
   shaped tools to fit their particular visions, which simply differ
   from mine.  Even the other filter lists vary widely in their traffic,
   contents, respect for copyrights, and amplitude of editorial voice.
 * Network externalities.  As I mentioned the other day, it's possible
   that once a list like RRE establishes a large subscriber base, other
   lists will have a hard time getting enough traction to compete.  This
   is because the success of such lists depends in part on the number of
   subscribers they have, and I got the subscribers first.  On the other
   hand, 4300 is a small fraction of the total world of Internet users.
 * Critical mass.  RRE is mostly about the social and political aspects
   of networking and computing.  This is a fashionable topic, and it
   is a topic likely to appeal to a large proportion of Internet users.
   Someone who wanted to run a filter list devoted to medical issues,
   for example, would be limited by the number of Internet users in
   the medical field.  On the other hand, one major early source of RRE
   messages was Gleason Sackman's high-volume filter list on education.
I wish I could say that the Internet affords freedom of the press to those
who don't own one.  But it's not true, not yet.  So maybe, on some very
tiny scale, I'm an Internet analog of Rush Limbaugh or Scott Adams.  Those
guys could hardly be more different on one level, but they also reflect an
important convergence.  Rush didn't invent talk radio with its structured
listener involvement; the innovation of his show was that it's basically
about his opinions.  Dilbert didn't invent the comic strip; his innovation
was to use the Internet to involve his readers in thinking up the ideas.
In each case, the result is a voice that seems on the surface like a
synthesis of the star's voice with that of his audience, and the fear
is that this result is a sham, giving just enough of an appearance of
audience involvement to authenticate the star as the Voice of the People.
Likewise, by forever soliciting subscribers' submissions while exercising
absolute editorial control, I can imagine that this list conveys a sense
of omniscience that has little basis in reality.  As a recovering know-it-
all, I can testify how addictive this position can be.  I can imagine how
this list can be perceived as more authoritative than it really is.  And
since perceptions of authority are largely self-fulfilling, I can appreciate
how an RRE message can do more damage than it has any right to.  I don't
really know for sure, nor is it mine to judge.  But I suppose I should err
on the safe side.

of removal of DN for political reasons?
[Maybe the next Internet myth to bust up is this stuff about the Internet
being decentralized.  "Designed to survive a nuclear attack", etc etc.
I'm afraid it doesn't work like that.  The net has little redundancy, the
backbones are in the hands of a small number of large companies, and all
of the detailed mechanics of getting your packets to their destination are
fragile and prone to propagating errors.  The high levels of service to
which we've grown accustomed are due to the hard work of specific people,
not to the intrinsic properties of the machinery.  The net works because
those people are able to do the right thing.  The conditions that *let*
them do the right thing may disappear next month, or the month after that.
So let's forget the technological determinism and lose our complacency
about the future, and instead have a little gratitude to the hackers who
make it work and a little political concern for the architectural choices
that are coming right up on the horizon.]

TEAM SELECTED TO DEVELOP DIGITAL OBJECT IDENTIFIER
SYSTEM FOR PUBLISHING INDUSTRY
The Association of American Publishers (AAP) today announced
selection of the team that will develop a Digital Object Identifier (DOI)
system for use by the publishing industry.  The team,  comprising
R.R. Bowker, a division of Reed Elsevier, Inc., and the Corporation
for National Research Initiatives (CNRI),  was chosen following a
competitive bidding process initiated last spring as part of AAP's
all-out effort to promote development of systems for managing
copyright in the digital environment.  Copyright management is
seen as the key to successful commercial use of the Internet by the
publishing industry.
The DOI project is the outgrowth of a year-long AAP initiative to
identify the needs of the publishing industry to facilitate safe and
successful commercial ventures on the Internet and in other networked
environments.   AAP's initial research revealed a fundamental need
for a unique, unambiguous way to identify digital materials-- a type
of "electronic license plate" for a "digital vehicle" traveling the
information superhighway. The Digital Object Identifier system will
serve that purpose.
The Bowker/CNRI team will focus on three key areas during the first
year: developing a numbering system for identifying digital objects
created by publishers; creating an agency for assigning publisher numbers;
and developing a network-based directory to link digital objects to
their publisher.   DOIs will be made accessible via a high-speed computer
system developed by CNRI--a scalable, distributed system on the Internet,
with open interfaces, allowing information about digital material to be
retrieved almost instantaneously.  R.R. Bowker will establish the
agency for making publisher numbers and other related information
available to any and all publishers.  Since the DOI system uses open
standards, publishers and other companies can build their own
products and services based around DOIs.
AAP President Nicholas Veliotes said that "In selecting the team to
develop a DOI system, AAP is taking a major step forward in the search
for viable, effective copyright management in the electronic
environment.  Our members see this as a top priority as the publishing
industry positions itself for the new Century."
Robert Badger (Springer Verlag NY), a member of AAP's Enabling
Technologies Committee and head of its DOI task force, pointed out:
"For people to buy and sell information on the Internet, the publishing
community needs two things which this announcement sets in motion.
First, we need a simple way to identify which piece of information
is being purchased; that's what the number does. Second, we need an
easy way for the reader to get current information about the digital
object--and this system will accomplish that by directing the reader's
question immediately to the right place in the publishing organization.
It's more than just a Universal Product Code for information; it's a
market-making mechanism."
Robert Kahn, President of CNRI and a recognized pioneer in the
development of the Internet, said "We are delighted that our technology
was selected for this important application. It will provide a key
component of the global information infrastructure and can serve
as a model for information access across many sectors of the economy."
R.R. Bowker's Publisher Peter Simon noted that "As the organization
that runs the ISBN Agency in the United States, and the publisher of
key tools for locating published materials (including the preeminent
Books in Print database), we are very pleased to be contributing our
experience and expertise to creating new standards for digital materials
and facilitating commerce on the Internet for the publishing industry."
The Association of American Publishers is the principal trade
association of the U.S. book publishing industry.  Its members publish
hardcover and paperback books in every field, including general
fiction and non-fiction, poetry, children's books, textbooks, Bibles,
reference works, scientific, medical, technical, professional, and
scholarly books and journals, and a range of educational materials
for the elementary, secondary, postsecondary and professional
markets.  AAP members also produce computer software and
electronic products and services, including online databases and
CD-ROM.  Among AAP's primary concerns is the protection of
intellectual property rights at home and abroad, in all media.
R.R. Bowker, a division of Reed Elsevier, Inc., is one of the foremost
U.S. bibliographic publishers, providing reference information to
libraries, booksellers, and publishers since 1872.   Its Books in Print
database is currently available in hard copy, CD-ROM, tape & site
license, and online.  In addition, Bowker is the independent agent
in the U.S. for the International ISBN and SAN systems.  The ISBN
is an identification system for books and other media which allows
for order processing by booksellers, libraries, universities, wholesalers
and distributors.  DOI project contact at Bowker is Maureen Adamson,
Vice President, Business Development--(908) 665-2856;
madamson at reedref.com.
The Corporation for National Research Initiatives is an
internationally recognized leader in information technology research
and development, with particular strength in networking, large-scale
information systems, and digital object infrastructure. A non-profit
organization formed in 1986 to foster research and development
for a national information infrastructure, CNRI has, since its
inception, been actively engaged in the establishment of open,
non-proprietary technological approaches for networked systems.

The remailer operators own the presses; why shouldn't they use whatever means
they see fit to determine how they can be used? I encourage people not to
discriminate on the basis of the political orientation of what's going
through... but spam isn't political speech. (I agree that the government
should not be in the business of determining what is spam and what is
political speech - all speech should be protected - but remailer operators
are not governments.)

physical) chaos won't increase entropy. But how about using it to make an
attacker work harder to use any flaws in your method of generating random
bits? As a simplistic example, say that the scribble window you're using tends
to result in a 1 for each 3rd bit. Nice and simple for an attacker to exploit.
But if that output is then fed into a chaotic system as its starting conditions,
and you then take the state of that system after a sufficient number of
iterations and use it as the basis for the IDEA key or whatever, the attacker
doesn't just have to search through all the IDEA keys with the third bits being
1's - they have to process each of those through the chaotic system and use
those results. Sort of like factoring - checking any two given prime factors
will be rather easy, it's just the sheer number you have to check that makes
things difficult. (This can be thought of as an odd variety of hash,
particularly if you do something like chopping off the most-significant-bit
in the chaotic system's output.)

comment about situations working out the best when only the parties involved
are involved in rulemaking. I'd agree... and remailer operators are among
the parties involved in these cases. This may be via direct individual pressure
(for remailers without front ends) or through conscience/social pressure (for
remailers with disposable front ends or chaining-only remailers), but they're
still involved.
There's the filtering of data into their appropriate categories - e.g., a
moderator of a mailing list deciding that something is off-topic _for that
list_, not for any discussion - and filtering of data into stuff that
should be transmitted and shouldn't be transmitted, even though, e.g., it's
on topic for a given mailing list.
something that government shouldn't do at all, and that makes in my view the
person doing such filtering responsible for _everything_ that they do let
through (preferably legally responsible). The first type is tricky enough to
tell from the second that I don't want government doing it, but I don't
discourage others from doing so.
to a situation where remailer operators won't have to deal with so much - e.g.,
expiration of some patents so that remailers can take digital cash. It's just
that I don't see pressure such as from spamming through remailers as helping
to get those improvements, all in all. Some of it may - e.g., encouragement of
dropping of inadequately secure remailers like anon.penet.fi (sorry, Julf), as
you mentioned - but this isn't the case for all of it.

this effort by government also a form of the pressure-by-economics we saw

using government purchasing to distort the market (away from anonymous
digital cash, in this case). The last statement also brings up the question

[For those of you who are just joining us, RRE has been following a
controversy in Ontario about the use of biometric encryption to identify
welfare applicants in Toronto for purposes of fraud prevention.  Critics
assert that welfare applicants are being criminalized under the cover of
combatting a fraud problem that doesn't really exist; supporters assert
that the new scheme would be less cumbersome for everyone involved than
the existing identification methods, and that, unlike most biometric
identification schemes, this encrypted scheme does not require the
applicant's fingerprint to be captured in a form that could be used for
law enforcement or other purposes.  The case is important because biometric
encryption is a leading example of the "privacy-enhancing technologies"
that will become increasingly important as a technical means to reconcile
functionality and privacy in technical systems.  I honestly do not know
which side is right, and I have friends among both supporters and critics
of such systems.]

this an article about fingerscanning that I wrote for University of Guelph's student newspaper, the "Ontarion", with lots of help from Orenda Davis and Jennifer Kohm.  It's not as comprehensive as the info doc, but maybe a tad more readable. sooooo please. forward. reprint. etc.
A new threat to the privacy and autonomy of all Canadians received government's stamp of approval over the summer when Metro Toronto Council approved a plan to fingerscan area welfare recipients. Politicians claim that this will cut costs by reducing welfare fraud, which is estimated at under 3% of Social Service expenditures. Social Justice advocates question the fairness
and fiscal responsibility of paying a consortium led by three large corporations, the Royal Bank, Great West Life Assurance Co., and Unisys Canada,
millions of dollars to develop the program when welfare fraud is such an insignificant problem. The decision seems particularly questionable since New Zealand recently abandoned a similar system, having found that its costs far outweighed its benefits.
A key reason for implementing the program, explains Metro's Human Services Committee report, is to make municipal Social Services compatible with provincial government plans to use biometric identification to "cover a range of programs". In Spain biometrics have been used for Unemployment benefits, and in the United States a bill was recently discussed that would have used it for a host of programs, including health care and immigration. Technology companies, such as Mytec, are promoting fingerscanning for these services in Canada as well.
Fingerscanning is often confused with fingerprinting, although there are substantial differences. In fingerscanning, a machine takes your fingerprint pattern and converts it into a unique set of numbers and letters. A central computer database holds these codes, which can be accessed by authorized groups. For Metro's plan, the system would be designed to catch people trying to receive extra benefits by applying for welfare under different aliases. The proposition raises the specter of corporate control over the welfare system by threatening to bring in private sponsorship. Metro Committee documents emphasize "the further exploration of the feasibility of C.I.B.S. [the fingerscanning plan] applications to other corporate initiatives." The Committee's suggestions for the future of the welfare system include "obtaining credits for our customers from various suppliers - supermarket chains, drug chains, educational institutions, dental clinics, property
 management companies, clothing stores.." Although this may sound fairly innocuous, it erodes the privacy and freedom of choice of people struggling below the poverty line.
Presently, program benefits like dental care only cover certain services, and are available to limited cash amounts. The Committee's report suggests that corporate credits, such as those from grocery or clothing stores, would be handled in the same way: the government would control both the type of goods individuals purchase and the amount they spend on food, education, and other necessities. It makes it possible for politicians to decide things like whether or not it is acceptable for poor people to buy cigarettes or junk food.
It is not inconceivable that in the future this power could deny low income people freedom over choices as personal as buying birth control.
 As well, those reliant on benefits would have to buy from corporate sponsors. It would be irrelevant if their prices were relatively expensive, their location inconvenient, or their policies in conflict with an individual's cultural or political values. Currently, the government records the location, time, and details of dental benefit transactions. It is likely that credits from drug stores and other corporate sponsors would be monitored in the same way. In spite of this, Metro Councilors are so enamored with the fingerscanning proposal that they are prepared to recommend it for nationwide use. Toronto's Department of Social Services even hopes to make some revenue off its expansion by selling the scheme to other jurisdictions.
The spread of biometric identification happened similarly in the United States.
In recent years, its use on welfare recipients has become increasingly prevalent. As the idea of biometrically identifying the public has become more socially accepted, federal politicians have started considering its usefulness for a myriad of services and personal information. In February, Congress discussed a bill that would have used fingerscanning to develop a centralized database containing personal information on every adult in the country. This data was to be made available to a variety of government and corporate interests. Even those claiming to be potential employers would have had access to an individual's immigration, welfare, and health records. In Toronto, assistance recipients can be seen as the test case for widespread use of fingerscanning in Canada--the beginning of a slippery slope. The Royal Bank's involvement in fingerscanning Metro welfare recipients is particularly problematic. If the plan is implemented, all 31 200 of Toronto assistance recipients who do not currently have bank accounts will be forced to access their benefits from an account set up for Social Services by the Royal Bank. The only way they will be able to do this will be through bank machines: The Royal Bank is not interested in investing the time and resources necessary to personally service these "clients". Instead, they have agreed to provide a training session in which these people will be shown how to use bank machines. However, unless this session 1) trains people not to have mental illness 2) dismantles the cultural barriers to using bank machines and 3) teaches people to read and write English or French, many of these 31 200 people and their families will have great difficulty accessing their assistance funds.
There is also a question of who will pay for Royal Bank user fees. Brett Fleming, a Bank executive involved in the negotiations, has stated that "we'll all have to bear some of the pain". They have kindly offered to forfeit the profits for at least two user charges per month. Fleming claims that Metro Social Services will likely cover 5 more Interac charges per month for each of these recipients.  At current rates, this would cost taxpayers $2 340 000 a year... Fortunately for Brett, it seems that the Royal Bank's "pain" will be Activists in the United States, are finding it difficult to eliminate the practice of fingerscanning, as it has quickly become entrenched in American public policy. In Canada, biometric identification is new enough that it can be challenged more easily. Legal and social justice groups are already mounting
campaigns to put an end to Metro's plans before the deal is finalized. A group based in Guelph has formed with the goal of forcing the Royal Bank to withdraw from the consortium, making it difficult for the program to proceed. The campaign's strategy is to use a boycott to draw negative attention to the Royal
Bank, forcing them to question whether they are willing to risk their reputation for the fingerscanning plan. The campaign is urging people across the province to withdraw their student loans, accounts, and RRSPs from the Bank.

METRO TORONTO AND THE FINGERSCANNING SCHEME:
SOME OF THE FACTS THEY AREN'T TELLING US
For the last few years some of the people from Metro social services have been
working with large corporations to develop a program for fingerscanning people
on welfare.  On June 19, 1996 Metro Toronto Council passed a decision recommending that this program be implemented as soon as possible, probably
starting at the beginning of 1997.  The program is complicated, and full of very serious problems that have not been discussed in the mainstream media.
Soooo... I've tried to use plain english to explain what's going on, and how fingerscanning will effect people on welfare, and society in general if it is implemented.  If parts of this "report" aren't clear, or if it is missing any important info please contact me (sarah) so I can revise it. (my number and email are listed at the end)   PART I:  	THE BASICS... WHAT IS IT AND HOW WOULD IT WORK?
What is biometric identification?
-the use of someone's body to identify them, whether it's by fingerscanning, retinal scans etc..
What happens to someone when they get fingerscanned?
-when you apply for welfare you would put a couple of your fingers into the scanning machine.  That machine takes your fingerprint pattern and converts into a unique set of numbers and letters, a "bioscrypt".  It's kind of like having your fingerprint turned into a bar code that is held in the computer's database. Who has access to the fingerscans?
The bar code is, at least according to the information I've been able to find,
accessible to anyone.  It is just stored in the computer, so that the computer won't accept your fingerprint (or bar code) if you try to apply for welfare again.  Metro council is recommending that the bar codes be destroyed three months after someone goes off of social assistance.  According to them, the only person who could access these numbers would be the person responsible for maintaining the system.  This person only accesses the system periodically to make sure that bioscrypts have been destroyed at the appropriate time.
How often will people on welfare have to be fingerscanned?
-although Metro officials say that people will only be fingerscanned when they register for welfare, Metro Committee documents imply that biometric id will be used more often than that...
Human Services Committee Report  pg.11, (A) improving customer identification says.."CIBS will address...ongoing confirmation of identity" (I underlined that)
"Biometric technologies give customers a fast, non-intrusive and very reliable
way to provide indisputable proof of identity - even if they have no other identification." but, since other id like a driver's licence etc.. will still have to be used for enrollment, the only way this statement can be true is if Metro is planning on fingerscanning people on welfare at other times as well.  ("CIBS" is what they're calling the program, it stands for "Client Identification and Benefit System")
Who is getting paid to develop this program?
-the Royal Bank, Great West Life Assurance, and Unisys Canada are heading the group (or "consortium") that has won this contract
What is the Royal Bank's role in fingerscanning?
-they are providing a Metro Social Services Royal Bank account that anyone on welfare who doesn't currently have a bank account will get their money from
What is Great West Life Assurance's role?
-they are developing a benefits card that welfare recipients will use at the dentist's etc.  instead of vouchers
What is Unisys' role?
-right now Unisys wants to provide the computer administrative backup for the program.  They also have biometric identification technology which they hope to sell to Metro social services.
Who is providing the biometric technology for this project?
-they haven't finalized which particular type of biometric id they will use yet (it will almost certainly be fingerscanning) once they do decide, THEN they
will start negotiating contracts with people that sell the technology...among these corporations are Unisys Canada and Mytec.
How would the system change the way people get access to their money?
-people who already have bank accounts will get their money direct deposited into their accounts (for many the way they access their money won't change)
-people who don't have bank accounts get Royal Bank cards that they'll take to Royal Bank machines to withdraw their money.  As of yet, there are no provisions for people to get their money any way other than by using a Royal Bank machine--they won't be allowed to go to tellers to take out their money.  No one is sure about what provisions will be made for bank user fees--i.e. Interac charges.
Where else is this happening?
-In several places across the US (eg. Los Angeles and Alameda Counties, in California, Ohio etc..)  -In Spain fingerscanning is being used on the unemployed
How soon is Metro Toronto hoping to implement it?
-They hope to finish their negotiations and start implementing fingerscanning as early as January of 1997.
Would fingerscanning be mandatory?
-no. at first it would only be coerced (see the section on risks of refusal, under part 7).  But Metro council recommended making it mandatory in the future.  Right now their lawyers are advising them that they will run into serious human rights battles if they try to make fingerscanning mandatory right away.
PART 2: 	SPEAKING THEIR LANGUAGE...THE MONEY ARGUMENT
How much fraud is there in the welfare system??
-between 0.5% and 3% of welfare cases are fraudulent (ie "double-dippers --meaning that they are receiving cheques from more than one office).  This figure has been confirmed by Liberal and NDP studies, it and includes administrative errors.
-one Metro councillor has stated that fraud is actually no more than 0.5%
-of the 10 000 calls received by Metro's fraud line, only 0.7% were confirmed as double-dippers (globe, June 20) most of the people that were reported weren't even on welfare
-when discussing the amount of fraud in the welfare system it is essential to ask why people on social assistance commit fraud.  This requires ackowledging that in 1993 (before the 21.6% cut to assistance cheques) maximum welfare payments were still well below Stats Canada's poverty line
How much of taxpayer's money will it cost to install the system?
-$4-8 million to install for Metro (globe and mail, june 20)
-the cost is of installation is still being negotiated
-as far as I know, no one involved in the planning of the project has released estimates of the cost of training social service workers to use the system, of changing the computer filing system, of maintaining the new system etc... but these costs are sure to be substantial
Will taxpayer's money be used to pay for the royal bank for user fees so that social assistance recipients can get bank accounts (even though that's not what
many of them want)?
 yep.
If people get bank accounts, won't they get service charges as well?
-"We'll all have to bear some of the pain", says Bank executive Brett Fleming. He claims that the Royal Bank will probably pay for at least two uses of Interac per month per recipient, and that social services will probably pay for 5 more.
So... if, as Brett Fleming estimates, Metro pays for recipients to get 5 free uses of Interac per month, how much will that cost?
-there are 104 000 social assistance cases in Metro, 30% of them don't presently have bank accounts and therefore will have pseudo accounts set up at the Royal. That means that 31 200 new accounts will be set up at the royal for welfare recipients. FOR ONE MONTH
  		31 200    accounts
 	       x $6.25    5 interac charges @ $1.25/each	
FOR ONE YEAR
            $2 340 000 per year in cost to taxpayers--> additional Bank profit
FOR FIVE YEARS
                         $2 340 000   /year
 $11 700 000 in five years in cost to taxpayers-->additional Bank profit***
***note: this calculation is made under the assumption that Interac charges will not increase in the next five years, and that welfare rolls will remain the same size
But can't these costs be avoided by encouraging assistance recipients to use Royal Bank branches rather than bank machines?
no.  Assistance recipients who are provided with pseudo Royal Bank accounts will not
be allowed to use bank branches, they will only be allowed to use bank machines.
What is vendor fraud and will the system help to decrease it?
-vendor fraud is fraud committed by professionals who provide government paid benefits to people on welfare (eg. dentists).  Although the Royal Bank has stated that the thrust of the whole program is to decrease vendor fraud little proof has been provided so far that this will actually happen.
-they argue that the paper vouchers that used to be used by welfare recipients to pay for dental repairs, for instance, can fairly easily be reproduced making
it easy for vendors to charge the government for more services than they actually provide.  These paper vouchers are to be replaced by electronic cards so that the problem of duplication will be eliminated.  It is possible that the benefit card could deter vendor fraud to some extent;  However vendor fraud can easily occur in other ways (eg. By overcharging for services, or by charging for services that aren't neccessary....  -Also, and most importantly, detering vendor fraud has nothing to do with biometrically identifying welfare recipients.  If Metro Toronto wishes to use the benefit card to deter fraud (although the merits of this system are dubious) this could more inexpensively be done, and more sensibly be done, with out being attached to biometrical identification of the poor.
Will fingerscanning save money in the longrun?
-This is questionable:  New Zealand instituted this system, but ended up abandoning it because its costs of implementation and maintenance far outweighed the amount saved from reduced fraud.
PART 3:  	STIGMATIZATION
-Metro argues that they aim to decrease stigmatization of welfare recipients by replacing cheques with bank cards, but at the same time they are thinking about using this system to start forcing poor people to use welfare benefit cards instead of cash for food, clothing, tuition and other basic needs.
How does this criminalize welfare recipients?
-some people argue that the only reason fingerscanning is seen as criminalizing
is because it is confused with fingerprinting.  It is true that fingerscanning
technology is quite different from actual fingerprinting, but this does not erase the common element shared by both techniques:  When a person is fingerprinted by the police it is because they are suspected of a crime, they are considered suspicious and are therefore scrutinized.  When a person is fingerscanned for welfare it is also because they are suspected of a crime.  The crime is fraud, and by virtue of being poor and dependant on state funds you are automatically considered suspicious and therefore scrutinized.
-by spending millions on this system the government is helping to perpetuate the myth that our economic problems are caused by the poor. PART 4: 	ISSUES OF ACCESS Will fingerscanning make it easier for people who don't have "proper" identification to register for benefits?
-NO.  Even though this argument is often put forward, you will still have to have exactly the same types of identification to apply for welfare.  Metro Human Services Committee report reads, "Conventional forms of identification (e.g. driver's licence, birth certificate) will continue to be required to establish initial eligibility for social assistance." (p.11, (A) Improving Customer Identification)
If welfare recipients are only allowed to withdraw money from bank machines, how will people who have mental illnesses; do not read english or french; or  have cultural or personal reasons for not using bank machines;  be able to get their money?
-the Royal Bank says that they will provide one training session in which people will be shown how to use bank machines.  However, unless this session 1) trains people not to have mental illness 2) dismantles the cultural barriers
to using bank machines and 3) teaches people to read and write english or french, many of the 31 200 people and their families who don't currently have bank accounts will not have access to their assistance funds.
PART 5:  	ISSUES OF CORPORATE AND GOVERNMENT CONTROL
How could the project bring more corporate control to the welfare system?
-The idea of bringing in corporate sponsorship is brought up again and again in Metro Committee documents...
pg.3, recommendation that "the Corporate Administration Committee approve the continued participation of Metro Corporate and Human Resources in the systems and financial development of C.I.B.S. and the further exploration of the feasibility of C.I.B.S. applications to other corporate initiatives"
the future of the welfare system???
pg.15, (B) (II)
"the delivery foundation established by CIBS will give the Division unprecedented flexibility in the administration of program benefits.  One advantage could be to use this flexibility to optimize customer purchasing power by obtaining credits for our customers from various suppliers - supermarket chains, drug chains, educational institutions, dental clinics, property management companies, clothing stores."
-This statement very strongly urges corporate sponsorship.   Right now program benefits like dental care only cover certain services (eg fillings), and are only available to certain cash amounts.  The insinuation is that any corporate benefit credits from grocery stores, clothing stores,etc. would be handled in the same way.  ie. you would only be able to spend a certain amount on food, clothing, education etc. You would only be able to buy certain items, you would only be able to live in certain places. It makes it possible for the government to do things like make it impossible for you to buy cigarettes and junk food with your food credit.  It makes it possible for governements of the future to control whether or not you are allowed to buy birth control and what typesof birth control you are allowed to buy.   Whatever companies sponsored the program would be the only ones that you could buy from, even if their prices are higher than other stores, even if they aren't located near your home, even if you have cultural/personal/political reasons for not wanting to shop at these large corporations. It means that poor people would no longer be entitled to basic freedoms of choice. And like with dental benefits now, the location, time and details of your purchases would be recorded. The kind of underwear you buy, what you buy at the grocery store, what type of drugs you purchase, would all be recorded by the government.  It opens the door for a frightening amount of government and corporate control and surveillance.
PART 6:	A SYSTEM DESIGNED FOR EXPANSION--
WELFARE RECIPIENTS AS GUINEA PIGS.
Could fingerscanning of welfare recipients expand beyond Metro Toronto in the -yes, Metro council recommended that they consider making it nationwide in the "By working with its private sector partners to build an integrated customer identification and disbursement system that meets the operational and business needs of a large income support program, Metro will gain valuable experience and expertise that can be applied to other jurisdictions." (pg.7 (II) )
-they are also talking about selling this program to other areas, pg.7, (II)
"There is also the potential for future revenues related to the sale of specific applications developed for Metro to other jurisdictions.  There is clear interest in the approach the Division is taking, and the results that will be achieved.
Could fingerscanning be used for other government programs?
-Metro Human Services Committee report ( explains that, "recently, the Provincial government has announced it is assessing the development of an identification card that could cover a range of programs....
C.I.B.S. employs technologies that will very likely be compatible, and can be incorporated, with prospective provincial applications." (p.7, comments and discussion Part I (c).  The report goes on to clearly explain that one of the reasons for developing biometric id for welfare recipients is because they want to be prepared for when the province starts using fingerscanning for other areas.
-Mytec, one of the companies competing to supply the biometric technology also hopes to apply it to (among other things) Canadian immigration and healthcare.
-The spread of biometric identification has worked similarly in the US...It's use on welfare recipients has gradually become more and more widespread.  The acceptance of its use for this purpose has made it possible for the country to move in the direction of  using biometric id for a wide variety of services.  In Febuary, Congress discussed a bill that called for fingerscanning every resident of the US over the age of 16 in order to develop a centralized database of information that would have been made available to a wide variety of government and corporate interests, including anyone who claims to be a potential employer.  Now that fingerscanning for government services has become
entrenched in the United States it is extremely difficult for people to fight against its use.  People on welfare in Toronto can be seen as the test case for widespread use of fingerscanning in Canada, the beginning of a slippery slope.
PART 7: FIGHTING BACK
Legal Battles
-Several groups in Toronto are confronting this issue as a human rights violation.  Their strategy is to use the courts in order to have fingerscanning struck down. What can people on welfare do to fight against this?
-Gather and publicize information about this issue (eg. through leafletting, press releases, demonstrations, stickering, civil disobedience, street theatre...) -Join the Toronto coalition being formed by the Toronto-based group "Low Income Families Together"
-Speak to one of the legal groups interested in pursuing fingerscanning as a human rights issue (contact Elinor Mahoney at Parkdale Legal Services, for -Refuse to be fingerscanned.  (So far you are legally entitled to do this, however there are risks involved that you may or may not be able to take).  Some of these risks are.... Getting your cheque later than otherwise,

What can anyone do if they're concerned about fingerscanning?
-Make funds and support available for people on welfare who choose not to be -Join the Toronto Coalition against fingerscanning being formed by Low Income Families Together

Subj:	Encrypted lists and ease of use
I'm considering sending someone off to work on a project, but wanted to
sanity-check the idea and see if someone already has something similar.
Recently I've been involved in a number of small (30 people or less)
mailing lists which occasionally use PGP for encrypted mail.
The hassle comes when one is encrypting a message to the list.  With
people coming and going, remembering who is on what list is impossible.
We're always having to go back and re-send to someone who was left off
of the encryption list.
What I propose to do is have a second list, list-encrypted at host, for
every list at host.  Any mail sent to the list simply goes out in plaintext.
List-encrypted is encrypted for everyone on list, then sent to the list
with appropriate additional headers.
To secure the mail as it travels from the sender to list-encrypted, we
want to establish a public key for list-encrypted.  All mail to the list
*must* travel with the public key or be rejected.  When mail arrives at
list-encrypted, a deamon will process it.  The daemon knows the secret
key for -encrypted, and has a list of who is on what list.  The daemon
strips the -encrypted address, encrypts the message for all on the list.
If there are other people on the To: or Cc: fields, the deamon will
encrypt for them as well.  If any of this fails, the message is sent to
as many as possible and notification failure goes back to the original
sender indicating who the failures were.  The daemon then forwards it
to the list real list.  It preserves the From: field, but changs `To:
list-encrypted' into simply `To: list.'

Panelists: Hank Barry, Pam Samuelson, Mark Stefik, Gio Wiederhold
Moderator: Barbara Simons, Chair, USACM
  o What is the role of copyright in all-electronic publication world?
  Will it be replaced by contract law?
  o Can the needs of authors who want to publish for renown (academics) and
  authors that want to publish for pay (entertainment etc) be handled in one
  mechanism?
  o Should browsing on the World Wide Web of full copyrighted texts be made
  illegal because people make temporary copies in their computer's memory
  when they look at a web page?
  o Should online service providers, including libraries and universities,
  have to monitor user accounts in order to enforce copyright laws?
  o Should firms that compile data have intellectual property rights so
  that scientists and news reporters can't use the data without permission
  or payments?
  o How should existing differences in national copyright be handled in a
  networked world where national boundaries and are little more than a
  speedbump on the information superhighway?
  o Does technological protection for copyrighted works inherently undermine
  fair use ?
These and related issues will confront the 105th Congress in the coming year.
They will also be examined by this panel, which will discuss controversies
surrounding the extension of copyright law to deal with cyberspace.
Examples include: How does proposed legislation reflect the net?
How much influence have lobbyists for the entertainment industry had
in writing legislation?  What should be the role of professional
societies in analyzing policy initiatives?
We will discussed legislation and international treaties that
have been proposed by the White House.  We will also examine both
technical and legal approaches to problems created by the net,
as well as how various approaches might impact the
science, technology, and business communities.
A significant amount of time will be allowed for audience
interaction in the discussion.

This list is for discussions of issues related to managing Internet
mailing lists, including (but not limited to) methods, mechanisms,
techniques, policies, and software (in general; questions about
specific software packages should be directed to the mailing list
dedicated to that particular package).
Technical questions regarding particular software packages (for
instance, Majordomo, LISTPROC, ListServ, etc.) are NOT appropriate
for the List-Managers mailing list.  They should be directed to the
mailing list dedicated to that particular package (for instance,
for Majordomo, that's Majordomo-Users at GreatCircle.COM).  Check the
documentation that came with the package to find out where the support
list for that package is hosted.
This list is an outgrowth of the "Mailing Lists" workshop session

restriction makes it much easier for me to track down mailer problems.
I'm very aggressive when it comes to bounced email.  If email to you
starts bouncing, I'll probably drop you from the list fairly quickly;
you'll have to resubscribe when you get the problem fixed, and retrieve
the archives to find out what you missed.

you should simply wait a few days before trying to deliver mail to that
address. If it's because the address isn't there any more, you should delete
it from the subscription lists. Otherwise, the instant people's mail quotas
overflow (e.g., they're on AOL and they haven't been able to get through the
clogged lines), they get bounced... or you're left with a lot of invalid

One of the most controversial aspects of cyberspace is censorship. A
widely accepted solution to eliminating the "unwanted" is self-imposed
censorship, through special software which blocks out types of content
not desired.
The appeal of these programs is that people needn't rely on distant
authority to dictate acceptability. We police ourselves; or at least we
have some control over how we will be policed.
The news media have generally blessed "blocking software" with
unexamined sprinklings of warm praise. After all, who dares suggest
that stopping your 5-year-old from seeing graphic gore, violence or sex
is bad? What could go wrong with that?
But, now critics are starting to ask, who is "watching the watchers?"
Could these watchers themselves develop more "creative applications"
for their power to silence? Could they apply their own personal
prejudices, or even their own hidden agendas?
Or is that paranoid nonsense?
Ask U.S. author Jonathan Wallace (jw at bway.net). Wallace says
California's Solid Oak software, which produces Cybersitter blocking
software, has added his site to its "block list" in retaliation for
critical remarks he made about the company.
Solid Oak claims 900,000 registered Cybersitter users.
Wallace, a New York-based software business executive and attorney is
co-author of the book _Sex, Laws and Cyberspace_ (Henry Holt, $34.95).
Net.column will discuss the book with its author next installment.
He's also editor of the monthly Webzine _The Ethical Spectacle_, which
focuses on "the intersection of ethics, law and politics in our
The Webzine recently asked readers to not purchase Cybersitter because
of continuing reports of Solid Oak's "unethical behavior."
"In the book," Wallace says in a press release explaining his current
attitude to Cybersitter, "we took the position -- naively, I now think

14th Street and Pennsylvania Ave., N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20230.
Docket No. 960918265-6366-03
Dear Ms. Crowe
        The United States Public Policy Committee for the Association for
Computing (USACM) welcomes this opportunity to submit our views on the
Interim Rule issued by the Department of Commerce with regard to
"Encryption Items Transferred From the United States Munitions List to the
Commerce Control List."  The USACM believes it is in the best interest of
the U.S. government to promote the widespread use of strong encryption.
needs and interests of academic, professional, scientific, and ordinary
users of telecommunications technology.  Thus, the Interim Rule must be
modified before it can resolve the many problems with the current export
controls on encryption technologies.
Introduction and Summary
        The Association for Computing is an international professional
society whose 76,000 members (60,000 in the U.S.) represent a critical
mass of computer scientists in education, industry, and government.  The
USACM provides a means for promoting dialogue on technology policy issues
with United States policy makers and the general public. We have
identified a number of serious problems with specific provisions of the
Interim Rule.
        As a professional society of computer scientists which produces a
number of peer-reviewed technical journals, we are concerned that the
Interim Rule will hamper both communication and education in our field.
Part 7.34.3 (b)(3) which refers to the distinction between printed and
electronic publications of cryptographic materials is unworkable under the
new paradigms of electronic publishing and communications. Electronic
media, including the World Wide Web, listserves, Usenet news groups, and
video conferencing are becoming the prominent means by which scientists
communicate.  Provisions of the Rule, specifically Parts 7.34.9 and 744.9,
which affect teaching cryptography to foreign students are vague and
contradictory.  Educational environments are not limited to academic
institutions but also occur in national and industry labs and by distance
education.  Restrictions on cryptography exports must not interfere with
the traditional freedom of access over digital networks which is
indispensable to maintain motivated and effective academic and research
        We also believe that the development of public policies and
technical standards for communications technologies, such as a Key
Recovery Infrastructure (KRI), raise vital issues of privacy,
competitiveness, and scientific innovation.  Parts 740.8 and 742.15 raise
a number of troubling issues for the computing community.  We believe it
is unwise for the Commerce Department to link relaxing export controls on
56-bit encryption to the development of a KRI as both the desirability and
the feasibility of such a system remains uncertain. Key recovery products
have not yet been subject to the vigorous testing necessary for a proposed
standard and there is little understanding of how such a system would
operate and what controls would be needed to ensure that it remained
secure.  Also, Supplement No. 7 to part 742 (which requires that
businesses who wish to export 56-bit encryption before 1998 submit a
biannual business plan for developing key recovery products) will stifle
the innovation of new cryptography technologies and discourage the process
of scientific innovation.  We believe the Commerce Department should not
promulgate regulations which prohibit U.S. research and development from
responding to market demands and limit the ability of Americans using new
on-line services to protect their privacy.
        The USACM has identified electronic publication, education,
research and development, key recovery, and privacy as problematic areas
which need addressing.  We have outlined our concerns below:
Electronic Publishing
        It is unreasonable and unconstitutional to distinguish between
printed and electronic distribution of encryption source code as set forth
in the note to Part 7.34.3 (b)(2) and (b)(3).  A Federal Court in
California has ruled in Bernstein v. U.S. Department of State that source
code is speech and is thus protected under the first amendment.  This
distinction is also currently being challenged in a federal court in the
District of Columbia in Karn v. U.S. Department of State.  The USACM
joined the Electronic Privacy Information Center, the American Civil
Liberties Union, and the Internet Society in submitting an Amici Curiae
brief in the case which argued that such language is an impermissible
regulation aimed at the suppression of expression. As computer scientists
we see no practical reason why the Commerce Department should insist on
creating a distinction when one does not exist.
        The ACM is the publisher of numerous scientific publications and
conference proceedings.  They range from our flagship journal
Communications of the ACM (CACM) to the on-line, peer-reviewed journal
Experimental Algorithms.  All 76,000 members of ACM, including 15,000
members overseas, receive CACM by mail and have access to ACM's on-line
publications. ACM foresees a time when all its publishing will be
electronic and on-line.  At that time, it will need interoperable
encryption technology available in the U.S. and in its mirror sites abroad
to dispense its material.  Its subscribers worldwide will need access to
secure, commercial encryption as well.
        An article which described the development of a new cryptographic
algorithm would likely appear in one of the many technical journals or
conference proceedings published by ACM or the Institute for Electronics
and Electrical Engineers (IEEE), another international professional
society.  In fact a number of the groundbreaking articles in the field of
cryptography science were originally published by ACM and IEEE.
Publication of encryption algorithms is extremely important to the field
of cryptography.  In order for an algorithm to be trusted, it must be
challenged.  To do that, the code must be made widely available.  Foreign
members of ACM will be unable to access in electronic format the same
articles they currently receive in the printed journal.  And, it is
technically impossible, at this late date, to partition ACM's publications
into distinct paper and electronic (hence encryptable) media.
        Electronic communications, including the World Wide Web, list
serves, Usenet news groups, and video conferencing are becoming the
prominent means by which scientists communicate.  Science is a global
pursuit and there exists a open communications network between scientists
in different countries.  Part 734.2 which prohibits making cryptographic
software available outside the U.S. will not only eliminate this
international communication but also technical communication among U.S.
scientists.  In electronic communications it is not always clear to whom
the information is being transmitted.  WWW sites and Usenet news groups
are accessible by anyone with a modem.  Video conferences can be
retransmitted overseas and moderated listserves are difficult to control.
The Interim Rule refers to an individual taking "precautions adequate to
prevent unauthorized transfer of such code outside the U.S."  It is our
belief that it would be impossible to be certain of any precautions taken.
This will effectively eliminate all communications on electronic media
that describe or discuss cryptographic source code.
        We believe the interim rule must be revised to eliminate the
distinction between printed and electronic source code and to allow for
open communications within scientific communities.  Restricting these
communications will retard the evolution of the science and the
development of new algorithms and cryptographic devices.
        Many ACM members are computer science professors and teachers, so
we are concerned about the contradictions in the proposed regulations with
regards to education.  A number of fields and sub-fields address
cryptography as part of their curricula.  Part 734.9 states that
"Educational Information" is not subject to the new regulations if it is
"released by instruction in catalog courses and associated teaching
laboratories of academic institutions." Computer science, mathematics,
engineering, and electronic security may all include technical instruction
in encryption technologies and would be covered in U.S. university
classrooms.  However, questions arise with regard to distance and home or
overseas education because of Part 744.9.  It states that "No U.S. person
may, without a license from BXA, provide technical assistance (including
training) to foreign persons with the intent to aid a foreign person in
the development or manufacture outside the United States..."  While Part
744.9 defines a U.S. person it does not define "technical assistance" or
"training."  It is uncertain whether a U.S. professor teaching a course in
which foreign students are registered, or teaching a course in
cryptography overseas would be "training" a foreigner to develop a
cryptographic device if the course work was more detailed than "a
discussion of information about cryptography."  This would affect course
studies as disparate as 'number theory' and 'local area networks'.
        Also, educational environments are not limited to academic
institutions but are also found in national and industry labs.  Many
computer scientists receive their first hands on training after they
graduate from their University.  It is unclear whether this "training" or
"technical assistance" is in violation of the Interim Rule.  The intent of
the training is give the new employee the practical tools necessary to
participate in the field of cryptography science, and is not necessarily
intended to be project or employer specific.  While the General
prohibition in Part 744.9 discusses the meaning of intent as applied to an
academic setting, it is not clear if "academic setting" can be applied to
instruction which occurs outside of the University environment.
        The argument made previously with regard to digital media also
applies to education. As part of their course work, students often use
electronic media as resources (WWW, digital libraries, CD-ROMs), as a
communication device for the class outside the classroom (electronic mail,
listserves), and to learn from listening to the discussions among research
scientists (Usenet groups, listserves).  Part 7.34.3 (b)(3) which covers
encryption source code in electronic form or media will restrict these
types of educational instruction.  Instructors will be unable to take
advantage of digital media in their courses.  Students studying
cryptography will be unfairly disadvantaged as they will be unable to
access valuable resources even in the process of furthering their
        The USACM believes the contradictions in Parts 7.34 and 744.9 must
be resolved in a clear manner so educators are not required to reduce the
quality of their courses for fear of misinterpreting the Interim Rule.
Specifically, "academic setting," "training," and "technical assistance"
must be defined, and distance education, and academic research and
communication must be addressed.
Research and Development
        Encryption policies must reflect the needs of the global market.
The international demand for products which incorporate strong
cryptographic tools is growing. Such products are widely available and
produced by a number of nations.  U.S. scientists have been prominent in
the development of current encryption technologies.  The field has
developed though research and development efforts along many different
tangents, only one of which describes key recovery products.  There is
little evidence that the demand for cryptography tools is limited to those
products which incorporate key recovery protocols. Part 742.15 (which
states that businesses must submit a business plan for the development of
key recovery products before they may export 56- bit software;  the
license must be renewed biannually until 1998 when only key recovery
products will be allowed for export)  will restrict the U.S. to producing
only products which incorporate KRI protocols.
        Mandating that businesses develop key recovery products will also
impede the natural market development of novel and innovative systems.
Part 740 hypothesizes that a worldwide KRI will be desirable, feasible,
and in place by 1998.  However it is unclear whether key recovery is the
best alternative.  Research along new tangents will continue in non-
industry and non-U.S. settings.  A new protocol may be discovered which is
considered a better choice for a worldwide infrastructure.  There will
exist a great market demand for variety in choosing a security system to
fit the needs of the distinct commercial group.  If this happens U.S.
scientists and industry will be at a disadvantage as they will have only a
core competence in key recovery protocols as per Part 740.8.
        There are a variety of commercial groups interested in utilizing
the Internet for business interactions and transactions. Without
interoperable encryption programs, commercial needs in an increasing
global environment cannot be met.  Supplement No. 4 to Part 742 states
that a product can not interact with another product whose key recovery
system has been "altered, bypassed, disabled, or otherwise rendered
inoperative."  This will be a major source of problems for researchers and
educators, as well as government and commercial institutions.  The result
of a system not being able to talk to another system because of an
intentional or accidental disabling of the KRI protocols can have a very
large impact on telemedicine, research, government operations, and
commercial enterprises.
        The USACM believes the Interim Rule should be rewritten to avoid
dissuading innovation and development and eliminating the U.S.'s core
competency in cryptography.  It should also recognize the need for
consistency in interoperable systems.
Key Recovery
        The USACM recognizes that there is a real market demand for key
recovery products from business and government employers.  However, the
viability of a KRI has not yet been determined.  It has not yet been
subject to the vigorous testing necessary for a proposed standard.  There
is little understanding of how such a system would operate and what
controls would be needed to ensure that it remained secure.  Part 740
describes the development of a Key Recovery Infrastructure within two
years.  We believe it is unwise for the United States to insist on the
development of a untested, unproved technology for a worldwide
infrastructure. The National Research Council report stated that a
feasibility study needed to be performed on a smaller scale before key
escrow could be seriously proposed for commercial applications.  We
believe this warning applies to KRI as well.  While key recovery tools may
be appropriate in some settings, we believe it would be wrong to impose
such restrictions on users or businesses and the Interim Rule should not
dictate that businesses limit their research to a potentially unworkable
       The USACM believes that certain principles should be reflected in a
national cryptography policy.  Encryption should be used for privacy
protection and to encourage the development of technologies and
institutional practices which will provide real privacy for the future
users of the NII and real security for the protection of the system. The
USACM believes that transferring the regulation of cryptography to the
Commerce Department could establish United States leadership in protecting
the privacy rights of its citizens.  However the Interim Rule fails to do
       We recognize that the government has a legitimate interest in
protecting national security. However, whether or not the worldwide
infrastructure is achieved, the role of national security agencies will
remain difficult.  The government's proposal to balance national security,
business, and privacy interests by creating a Key Recovery Infrastructure
within the next two years is overly aggressive.  We suggest that the
development of a policy that serves the long term interests of our
nation's security will not be one based on a Key Recovery Infrastructure,
but rather one that anticipates the widespread availability of strong
encryption and the multifaceted demands of a global economy.  Toward that
end, the interests in protecting open research within the U.S. academic
community will be crucial.

One of the most controversial aspects of cyberspace is censorship. A
widely accepted solution to eliminating the "unwanted" is self-imposed
censorship, through special software which blocks out types of content
not desired.
The appeal of these programs is that people needn't rely on distant
authority to dictate acceptability. We police ourselves; or at least we
have some control over how we will be policed.
The news media have generally blessed "blocking software" with
unexamined sprinklings of warm praise. After all, who dares suggest
that stopping your 5-year-old from seeing graphic gore, violence or sex
is bad? What could go wrong with that?
But, now critics are starting to ask, who is "watching the watchers?"
Could these watchers themselves develop more "creative applications"
for their power to silence? Could they apply their own personal
prejudices, or even their own hidden agendas?
Or is that paranoid nonsense?
Ask U.S. author Jonathan Wallace (jw at bway.net). Wallace says
California's Solid Oak software, which produces Cybersitter blocking
software, has added his site to its "block list" in retaliation for
critical remarks he made about the company.
Solid Oak claims 900,000 registered Cybersitter users.

Docket No. 960918265-6366-03
Dear Ms. Crowe
        The United States Public Policy Committee for the Association for
Computing (USACM) welcomes this opportunity to submit our views on the
Interim Rule issued by the Department of Commerce with regard to
"Encryption Items Transferred From the United States Munitions List to the
Commerce Control List."  The USACM believes it is in the best interest of
the U.S. government to promote the widespread use of strong encryption.
needs and interests of academic, professional, scientific, and ordinary
users of telecommunications technology.  Thus, the Interim Rule must be
modified before it can resolve the many problems with the current export
controls on encryption technologies.
Introduction and Summary
        The Association for Computing is an international professional
society whose 76,000 members (60,000 in the U.S.) represent a critical
mass of computer scientists in education, industry, and government.  The
USACM provides a means for promoting dialogue on technology policy issues
with United States policy makers and the general public. We have
identified a number of serious problems with specific provisions of the
Interim Rule.
        As a professional society of computer scientists which produces a
number of peer-reviewed technical journals, we are concerned that the
Interim Rule will hamper both communication and education in our field.
Part 7.34.3 (b)(3) which refers to the distinction between printed and
electronic publications of cryptographic materials is unworkable under the
new paradigms of electronic publishing and communications. Electronic
media, including the World Wide Web, listserves, Usenet news groups, and
video conferencing are becoming the prominent means by which scientists
communicate.  Provisions of the Rule, specifically Parts 7.34.9 and 744.9,
which affect teaching cryptography to foreign students are vague and
contradictory.  Educational environments are not limited to academic
institutions but also occur in national and industry labs and by distance
education.  Restrictions on cryptography exports must not interfere with
the traditional freedom of access over digital networks which is
indispensable to maintain motivated and effective academic and research
        We also believe that the development of public policies and
technical standards for communications technologies, such as a Key
Recovery Infrastructure (KRI), raise vital issues of privacy,
competitiveness, and scientific innovation.  Parts 740.8 and 742.15 raise
a number of troubling issues for the computing community.  We believe it
is unwise for the Commerce Department to link relaxing export controls on
56-bit encryption to the development of a KRI as both the desirability and
the feasibility of such a system remains uncertain. Key recovery products
have not yet been subject to the vigorous testing necessary for a proposed
standard and there is little understanding of how such a system would
operate and what controls would be needed to ensure that it remained
secure.  Also, Supplement No. 7 to part 742 (which requires that
businesses who wish to export 56-bit encryption before 1998 submit a
biannual business plan for developing key recovery products) will stifle
the innovation of new cryptography technologies and discourage the process
of scientific innovation.  We believe the Commerce Department should not
promulgate regulations which prohibit U.S. research and development from
responding to market demands and limit the ability of Americans using new
on-line services to protect their privacy.
        The USACM has identified electronic publication, education,
research and development, key recovery, and privacy as problematic areas
which need addressing.  We have outlined our concerns below:
Electronic Publishing
        It is unreasonable and unconstitutional to distinguish between
printed and electronic distribution of encryption source code as set forth
in the note to Part 7.34.3 (b)(2) and (b)(3).  A Federal Court in
California has ruled in Bernstein v. U.S. Department of State that source
code is speech and is thus protected under the first amendment.  This
distinction is also currently being challenged in a federal court in the
District of Columbia in Karn v. U.S. Department of State.  The USACM
joined the Electronic Privacy Information Center, the American Civil
Liberties Union, and the Internet Society in submitting an Amici Curiae
brief in the case which argued that such language is an impermissible
regulation aimed at the suppression of expression. As computer scientists
we see no practical reason why the Commerce Department should insist on
creating a distinction when one does not exist.
        The ACM is the publisher of numerous scientific publications and
conference proceedings.  They range from our flagship journal
Communications of the ACM (CACM) to the on-line, peer-reviewed journal
Experimental Algorithms.  All 76,000 members of ACM, including 15,000
members overseas, receive CACM by mail and have access to ACM's on-line
publications. ACM foresees a time when all its publishing will be
electronic and on-line.  At that time, it will need interoperable
encryption technology available in the U.S. and in its mirror sites abroad
to dispense its material.  Its subscribers worldwide will need access to
secure, commercial encryption as well.
        An article which described the development of a new cryptographic
algorithm would likely appear in one of the many technical journals or
conference proceedings published by ACM or the Institute for Electronics
and Electrical Engineers (IEEE), another international professional
society.  In fact a number of the groundbreaking articles in the field of
cryptography science were originally published by ACM and IEEE.
Publication of encryption algorithms is extremely important to the field
of cryptography.  In order for an algorithm to be trusted, it must be
challenged.  To do that, the code must be made widely available.  Foreign
members of ACM will be unable to access in electronic format the same
articles they currently receive in the printed journal.  And, it is
technically impossible, at this late date, to partition ACM's publications
into distinct paper and electronic (hence encryptable) media.
        Electronic communications, including the World Wide Web, list
serves, Usenet news groups, and video conferencing are becoming the
prominent means by which scientists communicate.  Science is a global
pursuit and there exists a open communications network between scientists
in different countries.  Part 734.2 which prohibits making cryptographic
software available outside the U.S. will not only eliminate this
international communication but also technical communication among U.S.
scientists.  In electronic communications it is not always clear to whom
the information is being transmitted.  WWW sites and Usenet news groups
are accessible by anyone with a modem.  Video conferences can be
retransmitted overseas and moderated listserves are difficult to control.
The Interim Rule refers to an individual taking "precautions adequate to
prevent unauthorized transfer of such code outside the U.S."  It is our
belief that it would be impossible to be certain of any precautions taken.
This will effectively eliminate all communications on electronic media
that describe or discuss cryptographic source code.
        We believe the interim rule must be revised to eliminate the
distinction between printed and electronic source code and to allow for
open communications within scientific communities.  Restricting these
communications will retard the evolution of the science and the
development of new algorithms and cryptographic devices.
        Many ACM members are computer science professors and teachers, so
we are concerned about the contradictions in the proposed regulations with
regards to education.  A number of fields and sub-fields address
cryptography as part of their curricula.  Part 734.9 states that
"Educational Information" is not subject to the new regulations if it is
"released by instruction in catalog courses and associated teaching
laboratories of academic institutions." Computer science, mathematics,
engineering, and electronic security may all include technical instruction
in encryption technologies and would be covered in U.S. university
classrooms.  However, questions arise with regard to distance and home or
overseas education because of Part 744.9.  It states that "No U.S. person
may, without a license from BXA, provide technical assistance (including
training) to foreign persons with the intent to aid a foreign person in
the development or manufacture outside the United States..."  While Part
744.9 defines a U.S. person it does not define "technical assistance" or
"training."  It is uncertain whether a U.S. professor teaching a course in
which foreign students are registered, or teaching a course in
cryptography overseas would be "training" a foreigner to develop a
cryptographic device if the course work was more detailed than "a
discussion of information about cryptography."  This would affect course
studies as disparate as 'number theory' and 'local area networks'.
        Also, educational environments are not limited to academic
institutions but are also found in national and industry labs.  Many
computer scientists receive their first hands on training after they
graduate from their University.  It is unclear whether this "training" or
"technical assistance" is in violation of the Interim Rule.  The intent of
the training is give the new employee the practical tools necessary to
participate in the field of cryptography science, and is not necessarily
intended to be project or employer specific.  While the General
prohibition in Part 744.9 discusses the meaning of intent as applied to an
academic setting, it is not clear if "academic setting" can be applied to
instruction which occurs outside of the University environment.
        The argument made previously with regard to digital media also
applies to education. As part of their course work, students often use
electronic media as resources (WWW, digital libraries, CD-ROMs), as a
communication device for the class outside the classroom (electronic mail,
listserves), and to learn from listening to the discussions among research
scientists (Usenet groups, listserves).  Part 7.34.3 (b)(3) which covers
encryption source code in electronic form or media will restrict these
types of educational instruction.  Instructors will be unable to take
advantage of digital media in their courses.  Students studying
cryptography will be unfairly disadvantaged as they will be unable to
access valuable resources even in the process of furthering their
        The USACM believes the contradictions in Parts 7.34 and 744.9 must
be resolved in a clear manner so educators are not required to reduce the
quality of their courses for fear of misinterpreting the Interim Rule.
Specifically, "academic setting," "training," and "technical assistance"
must be defined, and distance education, and academic research and
communication must be addressed.

        The ACM, founded in 1947, is an international non-profit
educational and scientific society dedicated to the development and use of
information technology, and to addressing the impact information
technology has on the world's major social challenges. The Association's
activities include the publication of scholarly journals and the
sponsorship of special interest groups (SIGS) in numerous disciplines. ACM
has 76,000 members.  The 60,000 who reside in the United States are
academic, professional, scientific, and ordinary users of
telecommunications technology and have a strong interest in the
development of sound encryption policies. The USACM provides a means for
promoting dialogue on technology policy issues with United States policy
makers and the general public. We respond to requests for information and
technical expertise from United States government agencies and
departments, seeks to influence relevant United States government policies
on behalf of the computing community and the public, and provides
information to the ACM on relevant United States government activities.

going to have to not forward to a gateway messages from other mailing

message arriving at the gateway if it can be helped; better to filter
it out beforehand), some of the mailing lists can forward and the
others cannot. (One could even determine this behavior on application
of the proper X-header, although I never trust various mailing systems
to forward such intact.) The same could also be done with gatewaying

What follows is a copy of the letter sent under the signature of AAAS' Executive Officer, Dr. Richard Nicholson, to the Department of Commerce on the Bureau of Export Administration's Interim Rule on the transfer of certain encryption items.  The letter expresses our concern that the current federal policy with regard to encryption raises serious questions for both scientific freedom and human rights work.  In addition, it marks the first time that the Association has weighed in on the crypto debate at this level.

Dear Ms. Crowe:
On behalf of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), the world's largest general scientific society, I am responding to the Bureau of Export Administration's Interim Rule on the transfer of certain encryption items, published in the Federal Register, December 30, 1996.  Before commenting directly on specific provisions of the Interim Rule, it is important to make the point that its basic thrust threatens to undermine essential features of scientific freedom and the open exchange of information that are generally acknowledged as critical to innovation in science and technology and are responsible in large part for the preeminence of America's research and development enterprise.  AAAS opposes attempts by the government to restrict the communication or publication of unclassified research and technical information, efforts which we believe are inconsistent with scientific advancement.  We are also concerned that certain provisions of the Interim Rule will adversely affect the effective use of information technologies in efforts to protect and promote human Many of our members in the academic community have legitimate concerns that teaching courses on cryptography appears to violate the Interim Rule if foreign students are enrolled in such courses.  Such a control seems to be inadvertent, since Part 744.9 states that "mere teaching or discussion of information about cryptography ... by itself would not establish the intent described in this section, even where foreign persons are present."  However, Parts 734.3(b) and 734.9 place controls on all "educational information" applying to encryption software controlled under ECCN 5D002, and "Educational information" is defined as "release by instruction in ... academic institutions."  This matter requires further clarification to avoid any unnecessary chilling effect on our educational process.
Currently, part 734.3 (b)(3) of the EAR posits a difference between the paper and electronic publication of the same cryptographic materials.  While it is acceptable under this provision to publish such material in a book and distribute it internationally without an export license, putting the same information on a disk and sending it abroad is subject to EAR approval.  This distinction has serious ramifications for scholarly communication as many professional journals are now moving onto the Internet as electronic publications.  Will cutting-edge innovations in cryptography be publishable in this new medium?  Consider the following example: the full text of Science magazine, the major peer reviewed journal published by AAAS, is currently available in both print and electronic formats.  According to the cited part in the EAR, an article accepted for publication on a new cryptographic algorithm would be acceptable in the print version of the publication.  However, because the electronic version is available to people outside the U.S., to comply with EAR, the journal would either have to be published without this article or substantial parts omitted.  Scientific publications are crucial to the advancement of science and technology and form a primary source of communication among researchers worldwide.  Restrictions that limit potential collaborations and channels of communication into new and innovative cryptographic products will not only impede scientific progress, but will also retard the evolution of a secure Global Information Infrastructure.
AAAS has encouraged the development of ethical standards by scientists to encourage responsible conduct and to establish accountability to a supportive public.  The codes of professional conduct promulgated by the largest and most important U.S. professional engineering and computing societies all stress the importance of protecting established cultural and ethical norms of information privacy and data integrity.  For example, the American Society of Information Science's Code of Ethics for Information Professionals mandates that its members "uphold each user's, provider's or employer's rights to privacy" and resist "all forms of censorship" in carrying out their responsibility "to improve, to the best of their means and abilities, the information systems in which they work or which they represent."  The Interim Rule would compel these scientists and engineers

What follows is a copy of the letter sent under the signature of AAAS' Executive Officer, Dr. Richard Nicholson, to the Department of Commerce on the Bureau of Export Administration's Interim Rule on the transfer of certain encryption items.  The letter expresses our concern that the current federal policy with regard to encryption raises serious questions for both scientific freedom and human rights work.  In addition, it marks the first time that the Association has weighed in on the crypto debate at this level.

Dear Ms. Crowe:
On behalf of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), the world's largest general scientific society, I am responding to the Bureau of Export Administration's Interim Rule on the transfer of certain encryption items, published in the Federal Register, December 30, 1996.  Before commenting directly on specific provisions of the Interim Rule, it is important to make the point that its basic thrust threatens to undermine essential features of scientific freedom and the open exchange of information that are generally acknowledged as critical to innovation in science and technology and are responsible in large part for the preeminence of America's research and development enterprise.  AAAS opposes attempts by the government to restrict the communication or publication of unclassified research and technical information, efforts which we believe are inconsistent with scientific advancement.  We are also concerned that certain provisions of the Interim Rule will adversely affect the effective use of information technologies in efforts to protect and promote human Many of our members in the academic community have legitimate concerns that teaching courses on cryptography appears to violate the Interim Rule if foreign students are enrolled in such courses.  Such a control seems to be inadvertent, since Part 744.9 states that "mere teaching or discussion of information about cryptography ... by itself would not establish the intent described in this section, even where foreign persons are present."  However, Parts 734.3(b) and 734.9 place controls on all "educational information" applying to encryption software controlled under ECCN 5D002, and "Educational information" is defined as "release by instruction in ... academic institutions."  This matter requires further clarification to avoid any unnecessary chilling effect on our educational process.
Currently, part 734.3 (b)(3) of the EAR posits a difference between the paper and electronic publication of the same cryptographic materials.  While it is acceptable under this provision to publish such material in a book and distribute it internationally without an export license, putting the same information on a disk and sending it abroad is subject to EAR approval.  This distinction has serious ramifications for scholarly communication as many professional journals are now moving onto the Internet as electronic publications.  Will cutting-edge innovations in cryptography be publishable in this new medium?  Consider the following example: the full text of Science magazine, the major peer reviewed journal published by AAAS, is currently available in both print and electronic formats.  According to the cited part in the EAR, an article accepted for publication on a new cryptographic algorithm would be acceptable in the print version of the publication.  However, because the electronic version is available to people outside the U.S., to comply with EAR, the journal would either have to be published without this article or substantial parts omitted.  Scientific publications are crucial to the advancement of science and technology and form a primary source of communication among researchers worldwide.  Restrictions that limit potential collaborations and channels of communication into new and innovative cryptographic products will not only impede scientific progress, but will also retard the evolution of a secure Global Information Infrastructure.
AAAS has encouraged the development of ethical standards by scientists to encourage responsible conduct and to establish accountability to a supportive public.  The codes of professional conduct promulgated by the largest and most important U.S. professional engineering and computing societies all stress the importance of protecting established cultural and ethical norms of information privacy and data integrity.  For example, the American Society of Information Science's Code of Ethics for Information Professionals mandates that its members "uphold each user's, provider's or employer's rights to privacy" and resist "all forms of censorship" in carrying out their responsibility "to improve, to the best of their means and abilities, the information systems in which they work or which they represent."  The Interim Rule would compel these scientists and engineers

on the entropy; no more than 7 bits (unless PGP's interface can
deal with control/etcetera keys) minus a fractional bit (for
characters like delete) per character. Of course, simply expanding
a passphrase of "a" to "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa" won't do you much good... but
most non-pathological passphrases will expand in entropy as they
expand in length. (There is the consideration, however, that a
lengthy passphrase may need to be in alphabetical characters,
as opposed to alphanumeric, due to human memory limitations. If
you didn't/don't have that, then even a completely random
over-19-character long passphrase (enough to be more than 128
effective bits going in) could be of assistance; greater length
makes it more likely that someone observing you will miss
enough of the passphrase to make a search impractical.)

"requirements" on past growth makes two assumptions, both of them invalid:
A. Past wiretaps (& other probes, such as pen registers & tap-and-trace) were
all entirely justified; the growth in their use does not reflect either
use of them in situations they are not required for or use of them in
situations in which government has essentially failed and more resources
poured into the alleged "problems" (e.g., drug trafficing, money laundering,
and pornography) will do less than no good whatsoever.
B. The number of lines will go up at the same rate as the estimated growth
in wiretaps. In regards to this latter one, if they go up at a greater rate,
then the FBI will request expanded capacity; if they go up at a lower rate,
they will assuredly not request a decrease, and will thus ultimately have
the capablility to wiretap _all_ lines.

types will be busily still protesting it, but without so many parents who
(falsely) believe their children will be harmed by exposure to sex, thus
dividing their efforts. Normally one would think that advertisers et al might
give in to a small number... but advertisers particularly suceptible to this
won't be sponsoring anything but G-rated shows anyway. (Of course, I view
the V-chip itself as a bad thing, but if it has an outcome opposite in at
least _some_ ways to the one intended by the neo-puritans, I can see the
silver lining.)
social pressure against spamming et al appears to be ineffective. The herd-like
public (referring to the parents with their foolish fears and anyone else
brainwashed into believing the puritans/fundamentalists) can put pressure on
with their buying patterns... as yet such a market system is lacking in mailing
lists (except for putting people on filter lists, which probably exacerbates
the problem). In other words, there is no particular reason for the spammers et
al to desist even if people _are_ receiving their email.

@_subject: Pro-CODE Bill 
(helpfully provided in a more accessible location
by jya), I do have some concerns over whether it
allows for anonymous remailer export - it has a
provision stating
Nothing in this Act may be construed to affect any law intended to prevent the-
(2) illegal or unauthorized distribution or release of classified, confidential, or
(3) enforcement of Federal or State criminal law.
Which causes some question in my mind whether it
would cover laws against or discouraging anonymous
remailers. (While the Supreme Court would probably
find outlawing anonymous remailers to be unconstitutional,
laws discouraging their export or other lesser forms of
harrassment might still pass muster, unfortunately.)

The following provision also causes me some doubts about
exactly what will be allowed for export:
(B) Exception.--The Secretary shall prohibit the
        export or reexport of particular
        software and computer hardware described in
        this subsection to an identified individual or
(iv) intentionally used to evade
which could be construed to cover anonymous remailers,
fully anonymous digital cash, anything set up to verify
gambling fairness, and various other things of interest
to Cypherpunks (including the use of PGP by, say, a drug
"kingpin"). Admittedly, the "identified individual
or organization in a specific foreign country" will
help in limiting this application.

@_subject: The Pro-CODE Bill could make things worse! 
Umm... non-encrypting remailers aren't much use. While something could
be worked out (as for most current Type 1 remailers) allowing hooking in
PGP or whatever, I would wonder whether that would make the remailer
program itself have "encryption capabilities" - a la the "crypto hooks"
restrictions in current export regulations. This would be even more of
a problem for remailers using socket links and DH superencryption to
prevent remailer operators from being pressured to decrypt intercepted
These prohibitions would also prohibit or at least restrict export of
technologies such as decense and the anonymizer in versions (as is
preferable) using encryption, except _possibly_ (see above) those
hooking in encryption from outside. Circumstances in which such
could be used to defeat US laws include a decense server being used to
prevent the tracing of an in-US pornographic site, if (heaven forbid)
the CDA (or a lesser version, such as one requiring labeling or going
by a "harmful to minors" standard) is found constitutional.
It is rather reminiscent, yes. If, for instance, all it requires is a check
on whether the domain name indicates the _certainty_ of being from such a
country, then it won't be extremely onerous... but I'm certain that the
government will try to interpret it in the most restrictive way possible.
