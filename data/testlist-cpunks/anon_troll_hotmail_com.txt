@_subject: Been tried before? 
I had an idea for a key system using graphics files. Has that been tried before? The basic idea was to use a graphics file with a color depth of 24-bit or higher. Then, using the rgb values of, say, every prime pixel (i.e. the first pixel, then the second....then the seventh, then the eleventh) or something like that to create a stream of numbers the feed into the cipher which would be highly erratic. A similar looking picture would not work, as the rgb values would be (I assume) hard to guess, and even if you came close, you would have to get the right order. If you used a graphics file format similar to PNG, for instance, you could even include alpha channels.
    Am I just shooting my mouth off, or does this sound like something that would work? I'm wondering if this has been tried before and if it would be worth programming out.
