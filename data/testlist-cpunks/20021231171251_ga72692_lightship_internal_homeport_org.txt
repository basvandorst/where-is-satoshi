Interesting point on grocery cards... Why do they have your name at all?  Every grocery card I've ever gotten they've said "here's your card and application, please fill out the application and mail it in".  I say "thank you ma'am", walk out the door and toss the "application" in the trash.  Not exactly strong (or any) name
