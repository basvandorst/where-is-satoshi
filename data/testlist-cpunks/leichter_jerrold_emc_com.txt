This is incorrect.  The law draws a distinction between recognized sellers of the good in question, and other sellers.  If you buy a washer from a guy who comes up to you and offers you a great deal on something from the back
of his truck, and it turns out to be stolen, you lose.  If you go to an
appliance store and buy a washer that turned out to be stolen, it's yours.  Buy a gold
ring from the salesman at the same store, and you better hope he didn't
steal As in any real-world situation, there are fuzzy areas at the edges; and
there are exceptions.  (Some more expensive objects transfer by title - mainly houses and cars.  You don't get any claim on the object unless you have a state-issued title.)  But the general intent is clear and reasonable.
This is no different from the case with cash today.  If there is a way to prove - in the legal sense, not some abstract mathematical sense - that a transfer took place, the legal system may reverse it.  This comes up in contexts like improper transfers of assets before a bankruptcy declaration,
or when people try to hide money during a divorce.

eTelemetry Locate                                      [Image]
      Locate dynamically discovers, correlates and archives the
      person behind the IP address--"the people layer"--to expedite
      forensic investigations and help comply with SOX. It
      approaches the issue of how to match a name to a network
      device from the identity side, a change from 802.1x and NAC
      methodologies.
      The Locate appliance sits passively on the network and
      analyzes packets in real time to garner ID info from sources
      like Active Directory, IM and e-mail traffic, then associates
      this data with network information.
      Once Locate is populated, IT can disconnect an individual with
      one click at the switch port level, a powerful tool for
      enforcing policy and halting the spread of infections. You
      also can connect to an end user's computer without asking for
      an IP address, track assets dynamically, stay in sync with
      Active Directory and other LDAP directories automatically, and
      archive network activity for forensic investigations.

Flylogic Engineering does some very interesting tampering with "tamper-
resistant" parts.  Most of those "secure USB sticks" you see around won't
last more than a couple of minutes with these guys.

@_subject: "Securing the Network against Web-based Proxies" 
Ah, where the web is going.  8e6 Technologies sells a hardware box
that it claims does signature analysis to detect HTTP proxies and
blocks them.  It can also block HTTPS proxies "that do not have a
valid certificate" (whatever that means), as well as do such things
as block IM, force Google and Yahoo searches to be done in Safe
mode, and so on.
They're marketing this to the education community (with the typical
horror stories of the problems your school district can run into
if students use proxies to get around your rules).
What I find most interesting, though, is that the company, based
in California, has an overseas presence in exactly two other
countries:  Taiwan and China.  One doesn't need much imagination
to see what market they are going after there....
