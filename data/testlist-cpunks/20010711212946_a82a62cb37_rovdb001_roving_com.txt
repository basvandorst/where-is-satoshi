Cold Fusion 4.0.  Unfortunately, the developer is no
longer around.
I need to know how to code the index.cfm pages, so that
the long path name does not display in the browser's
address box.  I often have links from advertisers to
this site that are long and ugly.
Ex: mydomain.com/sale/brand/index.cfm?source=goto
Can you help?  Any and all information will be greatly
