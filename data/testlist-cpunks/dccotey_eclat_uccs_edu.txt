@_subject: "Hackers"-- brief review and anecdote... 
(much like netscape's) has helped hackers far more than lack of encryption.  Imagine for a moment if sun had included some form of encryption (maybe in nfs ?) in sunos 4.x.x,  would it have been effective if it had as many holes as sendmail, etc.. ?
slopply coded will simply provide hackers with one more toy to abuse, while giving average people a false since of security (but you SAID it was strong crypto, so why did they get my credit card number ?)
