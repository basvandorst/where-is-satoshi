you apparently didn't read the stuff preceeding the log.  Those comments (with the (6)'s in front) are only heard by others in your row.  Its all organized like an auditorium.  Denning and Barlow didn't see any of that going on.

Doh!  Beat me by a few days!  Well...there'll soon be another.  Thought I was the only one who'd noticed the lack of a Windows client.  Ahhh well..
I'll keep you all posted.
