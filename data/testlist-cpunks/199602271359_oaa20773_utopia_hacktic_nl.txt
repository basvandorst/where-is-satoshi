@_subject: Perl T-shirt makes the big time 
Spotted in an NSA contractor's office: a column from InfoWeek or some such rag about the RSA-Perl T-shirt. Said column hijacked May's idea that shirting was trivial and turned it on ear-- ITAR is routinely being violated and no one cares.
NSA-heads said they got article by fax from the Death Star in Ft. Meade. Wonder how many black-clad Perl-toters there are on the reservation.
