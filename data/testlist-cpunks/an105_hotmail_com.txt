Hi, after adjusting claims for several insurance companies, I
found one thing the same.  No one seems to know much about what they are
entitled to.  So I decided to help the public towards even footing with insurance adjusters.                 I have been a crusader for policyholder's rights for a good many
years since and received acclaim from state departments' of insurance and state Governors for my work, albeit obscure.  Anyway, you may want

                                                       Best wishes,
                                                       Tony Braga
