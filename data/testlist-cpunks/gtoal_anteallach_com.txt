Tony Robinson (who some of you might know already) - the author of the
lossless 'shorten' sound compression program - is working on an ADPCM
version.  Currently compresses at 3 bits per (8 bit) sample.  This plus
a sampling rate of 4000hz instead of 8000hz (keeping it easy, on a sun)
just squeezes in under the bandwidth limitation of v32bis, with a little
left over for protocol overhead.
PS Has the 'netphone' list died or did I just drop off when I moved house
like I lost my cypherpunks subscription?  I remember there was talk of
letting it drop because the situation seemed to be in control, but I haven't
seen much progress since on vat et al, and the underground effort to do
something on soundblasters that everyone said 'shut up about' has had more
than enough time to come up with the goods...

Thanks for that explanation, that bit hadn't sunk in with me!
This makes me think... something similar would be a good extension to
SMTP wouldn't it?  DH exchange of keys before sending point to point
mail?  With the user's public keys being picked up via their .mailrc
or .pgpkey or something...
(It would only happen if both SMTP's supported it and both users had
made their public key available to the mail system)
I'm thinking of ways of automatically and easily encoding all traffic
by default, to avoid line snooping.  I'm not suggesting this as an
alternative to explicitly encrypting things you want to keep private.
You could still do that too.

That was smoke and mirrors by people who understand chaos better than
they understand encryption.  All it boils down to is a synchronised
pair of (not very good) PRNGs.  It's not a substitute for a one-time
pad by a long chalk, which is how they seem to be using it.  Basically
they've just reinvented every schoolboy's exor encryption program all
over again, this time with the latest 'chaos' buzzword thrown in to make
it sound hip.

*All* connections to any port can be logged.  And if your site isn't entirely
under your own control, your site can collude with the called site using
the ident protocol to tell the other site the name of the user that the
tcp/ip connection belongs to.  If the other end has a smart SMTP, it
can put this info in the received: headers.
I do stuff like this myself using the LOG_TCP wrappers.

It exists.  It's called 'nevot'.
The improved faster compression algorithm is also on the way very shortly
(the one by ajr that I mentioned the other day); with 4000byte/sec samples
and 8:3 compression, it fits in 14.4kb with enough to spare for packet

NEVOT - A network voice terminal (BETA RELEASE 1.3 03/25/93)
(c) Henning Schulzrinne
NOTE: The .nevotinit files from versions prior to 1.3 are incompatible
with the current command language and should be deleted.
The network voice terminal (NEVOT) allows audio-capable workstations to
participate in audio conferences across local and wide area networks.
- real-time protocols:
  - NVP (network voice protocol), as used by 'vat' (LBL) and VT (isi)
  - 'vat' native packet format and session protocol
  - RTP draft - versions for:
  - Sun SPARCstation (SunOS 4.1.x and Solaris 5.x)
  - SGI Indigo (4D Series) and
  - Personal DECstations [as soon as we can get the DEC audio library to work]
- GUIs:
  - XView
  - Tk [in progress]
  - curses
  - dumb terminal
- fully controllable by Tcl-based command language
- can serve as gateway for protocol and encoding translation
- network transport protocols:
  - TCP
  - unicast/multicast UDP   - ST-II [currently inoperative]
- several independent concurrent conferences, each with different
  encoding and compression
- DES-based voice encryption (U.S. only)
- audio encodings:
  - 64 kb/s (mu-law PCM)
  - 32 kb/s G.721 ADPCM (Sun only)
  - 32 kb/s Intel DVI
  - 24 kb/s G.723 APDCM (Sun only)
  - 13 kb/s GSM
  - 4.8 kb/s LPC codec
- each site can use different audio encodings
- playback and recording of AIFC and .snd audio files
- extensive statistics and tracing facilities
- arbitrary voice packet length, which may differ for each site
- lost packet and silence substitution
- setable audio buffer occupancy
- configurable adjustment mechanisms for playout delay, VU meter,
  silence detector and automatic gain control
- redefinable session identifier string with variable substitution
A compressed PostScript file describing Nevot is available for anonymous
ftp from gaia.cs.umass.edu, as file ~ftp/pub/nevot.ps.Z.
The sources are available by anonymous ftp from gaia.cs.umass.edu, as
file ~ftp/pub/nevot/nevot.tar.Z (compressed tar file).  The platform-
specific external libraries are contained in the directory
pub/nevot/lib.$ARCH. These typically change rarely.  ARCH can be either
dec, sgi, or sun4.
Precompiled binaries are available as well:
  nevot/bin.$ARCH/nevot.tar.Z
For the precompiled binaries, you also need to retrieve the initialization file ~ftp/pub/nevot/nevotinit and rename it to .nevotinit
in the directory from which you plan to start Nevot.
Unpack the compressed tar files, then execute the shell script
  compile
You may have to adjust parameters within the shell script to your
local needs, e.g., the compiler name.  You also have to install the
tcl library (version 6.7 or later), either the binary version as
mentioned above, or from sources to be found in
sprite.berkeley.edu:tcl.  In order to use the UDP multicast and/or
ST-II facilities, you have to install the appropriate kernel
Due to export restrictions, the DES encryption code is available only by
e-mail from the author. If you do have the DES code, change the value of
the symbol DES in the Makefiles to 1.
To enable on-line help for the OpenWindows version, the environment
variable HELPPATH should be set to include the source directory where
the .info files are located (here, assumed to be
   setenv HELPPATH ${HELPPATH}:/usr/local/nevot/xview
OPERATION WITH SD:
sd is a session directory written by Van Jacobson, LBL, available for
anonymous ftp at ftp.ee.lbl.gov.
The nevot/sd directory contains a replacement for the sd start_audio
procedure, which you can insert into your ~/.sd.tcl startup file. Make
sure that the directory containing the Nevot binary is in your path.
Use at your own risk (i.e., don't blame VJ if it doesn't work...).
If you experience difficulties, check the problems.tex file in the
doc directory.

@_subject: building a sound sampler for cryptophone application... 
My old uncle - a retired electrical engineer - has gone back to
night classes to learn electronics.  His class has to do little
projects that they pick themselves; nothing too advanced yet -
his last one was a musical door-chime...
Anyway, he was asking me for ideas for projects to build, and believe
me I've got dozens :-)  The one that I think is of most value to most
people, if he designs a simple circuit for it that I can publish,
is a cheap sound sampling interface .... which we can happen to
steal for our various cryptophone projects...
Here's how I see the design:  it feeds data into a (probably IBM PC)
parallel port (has to be the bidirectional kind, a plain printer port
clearly won't work), and *it* supplies the timing, ie the PC reads from
the port when the flags say data is ready, and no more data will be
presented to that port until n uSecs later - I foresee it supplying
data at either 8000 bytes/sec or 4000 bytes/sec if the former is too
fast for a PC to handle.
Putting the timing in the sampler frees the PC from a horrendous overhead
in sampling at accurate times, and would make it trivial to feed the
4000Hz samples into code like 'shorten' which would then be shoved down
a v32bis modem quite comfortably.  At a cost *much* less than any
commercial sampler: this thing is built from: a battery; a box; a DAC;
a 7$ microphone; a parallel port driver; a crystal, and a counter.
And that's it.  Dead cheap and easy to build, I hope.
What I'm writing here to ask is where can I get info on what chip to
use to feed data into a PC down the bidirectional parallel port, and
how do you drive the chip and what are the pinouts etc.  I don't expect
anyone to mail me detailed schematics or anything like that, just a
pointer to where to look for them.  (Though if someone *did* have data
sheets, I wouldn't say no to a quick fax :-) )
(fwiw, I used to do electronics as a hobby *years* ago - I once
built a dual-processor micro with dynamic ram, so don't be shy of
mailing me anything grossly technical; I've forgotten most of what
I knew in detail, but I remember enough to steer my uncle in the right
direction, though I won't be doing the actual circuit design myself)
Thanks for your time.  I hope this isn't considered too off-topic... (I
mean, I *could* have posted an incredibly interesting piece about the
Challenger disater instead, eh Eric? ;-))
PS Pointers to suitable usenet groups equally appreciated...

Yes, but have you ever tried to drive them from a C program?  From the
scanty docs I got with my Soundblaster, I wouldn't know where to start.
And I get the impression that there's a major cpu overhead with these
cards, like you can't actually do anything useful apart from grab the
data.  I want the data input to be free so there's CPU left over for
compression and encryption and network or modem driving, without having
to use a 66MHz 486 to do it...
Oh, and multimedia cards are pretty expensive.  This will cost maybe $25
at most.  It's the sort of thing that once designed, hardware-inclined
cypherpunks could hack up dozens of at home and pass them on at conventions like HoHoCon or the one we just had in the Netherlands...

*My* effort already is being better expended elsewhere.  As I said, my
old uncle has time on his hands and wanted suggestions; I thought it was
better not to squander such an opportune resource on junk like chiming
doorbells when he could be doing something for us just as easily.
Now, if anyone actually has an answer to the question, which was about
how to drive a PC parallel port for input, do let me know please.

I'm doing this for unix this weekend.  One very important point to
note:  only take *one* bit of random data per keystroke, and take
it by ex-oring every single bit in the clock() value - that way you
make sure the randomly fluctuating one is in there - because on
some systems the bottom bit might always be 0, if the resolution
of the clock is low.  Also, think about the problems if you have
a function that returns milliseconds but the hardware clock is one
tick, say, every 1/17 sec...

Hi folks - this cypherpunk has been writing code... all damn weekend (I'm
really feeling old - 24hr hacks used to be no problem.  Now i have to
stop for 5 hours sleep...)
Anyway, I've written a completely new - no pgp or RSA code - key server
which I can't see anyone being able to object to.
I'm looking for volunteers to alpha-test it.  Note, alpha-testing means
you have to know what you're doing - it's not in any way tested already
and you'll be helping find the bugs and smooth the installation process.
Mail me at gtoal at an-teallach.com if you want to volunteer as a tester
for a week.
This server works as a slave server hanging off the European ones; it'll
be fast at returning keys that it knows about, that have been around
for some time; all other operations may be a little slower.
The nice thing about it is that - inspired by the cypherpunk remailers - I've written it so that it can run on ordinary users accounts.  I think
it will be quite hard to get rid of this time :)
Just one thing - it needs the 'procmail' suite.  If you have it, fine, you'll
make a great tester; if you don't, please fetch it and get it running before
you approach me for the keyserver code.
In a week's time - ought to be enough for testing and fixing (I mean, it
only took two days to write the damn thing in the first place) - I'll
be releasing the code and hopefully making an announcement of all the
new keyservers that will exist.  (That last bit is up to you guys...)

First of all, I wrote the new replacement keyserver and I happen
to know it isn't even released yet (except to a handful of people
for the purposes of testing portability and ease of installation etc),
so it is not *possible* that the new sites have been harassed, and I
think you should wait until it happens before you start worrying about
it.  As I've said before, all these keyservers will be doing is
*publishing* information, and that's a protected right in the US.
Now, if pkp choose to start chasing down people who publish their
keys and asking them if they have a license (assuming they're in
the US and need one), that's a different thing altogether, but that could happen at the moment given that the actual keys are
up for ftp all over already.  A keyserver that doesn't patent (or
copyright?  Who told you that?) infringe *cannot* be closed down
even if the people whose keys are published *are* harassed.
Anyway, the keyservers have to exist for the benefit of both ViaCrypt

If one were slightly paranoid in the Detweiler mould, one might look
more closely at an41418's postings and the postings of the above, for
other similarities.  For instance, only Tim May and Jamie Dinkelacker
have ever used the word "essay"... (one I chose to look up at random);
or one could watch for idiosyncracies such as a misspelling like
'revokation' (Richard Kennaway alone, consistently), or "somesuch"
(Tim May, consistently) which they're probably not aware of and would
be hard pushed to suppress if they were adopting other personae.
Other things to look at are punctuation - do they consistently put
a comma before the last element of a list preceding an 'and', or do
they miss it out (as in the old style).  Things like that are a lot
harder to consciously suppress than using...ellipses for instance---instead
of dashes, in an attempt to disguise your most obvious writing traits.
Just FYI, I don't think any of the people mentioned here are each other,
unless they do a much better job of hiding their identities than I have
a right to expect - for instance Jamie Linkelackers appalling solecisms
- "thou doth protesteth too much" and "is purposive to" seem too archetypal
to me to be deliberate mistakes, and none of the other posters come close
to that kind of mistake.

Well, I did for one.  Some of you may remember me posting to sci.crypt
quite some time ago, because the one thing I wasn't happy about was the
use of a probabilistic primality tester when there were completely
certain primality tests available (albeit a bit more expensive in cpu).
(especially since I didn't understand how the probabilistic one worked)
I see from a posting on sci.crypt today that the probabilistic tests
have been show to be possibly mildly weak in some infrequent cases.
Probably not worth worrying about, but still, it's a sobering thought.
The rest of the code I understood well enough to trust it, mostly :)

I can tell why the arm was chosen: it comes as a drop-in circuit that

Read 'The straight dope' on how these questions are scored.  Anyone who doesn't believe in God, for example, comes off very badly.  There are
many very nasty assumptions all through it that reflect the prejudices

Close but your wording is misleading.  People compiling lists in this country do *not* notify the people on the lists.  The latter have to
know who is compiling data on them, then put in a request (like a FOIA
request) asking to be told what that data is.  The public register just
says 'company X keeps data' - it doesn't say on whom.  In order to find
out who is holding data on you, you would have to request it off every
company registered with the DPA - and at about 10 pounds per request,
that's a good way to go broke fast.
The Data Protection Act would be better renamed the Data Secrecy Act -
it primarily protects the large list of exempt bodies who not only
do not register but are also immune from seaches; and any searches by
other means are illegal.  For instance, town councils, the police,
banks, ... - just about anyone you would actually want to find out what
they have on you.

This may well be true; it's been posited that anyone with a usenet feed
should be registered since people post personal details in .sigs, and
the data can be searched automatically in the mail spool.  No-one to my
knowlege has done so though, and no-one is asking them to.  It's a big
bone of contention at the moment whether BBSes should register - some
see it as a way of squeezing them out of the BBS game.  Again, most
of them don't, and no-one complains.  However it's always at the back
of peoples' minds that the DPA could be used against them as an excuse
if they were ever targeted for other reasons (such as unpopular political

I can tell a fascinating tale about spoofed identities that happened

There is absolutely nothing wrong with a local redistribution of a
mailing list.  It probably isn't bidirectional, but even if it is,
so what?  What you're really saying is you don't want too many people
reading who you can't keep tabs on, isn't it?  Or are you really just
rankled that *Sternlight* can read cypherpunks and you won't know
about it?  I guess that must be it because we've *lots* of local
redistributions signed up for this list. (Anyone who wants to see
the complete direct membership list merely has to telnet to toad.com's
smtp port and EXPN the real list name)
I have a great deal of sympathy about 'private space', but if you want
to make this list in some way semi-private, then you *must* issue a
policy notice when anyone signs on the list, saying what the conditions
are, eg that it is not to be quoted in other forums or reposted to
local lists etc.  Otherwise people (unethical people, I mean) can do
what they like with our posts whether we approve or not.  I could show
you some of the warnings I've seen elsewhere, except I'd be in breach
of those lists rules by reposting them :)  [no, really, I just don't
have one handy...]
In fact, the truly paranoid would make list membership a two-stage
process where you first sent out the rules, then waited for a mail
accepting them...
I *don't* advicate this course by the way.  I'm happy with things
as they are, until DS turns up :-)

 Unfortunately, your netcom account also won't change when you change
 internet vendors.  What everyone should have is their own domain name;
 netcom offers this service (a la david at sternlight.com) for, I think,
 $45/month.
 Anyone who's interested in a better deal might like to check out
 internet.com who offer your own domain (and a single user id) for
 $75/year.  You get your mail rewritten by them to your ordinary
 account elsewhere (eg tcmay at netcom.com) and can move the domain with
 you should you ever be dissatisfied with internet.com's service.
 Apologies, btw, for not talking about code, but I guess if Perry

 This *is* a cypherpunks related goal IMHO, because everyone having
 their own site at home rather than just using their PCs as terminals
 to systems like netcom means they can *much* more easily integrate
 pgp into their routine mailing life.  (Uploading and downloading
 pgp mail is such a hassle for some people - like prz himself - that
 they just don't do it...)

I think the best you can do is to create a secure chroot subshell which
anyone logging in anywhere but from the console gets put into.
[When I wrote such a shell as an experiment, I found it very difficult
to do properly when the system had multiple partitions - I could only
get it to work on a machine that had a single pack.  So if you're starting
from scratch, my suggestion is to use netbsd and start off with your
entire disk on a single partition - don't have the traditional small
root partition.  If you get that far I have some code I can mail you.]

 The intent of 'Cypherpunks write code' is that Perry can dump on
 people talking about anything other than code ;-)  (When we *do* talk
 about practical stuff he tells us its impractical or been done
 before or pointless, or that we should stop *talk*ing about it
 and go away and do it...)  I'm surprised we bother running a list
 at all actually.  We should all be locked away in our garrets
 hacking I guess.
 (What I'm really saying is that this list clearly serves a purpose,
 and it is evolving into its own character, whatever that may be, despite
 the efforts of the early founder members to keep it on some tightly
 defined track that they once conceived it as.  I don't see this
 evolution as being a problem, and I'm slightly (though not to
 Detweilerian proportions) annoyed whenever people like Tim or Perry
 pull rank and try to limit the topics of discussion, when on closer
 inspection they're just as bad as the rest of us at drifting 'off topic'.)

Perry, I did understand your remark; I don't think you got the point
of mine; give me a fiber and a computer fast enough to use it and
sufficient disk space, and trust me, I'll find something to fill it
with.  Capacity increases to fill the available bandwidth/disk space/
whatever.  Just because you don't have the imagination to think of
how we'll use an essentially new medium in the future, don't write
it off already.
Here's one suggestion that is quite sensible given vast resources: instead of linear TV, we have parallel TV.  I don't mean dial-on-demand
download a program - I mean every single program ever made and every
single movie ever made are broadcast down fiber simultaneously; - you
want to see the 59th episode of Star Trek, you switch to the 59th
episode of Star Trek channel, where it's going round and round as
fast as it can be transmitted.
Now, you do the sums.  How much fiber does *that* need?  (When you've
done that one, add on the volume of transmitting a high-res scan of
every page of every book in the world...)
This may seem like an outrageous or stupid application *at the moment*,
but I guess the guy at Manchester in the 50's who thought his computer
would be enough to satisfy the needs of all our Universities over here
would have thought that using the entire resources of his 64K giant machine
to play Pacman on was totally insane, yet only 30 years later the same
power was available in hand-held toys costing $20.

I had a go at this just for fun when an8785 was doing his thing.  I'm
pretty sure I identified him correctly in the end.  (The guy I thought
it was, when I asked him, said 'If I were I wouldn't tell you', whereas
all the other people I suspected but not as strongly all denied it
violently, heh heh heh)
I think this sort of analysis could be automated to a reasonable
extent, to cut out the TypeI errors that the guys who did Shakespeare/Bacon
analysis made.  It's very easy to fool yourself if you don't have predefined
criteria of comparison and a rigid marking scheme.
I'm fairly sure that a sufficiently detailed analysis looking at enough
different points of style would still catch someone's fingerprint even if
they went out of their way to disguise their postings.  The only approach
I can think of that would be successful in hiding individual style is for
person A to write something, person B reads it quickly, then attempts to
write something with the same semantic content, but of course it will
have B's grammar and phraseology and punctuation idiosyncracies.  (And
this only works if B is not a net poster, otherwise you recognise B and
work out who his friends are :-) )

This may seem a little excessive, but the only sensible way to use
pgp in environments like yours or prz's (heh heh) is to set yourself
up with your own site at home, either with a dialup SLIP/PPP feed or
a plain and cheap uucp feed.  Both of those options are becoming much
cheaper than they used to be, and you can run suitable software on all
sorts of computers - whatever you're using to dial in to your timeshare
service at the moment would probably do, as long as its not just a dumb
terminal.  DOS, a free unix or linux, Amiga, Atari - they can all handle
at least uucp if not tcp/ip too.  If you don't have suitable hardware,
you can surelu find a 286 dos box with an old 20Mb drive and plain text-
only display secondhand somewhere for $200 or less...  that'll run UUPC
or even KA9Q.
If you care about privacy in your email, you *have* to run it all the
way into your own machine.

Just to let you know, this *is* happening.  I got so pissed off at the
postings here from anonymous remailers that I've now put them in my
kill file. (I gate this stuff into a local newsgroup and read it with
a newsreader).
Actually it wasn't the content of the articles that narked me, it was
that I actually wanted to *reply* to the authors.  However the subjects
were way too off-topic to be worth responding to in public, which is
the only option the anonymous remailers allows.  I've no objections
(and haven't kill'd) articles from penet etc that I can reply to.
I'm not entirely happy with the whole concept of 'hit&run' anonymous
remailers - they're only good for throwaway comments on public lists, or whistleblowing.  That's not how they're being used - they're forcing
people to have private conversations in public lists like this, which
I think is unfair to the rest of the list community - I'm *sure* it's
contributed to the number of people dropping off this list lately.

Excuse me butting in to a discussion I haven't really been following (I
don't have a lot of interest in remailers); I'm wondering if everyone
is missing some terribly obvious point here.
Without knowing too much about how the current anon/remail stuff works,
tell me what you think of this way of doing things (apologies if it's
what someone already does or has been discussed recently).
I want to mail fred at somesite anonymously.  I know fred at somesite's
public key.  I encrypt my message for fred, then send it to a
remailer address with instructions to pass it on to fred.  For a little
eavesdropping security, I include an anonymous pgp key of mine
in the mail to fred so that he can reply to me without the remailer
operators reading his mail.  You can choose your favourite syntax
for how I ask the remailer to send this mail to fred - I don't care
what it is.
The remailer then encrypts *my reply mail address* with the remailers own
key, and inserts this as a header in the mail which only it can read.
It attaches a little message to this header saying 'when you reply to
this message, be sure to include this opaque header I'm giving
you here...'
The recipient gets the mail, decodes it, reads it, and replies.
(Maybe encrypted with an anonymous public key I included in the
mail, maybe in cleartext - doesn't matter for the scheme) When
he replies, he included the small encrypted block that the remailer
gave him at the top of his message, as he was asked to do by the
The reply goes to the anonymous remailer.  The anonymous remailer
decrypts the header block that it searches the mail for, and
extracts my email address from it again.  The remailer then passes
the mail back to me - this time including an encrypted block with
the fred at somesite's address in it.  (Or some other address if
fred replied from another account; or perhaps I mailed a mail
to news gateway - well, my encrypted address will still work
even if a dozen people reply to the news article by mailing
via the remailer, and now I *don't* know who the encrypted
sender is)
In this way, once a conversation has been established, replies
can keep going backwards and forwards without much fancy protocol
at all - all you ever do is remember not to delete the encrypted
block that the remailer keeps inserting at the top of your mail.
And with this scheme, the remailer does not need to remember the
addresses of either the initial poster or the recipient, and
hence can't divulge them if the machine is hacked.  So it gives
you a combination of the penet-style mailer with return address,
and the cypherpunk-style mailer of throw-away anonymity -- as
long as you trust the remailer operator not to cheat and log
stuff anyway.  Of course, you then extend the scheme by the
same mechanisms that the cpunk remailers already use - chaining
from one remailer to the next... if done properly, the return
addresses should chain too, transparently, and the whole scheme
will remain easy to use.
Clearly this scheme is succeptible to mass logging of comms links
followed by a bust to grab the remailer's secret key, but that's
about par for the current remailers anyway.  This scheme is no
worse, and possibly quite a bit better.
So, have I just stated the obvious or is this a new idea to anyone?
PS Note this scheme doesn't need Matthew's hack for "+" in
usernames, which not everyone wanting to run a remailer in
say a private account on netcom etc would be able to install...
PPS I thought for fun I'd put a header of the kind I'm
talking about on this mail.  Anyone replying should note
it really *will* go to me, and you *won't* be anonymized ;-)

@_subject: Remailer reply addresses 
Ah!  I'm glad conversation on this thread has picked up - I was afraid
no-one was interested.
:Graham's suggestion about automatic remailer reply chains reminded me of
:a simpler system which I would like to see.
:Suppose one site, somewhere, would create new mail addresses upon request,
:and map them to encrypted remailer chain blocks.  (These are nested remailer
:requests, where the outer layer is encrypted for the first remailer and tells
:it where to send the message, the next layer is encrypted for the 2nd remailer
:and tells it where to send, and so on.  No remailer sees anything more than
:where it is sending the message and where it received it from.)  A new account
:is created which maps, say, to a file which has one of these "anonymous return
:addresses" in it.  Any mail incoming for that address simply gets sent to the
:remailer in the file, with the ARA stuck in front of it.
That's pretty much what I was thinking of, except you don't need the
pseudonym server.  I find this stuff easier to talk about with examples
than in general, so here's what I'm thinking about:
I mail to first remailer (R1).  The remailer inserts my reply address into
the mail, encrypted, and either mails it to the recipient if I gave one,
or to the next remailer if I specified a remailer chain - or to another
remailer at random on it's own whim if it feels like doing so.
Let's assume it's going to another remailer then.  This next remailer (R2)
takes the header block with my reply address in it, and prepends what *it*
sees as the reply address, ie remailer R1.  It then encodes this into an
identically-structured reply block, and inserts *that* in the mail instead
of the original reply block, before passing it on.
This can be repeated as often as desired - the mail will always have
only two parts where-ever it turns up - an encrypted reply-block and the
text.  Let's say it ends up on the n'th remailer, Rn.
When the real recipient gets the mail and replies to it, the reply goes
to remailer Rn, and Rn can decode the header block.  The decoded header block
contains an address, and extra text which happens to be a fully-formatted
header block itself.  This extracted, smaller, header block is put back into
the mail instead of the one which was just decoded, and the mail is sent
back to the address that was extracted.
eventually it goes through umpteen remailers, and R2 passes it back
to R1.  R1 decodes the header block, finds *only* the address - no
nested header block, and passes the mail back to the user at that
So the whole thing is really a trivial protocol - just
  email address
  djhfkjsdhfdshf (opaque text from previous encryptions) kjfhkdhfkdhfkd
  dfkdfkjdfkhdf  (possibly on multiple lines) jhldkjodkfdjfljdlfkjldjdl
Sure, this could be extended to put all sorts of neat features in
the encrypted area, but I rather like the simplicity of just keeping
it to a plain username at site on a single line.
:With this software I could do something which cannot be done today.  I could
:send mail to which someone could hit "r" to reply, and receive that reply,
:without any one person knowing my pseudonym.  This is not that much to ask
:for!  I'd say it is the bare minimum for the use of pseudonyms on the net,
:yet we don't have it, after all this time.  And look how close we are to
:being able to do it.
Absolutely!  That's what I want too.
:With this basic system in place, some of Graham's ideas about time-limited
:or use-limited pseudonyms could be applied as well.  Other extensions people
:have suggested would have the pseudonym server hold messages in inboxes until
:people trigger a dump to a freshly created anonymous address.  A lot of things
:are possible.
I agree entirely except I don't see the need for a pseudonym server - just
the normal remailer reply address should be enough (so that people who
can't create aliases can run this stuff on remailers out their personal
accounts) which is why I think the blinded reply addresses should be in
the *body* of the mails.  (Smart mail software would scan the text for
these and handle stuff like indentation etc.  It doesn't seem too difficult
- I already use procmail for something like this where I scan for PGP
blocks in mail and decrypt them on receipt where possible)
:But we should walk before we run.  Right now I don't feel that we are even
:crawling yet.

@_subject: New anon mailer idea? 
: Graham Toal's suggestion for automatic insertion of an encrypted
: return address block is interesting.  We had some discussion here last
: year of a similar approach, although Graham's twist of using a symmetric
: rather than PK cypher for the return address is new.  A few thoughts:
I'm not sure it matters; it was just to focus the mind on the point
that even if a PK cypher was being used in practice, it was *in effect*
a private key cypher because its security depended in part on keeping
the decoding key secret within the remailer.  Primarily I suggested
something like DES/IDEA because RSA keys are expensive to generate, and
for this scheme you definitely need one new password for every incoming mail.
:  - You'd want this feature to be optional.  Some people might not want
:    their anonymity limited by having their return address recorded, even
:    in encrypted form.
Yes, I agree.  I think Eric von Hollander is doing this for *every* posting
in the soda implementation he hacked up impressively quickly, and I'm not
sure that's wise. (Eric will correct me if I read his docs wrongly)  I've
a feeling some of his customers might complain when they realise!  (*I*'m
not complaining - I think it's great that he added this feature so quickly)
:  - Graham is right about the advantages of use-once (or use-only-a-few-times)
:    return addresses.  Chaum discusses how multiple use of return addresses
:    allows these systems to be broken, similar to the way Graham describes.
I also hope Eric is using individually-created DES keys for every incoming
post and not a single shared key.  That would be a serious risk.  I get
the impression he's not, from his comment about the system being vulnerable
to known-plaintext attacks.  (Eric, if I'm right, could you change your
hack to use disposable DES keys asap please?)
:  - The use of a symmetric cypher is a very nice way of getting the use-once
:    capability, along with the "burn after reading" effect of a remailer
:    chain which destroys itself as it goes.  But it could be a considerable
:    burden on the remailer operator to maintain the database.  One possibility
:    would be to fix a maximum time limit on how long the return addresses are
:    kept "alive" and require some real money to keep them longer.
I'm not sure I agree with that.  Actually I think the database management
might be trivial - here's one suggestion. Let's say the invented random
key is a hex string - well, we need 64 bits for a DES key, that's 16 hex
digits, so lets be generous and make our random hex string 24 digits
instead.  We just take the first six digits as an identifying tag and
use that tag as a filename to store the rest of the key.  The tag is
output in front of the encrypted block too, so when you come to decrypting
the data, it's a straight file-open call to find the correct key.  We
don't have the problem here that we do with the pgp key-id's clashing,
because if the key generator returns a clash, it can easily generate
a second key.
(If you're saying that deleting time-expired keys is onerous, well,
it's just a case of mastering the unix 'find' command ;-) )
So if you're saying that finding a key will be expensive, I disagree;
if you're saying that the database might get rather large, I do agree.
Since these reply tokens aren't the same as well-known anonymous addresses,
maybe it's sensible to insist from the start that they have a lifetime
of no more than (say) a year; which can be shortened by user request on
creation, but not extended.
This is a plus feature in my opinion, because it avoids the problems
Julf has had with lots of stale ID's needing to be purged.
:  - What we would really like is for the recipient to hit the "reply" button
:    and be able to send his mail back.  It sounds like this system would still
:    require some cut-and-paste.  We already have programs to create encrypted
:    remailer chain addresses fairly automatically.  It would be nice to automate
:    this last little bit.  Unfortunately, there seems to be no easy way to
:    make this work under Graham's scheme.
No, I don't think that any cut and paste is required *at all* over the
normal inclusion of the sender's mail in your reply.  The remailer could
grep the body of the mail for the magic tokens that delimit such a
header block, and find it that way.  (Allowing for indentation markers
etc - not hard - the current usenet voting software does something
similar) eg if you had:
in your mail, you can see it's still pretty easy for a program to extract
the encoded bit... - just find the magic start token, note the stuff on
the line before it, and strip similar stuff out until it finds the end
:  - It doesn't look like this would be an easy drop-in to the current remailers,
:    unfortunately.  The syntax for how the address would be built up as it
:    passes through a chain of remailers is a little unclear as well.
I've discussed this in a previous post.  I think it's actually easy.
The very first message goes out from the first remailer looking like this:
(original text is the single line:
username at real_site.com
which encodes to:
*** Remailer reply block ***
*** End remailer reply block***
which is inserted at the top of the mail.
The next remailer extracts the encoded data, and prepares this text:
last_remailer at wherever.edu
and encodes it, and sends it out in the mail in place of the
original block, looking like this:
*** Remailer reply block ***
*** End remailer reply block***
(OK, slight poetic licence here - I'm using 1 1:1 cypher; in fact
you'd expect the text to get bigger each time to cover the binary
encoding method used)
So the net effect is that the encoded text gets larger, but the
mail is otherwise identical as it passes from site to site.
: The idea does have a lot of promise, though, and I think it is definately
: worth keeping in mind for the next generation of remailers.
I might even start using them myself :-)
One more point...
I've been saying that the encrypted reply block is most easily
thought about if *all* it contains is an email address.  I think in
practice you'd probably want to be able to store arbitrary remailer
flags in here, like the command 'delete this DES key as soon as
you've handled this reply' - this would in fact be more robust
than keeping the same information in the DES key file itself, which
was my original suggestion.  And it would allow fairly arbitrary
extension of the whole scheme.  One way of implementing it that
I can see is if the encrypted part of a block was a series of
mail-header-like lines, eg:
The cleartext would be:
Reply-To: gtoal at an-teallach.com
Initial-Usage-Limit: 5
Expire-Completely-After: 12/25/94
Decrement-Use-Count-By: 1
Random-Remailer-Hops-Left-In-M&M-Machine: 3
which would be wrapped and inserted in the usual way.

: Which is why my remailer uses 3DES and adds random padding to the
: address before encrypting it.  Random padding will thwart many chosen
: plaintext attacks, especially if you do some transpositions prior to
: encrypting it.  Since the text to encrypt is so small, doing five or ten
: consecutive DES encryptions with different keys would not use up much
: CPU time, but could dramatically increase security.  Also I compress the
: address slightly by stripping off the high bits so that 8 bytes fit into
: 7.  Just a few suggestions to keep in mind...
You beat me to it :-)  I was going to suggest xoring the data with a set
of random numbers (generated along with the des key) to shield it from
known plaintext, but a few rounds of DES might do just as well.  You have
to do *something* because there's a known-plaintext ' in every email addr.
: Overall, looks pretty good.  BTW, what's the number that it prepends to
: your email address when you get a reply?
The things I'd improve on it are the need to edit out the indentation
when you use the header block in a reply, and that you have to move the
block from the end of the file to the top.  Either it should start
out at the top, or the remailer should search the whole mail for it.
On chaining reply blocks:  I was wrong about them getting larger and
larger as they went through remailers - you don't have to encode the
ascii representation of the last remailer's block and then ascii
encode that too - you could generate your block by first de-ascii'ing
the last block, prepending the return address, and then re-ascii'ing it.
That way the previous return addresses would contribute the same size
of data in every link in the chain.
One thing more has to be done to foil traffic analysis - the encrypted
email address has to be padded out a lot so that they can't guess who
it was by knowing the lengths of the email addresses of a small set
of possible posters.  Assuming we're already stripping out the personal
names etc in email addreses and just keeping the canonical bits (for
example "Graham Toal"   ->   gtoal at gtoal.com
then I'd suggest padding with spaces to something like 64 chars, then
going up +64 each time for those X400 idiots who might want to post
through us :-)  That way you won't be able to tell a 128-byte long name
from 2 hops of a 64-byte short name.

@_subject: New anon mailer idea? 
Yep, that's one way that fits in with the cypherpunk remailer syntax;
another way would be to have a separate address that you used to explicitly
start a conversation, eg reply-remailer at somewhere.edu
Hmmm... you could in fact make the Generate-Return-Address: header take
the actual return address you want to use, like a Reply-To: header.  That
would be nice.  (I'd been assuming that it would use the normal reply
address - Reply-To:, From:, envelope address; in that order depending on
which was given)
Exactly my thoughts.  Or make it a stream cypher with random IV.
I think you missed the point - with your scheme it's still technically
possible to decrypt the address years afterwards - you're relying on the
remailer to always stay secure; with a delete-the-key scheme you couldn't
even if you were hung upsidedown from the ceiling from your toenails by the
gestapo.  (Though you might want to...) - so a corrupted remailer would
limit damage to only live keys that arrived after it was corrupted and not
its entirely history of dead ones from the period beforehand.
The problem is 99% of mailers don't support that syntax, and although
it can be added by clever sendmail hacks, it can't be added unless you
have root access, and the philosophy of cypherpunk remailers/keyservers/etc
is that they run on random accounts with no special privileges.  Hence
why putting the address in the body is more portable.  Also random
remailer names are likely to draw less attention in your system's
outgoing-mail logs that addresses that are obvious remailers.
I don't like the idea of replying and no knowing if it'll get there -
in fact, I meant to say earlier, if a reply is sent on a key that has
expired I'd expect the remailer to bounce an error report back saying
that the key had expired.

When you're exhaustively testing keyspaces, or getting hard crypto

above is in the main inner loop (say 80% of the CPU time as gleaned
from a profile utility), the optimisations people suggested will
speed your program up by a factor of 10.  This is the one time
that bit-twiddling optimisations are worthwhile.  (Mostly they're

Using branches is seriously bad news on some machines, especially

on it for a week.  I think the best version in the end was a variation
of the trick shown earlier and some sneaky use of ARM conditionals and
address-loading instructions that could do arbitrary shifts on the fly
while adding.
I wish I'd kept it.  If anyone bumps into Paul Bond, I think he was
the guy who wrote the best one.  I'd like to see that one again for
nostalgia's sake :-)

Do you think we'd all be spending weeks on it if it were that easy?
Or are you suggesting that 32-bits of address space of RAM is reasonable
for this problem?  Even if it's a 16-bit table you still have to do the
add; worse, the non-local access shits all over the bus timings and
the cache.  Much better to avoid going off-chip and keep the CPU
running at full speed (which might be 100 times faster than memory).
Again, remember we're nottalking about PCs here but real computers.
PS I dunno what superoptimisizer Perry is talking about but I've
never heard of a real one that works.  You have to feed in a complete
machine description at register transfer level and i don't know if
those exist for real machines; also the problem is almost certainly
exponential time for a *guaranteed* solution as Perry claims is

as unbelievably fast as long as they are executing *on-chip* - as soon as
they have to go to RAM for a table lookup, they suffer a performance hit
equivalent to executing large amounts of in-line instructions - one array

has to be found for critical inner-loop stuff.  The precise details vary
according to the pipelining and the amount of on-cpu instruction cache.

I've been pondering this for some time.  I think it's time to try a
new experiment in anonymous remailing.  I think that all remailers
should close down, then open up with new addresses and a single shared
new policy... the new policy being that each individual remailer will
do his best to 'out' all posters - complete disclosure, log files
available, posts available, summaries show up via finger etc etc.
Give *us* the same access to the info that the LEAs have, and let us
try to work out who is posting what.  This puts the onus on the posters
to use the encryption and chaining features, and on us to generate
our spoofing traffic and delay mail and whatever else it takes to
foil traffic analysis.
Also, we automatically bounce submissions in plaintext at the point
of entry - the only cleartext should be at the point of exit (and not
even that if it's personal mail rather than news postings).
And we should not guarantee service.  Postings can get lost for whatever
reason.  If someone wants to kill postings in cleartext at the point of
delivery to newsgroups or mailing lists, let them.  That should stop the
Detweilers and place the responsibility of abusing the remailers on
the shoulders of the remailer operators.  If an abusive posting is
sent to news from remailer X, it's clear remailer X was the one that
passed it on and had the cleartext available.  And with a new policy
of outing everyone automatically, people *know* we'll read the
cleartext at the point of delivery.
This seems to me more consistent with the cypherpunk ideal of users
securing their own privacy, rather than trusting someone.

Again, fixing this up would be for the better good.  You can just imagine
that the FBI is already watching all remailers closely under arm-twisting

likewise for their own reasons.  I think we *should* force ourseles to make
traffic analysis visibly impossible.  If we can crack an anon posting
path with the same information available to an attacker who can monitor
all the lines, our system is broken.  We should put it up for peer-group
testing just like a new encryption algorithm.  I believe the security
of current remailers is a joke against a real attack.  It's *only*
good enough to hide identity from other usenet readers.  We might
as well all use only one-hop remailers and stop kidding ourselves
that the multi-hop stuff does any good at all.
(I don't believe the anti-traffic analysis support of the current remailers
is any good, which is why any postings I've made through remailers have
been single-hop in clear.  I just don't post anything that would get me
in legal trouble.  OK, maybe a couple of posts I've made would be
personally embarrassing if I were outed, but I wouldn't be by any LEAs
that were watching.  They'd just be able to use logged postings in
criminal cases)

I meant that cleartext *input* should be prevented.  Cleartext output
however can be 'outed' in accordance with policy, even if it's personal
mail.  Also it can be silently dropped on the floor by the last-hop admin
without any comeback, for whatever egregious reason he chooses, or even
randomly.  It's up to the sender to pick a route that works.  If some remailer
admin (like JGdeA, or was it John Stanley?) choses to allow M.M.F postings,
then he can take the heat for them personally.
It's impossible to tell an email recipient apart from a mail to news
gateway, so we can't enforce encrypted output only, if we allow
posting.  However, the 'outing' policy makes it in people's best
interests to encrypt to the destination user if they can.
Unencrypted *mail* as well as news is also fair game for the
last-hop remailer admin to delete on his personal whim.
PS When I say we should out all information, I'm only talking about
information that's visible going in and out.  If we ever get my
earlier idea of chained encrypted reply-addresses to work, with
time-sensitive keys that are deleted after a few days, I'm not
suggesting publishing those keys.  Certainly, we should assume
that a few sites will be broken into, or even many sites, but
as long as one site remains uncompromised, there's a strong link
in the chain that holds up the entire chain.

I said in my previous post that that wasn't what I had meant, but thinking

the functionality of anon posting to news, people could set up news
gateways that accepted encrypted articles for posting, decrypted them,

Thus you can take a stream of data, split it up into 4 bits, and
hamming encode each nibble.  Then you give 1 bit from each output
byte to a different person.  The original file can be rebuilt if
6 of the 8 people get together - effectively you're decoding each
8-bit byte by assuming that the bits from the two missing people
were corrupted in transit (ie any value you supply will do)
Error-correcting codes are well understood (though not necessarily
by me ;-) ) and can be tailored to any n of m, eg you could have a
code that took 24-bit units, made a 100-bit output word, and could
rebuild the original 24-bit word by having access to only say 70 of
the 100 bits.
The application of this to secret sharing is obvious.
What isn't so obvious is that since these codes are designed for
data transmission rather than data hiding, you're liable to
find that for some bit positions in the output word, you have
a direct copy of one of the input bits!  So in my first example
above where 4 bits mapped to 8 bits, 4 of the 8 bits of output
were actually just the four input bits even though the other
4 bits were in some way random 'check bits'.
So just by finding the right 4 people and analysing the data
you'd get if you took their bits as actual data, you could
tell whether you'd found the cleartext bits or not.
Thus a straight Hamming code can't be used to split secrets; I'm
not sure of the modifications necessary - I *think* it might be
enough to whiten the input data with random noise, but I'm far
far less than 100% convinced of this.  I'll have to think about
it some other time when I don't have as much on my mind.
I expect some textbook has already covered the application of
these things to cryptography.  Wish I had one :-(

Don't be such a condescending shit.  We read your post clearly enough,
thank you very much. Typical control-freak crap.  If you want your
little xtian kids to be namby-pamby'd on the net, start up your own
business and offer them restricted access yourself, but don't try to
tell the rest of us how to run our systems.  It's the responsibility
of the parents to restrict the children's access, not the net.  I've
no more against a Falwell-style BBS than I have against their loony
TV channels, just don't force me to have to use one.  By all means
encourage proper upstanding xtian parents to fund a suitable system for
their own children to use, but lay off the regulation bullshit.  That

You don't get it.
I LIKE PGP. I grabbed it when I first saw it. Only when I found it infringed
RSADSI's patents did I feel I needed to take action.
That action was a deliberate strategy:
1. I worked behind the scenes urging Jim Bidzos of RSADSI to find a way to
license PGP. I did so in a sustained and intense way. Ask him. We discussed
many options, and he checked with his lawyers on each one. (I was not the
only one and claim no special credit).
2. In order to persuade Jim it was clear to me that I had to defend his
patent rights in public. Any attempt to force PGP down his throat was doomed
to fail in my view. Thus I gave no quarter, and no comfort to those
attacking RSADSI, following a strategy of deliberate provocation, or in any
way making it harder for Jim to compromise (recall that HE has the patent,
not the PGP fans. Recall also that it is an MIT/Stanford University patent,
not some commercial exploiter of the civil liberties of the downtrodden.)
3. In a small number of instances I saw some underhanded cheating going on
that could threaten sites I use and benefit from. By "underhanded cheating"
I mean posting infringing software which I had good reason to believe put
sites at risk with neither the permission nor knowledge of the site admins
or owners. I have never objected to individuals putting PGP up on their own
computers with full knowledge of the risks they were taking. In conversations with Jim he told me he was going to go after those sites
and close them down. I didn't want that to happen, so I reported the
background to a very few sites I used, leaving the site admins to make up
their own minds what to do. In one case a user was asked to remove PGP and
did. In another case it was taken down. In a third case the site declined to
get involved. Note that in each case I was a party at interest and felt I
might be damaged by the consequences of PGP being up there; rightly or
wrongly my conversations with Bidzos led me to believe he was preparing
imminent action, and I thus took my own action to warn sites I used, to
protect myself from the possibility of losing their services.
I have explained this repeatedly, but the PGP infringers, having not a leg
to stand on, decided to react with a smoke screen of vilification,
defamation, and falsehoods about my motives, and even my bona fides, since
they could not confront the issues honestly and directly given their dirty
hands in the matter. For some of the worst excesses, read this week's New
Yorker article: "My First Flame."
That's it. There was never a hidden agenda, or the assumption of any net.cop
role--I acted to protect a very few sites I benefitted from, and even then
only by presenting the facts and leaving it up to the admins. I acted in a
way designed form the start to get a non-infringing PGP available in the
Thus if anyone won, I did. I now have what I've been seeking all along, a
non-infringing version of PGP, thanks to MIT. The de facto standard version
of PGP in the U.S. is properly licensed by RSADSI. It will drive out the
infringing versions in very short order and we can all, honestly and
legally, use PGP.
If anyone lost, it is the juvenile thugs flaunting their disobedience to
authority. PGP hit its limits with the infringing version in the U.S. No
serious company or law abiding professional would consider it as long as it
was under a cloud. Now the infringing versions are about to become history,
and using PGP 2.6 in the U.S. is an act of legitimacy, not an act of
disobedience to authority or disrespect for patents one doesn't like. Those
with authority figure problems will have to find another "cause"--they've
now been very effectively deprived of this one by the simple expedient of
respect for others' property. It was a long, hard fight, but in the end,
despite the obfuscation, slime, lies, defamation, playground bully, and
hoodlum tactics of a short list of people--names available on request :-) --
the good guys won.

upgraded his copy of majordomo about a week ago.  If he hasn't, he should.
PS Was a 22 line message for 3 lines of content really necessary?

Whoever it is on illuminati.io.com forging mail to cslaw with a

not the only person from io.com who reads this group.  This sort of
trivial forgery is easy to track down if anyone could be bothered.

Not funny.
Perhaps he forgot to remove his sig file, on the other hand there is no-one
obviously called Douglas on illuminati.

wording, but it was the sort of thing you'd imagine the head of any big
organisation like that would want to say but was never in a position to

Didn't anyone notice that someone posted a putative source code for
the secret A5 algorithm as used in GSM phones?  (It was on sci.crypt
xposted to uk.telecom, on Friday).  Seems someone was going to give
a talk on ways of hacking the algorithm, at some university, and he
got stomped on by CGHQ.  So another guy has come out in sympathy and
posted his reconstruction of the algorithm in C as reverse engineered
from a hardware description he received in a plain brown envelope!
This is *significantly* more of a coup on the net that the NSA handbook.
Now, all I need is for you guys to explain coherently *why* it's a
good coup and what the political implications are, and I'll feed the
story to the UK press.  (I don't think anyone here has it yet...)

: From: Rusty Hodge : 3. There is a test mode defined in the NAMPS standard that causes a phone
: to begin transmitting on a designated frequency. And since the mouthpiece
: on a cellular phone is not switched off when the phone is on hook, you can
: easily bug someone's car this way.
Woo! Built-in infinity-transmitter mode!  (Just like ISDN actually)
: 6. For under $1000, you can buy a box which hooks up to a PC and controls a
: scanner and decodes the cellular control channels (and reverse channel data
: too). This includes software for following cellular calls as they hop from
: cell to cell, paging requests (get a phones attention), and displaying the
: MINs that register in a given cell (or cells, but you need one receiver for
: each cell you are monitoring!).
These are selling on the black market over here in Britain for 3 or 4 K
pounds.  People who buy them use them to close phones, then sell time on the
cloned phone over a weekend before it's discovered.

@_subject: How to do encrypted telnet without being root (tutorial, includes src) 
People have been talking about encrypted telnets for ages, but I still
haven't seen one I can easily use.  And most suggestions would actually
require a sysadmin to install a special telnet daemon.  Here's a suggestion
for how to do encrypted telnet sessions *without* any system code.
It's quite simple - there's a process called 'remote' which sits between
your keyboard/screen and the actual machine you're using.  Very much like
the way the 'script' program works, or perhaps 'screen' (though the latter
is much much more complex than script).  'remote' encrypts all screen
Next, there's a program called 'local'; you run local on your directly-
connected local host.  Normally local is transparent, and works again
pretty much like 'script' (except of course there's no logging :-) );
however when local sees a certain magic string has been printed, it
then assumes the data following will be encrypted, and it decrypts
everything that's sent to your screen. (This 'in band' data is a little
unclean, but it's what makes the whole scheme possible in user-level code)
Actually it's *slightly* more complicated than this; when local sees
the magic string, it starts up a conversation with whatever it's running
on top of, and does some sort of key exchange to use with the encryption.
(This conversation works by looking at the data that would otherwise be
sent to the screen, and replying by simulating data as if it had been
I took two hours last night to actually hack up a version of these programs
- the hack uses rot13 as its encryption method, and the key exchange is
completely bogus.  But it does show the method in action, and it wouldn't
take much to adapt this to use a real encryption function.  Left as the
proverbial exercise for the reader.
So, in summary...
% local
% telnet remotehost  # (one that lets you log in with a 1-time password?)
% remote
Here's an actual log of such a session.  I run the remote program first just
to show you that the encryption does something - the process is so
transparent that you might not follow it otherwise :-)
Anyway, the point of this mechanism is that - like pgp - it is *user*
code that you can take with you anywhere; you don't need the co-operation
of the sys admins at each pair of sites you use.
If anyone wants to take this ball and run with it to produce something
that's a little more secure than rot13, be my guest.  The only copyright
here is the Berkeley one attached to the original 'script' source.  Once
you've got the idea, you might consider rewriting that bit from scratch too.

And for your edification, here's the code. (bsd systems only - tested
on BSDI and 386BSD)
*BIG NOTE*... there are (ahem) one or two rather hacky bits in here.
As I said, it was a two-hour hack just to prove the point that code
like this can be written easily and it doesn't take a systems manager
to install it.  (Also, being code you compile yourself, you might
trust it a little more).  Noticably the rot13 encryption neatly
allows me to avoid problems sending binary data.  Doing this for
real, your output to screen/read from output stream code should
encode each encrypted byte as two hexascii bytes for portability;
also a few newlines here and there to keep the buffers flushed
wouldn't hurt.  And there's a *filthy* piece of code to do keyboard
stuffing in here.  This is *not* how you'd do it in a production
program.  A security hole a mile wide.  I couldn't be bothered
learning how to do internal pipes for this quick proof-of-concept
hack, so I used a file in /tmp to communicate through...
*BIG NOTE  This only does screen output; keyboard input is also
left as a trivial exercise to the reader...

@_subject: How to do encrypted telnet without being root (tutorial, includes src) 
True - that's why I suggested using one-time passwords before you
get to that stage.  I'm using s/key myself.  If you can't install
s/key checking in login, you can use an s/key shell as a user
process (assuming you can change your shell that is).
By the way, S/Key *doesn't* need an intelligent card - you can do
what I do and print off 100 passwords small on a credit-card slip.
I fetched it as soon as I discovered this.  It's not a perfect
system but it helps.

@_author: Graham Toal 
@_subject: Update on user-level hack to do telnet encryption posted recently 
OK folks, I've started tidying up that hack code I posted recently which
outlined a method for rolling your own telnet-style encryption.  In particular,
I've done the hard bit of making it work with an arbitrary binary 1:1 stream
cypher, rather than the original hack which *had* to encrypt printable text
as printable text (to get it through 7 bit terminal links).
[Note, anyone who didn't look at it too closely because they thought it was
only for telnet - look again: it's useful for *any* local to remote connection,
even kermit down a serial line, as long as you're calling between unixes.]
Now, what I need are volunteers - preferably outside the US and any other
country where any relevant patents are valid - to work on a suitable stream
cypher.  Note you don't have to use any patented technology, as long as
whatever you come up with is sufficiently secure for your needs - this will
eventually be issued as a modular system, with the default encryption module
being rot13.  If you don't really care much about the strength of encryption
(assuming your only opponents are kids who sniff packets who won't have
enough crypto experience to decode even an trivial cypher) then there's
a lot to be said for everyone implementing their own variation... just for
the amusement of tying up the time of all those more competant people who
feel they have to know everything that's going on everywhere in the world.
Machine cycles they can afford aplenty; man years are a different question...
Anyway, back to the project:
Currently there's a trivial interface that you can work to - I suggest
for demo purposes just using a hard-coded known key at each end, and we'll
do the key exchange stuff after we've got the stream cypher working.
Here's the header file:
 STATE_SIZE 128
typedef struct cypherstate {
  char *unique_tag;
  char whatever[STATE_SIZE];
  long int byteno;
  /* Add useful stuff here as need be... */
} CYPHER_STATE;
void new_cypher(CYPHER_STATE *s, char *unique_tag);
char stream_cypher(CYPHER_STATE *s, char byte);
Put any state you need in the struct, initialise it (with a known secret
key for now) in new_cypher; and supply a function that does a 1:1 encoding
of a byte in stream_cypher.  Make the function stateless apart from the
CYPHER_STATE parameter so that it can be used to encode multiple streams
without interference.
With a bit of help from you guys, this project shouldn't take more than
a week to get a prototype running...  When I have a feel for what sort
of encryption methods people want, and how precisely they're implemented,
I'll know better how to generically code the key-exchange part too.
I don't think it's appropriate for me to post any more source over
the net.  Anyone who wants to discuss this in public rather than by mail,
I suggest we stick to alt.sources.d
Anyone wants the current sources, send mail to gtoal at an-teallach.com
PS The sources I have probably won't work anywhere except on BSD systems.
If you want to make the framework bit work on other versions of unix,
drop me a line about that too.  Your programming will have to be up to the
level of writing a clone of the unix 'script' command, which is all this
program is really.
PPS Americans: please don't get either you or me in trouble by mailing
me unsolicited gifts of crypto code.  I don't want it.  The crypto part
of this project is for those people in countries where there's no legal
barrier to them participating.

@_subject: Update on user-level hack to do telnet encryption posted recently 
Perry, I'm no longer interested in what you have to say.  You've been
a wet blanket and have pooh-poohed every practical suggestion I've
ever seen anyone making - weren't you one of the first people to
post to the netphone project telling us we were all wasting our time?
Cypherpunks write code, except when asked not to by Perry Metzger.
The point of this code, in case you missed it, is so that people can
take responsibility for their own encryption and not have to trust
software installed by someone else, just like we all use pgp rather
than Clipper.
Now, if you don't have anything useful to contribute, shut up and stop
trying to discourage those who do.

@_author: Graham Toal 
@_subject: Update on user-level hack to do telnet encryption posted recently 
Perry, I *already* have the bsd4.4 Kerberized telnet with DES that comes with
the BSDI distribution (original code in the US, a re-implementation on
supplementary floppies in the UK) - I've had it for half a year now,
and you know what? - it's of no use to me at all.  Not *one* of the dozen
odd sites I telnet to is running it.  Maybe in several years time we'll
all be running the same encrypted telnet, but for now I want *something*
to keep the nosey little kids from reading my packets and if I have to
ftp a short source and compile it every time I log in somewhere then
that's what I'll do.  I bet my telnet sessions are secure a lot sooner
than yours are.  The degree of that security depends to some extent on
how much help I get implementing a stream cypher because I'm not sure I
trust myself to do it properly.  So I would really appreciate if you
don't think this project is worthwhile, that you simply don't contribute
rather than going out of your way to encourage others not to as well.

It's precisely because of the CIA's illegal funding of covert activities
(ones they can't even get a black budget for) that I posted on eff.talk,
the day that Ames was uncovered, that he most likely slipped through the
detection-net of overspending precisely *because* agencies like this and
the CIA cooperate to hide the illegal income of top CIA agents.  It's
almost certain that FINCen has tweaked their algorithm specifically to
bypass people like Ames.  And we still haven't seen the drug connection
in that case surface.  But don't worry, it will.   Head of anti-drugs
operations for the last  years?  Don't kid me...

PS London has the same degree of camera surveillance as you said
Germany has.  There's a big centre at Kings Cross Station where
all the Railway Police have their monitors (of all the Underground
entrances) and another one at New Scotland Yard where all the transport police have theirs.  The ones in the underground - which
are ostensibly just for mass crowd volume monitoring - have an
absolutely deadly killer zoom lens that's centrally steerable.

*If* this were true (which I strongly doubt at the 99% confidence level),
it would work not with metal detection but with detection of a tuned
circuit which would oscillate at a harmonic if you broadcast a certain
frequency at it.  There are several patents for such circuits - they're
used in little strips that are slid down the spine of library books
for instance.
It could only ever be a gross detection measure - I guess it could be
made to catch sums considerably over the 10,000$ cash limit quite
But the fact is, people can strip a bill down and *look* at these things
for themselves.  I seriously doubt any such technology would remain
invisible to some lab hack who in an idle moment put it under his SEM

The trouble with the cypherpunk remailers is there isn't a single
one of them I'd trust.  The overwhelming credo of the sort of person
I've met in this area is that they want extreme absolute privacy
for *themselves* but sneak and spy on everything they possibly
can about everyone else.  (Oops - that sounds bad - I don't specifically
mean the people who run cypherpunk remailers; I mean people who're
obsessive about secrecy in general and hackers in particular.  Secretive
hackers being the worst.)
And you can take it as read that every remailer will be logged by the
Black Hats too.  Only double-blinded *encrypted* remailing is going
to have any chance of maintaining secrecy, and then only if you go
out of your way to explicitly chain round dozens of remailers in the
hope of finding *one* that isn't compromised.  (And that, only if all
the remailers are regularly spoofing traffic between themselves to foil
traffic analysis)

I had a STRANGE experience with one of the Hack-Tic phones this week.
It all started on Friday, June 12th when the modem hooked up to the
Waffle station that is posting this message (and all the other traffic
from and to the hacktic.nl domain) did not work anymore. I started up
LanAssist to control the Waffle station and initiated a poll to our
Internet host 'sun4nl'. The Waffle station is in our 'server closet'.
It's an unattended and diskless 286 with no keyboard or monitor hooked
The modem picked up the line and a high-pitched tone came from the
modem speaker.
So the modem is broken I thought. I started up Telix and 'talked' to
the modem directly. Same high-pitched tone. I reset the modem. Same
tone.  This modem is fairly new, and although it had functioned
properly most of the time, we were not really happy with it because
the V42bis mode wasn't totally 'hang-proof'. So we concluded: the
modem is broken.
The next day Felipe and Paul came over and tried to fix the problem.
Felipe and Paul are the Hack-Tic network trouble-shooting team. They
brought two other high-speed modems to confirm that the modem was
broken. They hooked up number one and tested it. Same high-pitched
After a few very puzzled looks we had to make a wild assumption: It
wasn't our flaky equipment that was at fault; it could be the
well-oiled machinery of The Phone Company that was messed up.
Bill, our chief telephone engineer, well known to all of you for his
'sometimes-a-little-too-knowledgeble' posts quickly hooked up a
telephone (that had not been attached to that line before) and picked
it up. Same high-pitched tone. The dial-tone was audible in the
background, but overpowered by the tone. The dialtone had been there
all the time but the quality of the average modem speaker leaves
something to be desired.
When he hooked up our New York Telephone test-set he noticed that the
high-pitched tone was even there when the phone was on the hook. Bill
used the Demon-Dialer (our homebrew high-precision tone-generator) and
found out that the tone was EXACTLY 3000 Hz, so it had to be crystal
generated. This ruled out any spurious oscillations.
As a last check we went to the point where all the wires come into our
flat. We unscrewed the wires leading in and clipped the test-set onto
the wires leading out. Same high-pitched tone. That Saturday night the
error was reported to the PTT and that was it. So we thought.
On Sunday the problem was still there (the PTT only fixes things in
the weekend if you are a major customer that is planning on buying one
of their PBXs). Bill checked to see that the tone was still there by
picking up the test set that was still plugged in. Then I picked up
our voice-line to make an outgoing call to Felipe.
Bill's face went through several emotions within a few seconds.
Finally he said 'Hmmm ... ehrr .... pfah ...'. When I looked at him
rather puzzled he added: 'hgggggnaaaah ...'.
I told Felipe to hold on. Bill started explaining that he heard my
voice on the other line, but that it sounded scrambled. I asked Nils
(who was also here, it's usually rather busy here) to talk to Felipe
for a while and took the test-set from Bill.
Yep, it was there all right. Scrambled voices.
   -------------------------------------------------------------
   Short Intermezzo About Voice Scrambling
   One of the easiest ways to scramble someone's voice is to
   invert the speech. It works as follows: you take a tone and
   subtract the audio from it. In more technical terms: You
   single-sideband modulate the audio onto the tone.
   Dutch police uses this technique extensively for their medium
   security traffic. Every real scanner-freak has a retrofit in
   his scanner to undo this. It does keep the absolute lamers
   from listening in I guess.
   Speech inversion may be a quite simple process that does not
   involve many parts, but it is by no means something that
   happens at random. (Or at least not in a voice-frequency
   environment)
   -------------------------------------------------------------
Now there is a lot of thing that can go wrong in a phone system that
cause a tone. Causing a frequency inversion of the audio on one line
to another line is quite something else. Especially if you know that
both lines are hooked up to different COs. The data line is hooked up
to a fully digital Ericcson AXE switch, the voice line goes to a PRX
(Processor Reed Exchange), which compares to a 1A/ESS in US terms.
We spent the rest of that sunday looking for alternatives for what
seemed to be the only possible conclusion: someone had hooked up
something to our line that did not belong there. Even more so: they
had messed up badly.
I decided that the time had come for some social engineering. I had
barely used my engineering skills since I had more or less given up on
my active hack/phreak career and started publishing a hacker-magazine.
This Monday (June 15th) I called the main access number of the PTT
Amsterdam office and asked for the number of the Diemen
'hoofdverdeler', where my lines come in. The 'hoofdverdeler' is where
all the lines for an entire area come in. They are split up to the
offices serving that area from there.
The phone at extension 2018 (+31 20 674 2018 to be precise) was
answered by Fred. I explained that I was a service mechanic (I only
used my first name, like they all do) at a customer's house and that
there seemed to be a strange tone on the line. I was not the first to
tell him of the problem. In fact, he had allready received a call from
another service mechanic trying to fix the problem. He said that the
line was rewired using colorcode-2, a code, he explained, that they
don't normally use in that office. The in- and outgoing point for my
data-line did connect according to his beep-device, but they were
different wires.
I asked him to follow the wires, and he did. He came back to the phone
to tell me that my line had been hooked up to a small rack that he had
never seen before. He looked further and concluded that it was the
rack for internal lines to that building. When I asked him to clip my
line loose from that rack he said that he could not do that. Because
if it was not his color code, his instructions were not to mess with
it. He said that this was the first time he saw so many of 'us from
outside works' working on something. Knowing I could not convince him,
and having all the information I wanted, I said goodbye and hung up.
I thought about this for a while and decided to call Fred back and
play it open with him. I told him that I was the subscriber, and not a
technician. I told him what I thought the device was. He did not
dispute my theory, but did not confirm it either. We chatted for quite
a while.  He wanted to know where my telephone knowledge came from,
and I explained about Hack-Tic, phreaking, international signalling
systems and so forth. When I asked him if he had seen lines with
code-2 before he hasitated for about five seconds and said: 'Well,
your line is being fixed. I'd say just wait and see'. I knew I was
asking a question that he was not allowed to answer. We hung up.
By this time our mailbox had been emptied, and it revealed a card from
a service mechanic that had apparently tried to visit us early that
moring (all morning is early to hackers). So I called the office and
made an appointment for the morning of the next day, knowing that the
problem would probably be gone by then.
For the next few hours I heard people testing on the modem line
(little ticks). But as evening came, the beep was still there.
So early this morning, a man from the PTT arrived. He looked at the
problem and was quite puzzled by it. He then said that they could not
locate the problem, but that he believed that it was located between
the office and me. In a sense this was true, because the 'hoofdverdeler' is indeed between the office and me. He decided to work around the
problem.  He whipped out a cell-phone and called his buddies at the
other end.  Together they put my line on a completely different wire
leading from the CO to here. No more high-pitched tone.
As I write this on Thursday afternoon, it all still needs a little
time to sink in. It seems that the only conclusion is that somebody
wanted to tap my lines, and hooked up the two lines that they wanted
tapped to the in- and output of the tapping device instead of using
two inputs. So the audio that was supposed to be fed to them
(scrambled so that anybody just testing the wire could not hear what
was going on) came back on my second line. The 3000 Hz tone was used
to indicate that the line was not currently in use. As soon as I
picked up, the tone would be replaced by a scrambled signal using the
3000 Hz as it's offset.
So if this was a real attempt to tap us, they would have the two lines
used to transport our audio hooked up to the in- and output of the
second circuit. They would have tapped themselves.
If you publish a hacker magazine, the notion that at least some of
your phones are tapped some of time is not that far-fetched. Why do it
so obvious? This could be an illegal tap. It could be one done by and
for the PTT itself (they are the main subject of our publication after
all).  It could be ...
Why guess. I'm not paranoid, and I don't want to be. If they tap my
lines that is fine. Everything we say over the phone is considered
public anyway. If they pay me, I'll transcribe all the important calls
myself. Our network, used to spread information to and from the
computer underground was down for two days. Now THAT PISSES ME OFF!

There is a *considerable* difference between kiddy hackers breaking
game protection, and breaking a cryptographically secure protocol.
What the kiddy hackers do is try to unravel layers of security through
obscurity.  With the kind of problem we're talking about, all the code
is actually released into the public domain, available for inspection.
The security resides in things like the difficulty of inverting complex
1:1 hash functions which were modified by a secret key, or of factoring
the products of large primes, which has been shown to be beyond our
best mathematicians, and these spotty little kids *ain't* our best
mathematicians, by a long chalk.

force bad sectors in exactly the right places...  I tell you though,
that sort of stuff is trivial compared to factoring the product of

It's just one of those hormone things that you give up when you discover

up his skills after the age of 21 was Jeremy 'Jez' San, and he just did
it because he was working for Acorn on copy-protection schemes as a paid
job, which isn't the same thing at all.  Mostly they're around 18, plus
or minus.  A lot of the kids I knew who used to do this (back when I had
to keep up with the technology) were in high-school.  One of the best I

Sure, but what's that got to do with cracking crypto?  If you can't see
the difference between STO protection schemes and mathematically hard
algorithms, ...
Don't let your hero-worship blind you to reality.  No amount of skill
in disassembling or knowing the CRC tricks of a 1771FDC, or the six different
versions of an 8251, is going to help in breaking a secure crypto scheme
or something derived from one, like a secure e-cash scheme.  It's a
*completely* different set of problems.
(Oh - on disassembling - one of the tricks we used to get round the stuff
that was used to stop debuggers being able to place breakpoints was to
run in a completely simulated machine.  The program *could not tell*
that it wasn't running live on real hardware.  We'd do this stuff right
down to the level of scheduling the data arriving off the disks - some
schemes would do sneaky stuff like have the cpu execute a long stream
of INC instructions, and get hit by an int when the data arrived, and
use the value of the incremented register to check that the data had
arrived at *exactly* the right time conforming to the sneaky way it had
been written to disk.)
Acorn's R&D division knew what they were doing in the protection area
despite some laughable protection on the games side by Jez and the boys
from Acornsoft - we actually did a design review and costed out the
expense of doing our own DES chips for a dongle.  Fortunately we never
went down that route... (I'm not a fan of dongles as a substitute for
proper licensing arrangements)  We also came pretty close to putting
serial numbers in our CPUs, on-chip.  We decided against it in the end
for the same reasons we decided against dongles... it just caused *way*
too much customer ill-feeling. (For instance, if your CPU died and had
to be replaced, suddenly your mission-critical CAD package would stop
PS It's because we looked into doing our own DES chips in quite some
detail that I've always taken it for granted that Wiener's cracking
engine was not only possible but probably existed.  By our own back
of the envelope calculations in the early 80's, these machines were
feasible then.

By the way, the reason I've never discussed the ecash threads on this
group is because it was obvious right from the start that double-spending
makes the schemes unworkable, and that only a central reference authority
could patch the system to make it work, which (in my seldom humble opinion)
entirely negates the point of these schemes.
My suspicion is that anonymous ecash can only be made to work if giving
the tokens to someone else is a destructive operation - the way core
memory (I'm probably one of the few people on this group who've had to
worry about stuff like this :-) ) used to be erased when read.
Except that these days, the destructive read would have to be something
secured by the laws of physics, like say a quantum state being trashed
by virtue of being observed.  (The way secure quantum comms works - if
we had something akin to a quantum delay line in a card, maybe that
would work.)
However, the technology to do that sort of stuff is probably centuries off.

No, that's a totally separate problem.  What I'm worried about is
some comedian publishing a public key for addresses like
"alt.security.pgp at cs.utexas.edu" or any of the common mailing
gateways, and suddenly people using auto-encrypting mail programs
find that no-one can read their posts.
It kind of throws a spanner in the works for completely transparent

:I do see a signature for that key from Miron Cuperman. Perhaps

That's not the point; someday soon people will be using mailers
that auto-pgp without them even realising it.  I don't want to
have to hassle those people with interactive questions about whether
they trust someone, or force them to maintain personal lists of
bad addresses.
Whatever solution we can find will have to involve active support
from the keyservers I suspect.  thoth at netcom - I hope you're
listening to this!  There's a definite problem of a denial-of-service
attack here that the current scheme makes hard to avoid.  Hence why
I called it 'namespace pollution' in the subject line.

So?  It has to be done *sometime* by someone.  The point I was making
was that for pgp (or any equivalent cyphered mail system) to work *en
masse*, it has to be completely automatic and idiot-proof.  I'm not
talking about *us* here, I'm talking about your old mother, or Mac
users, or the company technophobic managing director etc.  What I see
as desirable for such people is that their mail is encrypted whenever
possible, but they don't have to do anything to make it happen.  This
means that the current web of trust scheme is not an applicable model,
because these people have defined *no* trusted paths at all.
We need some relatively trustworthy mechanism for getting pgp keys
that will foil a denial-of-service attack - either the one I suggested
where someone sets up a key for a mailing list or mail2news gateway
(either maliciously or accidentally as with our friend Paulie-Anna)
- or where someone creates a key for a specific person (as one joker
did for Sternlight last year (this was a second one; Sternlight had
one of his own first which he never revoked before he deleted his
private key...)) which means that person won't be able to receive
mail - if auto-pgp mechanisms become common.
To me it looks like this has to be done by heavy-handed control
coming from the keyserver admins, though I'd prefer that there
was a more democratic way.  Please suggest anything you think is
For the moment, I think that an auto-pgp mechanism will have to
use a relatively secure server like SLED that can't have arbitrary
keys added to it by all and sundry.  If this is sufficiently
different to the current key server mechanism that Eric doesn't
object, then fine :-)  Actually, the mechanism I forsee for doing
this sort of thing is the tcp/ip interface to a keyserver that
Ben Cox suggested last november.  It *could* be bolted on to the
finger server at wasabi, but I think the whole concept needs us
to stand back a bit and think of what we really want before we
start hacking.
One mechanism that crossed my mind - when a new key is added, the
keyserver that gets it first might hold on to the new key until
after it had mailed the key owner and requested confirmation.  This
ought to be possible to automate.  This would also block the cases
where someone bulk uploads their keyring with keys on it which
they'd been given in confidence, by people who didn't want their
employers or government to know they were using pgp...

No no, you missed the point!  2.5 will be made *public*!  It's not

Of course.

: I ask the operators of the remaining servers to remove the MIT server

: keys generated by any "non-conforming" software in their own operations.
I don't think they'll listen.  They understand the politics better
than you do.
: I ask users of PGP not to add future keys to the offending server.
Why?  Add it to any one and it'll end up there.
: I call on cypherpunks to estlablish less formal key servers and develop : more stealthy and secure methods of key distribution.
Now you're just talking crap.
Uni, hush now, shut up, and listen.  You've entirely missed the point here.
This is a major tactical strike for pgp.  We finally have an entirely
legal pgp, thanks to some excellent net.politics from the guys at MIT.
The restriction on what new keys they accept was part of the deal, but
stop and think what it really means - is it going to affect *anybody*?
And what's to stop you fetching 2.5 and loading/re-dumping your old
key from that version?
This is *good news*, and we don't need any half-cocked wallies spreading
FUD over what is the best thing to happen to pgp ever.

You misunderstand what the RSAREF stuff does - it isn't an alternative
encryption - it's being used to replace the extended precision etc stuff
in pgp to make a 100% compatible version.  So the current pgp *is*
already 100% compatible, as long as its version number is >= 2.4 (which
by an amazing coincidence mines happens to be since I've had to
edit a couple of mission-critical comments since I got 2.3a ;-) )
Even if 2.5 checks version numbers or *any* internal details in the
pgp packets, as long as it is constrained by being compatible with
ViaCrypt 2.4, we can always *guarantee* to be able to make a compatible
free pgp based in 2.3a.
And since the RSA and IDEA patents aren't valid in Europe, this
is 100% kosher.  You guys use MIT-PGP and we'll use free pgp 2.5

As I said, you went belly-up on civil liberties right from the start;
that's why I never joined.  It damn well *should* be the remit of CU.
The more technology the government has at its disposal for control of
the people, the easier it becomes to exercise that control.  CU is the
only organisation in Britain that has the knowlege and expertise to
spot those signs of encroaching technology abuse, and do something
about it.
Let me spell it out for you.  Net.pornography, if it's a crime at all, is
a crime carried out depending on jurisdiction either by the supplier
(whoever posted the article) or the recipient - the person who displays
the file on a screen or printer.  The correct attitude for CU to take
should be to insist that all other persons in the transaction - network
providers, store-and-forward news hosts, the phone company, local BBS's
etc - should be in no way culpable for what goes through their hosts.
This argument should be extended to all 'data crimes' - copyright violation,
slander, passing stolen information, etc.
This is something that CU should be fighting for.  By turning a blind
eye to the initial salvoes from HMG which are specifically aimed at
pornography, you make it much harder for yourselves to construct a general
argument later, when the govt cracks down on the use of cryptography,
or articles posted in the US about the sex life of the royal family, or whistle-blowing articles about government surveillance or if they
decide section 28 applies to news spools on public university machines
and they ban soc.motss - where exactly does it stop once you let them start?
Think for yourself what sort of things happen on the net that scare
the govt shitless.  Do I have to spell it _all_ out for you?
And worse; it only takes *one* of these objections against completely free
speech on the net to make it onto the statute books, for HMG to be justified
in introducing draconian police-state measures such as automatic scanning
of networks and phone lines for 'illegal material'.  By the time that
framework is in place (more so than it is already I mean, if you know
anything about System X and Menwith Hill...) civil liberties in this
country will be a fond memory.
Not to mention putting impossible pressures on people like demon and
pipex to self-censor themselves, the way uknet used to and JIPS still
Remember, the govt has the gutter press on their side - they're incredibly
easily manipulated to splurge "UK UNIVERSITY SUPPLIES PORN TO 2_YR OLDS"
or whatever - and the Internet (never mind the kiddy BBS circuit) has
no-where near the popular level of awareness that it has in the US. Joe Public is *not* going to give a tinker's damn if we're clamped down on -
we're just some poncy rich techno elitists that he doesn't understand
and doesn't sympathise with in the slightest.  Why should he care that
we're up in arms because or networks are being scanned for porno pictures.
Especially if we don't seem to care much ourselves.
No no, not at all.  I'll be in the country for a few months more, but
I'll shortly be emigrating permanently to a country where automatic
surveillance the like of which GCHQ enjoys is still a gleam in the eye
of their security services, and where they at least have an explicit
constitution that can be used to defend liberty, despite it being a
hard fight and one that they don't always win.  In the UK we're not even
given the chance to fight.
By 'too late', I didn't mean too late for you to reply to my article,
but too late to do anything about the forthcoming crackdown on the
nets that I forsee coming within the next couple of years.  The Americans
have been going about it like a bull in a china shop with their panic
Clipper and FBI Wiretap proposals; the UK govt does things more low-key
and you won't even realise you've been screwed until after the appropriate
legislation has been quietly slipped through and they make some loudly
advertised arrests, carefully mentioning how the dastardly criminals were
caught by the use of high technology (ie making sure everyone knows it
can happen to *you*, and bullying you into giving up whatever it is you
were doing - just like the psychology behind TV detector vans...).  This
whole cryptography business and access to truly uncontrolled media has
the spooks and the govt worried, now that a few of the more astute of them
are actually starting to *understand* the power it gives to individuals.
Never before in the last decade have people been able to communicate their
thoughts completely privately, short of physically going to talk to someone.
The arrival of strong cryptography means that Big Aunty is no longer
omniscient; she's pissed off about it, and she *will* do someting about
it.  It's up to you guys to stop her.  You may think it's none of your
business and should be left to the 'freedom and liberty' brigade, but
its your freedom and your liberty on the networks that will be the first
to be lost.
Don't say you weren't warned.  I'll drop in from the States in 2000 and see how things are going, if uk.org.community is still allowed to exist
that is, and maybe we can all have a big laugh.  One way or another.

@_subject: quantum Computing 
It's purest bullshit: there are a class of mathematically difficult
problems called "NP-Complete".  These problems are all equivalent to
one another in difficulty, ie if you can solve one you can solve them
all (that's where the complete part comes is - it's NP-complete if
you can prove that equivalence to another NP-complete problem).
The "NP" part is "Non-deterministic, polynomial time".  What that means
is that there is a solution possible in polynomial time (rather than
exponential time) *ONLY* on a *NON-DETERMINISTIC* machine.  And that's
the fun part, because a non-deterministic machine is one that *guesses*
the correct path every time it has a choice to make.  It's like trying
to guess a 3-bit number, and saying "Is the first bit a 1?" Yes!  "Is the
second bit a 0?" Yes!  "Is the third bit a 0?"  Yes!
Clearly, in real life, this doesn't happen.  However, in fairy-tale land
(or quantum physics as it's called) such things *can* happen - because
one interpretation of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen thought experiment is
that every time you make a choice based on the outcome of a quantum
event, you fork off a pair of universes!  In one universe you make
one choice; in the other universe you made the other choice.  Consequently
if you loose a computer on such a problem, in *one* of the many many
universes it generates, it'll find the right answer in polynomial time.
The basis of quantum computing as a means to crack NP-complete problems
therefore reduces to finding which of these universes found the answer and
comminicating that answer to all the other universes.  (Of course, you
don't have to do this part, but the 99.9999999999999999999999999999999%
of experimenters in all the universes that didn't find the result are
not going to believe the method words too well...)
Basically, it's a theoretical result with no application in the real
world, and if ever anything happens that makes it mappable to the
real world we'll have been subjected to such a major upheaval in
the way the universe works that no-one will give a damn any more
about such trivial things as encryption because we'll all effectively
have turned into magicians :-)

Excuse me folks - I think we're missing a big point here:  there's no
such crime as 'conspiracy to infringe' nor is it a civil offense.  What
PKP are talking about is agrravated damages - *if* you are *breaking* one
of their patents, eg by *running* pgp, then because you are encouraging
others to do so by, say, also offering a keyserver service, they can
ask for larger damages because they'll say you're *flagrantly* violating
their patent and encouraging others to do so.
However, if you're *not* violating their patent, there's nothing they can
do about the 'encouraging others to do so' part.  Running a keyserver,
as long as it doesn't run pgp to do its key management, is not infringing
PKP's patents, and they can't do anything about it - it's a question
of publishing and free speech.  It's not even the more restricted
commercial speech - keyservers aren't a business.
I think if you read the MIT announcements closely you'll see what they
say is compatible with this view.

I think it was an excellent opportunity to cull the dead wood.  How about
instead of resubbing all 500+, you just send them all a mail telling them
what happened and how to resub.  That way we only get the interested ones

: He most likely used a chain of remailers.  That's the REASON for
: the last seven lines (instead of a simple anonXXXX-type address.
: When you send those 7 lines to the soda remailer, it decrypts it

When this feature was put in recently, in response to a suggestion of
mine (which I now regret because of...), I intended for each posting
to be encrypted with a different randomly-generated key, and for the
key to be deleted after being reused on reply.  Unfortunately Eric
chose not to implement it that way, and although he promised to cycle
the keys periodically, he seems not to have done so.  I agree with whoever
it was above that was in fear of the key being compromised - it *is* a
possibility, and that's why I wouldn't use that remailer, if I ever had
to use a remailer.

Heh, smart aleck!  Since no-one seemed to be interested, I didn't
bother looking closely at the 90K of logs that Larry Wall's clip program
generates every day when you've got a big pattern file, *and* as luck would
have it, the damn program started breaking the very day after I posted that
so I could have missed it anyway.  And now my wife is visiting me for a couple of weeks holiday so I'm afraid I don't have time at the moment
for net.fun.
Actually I'm slowly rewriting the clip program in C with more
powerful functionality so it can be used to extract multiple threads
and file them separately - currently it all goes into one big file,
for all patterns - either that or you run multiple processes, and they're
expensive.  When I get a more robust and useful system going I'll
mention it here and maybe we can try the experiment again.  Also if
it works well, I hope to make the service available to others under
a magic-money kind of scheme.

Actually I was speaking to lile recently and she said that she was
removed from the list *after* resubscribing successfully after
the mass removal.  Something funny is going on.  Anyway, if she wasn't
taken off by eric, maybe you could resub her?  I think she's sloped
off in a huff assuming she was thrown out deliberately :-(

Of course, no-one has considered the possibility that the tmp at netcom persona
was manufactured and played out over time solely in order to boost the
credibility of the 'uni' persona :-)  [does anyone have any proof that
*either* of these people exist in real life or that all this flurry of
pseudo-legal action ever took place???]

Xenon always was careless about that sort of stuff :-)  I dunno why he
bothers with anonymous remailers though, all those rants recently about
people sitting on the source of MacPGP were *obviously* from Xenon - he
doesn't even attempt to disguise his writing style...
PS I suggested it half in fun a couple of weeks back, but I'm now
nearly certain that uni == tmp ...  I'm also starting to suffer this
really weird paranoid delusion that uni and tmp are both t.c.may -
it would explain why tc never has time to post much, he's too busy
being detweiler ;-)
PPS While in paranoid mode, I thought I'd mention that I've noticed
some of Detweiler's mannerisms emanating from email in New Delhi of
all places.  Weird.  I think I must be cracking up.
