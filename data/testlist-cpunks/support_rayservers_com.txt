All laptop users need privacy and computer security. Rayservers now
meets both needs with a simple out-of-the-box solution.
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Military-Grade Laptop Security for All
Panama City, Panama (PRWEB) March 1, 2007 -- Today, Rayservers
introduced the next advance in gold.rayservers.com/laptops [computer
security, its Secure-Out-of-the-Box laptop computers. These laptops
offer 100% encrypted hard drives and gold.rayservers.com/laptops
[privacy protected internet access for safe communications.
Unlike ordinary laptops, Rayservers laptops offer unparalleled privacy
and computer security. Rayservers' computers protect users from identity
thieves, corporate spies, data vandals, extortionists and much, much worse.
Who Needs Computer Security?
Anyone can have their ordinary insecure laptop invaded from the Internet
or physically stolen. The media is full of stories about high government
officials and corporate executives who have lost their -- and OUR --
personal data when their unencrypted laptops were stolen. Even the FBI
lost 160 laptops last year.
Professionals, especially, need to take computer security seriously.
Lawyers have to preserve privileged client communications. Human rights
activists need to protect contacts living under repressive regimes.
Journalists must protect their sources and work-product. Everyone has
need for more privacy than ordinary laptops can provide.
Secure-Out-of-the-Box laptops from Rayservers are the long-needed solution.
"Companies face huge liabilities when they use insecure laptops," said
Sandy Sandfort, CEO of Rayservers. "In the UK, the Nationwide Building
Society was fined  because of a laptop that was stolen from an
employee. At Rayservers we offer security consulting, migration training
and support to help companies better comply with Sarbanes Oxley, privacy
legislation such as HIPAA and the California Privacy Act."

If you are after strong security, you want to ensure, at a minimum,
encrypted swap and /tmp as well. After all, it is unlikely the
mathematics will be broken by any adversary you are likely to
encounter... but such an adversary will likely be able to read clear
text on disk that the consumer did not know existed...
With a 100% encrypted disk, operating system logs, temp and swap files,
etc are not possible avenues for information leakage to a potential
Many people use the free Truecrypt program which implements decent
crypto, but then they use insecure Windows which has full access to the
decrypted contents while they are in use... any resident malware can
then snarf the information and send it away... the text editor and
cleartext in memory could be sent to virtual memory or written to
Windows temp files, etc.
The loop-aes readme describes how to implement encrypted root for those
of you who want to do this yourself (and we encourage you to). The cost
of the time you will spend putting all the pieces of the puzzle together
is likely to exceed the premium you would pay us for a secured notebook.
Additionally we offer VPN services that secure your network access as
well as secure-out-of-the-box email hosted with SSL mail servers and
OpenPGP email where the key is under your control (i.e. security that
locks out the email provider). Your local ISP will have no way to
determine your surfing habits.
We are aware of the cheap VIA notebooks - if any organization wants to
order 20 or more based on that hardware we will add it to our line. We
are always happy to do custom notebooks based on the your favorite
hardware or even your existing notebook.
Best regards,

Seconded. Post instructions on a setup and it will be running on a debian
vserver guest.
An additional mixmaster/tor middleman node is planned as well.

Perhaps Ms. Caproni needs to read the 11th Amendment. "The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity,...
...commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State."
Where are your Courts of Law, Ms. Caproni? You are committing a fraud upon the American people, a fraud via public speech, using intimidation from a public, corporate, office.

Hello David,
"Today, we do not have money or stock markets. We have debt tokens, slave
identification cards, money markets instead of stock markets, and fascists in
charge. In a related note, we do not have news, we have propaganda. This is
because we do not have a market for news, we have a market for advertising. News
merely turns into filler in-between the paid advertising spots. Naturally
parasites arise to replace news with propaganda."
So, hell no, religious idealism won't cut it. You need a market.

Traceability has to exist because there is no money in circulation.
Seen this?:
Basically everywhere that your attorney would never look ;).
The GSF documents are a start. There is more in the pipeline. You need to learn
Common Law, how to do a Claim of Right, etc.
FYI, such a /Claim of Right/ is far advanced.
Lessons on Common Law:  - how it works is basically how a real
Court of Record works:
At a minimum read every essay here:
At a minimum listen to this:
Then go back and read all the GSF documents and claim of right:
This for bonus points (latest developments):
Basic quiz after all that:
1. What is the difference between money and currency?
2. What is the difference between one of the People of America and a US Citizen?
3. Is the President (the current one, and, say, the last dozen) of the United
States an American?
4. What is a Court of Record?
5. What kind of court is a US Federal or State Court or UK equivalent?
6. What is on deposit at a US or UK retail bank?
7. Who /can claim/ to *represent* the people?
8. Define the territory of the United States.
9. What *is* the United States and/or the United Kingdom?
10. What is the /law of the land/ and who can claim to enforce it?
The GSF System allows for multiple, independent issuers. The idea is, to start
an economy, not a monopoly. See claim of right.
p.s. Feel free to forward a copy to anyone you *know* (do not spam), including
but not limited to: Judge Advocate General of US Navy, US Coast Guard, US
Supreme Court Justices, World Court, the President of the United States, Prime
Minister of UK, US & UK Army Provost Marshal, FBI, CIA, MI5, MI6, House of
Commons, US Congress, House of Lords, US Senate, US Fed Res, BoE, SEC, FSA,
Interpol and similar in other countries. Any such high powered recipient can
then forward his or her response to the quiz to us or one of the lists.
Responses will be published, gag orders *notwithstanding*. If you wish to write,

Oh, lets get you started. Go on, you already have:
I see.
My question, Steve, is how does "1 dollar" come into existence?
Lets make that three questions. How does 1 dollar in your bank account get there
and how does a 1 dollar Federal Reserve Note come into existence. Are they one
and the same?
Anything else you wish to add regarding a gold standard, I'm all ears.
