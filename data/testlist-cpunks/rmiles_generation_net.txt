I don't quite understand the logic behind this. The fact that the
program's source is available is itself a proof that there are no
backdoors. Anyone can read the source code and make sure it's OK.
However, this argument does hold against non-OSS. It can even be used to
promote Linux (and other free open-source operating systems), since
someone could distribute some win32 trojans on download.com, tucows.com
and others.

@_subject: GPL & commercial software, the critical distinction (fwd) 
Which BSD are you talking about? From my personal and professional
experience, OpenBSD, NetBSD and FreeBSD proved to be just as stable (and
OpenBSD even more stable and reliable) than Linux. All three of them are
open-source. The OpenBSD project emphasizes the importance of security and
cryptography, and since it ships from Canada there are few export
restrictions. Take a look at  for more info.
I hope you meant BSD/OS when you mentioned BSD :-)
