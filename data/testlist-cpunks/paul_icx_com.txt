Now, hold on here.  I was at the meeting and I don't know what you are referring to as "highly unethical behavior", could you expand this for myself and others.
As for "FOR:  I've received commentary which suggests that they believe that
key-signing somehow vouches for the HONESTY of the person involved; not his
IDENTITY."  Unless I'm in the minority, the key-signing process IS NOT a test to determine if the person is a 'honest' person, but to ensure that the keys where valid and that someone did not make a mistake somewhere.
Keep in mind that the meeting was a mixer, not a board of directors meeting - take a chill pill.
