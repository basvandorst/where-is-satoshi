Do spaces (ASCII 20) in passwords make them less secure?
I was speaking with a security admin who feels that spaces decrease the effectiveness of I thought that they would actually do the opposite & increase password efficacy, as most password dictionary attacks do not attempt to attack embedded spaces. An attack trying to penetrate embedded spaces would seem to make the dictionary orders or magnitude larger.
Any comments?

Try running the C2config.exe found in the 3.51 resource kit, Should NT detect that you have network connectivity during the C2 test, you will get the following error message: "C2 compliance requires that no networking software be installed on your system.  One or more network services have been detected on your system.  Select OK to use the Network Control Panel Applet to remove these services.   If you click on Help, you will get the following bit of information: Windows NT networking services were not included in the NCSC C2 evaluated configuration.  For your system to conform to the evaluated C2 configuration, the network services must be removed or disabled.  Should you click on OK, if you are on a NT workstation, you have just disconnect yourself from the network.  If you ran the test on a server, you have just shut down your network.
