Microsoft Announces Visual J++ 6.0 Technology Preview
We wanted you to be one of the first to know
about the launch of Visual J++ 6.0 Technology Preview.
Microsoft Visual J++ 6.0 is the fastest way to harness the productivity
of Java language and the power of Windows to build and deploy
high-performance, data-driven client and server solutions.  Two-way
visual design tools combined with the Windows Foundation Classes (WFC)
for Java, advanced cross-language and remote debugging capabilities,
scalable data access, and one-button application deployment simplify the
development of feature rich Windows and Web applications, components,
and middle-tier business objects.
