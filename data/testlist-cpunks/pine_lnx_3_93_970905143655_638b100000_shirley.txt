implies someone choosing what algorithm to be the standard.  Better is publicly known formats and algorithms, so that the strengths of the
algorithms can be tested, and multiple products can implement the same formats and algorithms, and compete on the basis of features and
usability, rather than FUD-based claims of security.  This may result
in multiple formats and algorithms being used, and that's all for the
best, so that when one algorithm is compromised, others are available
to be switched to.
