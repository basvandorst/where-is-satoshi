@_subject: Improvement of remailer security 
No, it was done using port 25.
However, it would be a good idea to block whitehouse.gov for any of you
who run remailers.
Appearantly, this wasn't the first time it's happened, but it is the
highest profile case.  According to several people here, someone at CMU
pulled a similar stunt last year.  He didn't get arrested, but the SS
had a nice long chat with him.  Appearantly the SS investigates dozens
of such prank mails every year...
