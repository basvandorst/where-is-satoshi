I second that, it is strange how easily it is to bait supposedly libertarian list members into saying statist things about "consumer protection laws" and other such examples of state force and coercion over businesses. I do not go out, but a piece of software, then "demand" that I am given the source code and an explanation of why each line was written in the particular way it appears, of course this is all an aside to the real point that people should know better than to try to "protect" children from speech they don`t like.

Yes, it will be a great sight indeed to see Iraqi freedom-fighters bombing the hell out of soft targets in America, Britain, Australia and any other imperialist countries who like to consider themselves among the world police. The same is true in the UK, a few days ago I saw a television interview (I rarely watch such rubbish but I sometimes like to laugh at the spin, but it also depresses me that most citizen-units swallow this crap) with some government minister who said that "We can attack strategic points along the production line without releasing any chemical agents", another lie. It is also a commonly held public misconception that there is such a thing as a "precision bombing campaign" (government spindoctor term) which most people believe implies a campaign where no-one is injured but we miraculously win a war without any casualties.  The more American, British, Australian, French etc. troops that die in the Gulf War II (tm), the more the western world will realise that war involves losses and that we cannot go on policing the world.
