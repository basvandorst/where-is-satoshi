Introducing...."FLOODGATE BULK EMAIL LOADER"         AND...."GOLDRUSH STEALTH MASS MAILER"
I operate a custom email service. From my experience, your typical bulk email service just collects email addresses from any source they can rely on shear volume emailing to produce the desired results - the "shotgun" approach. I have found that by targeting emails to groups that would likely be specifically interested in your product, the response rate is much better than when using the "shotgun" approach AND you don't tend to annoy as many people (which is nice for both sides). By targeting emails, I mean that I collect the addresses myself from on-line areas (forums, newsgroups, etc.) so that I mail to people that are likely to be interested in my products based on their on-line participation.
FLOODGATE is the renegade technology that helps me do this.
This is the same software that all bulk emailing services use!
