@_subject: contemplating remailer postage 
How about this: Issue numbered stamps sequentially.  Encrypt them and add a
cryptographic checksum to each stamp.  You then create a database such
that one bit of data corresponds to one stamp.  With a mere 64K
database, you could issue and keep track of 524288 postage stamps.  That
ought to last you a few years.  (At 100 letters a day, it would last
over 14 years.  Most cypherpunk remailers get considerably less than 100
emails a day.)
