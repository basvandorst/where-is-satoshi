@_subject: current status of cypherpunks, tim may, etc. ?? 
I wasn't paying attention when the lne node went away,
and was a bit lost in my CP mailing list subscription
for a few months...
I subscribed to minder, but it was a _joke_ in terms
of spam and bounces and all sorts of lameness in my
cypherpunks folder _and_ my inbox.  Further, I noticed
I was no longer seeing any posts by Tim May - I might
have been missing others as well, but he was
conspicuously absent.
So, I have unsubbed from minder and subbed to
al-qeada.net - hopefully they will be closer to LNEs
level of anti-spam excellence ... questions:
1. any comments on this level of spam and bounces,
etc., I saw from minder - does al-qeada use a more
LNE-like processor ?
2. Was tim may being filtered from minder, or is he
just gone now ?

That's the other question I had ... I keep hearing
about alt.cypherpunks, but there is nothing there -
regardless of whether I look through google groups or
other news2web or news2mail translations,
alt.cypherpunks is totally dead - maybe 1-2 posts per
month, and most of them test posts or garbage, and
this goes back at least for the last year...
Is there some secret or alternate news feed that has
the real list, or is alt.cyperpunks just dead ?

@_subject: other mailing list recommendations ? 
Can anyone recommend any other mailing lists besides
cypherpunks to lurk on / read ?
The aspects of cypherpunks that I value are the strong
and opinionated stances on civil liberty issues, the
pro gun and preparedness stances, and the general tech
slant ... any suggestions ?

@_subject: the inevitability of a new york nuke ? 
Article on the front page of the NYT today (Aug 30,
2006) discusses the proposed sale of a large block of
apartment buildings owned by Met Life in downtown
manhattan.  It will be a huge sale, 5 billion or more.
The article goes on to discuss the likelihood of the
units being gentrified, turned into luxury condos, and
the plight of the cities working middle class who will
be forced out, etc.
But what caught my eye is that not only is Met Life
selling off this crown jewel of urban real estate, but
"Last year the insurer sold its landmark tower at 1
madison avenue and the skyscraper at 200 Park Avenue,
the former Pan Am building, for more than 2.6 billion"
It further details that Met Life is assuredly _not_
getting out of the real estate market, and in fact has
over 40 billion of real assets worldwide.
So ... who has better research, intelligence,
predictive models and risk assessment than a giant
insurance company ?
And now that giant insurance company is going _very
short_ manhattan real estate ?  Including its own
landmark, historic headquarter building ?
Is it possible that some have decided that a NYC nuke
is a question of when and not if ?

@_subject: Possible to verify NK launch ?  Is any communication possible ? 
TV says NK has launched some missiles.
If I am not in the Sea of Japan, or in NK, etc., how
could I possibly verify that this is true, given the
near blackout of information into and out of NK ?
I don't want (at least not in this thread) to discuss
the possibility that it did not occur, but I _do_ want
to discuss the short term and long term mechanisms by
which I could decide whether it occurred.  Public
radar ?  Weather radar ?  Some tourist on a boat ?  Is
there any reason to expect that at some point I could
make an informed decision about this ?
My second question is, does anyone talk to anyone in
NK ?  Do they have mail ?  Do they have phones ?  If I
want to talk to someone (anyone) in NK, how would I go
about this ?  Is it completely impossible ?

@_subject: ISPs providing "warrant canaries" 
Someone wrote here in the recent past about libraries
bypassing secret warrants by updating their boards
every X days/months with a "nobody has served us a
secret warrant" type message.
I am using a new offsite storage vendor, rsync.net,
which publishes what they call a "warrant canary":
Which I found interesting.
Is this what they have been called, or did they make
up the term "warrant canary" ?
How large of a grain of salt should I take this with ?
 It seems (and always did when I read of the libraries
doing it) like a reasonable idea, and their
implementation (signing the message, including a
non-forgeable date stamp) is thoughtful.
It's an interesting time we live in ...

Well, no it's not useful in _avoiding_ the warrant,
but nothing really is.  It seems useful in defeating
the secrecy of the warrant.  I'd rather know than not
know, all else being equal ...
This is less of an ISP and more of a "filesystem in
the sky" ... an offsite filesystem.  I encrypt all of
the data I send there, so it's not an issue, but it is
an issue to know when things like this happen, and I
like their stance.

Yes, that's right.  Unlike Iron Mountain and the other
commercial offsite data storage providers, rsync.net
is open to the entire SSH suite.
So what I do is mount my offsite filesystem over
sshfs, so i can use it as a local filesystem, and then
create a FreeBSD GBDE image on it, which I then also
So it is a remote encrypted filesystem over ssh.  If
my data is ever seized or a search warrant is ever
served, all they will see is a 4 gigabyte file of
random bits.
So in the end, the "warrant canary" doesn't concern me
much practically, because I don't really care if
rsync.net gets served ... it's still nice to see

@_subject: cracking DES in 2007 ?  Followup question RE: digital cable 
First question:
How fast can I crack DES using a single processor,
modern, commodity Pentium processor, circa 2007 ?
Any comments on speeding it up using a GPU ?
Can it be done in real time ?  Are we talking four
quad-cores CPUs or 40 quad-core CPUs (to do real
Second question:
How relevant are the questions (and their answers)
above to this:
This is the standard used to encrypt digital
television as they travel from the cable company to
the customers set top box.  From what I understand,
the standard is NOT triple-DES, but just normal DES.
Is there anything about what is being used here that
would make it not related to, or not applicable to,
the method and expense of cracking "DES" as discussed
Any comments about any of this are appreciated.
