To quote from the Welcome to Cypherpunks posting:
Can we stop feeding the animals? I'm tired of getting 20 to 30 postings
about Detweiler. I'm new to this interesting and high volume list, but its
interest is reduced by the flame war. I hope I haven't offended anyone, but
lets talk issues and technology and raise the SNR.

You'd still have only a countable number of states and the
cardiality of [0..1] is not countable.  I think that a simple
diagonalization argument would show that one would need an uncountable
number of infinite turing machines to represent a continum of states.
