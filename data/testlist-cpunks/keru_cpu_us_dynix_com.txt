@_subject: Skipjack proposed Thursday? 
I apologize for the ignorance, but I'm new here!  I keep reading about
Skipjack; can someone tell me what it is?  Is there a question-and-answer
file or something of that sort for the list that can educate me and bring
me up to speed on what everyone is talking about?

@_subject: "Village Voice" Article is Another Winner! 
Can anyone tell me how to get a copy of Levy's "Wired" article?  I have sent
several messages to the editors, with no response.  Kelly's Whole Earth
Review articles sounds like it might be of interest, too.

@_subject: Cypherpunks write code 
Can someone tell me if there is an FAQ available, and if so, how I can get
it?  I'm having a hard time getting up to speed so I can follow the
discussion threads here.

@_subject: getting wired #2 
The title is "Crypto Rebels."  It was published in the May/June issue of
WIRED, page 54.  See my reply to L. Detweiler for information on the
response I got back from them.

I heard you were asking about online versions of Levy's WIRED article. I'm
the editor of WIRED. It's available in an e-text version in the WIRED
folder on American Online, but not elsewhere at the moment. In a few months
WIREDs' gopher site will be up.
My own article in WER is not yet ready for ftp world. I'm finishing a book
of which that is one chapter, and I need to focus on that before geting
stuff up on the net.

@_subject: ANONYMOUS CONTACT SERVICE 
I received a message from System Daemon telling me that I had sent a
message using the anonymous contact service, allocating a code name, and
explaining how I can be reached anonymously.
What does this mean?  Sounds great, but I have no idea how I managed to
send such a message!

@_subject: Pine 
R. Tait wrote the following:
Which prompts me to ask:
Is anyone out there using the Pine email software?  If so, do you know of
any way to integrate PGP into Pine?  If not, any other ideas?  I see a lot
of signed messages out there, but the only way for me to send one is to
shell out to AIX, use vi to create a message, run pgp to create the signed
message, then run Pine and read the message in, at which point I can
finally send it.
Notice that this message isn't signed.  It's just too much hassle!
Thanks for any advice anyone can give me.
