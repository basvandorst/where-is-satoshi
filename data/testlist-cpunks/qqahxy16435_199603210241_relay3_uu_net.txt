I have  been working for some time on a project that involves doing proactive file authorization/authentication under Windows NT.  In the process, I've been working on an extension to the Kernel layer of the operating system because we need to be able to catch read/writes to the disk.  (All perfectly legal according to the DDK, just ot documented worth a damn.)  All of this is designed to work directly with the functionality given to us by the NT-Security layer.
Basically, I'm now questioning the C2 rating of Windows NT.  The entire security layer is  modular to the Kernel.  As a modular driver, it can be removed, rewritten, and replaced.   So, what makes it secure?  What gives it the C2 Rating?  How would one go about getting a C2 rating?
