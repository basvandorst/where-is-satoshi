Your comments naturally lead us to think how to make simple systems, yet functional enough for the purpose we are building them.
We are up to a revival in self-made purpose-specific web servers. Learning the few needed protocols and building from the ground up using open-source tools seems the way to go.
Notwithstanding hardware issues, using things out of intel and amd seems also to become a trend.
