I think the problem is not merely flooding the device with non-random
input data.  If you coordinate sucking out entropy with feeding in
non-random data you can suck the real entropy in the system down to zero
while making the driver think it has plenty of randomness.  While it's
not clear to me how this would lead to an attack, it would be worrisome.

This is a bug in your X server, not in netscape.  The X server should
never crash no matter what you send to it.
This doesn't crash my X server (SGI Irix 6.2), so it's probably specific
to XAccel.

It's absolutely okay for netscape to send long character strings to the
X server.  In fact, all it's probably doing is putting long character
strings into a Motif widget, which then sends them to the X server.
This is also totally okay.

Yes, it seems I misunderstood you.  There would have to be some binding
between the key of the merchant and some identifying information that
would allow the user to verify the merchant's identity.  This could take
the form of a True Name for the merchant and a trusted CA.  Another
approach would take the form of an FQDN, an IP address and a trusted CA.
In this case the software would have to verify that the FQDN and IP
address match the URL and DNS lookup, respectively.  Unfortunately, this
also requires that any time the IP address changes that the merchant get
a new certificate.  Also, the CA must be checked to verify that the
certificate hasn't been revoked, or you run the risk of an attacker
getting the old IP address.
Does anyone see any other options?

I agree.  Sending your cc# to a key or an IP address is not what you
want to do.  As a consumer, I want to make sure that I send my cc# to
the merchant I am buying from.

I'm certainly no expert on viruses, but doesn't that have to be
transitive flow of executable information?  If I'm just shipping data
around, there's no way you can infect me.  Does Java allow the client to
upload an applet to the server?  Can applets persist between netscape
sessions?  If the answer to both of these questions is no, then the
viability of viruses should be substantially degraded.

No, the drawback is that then all the readers of the newsgroup would
complain that this remailer was cluttering up the newsgroup with
unreadable garbage.  Twice.
Here's another modest proposal.  I note that once you've sent a message,
there appears to be no way for a recipient to reply without knowing who
the originator is.  A simple addition to the remailer protocol would be
to encrypt the message and the control information seperately.  This
would allow the sender of a message to provide a pre-packaged method for
returning a reply.  The recipient of the original message could then
just blindly send his reply to the starting point remailer specified in
the original message by tacking the pre-packaged routing information on
to the front of his message.

They can also be used only from the local machine on Windows or from any
machine your X server trusts on Unix.  Unless the attacker can control
what software is installed on the target system, there's no way for him
to use this to his advantage.  Of course, there's always the possibility
of exploting bugs, but that's not a "flawed algorithm".

@_subject: digital cash and identity disclosure 
The process of spending a coin is not simply that of transfering data.
There is a complicated protocol in which Alice decrypts some of the
identity information in the coin.  Let's say that Alice spends the coin
twice, once with Bob and again with Chuck.  Bob and Chuck can pool the
information they got from Alice and reconstruct her identity.  Alice
can't just give them both the same information because the receiver is
the one who determines what information is decrypted.  For a more
detailed explanation, check out Schneier's book.

@_subject: How can e-cash, even on-line cleared, protect payee identity? 
If Bob insists that the bank wouldn't redeem Alice's coin, that's not
Alice's fault.  The bank should have reserved the money when Alice
withdrew it.  Since nobody other than Bob sees the unblinded coin, it's
Bob's fault if somebody else spent it before Bob could.  In the case of
fraud by the bank, since the bank signed the coin, the bank should be
liable if it won't redeem it.
Perhaps the problem is that Bob insists that Alice's coin was not signed
by the bank.  In that case, how about this modification?  Alice should
first show Bob the doubly blinded coin she gave to the bank and the
signed doubly blinded coin she received back.  Bob can verify the
signature and then Alice can give him the blinding factor so he can
unblind it himself.  Bob also needs to sign the singly blinded coin that
he gives to Alice so that Alice can later show that she gave him the
correct blinding factor if Bob tries to claim that she didn't.
Are the any problems with this?

That's true.  You really want to make sure that the merchant you are
giving your money to is the one who has the goods you are interested in.
Perhaps the only way to solve this problem is with some sort of trusted
escrow agency.  The agency would be well known and its reputation could
be verified fairly easily.  Of course there's still the existential
problem of how do you know your connection to the rest of the world
isn't controlled by someone else, but there's really no solution to

@_subject: How can e-cash, even on-line cleared, protect payee identity? 
Good point.  To guard against this, Alice needs to double blind what she
sends to the bank.  She can then remove one layer of blinding and show
the results to Bob.  Of course Bob and the bank can still colude because
of the timing of the transactions.  This seems to be a fundamental
weakness of this reverse e-cash scheme.

I question the accuracy of this.  The fingerd bug was that a string in
the static data area was read in with gets which could be overflowed.
At some point in memory after this input buffer was the string constant
that stored the name of the finger command.  What the Morris work did
was to overflow the input buffer and replace the string constant
"finger" with "csh".  When fingerd then exec'ed the command, that gave
you a shell running on the machine.
While it is certainly true that you can stomp on memory in static
buffers, it's not clear that you can execute whatever code you insert
there.  If the buffer happens to be allocated off the stack (and the
stack grows down) then you can modify the return address.  Of course,
you have to know the address of whatever code you want to execute.  And
that code has to do something useful.  Presumably, if there are two
bugs, one which lets you write over a static buffer and one for a buffer
allocated from the stack, then you could execute code of your choosing.
Of course, that also assumes that you can execute from the data area
which is not always true.

Hmm, after having looked at the syslogd code, it looks like this

there sure are a hell of a lot of fixed size buffers being alocated off
