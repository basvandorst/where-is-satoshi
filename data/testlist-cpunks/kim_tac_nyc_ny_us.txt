Dear Cypherpunks,
I apologize for having gatewayed inappropriate messages to this
mailing list via my systems.  One of our new feeds for centralized
mailing list subscribal was leaking in messages from their USENET
feed.  I've asked them to fix this.
I have also taken steps to make sure no such misconfigured systems
can cause gatewaying through my system again.
