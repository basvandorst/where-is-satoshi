I'm interested in finding out what cryptographic tools, if any, are
available for the HP48 calculator.  I think someone mentioned that
they were developing a challenge authentication system using the HP48
to ameliorate the problem of sending cleartext passwords during telnet
sessions.  Is this project still being worked on?  Also, are there any
multiple-precision math libraries available for the 48?
Thanks for any information...

Of course electrons are quantum mechanical.  Ever hear of electron
diffraction?  Jonsson did Young's double-slit experiment with
electrons in 1961.  How about the scanning tunneling microscope?  In
an STM the electrons tunnel from one place to another, which is
clearly not a classical effect.  Maxwell's equations only describe the
electron classically, which is the whole reason why quantum
electrodynamics is required.  Maxwell's equations hold up with the
introduction of relativity, but not quantum mechanics.

Well, according to "An Introduction to the Theory of Numbers" by G.H.
Hardy and E.M. Wright you're correct.  They say the largest n for which
the Fermat prime F_n has been found is F_4 = 2^(2^4)+1 = 65537.  Of
course, this book was written in 1938 so the situation could have
changed since then.
F_n is known to be composite for
and others.  Not a very successful conjecture for Fermat, I suppose...
