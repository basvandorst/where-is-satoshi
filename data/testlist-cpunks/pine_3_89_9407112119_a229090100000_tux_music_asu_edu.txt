I already do this -- except that I use a keystroke- timing program for the true random source, and I do the mnomonic generation with my brain instead of the program.  My program just converts the random numbers to uniformly distributed printable ASCII (values between space and del), for a little more entropy than 6 bits per character.
A more automated way to generate a pass phrase might be to convert every 16 bits of random numbers to one of 65536 words and names in your favorite languages.  That way, you would have real words to memorize, but in a strange order.  For example, a 128 bit key might be:
tree elephant action roof xymurgy eight top slash.
You could try to think of some story to link the 8 originally unrelated words together and help you to remember it.
