While I'm certainly not saying "I don't buy it", how does this  reconcile with the reality of The Silk Road still being in existance.  One would think that governments would use these techniques against  the site if for nothing more than to catch/punish them for all the tax  evasion going on.
If this paper is true, the only reason I could think of why TSR is  still alive is because it is some kind of government front, though  there is no evidence of that at all.

While I'm American, I've been paying close attention to the Wikileaks  Party in Australia. Could it be the political embodiment of the  cypherpunk movement?
Regardless of what some think of Julian Assange, he certainly holds  true to the cp ethic and the parties belief in accountability,  privacy, and justice, seem well aligned with the movement.
So what do you think? Is their finally a political party more closely  aligned with the cypherpunk ideal than the Libertarians?

References: There's definately a chance it could become corrupt. But I think the  big difference between the Wikileaks Party and other, more traditional  parties, is that the WLP is focused on more than just grabbing power.  The whole organization is about speaking truth to power, destroying  secrets, informing the populace, and holding those in power  accountable. That a little different than most others.
Of course that could all be hyperbole just like Obama's promises of  change but we don't know yet.  While I agree that a cryptoanarchist  poses a bigger threat to the power structure than a political party  does, could this not be a good forward step?

The solution *could* be to host their own mail server if it were made
easy enough for them. I'm thinking something like a Raspberry Pi with
very well designed web UI for simple configuration and management.
Include a nice webmail client and even most non-techies could probably
do this.

I've looked into the Pirate Party but, at least from the American side
of things, they seem like a 'one hit wonder' who's nearly solely focused
on IP law reform. Perhaps this isn't the same in other places (I can't
imagine they would have won major elections with a single issue
platform) but here in the States, where they exist, it seems to be the case.

I completely support the idea of disloyalty oaths. The only problem I
see is that they simply wouldn't work. What we'd see is the government
putting increased threat of criminal prosecution on the corporate chain
and not enough corporate officers willing to risk going to jail in order
to do the right thing. Marissa Mayer from Yahoo said as much in her
Techcrunch interview last week.
The only option I see is that the public simply refuse to do business
with the offending companies and do business with their foreign
counterparts; take the money out of the US and do real harm to the US
economy in the process. When major companies start failing and everyone
knows it's because they betrayed their customers, the government will
have to respond. It's already starting to a degree. Microsoft and Google
have already said they're experiencing real financial loss because of
the NSA revelations.
We need to vote with our money. And we need to be willing to accept
'less viable' solutions for a time while other companies ramp up their
services. Are Americans willing to go that far? I'm not too sure. We
want comfort and convenience. Often, principles take a back seat to those.

Perhaps I'm being overly pessimistic but I can't imagine this kind of
thing happening on a routine basis. If anything, it looks like the
government is closing ranks and increasing the indoctrination of their
employees. I fear that we're going to see fewer and fewer people with
the courage of Edward Snowden as we move forward.
It's nice to think that conscience will win in the end but I honestly am
starting to see just the opposite. This is why I think we're going to
need groups like Anonymous and others who are willing to do straight
infiltration in order to find the truth. We can't rely on those who are
already in government to get a fit of conscience.

You're right, I did miss the point of your email. I get it now. Thanks

In a winner-take-all system like the US, third parties are irrelevant, except
insofar as they (like Bernie Sanders) caucus with one of the duopoly.
Birgitta Jonsdottir gets good press as a PP member of the Icelandic Parliament.
FOr what that's worth.
