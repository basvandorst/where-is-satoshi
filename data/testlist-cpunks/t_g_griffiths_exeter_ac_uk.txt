@_subject: Scientology war update 
Wired has a good article on how the war of words on alt.scientology.religion
has split over into dawn raids and hardware seizures:
If this is what can be achieved, think what can happen when the
government _really_ puts its back it suppression. Time to PGP every
file I own...

So a possible consequence of someone from Iraq being obnoxious on a
mailing list, to someone in the know, could be several PGP-encrypted
mails dumped in their inbox... A little extreme, for us gentles, but the
threat should be effective.
Of course, spamming every Iraqui email address you could find with encoded
mail could cause a _lot_ of trouble.

Yup, I don't disagree with that. But, I have trouble answering the
 obvious question, 'well, how many lives _does_ it take before something
 is done?'. Is there any way to quantify this kind of thing?  We hear on TV etc people saying "If this draconian measure saves the
 life of one innocent child its worth the loss of my right to walk in
 the park, or whatever". This is clearly shit, but can people suggest a
 sensible measure of when new legistlation is justified?

Does it? Or does it mean that we potentially have 49% of the population
in jail for any particular act, deemed to be a crime by the remaining 51%?

I was trying to start from somewhere more fundamental than the
 Constitution, but if I understand you, you're saying that an arbitary,  allbeit 'self-evident', set of limitations are set down (i.e. the US
 Constitution) at some point in time and no new laws should be made that
 contradict this set of rules.
 By doing this, aren't we putting a dictatorial limit on whatever
 democracy we come up with? In effect saying "we're all equal under God,
 and God wrote the Constitution"?                            No, this is the UK, we don't get rights here. Well, not quite true - for
example we do get the right to bear arms (1888 - can't recall the Act
offhand, but can find it). However, Her Maj. Gov reserves the right to tell
us exactly _which_ arms we can bear, which is why I've just handed my
beloved handguns in.
What we do get is more and more US-style laws being passed here, but
without the protection of a Constitution, e.g. looks like we'll get
Megan's Law shortly, but without a constitutionally-given right to privacy.

Except, of course, for the bit credited to you:
   Which means we should have the lowest number of incarcerated individuals
   instead of the most.
which was originally posted by you (or a spoof) in message
<199710310315.VAA2177 at einstein.ssz.com>, and later quoted by Mark
in his reply, which I responded to. I admit the aknowledgements weren't
too clear, a mixture of mine and Mark's editing.

and Jim Choate (for it is he) replied:
 But the bit I'm trying to get at. Doesn't the idea of what those rights
 are change from social group to social group? Furthermore, doesn't having
 a irrefutable set of laws place a fundamental (ist) limit on a  democracy that exists under them? Is it possible to have a true
 democracy without the assumption of a 'higher authority'?
 Of course there is the 'go along with it, or go somewhere else'
 arguement, but that's not much of a solution.
