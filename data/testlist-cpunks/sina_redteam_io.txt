For example, In Iran which is funny how its mentioned in slide 16, weak
encryption is common.  Most VPN providers sell PPTP with MSCHAP (thanks to
the built in windows client) which I think is as weak as the password set.
Three VPN logins are being emailed from providers to users in plain text.
It can't be too difficult for NSA or anyone analyzing the traffic to
decrypt the VPN content.

I'd say they are referring to some kind of protocol, network or application
For example, all connections to standard VPN ports.

I'm hoping to collect a good collection of cypherpunks material in time.
Suggestions are appreciated.
