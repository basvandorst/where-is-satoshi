Dear Friend:
AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV :
''Making over half million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your
home for an investment of only $25 U.S. Dollars expense one time''
THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET!
There is no catch. Just send your emails;
and you will be on your way to financial freedom!!
BE A MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!
Before you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the
letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity
of this letter on the internet, a national weekly news program
recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program
described below, to see if it really can make people money.
The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal.
Their findings proved once and for all that there are
''absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if
can follow the simple instructions, they are bound to make some mega
bucks with only $25 out of pocket cost''.
DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY &
RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY
WORKING BETTER THAN EVER.
This is what one had to say:
''Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was approached many
times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad I finally
joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort
money required. To my astonishment, I received total $ 610,470.00 in 21
weeks, with money still coming in''.
