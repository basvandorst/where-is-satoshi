Progress_ towards 1.9 continues.  This week saw the inclusion of the
following four "defect" tickets:
1384_: detect available space with storage/shares/ instead of storage/
1398_: make docs/performance.rst more precise
1441_: tahoe debug --help is wrong about running coverage on debian
1454_: remove misc/debian/
The development team `landed and closed`_ numerous tickets for 1.9.
Among these tickets are 1385_ (stop respecting pre-v1.3.0 config files)
and 1268_ (speed up large downloads by merging Share.loop() calls)
Hopefully beta1 for 1.9 will be coming out this week.

`puppet-tahoe`_ is the Free and Open Source Project of the Week.
FranC'ois Deppierraz's creation allows you to administer your Tahoe
installation through the use of Puppet_.  Using Puppet helps to ease
administrative changes, ensure various files exist and have the
appropriate permissions.
.. _`puppet-tahoe`: .. _Puppet: Joseph Ming and others discussed `protecting caps`_.  One interesting
quote from the discussion is   "Knowledge of the rootcap is both necessary and sufficient to retrieve
  your data." Tahoe Security Mantra [1_]
A discussion started into constructing the pubgrid_ so it could continue
to demonstrate Tahoe functionality without being abused.  Last week we
disabled the grid as the result of people abusing it, storing database
files, hacking tools, etc.  To this end, we reestablished the pubgrid
introducer, but not the gateway.  With the introducer, people can test
Tahoe by downloading, put in the furl of the introdcuer and thus access
the test grid.  Among the current suggestions are:
* extremely short lease expirations on all storage servers
* write size limits
* read size limits
* rate limit
The dev team provide Olaf a solution_ to his compilation issue on OS X.
The issue is the result of a problem with Nevow_.  Nevow needs to be
updated to fix the conflict, but the new version hasn't been released

Rather than single out any new patch, this week is dedicated to all the
new patches going into 1.9.  So headed on here_ and pick a patch to
review.  Currently there are 6 patches needing review for 1.9.  Let's
see if we can't halve that number by next week.  Awesome job by everyone
to reduce this number by 7 patches from last week.

Return of TWN
All, please accept my most humble apologies for the missing the last couple
of issues of TWN.  Unfortunately, illness, a dead hard drive, an earthquake
and a hurricane decided I had other, more pressing items.  Fortunately all
that is behind me and I will be able to churn out many more issues of TWN.
1.9 Status
A good deal has been happening since I was MIA regarding 1.9.  On the 25th of
August, Brian release the `alpha candidate`_ for 1.9.  Brian also presented a
`later update`_.  In this update, Brian covers:
* MDMF cleanup
* 1512_ - zero byte reads.  This is currently blocking beta1
* 1513_ and 1514_ - SDMF/MDMF operations
* buildslaves - memory footprint and speed testing
* documentation for 1.9 and MDMF

am I tied to my laptop or my desktop to use Tahoe.  I can use Tahoe
wherever my cell phone can carry me.  I am really looking forward to
running this on my Nook Color when I root it later this year.
Warning: you may be thinking that fdz's Android client is actually doing
encryption on your phone. Alas, no, it is delegating that to a
remote gateway running on a server.

through of a frontend proxy (i.e. nginx, Apache).  The patch creates a
blacklist file, with a list of storage-index strings and a reason for

effectively deal with DMCA complaints.

are the differences?"  So we created ticket 1427_ to answer this
question in FAQ.rst.
"Freenet is free software which lets you anonymously share files, browse
and publish "freesites" (web sites accessible only through Freenet) and
chat on forums, without fear of censorship. Freenet is decentralised to
make it less vulnerable to attack, and if used in "darknet" mode, where
users only connect to their friends, is very difficult to detect." [1_]

Brian Warner announced_ the 1.9 plan.  For a new feature to make into
1.9, it must have a ticket with a patch in the "Review-Needed" state by
24 July.  The developers will review and land said patches over the
following week, ending 31 July.

and review needed deadline is 31 July and the developers' review ends 7
The beta should be cut on 8 Aug with 3 weeks of testing to follow.  The
final release is scheduled for 31 Aug.
While MDMF will be the core of this release, Tahoe will not create them
by default.  Due to it being a compatibility impacting feature, the
development team plans to have the feature in a release or two before
enabling it by default.

The march towards Tahoe-LAFS v1.9 continues.  Brian posted an update of
`which tickets may make it into 1.9`_.  The ticket list is
*   : Medium Sized Distributed Mutable Files!
*  : David-Sarah's Dropbox-ish inotify-triggered auto-upload feature
*  : support blacklisting of files at a gateway
*  : use only 127.0.0.1 as a local address for anonymity
*  : rename tests of packaging
*  : stop respecting the pre-v1.3.0 config files
We unfortunately had to `shut down the pubgrid`_.  Various groups
took advantage of the open nature of the grid to store database
dumps, cracking tools and other items. The purpose of the pubgrid was
always to let people experiment with Tahoe-LAFS "live on the web"
without having to first download the software themselves. We're
talking on the mailing list about how to restablish a way for people
to do that which wouldn't be used to host problematic items.
Next week is the tenth issue of TWN.  Any suggestions on what we
should cover for our tenth issue?

The Free and Open Source Project of the Week is bup_.  The author of
bup, Avery Pennarun, details some exciting bits regarding bup.
  "bup has a few advantages over other backup software:
  It uses a rolling checksum algorithm (similar to rsync) to split
  large files into chunks. The most useful result of this is you can
  backup huge virtual machine (VM) disk images, databases, and XML
  files incrementally, even though they're typically all in one huge
  file, and not use tons of disk space for multiple versions.
  It uses the packfile format from git (the open source version control
  system), so you can access the stored data even if you don't like
  bup's user interface.
  Unlike git, it writes packfiles directly (instead of having a
  separate garbage collection / repacking stage) so it's fast even with
  gratuitously huge amounts of data. bup's improved index formats also
  allow you to track far more filenames than git (millions) and keep
  track of far more objects (hundreds or thousands of gigabytes).
  Data is "automagically" shared between incremental backups without
  having to know which backup is based on which other one - even if the
  backups are made from two different computers that don't even know
  about each other. You just tell bup to back stuff up, and it saves
  only the minimum amount of data needed.
  You can back up directly to a remote bup server, without needing tons
  of temporary disk space on the computer being backed up. And if your
  backup is interrupted halfway through, the next run will pick up
  where you left off. And it's easy to set up a bup server: just
  install bup on any machine where you have ssh access.
  Bup can use "par2" redundancy to recover corrupted backups even if
  your disk has undetected bad sectors.
  Even when a backup is incremental, you don't have to worry about
  restoring the full backup, then each of the incrementals in turn; an
  incremental backup acts as if it's a full backup, it just takes less
  disk space.
  You can mount your bup repository as a FUSE filesystem and access the
  content that way, and even export it over Samba.
  It's written in python (with some C parts to make it faster) so it's
  easy for you to extend and maintain."
  --  Avery Pennarun [1_]
.. _bup: .. _1: Both Brian Warner and David-Sarah Hopwood explained where `URLs are
generated`_ in Tahoe.
There is a lengthy discussion regarding the shutdown of the pubgrid and
any possible liability_ surrounding grids hosting illegal content.  On a
personal note, I would love for a member of the EFF_ to comment on this.
Olaf TNSB posted `an issue with OS X`_.  It turns out this issue is a
result of an incompatibility_ between zope.interface 3.6.4 and Nevow
Kevin Reid started a interesting discussion regarding the use of `Caja

.. _email: Interview with the Developers
This is quickly becoming my favorite section to write for the TWN.
While lurking in  is a great way to learn a good deal
about all assortments of topics, these interviews with the devs
have taught me all kinds of things about the code which is Tahoe, but
also about the people, ideas and the motivations behind it.  I hope
these interviews help make you as passionate about the project as it
has made me.
This week it was my pleasure to interview Peter Secor.  Peter is the
fomer President and CEO of Allmydata, Inc. and is the volunteer director
for Tahoe-LAFS.  Peter is currently working repairing the old prodcution
grid from allmydata.com and later moving the grid to S3.  If you are
interested in helping to repair the grid, please contact Peter.
Patrick: Give me a little introduction about yourself, tell me a bit
about who you are.
Peter: UC Berkeley undergraduate degree in applied mathematics with
lots of computer science classes, worked for a bit in hardware/software
integration, grad school at NYU in applied math, dropped out to help
start up a network management software company, sold that, helped start Allmydata to provide secure storage to consumers and enterprises.
I've lived in California, New York, Paris, Brussels.
Patrick: Wow, that's pretty impressive.  So how did you come to
develop for Tahoe-LAFS?
Peter: I was at Allmydata and we made the decision to develop the core
software as an open source project.  We went to Lake Tahoe for an
off-site to design the next generation distributed, encrypted storage
system.  Thus Tahoe was born.  Zooko and Warner were there along with a
few other people.
Patrick: Being one of the founders of Tahoe, what is your favorite
memory of the project?
Peter: My favorite memory so far, hmm b& thinking.  Ah, I know, my
favorite memories are of the hack-parties we threw at the Allmydata
offices.  We used to throw hack parties every time Zooko came out
to the Bay Area.  Allmydata would buy food and drinks, and we'd invite
people over for a small presentation on something interesting, and
then try to solve some problems.  Patrick: Sounds like a good deal of fun.
Peter: Yes, and we also fixed a lot of bugs or found a
Patrick: So the next big feature is MDMF due in 1.9.0. What feature or
features would you like to see in upcoming versions?
Peter: I would like to see the newly open-sourced javascript UI
cleaned up so that it can work by being served up by a grid.  It would
be a great example of an unhosted app, and very useful for managing
files on the grid.  I had it mostly working that way a couple years ago,
but there has been bit-rot.
Patrick: That is webdrive, correct?
Peter: Correct.
Patrick: Any words of wisdom for developers looking to join the
Tahoe team?
Peter: It's a good way to learn about Python, crypto, capability
models, or all of them at the same time!
Patrick: Where do you see Tahoe headed in the future?  One year
from now, what is new in Tahoe?
Peter: There are a couple operational things and a couple
functional things.  I'm looking forward to the MDMF on the functional
side, and a year from now I'd like to see some sort of accounting
built-in.  On the operational side, I'd like to have the website and
build master no longer dependent upon a single box in my garage and
migrated to virtual infrastructure.  I'd also like to see the foundation
get more funding support from outside sources, so that's something I'll
take on.
Patrick: As the volunteer director, what efforts can you talk
which looking to raise funds for Tahoe?
Peter: So, in order to raise funds, I'm talking to a few larger
companies (like Google, Adobe, etc) and also to a few other smaller,
niche companies that are interested in this area.  We've been
sponsored by Google Summer of Code a couple times, but I'd like to get
something more permanent.
Patrick: How do you like working the "suit" side of the project
as opposed to the coder portion?
Peter: I'm not a great coder, more of an integrator/prototyper,
so working the funding side is fine for me if it's a good cause.  I
think Tahoe-LAFS is important in a few ways, one of which is being able
to provide a solution that allows you to store files across corporate
infrastructures without having to divulge the content.  That gives a lot
of power to the end user as they can continue to own their data and
Patrick: Thank you very much for your time.  This has been a fantastic
Peter: Adios

template bug.  Please provide information on things you would like to
see, things you would like to see go.  Use it as a forum to provide us
with much needed feedback.  Help me, help you.
In all seriousness, the ticket of the week is 796_, write-only backup
caps.  Below is a direct quote from Zooko on why this ticket received
his nomination.
"The reason that I'm thinking of this is Bitcoin. I'm pretty excited
about Bitcoin, and I read the sad story of a Bitcoin user whose value
was stored on his computer in his wallet.dat file, and someone stole
that file and transferred all of his Bitcoins to themselves. At
current market rates, that was USD 500,000 worth!
Now if you use symmetric encryption on your wallet.dat file then this
does *not* protect you from malware which is running on your computer about Bitcoin, and I read the sad story of a Bitcoin user whose value
was stored on his computer in his wallet.dat file, and someone stole
that file and transferred all of his Bitcoins to themselves. At
current market rates, that was USD 500,000 worth!
Now if you use symmetric encryption on your wallet.dat file then this
does *not* protect you from malware which is running on your computer
[*]. Such malware can do whatever you can do, so if you can  symmetrically encrypt and decrypt your wallet (in order to, for
example, store more money in a symmetrically encrypted wallet) then
that allows the attacker to do the same and steal all your money. It
is like a lockbox that you have to open to put more cash in. But if
you open it, the attacker can steal everything from inside it.
On the other hand, public key encryption does not have the same
property. You can encrypt your b without having, on that same
computer, the ability to decrypt it, because your private key which is
necessary for decryption is stored somewhere else and you access it
rarely and carefully. This is more like a "piggy bank". A very strong
piggy bank. How about: it is like a piggy-bank-shaped safe that has a
little slot on top into which you can drop coins, but which cannot be
opened without the key/combination.
Some people currently protect their Bitcoin wallet by encrypting it
with gpg and then backing up the encrypted copy to a remote site. This
accomplishes the "piggy bank safe" scenario. Perfect! Except that most
people don't do it, because they don't know how to use gpg.
The Bitcoin developers are apparently working on adding symmetric
encryption to the official client. That would be the lockbox scenario.
In my opinion this is near-useless and may actually harm people by
giving them a false sense of security.
So, it would be cool, not only for Bitcoin wallets but also for all
other sorts of backups, if you had a "write-only capability", which  implements public key encryption just like the GPG scenario above, but
integrated into your Tahoe-LAFS filesystem and your automated
Tahoe-LAFS-based backups. This is the subject of 796_."

Tahoe-LAFS v1.8.3 Released
1.9.0a2_ was released.  In addition to the security fix mentioned above, this
release incorporates the following fixes:
* 'tahoe debug' commands now understand MDMF caps and shares (`
* Recent Uploads And Downloads shouldn't miss 'tahoe put' (`
* tests run slightly faster, still kinda painful
* 'tahoe put --mutable-type=.." implies --mutable
* fewer dropped errors (and lost-progress bugs) in mutable retrieve
* tolerate linux-3.0 in platform detection code (`
The following work remains for the 1.9.0 release:
* docs improvements
* minor fixes: really really minor
* packaging tests
* Foolscap needs a new release, so make sure Tahoe-LAFS is compatible
We highly encourage everyone to throughly test this release.  The more bugs
we find in the alpha, the less in the beta and the quicker 1.9.0 arrives.
Currently, there is a possibility of a Halloween release of 1.9.0.

Brian Warner |brian| has been using the Atlas Networks servers to do

Brian provided another `status update`_ on 1.9.  Work continues apace on
MDMF.  Some bugs forced the developers to restructure some of the MDMF code
resulting in the current delay.  Look for alpha2 this weekend.  A couple
weeks after alpha2 should be code freeze and the release of beta1.  While no
hard deadline is set, it appears 1.9 will see release in early October.
Raddi from NoiseBridge_ notified that their Tahoe-LAFS grid is coming along.
You may remember NoiseBridge from the first Tahoe-LAFS summit.  Thanks again to
NoiseBridge for providing us the space.
.. _status update: .. _NoiseBridge: Vlastimil posted a wonderful HOWTO on using `Tahoe-LAFS with pyfilesystem and
Dokan`_.  This HOWTO is also posted on the `Tips and Tricks page`_.
Renat posted a question on what to do when `adding new nodes` to a Tahoe
grid.  Zooko pointed him to the "repair" function.  To access the "repair"
function, in the WUI, click the repair button, in the CLI, run either "tahoe
check" or "tahoe deepcheck".  Ticket  covers automatically scheduling the
repair process.  It even includes a link to `Kevin Reid's cron script` which
does it automatically.
Lastly, Renat provide the statistics from his Suse Gallery Live CD of Tahoe.
  "6 builds, 1.5 GB - 32-bit x86 - edited 10 days ago

Moving to Git
Tahoe-LAFS is `moving to Git`_.  The `repo`_ lives on Github under the
Tahoe-LAFS organization account.
Tahoe-LAFS will run both darcs and git in parallel for a while.  Below are
the restrictions on what we can currently commit:
 * The bridge only handles linear histories. Brian |brian| will enforce this
   by rewriting and rebasing any changes that enter from the Git side
   before landing them on master.  Patches coming from the Darcs side are
   applied in single-file anyways, so no new restrictions there.
 * Brian runs the bridge manually (it's not safe enough to be run
   unsupervised), so there will be a human delay between the time
   something lands on the darcs side and the time it appears on the git
   side. Brian usually gets to it within a day, but feel free to ping him on
   IRC when you push a commit to darcs.
 * Nobody else should commit to the official git repo right now. When we
   stop using darcs (and the bridge), we can fix the permissions so that
   all Tahoe committers will have write access. Send pull requests and
   Brian will merge them appropriately.
 * Release branches will have to be managed specially. 1.8.3 does not
   yet exist in the git repo (Brian will need to build it manually). If we do
   a near-term 1.9.1 release, we'll probably do it from trunk.
Tahoe-LAFS has a new `buildmaster`_, which feeds off the Github
post-commit hook, and instructs buildslaves to update from Github.  We'll
be moving all the existing slaves to this buildmaster, and then
we will determine which ones need to have Git installed (or their buildbot
code updated). We'll also update to a newer buildbot version (0.8.5) at
the same time, and start using "categories" to organize the waterfall
views a bit more easily.
The developers also `moved pycryptopp`_ to Github.  The buildbot now
draws from Github, and all but one of the buildslaves upgraded to match.
  "The first pull request has been merged, to fix compile errors with the
  upcoming gcc-4.7.0 release. The second pull request, to add Ed25519
  signatures, is under review by Zooko."  [`1`_]
.. _`moving to Git`:
   .. _`repo`: .. _`buildmaster`: .. _`moved pycryptopp`: .. _`1`: 1.9.1 Release
Brian `announced the upcoming 1.9.1 release`_.  The team hopes to release
1.9.1 in the next couple of weeks.  The main drivers for this release are:
* ` UCWE on deep check with recent version
* upcoming Ubuntu LTS freeze.  We hope to get this fix in before the freeze
Ticket 1628 needs review, so please review the ticket.
In addition, some other changes have occurred since the 1.9.0 release which
will be included in 1.9.1:
* the download-status timeline visualizer was rewritten
* the WUI got a favicon
* OpenBSD 5 support was added
* PyCrypto 2.4 was blacklisted
* some internal refactoring
The changes will be included in the 1.9.1 release.
The following tickets are part of the `1.9.1 milestone`_:
* ` Repairing fails if less than 7 servers available
* ` Unhandled error in Deferred while uploading (current darcs build)
* ` compilation errors with pyOpenSSL >= 0.13 on RHEL5 systems (and
  clones)
* ` presence of MDMF in aliases break the CLI < v1.9.0
* ` assertion failure 'assert len(self._active_readers) >=
  self._required_shares' in mutable retrieve

Interview with Brian Warner
This past week, TWN interviewed Brian Warner |brian|.  Brian is a member
of the Tahoe-LAFS development team.  Brian is currently working on
Accounting which is a major milestone in Tahoe-LAFS.  Please thank Brian
for taking the time to provide us with this interview.
Patrick: First, why don't you introduce yourself to our readers, tell us
who you are?
Brian: sure, my name is Brian Warner, I'm a programmer based in San
Francisco. I created the Buildbot many many years ago, and the "EGD"
entropy-gathering daemon before that, I guess those are my two
best-known projects. I worked at AllMyData.com from 2005 to 2009, and
created Tahoe along with Zooko and our coworker Rob Kinninmont. I'm
probably still the author of the majority of the current code, but
that's slowly changing as we get more developers involved. By day, I'm a
developer at Mozilla, working on the Persona (aka BrowserID) project.
Patrick: Currently you are associated with the accounting work.  Can you
describe exactly what that is and why our readers will be interested in
the final results?
Brian: Yeah, the goal is to give Tahoe users more visibility into (and
control over) how their data is being stored, and how their server space
is being used. The current system is pretty all-or-nothing: as a server
operator, you can reserve some amount of disk space (and, for the most
part, the server won't use it to hold shares of client data), but you
can't find out that e.g. Alice is using 20GB but Bob is only using 3GB.
Similarly, as a client, you don't have control over where your shares
are placed: they'll be spread uniformly among any server that connects
to your grid, even though you might consider some of those servers to be
The general idea behind the Account project is that each client gets an
identifier (a public key), and each share they put on a server is kept
alive by a lease, which is tagged with their identifier.
Patrick: so accounting would allow me as a server operator to prevent
people from abusing the commons so to speak?
Brian: Right. All leases will have client identifiers: when you enable
"no free riders" mode, the server will reject completely anonymous
clients. To begin with, there will be no connection between the client
identifiers and anything else (names, etc). Servers will just get a
table of "client 123 is using 23GB of space", etc.  As a client, you'll
be able to volunteer a "nickname", so the table can say "client 123 (who
calls themselves Alice) is using 23GB". Later, we'll add better UI, so
if you've actually met Alice, and she tells you her ID, that table can
say "client 123 (who you know as Alice) is using 23GB". (technically
speaking, this will be a "petname").
We'll probably start with simple monitoring but then make it possible
for servers to require explicit approval from their admins before
accepting shares from new clients.  There are a lot of reasons why you
might hold data for someone else: maybe they're your friend, maybe
they're paying you, maybe they're providing service in kind.
Patrick: Sounds like a much robust system to control the service than is
currently in place.  I look forward to it.
Brian: In the long run, we want to make it easy to support lots of
modes: maybe using Bitcoin for purely economic pay-for-storage
transactions, or a form of tit-for-tat barter system where your usage is
limited by how much space you've provided for others.
Yeah, it's been a long road, but I think we're getting closer to finally
implementing the design.
Patrick: When should we expect to see accounting enter the stable
Brian: Oh, that's a good question. I'd like to say 6-12 months, but
given our history with this particular feature, I couldn't make any
promises. The problem is that we keep scaling back the design to make it
easier to implement, and then we discover all sorts of complexity that
means it's twice as hard as we anticipated. Then we talk about it a lot,
then we go away and forget about it for a while, then a few months later
we simplify it some more an try again.  I think we're on the 5th or 6th
cycle now, and realistically we probably have another one or two to go
before we get something implementable.
That said, it's likely that we can get some of the basics in place
(simple monitoring of space consumed) in the next six months.
Patrick: Certainly sounds like a fantastic way to start off the new
Brian: Heh, yeah, that'd be a nice holiday present.
Patrick: I will make sure to ask Santa.  You were also recently a
release manger for Tahoe-LAFS.  What was that like?
Brian: It was fun. I've driven other projects in the past (especially
Buildbot), so most of the work is mechanical: assembling release notes,
checking test results, building tarballs. And we've automated many of
the pieces. (not all of them: my goal is for a simple 'git tag; git
push' to trigger everything else, but we're not there yet). The main
thing about release management is all the "does this feature/bugfix/etc
make it in or not" decisions. That and bossing the other developers
around for a while: trying to get the most important changes completed
early enough so that you can get enough beta coverage to feel confident
in them. I work on other projects (BrowserID, and Firefox, for that
matter) that use a strict periodic "train" model, where the release
happens every N weeks regardless of what features are done: if you don't
get it finished, you miss the train, but that's ok because there's
another one just down the road that you can aim for. I don't think we
have enough developers or momentum (or automation) to use that mode for
Tahoe right now, but given another 6 months of practice, maybe we could
pull it off.  For a small project, periodic releases run the risk of
having an empty release when nothing significant has been landed.
Patrick: Wow, that was pretty in depth.  Great answer.  What is your
favorite part about working on Tahoe-LAFS?
Brian:  Hm.. one big part is getting to brainstorm with Zooko and
David-Sarah and the others: talking through a design in realtime is a
lot of fun, and we come at it from such different angles; I always
learn so much from that interaction. It's also great to get to build
something that works "Correctly" (with a capital C), without the dozens
of little assumptions and compromises that break the security of most
other tools. This may sacrifice usability or compatibility, but I'm ok
with building something right and then trying to make it more usable
later (doing it the other way around is a well-explored space). But I
think my favorite part is that this project is starting to influence
others: we're establishing the notion that storing things "in the cloud"
doesn't have to mean giving up control over your security. Sort of
adjusting people's expectations, making them realize they deserve more.
We've got projects like Unhosted out there working on making data
storage independent from application service, Firefox Sync providing
client-side encryption of browser data, and Tarsnap doing client-side
security, all of which are in this family of reducing reliance on the
server's behavior. It's great space to be working in.
Patrick: Okay, two more questions. First what would you like to see TWN
which it isn't doing now and where would you like Tahoe-LAFS to go in
the next year?
Brian: Hm, I guess it'd be fun to have TWN cover some of the questions
that have come up in the development meetings: e.g. recently we've
been talking about whether Accounting should lean towards an
"invitation" model (in which you join a grid by getting invited by
someone/anyone who's already in the grid), or a more
centralized/explicit model (in which one person controls the whole grid,
and adds people by including their public key in a config file). It'd be
great to hear from the wider community what they think about the
different potential models, and TWN might be a better vehicle for that
question than just the tahoe-dev mailing list.
As for Tahoe itself, personally I'm getting more interested in browser
integration (tahoe-as-addon, "lafs://" URLs, web-apps that can store
their runtime state in a tahoe filesystem), and easier grid-management
tools (the "invitation" model, simple Accounting controls). I'd love to
simplify our protocols enough to get developers comfortable with porting
Tahoe to other languages: we used Foolscap because it provided
everything we needed (and because I wrote it) but it's too big, and that
discourages folks from porting it (and Tahoe) to Ruby or Javascript,
etc.  I'm especially eager to get the larger world of web-service
authors (like the Node.js community) interested in Tahoe, or Tahoe-like
systems, to tap into some of the energy building in that space.
Patrick: That would be really cool.  Anything else you would like to add
to the interview?
Brian: Nope, just thanks for the time, and thanks for putting so much
energy into our little project.  TWN is a great service you provide to
this community.  I really appreciate your dedication!

Tahoe-LAFS Users Group Meeting, San Francisco, Tuesday 2013-03-19
JoePie91 who runs the `Cryto Coding Collective`_ and its associated grid
has established a new site, `ReDonate`_
"ReDonate is a service for 'voluntary recurring donations'. What this
means in simple terms, is that we allow you to set up recurring
donations to a service, without ever making an automatic charge.
ReDonate works much like a calendar application - every month, you'll
receive an e-mail reminding you of your pledge. The e-mail will include
donation links, so that you can make the donation you pledged, straight
If you want to skip a month or even unsubscribe from a donation
campaign, that's fine! There are no hoops to jump through, no
cancellation periods, and no other kinds of hassle involved.
Basically, it's recurring donations how they were intended - as a
voluntary periodic contribution to a campaign. No automatic charges, no
subscription lock-ins, no other nasty things." [`0`_]
Tahoe-LAFS is proud to be one of the initial campaigns along with
`Torservers`_ and others. Thank you to JoePie91 for running this

Agenda: Tahoe-LAFS v1.10 (Nuts and Bolts)
This was awesome. We got lots of tickets closed, or at least pushed
forward a step or two. This was the most productive hour of
ticket-closing work ever. We're going to do it again next week! If
you like doing code-review and writing unit tests, you should join
You can see also use the Trac Timeline:
ClashTheBunny has some patches for IPv6 for Tahoe-LAFS and Foolscap
( and has some tests of them but needs more thorough tests.
However, we didn't look at that this time, because we focused on
tickets for Tahoe-LAFS v1.10.
Nejucomo said on IRC that he wasn't going to get around to manually
verifying that the bug we fixed in ticket  was the same as the
bug he reported. I decided to just close the ticket for the
following reasons: there *is* a bug that we understand, there is a
fix which is clear, there is a unit test that exercises the bug that
is red without the fix and green with the fix, and The
Dod manually verified that it fixed the problem in practice for him.
The only reason we've left the ticket open waiting for Nejucomo to
test is in case Nathan actually has a *different* bug than this one.
But we don't need to keep the ticket open for that eventuality.
ClashTheBunny did design review on  He approved the design and
made good comments that showed that he actually had thought about it.
Subsequently Zooko added another design question and assigned it to
Brian for design re-re-re-review.
We looked at  It is a blocker because it makes the SFTP frontend
incompatible with the current stable release of Twisted. However it is
closed as a duplicate of  because the improvement in  would
remove the incompatibility. We briefly considered kludging it by
requiring people to install an older Twisted, but instead decided to
fix it the good way. David-Sarah had already implemented the fix to
 but there was something wrong with the unit test.
NEWFLASH! This just in! As we were going to press, David-Sarah posted on
 a comment that they are currently working on it.
We discussed  David-Sarah had an idea for how to make the
implementation simple, by incrementing the server-wide counter once for
each service. Brian will work on it. It and  are the two blockers
that require new code to be written before we release Tahoe-LAFS v1.10.
We closed  as fixed. Yay!
 is finished, reviewed, and ought to go into Tahoe-LAFS v1.10, but
I can't figure out how to merge it into master using git. I don't
understand how to use git very well, since I've only been using it on a
daily basis for a little more than two years now...
 was already applied, but there was something wrong with it
according to Brian. Do we need to fix that as a blocker for 1.10 release?
We agreed to drop support for Python 2.5 and therefore for CentOS 5.
In the last few minutes of the hangout, we agreed that next week's
hangout will be another Nuts And Bolts like this one, hopefully bringing
Tahoe-LAFS v1.10 close to completion. Brian will work on  Someone
(maybe Zooko??) will work on Then we briefly mentioned the possibility of switching from a "semantic
versioning" style version number, to a YEAR.RELEASE_COUNT version number
like Twisted does. So instead of Tahoe-LAFS v1.10, this might be
Tahoe-LAFS v13.0. Then if there is another release in 2013, that would be
Tahoe-LAFS v13.1. We also considered leaving it alone for the "v1.10"
release, and switching styles for the next release.
Currently we use the "1." in "Tahoe-LAFS v1.10" to mean that it has
backward-compatibility with all of the stable Tahoe-LAFS releases since
v1.0 (released March 25, 2008:
). I'm not sure that's accurate. While we have never deliberately
violated that goal, and we are not aware of any change that we've made
which would break that compatibility, on the other hand we don't have
automated or manual testing of backwards compatibility. Anyway, I
suspect that there aren't any users of Tahoe-LAFS versions older than
1.9.2: tickets mentioned in this letter:
*  use ipv6
*  CLI: overzealous
  quoting of error messages
*  SFTP: handle
  download failures correctly; remove use of IFinishableConsumer
*  Nondeterministic
  NoSharesError for direct CHK download in 1.8.3 and 1.9.1
*  consider changes
  to webapi "Move" API before release
*  write test for
  anti-Ubuntu-crash-reporter exception-catching code
*  update
  Announcement "timestamp": sequence number?
*   parse_abbreviated_size doesn't accept T for terabytes (and other

   Monthly State of the Public Grid
Below is Paul Rabahy's `monthly status of the public grid`_.
"The new public grid appears to be gaining traction quite well. I figure
now that it has been in operation a little more than a month it would be
good to give a quick overview of its status and any other observation
that I have had.
I want to thank the storage nodes that have been reliably connected
including the following:
The public writable test directory has been used by several people
(including myself) for various experiments. So far I haven't noticed any
"Currently the shares directory on the PRabahy node weighs in at about
650MB. The largest individual share is about 172MB (~25% of the total
I encourage everyone that is able to setup a storage node to help
newcomers dive into Tahoe-LAFS as easily as possible. My goal is to have
at least 10 storage nodes connected to the public grid at any time.
Warning - The public grid is a service provided for experimentation and
learning. Please do not store any important files on the public grid.
The grid may go offline at anytime without prior notice."

This issue's glowing quote is a little different. It comes from inside
Tahoe-LAFS, but I feel it really hits on something really awesome about
"A 20-minute demo of installing the Tahoe-LAFS software, deploying a
grid of storage servers, using them to upload, download and browse
files. Then the punch line: did you notice what we *didn't* do during
this demo? Screw around with certificates, keys, encryption, or
decryption! You don't have to spend your time messing with that stuff
in order to use Tahoe-LAFS." - Zooko Wilcox-O'Hearn [`2`_]
