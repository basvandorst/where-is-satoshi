Actually, a 12-gage shotgun is approximately .73 caliber.  Maybe it was a 16-gage?  BTW, many "real terrorist incidents" are acknowledged by the group committing them, so that they will win support for their "cause," or notoriety, or whatever other gratification their sick minds might derive from carnage.  The fact that no one has claimed responsibility for the bombing skews the perpetrator probabilities more toward a single disturbed individual or a Reichstag rehash.
The chupa-cabras, Grays, and the Art Bell Fan Club would file an EEOC class-action lawsuit, citing preferential treatment for beings that "the average citizen" actually BELIEVES in.  More lawyer-bait.

In addition to powder residue, collect all the spent shell casings you can, especially ones that are of the same caliber as weapons you own. In addition to the possibility of reloading them (and saving a bundle on ammo costs) you can sprinkle them around liberally in the aftermath of an encounter (assuming you survive) and give the crime scene people a bunch of red herrings to deal with. Of course, you should never touch them, (the FBI got DNA samples from stamps the Unabomber licked on his mailbombs, so even tiny droplets of sweat can bust you) and you should collect the actual brass fired and sandblast it.
Incidentally, one of the interesting traits of a shotgun is that buckshot is not subject to the ballistics matching techniques used on rifle and pistol bullets. The plastic wads (which prevent the shot from touching the barrel) do not take the microscopically detailed impressions from the barrel that copper or lead bullets do. The heat from firing always melts the plastic slightly--enough to defeat this.  Of course, if you leave the fired shells lying around, the primer and ejector marks can bite you...
Of course, this means that every time they lose your luggage, you will be detained for "suspected terrorist activity", and the plane your luggage was wrongly sent to will be evacuated while the bomb squad takes it to a remote area and blows it up... (the luggage, not the plane)

@_subject: Ballistics 
A much better idea is to clean the barrel with a stiff wire brush. If you blue the inside of the barrel, and then brush the bluing off, that is enough. Alternatively/additionally, fire several hundred rounds with the weapon.  Either will change the microscopic pattern of grooves sufficiently to cause a mismatch. Poking a file around in the barrel is a good way to ruin a gun.
Changing barrels is a good idea as well. I can change the barrel on my Desert Eagle in about 15 seconds. A better idea yet is to fabricate a removable silencer (that can be attached/detached without modifying the barrel) with a wire brush surrounding the muzzle opening (similar to a batery terminal cleaner, but sturdier, of course) so that the bristles put their own marks on the bullet as it leaves the barrel. Even if the silencer is found, you will never be able to put it on aligned exactly the same way, and the marks will not line up exactly. Alternatively, you could mount the bristles on a bearing so they can rotate freely, so the patterns of marks constantly change as the brush rotates. Of course, getting caught with a silencer is a good way to go directly to jail without passing GO.
Of course, if you are serious about avoiding this kind of hassle, you will mount a bag to the receiver of your gun to catch the fired shells, so that they aren't lying around for curious people to find.

If the shell cases are NOT left at the crime scene, there is NO link between them and the crime. You are suffering from cranio-rectal inversion.
That doesn't address the fact that (1) there are billions of unstamped shell casing extant, (2) stamping the side of a case will weaken it and be a significant safety hazard, (3) stamps in the head of the case can be filed/scraped off, (4) cases not left at the crime scene have no value as evidence, regardless of any serial stamps, extractor marks, etc. Even if you can prove a shell was fired in a particular gun, if there is no link between that gun and the crime, the "evidence" is worthless. You are suffering from cranio-rectal inversion.
See above. You are suffering from cranio-rectal inversion.
That's BLACK powder, stupid! Also, profiling a bomber requires more than one crime. A profile is a psychological analysis of the patterns in a criminal's handiwork, and patterns cannot be clearly deliniated with a single crime.

I am very skeptical of this. When a gun is fired, the shell casing becomes quite hot--hot enough to burn skin. (I have learned this from experience--once when firing my semi-auto .22 at a range, an ejected casing bounced off a post next to me and landed inside my collar. The resulting burn formed a blister on my neck.) This kind of heat has a tendency to evaporate the skin oils that fingerprints are composed of, which is going to make getting any useful print from the case extremely difficult. Also, when the gun is fired, the pressure inside the case presses it flat against the chamber wall, which is going to smudge the print, especially on semi-autos where extraction occurs while there is still a significant amount of pressure in the case. Furthermore, most shell cases are too small to get anything close to a complete print, which makes positive matching even more difficult. It is much more believable that prints were taken from the gun, which is handled more (thereby collecting more prints) and which generally doesn't reach skin-damaging temperatures.
Regardless of feasibility of collecting prints from cases, serial numbers on ammunition is still a stupid idea. Currently, all firearms are required to have serial numbers. However, serial numbers only rarely help solve crimes. Most criminals use weapons that have had the serial number welded over, filed off, etc. or that have been stolen, so the gun is registered in someone else's name, or both. Registration is a vastly more effective tool for the government to know where most of the lawfully owned firearms are (and who owns them) than it is at preventing or solving any crime. Putting serial numbers on ammo has all of the same problems, except the paperwork would be worse because people purchase ammo more frequently than guns.
Imagine someone breaks into your house while you are gone, and steals your serial-numbered gun and serial-numbered ammo. Then he uses them to stick up some of the local Stop-N-Rob's in your neighborhood while wearing the same gloves and ski mask he wore at your house. He fires numerous shots and reloads the gun several times, leaving fired cases in each store. After the last robbery, he dumps the gun in a storm drain, burns the gloves and mask, and catches the next flight to Tahiti. Do you really think that serial numbers on the gun or the ammo are going to help YOU?
Also, 32 bits of serial number is not enough. Over a billion rounds of .22 Long Rifle are fired in the US annually. Need I say more?
Since there are already natural means of positively matching bullets to guns, guns to cases, and guns to fingers, which cannot be used to falsely implicate anyone, , and since the claimed benefits of serial numbering can easily be circumvented by unscrupulous persons (in other words, CRIMINALS) I contend that serial numbers are a much better tool for facilitating a police state than for reducing crime.
obCrypto: How about defining the "number" as an MD5 hash of the X-Y coordinates of the entry points of 15 pellets of 00 buckshot in the criminal's chest, sorted in ascending order X, Y? (ORDER BY X ASC, Y ASC)

In 1981, the city of Kennesaw, GA suffered 17 violent crimes and 55 burglaries. In 1982, Kennesaw passed an ordinance requiring all city residents to own a firearm, and there was only 1 violent crime and 19 burglaries. In 1983, Kennesaw experienced 3 violent crimes and 9 burglaries. I think that the cause-effect relationship is obvious.

@_subject: Opiated file systems 
Here is an idea for implementing DuressSFS and/or NukeTheData functions on demand with plausible deniability for all (without all your keys, TLA's wouldn't know how many encrypted partitions you had:
1. Doing anything with the encrypted file system requires 2 keys.
2. The first key decrypts the FAT (the FAT info is always written to the disk encrypted) and an encrypted control sector, which is cylinder 0, head 0, sector JustAfterTheMBRAndPartionTable.  This control sector is divided into 16 32-byte (256-bit) fields or records.
3. If a hash of the key entered matches the undecrypted contents of record 0, (bytes 0-31) the EFS enters an infinite whole-drive encryption loop, using a hash of the key provided and any handy entropy, to produce a new key.  The EFS will produce new keys as frequently as possible by hashing any entropy it can gather while nuking the data on the drive. While this is happening, dummy messages should be displayed, such as "Starting Windows 95...", "An exception has ocurred at XXXX:XXXXXXXX  Press any key to continue." (when the entropy stock needs replenishment) or any other reasonably common startup messages. (NukeTheData) (TM)
4. If the first key is not the NukeTheData key, the EFS prompts for a second 5. After receiving the second key, the EFS hashes it and compares the hash to the data in the control sector records, and mounts any encrypted logical drive(s) with matching key hashes.
6. If an incorrect second key is entered X times(X between 3 and 20), (NukeTheData = True) is assumed, and executed.
Using this system, without the first key, it should be impossible to tell how many separate encrypted logical drives there are on the disk. Without the second key(s) the data in the ELD's should be worthless.  On bootup, the pass phrase entry screen should be designed to look exactly like the CMOS bootup password screen, and no messages indicating the existence of EFS should be displayed until after a correct 2nd key has been entered.  Why advertise your security measures?  Unless "they" have been tipped off to the fact that you use EFS, they can easily destroy all of the data through ignorance, especially if you have a PostIt note with the NukeTheData password/phrase (which wouldn't have to be "good"--you could use "GovtStupid" or something similar) stuck to the side of your monitor, and keep your mouth shut during interrogation.

If you lock your doors and windows, forced entry generally becomes a noisy, somewhat time-consuming process that allows anyone not in a recreational drug induced stupor or coma sufficient time to pull a pistol out of their shoulder holster (or nightstand drawer, etc.) and pull the hammer back.  (2-3 seconds is all I need!)
In the majority of cases, (although the margin is on the decline) when an armed homeowner confronts a burglar, the burglar runs like projectile diarrhea for the nearest exit, and no shots are fired.  However, these incidents are not counted as firearms "use", under current crime statistic collection methodology.  Many of these incidents are not reported, especially in areas where gun ownership is not approved by the authorities.  Furthermore, if your Cousin Vinnie the crack addict breaks into your house at 0300, attempts to rob you at knifepoint, and you force-feed him half a dozen jacketed hollow points for his trouble, the incident will usually be put in the same statistical category as the "crazed husband shoots wife, children, 11 neighbors, and 6 police officers" tragedies, even though you may never be charged with anything.  Most "studies" of crime statistics come from gun control advocacy groups, and are suitable primarily for lining the bottoms of birdcages.
I have $10 US that says that this idiot has never fired a gun is his life.  Furthermore, it is obvious he has no clue when it comes to bullet/target interaction.  A "reversed semi-wadcutter" is going to stay in its original shape (for the most part), which will tend to make it over-penetrate, wasting kinetic energy and endangering people behind the target.  Moreover, anyone who intentionally uses an inaccurate load is a fool--missed shots waste ammo, have no effect on the target, and run a significant risk of endangering innocent people.  A hollow point or Glaser is a much better option.

Obviously, the technique is crude, (translation software on autopilot works in mysterious ways) but it ought to be used by anyone wishing to anonymously communicate.  To really work properly, the original message should be worded so that the translator program understands all of the words in the message (none of the words are bracketed and left untranslated).  Otherwise, an analysis of untranslated words can be made.  The subject matter, etc. can still be studied, but at least most conventional profiling techniques are rendered orders of magnitude more difficult by this process.

[Begin Rant]
As I write this, I am listening to the news coverage of the bombing in Centennial Park.  The ABC news reports are already linking the suspected Georgia Militia members accused of plotting to use pipe bombs at the Olympic Games.  Just like OKC, the militia-gun owner-right-wing extremist smear is gearing up before the blood has a chance to dry.  On the other hand, the govt seems to be awfully reluctant to admit the obvious about TWA 800...
[End Rant]
Here is the how the voting system works.
1.  All voting information (public keys, ballots, ballot signatures, etc.) is publicly available via a Web site or other similar means, and can be downloaded in its entirety by anyone who cares to take the trouble to do so.  The software (and source code) used to generate ballots should be publicly available as well.
2.  When someone registers to vote, they submit a RSA public key to a registered voter key database.  The public key database does not contain voter information; only keys.  Access to the key entry terminals is controlled, so that only registered voters can submit keys.  A receipt is given to the voter with a hash of the key printed on it (PGP fingerprint style), the key entry clerk's name,  a receipt serial number, etc., so the voter can verify the correct key was put in the system, and who to shoot if it wasn't.
3.  On election day, each voter submits a ballot signed with their private key. The ballot contains the fingerprint of the voter's public key, the voter's choices, (preferably in a standardized ASCII format) and the digital signature. The ballot goes into the vote database regardless of whether it is valid or not. The voter receives a printed receipt confirming that the ballot was entered in the database, with a hash of the entire ballot (headers, signature, and all), receipt serial number, etc.
4.  After the election, each voter can verify whether their public key and ballot are in the database, and see whether their vote is deemed valid or not (if the signature on the ballot can be verified by a key in the key database). If there are any discrepancies, the voter has the public key, the ballot, and the receipts to prove that his vote should be counted.
5.  Since the key/vote databases are not connected to individuals, no one can connect votes to voters unless cheating occurs during the registration process. If there is fraud or other errors, the key/ballot/receipt combo is all that is necessary to prove the error--no identification of the bearer is required.
6.  Keys in the system should expire every few years.
Any comments / constructive criticisms welcome.

@_subject: Publicly Verifiable Anonymous Voting System 
To the extent that no link is recorded between a particular key and a particular voter, the system is anonymous. As I said in the original post, if the govt cheats during the key registration process, the system is not anonymous. However, if the registered voter database and the key/ballot database are on non-connected, separate systems, it is certainly possible to devise a key registration protocol to ensure anonymity.
Here is a more detailed description of the registration method:
1.  The registration process takes place in two separate rooms, one anonymous, and one non-anonymous, which are staffed by separate people, with separate computer systems.  The only way to enter/exit the anonymous room is via the non-anonymous room.
2.  The voter enters the non-anonymous room, where he provides proofs of identity and residence and is entered in the registered voter database, which is NOT publicly available.
3.  Once the voter has demonstrated eligibility, he is given a token that designates him as a registered voter, but has no personal information. A hard-to-counterfeit carved rod (too large to conceal on one's person) or something similar would be a good choice.
4.  The token gives the voter clearance to enter the anonymous room. Upon presenting the token, the voter inputs his key into the key database. (Insert your key disk in drive A and press Enter...) After the key has been entered into the system, the voter is given the receipt indicating that his key has been entered in the key database.
5.  The voter goes back to the non-anonymous room.  He turns in the token, signs a statement indicating that he entered a key and received a receipt for it, (to prevent voters from registering more than one key and thus voting more than once) and then goes home.

@_subject: strengthening remailer protocols 
Instead of that, how about this?
1. Create a pool of N remailers, each with its own set of public/private key pairs.  The public key(s) for each remailer are widely disseminated. Each remailer also publishes a list of other remailers that it will poll for messages. (More about this later.)
2. Each remailer user MUST have at least 1 public/private key pair per nym.  The public key should be widely available.
3. Each message is encrypted with the intended recipient's (nym's) public key, and then with each remailer's public key succesively, but in reverse order. (The message is encrypted last with the public key of the first remailer in the chain.)  The chain is determined by selecting some subset of N at random, with the set growing as the need for security increases. Encryption is done a la PGP, with a header prepended to the message containing the fingerprint of the public key used to encrypt the session key used to encrypt the actual message. Each layer of encryption encrypts the header of the previous layer of encryption as well as the message, so only the last encryption is "visible", and it is not feasible to detect the number of encryptions by examining the message.
4. The multiply-encrypted message is sent to the first remailer in the chain.  The remailer decrypts the message with its private key, and at this point one of two things can happen. If the decrypted message specifies an email address, the remailer sends the message to the specified address. Otherwise, it posts it in a publicly available database with 3 fields. 2 are public; one contains the key fingerprint of the outermost public encryption key, and the other contains the message itself.  The third, private field contains the date/time the record was added to the database. Any appropriate techniques for reducing input/output correlation can be used, such as delaying the decryption for random time intervals, dummy messages between remailers, etc. Remailer-to remailer traffic (or to any nym that gets a lot of traffic) should should be bundled together (take a few hours worth of traffic going to a specific nym, ZIP it into one large message, and re-encrypt using that nym's public key) to prevent a sender from being able to recognize any of his messages in transit.
5. Anyone can do lookups in the public fields of the message database by key fingerprint. Remailer users do this to download their messages, and remailers download messages from other remailers in this manner as well. Anyone can download any message in the database; only the intended recipient will be able to decrypt it. Messages are not deleted when they are downloaded; instead they are kept for a fixed period of time (determined by the remailer operator) and then deleted. If users are required to download other people's messages, tracing a message to one specific person will be much more difficult.
6. Steps 4 and 5 are repeated until the final recipient receives his message and decrypts it, at which time crypto-anarchic utopia can resume.
Randumb Thotz:
Given an encryption program with a database of which remailers poll other remailers, remailer chaining can be automated, and be done randomly.
If 2 nyms can agree to poll a mutually known set of remailers, (such as via anonymous Usenet/Blacknet postings) 2-way anonymous correspondence can occur without either nym having to know the other nym's email address. The remailer operators wouldn't know either, but they may be able to make reasonably informed guesses at recipient-nym relationships via analysis of database browsing patterns.  This is the the weakest part of the proposal, and suggestions for preventing this would be appreciated.
Remailers should use SSL or other encrypted communication protocols to ensure that third parties cannot observe who is browsing what in the public message Jonathan Wienke

@_subject: Socio-Economic Cults (Re: Cypherpunk Cults) 
Excuse me, but if you are referring to the Old West, you are seriously
misinformed.  While there certainly was violent crime, the murder rate
(excluding self-defense, deaths from wars, etc.) was actually lower than it
is today.  I came across a doctoral thesis written several years ago that
did a statistical analysis of population data and newspaper obituaries in
cities like Tombstone from around 1850-1890.  The conclusion of the paper
was that while the drinking/gambling/red light districts were certainly
violent places, in general, there was less crime than there is today.  The
life of criminals is hard when everyone is armed, and when the justice
system actually executes convicted murderers in a timely fashion.  (Capital
punishment is the only treatment for criminals that has a 0% recidivism rate.)
Of course, the primary flaw in your logic is that you assume anyone who
wants to own a gun is deranged or unbalanced somehow, and that gun
ownership causes crime.  There are at least 200 million (registered) guns
in the USA, (no reliable figures are available for the quantity of
illegally imported, homemade, and otherwise unregistered weapons) and at
least half of the households in the USA have at least one gun.
Miraculously enough, most people are not murderers or violent criminals,
and even the rate of accidental firearm death/injury has steadily declined
despite increases in the rate of gun ownership.
I had a gun in my pocket when my wife told me she was having an affair with
one of her co-workers, and yet 18 months later, both she and the "other
man" are both alive and healthy--no bullet holes.  I have not even
threatened to misuse firearms in such a manner, since that accomplishes
nothing more than exchanging one set of problems for a new, and more
annoying set.  (Being cheated on sucks, but I am sure that being
anal-rammed by a bunch of HIV+ fat guys in prison sucks even worse.)
Amazingly enough, most people in America have more in common with me than
Colin Ferguson.  (He's the guy who did the Long Island commuter train
It really isn't that hard to figure out that shooting a guy breaking
through your bedroom window at 3 AM with a crowbar and a TEC-9 is a Good
Thing, (at least if you value your continued existence, and that of your
family) while shooting someone giving you the finger on the way in to work
is a Bad Thing.  In the second case, there is no threat to your life
involved, so there is no reason to kill anyone.  In the first case, there
is.  Is this brain surgery?

pathologist, LtCol Steve Cogswell, was one of the doctors who processed the
bodies from the plane crash which supposedly killed fromer Commerce
secretary Ron Brown.  LtCol Cogswell took an X-ray of Ron Brown's skull,
and found a circular hole .45 inches in diameter in the skull, as well as
some metal fragments inside the cranial cavity, consistent with a gunshot
wound.  The original X-rays were destroyed, and no autopsy was performed to
determine the cause of death; but a photographer took some pictures of the
x-rays while they were on display, and these pictures were NOT destroyed. LtCol Cogswell provided copies of the photos of the x-rays to Ruddy, and
they were printed in a newspaper out east somewhere (I missed a few minutes
of the interview).  Today, I heard that LtCol Cogswell has been placed
under a gag order and his his house was searched by MP's.  Something is

@_subject: Technology 'secures' gunfire [CNN] 
This would be a network of microphones and processing stations which could
perform a reverse-GPS location analysis of sounds picked up by 3 or more
microphones.  (Sounds common to 2 microphones could be localized with a
lower degree of accuracy if directional microphone arrays are used.)  Yet
another instance of Big Brother technology that is of limited value to the
police.  Of course, this means that you will have the police responding to
every backfiring car, which will dampen their enthusiasm for responding
unless full-auto fire or a prolonged gunfight is overheard.  Of course, if
you have a silenced weapon and some cherry bombs with cigarette time-delay
fuses, you can use this system to docoy the police into the wrong
neighborhood.  Or if you confine yourself to single-shot assassinations
near busy streets, it will probably be written off as a vehicle backfire,
especially if you are doing a drive-by with a suppressed shotgun.  (Not
possible to silence completely, but certainly possible to quiet to the
point that it wouldn't attract undue notice along a busy street.)
In order for this system to be worth anything, it would have to be able to:
1.  Use voice recognition techniques to classify the type of weapon
(primarily useful for machine guns--it could evaluate the frequency
characteristics, rate of fire, etc. to distinguish between an AK-47 and an
UZI) sufficiently well to distinguish between small-arms fire, fireworks
(cherry bombs, M-80's, etc) and vehicle backfires.
2.  Perform "scream analysis" to distinguish the typical screams of
children at play from those of gunshot victims.
3.  Monitor conversations throughout the coverage area.  A suspicious sound
preceded by a male voice saying "Give me your money, bitch" would be much
more interesting than one preceded by a revving engine.  This would have
the added benefits of allowing LEO's to track fugitives via the sound of
their footsteps, their breathing, vehicle engine sounds, etc., as well as
gathering voiceprint data from crimes in progress.
I think point 3 is the scariest.  A properly designed system could do
voiceprint analysis of almost every word spoken in public, tie the
conversations to the identities of the speakers, and archive the time,
location, content and participants of every spoken conversation for long
periods of time in a database that could be searched by keyword, speaker
identity, time, and/or location.  The following searches could be done:
1.  "I want a list of everyone who uttered the words 'buy' and 'crack' in
the same sentence between 2100 and 0330 hours within 500 feet of 123 Maple
Drive between August 7 and December 5."
2.  "I want a list of all participants in conversations with Citizen-Unit
754-35-9710 which included the phrase 'BATF agent' in the last 6 months.
3.  "I want a map of Citizen-Unit 754-35-9710's movements for the last 2
4.  "I want to see the movement history of all '96 Ford Escorts with a
misfire on cylinder 5.  "I want the identities of everyone involved in the assault that
happened at the corner of Maple and Main at 1752 hours yesterday.
The Big Brother potential of such a system should be obvious.  What is
really scary is that such a system could be built mostly with currently
existing hardware, and at most a few man-years of software development.  If
each node in the network performs its own speech to text conversion and
archiving, and coordinates with a central voiceprint ID server, (which
could also provide the sync signal that the nodes would use to
cross-reference between nodes to locate sounds) each node could consist of
a Pentium 200 with some specialized audio signal processing cards and 15-20
GB of storage.  The only really new thing required would be an .AVI-style
format for storing MPEG audio, a text transcript of said audio (which would
need to include keywords for gunshots, passing vehicles, and other events
of interest), and location coordinates (updated on a second to second
basis) which could be indexed for reasonably efficient searching.

We in the U.S. are approximately where Germany was in the mid-1930's.  The
Holocaust did not start with anti-Semitic genocide; it started with
abortion.  After abortion became popular, infanticide, euthanasia and
assisted suicide were introduced.  (This is where the U.S. is at; witness
Jack Kevorkian and partial-birth infanticide.)  Once these became popular,
they began to become mandatory for individuals that were or were likely to
become a burden to the state.  After that, expanding the focus to include
Jews, Communists, Gypsies, and other groups on Hitler's shit list was a
trivial exercise.  I believe that the same process that happened in Germany
is at work in the U.S.; it is just progressing at a slower rate.
If there is another civil war in the U.S., I believe that the U.N. will
become involved.  I have been hearing stories of Russian soldiers escorting
trespassers out of the U.N. biosphere zones of various national parks for
several years now.  American soldiers may have pangs of conscience when
ordered to fire on fellow Americans, but Russian or Chinese soldiers most
likely wouldn't.  Perhaps acquiring East Bloc weapons isn't such a bad idea
after all if you can steal compatible equipment from the enemy...

@_subject: Big Brother Is Watching ATMs 
Hash: SHA1
I just heard that a bank card company has just released a program for using
photos of the iris in people's eyes as a biometric ID to replace people's
PIN codes for ATM / credit cards.  What I found really interesting is how
they plan to implement it.  As people use the ATM, they are photographed. (Every ATM has a security camera.)  Over time, as people use the ATM, the
security camera images are composited to produce a high-quality image of
their irises, which is coded and placed in their account information.  Once
this is accomplished, when a card is inserted into the ATM and the security
camera gets an iris image that matches the account sufficiently closely,
the user can conduct transactions without entering the PIN code.  People
affected by this will merely receive a letter that under certain
circumstances, entering the PIN is no longer necessary, but this is not a
security problem.
This scenario may not be a security problem, but it certainly poses a
privacy problem.  Given the frequency that the average Joe Sixpack uses the
ATM, it is only a matter of time before the government mandates a
nationwide eyeprint ID database to catch ATM and credit card theives, money
launderers, tax cheats, and other undesirables.  Perhaps the eyeprint could
even replace or supplement the SSN as the unique taxpayer ID key for tax
and other purposes.  Of course, given the fact that ATMs have had cameras
from the start, this theoretical eyeprint database could already be under
construction.  How's that for paranoia?  >:-(
Of course, there are a few ways to beat this, such as mirror sunglasses,
(which would only be useful while alternative credentials to eyeprint ID
are still available) and contact lenses, (which would have to be carefully
oriented so that the same side of the lens was always up, or the fact that
you are wearing contacts and are therefore a Suspicious Personï¿½ would
become obvious to the system) and of course intraocular implants of various
types.  Of course if the implant's power-on LED gives your eyes a constant
Satanic red glow, you may be flagged as a Suspicious Personï¿½ anyway.

You are right to the extent that the US has a more violent culture than the
UK and many other European countries, and has a higher murder rate.
However, your argument that the presence of guns == corpses is demonstrably
false.  Private ownership of firearms has a significant deterrent effect on
violent crime.  This may not be obvious when comparing the US to the UK,
but when comparing the statistics for areas within a country, region, or
city, it becomes indisputable.
Before Kennesaw, Georgia passed its famous (or infamous) ordinance
requiring each household in the city to own a gun and allowing concealed
carry of firearms, it had an average of 25-27 violent crimes (murder, armed
robbery, etc) per year.  After the ordinance was passed, there was one
violent crime the first year, and three the next.  The gun control shills
in the press reported this as a tripling in the violent crime rate.  Since
the state of Florida passed a "shall issue" concealed carry law (if you
apply, pay the fee, pass the safety course, and are not a felon or mentally
incompetent, the state shall issue you a concealed carry permit) it has
experienced significant reductions (10-20%) in the rates of murder, rape,
armed robbery, and other violent crimes.  Even in England and Scotland,
this inverse relationship between private gun ownership and violent crime
can be demonstrated, according to Colin Greenwood, retired chief of the
West Yorkshire Constabulary and criminology researcher since the sixties.
The explanation for this phenomenon is simple.  Most people are not
mentally unbalanced, or violent criminals, and therefore are capable of
safe and responsible gun ownership.  I had a gun when my wife told me that
she was having an affair with one of her co-workers.  By your theory, my
wife should be dead.  However, she remains in good health, we communicate
frequently, and are currently working on a reconciliation.  Why?  Because I
(and most other people) have sufficient moral fortitude to reject the idea
of committing murder for foolish reasons.  I am not a lunatic, therefore I
do not behave like one.
When the general population is armed, especially if they are armed during
their daily activities, the life of muggers, rapists, and murderers becomes
extremely dangerous.  People who insist on staying in these professions are
quickly removed from the gene pool by natural selection, and the smarter
ones gravitate to less dangerous professions, thereby reducing the crime
rate in two separate ways.  Even if only 10% of the population is carrying,
the 1% or less that is still outgunned by a factor of 10 or more, and only
fools play those odds.
The US has a higher rate of murder by strangulation than does the UK.
Would you argue that Americans posess more hands than their British
We already have more social programs than we can afford--they are a large
part of the problem.  Why would a 19 year old work for minimum wage at an
entry-level job when he can get on walfare and get better benefits than he
would from the job, and thereby have the time to make $1000 per night
selling crack.

One of the decay products of tritium (half-life: 12.5 years) is Helium-3,
which aggressively absorbs neutrons and poisons the fission reaction of the
plutonium.  If one has access to more tritium, which is commercially
available for about US $50,000 per gram, the existing tritium can be
purified and combined with the new tritium to bring the bomb back to full

This is not quite correct.  I can't seem to find my Commodore 128
Programmer's Reference Guide, (of all the things I lost going to the PC, I
miss my PRG the most.  It contains complete BASIC & assembler language
reference guides, lists EVERY memory address used by the OS and what it
does, register-level programming info on every chip, and even schematics
for my 128!  Unfortunately, nobody seems to publish such a book for PC's,
but I digress.)  The branching instructions used 1 byte for the in
struction, followed by 1 data byte which was a signed integer.  This
allowed one to branch up to 127 bytes ahead, or 128 bytes back from the
current instruction address register value.  The coolest thing about this
was that if you were able write your code to branch and not JMP or JSR,
your code could be located anywhere in memory and it would work perfectly,
which was very useful when writing interrupt wedges that were supposed to
work on the C-64 and the C-128, or that could be loaded in various places
in memory.
This is where self-modifying code came in handy.  During initialization, a
self-mod routine would increment the addresses in the jump table so they
pointed to the proper addresses of the respective routines.
If I remember correctly, there were all of 5 or 10 bytes available for
"user programs", depending on which OS functions you were willing to break.

Great work, Adam!  Pursuant to some of the recent rants on cypherpunks, I
would like to see a proposal for a secret sharing mechanism that would
allow the recovery of a storage-only key with m of n shares in the event
that the passphrase to the storage key is unavailable, with the following
1. Secret-sharing should be strongly discouraged for signature and
communication keys, for obvious anti-GAK/GACK reasons.
2. The values of m and n should be definable by the generator of (or anyone
who knows the passphrase to) the storage key.
3. The sharing algorithm and format of the share packets should be
standardised, so that any open-pgp compliant application can recover the
storage key without a passphrase, given the key and a sufficient number of
valid shares.

the same money, I could purchase a 40 acre woodlot with a stream running

Absolutely not!  Do I need some kind of government handout to save me from

A Cypherpunk To Be Named Later purchases a new hunting rifle and moves to
Alaska to try it out bear hunting.  After a few days of hunting, he sees a
moderately decent-sized black bear, and with one perfectly placed shot,
kills it.  Unfortunately, while watching the black bear collapse, he feels
a tap on his shoulder; turning around, he sees a large brown bear.  "I saw
what you just did," says the bear.  "You have two choices.  Either I maul
you to death, or you and I can step behind that rock over there and engage
in the sort of activity Vulis usually attributes to Timmy Mayonnaise."
Reluctantly, the Cypherpunk accepts the second alternative.
Several days later, when the Cypherpunk is sufficiently recovered to sit
comfortably, he decides to avenge his honor.  After several hours of
stalking, he centers the cross hairs of his riflescope on the brown bear's
[deleted] and fires.  While watching the brown bear die a slow and
agonizing death, he feels a tap on the shoulder.  Turning around, the
Cypherpunk sees an enormous grizzly bear.  "I saw what you just did," says
the grizzly.  "You have two choices.  Either I eat you alive, or you and I
can step behind that tree over there and I will show you what New York City
Police officers really carry batons for."  Reluctantly, the Cypherpunk
accepts the second alternative.
Several weeks later, after the bleeding stops and his toilet schedule
returns to normal, the Cypherpunk once again enters the woods, this time
seeking the grizzly bear.  After searching for several days he finds the
grizzly bear and shoots him.  While he is cutting off the grizzly's

sees a gigantic polar bear.  The polar bear looks at him and says, "You
don't come out here for the hunting, do you?"

You are right, of course, to a point.  Criminal don't fear cops like
vampires fear wooden stakes, or like certain politicians /
three-letter-agencies fear and loathe private gun ownership, or like most
women fear most spiders and snakes.  However, most criminals do make some
effort to avoid committing crimes in the presence of law enforcement
officers, and try to avoid capture and incarceration by same.  (Those who
don't, appear on "America's Dumbest Criminals" or White House press
briefings, I forget which...)
On the other hand, a homeowner with a 12-gauge riot shotgun or a Desert
Eagle .44 Magnum pistol can instill fear into almost any criminal, even the
stupid ones.  (The only thing I don't like about the Eagle is that a 75+
ounce pistol is rather difficult to conceal.  I have a shoulder holster for
mine, and I have to carry four magazines on the off side so I don't walk

that it doesn't jam, and you can hit anything with it.

BTW, in the vicinity of the I-80/I-680 interchange there are an array of
things suspended over the freeway that look like the sensors from metal
detectors, except they are about the size and shape of fluorescent light
fixtures.  They are opaque white plastic, suspended horizontally, with the
long axis crossing the lanu over which it is hung.  There is a cable
entering them at the top, and are suspended over all lanes of traffic
(except the fast lane) in both directions, as well as the on/off-ramps to
I-680.  Directly underneath them are sensor loops similar to what you might
find by traffic lights downtown.  The poles from from which they are hung
have 18-24 inch dish antennas, which point to the CHP truck scales which
are about 1 mile down the road from each sensor array.  Does anyone have
any idea what the devil these things are?  I have been trying to find

The excuse used by the government to justify regulation of firearms and
cryptography is one of crime prevention:
* "We can't let people have machine guns--they might go wacko and shoot a
whole bunch of people."
* "We can't let people have rifles or pistols with magazines that hold more
than 10 rounds--they might go wacko and shoot a whole bunch of people."
* "We can't let people have sawed-off shotguns--they are too easy to
conceal.  Someone might be able to hide one under their coat and then rob a
convenience store.
* "We can't let people have Nigger Town Saturday Night Specials--they are
too easy to conceal.  Someone might be able to hide one under their coat
and then mug somebody."
(This is the original, unabridged version of the term--the sanitized
version is just more acceptable to the public.  Some of the first gun
control laws in the US were passed to prevent black people from defending
themselves against the KKK, shortly after the Civil War.)
* "If we let people communicate using encryption, then terrorists and
pedophiles will be able to run amok."
This logic sounds good on the surface, but unfortunately it has a serious
flaw.  Like the difficulty with the old Mafia "protection" rackets, the
problem becomes "Who will protect us from the protector?"  Government has a
legitimate role in capturing and punishing those who harm others.  However,
when government attempts to prevent people from harming themselves or
others, the "cure" becomes worse than the "disease".
One can apply this warped logic just as aptly to body parts as firearms or
cryptographic software.  Women can use their bodies to solicit sexual
services (prostitution), and spread sexually transmitted diseases.  Should
we require them to license their breasts?  (Anyone C-cup or larger must pay
a $75 annual license fee per breast, D-cup or larger, $100.  Flat-chested
women will have to pay $150 for their concealable "Saturday Night
Specials", and of course carrying a concealed breast is a felony.)  Men can
commit crimes with their penises--rape, incest, sodomy, etc.  Shall we
license penises, too?  ($25 annually per erect inch, and any "assault
penis" capable of ejaculating more than once per erection will be
immediately confiscated.)
"Honey, Junior and I are going to go to the range, so I can teach him how
to shoot safely."
"You know I don't like guns, especially that one you have that looks like
an Uzi.  I just don't think it's right for Junior to be around such things.
 Besides, shooting is dangerous."
"Guns aren't dangerous, as long as you follow the appropriate safety rules
when handling them.  That is what I am going to teach Junior today."
"But I don't want Junior to be around guns.  You have all the equipment you
need to be a bank robber or terrorist, and that bothers me."
"Well, you have all the equipment you need to be a whore.  Should that
bother me?"
Prohibition was an attempt to prevent people from hurting themselves or
others due to excessive alcohol consumption.  Agents of the government
arrested those involved in the production and sale of alcoholic beverages.
Since government cannot change people's desires, the demand for the
consumption of alcohol remained.  Organized crime moved in to supply the
demand, and instead of saving lives, Prohibition cost lives--and freedoms.
The drinkers continued to drink, and due to the gun battles that ensued
when the government tried to stop them, the government decided to outlaw
(for all but a privileged few) private ownership of machine guns.
This trend continues today.  Purveyors of crack cocaine, heroin, and
methamphetamines have replaced bartenders as the boogeymen.  "Assault
weapons" are constantly reviled in the media as the tools of drug dealers
and terrorist criminals.  The government continues to strip away our rights
because "it needs to in order to be able to fight the War On Drugs".
Drugs are the excuse for some of the most onerous asset-forfeiture laws in
the civilized world--right here in the USA.  If police suspect (they don't
need any proof) that you are involved in drug trafficking, your house, car,
bank accounts, and other valuables can be confiscated.  They do not need to
be returned, even if you are never even charged with any crime.  (My source
for this: ABC's "20/20" news show, which is hardly a bastion of right-wing
As I write this, the House of Representatives is working on a bill that
effectively criminalizes electronic communication that does not provide a
transcript of the communication to the government.  The justification for
this Orwellian intrusion is terrorism, drug trafficking, child pornography,
money laundering, and various and sundry classified and therefore
unspecified "threats to national security".  Of course, the justification
is utter hogwash.
Instead of teenage hackers intercepting financial communications and
emptying our bank accounts, it can be done by professionals whose salaries
are paid by our taxes.  Instead of a few crackheads trying to break into
your house looking for cash or valuables to fund their next fix (a
situation created by our ridiculous War On Drugs), you can be assaulted by
your friendly neighborhood SWAT team searching for your unescrowed
encryption keys, equipped with eveything up to and including tanks and
armored personnel carriers, which you have the privilege of paying for out
of your pocket.
The source code for crypto isn't going to evaporate just because 536
politicians pass a law.  People still own machine guns, which in addition
to being illegal, are expensive to purchase, difficult to manufacture, and
difficult to hide from determined searchers.  On the other hand, the source
code for PGP and other cryptographic software is readily available, and
very easy to copy and redistribute, so even if house-to-house searches are
conducted, there will be tens of thousands of sources for it.  I suspect
that Crypto Prohibition will enjoy even less popular support than the
original did.

The process that brought Hitler is very similar to what is happening in the
US today.
1. All guns had to be registered. (much of this work was done by Hitler's
predecessors, but it made his job much easier.)
2. Abortion was made available on demand.
3. Euthanasia was made available for the terminally ill, then encouraged
for the elderly and feeble-minded.
4. Privately owned guns were confiscated. Freedom of speech and press was
5. Euthanasia gradually began to be applied to Communists, labor union
organizers, Jews, homosexuals, religious leaders, and anyone else who
opposed the government, eventually requiring the death camps to process all
those requiring euthanizatrion.
Most Germans didn't wake up to the situation until it was too late. Martin
Neimoller's quote "...and when they came for me, I couldn't say anything,
because there was nobody left to speak for me" (paraphrased) is one of the
most damning indictments of the sheeplike tendencies of most people. At
this time, we are working on steps 3 and 4 in the US.
Of course, this fundamental truth is not taught in public schools anymore,
the better to condition the populace to embrace step 5. You have to be one
of those home-school nuts or be able to afford a good private school to
learn _real_ history.
Obviously, Big Brother cannot propagandize "We hate strong crypto, because
anonymous e-cash allows people to untraceably move funds anywhere in the

Actually, in many jurisdictions, flame-throwers are NOT illegal. Legally
defining the difference between a "flamethrower", an "acetylene torch", a
"cigarette lighter" a "portable gas grill", and various other common
fire-producing items is even stickier than legally defining an "assault
weapon" or a "Saturday night special". Besides, flamethrowers are not yet
the weapon of choice for drug dealers, terrorists, child pornographers, and
muggers, so most otherwise anti-2nd amendment legislators haven't thought
to make them illegal. (Ever hear of a drive-by flamethrowing?)
Besides, you can make your own flamethrower out of a push-button butane
lighter (the kind that makes a spark to light the butane) and one of those
pump-up pressure sprayers available at Home Depot or Sears, as long as it
has a metal wand/nozzle assembly. All you need to do is attach the lighter
to the wand in a manner that prevents liquid from the nozzle from dripping
on your hand, drill the nozzle out so it produces a stream instead of a
mist, and fill the sprayer up with gasoline. Pump it up, and you have an
untraceable (if you buy the materials with cash) short-range riot
suppression tool for less than $30, including the gasoline to fill it.
If you want to get really nasty, mix some styrofoam in with the gasoline so
it starts becoming sticky. (Can you say napalm?) Of course, making the
gasoline too viscous will reduce its ability to be sprayed, so experiment
before using in a critical situation to determine the optimum balance
between desired burn characteristics and sprayability.
The above information is presented for educational purposes only. It is not
intended as legal advice, consult the local authorities before constructing
your flamethrower. IANAL. Misuse of the preceding information can result in
death or serious injury. "Fire is cool, Beavis." "Yeah, uh, cool, huhuhuhuh."

CoolEdit's noise reduction filter is great for removing tape hiss and other

sound like a cheap CD player) but it would obviously destroy any stegoed

my 586/133 about an hour to NR a 3 minute stereo 44 KHz recording, but I'm

stego data without taking as long.

It is my understanding that this is a setting to force 4.5 to encrypt all
messages to a specified key, which would be the corporate "message
recovery" key.  PGP 5.0 has a similar feature--a check box labeled "always
decrypt to default key" in the settings.  When this box is checked, the
default public key (usually one of yours) will always appear in the
recipient list when encrypting a message.  In 5.0, the default key is
visible in the recipient list, and it can easily be remived via drag and
drop.  I think that 4.5.x didn't show the key, and didn't allow the user to
remove it.

that a round cannot be chambered with the safety on.  If the weapon is not
cocked, the hammer hits the top of the sear (which is locked by the safety)
and prevents the bolt from traveling more than 1 inch to the rear.  If the
weapon is cocked, the charging handle on the side of the bolt hits the
front of the safety lever, which stops the rearward travel of the bolt at
about 2.5 inches, which is not sufficient to chamber a round.  The magazine
can be inserted or removed regardless of the position of the safety or the
On my Winchester 1300 Defender 12-gauge, (a pump gun with a 7-round
magazine) the safety cannot be engaged until the weapon has been cocked,
which requires the action to be cycled.  This will chamber a round unless
the magazine is empty.
On my Norinco Model 320 carbine (a semi-auto only Uzi lookalike) if the
weapon is not cocked, and the grip safety is not depressed, the bolt is
locked in the forward position, which makes it rather difficult to chamber
a round.  However, the safe/fire selector (the sliding button on the left
side of the grip) has no effect on the bolt.  Neither safety has any effect
on inserting or removing a magazine.
One of the oddities of the SKS is that a magazine cannot be inserted or
removed unless the bolt is locked in the rearmost position.  The sides of
the bolt have grooves machined in them that the lips of the magazine occupy
when the bolt is forward.  This can make changing a half-full magazine kind
of annoying.

InfoWar has always been a critical component of MeatWar.  Knowing who your
enemy is and where he is at makes it much easier to do something about him.
 Intelligence (in the military sense) and the tools to deny it to your
enemy (strong crypto) are of equal importance to weapons.  If you know that
a homicidal Postal Service employee is standing outside your front door and
is preparing to blast it off its hinges and then kill you, this
intelligence will do nothing but raise your blood pressure if you have no
weapons with which to deal with the situation.  (Calling 911 isn't going to
help you much.)  If you own several "assault weapons", but are asleep in
the living room when the door comes crashing down, the lack of intel will
greatly reduce the effectiveness of said weapons.
I have an equation for this:  Effectiveness = Intelligence * Force * Will. I define force as the theoretical ability to inflict damage on an opponent,
whether via bad PR, propaganda, lethal or nonlethal weapons, or any other
means.  Force has 2 components:  Materiel and Skill.  Thus, Force =
Materiel * Skill.  (Example:  If I own a riot shotgun and appropriate
ammunition, and have taken it to the range and familiarized myself with its
use, I have the theoretical ability to shoot the aforementioned Homicidal
Postal Employee, but mere ownership of the weapon and skill in its use does
not guarantee that outcome.)  Will is simply the will to fight if
Although government will always have a higher Force factor than an
individual or "the cypherpunks" or a militia, it can be possible to achieve
a higher Effectiveness score via higher Intelligence and/or Will factors. This is how we lost the war in Vietnam.  We had a much higher Force level
than the VC, comparable Intelligence levels, but a much lower Will ratio
(at least at the upper decision-making levels).  Because of this, our Force
assets were bound under all sorts of bizarre restrictions which hampered
their usefulness, and we ultimately left in defeat.
By disseminating a mechanism for increasing the Cypherpunks Force level
(the Assassination Politics essay) and annoying some IRS agents with a
stinkbomb, Jim Bell increased the government's Will to capture and
incarcerate him.  This is the problem with with terrorism in general (the
OKC bombing is a prime example).
If either Intelligence (the domain of crypto) or Force (the domain of
weapons) is zero, Effectiveness (the real-world ability to inflict damage
or defend yourself from damage) is also zero.  Ignoring either can be

Here is a way for an individual to make money using the eternity service:
1:  Users are charged $/MB/month to store data in the service.
2:  Users are charged $/MB for downloading data from the service.
3:  The source of a data item receives a portion of the download fees
collected for that item as an anonymous payment, or else the money could be
applied toward keeping the data on the service (the option of choice for
the really paranoid among us).
The location of the data should be determined by some sort of random
process, and it should move frequently.  Disallowing one to store one's own
data reduces the number possible locations for the data, and also requires
a mechanism for matching the source of the data to the owner of each node-
both of which are Really Bad Karma.
One could also construct a fee schedule where a higher rate would buy a
higher redundancy level for your data.
The eternity service should be its own remailer network--one that transfers
data as well as e-mail.  The nodes should have constant encrypted cover
traffic between them.
