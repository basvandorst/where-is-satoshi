    The difference being that in a system such as Sarad describes, if 'None of the above' gets more votes than any candidate, the election is declared void and a re-election is called (possibly excluding any of the candidates from the first round, depending on the details); hence, the 50% of the population who think 'they're all fvckers' have a reason to go to the polls.
    I've experienced such a system in action (within a student body) and it works well, provided you like your democracy to be loud and participatory.  For this reason it's unlikely to be implemented by an incumbent government, though I guess it's possible an uber-populist like Chavez or Lula might consider it.
