Kansas City, Missouri, actually (IIRC, natch).
The whole point, really, isn't so much about the Presidential race as it
is to try to elect the dead guy to Congress.
I can only wonder at the logic of this whole charade -- yeah, the lines
were a little long (I'm in a St. Louis 'burb, and I voted at 8 a.m.), but
that's pretty much par for the course.
(The ridiculous can o' worms that one opens up, if it turns out the late
Mel Carnahan wins his election, is one that I'd rather not deal with at
one in the morning. :)

This depends largely on whether your home is equipped with a
camcorder. Assuming it is, here's the instructions:
1. Get a piece of Scotch tape, and your copy of last month's WWF
Pay-Per-View that you foolishly bought. Put the tape over the little notch
on the end of the tape, so you can record over the TLC ("Tables, Ladders,
and Chairs") (oh my!) match.
2. Call up five of your friends (assuming one of your friends is Paul
Anderson and another one is Kurt Russell).
3. Get some guns. These should be easy to acquire. If you already have one
gun, you can use it to acquire more; this, however, is beyond the scope of
these Step By Step (TM) instructions.
4. Go to your local junkyard at night.
5. Have random people start shooting the guns at Kurt, while he mutters
and grunts but doesn't say anything. Have Paul point the camera at random
There you go. You've just re-created the bomb "Soldier."
HTH. HAND.

@_subject: lawyerpunks-in-training...? [OT?] 
This is a fairly big list, and there aren't very many lawyerpunks on it.
(And they all seem to be tied up arguing with Choate. :-)
For a host of reasons only peripherally related to things like CJ, Jim
Bell, my own brief experience running a remailer, et cetera, I've begun to
seriously consider law school.
If nothing else, it's a great way to defer paying on those student loans
for another few years...
So, in vaguely-random order:
* How does one decide whether law school is what they want to do? In a
  broader sense, how do you decide whether you want to be a lawyer when
  you grow up? The lawyers on the list are definitely encouraged to respond.
* Is there really a need for technically-inclined lawyers? In my far-from-
  expert opinion, there seems to be a shortage of them... After I'm done,
  will I still be able to afford Ramen? (Bear in mind that I have no
  interest in becoming an ambulance-chaser. Not gonna go there.)
* How will my undergraduate studies come back to haunt me? (My overall GPA
  was good but not great, and my Bachelor's is in computer science,
  instead of a more traditional prelaw field.)
* Recommendations of lawyerpunk-friendly law schools?

@_subject: What is the recommended variant of PGP. 
The short version is this: GPG will work more-or-less transparently with
PGP 5.x and 6.x, at least for all versions I've played with (most of 'em).
It won't play nicely with PGP 2.6.x (or, AFAIK, any older version).

@_subject: Phillip Morris ID database? 
As I understand it, things like this are part of the Great Big Settlement
the tobacco corps made with a whole lot of Attorneys General (30-some-odd
states, IIRC). Every few months, PM sends me a big pack of coupons
(usually in the $5-$10 off a carton range) and asks for a fresh copy of my
ID. Brown & Williamson does the same thing.
Also, if you find a bar/nightclub that's hosting an event sponsored by one
of those same corps, they usually have a scanner or copier present as
well, with similar gimmicks (give us a Xerox of your ID, get free stuff).
Thus far, the only things that have come from it is an increase in *weird*
junk mail (Marlboro's sponsoring some kind of nationwide chili cook-off,
so they sent me a spoon) and cigarette coupons. The standard "having your
name in a database" caveats apply, though PM at least seems mostly
interested in verifying that you're over 21. (All the paper forms I've
seen expressly tell you to blackout your SSN/DL.)
