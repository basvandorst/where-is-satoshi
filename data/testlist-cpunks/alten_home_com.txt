This is yet another a good example of why one should never confuse using PK certificates with security.  An email PGP signature looks impressive but in
practice it is useless.

PK Unfortunately the "if" is false.  I have no idea if your fancy PK signature really represents you.  Just look at the recent trouble Black Unicorn has had with someone else using the same name affiliated with a key stored on the Network Associates PGP key server. Dave could not verify a PK signature for the PGP software distribution itself.  PKI, or a web of trust, looks good on paper but in practice it does not work when scaled up to large numbers of networked users.

Richard and others,
Please stop.  This thread does not belong on the coderpunks mailing list.  If you want to argue
about BXA vs GPL please take it elsewhere.

@_subject: I'm looking for FSE2001 proceedings 
Does anyone know where I could purchase or get the papers submitted
to the Fast Software Encryption Workshop 2001?  Springer-Verlag
does not have it available for purchase yet.  I looked at the Web site (url below) and emailed the 2 Japanese fellows apparently
running it but they have yet to respond.  Any pointers or help
would be most appreciated.  I'm cc'ing cyperpunks and cryptography
mailing lists as well.
