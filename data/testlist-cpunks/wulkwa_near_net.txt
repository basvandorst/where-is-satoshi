I think it's important to realize that organizations move on a slower
time scale than people.  The larger the organization, the longer the
time scale.  Thus, when looking at the government's response to
anonymous transactions it would be wise to look at trends dating back
to the '70s (if not earlier).  Also, it's important to realize that
such long-term activities are systemic in nature.
Examples of government attacks on anonymous activities might include
the war on drugs (especially the money laundering countermeasures).
