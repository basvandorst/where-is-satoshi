^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    This explains far more of the rhetoric on this mailing list than
anything I could possibly write:  the young libertarians having lived
their teenage years alone in their bedrooms listening to heavy metal
music or Rush or Sisters of Mercy through headphones in order to not
disturb their fathers and masturbating looking at porno pics and
imagining the chicks think just like Ayn Rand have now reached the adult
stage in which they don't have to use headphones, they can admit they
hate their father, they don't have to pay taxes, and they can spend most
of their lives in front of a computer.

w.. by Michael Loomis at andrew.cm I can confirm this. Michael and I have had many an argument about taxes.
I tend to approach the argument from a libertarian perspective.
He, on the other hand, thinks the current tax setup is just about right,
and is a fan of the IRS.
Not kidding,
