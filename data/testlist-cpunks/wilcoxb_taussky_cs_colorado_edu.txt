   Uncle Sam Needed for Net Security
   picture
   By Anne Knowles
          November 29, 1995, 12 p.m. PT
          BOSTON--Getting the government involved in maintaining
Internet data privacy may not be popular, but it's going to be
necessary. That's the message Netscape Communications chair Jim
Clark delivered this morning in his keynote address to an audience
here at Email World and Internet Expo.
          To secure Net communications, the government will need to
have access to private data exchanges using what is known as a key
escrow security system, said Clark. He added that an invincible
security system for the Net is possible, but such a system
won't be built unless the government has a stake in it. "That's
where key escrow comes in," said Clark.
          Key escrow is a controversial security system advocated by
the Clinton administration that gives the government access to
private Net communications. It uses public key cryptography, a
system in which messages are coded and decoded using a set of
private and public keys. In key escrow, the private key is held
by both the individual or group and the government. The
government can use the key ostensibly to read messages for
intelligence and national security reasons.
          Currently the U.S. government restricts export of strong
keys in excess of 40 bits so it can break the code if necessary. The
weaker keys, however, make the messages vulnerable to other
attacks as well. A group of French scientists, for example,
cracked Netscape software using 40-bit keys by employing a
network of supercomputers over the course of a week. According
to Clark, though, restricting the export of stronger software
isn't the answer. "That's the wrong solution; we need
bulletproof keys."
          Netscape's stock price soared $20 yesterday based on a buy
recommendation by Goldman Sachs. The stock continues to climb
today: the share price is up $9 to $140. Clark said Netscape is
trying to keep pace with everyone's expectations. "The Internet
is a gargantuan opportunity, but it's up to us to take advantage of
          Expect to see more fluctuations. Said Steve Weiss, a
principal at Product Management Group in San Francisco, "Anything like
this that is so closely allied to wishes, bets, and beliefs is likely
to move up and down quite a bit." The run up is a reflection of the
promise the Internet holds for investors.  After all, added Weiss,
"the stock market is the mirror of the soul of the Internet."

@_subject: My conception of the ideal encryption tool for the masses 
Yes, but even if your PGP passphrase is "pass", using
PGP gives you excellent security against anyone who
can't get access to your secret key.
I envision "Joe User" security as a pocket-computer That has very limited capability.  Basically it can
input data (but not executable code!), put Joe's authentication-stamp (a.k.a. "signature", although that's a misnomer) on that data, and output it.
It only does this in response to some kind of
authentication-action from Joe himself.  Perhaps he
inputs a 4-digit PIN.  (It should be designed so that
he can keep the PIN-input-device out of sight, say in
his pocket, while using it.)  Furthermore it should
have an amnesia function where brute-forcing the PIN
fails (possibly wiping the secret key) and a duress
code PIN which fakes normal operation.  (Possibly the duress code replaces all the incoming data with "HELP I'M BEING HELD UNDER DURESS!" before stamping it and
outputting it, then wipes the secret key and continues
to operate in fake mode.)
And of course its hardware should be "tamper-resistant"
for whatever that's worth.
I guess it should have a one-time function (burnable
ROM or whatever) which generates the secret key so that
Joe can generate the key himself rather than having it
done at the factory.  It would be nice if Joe could
make a back-up of his secret key, but I don't see
anyway to do that without weakening the protection on
Does this sound like something Joe could learn how to
use properly, and trust enough to store a few hundred dollars in?  He can choose his PIN himself and his duress PIN can be a variation of the normal one.  One
problem is that Joe can't necessarily tell what
information is being fed into his "stamper" to be
stamped.  Possibly it could have an LCD display for
that purpose...
Hopefully it is apparent what kind of use this tool can
be put to.  For example, Joe picks up a a carton of
milk at the grocery store, the store's cash register submits a bill for $2.00 to Joe's stamper, which stamps it, and Joe leaves.  The grocer can submit Joe's signed
IOU to Joe's bank at his/her leisure later.
Variations on this theme.  The main issue is how Joe can keep track of what information his is stamping.

@_subject: Usability of Cryptography (was Re: More FUD from First Virtual) 
***********************************************************************
  ***************************************************************
I'm glad that you are willing to state this opinion,
Nathaniel, and take the flack that you are taking.  I think
that as the goals of cypherpunkism (e I just invented a
new "ism"...) *really* pertain to the *use* of cryptography by
large groups of people-- and not merely to the mathematical
details of cryptography-- that this issue is going to become
overwhelmingly important in the very near future.
I challenge you, however, to go beyond pointing this problem
out and start suggesting some approaches to alleviating it.
With your experience in doing security for a successful Internet transaction system, I would hope that you have valuable insights which can benefit all of us.
To get to the point, I want to know if this "fundamental tradeoff" that you refer to is in fact *fundamental*.  That is
to say: is the product of the "security factor" and the
"usability factor" a constant?  Or are there methods which can
be practically implemented to make strong cryptography easier
for Joe Average to use without exposing Joe to unnecessary
I'm sure in a trivial sense that there are some such methods.  For example (to pick on everyone's favorite crypto-for-the-masses), if PGP v1 and v2 had come in a nice
menu-oriented shell, or with a nice API, then a hell of a lot
more people would be using PGP now, and without reducing its
effectiveness as far as I can see.  I'm sure that the PGP
guys are aware of this problem, and I am looking forward (as
I'm sure many of us are) to PGP v3 with much anticipation.
But this kind of gooey "user friendliness" is not sufficient to make crypto *really* convenient to learn and to use, nor is it sufficient to make Joe Average's use of crypto really secure.  (Note the extreme sparsity of the current PGP Web O Trust, and the oft-lamented weakness of Joe's passphrase.)
I have made a clumsy first shot at envisioning the kind of
strong, convenient crypto that could perhaps bring the capabilities that we talk about here to the masses.  I submitted this article to cpunks last week entitled "My
conception of the ideal encryption tool for the masses", and it was picked up Robert Hettinga and echoed to his e$pam list.  Unfortunately I have not received a single response to this article either in personal mail or in public.  Was my article so poorly written?  Or are the cpunks failing to realize the importance of the usability/security issue?
I sincerely hope that Nathaniel and others can make progress
in addressing this issue.  Ultimately it will be as important as any issue in cryptography.
P.S.  I just went and re-read "My conception of the ideal
encryption tool for the masses" and I think I failed to make
something clear.  The crypto device that I envision is *not*
just useful for buying a pack of cigarettes at the grocery
store.  I could imagine it being used for *every*
user-authentication purpose.  You sit down at a terminal, plug
your pocket-crypto-box into it, and read your private e-mail.  You walk into a secure building, pass your pocket-crypto-box in front of the infra-red IO device, and the door opens for
you.  You negotiate a million-cyber-credit deal, you plug
your pocket-c'box into the Net, and sign the contract.
Etc. etc.  In short, for the vast majority of your crypto
needs you depend *entirely* upon the pocket-c'box and not upon
passphrases and floppy disks.
P.P.S.  I am aware that this makes a physical attack upon your c'box into one of the few remaining viable attacks.  I recommend that everyone carries a handgun next to their pocket c'box.  Deadman switches, good police forces and other
physical security, etc. will also be important.  Since this
technology is empowering individuals, it is also increasing the value of loot than can be gained by robbing an individual.
Alley-bash the right person and you might be able to steal a
personal fortune.  Another issue that we who seek a better
future through technology need to address.
P.P.P.S.  I can see that there is a major problem with my idea regarding the IO between the pocket-c'box and the user.  Perhaps the pocket-c'box will have to come with trusted IO hardware (screen, keyboard, pointer-device, audio, vox-recog...  but I digress...).
P.P.P.P.S.  Also note that the pocket c'box should probably hold many of your pseudonyms (i.e., many of your pseudonyms' private keys) and your Chaumian pseudonym-exchangeable P.P.P.P.P.S.  Remember those under-$600.00 netstations?  Even if they don't pan out this year, they will soon.  And then they will move into our pockets, and into our wristwatches, etc etc.  The cypherpunks need to be ready to offer Joe a *secure* computer to put into his pocket, so that he is carrying new capabilities and renewed privacy in his pocket, rather than carrying a little chunk of Big signatures follow

Jiri Baum  wrote in private e-mail:
Yes, even such klooges such as Mondex might be considered a variation on my idea.  Ultimately, though, I expect this device to become my *only* interface with the Net.  I don't own any long-term storage device.  Instead I just rent it over the Net and encrypt any long-term data that I consider private.  I do any *sensitive* processing on the CPU in my handheld computer, but if it's a big job and I don't mind people watching then I rent a CPU over the Net to chew on it.
This device is perfectly portable and can be plugged into any Net jack in an office or telephone booth, or perhaps it can do wireless.  The important point is that no matter where I am physically, or what long-term storage device I am using via the Net, I have complete crypto security.  (Mod Tempest-
surveillance, physical subversion of my crypto box, etc.)  If it were done right I could use this same box for my notepad, wallet, e-mail agent, Web browser, game-player, etc. etc. etc.
Hm.  As often happens in these kinds of discussions, we've missed each other because of different semantic conventions or something.  My idea does not depend upon tamper-proof hardware in the sense that the owner must be prevented from cracking it open, but it *does* (as does every conceivable crypto system) depend on tamper-prevention in the sense that those antagonistic to the owner must be prevented from cracking open his box!
Also I haven't given up anonymity at all.  Oh!  You mean in my
example of Joe paying at the grocery store.  Well he can have a
pseudonymous account at that store if he wants.  There is certainly no *necessity* to give up self-identity-control in any I thought about that but I personally wouldn't trust it.  It might fail to recognize my fingerprint at an important moment.  Besides, I hate the thought of a mugger taking my index finger also when he takes my wallet...

@_subject: POTP gets good press 
An entity calling itself "Simon Spero
 " is alleged to have written:
Sorry.  Here's what I originally said:
And here's what I meant:
The central theme of the article, from a 'technical' point
of view, was that in the past there have been two kinds of
encryption in use, which the author calls "Link Level
Encryption", in which the sender transmits his key to the
receiver, and "Packet Level Encryption", in which the sender
transmits is key to a certificate authority which transmits
them to multiple receivers.
Now for starters the network layer is really independent of
key-distribution schemes, as far as I can see.  So I don't
know why the diagrams showing the two schemes
(sender->recipient vs. certificate authority) are labelled
"Link Level" and "Packet Level".  But we haven't even gotten
to the good stuff:
"Synchronized Random Key Generation", which shows a single
sender and multiple recipients transmitting securely
*without* having to do any key management!  Yee haw!
100% pure unrefined snake oil.
Okay I think I've made my point to the Editor In Chief on
the industry rag in question.  Hopefully they'll be
conscientious enough to print a retraction, or perhaps run
an article about the hazards of snake oil in the info
security industry.  :-)

@_subject: ANNOUNCE (a cypherpunks exclusive!) 
I've added a couple of features to BAP (mainly being able to
quote an encrypted message that you are replying to, and a command-line interface for script-writers.) and called it v1.1 and I'm distributing the 1.1beta at  the Niche  for 20 cents payable in Mark Twain Bank Ecash.  If you are too
technologically backwards or miserly to pay 20 cents for
this then you can probably convince me to e-mail a copy.
BAP is "Bryce's Easy PGP"-- my own PGP<->Unix programs integrator script.  When I set out to write it, my goal was to make it easy enough to use that my mother could do so.  She does now, so I consider it a success!  Here is what some
other people have said about BAP:
   "Great job!  Much better than the hacked sendproc     I used to use with MH!"
           - Philip R. Moyer    "I've tried competing products and found this to be the     cleanest, smoothest and easiest to install.  I have no     personal, commercial or financial interest in this     product.  It does 'auto-pgp' for pine, elm and tin."
           - Henry W. Farkas    "So far, I've been absolutely _thrilled_ with BAP and how
    easily it integrates with both elm and trn.  As you can     see, I actually have it running on almost everything     I post or email from this site."
           - Alexander Williams    "I have just 'bought' copies of your bap_in and bap_out
    software, and I'm just letting you know so that you can     add me to your user list.
      You may be interested to know that this is the first     thing that I've found worthwhile 'buying' using     [cyberbuck trial] ecash since I joined the digicash     ecash scheme just after it started.  I've been wanting     to incorporate pgp into email (I use elm) for a while     now, and your software has enabled me to do so easily.      Good on you, keep up the good work."
           - Glen Pringle I'm not going to be available to work on BAP for a little
while so all the glaring security holes, uglies, crashing
errors and so forth that come with 1.1b1 are just going to
stay there for a week or two unless someone else fixes them.
People who give me complaints, bug reports and feature suggestions have the privilege of being added to the
"Hall of BAP Contributors" .   tag available upon
Oh yeah-- and I've marked down the price of "BAP classic"
(v1.0whatever) to US$0.50 for each piece.  Come and get 'em!
