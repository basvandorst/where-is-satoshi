PGP does violate patents.  Several people, particularly in the
cypherpunks community, are trying to alleviate the RSA vs. PGP
problem.  The controversy is counterproductive (and all sides seem to
be mostly good guys), so let's not stir the pot further.  Two of the
solutions are 1) PGP could be reimplemented to use RSAREF, and 2)
RSAREF (or something like it) could be extended to include all the
functionality of PGP, but without the patent problems.  (RSAREF is a
copyleft implementation of RSA stuff).
I encourage you to cease public promotion (because the RSA claim is
legit), and send a message to Jim asking him what you can do to
encourage a freely (and easily) useable and legal general encryption

It would be even nicer if this was done by someone outside the US.
This avoids the export problem.

@_subject: Lobbying for Cryptoprivacy, non-U.S. Non-U.S. citizens can lobby hard to get all phones containing key-escrow (aka wiretap) chips banned in your country.  You have a  very good argument: do y'all want Yankee spooks listening in on your  phone calls?  Make sure the following specifics are included in the  legislation: 
This is extremely dangerous.  Much of legislation is compromise.  Any
such bill is probably so close to a bill that outlaws cryptography (or
could be interpreted as a precedent for such a bill) that the risks
are probably far greater than the rewards.  The strategy the Eric
Hughes proposed sounds much better.

This is not intended as pressure.   Coudln't you argue with their
conclusion that it is unethical?  If they were to make such a claim,
it would certainly be a good opportunity to push them on the issue of
free speech.

Not at all.  It would merely prevent them from using those particular
anonymous remailers.  Still a problem, but much less of one.

Hardly insane.  If the rephrasing software were available for
Connection Machines and nothing else, then one would very much want a
remailing server that would rewrite phrases for you.  It'd be
wonderful if it worked on Joe Schmoe's 286 box, but it's pretty
Until it does, using such capabilities built into remailers would be
an improvement over the current situation.  Note that I'm not making any claims that the technology is possible
any time soon.

I would really like to know who the person is or why I can't be told.
Did they put pressure on you to keep it quiet?  Did they hold a gun to
your head?
This is impressive.

Let me rephrase: You took a long step towards providing true privacy
on the net and it worked so well that people wanted to stop you.
You've shut down, but come out of it with lots of experience with
running such a service, lots of good publicity (and some bad stuff),
lots of new uses to which people put that sort of anonymity to, and
some really good ideas for how to make these systems succeed
politically (the being very visible thing).  Though the outcome isn't
optimal, it sure sounds like an impressive success to me.
Now I hope you will follow up this experiment with a write-up to
document the things you learned (positive and negative), and your
recommendations on how to do the next one.
PS and if you can't tell us about the politics of the shutdown, I'm
sure there's someone else in the know that can publish it anonymously
so you won't have to :-)
