@_subject: [HacDC:Byzantium] Wi-fi range extension with phased pherical array antennae? 
Perhaps wi-fi range could be extended without increased power with spherical phased arrays of antennae, which can be used to directionally amplify sent and received signals. Maybe a physics or engineering student could put into the public domain hardware designs to control signal directionality of such an icosahedral array, and open source software could be devised to discover other signal's direction, and transpond 'in' that right direction with that signal's transponder. Here's some related papers:
