@_subject: True Lies and other wiretaps 
There's some pretty good bits of government abuse of wiretaps in
Arnold's newest mega-blockbuster, _True Lies_. (big abuses of
wiretaps really)  Apparently the terrorists in this movie must
use clipper because the "Omega Sector" (the government superspy
agency in the movie) decrypts some of the terrorist's files in
a matter of minutes. Probably just another bit of Cameron's humor,
because the movie is loaded with unlikely events which are hilarious.

@_subject: Come on 
Well, I can certainly say that I am impressed that you've progressed
to telepathy, but humor a poor student for once. Could it be that
H.E.A.T. is a low budget campy syndicated show with bad writing whose
only "redeeming" (gimmick) feature is the hunky guys and bodacious babes which
appear on it? Like 9 million similar shows on USA up-all-night.  I'm a
fan of the genre myself, only instead of H.E.A.T., I watch "Thunder in
Paradise" which has Hulk Hogan, a wonder speedboat, and Carol Alt in
it. You can't beat the ridiculous plots, impossible boat technology
(artificial intelligence, rocket powered *in water* at speeds that
would easily tear it apart, and cheesy morphing effects), and the way
Carol Alt seems to fall into the hands of the bad guy every week. (the
bad guy usually has a harem of women, or amazons from American
   Sandy may think that the women "know his heart is in the right
place", but that is a dangerous assumption to make, especially in a
professional setting where you aren't judgement proof. Let me tell you
what happened to my brother-in-law 2 weeks ago. He had just gotten
back from vacation in the Bahamas with my sister and was eager to show
his buddies at work(United Airlines) the pictures he had taken on the
beach. It just so happened that this beach had plenty beautiful women
in bikini's on it and he had taken many pictures of them. His buddies
made a few comments like "check out that one", "that one's a babe", etc.
One of the female coworkers overheard and filed sexual harrassment
charges. (she thought the pictures were pornographic, she hadn't seem
them).  He was punished and given a list of words and phrases you
can't say around the office, including stuff like, "you look different,
did you change something?" and "your hair looks nice today." The
point being, it doesn't matter what your intentions are, or if you
meant no harm by a comment, one sexist comment or mention of a woman's
body part, and in many workplaces, you could be in hot water.
 The key phrase is "perceptive women". There will always be one twit,
or group of twits, waiting to pounce on you. After experiencing
speech codes and feminist wackos on the U of MD campus, I'm not
going to underestimate the power of twits any more.
  Sandy's pretty safe making comments on this list because of the make up of the list (mostly male, many libertarian, many anti-pc, etc)
just as Tim May was safe making plenty of politically controversial
statements on Extropians. Try making those kinds of statements in a
more politically diverse forum. (and indeed, I believe Tim did eventually catch fire in the netcom newsgroups where someone mistook
one of his comments against welfare as bigotry)
  I hope I "got it"

@_subject: Cryptosplit 
The recent postings about crypto sharing/spliting programs
renewed my interest, so I dusted off cryptosplit (a Shamir
secret sharing program I wrote around November of last year)
and fixed up the bugs which made it unusable. Here it is,
less bugged, about 10 times faster than before, but still ugly.

XHow to use
XTo encode:
Xcsplit -g  -q  [filename]
Xtake filename and split it into the number of pieces given by -g. Each
Xpiece is "filename.0", "filename.1", ..., "filename.(n-1)" if
Xfilename isn't supplied, it operates like kinda like a filter taking the
Xincoming data and spliting it into files "piece.0", "piece.1", ...
Xto decode:
Xprovide atleast the number of pieces specified by -q when you encoded.
XIf you specify less than the minimum number, it will not decode.
Xcsplit -g 5 -q 3 file
X[split file into 5 pieces, any 3 of which will reconstruct it]
Xcsplit file.0 file.1 file.2
X[put them together in the decoded file and output to stdout]
Xif you want to put it into a file, redirect it using the shell, or
Xuse "-o filename"

Yours truly has been stung. Someone used rjc at powermail.com to create
