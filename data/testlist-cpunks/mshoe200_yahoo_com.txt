@_subject: a question 
I first want you to know I understand what you do but
I need to ask you to please remove the post from
I am only 16 and just wanted to get some money the
easy way at the time I had no idea that it was
illegal. I know I made a mistake and I am sorry for
it. I just want to put this mistake beind me and
getting my family's address off the internet would be
a big help. Please consider removing the postings.
Thank You, Mitch

@_subject: my name and address 
Every now and again I do a search of my name just to
see what comes up and I recently saw a post of my name
an address at this url
I was wondering if you could please erase this for two
reasons, one I do not live at that address anymore and
two I stopped sending the chain letter 3 months ago,
so there is no use for my personal information to be
on the net anymore. Thank-You
