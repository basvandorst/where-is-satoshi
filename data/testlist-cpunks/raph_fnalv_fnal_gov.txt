@_subject: WANTED: speakers on cryptography, etc. 
I'm talking about PGP to the Computing Dep't at Fermilab at Batavia,
Illinois where we have the largest particle accelerator in the
world (for  elemantary particle physics research). It will be Feb
22 at 2PM at the High Rise (Wilson Hall) here, in 1West. We are
open to the public, BTW. Yr all invited. We have all sort of events
and colloquia.  Batavia is about 30 miles west of Chicago, off I88.
Know anyone who could give a lecture on encryption? Hacking?
Cypherpunkiana? Security concerns? Clipper chips? I can get you a
lecture for the general public here, or for the 2000 or so
engineers, physicists and computer people here! We have lectures
and seminars for pop to esoteric topics. I'll help you spread the
word. I'm on a couple of committees here. We will be *delighted*
to find speakers.
BTW we had the US Dep't of Energy, Office of Counterintelligence
here last week talking about security. Their concern was 95%
smuggling commercially sensitive info from large companies to
foreign concerns via diplomats through their embassies to give them
an unfair advantage over us. Money talks.
(Please forward if you please to alt.security.pgp,
cypherpunks etc. I unsubbed from the latter due to the huge
volume of mail.)
Public key and phone by finger.
Cordially, Jim
