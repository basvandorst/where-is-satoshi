XML DevCon is a series of conferences designed to expose developers to
topical and timely information about enterprise XML and integration
Each event updates developers on key XML-related specifications and
technologies. The conferences provide instruction on designing documents
and programming with XML application programming interfaces (APIs).
The conferences also expose developers to XML application development using
technologies such as middleware, databases, scripting, messaging, content
aggregation, application servers, mobile computing, application-to-application
integration, and enterprise Java.
