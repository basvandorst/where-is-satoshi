Working on rolling that functionality out. I had to rewrite the app import
pipeline so that I could store that information. I have the data collected but
it isn't user facing yet. I can tell you that looking at the ~6,000 unique
certificates in the observatory data about 75% are RSA 1024.
As far as I'm aware it isn't possible to learn the key generation date from the
certificate data in the PKCS7 structure stored in the META-INF directory of an
Yeah, the current NIST[1] advice on key sizes is very clear that 1024 bit RSA
should be deprecated (though evidently NIST might not be an unbiased source of
The pubkey in the cert used for the core Guardian Properties (ChatSecure,
Obscuracam, etc) is definitely 1024 RSA. So is the pubkey in the cert used for
Orweb. It would definitely be a good idea to start talking about migration
plan, (and using a strong keysize in a new cert for all new properties)
