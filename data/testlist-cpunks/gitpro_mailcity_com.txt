Mako Capital shares to triple in next few months, projects research company!
Mako Capital intent to merge with Sports Group International and Spalding Sports Drinks worldwide.
OTC BB ï¿½ MAKO 3/4
What do Kiki Vandeweghe, Dorothy Hamill, Joe Namath, Bill Walton, Holmes and Clyde Drexler all have in common? They are all shareholders of a
dynamic sports drink company called Sports Group International
Mako Capital
On October 19, 1998 Mako Capital made a blockbuster announcement that was
obviously overlooked by the investment community. Mako signed a letter of
intent to merge with Sports Group International. Sports Group is a company with an experienced, proven management team. Sports Group revolutionary products in the multi-billion dollar sports drink We instantly fell in love with their oxygenated water. This is water with
seven times the oxygen of H20. It is a big hit with marathon runners and we
feel that there is a huge market for this product. They also have formulated sports drinks to satisfy every market. Sports drinks designed for
kids, women and bodybuilders. They also have powdered products.
The key to this company is that their sports drinks are marketed under the
Spalding name. Spalding is one of the most recognized names in sports. You
canï¿½t buy that type of name recognition. We are told that the company has
1.2 million cases pre-sold for 1999 which should bring in more than twenty
million in revenue and 15% in profit (approximately 3 million). That would
be better than one dollar per share in earnings. Sports Groups team is headed by Kiki Vandeweghe, the former NBA All Star and Dean Miller,
the star executive of Megafoods. As president of Megafoods, Dean saw the
company grow from a couple of stores to 70 stores and $800 million Realizing that much of the great success behind Gatorade was the campaign featuring Michael Jordan, SGI has procured promotions and
endorsements from athletes who are current shareholders like, Clyde Drexler,
Kiki Vanderweghe, Bill Walton, Larry Holmes, Joe Namath, Dorothy Hamill and
Mako Capital has the right combination of great products, a proven
management team and a name recognized around the world, which will lead them
into the next millenium. We are looking for the stock to trade $2 - $3 short
term and $5 - $7 by summer of 1999.
