@_subject: Private legal tender 
A simpler variation on what was suggested would go like this:
Customer sends cash or money order to digital bank, along with a floppy
with an anonymous email address (via a remailer) and a public key.  The
bank emails the customer encrypted digital cash corresponding to the
amount he sent in (minus any service charges).  If Chaum blinding is
used, the needed data can be included on the floppy.  Alternatives to
sending a floppy would be for the customer to email the same information
when he mailed his money, including some secret information with both
which would tie them together.
Customers spend money using the appropriate protocols.
When a customer wants, he can send his digital cash to the bank to get
it exchanged for new digital cash; or he can include with the digital
cash instructions to tell the bank to mail a check or money order to
a specified address.  Here is where he could use a postal mail drop if
he doesn't want to reveal his own identity (assuming he is mailing to
himself); or he may request mailing to some other business which doesn't
accept digital cash but from which he wants to purchase something.

I don't think the idea of a "virtual server" for anonymity will really
accomplish much.  Even if you somehow manage to spread the software over
several machines, you still need to publicize the entry and exit points
for remailing requests.  If the net police determine to shut down the
server, they can go after those machines which are publically known to
be the places where the anonymous messages come from and shut them down.
Sure, if you have a network of machines you might be able to bring another
one online pretty quickly to replace this one which has been shut down.
But then the net police can go after that one.  And so on.
You'd get the same effect just by having a bunch of conventional remailing
servers, only announcing one of them publically, and then having each
one come online only after the one before it got shut down.
The hard part in either of these scenarios is collecting more people who
will run anonymity servers.  I don't see that doing tricky stuff with
virtualizing the calculations helps you much.
Similarly, trying to put a machine at an unknown site, or perhaps in a
friendly country, won't necessarily help.  If the machine itself is
inaccessible, the net police will go after its feeds, the points at which
it connects into the network.  Look at what happened to Julf.  His machine
was safe, sitting in a back room of his house.  They went after his net
feeds instead.
The real answer is to publically defend remailers.  I argue for remailing
servers on the basis of preventing traffic analysis.  Most people accept
that the use of encryption is justified for email in order to protect
individual privacy.  I claim that remailing servers extend this protection
to include not only the content of a message, but its destination as well.
The net does little today to keep the facts private about whom you communicate
with.  Remailers provide that confidentiality.
If we had enough remailers that we could confidentally run a virtualized
system, knowing that we could keep brining them online faster than they
could be shut down, I'd argue that a better use of those resources would be
to publically identify all of the remailers and let them all operate on
their own.  This would provide a united front to oppose the anti-privacy
forces, giving political strength to our goals.

@_subject: REMAIL: X-TTL and X-Discard 
I don't see that X-TTL is very useful as currently proposed.  As I see
it, I would have to create something like this:
X-TTL: 5
Request-Remailing-To: remailer1
Request-Remailing-To: remailer2
Request-Remailing-To: remailer3
Request-Remailing-To: remailer4
Request-Remailing-To: remailer5
Dummy message to be sent.
(Or an equivalent structure could be set up with nested PGP encryptions.)
This would go through remailers 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, decrementing the
X-TTL field each time, and after the last one when it was 0 the message
would be deleted.  The X-TTL is not very convenient in this case since
you still have to come up with a path for sending your message which is
at least as long as the X-TTL value.
It seems to me that the X-Discard idea is simpler; you can just put the
X-Discard in the command block for the last remailer, and you don't have
to count them.
What is needed to make X-TTL useful is for the remailer to choose another
remailer as its destination, and ideally to encrypt the message before
sending it.  This way X-TTL can be used to insert a random remailer path of
n hops in the middle of a sender-constructed remailing path.  This leads to
a system where the remailer decrypts an incoming message, reads the X-TTL
value, decrements it, re-encrypts the message for the next remailer in the
chain, and sends it.  The X-TTL value is never exposed to outsiders.
At one point I wrote a modification to my remailer to cause it to
encrypt any message which it sent to another remailer which supported
PGP.  But I decided that this didn't really help security enough to
be worthwhile.  It would be much better to encourage users to encrypt
their messages themselves in a nested fashion so that no remailer sees
any more information than the bare minimum necessary.

@_subject: OTP dual decryption 
Using a one-time pad for dual decryption might work like this.
I have a file, D (for Dangerous), which I want to conceal.  I construct
a random file of the same length, K (for Key), which will be my "encryption
key".  I xor K and D to produce E (for Encrypted), the encrypted file.  I
delete D and hide K somewhere.
Now, in case an intruder steals E and coerces a decryption out of me, I
prepare S (for Safe), a file containing some safe plaintext.  I xor
S and E to produce F (for Fake), the fake key file I will be able to
present.  I destroy S and hide F somewhere, but perhaps not as securely as
I hid K.
Now, if the intruder comes, he finds E, the encrypted file.  He demands
the key, and I explain that the file was encrypted with a one-time pad,
and here is the key, and I provide him F.  He xor's F and E to find
S, the safe plaintext, and I am protected.
This is all well and fine, but it depends on successfully hiding K, the
actual key file.  But if you can successfully hide files, it seems to me
that you might as well have just hidden D, the dangerous file, in the
first place, in whatever hiding place you were going to use for K.  Then
substitute S, the safe file, for D.  This is just the old idea of
having two sets of books for a crooked business, one innocent and public
and one incriminating but hidden.
So I'm not sure the one-time pad idea really helps much since if you can
meet the requirements to use it you might as well just hide your data the
old-fashioned way.  Are there any advantages that I'm overlooking?

@_subject: Rivest evaluation of SecurID smart card 
I thought this might be of some interest to the CypherPunks list.
DEADBEAT - - - - - - - - - TO:	Kenneth P. Weiss, Chairman
FROM:	Ronald L. Rivest /initials RLR/
DATE:	April 7, 1987
RE:	Evaluation of SecurID Approach to User Identification
This memo provides a brief overall evaluation of your SecurID product,
as you have requested, suitable for limited distribution.  (It does not
contain any of the proprietary information you have disclosed to me.)
The SecurID card generates a pseudorandom sequence of displayed
numbers:  the displayed number us changed every 60 seconds.  The
sequence is "pseudorandom" rather than truly "random" in the sense that
it is generated by applying a (proprietary) algorithm and secret key to
a representation of the current time.  Thus, a host computer knowing
the algorithm and the secret key in the card can compute the number
displayed on the user's card at any moment.
Clearly, the numbers produced by such a card can be used in place of a
conventional "PIN" or "password" for access control or user
authentication, if the host is prepared to compute the number currently
displayed on the user's card.  That is, the user could enter the
displayed number instead of a remembered PIN or password when he is
asked to authenticate himself when initiating a login or financial
One can obtain additional security by first combining a user-remembered
PIN with the displayed number, so that the user is authenticated both
by "what he knows" as well as "what he possesses".  For example, if
both the displayed number and the user's PIN are decimal numbers, the
combining operation could be "add digit-by-digit without carry".  The
host computer, knowing both the user's PIN and the displayed number,
can compute the correct value for comparison.
1. An End-to-End Approach
One major advantage of your approach is that it is an "end-to-end"
technique: no intermediate nodes in the communication network are
entrusted with any security responsibilities.  The only places where
secret information needs to be maintained and manipulated are the
user's card and his host computer.
By contrast, an approach which encrypts PINs and transmits them in
encrypted form to the user's host computer may -- in a large, diverse,
multiorganization network -- require tremendous complexity in terms of
key management overhead and will necessitate a great deal of trust
between the participating organizations.
In my consulting work I have seen large organizations work very hard to
design "end-to-end" authentication protocols because of their
intrinsically greater security and simplicity.
2. Pseudo-random number generation
As noted above, your card generates a pseudo-random sequence of numbers
by applying a proprietary algorithm to a secret key and the current
time (measured to the minute).  The secret key is known only by the
user's card and host computer.
The system could be compromised if an "enemy" could predict future
numbers to be displayed by the card, from past observed values.  (These
numbers are transmitted in the clear, and are not encrypted.  This
makes your approach valuable for logging in from a "dumb" terminal, but
makes it possible for a wiretapper to obtain a set of previously values
produced by the card.)
However, I do not believe this attack can be successfully mounted
against your system.   I have tried to "break" your system in this
manner, without success.  The proprietary algorithm (which you have
disclosed to me) is based on sound cryptographic principles; it is
likely that the best approach to "breaking" this system is a
brute-force search for the secret key.  Since the secret key you use is
longer than that used by DES, I believe that this approach is
infeasible in practice.
(I should note that while my examination of your algorithm was
intensive and covered all aspects of the algorithm, it was of necessity
an examination of limited duration.  Some of your customers, such as
those involved with matters of national security, will certainly want
to see your algorithm subjected to additional intensive scutiny [sic]
before adopting it for use.)
Thus, I believe the sequence of numbers produced by your card will be
unpredictable by an "enemy", even if he sees previously produced
numbers.  Therefore:
   o    The ability to produce the number that is correct for the
   o    The numbers produced do not need to be encrypted, since
Of course, other cryptographic algorithms could be used to produce the
pseudo-random number sequence from the secret key and the current
time.  For example, one could use DES.  (Given recent events, the
algorithms should perhaps be called "ODES" for the _Old_ Data
Encryption Standard".)  However, given the shorter key length and
greater implementation cost of DES, I don't see any advantage here
other than that it is (or was) a standard that withstood at one time a
careful review.  (This, however, may be significant to some of your
customers.) It is also perhaps worth noting that your algorithm, while
easier to implement than DES, is more computation-intensive than DES,
making a brute-force search substantially more difficult to mount.
3. Combining operations
Additional security can be obtained by combining the displayed number
with a user-remembered PIN, say by adding them digit-wise with carries
While this combining operation is very simple, it is easy to prove that
if the displayed number sequence is unpredictable, then adding a PIN to
the sequence won't change this fact.
Furthermore, the PIN itself is protected from disclosure, unless the
"enemy" can obtain both the current displayed value and the value after
the PIN has been added.  However, to obtain the first requires access
to the card, and to obtain the second requires wiretapping; these are
not likely to be simultaneously available.  (The risk here seems less
than the risk that the keyboard is tapped in a conventional password
scheme.)  A similar analysis applies to using the displayed number
sequence to "encrypt" values other that the PIN; this operation should
provide the desired security.
The approach used in your SecurID product is novel, and offers security
advantages over conventional PIN or password schemes.  The
cryptographic algorithm employed should provide a high degree of

@_subject: WANTED:  List of very reliable remailers 
I've been experimenting with the remailers lately, and I've been
trying to put together all the tools I'll need to start sending
most of my email through them.  Towards this end, I wrote a
simple program called CRM that adds forwarding tags, and calls
PGP to do multiple encryptions, and then wraps the result in a
In what is starting to look to me like a design flaw, I set the
program up to pick a random chain of a specified length out of a
set of remailers.  All of this talk about remailer reliability
has got me a little bit spooked, because I don't have any way of
knowing if my mail is going through or not.
I'd like to configure my remailer's utility so that it only uses
a small list of *very* reliable remailers, preferably with each
entry on the list being run by a distinct person.
Are there any remailers which:
o    Support PGP encryption?
o    Have been in reliable operation for a significant period of
     time (at least a couple of months)?
o    Are maintained by someone who knows enough about the
     software to prevent it from crashing?
o    Don't introduce significant delays in the remailing?      (Unless, of course, they are using some sort of scheme to
     frustrate traffic analysis.)
                               and
o    Are set up on systems over which the remailer's
     administrator has enough clout to prevent a summary shutdown
     without at least giving a couple of days' notice?
I'm assuming (for no very good reason) that Hal Finney's sites
fit these criterium.  If that's true, then strictly speaking, I'd
only need one other similar site run by another person, although
I'd feel better if I was using a chain through three remailers. Obviously, the more remailers I have on the list, the better off
I am.  But I'd rather have a small list of highly reliable
remailers than a larger list than contains even a single marginal

worried about the post reporting dropped mail from the jarthur

@_subject: A question about pasting 
This probably a naive question, but:
Is there any way, using a remailer, to paste something into the
header that will provide a return address (different from the
reamiler's) that can be recognized by a garden variety unix mail
Because it seems to me that if it is, then it would be possible
to set up a mail forwarding site that would work in the following
1.   A user would send in and register, possibly (preferably) via
     a remailer chain, a public-key and a remailer return
     address.  A remailer return address would be a PGP encrypted
     command bundled with a remailer address;  the PGP command
     would cause the remailer to forward the mail to the user
     through a chain of remailers.
2.   These would be stored under an alias, either user-defined or
     automatically allocated (like anon.penet.fi).
3.   Once registered, the server would send encrypted mail back
     to the user via the chain, and request that the user take
     some specific action (ie., send mail with the a random ten
     character string in the subject line, or whatever) to verify
     the address.  This would prevent people from creating
     anonymous identities that forwarded mail to someone else.
4.   Once the identity was registered and confirmed, then
     whenever mail is sent to that address, the forwarder will
     encrypt it with the public key and use the remailer chain to
     forward the mail.  The identity of the person sending mail
     to the alias and the subject line would be buried in the
     cyhpertext.
5.   The server will also make the public key of all identities
     available via a mail request, so that signatures can be
     verified by people who want to do that.
The whole point of this is that it would then be possible to have
mail that's very secure (except for traffic analysis).  You could
use PGP encrypted outgoing mail to everyone, even people who
don't know or care about remailers.  Your sysadmin wouldn't know
what your outgoing mail contained or who it was to.  None of the
people operating remailers would know that either, because you're
using a chain.
If you could paste a line into a header that would allow others
to mail to your alias by just pressing 'r' on their mailer, then
you wouldn't be asking your correspondents to sacrifice any
convenience on their end.
The people running the alias server wouldn't know who you really
were, and niether would any of the people running the remailers
on on the encrypted return chain.
The result of all this would be that all of your incoming and
outgoing mail would be encrypted, and the identities of your
correspondents would be hidden, as would the contents of your
letters;  and you wouldn't be depending upon any single person to
hold your secrets for you, because none of the individual
remailers would be able to piece anything together, and the alias
server wouldn't know anything about you at all.  And all of this
would be 100% compatible with the existing email system (you
could communicate with non-participants).
It's almost an axiom that any simple idea like this can't work,
or else it would already be implemented.  That suggests to me
that you *can't* paste something in the header that will
automatically route replies to an alias rather than back to where
the letter came from.
Is that the case?

      1  nowhere at bsu-cs.bsu.edu <-[Way too slow.]
      1  remail at tamsun.tamu.edu <-[Way too slow.]
I'm still waiting and waiting and.... I tried these again, with no typos,
and it's been 45 minutes. Gary checked these for the FAQ so they must
work. Could be certain sites are down along the way. I have some OLD
logs of my playing with these, and at least once they got a "fast"
The problem is, I'm new to these remailers so if one fails ONCE I
don't know what to think.
P.S. I still need a perl (or whatever) script to output ten variables
containing a random assortment of remailer addresses. These need to
be csh environmental variables. This is only because I have a little
commands file that uses such variables. I know if I knew perl I could
whip this up in 5 minutes, so could somebody spend 5 and post this,
and tell me how to run it. Thanks.
