I agree to some extent, but my assessment of the probabilities is still
that using Tor unencrypted is going to cause you new and interesting

cloud-based email service.  I want to focus on getting everyone's data
decentralized, and their communications encrypted.
Grugq's writing is very interesting: He recommends using a VPN over Tor to avoid monitoring by malicious exit
nodes (which of course won't avoid monitoring by the VPN provider):
