@_subject: REMAILER-OPERATORS LIST 
I while back somebody suggested that the  list
ought to be a usegroup (in the interest of openness, I think it was).
Why not simply just ask Sameer to open subscriptions to non-operators
as well?  And post a short how-to-subscribe msg here for all to see?
Please sign me up to the  list right away, thanks.
