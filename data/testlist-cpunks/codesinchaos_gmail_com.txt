Once properly seeded, /dev/urandom is good enough. The main issue with it
is initial seeding and not using up entropy.
CJDNS doesn't use RSA. It uses elliptic curve crypto, specifically
where a private key is just a random number. No need for being a prime.

abysmal performance unless there are high performance entropy sources
available. After the initial seeding this gains very little security in
it's not guaranteed to be secure and sometimes fails in practice.
What you normally want is a source that blocks after boot until it has
accumulated enough initial entropy (say 256 bits), and then never blocks
It's not like a good PRNG gets weaker as more data is read from it when
your adversaries are computationally bounded.

This can be avoided by running a sequential computation based on that
hash. For example
by hashing it 2^40 times. Obvious downside is that verifying that the
computation was performed
correctly is just as expensive (but parallelizable).
Perhaps there is a function that's sequential and slow in one
direction and fast in the reverse direction.

No this idea isn't about proof of work. The idea is delaying the
computation result, preventing a miner from picking a value.
If the computation takes an hour on the fastest available computer and
isn't parallelizable, then a miner can't influence
the unpredictable value (unless they have 51%).
With slightly weaker security requirements iterating only a few
million times would be decent as well, since attempting to
influence the value would result in a performance hit a competitive
miner can't afford.

We need to catch a CA which does this, for example using Certificate
Then handing over the CA private key is equivalent to committing company
This means that
1. CAs will fight with all they've got
2. If corruption is successful, eliminates US CAs one by one until there
are none left to compel.
I don't think disabling auto-update is a good idea. What we need is secure
auto update.
This involves:
1) requiring multiple signatures on the update by people in different
2) Reproducible builds
3) A Certificate Transparency like log of all updates.
I believe TOR is doing some work on points 1) and 2).

Bitcoin only uses RIPEMD160(SHA256(x)) only in places where the relevant
attack is a second pre-image, not a collision. If neither hashfunction is
pathological, the pre-image resistance of this construction can't be broken
without breaking both hashes. So this construction isn't that silly.
should I? The transfer of messages within the network is dependent on a
defined protocol, so any extra bytes would just be interpreted as a
malformed message.
If you use it in a broken construction, you should be concerned. If you're
not, then there is little reason to worry.
Length extensions are only a problem with a few specific constructions. In
particular using SHA256(k||m) as MAC is broken. If you want a hash based
MAC with SHA-2, use HMAC instead.

Why would you use scrypt for anything except strengthening low entropy
secrets (like passwords)?
For high entropy secrets there are much simpler and cleaner
alternatives, such as HKDF.
