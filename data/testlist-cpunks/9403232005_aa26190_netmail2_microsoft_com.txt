Hello All,
I have an idea that may or may not be feasible so I am offering it for
What I am thinking is to have one person encrypt using a RNG (noise). He
encrypts his message using the noise on one channel and then copies the noise
utilized on another channel. He then mixes the two channels to On the other side the person must be expecting the noise and must know how to
seperate the signal. It seems that this leaves things open by having the
encryption key along with the message, but the message itself is just noise.
(i.e. the interloper must know of the signal, and know how to split it into
it's two components.)
