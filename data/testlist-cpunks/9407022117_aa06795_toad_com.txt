@_subject: Password Difficulties 
I have actually tried memorizing truly random passwords of 8 characters or longer (generated with a paranoid program similar to PGP 2.6's excellent technique).  I've found that if I review it enough, that I find patterns and mnemonic clues in such passwords that help me to remember them.  I don't imagine too many people will go through that effort, so I still think that a longer pass phrase that sort of "makes sense" is better for a PGP key.  Still, I do use the truly random passwords on publicly accessible Unix systems like CSN, since that makes dictionary attacks improbable.
