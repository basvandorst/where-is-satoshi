- It's called "S/A" (Selective Availability) which is the NWO term for adding - errors that "authorized" users can remove. (Not to be confused with A/S, or - anti-spoofing)   It was originally intended to be turned on in wartime to - deny the enemy accurate fixes, but during the Gulf War military GPS - receivers were so scarce that the soldiers had to use commercial products, - so the S/A actually was turned OFF then!
- - Since then, pressure has been building to turn off S/A, since its usefulness - is nearly zero.  Even so, the amplitude of S/A errors are only a little - larger than natural errors caused by satellite timing errors, atmospheric - propagation variations, etc.  The result is that DGPS is useful, which is - (more or less) a fixed antenna and GPS system which knows where it is, and - subtracts where it "seems" to be by GPS every second, and broadcasts the - resulting error data on some terrestrial system to receivers locally.  The - result is errors down to the 1-meter level and even lower.  That system - compensates for both natural errors and S/A, so the whole purpose of having - S/A is negated.  Eventually S/A will probably be turned off permanently, but - even then we'll want to continue to use DGPS systems.
    Close, but not quite:
S/A is an ADJUSTABLE variable, not on/off. it can reduce accuracy to 10 meters or 100 meters or whatever. It's a DoD term, not NWO term.
    The "this is where you really are" percision location (forgot the designation off hand) is ENCRYPTED (yes, there is crypto revelance here...) in the data stream from the satellites. The difference S/A makes is on the order of magnitude, therefore not "useless." It should be pointed out that different regions of the earth can have different degrees of accuracy based on the S/A system.
    I doubt S/A will ever be turned off, but this is my opinion. I know Jim's opinion. Discussion of this point is pointless.
    DGPS transmission are made from a multiple single points, which (to the best of my knowledge) are not networked.

- http request?  I know they can get your ip address, but I'm skeptical
- of getting the username.
    Yes, there are several web interfaces to anonymous remailers out there (check altavista). No, they cannot get your username UNLESS you have logged into the site by entering a username and password into a www auth dialogue box -or- you are on a Unix box which is running identd -and- the remote site runs a check (unlikely and DOES NOT apply to dialups, unless you are running identd on your dialup).
    Even in the extremely unlikely event of a remailer running a check using identd, that would not show up in the standard web logs.
    It would be theorically possible to get a username/True Name
from an IP address if you were on a dialup and the ISP kept track of who was on what dialup and when.

-     However, I suspect that the ideal would be like cryptography:
- Assume the enemy knows everything about your system but the keys.
- Thus, your gifs need to look like normal gifs in the lsb.  Your audio
- needs to have normal levels of hiss in it.  Etc.
    the problem with many current stego programs (jsteg/stools) is that given a data stream, they will tell you if there is data steg'ed (by the same program, of course) it in. jsteg goes out of it's way to hide it's content-length header, but jsteg can still detect jsteg

- probably less than the perceived need for anonymous e-mail.
simple, not real secure solutions:
find a unix host, run the cern httpd server, turn on proxying, turn off logs. (about 10-15 minute setup) if this is not run often, it works well.
use netcom (or something similiar) that gives you dynamic ip addresses. as a bonus, netcom doesn't require an actual name or address. (yes, they require a CC this allows fairly anonymous access. (prehaps one reason the neeed for web proxies isn't that high)

contact colossus at colossus.net they've already hacked majordomo to do this. please mention gpowers at meaning.com sent you.
yes, this is an ad. but, two people have already asked and i figured there might be more.
