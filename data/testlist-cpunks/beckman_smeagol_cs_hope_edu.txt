pheasable/possible to let the gov't do their little happy encryption scheme, encrypted, so if the gov't decrypts our "conversation, information, etc.." all they get is crap anyway since that's just the way it is?  THen the gov't will be happy, programmers will get great jobs from big companies to install neato different encryption schemes into their phone/pbx/fax/computers so the gov't can't watch them and then let the gov't watch the bad guys (at least the little
ones who can't afford to pay our big fees) and lock them up just like they say they will... clipper, so they can't read/see/hear/smell/touch it.  What do you people  By the way, does anyone have just a big ole text file on how to get free games
 on video games(with out 1,000,000 tokens, smashing electrical things, or using
 a string
 and a hook)... thanks.
