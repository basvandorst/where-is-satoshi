   This document describes swIPe, a network-layer security protocol for
   the IP protocol suite.  swIPe provides confidentiality, integrity,
   and authentication of network traffic, and can be used to provide
   both end-to-end and intermediate-hop security.  swIPe is concerned
   only with security mechanisms; policy and key management are handled
   outside the protocol.
1.  Introduction
   Security of network resources has been viewed traditionally as a
   trade-off between security and convenience.  The lack of a
   network-layer security protocol suitable for use in large,
   administratively heterogeneous internetworks, has given rise to ad
   hoc security efforts, such as mailbridges, filtering routers,
   firewalls, application-level gateways, etc.  The fundamental problem
   with these efforts is that, in enforcing security, they cripple the
   connectivity that makes internetworking attractive in the first
   place.

   In order that the Internet continue to grow in size and features,
   its users must be confident that it is safe to connect without hiding
   behind impenetrable draconian barriers.  The existing internetworking
   protocols, including IP, are deficient in three areas:
   * Lack of source authentication.
   * Lack of data integrity.
   * Lack of data confidentiality.
   The lack of these features in the network requires relying on
   higher-layer protocol features (e.g., TCP port numbers), or
   lower-layer features (e.g., which network interface a packet arrived
   from) to perform security functions (such as access control).  In
   most cases, `firewalls' simply create an impenetrable barrier, thus
   making it cumbersome, or even impossible, for users inside the
   firewall to take advantage of network services in the global
   Internet.
   Network security being critically important to the continued growth
   of the Internet, it is necessary to solve these problems while
   maintaining connectivity.  Cryptographic protection of network
   traffic can solve all three problems.  However, we still lack full
   understanding of the problems of heterogeneous security policies and
   of cryptographic key management in large scale networks.  Therefore,
   it is important to separate policy considerations and key management
   from the actual mechanisms in any security protocol.
   swIPe is a network-layer security protocol that provides the
   mechanisms to solve the three problems listed above.  It works by
   augmenting each packet with a cryptographically-strong authenticator
   and/or encrypting the data to be sent.
   swIPe is simple to define, implement and use in existing and future
   networks and operating systems.  It provides all the necessary
   security mechanisms and is easy to interface to loosely coupled
   policy and key management facilities that are outside the swIPe
   protocol itself.  In addition, is tied to any specialized underlying
   protocol features or cryptographic algorithms, and can therefore be
   readily adapted to new protocols and new crypto systems.
   Because swIPe operates at the network layer, it can be used to
   implement a variety of security configurations.  It can operate at
   the same granularity level as the network and therefore can provide
   security between any entities identified at the network layer (e.g.,
   host-to-host security, host-to-network, individual links, etc.).
   Depending on the capabilities of the host environment, finer

INTERNET-DRAFT      The swIPe IP Security Protocol         December 1993
   granularity is possible as well, such as security between individual
   processes running on different hosts.
   The precise security configuration of a network (which links, hosts,
   connections between processes in hosts, etc.  are protected) depends
   on the policy configuration of each network entity.  That is, a host
   may determine which outgoing packets are protected, a router may
   determine which packets to pass or reject, and so on.  For example, a
   trusted internal network need not run swIPe at all, but may still
   securely connect to external networks by running swIPe on its
   routers.
   It is important to note that the existence of a security protocol is
   not sufficient; host and site security policies must be chosen
   judiciously, and often in combination with higher-level security
   mechanisms to yield the desired effects.  As an example, providing a
   secure link between a workstation and its file server does not
   protect file data once they are on the server itself.  Similarly,
   trusting the identity of a particular host is not the same as
   trusting the integrity of the data and services provided by that
   host.
   Although it was designed to be readily adaptable to any
   connectionless network protocol, swIPe as described in this document
   is specific to IP.
2.  Protocol Description
   swIPe works by encapsulating each IP datagram to be secured inside a
   swIPe packet.  A swIPe packet is an IP packet of protocol type
   IPPROTO_SWIPE (temporarily, protocol 94, or IPPROTO_IPIP, is being
   used).  A swIPe packet starts with a header, which contains
   identifying data and authentication information; the header is
   followed by the original IP datagram, which in turn is followed by
   any padding required by the security processing.  Depending on the
   negotiated policy, the sensitive part of the swIPe packet (the
   authentication information and the original IP datagram) may be
   encrypted.
   In this document, we refer to the original IP datagram as the `inner
   packet', and the entire swIPe datagram as the `outer' packet.  The
   components of a swIPe packet are shown in the following diagram.
       +-----+-----------+-----+----------------------+---------+
IPhdr| swIPe hdr |IPhdr| payload              | padding |
       +-----+-----------+-----+----------------------+---------+
                         ^_______ inner packet _______^
       ^__________________ outer (swIPe) packet ________________^
Ioannidis & Blaze                                               [Page 3]
INTERNET-DRAFT      The swIPe IP Security Protocol         December 1993
   The inner IP header and the payload are transferred intact with
   respect to the swIPe endpoints.  That is, the Time To Live field,
   original source and destination addresses, and other such fields in
   the inner IP header are not modified.  It may be desirable (in a
   future version of the protocol) to `compress' the inner IP header,
   that is, replace it with enough information to reconstruct it from
   the outer header.  This `compression', however, must be invisible at
   the swIPe endpoints.
   The format of a swIPe packet is:
       0                   1                   2                   3

         2      Packet is encrypted; the encryption algorithm may

INTERNET-DRAFT      The swIPe IP Security Protocol         December 1993
         16-63  Control packet.  Reserved, undefined by the protocol,
                interpreted by policy and key management engines.
         64-255 Reserved; must never be used.
      Header length (8 bits)
         The length of the swIPe header in 32-bit words.  The minimum
         value is 1.
      Policy Identifier (16 bits)
         A token, negotiated at key- or policy-setup time, used by the
         recipient of the packet to choose the proper policy.  Similar
         to a SAID.
      Packet sequence number (32 bits)
         This field protects against replay attacks and may also be used
         for synchronization by a stream cipher.  It is unique within
         the context of an endpoint pair (common source/destination
         address and Policy identifier).  It is incremented by one with
         every packet sent, and initialized whenever the hosts          re-negotiate keys and/or policies.
         sequence number wraps around. A host MUST NOT accept duplicate
         increment the sequence number, or maintaining a small window
         of acceptable packet numbers.
      Authentication data (variable length, multiple of 32 bits)
         An authenticator, computed over the entire swIPe packet (minus
         the outer IP header), but before any confidentiality processing
         is performed.  When the authenticator is computed, the
         authentication data field is zeroed.
      Encapsulated packet (variable length)
         The actual packet being secured.
      Padding (variable length)
         Some security algorithms (such as DES) require padding to bring
         the length of the data to an integral multiple of the block
         size.  The padding is added after the authentication data have
         been computed.
   A swIPe system consists of three conceptual entities; the protocol
   engine, the key management engine, and the policy engine.  The swIPe
   protocol described in this document comprises the protocol engine.
   We describe the swIPe processing without specifying the precise
   semantics of either the policy or key management engines, since these
Ioannidis & Blaze                                               [Page 5]
INTERNET-DRAFT      The swIPe IP Security Protocol         December 1993
   are not part of the protocol itself.  It is useful, however, to
   consider the interaction between protocol and key management and
   policy in terms of a simple upcall interface: whenever the swIPe
   processing engine needs to determine which keys and what policy to
   use in processing a datagram, it calls the appropriate processing
   engine.  Needless to say, an implementation may optimize the actual
   mechanisms or blur the boundaries between protocol processing and
   policy.
   The policy engine is responsible for determining the precise kind of
   processing required of outgoing datagrams, and acceptance policy for
   incoming datagrams.  The key management engine establishes the
   cryptographic variables used by the protocol.  Both the policy and
   the key management engines may also communicate with their respective
   peers on remote endpoints for negotiation of policy and keys, as
   required.
   Outgoing datagrams are processed by swIPe as follows: based on
   information from the inner packet itself (IP source and destination
   address, IP protocol, other transport-layer parameters), as well as
   information from local system control structures such as protocol
   control blocks, a decision is made whether to send the packet and, if
   so, whether to apply swIPe processing to it.  If swIPe processing is
   required, the authentication and encryption algorithms, the keys to
   use, and the destination of the outer packet are determined by
   consulting the policy and key management engines.  Once the
   parameters have been determined, the swIPe packet is constructed.
   The swIPe header is prepended to the (inner) IP datagram.  The
   sequence number is copied into the packet and incremented.  If
   authentication is to be performed, the authenticator field (of the
   appropriate length) is zeroed, and the authentication algorithm is
   applied to the authentication information part of the header (i.e.,
   the swIPe header minus the first 32 bits) and the original IP
   datagram.  The checksum resulting from the application of the
   authentication algorithm is copied into the authenticator field.  If
   authentication is not performed, then the authenticator field is not
   present.  Next, if encryption is (also) specified, the appropriate
   algorithm and crypto variable are selected and applied to the same
   parts of the datagram as the authentication.  The algorithm may
   require padding, which is appended to the packet after encryption has
   been performed.  The resulting datagram is then transmitted to its
   destination (which may not be the same as that of inner packet).
   Input processing proceeds in roughly the opposite fashion.  swIPe
   datagrams that arrive are decrypted and authenticated based on
   information contained in their swIPe header.  Namely, the source,
   destination, and Policy Identifier of the outher packet are examined
   and the crypto variables and algorithms used to decrypt, verify, and
Ioannidis & Blaze                                               [Page 6]
INTERNET-DRAFT      The swIPe IP Security Protocol         December 1993
   reconstruct the original packet.  The resulting datagrams, plus any
   non-swIPe datagrams that arrive directly are checked against the
   local policy configuration to determine whether they should be
   accepted or not.  Accepted packets are processed in the ordinary
   manner (delivered to the corresponding higher-layer protocol if they
   were destined for the receiving host, or further routed if not).
3.  Discussion
   The security provided by swIPe depends upon the strength of the
   underlying cryptographic algorithms, the security of secret key
   information, and the characteristics of the protocol itself.  Since
   swIPe can be used with a wide range of crypto systems, we focus on
   the impact of the protocol features on the resulting security.
   Source authenticity of the inner packet is protected by including the
   entire inner packet (and hence its source and destination IP
   addresses) in the computation of the authenticator.  The implicit
   assumption is that the authentication function is a cryptographically
   strong one-way authenticator (such as key-seeded MD5), and that only
   the legitimate hosts have access to the authentication key.
   Similarly, data integrity is protected by the same checksum
   mechanism; replays are thwarted by the presence of the sequence
   number field.
   An adversary not possessing the authentication key cannot generate
   the authenticator for fraudulent packets; furthermore, since only
   packets that increase the sequence number are accepted (or packets
   within the acceptable window), replay attacks are not feasible either.
   Data confidentiality is provided by encrypting the entire swIPe
   packet.  Confidentiality is not limited to the actual data being
   transmitted in the inner packet, but also extends to the source and
   destination addreses, protocol characteristics (such as TCP port
   number), and so on.  Note that since the addresses of the inner
   packet are not necessarily the same as those of the outer packet, it
   is not possible for an adversary to determine the actual endpoints of
   communication without resorting to global traffic analysis.
   There are many ways to configure systems running swIPe, and many
   types of security policies that can be implemented with it.  For a
   discussion of applications of swIPe and its implementation under
   Unix, the reader is referred to "The Architecture and Implementation
   of Network-Layer Security Under Unix", by John Ioannidis and Matt
   Blaze, which appeared in the proceedings of the 4th USENIX Security
   Symposium, Santa Clara, CA, October 1993.

@_subject: Bamford on the NSA and the Greek mobile phone tapping scandal 
As some of you may remember, there was a scandal in Greece back in
February 2006 involving the interception of mobile phones belonging to
high-level government officials, including the Prime Minister.  The
CALEA software on the Ericsson switches used by Vodafone was blamed;
it had apparently been surrepticiously turned on and was copying
traffic to an equal number of "shadow" phones.
An thorny point in the investigation was the revelation that the
"shadow" phones had also been used to make phone calls to Laurel, MD.
An interview with James Bamford on the possible role of the NSA in the
"Mavili-gate" was published in last Sunday's (5/8) "To Vima", one of the
major Athens newspapers.  I contacted the journalist, Alexis Papahelas,
asking for permission to forward the article to this list, and he was
kind enough to send me the original raw transcript.  Here it is, very
slightly edited for obvious transcription mistakes. The published
article (in Greek) can be found in:
 -- Mr. Bamford Good Evening from Athens, thank you very much for being
    with us tonight.
JB: My pleasure
 -- Let me ask you first of all, there has been a lot of discussion here
    in Greece about this lawful interception software, explain to me
    what it is, and whether the US put pressure on worldwide companies
    to install that after 9/11 especially?
JB: Well the software is basically used to attach to commercial
    communication facilities, like the AT&T in the US, or whatever
    commercial company it is, and anything that goes over these
    communication facilities gets picked up, whether it is e-mail, or
    telephone calls and divert it to the US Government, whoever attached
    the equipment.
 -- Is it your understanding that most of the hardware companies around
    the world, that provide mobile telephone companies with equipment,
    had this installed at some point?
JB: Well in the US there was a lot of requiring that US companies do it,
    but around the world I think there was pressure by the US for a lot
    of the friendly countries to the US, allied countries to do as much
    as they can in terms of domestic eavesdropping and this type of
    equipment is most useful for that.
 -- As you know, during the Olympics here in 2004, a lot of the US
    intelligence agencies were here, based here, they had a lot of
    equipment here, now do you imagine they were able back then to
    monitor conversations between mobile phones here in Greece?
JB: Oh, the technology has been long in existence for them to be able to
    monitor mobile phone calls, the US monitors phone calls all over the
    world, and it has the equipment, so I would imagine that especially
    since there was a large US contingency at the Olympics in Athens,
    that they would have, the NSA would have had a presence there with
    an eavesdropping capability.
 -- Give us a sense of you know, what an NSA operation would entail here
    in Greece.
JB: Well, what would have happened was, the US would fly over a team
    plus equipment. They would first scan out the best places to maybe
    put antennas to intercept microwave communications, communications
    that would carry mobile phone signals, for example. On the other
    hand they could have also worked out an agreement with Greek
    telecommunications companies, or the Greek Government to install NSA
    equipment on their facilities in order to monitor the
    communications, so it is hard to say but there is very little
    question that the NSA did a lot of monitoring during that period of
    time.
 -- What you are saying is very important to us, so to my understanding
    is that the NSA does strike, I suppose secret agreements, with phone
    companies around the world, is that what you are saying?
JB: Oh sure, it tries as much as it can to get phone companies around
    the world to co-operate with the NSA in order to help its world-wide
    monitoring operations.
 -- And would it be acceptable for them also, to try to recruit some
    people from inside the companies, if they cannot strike such an
    agreement?
JB: Yeah, NSA does that too it will try to make a deal, to get somebody
    to co-operate. In the old days the NSA would try to get a code-clerk
    at an Embassy to co-operate, but these days they try to get people,
    that have access to large databases, or telecommunications
    facilities.
 -- We have sent you e-mails, and you have an idea of what this Greek
    system of interception looked like. Does it tell you something, I
    mean how sophisticated is it, does it tell you it is a US
    intelligence agency, a British, somebody else? What is your
    assessment?
JB: Well I think it is pretty much a standard communications system, in
    terms of mobile phone calls and so forth, they all pretty much
    operate the same way, it is just that it is a different frequency,
    maybe some different equipment, but the ideas are that the signals
    go from the hand-held cell-phone to a repeater and from a repeater
    to maybe another repeater, eventually making their ways back to
    central telephone exchange where the information is retransmitted
    out to wherever it is supposed to go, so the NSA is set up for one
    reason and that is to eavesdrop on communications around the world
    so this would not be a tremendous technological difficulty for them.
 -- But can you say with some certainty that this was an American
    operation, or it could be somebody else?
JB: Well, I am just speculating because I don't know for sure, but if
    the NSA was over there during the Olympics, and the US almost always
    sends a team consisting of people including NSA people to major
    events around the world, where Americans are going to take part, to
    try to find out if there is going to be any terrorism, and one way
    of doing that is by monitoring the communications, that go through
    the air, the communications that are communicated both internally
    and externally from that country.
 -- How many mobile phone-call-conversations could the NSA monitor in a
    country like Greece on any given day?
JB: It is hard to say. What they would probably do , is to focus on the
    key-links where they think that the bulk of the
    communications-exchanges are going to be and probably intercept
    those kind of communications. And once they intercept them,
    the NSA would have computer-facilities so that the communications
    would go through the computers and they are probably going to be
    looking for calls from Afghanistan, information that they think is
    very susceptible to terrorism, for example in other words numbers
    that they have of previous terrorist contacts. They would all be fed
    in the computer, and then any e-mail or telephone-call with those
    numbers or e-mail- addresses would be kicked out.
 -- Now, who translates all of these things, because I imagine it is
    like thousands of hours of conversations that are being transmitted
    to NSA. everyday.
JB: Well it is, but they take in enormous amounts of communications,
    but filters, computerized filters sort of get rid off by 98% of
    it, and there is only a 2% that actually gets analyzed in the
    end. And those 2% are whether names in the computer, people that
    they are suspicious of, telephone numbers that they are looking
    for, e-mail-addresses, and once they get down to those, and they
    do have a number of people that speak a wide variety of languages,
    including Greek at NSA.
 -- What is the most technologically advanced way of intercepting
    mobile phone conversations? Because for a while we are assuming
    that the code of transmitting over the air is safe. Is it still
    safe or has the NSA broken it?
JB: No, if the communications are traveling through the air, which
    they do by a mobile phone call, they are going to go a very short
    distance so they get to a repeater and they eventually go to a
    central telephone office, so again if you are able to intercept
    those signals as they go through the air, which you would
    basically just need a microwave antenna, or if you have
    co-operation of the company or the Government, then you can get
    access of that. I mean they are not intercepting the entire
    communications systems by entering or leaving the country,
    certainly, but they are probably looking at certain key
    communications-node, where they think there may be communications
    coming from lets say places like Afghanistan, or Iraq or some
    place like that.
 -- Give us a sense of the Size of NSA, in terms of the budget of
    people working for it and so on.
JB: NSA is the largest intelligence agency in the world, and it is
    twice the size of the CIA, it is far more secret, and it has about
    38.000 people. Again NSA's entire job, at least until recently,
    was to spy overseas, to eavesdrop on communications in foreign
    countries. So most of those people are either at the headquarters
    at NSA, or else in countries around the world. NSA over the years
    has had a number of facilities in Greece at various times, I am
    not sure if they have one there now, but in the past they have had
    bases in Greece.
 -- And do you think they are focusing in that area from what you
    know, from your research, was Greece always sort of an important
    target for them?
JB: Well, Greece has always been a target, I think it depends on world
    climate how important it is at various times, I mean right now it
    probably has less importance than it did in other times, because
    now they are focusing primarily on Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan,
    N. Korea, areas like that, but if it looks like some terrorists
    are coming into Greece, or are operating in Greece, or if it looks
    like the Government may be communicating with countries that the
    NSA is very interested in, such as Iran, Iraq or any places in the
    Middle East than the NSA would be very interested.
 -- Let me go back to what was the Greek system and so on.You had said
    in previous answer that there are very few people in the world,
    that could actually manipulate this Eriksson software in order to
    gain access to this system. How many people in the world have this
    kind of knowledge?
JB: I don't know how many people around the world, but NSA's job, that
    is their entire job. This agency was created for one purpose and
    that is to eavesdrop on the maximum matter of communications
    around the world. NSA could find a way to get a trapped door or a
    back door into say an Eriksson telephone system, you know they
    would do it. Because those systems are used by people all over the
    world.
 -- In this case we are talking about a very big cell-phone- company,
    VODAFONE, which is a multinational as you know, would they risk
    you think their reputation, and you know, go ahead and co-operate
    with NSA at that level?
JB: I would think that they would not co-operate at that level, but
    what the NSA normally does, is it hires people that have worked
    for companies like that, and these people tell them how the
    systems work and then their job with NSA is to reverse engineer
    these systems, to find ways into them, so although I doubt that
    the head of Eriksson would co-operate with NSA, the NSA has
    enormous technological capabilities to find sort of back doors, or
    trapped doors, or ways by reversed engineering into these systems.
 -- Knowing how these people work there is a legal investigation, a
    judicial investigation here in Greece, do you think they will ever
    find the answers, I mean who was behind this interception, any
    physical evidence, any traces?
JB: Well, it is hard to say. This happened in the US several times,
    where there has been a question, whether monitoring has been legal
    or not, and they have looked into it occasionally and they have
    found an answer as to who was involved with it, but a lot of times
    they do not find him. Again with NSA, NSA keeps its information so
    very-very secret, they wouldn't even let the judges on the
    surveillance court, they are supposed to prove NSA warrants about
    it, they wouldn't let Congress except for 8 people. Over 500 people
    know about it, so NSA tries to keep it extremely secret.
 -- You are one of the world experts in this kind of issues, so if you
    had to take a bet today who was behind this kind of operations in
    Greece?
JB: I just cant say, I don't know enough information about it , all I
    can tell you is that NSA's job is eavesdropping on communications
    around the world , Greece is a target occasionally whenever they
    think there is something important. NSA has bases in Greece and
    NSA looking for indications of terrorism during the Olympics, so
    whether they are involved with this recent operation I don.t know
    but certainly they have an interest in it.
 -- Your advice to someone using a mobile phone, should they talk
    openly or no?
JB: The problem, cell phones also, there is not kind of information
    that the NSA cant eavesdrop on one way or another, this is why in
    the USA there is a big debate right now about making the NSA go
    through a quirk and get an authorization before they eavesdrop on
    somebody, but overseas the NSA can eavesdrop on anybody they want,
    there is no restriction on eavesdropping in Greece, even if there
    was an American in Greece, NSA could eavesdrop on that person
    without going through a quirk.
 -- so you are saying even the crypto phones that the prime
    minister/government/military are using they are vulnerable to this
    kind of penetration you say.
JB: Well, crypto phones are probably NSA's biggest targets around the
    world, whether or not the NSA was able to break the encryption of
    the algorithm to get into those phones I don't know. I don't have
    this information, but I know obviously NSA's key job, NSA's first
    job is intercepting communications, and second job is breaking
    codes such as the codes that encrypts that communications, and
    third job is making USA encryption systems.
 -- Thank you
