@_subject: David Kahn's "The Codebreakers", a new version. (question) 
Hi there.
  I have noticed while browsing through that in December 1996 a new version of "The Codebreakers" will be
published. The complete title says:
"The Codebreakers : The Comprehensive History of Secret Communication
from Ancient Times to the Internet"
Does anyone know if it will also include the complete 1967 edition,
or just the abridged 1973 one? I have managed to locate one copy of
the 1967 edition in our central library and found that there is quite
a lot of information that I fear the writer might want to ommit in this
new edition.
Does anyone have any more info about it?
Thanks a lot,
Michael Pak
