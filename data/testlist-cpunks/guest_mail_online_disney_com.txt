to find out what's new at Disney!  From now on, all you'll need to enter our contests and sweepstakes are your parent or guardian's permission -- and your Disney.com Registration Name and Password.  We suggest you make a note of these names so you don't forget them.
If you do forget them, you can use your special, easy-to-remember Disney.com "code word" to find them again.
Just to make sure our records are correct, please take a look at the

We're sending your parent or guardian an e-mail message just to let
them know you've registered with us.  Any prizes you win at
Disney.com will be awarded to them on your behalf, so they should
know you registered.
There's a whole world of Disney at your fingertips, so have fun!

Dear Parent --
We at Disney.com wanted to let you know that a guest has registered at our Web site as your child.  We welcome guests of all ages, and it is our policy to let parents and guardians know when children under 16 send us personal information. This message is only a confirmation -- it does not require a reply if you grant your child permission to be registered at Disney.com.  If you'd like to cancel that Registration, please see the instructions below. Here's what we received when your child registered:
     Your child's first name:              cypherpunks
     Your child's last name:               cypherpunks

     Your child's year of birth:           1990
     Child's Disney.com Registration Name: cypherpunks
You might want to ask what your child's Password is and make a note of it.  If you or your child lose or forget the Disney.com Registration Name and/or Password, you can retrieve them using the special, easy-to-remember "code word" your child also selected upon registering.  If your child wins prizes at Disney.com, you will receive them on his or her behalf.  If you'd like to cancel your child's Disney.com Registration, please
follow these simple steps:
1. Click the "Reply" button on your e-mail application.
2. Make sure your reply contains the text of this message (including
   your child's name, e-mail address, and Registration Name).
