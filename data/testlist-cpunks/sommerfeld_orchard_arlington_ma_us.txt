So, what's my reason to accept a "payment in cpu time"?  As best as I
can tell, a "payment in cpu time" means that someone *else* doesn't
get a payment in cpu time with their spam.  I still get the spam.
It seems analagous to a protocol that proves that someone burned a
dollar bill.
A scheme where I actually get something of value might have a bit more

<20030512214557.A9261480 If you believe spammers are beginning to use viruses to deploy spam relays.
If a spammer has a zombie army of a few thousand compromised systems,
the spammer's cpu time costs for hashcash will also essentially be
free.

<3b390e12cb7ab0bf392101e2e8fa92a5 A skeptic of the above scenario could claim that the "explorer" was
actually a pair of identical twins (one of whom was hiding in the cave
before you entered) rather than a single individual.
One possible defense against this would involve an uncopiable but
verifiable token given to the "first" explorer.
