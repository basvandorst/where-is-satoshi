To some extent, this discussion is ignoring the importance of "context".  Yes, if you have to do detailed searches of the data
traveling down a million lines, you are likely to fail.  That is
why you don't do it.  What you DO is look for things that look out of the ordinary,
things that alone would look fine, but within a given context would look wrong, and then search those exception cases in more detail.  Example, someone comes up with a way that voice
looks just like fax from the data spectrum standpoint.  Great,
no way that anyone can scan the line and figure out, in the few seconds that they are scanning, that what they are seeing is really voice.  So, you attack it by looking at connection records, and looking for what looks like fax machines from the data standpoint, but seems to have a usage record (times of day, duration of calls, time between retrys, etc) of telephones.
Remember, even though the technology has changed, the end users
of it have not, and the end users are the ones that you are looking for, the ones who are setting up the usage records.
So, they now have a catagory of "fax machines that behave like
fax machines" and "fax machines that behave like phones".
Wonder which ones they will use the Special Equipment on, eh?
Same goes for PGP vs. GIFS.  The guy moving 4k long GIFS is
the guy moving the PGP stuff that looks like GIFS.  It doesn't nail all of the possible uses, but this is all a game of the odds anyway, and in the long run the usage patterns, the more meta
data, can give people good clues to work with.
