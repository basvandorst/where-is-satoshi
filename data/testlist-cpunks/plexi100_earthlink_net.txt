Is there a program available to detect hidden software and remove software
that is sending screenshots or keystrokes to an unknown address from my
computer? I currently use Spycop and have Norton AV installed. I have
detected some suspicious activity on my computers and am tired of reloading
my OS. Thank you in advance, Dave.
