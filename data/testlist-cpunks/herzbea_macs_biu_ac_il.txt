@_subject: Trojan horse attack involving many major Israeli companies,  
References: <429B1666.90701  Nicely put, but I think not quite fair. From friends in financial and other companies in the states and otherwise, I hear that Trojans are very common there as well. In fact, based on my biased judgement and limited exposure, my impression is that security practice is much better in Israeli companies - both providers and users of IT - than in comparable companies in most countries. For example, in my `hall of shame` (link below) you'll find many US and multinational companies which don't protect their login pages properly with SSL (PayPal, Chase, MS, ...). I've found very few Israeli companies, and of the few I've found, two actually acted quickly to fix the problem - which is rare! Most ignored my warning, and few sent me coupons :-) [seriously]
Could it be that such problems are more often covered-up in other countries? Or maybe that the stronger awareness in Israel also implies more attackers? I think both conclusions are likely. I also think that this exposure will further increase awareness among Israeli IT managers and developers, and hence improve the security of their systems.

@_subject: Hall of Shame of Unprotected Login Sites, and Phishing/Spoofing 
Many important, sensitive login sites are not protected, making it
easier to steal passwords from naive (and even experienced) users. See
`Hall of Shame` listing such sites at
Banks and FIs: PayPal, Chase, SmithBarney (CitiGroup), Bank of
America, TD Waterhouse, Amex, FirstCommand Bank, MidFirst Bank
Security services: MicroSoft Passport, EquiFax, InstantSSL
All sites were warned before being added to the Hall of Shame (few
actually fixed their sites and are therefore not on the page, e.g.
