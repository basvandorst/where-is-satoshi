@_subject: [silk] "outsourcing torture" - a b-school style case study 
Now we finally learned what we all suspected: the numerous reports and
testimonies about the Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib prisons were a trap to
distract the attention of the public from the true secret: in the last days,
big media reported that the CIA operates secret detention facilities beyond
the reach of the law and outside official oversight at bases in two eastern
European countries and some other Asian countries. The CIA has not even
acknowledged the existence of these "black sites" with "ghost prisoners": to
do so could open the U.S. government to legal challenges, since the
prisoners are there submitted to "Enhanced Interrogation Techniques" (the US
newspeak for torture). The original idea was to hide and interrogate the two
dozen or so al Qaeda leaders believed to be responsible for the Sept. 11
attacks, or who posed an imminent threat; but as the CIA began apprehending
more people whose intelligence value and links to terrorism were less
certain, the original standard for consigning suspects to the invisible
universe was lowered or ignored.
