I believe you did, when you stated that your "OTP" (and I am only using
"OTP" in this case to point up your misusage of the term, and not to
claim that what you are doing is any such thing) is used to seed your
"RNG" (another misnomer).
Do remember that the majority of my mail has not been copied to the
Not a chance, slick.  A One-Time Pad is well defined within the art, and
your PRNG system is no such thing.  I will thank you to not postulate
what I may or may not recognize.
