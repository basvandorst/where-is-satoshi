Is there a good source on the net for implemented C/C++ routines such as a DES algorithm? I am a programmer in need of some fairly secure encryption routine. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Good News Folks!!
As far as I can tell, cypherpunks wasn't subscribed to anything. What
happened instead was someone started forging email in the name of the
list's submission address to various of my mailbots, which simply send
an informational e-mail back.
If they HAD spammed it onto a list, it'd be easier,b ecause I have some
anti-spamming stuff  in place, plus full logging on where requests come
from. I haven't had that on the mailbots before now, because nobody's
done this before that i know of. Guess I'm spending the next few days
closing this loophole...
Sorry for the inconvenience. I'll clean this up as soon as I can, or at
least get logging in place to see where it's coming from, because
honestly, this one's a tough one to fix without just shutting down the
And frankly, if someone's starting to use mailbots to spam, lists are
in big trouble, because there are zillions of those out there. Most
systems, for instance, have "info at xxxxx" addresses, all of which would
do exactly what my mailbots are doing.

I am withdrawing from this list. Not because of the volume of email...that I can deal with...but what I cannot deal with is the volume of garbage and egotistical ranting that seems so prevalent in what should for all sakes and purposes be a discussion of cyphering and security. Apparently the name of this list is designed to mislead...because of all the posts, a grand total of 5% proved worth reading at all.
Thank you and good day.
