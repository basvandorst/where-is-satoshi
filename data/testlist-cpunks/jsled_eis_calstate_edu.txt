He was getting spam from AOL at the rate of 25 messages every 5 seconds... so he took the system down.

@_subject: C'punks slogan? 
Mostly because I'm looking at having bumper stickers made, and partly because I'm testing a procmail script :), I want a few suggestions for a good slogan for the C'punks, something that would look good on a bumper sticker... stuff I've come up with so far is like:
sub rosa - Cypherpunks 1995
Support your local Cypherpunk
Privacy isn't a crime (I think I stole that from somewhere)
Ensuring privacy isn't a crime
And that's about it.... you should see by now why I'm asking. :)
