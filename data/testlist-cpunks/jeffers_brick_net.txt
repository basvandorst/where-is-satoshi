My fellow Cypherpunks,
                    The Liberty Dollar
My fellow Cypherpunks,
   I think I may have some really great news here, but you all
can check it out to be sure. I found an alternative money on the
Internet. It is called the Liberty Dollar. The Internet site is:
NORFED  is  The National Organization for the Repeal of the Federal Reserve
Act and the Internal Revenue Code.
   The money is backed by silver and gold and can be redeemed widely
in America.
   As many of you know, the $US is a corrupt, proprietary, debt issued,
fait, fractional reserved,illegal, unconstituional, U. S. State enforced
monopoly currency. As
corrupt as it is I don't know why it hasn't already collasped and
dragged us down with it!
   If the Liberty Dollar is honest and robust, then it may be the
vehical to beat the elite bankers tyranny and give us an honest
wealth produced money.
Yours Truly,

My fellow Cypherpunks,
   This then brings up the question of Open Source operating systems like
the (GNU) Linux distributions and the BSD operating
systems. Is the TCPA/DRM feature code to be published or censored out? For
the source code, will the censored code
be a binary file? This could be a mess. I believe that there was a
discussion of US mandated Malice code in Open
Source operating systems on the Cypherpunks list recently, but I couldn't
find it with a Google search. Anybody got a
Cypherpunk Hyperarchive link?
   If the above happens, it would keep the coding anarchists busy for years
:-) Recompiling your operating system with
an outlaw file included would be an anarchic and patriotic act. It could
also knock down Microsoft market share.
   I suspect the the US solution would be hardware. All new hardware would
be maliced and old hardware would become

@_subject: WinXP SP1 out next Monday - but can you avoid it?  
My fellow Cypherpunks,
   I found this link about WinXP SP1  .  SP stands for "service pack". The
article tells of some nasty goodies that MicroSoft has included
in it. The 2nd link has more info..
   You know, sometime we are going to have to abandon MS. I've already got a
dual booting system: MS and Red Hat Linux. I am slowly
migrating functions to Linux. The (GNU) Linux's and the free BSD's are good
alternatives to MS. If you can't live without MS, then make
your computer system dual booting.  Also, dual booting will allow you to
make a fairly easy migration to a DECENT operating system .
MS is getting more and more oppressive.

   Check out the site:
   It is a heavy site that informs about the world's ongoing political
