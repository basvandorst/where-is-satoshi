I had to wade through all that government stuff a while back.  I've got the
complete series, but haven't gotten any updates. :(  It's all pretty dry
and stuffy, but it did have some useful stuff, like the password guidelines
and how they figure out which machines can be trusted and which can't.
Why is Directive 145 important?    I got a good laugh out of that one!! :) :)
