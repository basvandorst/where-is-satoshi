In article ,
This comment is grossly unfair.  Obviously Homer is going to a lot of
effort to operate his remailer in the best way possible.  It's easy for others to be critical.  "head on a plate" is a strong
term to use, given Homer made it clear he would not reveal the
identity of an anonymous user without a court order.  Also, one
wonders to what end remailers are being put by people who are worried
about being "sold out".
It's always been a good policy to use a foreign mailer in a chain
where anonymity is critically important.  That doesn't mean it's OK
to make Homer the whipping boy.
