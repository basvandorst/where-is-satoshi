@_subject: Any Info for Sen. Pressler.... 
If anyone has any specific bits of info on cryptography, etc...
please feel free to send it to me...
I live in South Dakota...
Due to circumstances I occasionally see and speak w/ Senator Larry Pressler - (Committee Leader)...
(btw, I am not a Pressler plant or anything...)
Been talking to him w/ the Burns Bill and such... He wants less gov't. control, but does have "concerns" w/ the garbage...
And, wants to balance the business and private concerns...
He is open to any info from a "constituent" though...
He who joyfully marches to music in rank and file has already earned my contempt.  He has been given a large brain by mistake, since for him the spinal cord would suffice.  -- Mark Twain
