@_subject: Wired `Cypherpunk' issues will be available at the meeting 
I got a box of magazines and will be selling them at the cover price
($5) at the meeting.  It's the May/June issue.  The cover features
three masked cypherpunks behind a flag; the whole crew appears on page 54.
People who aren't coming to the meeting can get copies at their local
bookstore, or call George Clark at Wired at +1 415 904 0660.  If you
want to subscribe (6 issues/year, $20), you can call +1 800 SO WIRED
or send a check to Wired, 544 2nd St, SF, CA 94107.
