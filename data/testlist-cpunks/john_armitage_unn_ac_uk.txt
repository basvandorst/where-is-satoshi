DEMOCRATIC RIGHTS MUST NOT BECOME THE COLLATERAL
DAMAGE CAUSED BY THE WAR AGAINST TERRORISM
A group of lawyers have drawn up an "Appeal" to the European
Parliament to reject the proposal by the European Commission
which seeks to introduce a binding Framework Decision
introducing a definition of "terrorism" which would seriously
threaten democratic rights and the "freedom of association, the
right to strike and freedom of expression". The "appeal" has
already been signed by 82 lawyers from six countries and is open
to lawyers, organisations and others to sign up to - by sending an
e-mail to: jan.fermon at skynet.be
The text of the "appeal" is available in most EU languages.
