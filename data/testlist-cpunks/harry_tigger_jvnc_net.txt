I can't give you a definitive answer here, but I'll take a shot.  Most Internet telephony systems use UDP packets to transfer speech, since the lower overhead of UDP (as opposed to TCP) allows for better throughput.      I assume (but I'm not certain) that PGPfone works the same way.
Unfortunately, most of your other TCP/IP communication will be based on TCP packets.  Therefore, it's theoretically possible for your ISP to monitor your traffic, watching for large numbers of UDP packets.  Harry Hochheiser           harry at tigger.jvnc.net

Unfortunately, most of your other TCP/IP communication will be based on TCP packets.  Therefore, it's theoretically possible for your ISP to monitor your traffic, watching for large numbers of UDP packets.  While a large amount of UDP traffic wouldn't _prove_ that you were using Internet telephony, they might _assume_ that the UDP traffic was voice traffic.  It all depends on how sophisticated and heavy-handed they wanted to be about it.
Now, I don't know if PGPfone uses UDP.  However, if it did, it would be as easy to detect as any other Internet telephony product.  An encrypted bunch of UDP bits is as easy to spot as an un-encrypted bunch, even if the contents can't be interpreted.
I hope this helps.  If any of this content is incorrect, my Harry Hochheiser           harry at tigger.jvnc.net
