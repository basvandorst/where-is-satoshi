Apologies if you receive more than one copy of this message, but I'm
auto-replying to your message to handle the flood:
Redistribution to the list from which you originally received the
message is kindly requested.
    Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention. The email or
    posting you have seen falsely represents Smith Barney and its
    employees. These are erroneous postings that did not originate from
    anyone employed by our firm, and therefore we cannot directly stop
    them from occurring. However we have advised the companies we
    to have serviced the originator of these messages and we are
    all possible steps to end this fraud. Unfortunately some people
    the Internet and we regret any inconvenience they may have caused
    There are currently no mailing lists maintained in the smb.com
    so you were not subscribed to any list. If you receive any further
    messages of this nature, they are the product of the same spurious
    source.
    We're sorry for any inconvenience you may have experienced as a
    of this unfortunate abuse of the 'Net.
    Further queries via email to postmaster at smb.com please.
    Thanks.
    -James
