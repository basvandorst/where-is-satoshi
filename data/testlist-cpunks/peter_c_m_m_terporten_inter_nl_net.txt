@_subject: Suit filed to enjoin crypto provisions of the ITAR 
I am  just such a simpe foreigner trying to understand this.
I thought that the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) had in
the meantime been replaced with the Defense Trade Regulations (TDR). If not,
is this still in the planning?
And is the latest ITAR text somewhere on the net?
