@_subject: Remailer Update 
I'm glad you caught the problem.  I'd hate to see what would have
happened if it had gone on for too long.  :)
My remailer was off-line from midnite to about 18:00 hours (eastern
time) today.  I took it off-line so I could handle the toad.com mail
bomb.  I have restored the remailer and FAQ server to normal operation. About 15 messages piled up in the queue during this time, and I sent
them out about an hour ago.  Let me know if there were any problems. Also, let me know your opinions on overall functionability of the
remailer, and any bugs/problems.
To everyone who requested the source code, sorry I haven't gotten to it
yet.  I will...
P.S. The remailer info I maintain at mg5n+remailers at andrew.cmu.edu has
gotten quite popular.  When I first set it up, I got at most 2-3
requests a day.  The last couple of days I have been getting 10 to 15
remailer-info requests a day.  I wonder where they're coming from...I
guess some non-cypherpunks groups have gotten on the anonymnity
bandwagon.  Wow... there goes another one.  (I have it display a message
on my screen whenever a request goes thru.)
