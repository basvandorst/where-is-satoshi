You are right, I'm sorry.
Anyway, it's no longer necessary to ask the AES finalist teams (all of which seem to have been offline for the last few days) about NIST's announcement.
Sorry again, and best wishes,

I've been told that entrust is embedding CAST-256, but this don't seem to
matter that much.  I wouldn't be surprised if RSA did the same with RC6; it is
much less probable that IBM or Counterpane do this regarding MARS and Twofish,
respectively. Counterpane lists several products known to implement Twofish.
The shareware library MIRACL includes Rijndael for a long time now.  I don't
think it's difficult to find more examples.

Actually I had the clear impression that there were three real contenders:
Rijndael, Serpent, and Twofish, in this order.

Hmm, pseudo-conspiratorial indeed, to say the least.
I certainly noticed the fact that Rijndael was not mentioned in the Hitachi
claim.  However, so did Bruce Schneier, and he pointed out that Rijndael's
ShiftRow operation is in fact a rotation, and so it should be also be
covered by Hitachi's claims.  Therefore, all AES finalists were
seemingly equally endangered.  I personally find Hitachi's claims absurd, and I
wanted to know whether NIST thought the same way as I did.
However, I think you might use the 21st century US legal system to manifest your
concerns, if indeed you have any, that Hitachi's patent hindered the choice of
any other algorithm (as this was rumoured a few days ago in this list -- I
wonder who posted it, don't you, Vin?), against NIST's own statement on the
contrary, made in the final report available from NIST's web site.
I'll bet most people that were committed (perhaps financially) to
any other of the finalists will show a reaction similar to yours. Well, this
reaction is not unexpected anyway -- just remember that saying about Greeks and

Did *they* tell anything? I'll bet NIST has contacted (or will contact)
them regarding the forthcoming announcement. And the e-mail address
 means that at least the RC6 team is easily accessible,
isn't it?
