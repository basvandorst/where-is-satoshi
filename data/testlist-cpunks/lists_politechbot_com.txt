October 20, 2000 - New York Times (front page)
        Taking Aim at Tax Havens, I.R.S. Seeks Credit Card Slips
          By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON
         The Internal Revenue Service, struggling against Caribbean
havens it suspects of
          draining away at least $70 billion a year in personal income
tax revenue, has set its sights
          on a new target  the credit card slips of  suspected tax
          The agency has asked a federal judge in Miami to issue
summonses for two years'
          worth of records of MasterCard and American Express card
transactions in the
          United States that were billed to bank accounts in Antigua and
Barbuda, the
          Bahamas and the Cayman Islands.
          Using the Internet and other outlets, banks in those nations
openly solicit
          tax evasion in ways that the I.R.S. says have proved
attractive to
          corporate executives, business owners, doctors and other
          people in the United States.
          Americans can legally move their assets offshore but are
required to
          notify the I.R.S. of those transactions and to pay taxes on
their income
          worldwide. Some Caribbean countries offer an alluring tax
          however, because they impose no income tax and do not
          cooperate with I.R.S. efforts to track down incomes.

@_subject: More censorware stupidity, from the anti-spam camp 
In principle I'm not sure if this is a terribly difficult problem to
solve. If the costs to subscribing to antispamlists are still not as
great as the (growing) problem of spam, admins will still want a
service and someone will probably create it.
Given sufficient demand of this sort, a standard interface may well
emerge. This would allow sites to subscribe to a antispamlist
maintainer uber-service that would selectively add and drop
MAPS/ORBS/etc. as they become more and less useful. This may be a pay
service. It would allow ISPs and individual users not to worry about
what happens if one service dies; within a few moments, one hopes, the
maintainer service would remove it. Queries would go to the maintainer
service, not the individual antispamlists.
The maintainer service could also provide the useful feature of a
standard interface; give it an IP address and it would query the
antispamlist vendors using their individual different protocols.
Obviously ISPs see a benefit to using antispamlists. Just arguing
against them isn't very persuasive; it doesn't give them a way to solve
their growing spam problem.
If EFF is concerned about this policy area (and I recognize it may be
just your personal opinion), it may want to provide the useful service
of recommending ways to improve the protocols and what marketing
flacks call "best practices."
If people begin to care about what you call stealth blocking, ISPs
will probably begin to disclose it. Perhaps an ISP trade association
will recommend a link on the home page. Then you could take your
business to an ISP, if you care enough, that does not subscribe to
antispamlists -- as long as you're willing to pay more because of the
additional bandwidth, storage, and personnel costs imposed by the
higher volume of spam.

Secret Messages Come in .Wavs
   by Declan McCullagh (declan at wired.com)
   2:00 a.m. Feb. 20, 2001 PST
   FAIRFAX, Virginia -- Neil Johnson has a job that's nothing if not
   unusual: He investigates how to uncover concealed messages embedded in
   sound and video files.
   A researcher at Virginia's George Mason University, Johnson is one of
   a small but growing number of digital detectives working in the field
   of computer steganalysis -- the science of detecting hidden
   communications.
   "I analyze stego tools," said the 32-year-old security specialist who
   is the associate director of GMU's Center for Secure Information
   Systems. "I try to find out what can be detected or disabled. I see
   what their limitations are."
   The tools he's talking about include programs such as Steghide, which
   can embed a message in .bmp, .wav and .au files; and Hide and Seek,
   which works with .gif images.
   Most computer-based steganography tools have one thing in common: They
   conceal information in digitized information -- typically audio, video
   or still image files -- in a way that prevents a casual observer from
   learning that anything unusual is taking place.
   The surprising news, according to Johnson and other researchers:
   Current stego programs don't work well at all. Nearly all leave behind
   fingerprints that tip off a careful observer that something unusual is
   going on.
   Johnson's work on steganalysis may seem obscure, but it has important
   law enforcement and military applications. The National Security
   Agency and police agencies have underwritten his research -- his
   center's graduate program at GMU is even certified by the NSA.
   The Pentagon funds related research at other institutions, and the
   Naval Research Laboratory is helping to organize the fourth annual
   Information Hiding Workshop in Pittsburgh from April 25 to 27.
   Earlier this month, news reports said U.S. officials were worried that
   operatives of accused terrorist Osama bin Laden now use steganographic
   applications to pass messages through sports chat rooms, sexually
   explicit bulletin boards and other sites. That complicates the NSA's
   mission of "sigint," or signals intelligence, which relies on
   intercepting communications traffic.
   [...]
   WetStone's "Steganography Detection and Recovery Toolkit" is being
   developed for the Air Force Research Laboratory in Rome, New York. The
   project overview, according to the company, is "to develop a set of
   statistical tests capable of detecting secret messages in computer
   files and electronic transmissions, as well as attempting to identify
   the underlying steganographic method. An important part of the
   research is the development of blind steganography detection methods
   for algorithms."
   Gordon said the effort arose from a study the Air Force commissioned
   from WetStone on forensic information warfare in 1998. The company was
   asked to identify technologies that the Air Force needed to guard
   against and it highlighted steganography as one of them.
   In addition to the NSA and the eavesdrop establishment, military
   installations, government agencies, and private employers could be
   affected by steganography. An employee or contractor could send
   sensitive information via e-mail that, if hidden, would not arouse
   suspicion.

Anybody Home at Whitehouse.gov?
   by Declan McCullagh (declan at wired.com)
   4:00 p.m. Jan. 21, 2001 PST
   WASHINGTON -- President Bush not only got the keys to the White House
   this weekend, but he also took over the official whitehouse.gov
   website.
   While the new president's speedily organized inaugural celebration
   concluded without incident in a chill rain, the launch of the Bush
   administration's Web presence was not as successful.
   Dozens of links return error messages, and the home page appears to
   have sported an unusual slogan on the left-hand rail when it first
   went up on Saturday: "Insert Something Meaningful Here."
   At high noon on Saturday, as Bush and Vice President Cheney took oaths
   of office on the Capitol building steps, the new administration
   officially took over the whitehouse.gov domain.
   Many of the text-only whitehouse.gov pages, designed for readers who
   are visually impaired or have low-bandwidth connections, return broken
   links. Clicking on the text-only option from the search page results
   in a malformed link with the title:
   "
   Links at the bottom of the White House History page -- including past
   first families, first ladies, or tour information -- return "404: The
   page cannot be found".
   In the children's area of whitehouse.gov, the Historic Moments page
   includes broken links to images of Abraham Lincoln and Franklin
   Roosevelt.
   On the home page, the placeholder message "Insert Something Meaningful
   Here" briefly appeared on the left side of the screen, according to a
   Wired News reader who saved a screen snapshot. The message, according
   to the snapshot, appeared under "President George W. Bush is
   Inaugurated as President of the United States" and above "Recent
   Additions."

Oh, don't get me wrong. I'm not defending the L-M work. Even if I were
so inclined, I read it years ago and I'm sure my memory has faded.
I was merely pointing out a flaw in your argument against it. The two
