I doubt you can get at the raw packets coming out of the GSM codec and
going to the modem without some serious mangling of the phone's
firmware. Initiating data-calls which then carry the encrypted voice
packets seem like a much more feasible idea. From what I've heard, some
of the recent crop of PDA phones, notably the Nokia 7650 and the
Sony-Ericsson P-800, contain an ARM-9 core with a clock speed above 100
MHz, which might just be sufficient for getting encrypted voice
communications on these gadgets of the ground. This of highly course
depends on how much cycles your voice codec chews. Seeing that both
phones run under Symbian OS 6 and 7 respectively you might even get
portability for your application.
Easier still might be porting Nautilus or Speak Freely to the Zaurus or
just using ZMeeting over an IPsec tunnel over a GPRS connection.

I thought this might be of interest for the list, but haven't seen it mentioned/discussed here: Some progress has been made reverse-engineering the Skype protocol [1]. No details on the crypto implementation yet, but first attempts to understand the P2P model they [1] S. A. Baset and H. Schulzrinne

Uhm. That's not really an entire operating system. Moreover it's  implemented in Javascript, not in Java. Anyone got a reference for  the Unix-like OS implementation atop of a JVM? I haven't heard of  anyone trying to do a OS-on-top-of-a-JVM implementation since the  failure of Sun's JavaOS [1].
Anyway. As far as I know, the JAP source code [1] contains some  usable Java tor client implementation if you throw out all the GUI  crap. Writing a TOR server implementation in Java shouldn't be so  hard either.

Yeah. That would really work. We should pitch that idea to some  spammers :) Enough cover traffic in *THAT* mix-network as well...
