@_subject: PGP Sig Proposal 
I have never posted to this list before because I am rather new to it.
What bothers me is that as a Hardware Technician it is the Cypherpunks
that inspired me to flagellate myself at my keyboard while invoking
the deity of Borland in ANSI 'C' to compile my source code. Ok, so it
never works but the idea of the Cypherpunks has made me a (limited)
programmer none the less.
*Not* signing messages because you are asked to flies in the face of
the purpose it serves. To spread the word about PGP and, as it has done,
uncover any difficulties that may still exist in the propagation and
utilitization of PGP. In actuality the amount of mail that suggests the difficulty in performing
PGP signing should be a call to all Cypherpunks to start coding. Instead,
like a child that has been asked to play with a favorite toy, there is refusal based soley on....I won't do it because you asked me to do it.
Forging signatures is a waste of resources that could be better spent
finding ways to smooth the path for PGP and similar encrypting/signing
If I want to be anonymous  I will use CHAIN and go thru a remailer. My .sig and PGP sig say the rest.

@_subject: Date for 2048 bit Keys?? 
You beat me to the post :(
I tested this out earlier today. I changed the system clock
and I got this:
Type bits/keyID    Date       User ID
pub  1024/BEB3ED71 1994/09/18 J.L.Francois pub  2047/D9E1F2E9 1995/01/01 Francois, J.L It works but take a lot more time, obviously, to generate the key.

Not that easy. They would just crack the code and *another*
    acronym based agency would come up with a different reason to     seize you and your computer. It would seem unrelated to anyone
    but *you* since you would know what you did but would have no     way to prove that your original infraction is why you are doin'
    time.  Hope that makes some sense.
    Same argument...no one would ever know either way. Until you got     out in about 100 years.
    If it isn't something *really good* they probably wouldn't come after
    you anyway.          I can agree with. I don't think that NSA would tip their hand
    and let on to us that they can read our stuff. At least, not directly.
    One more thing. Don't you think that they subscribe to the Cypherpunk
    list just to see this kind of logic?
    BTW....I ain't one of 'em, and I wouldn't tell if I was.   :)

Then you would have to hope you never do anything illegal. Then     no (pick your acronym) agency would be able to easily trump up        a charge that could be used as an infiltration technique to get     to your system *legally*. If they want to bad enuff I'm sure     breaking the law to catch you doing something would be arranged.
    Violating National Interests maybe?
    PGP?...3xDES?....RC5?....plans for an A-Bomb with instructions for
    construction and location of available nuclear material?...pick one.
    Agreed, the problem is finding a way to be sure! A little
    misinformation has a habit of going a long way.
        Be careful...not everyone here is a U.S. resident or citizen.
        At least I don't think so.
        But since I am I know how precariously balanced the definition
        of free specch is. The Supreme Court in cahoots with law
        enforcement and lawmakers could change things pretty quick!
        Throw in a handy list of names......u know the rest.
[I see my smiley was disregarded]
Proof you say!
A classical dilemma:
        If I say I am (one of them) it implies gathering
        intelligence or a reason to sow suspicion even if I am not.
        Denial implies I am what I say I am not.
        So, even though I am not, it would be impossible to *convince*
        you of that. If I was I still couldn't produce *believable*
        evidence to support the statement.
        Take my advice: Don't Trust Nobody.

@_subject: H.R.4922 
If I am digging up old info please excuse me, I haven't been able
to read the majority of mail due to the volume of, fluff, shall
we say.
For U.S. cypherpunks this is it:
H.R. 4922 "Interception of Digital and Other Communications"
passed as of October. This is the first *I* heard about it.
In short the bill requires:
" ...telecommunications carrier shall insure that it's equipment,
facilities, or services are capable of (1) expeditiosly isolating and
enabling the government, persuant to a court order or other
authorization, to intercept, to the exclusion of all other communications,
all wire and electronic communications carried by the carrier....etc.
Time for me to generate more keys!
