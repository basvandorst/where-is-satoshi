@_subject: anti-clipper t-shirt 
: I've already ordered my "1984" T-shirt, but saw the reference to another
: anti-Clipper T-shirt, as well.  What are the gory details on the non-1984
: shirt (price, where to order, size(s?), etc).
I think that was probably my shirt you are referring to (the "original"
1984 shirt :-).  Both John Blair and I were at CFP '94, and we both
got the "We're behind schedule" line from a NSA employee who was
representing only himself at the conference.
The shirt idea I had was to take the Big Brother Inside logo that
has been floating around, and use that for the front of a "anti-clipper"
shirt, as you put it.  On the back, I originally planned to use a
!Key Escrow (the words Key Escrow inside a universal red circle/slash),
but decided to use the "We're behind schedule" instead.  Who knows,
maybe there is another shirt in the making...
My shirts are supposedly printed (I haven't seen them yet).  I've
received several orders, but I have been deliberately circumspect
on the list;  I made one "RFI" (request for interest) to cypherpunks.
All the rest of my "advertising" has gone to those who initially
expressed interest via email.

If you are interested in ordering a shirt from me, send email.

I know the Sysop can read my secring : etc.. at any time and can also intercept my passkey for my secring, BUT I : would still like to perhaps use a low security key from my Unix account : and then have a high security key on my home system that is very safe.  : The problem is, figuring out which message goes to where and all.  Could : someone with extnsive knowledge of PGP use on a Unix system help me out : here>?

Would it not make sense, therefore, to publish a public cypherpunks
mailing list key, which is returned with subscription requests?
All incoming message cleartext to the mailing list server would
then be encrypted in the server's key; not for security, but precisely for the reason you state above.  That _would_ create
quite a volume of encrypted communications to each receipient of the list.

That was exactly the point Eric Hughes was making; it is not a good
strategy to save encryption for only private communications.
Besides, procmail (or similar) should be able to handle piping
incoming cypherpunks traffic through the decryptor, so the hoop would be transparent anyway.  No muss, no fuss.

: So, will procmail run for someone getting this mailing list via CCMail
: under DOS? There are people doing that, you know.
Yes, I am aware of that.

: Perry
I don't think "adjust[ing] on a case by case basis" is necessary.
I was suggesting just the opposite.  It obviously isn't a security
issue.  I believe it is more of a first principles issue; "Thou
shall encrypt thy communications, lest thou draw attention to thy
self, and the right be removed by thine opponents."
Oh well, since it was deleted in the first reply to my reply, let's try this again:
: If part of your communications are encrypted and part are not you have
: sent the message about what information is sensitive and what is not.
: This difference in encoding is a fir-class message in it's own right.
: : Therefore _all_ communications should be encrypted at all time.  It is
: no argument against the principle that this is difficult to do at the
: current time.
Perhaps I am misunderstanding the above (I think not; "_all_" is
fairly inclusive).  I understand your argument about routine PRIVATE
mail.  However, key exchange alone involves considerably more hassle
than what I am suggesting (and judging from the reply I got from
Eric Hughes, I gather encrypting the list is hardly a new idea)
which is this: there would be a tangible benefit from encrypting
a list like cypherpunks with a well-known, even casual grade key.
For God's sake, *especially* cypherpunks (you know, the name, power
of example and all that) If the tools need to be built for some
platform; well, "cypherpunks write code".  Pipes _are_ available
under DOS, you know.

: You miss the point, Eric. We are advocating that IN THE FUTURE all

This is hyperbole.  It would not make our lives impossible.  And
far from delaying the future, as it relates to communications on
the list, I would argue that it would reduce the signal-to-noise
ratio immensely, thereby hastening the deployment of tools.  So
I don't think I'm missing the point simply by disagreeing with you.
: I encrypt things whenever possible. Some people I communicate with
: can't encrypt, so I adjust, on a case by case basis. Someday,
: hopefully within the next year or two, things will be different.
: Encrypting this list ever would be useless -- but fine if it would
: be easy to do. Since it isn't easy or useful, it is a bad idea.
It's usefulness depends both upon whether you think increasing the
ratio of cryptext vs. cleartext to your system is useful, and
whether easy is defined by the least capable systems on the list.
Don't worry.  I'll drop it here.

Crypto Political Action Sportware...
Is anyone interested in a T-shirt with the swoosh Big Brother Inside
front, and maybe a !Key Escrow (RSA button style; red circle and
slash over the words Key Escrow)?  Would be a real conversation
piece with non-crypto friends, I would think.   I recently heard another great idea for a shirt:
                   1 9 8 4            "We're behind schedule."
           National Security Agency
I think I'll do at least a few for myself and friends, if no one
else is interested.
Also, reply directly to me (and *please* don't cc: the list), so I can get an idea of how many to order, if I do this.  If it's
already been done, I would like to know about that also.
"Shirt orders" sent to the list will be ignored...
