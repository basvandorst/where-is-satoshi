@_subject: HOWTO Build a Nuclear Device 
References: Hello !Dr.,
That's just description of chain reaction from school
course of physics, every kid know that from age 14.
It's impossible to find somewhere in universe 2 kilos of
pure plutonium.
So, impossible to built nuclear bomb with wight less then 40-50
kilos, and definitely impossible to built it in stainless
steal (why you need to steal them ? :) ) salad bowls.
DJB>  4 stainless steal salad bowls (5 - 8 inch diameter)
DJB> 10 pounds of U-235 (Plutonium)
DJB>  1 containment cylinder in which to fit the salad bowls
DJB>  ? some explosives - C4 platic works best - but TNT or gun powder is
DJB> acceptable.
DJB> Assembly
LOL !
To be realistic - everyone can built BIG bomb with ammony,
acetone and sugar - things from nearest supermarket.
Not as big as nuclear one, but enough big to destroy
