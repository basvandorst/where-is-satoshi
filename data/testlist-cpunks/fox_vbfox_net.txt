Cute, but the threat model of the submitter seem unclear to me, in
what is it different here from gpg binaries provided by a linux
distribution package ?
If even only one person have access to the packaging keys and is of
american nationality he can receive a National Security Letter and
would have to comply (Rubber hose is obviously working too if they
want to risk it). Using quantum insert they don't even need to change
the packages for everyone, only you.
Updates for any software executing with access to your private data
are dangerous.
I don't see why this subject is present in the issue tracker of an
extension... it's a lot more general issue (Except for the fact that
Google bashing is cool today).

Seem like even  don't have any idea :
 RedPhone was removed from the Play Store today. We
don't yet know why,
but we've reached out to Google support for more information.
 If anyone at Google or with contacts at Google can
help us with getting RedPhone
reinstated, please get in touch or give us a hand.
