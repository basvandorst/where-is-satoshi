Well, I have a little web site. I'm uploading as much
hacker/cyber/clipper stuff as my quota will hold. Feel free to browse.

@_subject: Random Number Generator (was Re: brainstorming on cpunks' eve) 
Well, I don't know if it's useful or not, but for sake of
curiousity/experimentation, I set up a random number server.  Send mail
to mg5n+random at andrew.cmu.edu and it'll spit out 256 bytes of random
data.  :)
The RNG is the same one I use for my remailer.  The random numbers are
generated from (among other things) taking a hash of a listing of the
users who are currently logged-on, so it's impossible to predict what
will come up from one minute to the next.  (Try fingering
wcs at anchor.ho.att.com
Right.  Always crypto-launder random number files before and after
each use.  :-)
Bill Stewart wrote (re timestamps/digital notary):
This shouldn't be too hard to do.  Considering many of the remailers
already support PGP, it shouldn't be too much work to modify the current
remailers to take a message, add a date/time, sign it with PGP, and send
it back.
