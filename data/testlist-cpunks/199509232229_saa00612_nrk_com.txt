No, they'll just flood it with RF and force your diode to act as a detector - then they can feed you anything they like ;)
I learned the hard way - keep the transmitters away from a reverse-biased doide acting as a noise generator.  Only until I examined the output did I realize it wasn't random.  I fixed it, though, by looking at the output
and testing its randomness.
