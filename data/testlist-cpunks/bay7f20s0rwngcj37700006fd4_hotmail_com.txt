because every law will impact the way businesses do business.
A majority screwing up a country is not "letting them figure things out on
their own".  Maybe we should have let the Japanese figure things out by
themselves once they surrendered?  Germany?  No funds to rebuild France.
Oh, I want to live in *that* world, where we may not have won the cold
I haven't lived in China, but my impression of the country leads me to
believe otherwise.  If it's not *quite* socialist, it's fascist.
As above, this doesn't seem right.  Hong Kong might be a major capitalist
center of operations, but Hong Kong is not really China, socioeconomically
God damned idiots, both the designers/builders and anyone who would work
in it without taking precautions.  Anyone in WTC2 who cares about living
should buy a dozen real climbing ropes or go learn to skydive and then how
to BASE jump.  And pray 5 times a day that the plane crashes into some
*other* floor.
I'd imagine it'd be a bit tricky to get a descender past the knots in a
chain of ropes, and air currents around buildings make a safe landing
improbable for any but the most experienced BASE jumpers.
Accordingly, there was some whining in Oct '01 on dropzone.com about how
morons would jump with an "executive parachute" whenever they smell burnt
toast, but I think that's a great way to clean the pool.  Maybe some
clever person could change the WTC2 mains frequency to 70 or 80 herz to
facilitate that (as well as overheating Tyler's computer to let him know
that the End is near).
ciel bleu!
