The source is available for mixmaster.  However, Type II does not offer reply blocks.
Not necessarily.  You don't have to be able to read a message to determine what it is.  In the case of an amphibian remailer operator (who shall remain nameless) revealing the identity of someone using his remailer, this remop ran 2 of the three remailers being used.  The chain A -> B -> C -> D -> E
where A is the sender, E the recipient, and B and D are the remailers controlled by the same person. Also, if the message to E had been encrypted it wouldn't have mattered much in identifing who what sending something to whom.
The remop could tell that a message from A coming in through B always resulted in a message going to C, and that such messages always had a corresponding message from D to E.  The fact that the messages were encrypted to each remailer's key, and that the middle remailers was not compromised, did not protect the user.
There were a some special circumstances to this, the biggest one being that A was sending a ton of messages, all of similar size, through the exact same chain.  But it does show the problem with Type I reply blocks in use by the current system.
Of course they can't alter the encrypted text, but it may be possible to add text after the pgp-encrypted block to make tracking the messages easier.  There's also the issue of taking a reply block and replaying it with new text in order to watch where it goes.
Exactly. This is the case I was mentioning above.  It shows that the "if one remailer is legit your messages are safe" line of thinking is not necessarily true.
Type II is the current, though cypherpunk (Type I) are in use.  II does not allow for reply blocks.  Type III (mixminion) is in active development and allows for SURBs - Single Use Reply Blocks -- that will allow for nyms without having to store a set number of reply blocks that can be replayed (a la the current type I pseudonym setup)
Anyway, just a few thoughts.  I'm far from an expert on this so take everything with a large grain of salt.
