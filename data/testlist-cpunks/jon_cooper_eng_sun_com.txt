@_subject: distributed cryptographic attack demo 
i'm trying to do a demo of a distributed object technology and it seems
to me that many cryptographic attacks would be facilitated by our approach.  do you have any ideas for what a neat distributed effort might be?
the ones i've thought of just don't seem too exciting:
* GNFS of RSA modulus
* attacking SSL
* brute-force RC5 attack
i'm looking for something that would be a sort of viscerally engaging
attack, something that will make people who aren't necessarily number theorists or cryptographers take note.
any input would be helpful!
PS - note that I'm not on cypherpunks so a direct reply would be
most highly appreciated.

@_subject: distributed computing 
I'm in the planning phase of a demo which should demonstrate the power
of a distributed object technology which I'm working with.  Any ideas
for neat crypto-related distributed computation demos would be much
I've thought of:
* brute forcing RC5 (lots of people are doing this already)
* factoring attack on RSA modulus
* Certicom's ECC challenge
But I'm looking for something with more of a sort of gut-level appeal.
Cracking SSL packets might be good.  Hrmm.
thanks for any input ...
