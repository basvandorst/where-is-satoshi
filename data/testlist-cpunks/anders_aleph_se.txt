Because the consumers really want it. The fatal mistake of thinking it is because "They" put it there misses the far more unsettling aspect that *we* are voting with our wallets to produce a transparent, trackable world with smart gadgets.
Some of that is an accidental side effect (consider EFFs interesting  demonstraiton that our browser customisation makes us identifiable:   ) - many of these side effects suprise the  Powers That Be too (consider all leaks due to improper redaction of PDFs). But I think what most people honestly do want is a world that has "magical properties" of transparency and services for them that also produce transparency for others - and they are not willing to pay much money or effort to reduce this information leakage.
If it was just They who did things, we could in principle stop Them. But  now it is *us* who are doing it, and we are unlikely to stop ourselves.
At least that is the common assumption. Given the growing number of more  or less embarassing mistakes, there is a realy issue of false positives.  Plotters are rare: people looking like plotters are far more common.
The really interesting thing is when this ability percolates downwards.  Right now companies like Acxiom and Facebook are using similar methods. In a few years it will be feasible for smaller groups and individuals to do big data mining too.
I suspect the best strategy is to get people aware that we are careening  into the transparent society, that we better get ultra-tolerant, and that we better get strong accountability measures into place to keep  governments and other concentrations of power safe and sane.

@_subject: [ExI] The NSA's new data center 
I did a little calculation: at what point can governments spy 24/7 on  their citizens and store all the data?
I used the World Bank World Development Indicators and IMF predictors for future GDP growth and the United nations median population forecasts, the fit 10.^(-.2502*(t-1980)+6.304) for the cost (in dollars)per gigabyte (found on various pages about Kryder's law) and the assumption that 24/7 video surveillance would require 10 TB per person per year.
Now, if we assume the total budget is 0.1% of the GDP and the storage is  just 10% of that (the rest is overhead, power, cooling, facilities etc),  then the conclusion is that doing this becomes feasible around 2020.  Bermuda, Luxenbourg and Norway can do it in 2018, by 2019 most of Western Europe plus the US and Japan can do it. China gets there in 2022. The last countries to reach this level are Eritrea and Liberia in 2028, and finally Zimbabwe in 2031. By 2025 the US and China will be able to monitor all of humanity if they want to/are allowed.
So at least data storage is not going to be any problem. It would be very interesting to get some estimates of the change in cost of surveillance cameras and micro-drones, since presumably they are the ones that are actually going to be the major hardware costs. Offset a bit because we are helpfully adding surveillance capabilities to all our must-have smartphones and smart cars. I suspect the hardware part will delay introduction a bit in countries that want it, but that just mean there will be hardware overhang once they get their smart dust, locators or gnatbots.
Note that this kind of video archive is useful even if you don't have a  myriad analysts, perfect speech recognition or AI (in fact, it would be a great incentive and training corpus for developing them). When you figure out that somebody is doing or have just done something nasty, you can easily backtrack and check on everybody they had been in touch with. It would be quite easy to catch most members of any rebel network this way as soon as it was recognized as a rebel network - and one could easily create incentives for not associating with potential subversives and/or reporting them, adding crowdsourced reporting. The only kind of uprisnings with any kind of chance would be spontaneous eruptions.
The more interesting (sinister) uses of this kind of intelligence corpus  is of course to do trials and experiments to see what predicts social norm compliance and obedience. How well does various forms of nudging work? What about the longitudinal loyalty effects of natural or deliberate experiments? How well can you predict people from their saccade patterns?
We might actually be living in a short window of opportunity right now.  The problem is not the surveillance per se, but the danger from  non-accountable uses of them once they are in place. Totalitarian  governments with this kind of transparency might prove extremely hard to  dislodge, and could become stable attractor states. This suggests that we should work very hard on figuring out how to maintain government  accountability even when it has total surveillance powers, and how to  prevent open societies from sliding into the totalitarian trap. Given that the tail statistics of big disasters is dominated by pandemics, wars and democides we have very good reasons to view this as among the top questions for human survival.

Sure. I also get invited to speak to the US and UK government. If they
*didn't* check me out, they would be rather remiss. You wouldn't want
one of the Bad Guys to visit the MoD or NSC shindig, right?
In fact, one intriguing issue is government self-surveillance. When
the Army invites me to a meeting, no doubt the NSA has to check out
the people attending - they are dealing with somebody in the network
of "interesting" people! Ah, yes, obvious Swedish military and crazy
libertarian connections, hey - double second-order links to Assange!
...wait, a third order link to *Saddam*?! And vice versa, by going to
that meeting I am now by definition an "interesting" person and my
government contacts are worth checking out a bit more... The problem
is of course to rein in the spread of who to keep tabs on - and big
data is providing its own apparent solution: "all of them". Plus that
large scale trawling will tend to pick up lots of things just by
default. Which actually means that various agencies are gathering data
other agencies would rather not have gathered. Just ask David
Petraeus. At least humans know better than to spy on the boss, but the
software can't tell the president apart from another suspiciously
well-connected person who is meeting with shady people.
Add to this the normal craziness of intelligence ( ) and there is plenty of potential for tragicomedy.
But the upshot of this is not that I should keep silent: *it doesn't
matter*. I am in this mess whatever I do, even if I follow the best
opsec and sigint practice. The risk of me being targeted is less
affected by my actual activities and more affected by arbitrary group
The most worrisome effect is that a certain kind of people take those
putative flags very seriously, and deliberately live amazingly bland
lives. You can see the young politicians who have nearly no net shadow
except party activities, and plan on being electable because they have
no scandals. You can see it among the admin people who aim at
conforming maximally, thinking this is a clever career move. The
problem is that this can lead to a feedback loop: if the officers
vetting you have a perspective of what a proper life is based on their
own conformist lives, they will gather people like themselves in the
institutions of power. Most bureaucracies love bureaucrats, because
they make sense to bureaucrats.
But this is specific problem that is more narrow than the general
problem of *badly founded* fear of omnipresent and omnicompetent
Powers making people conform.
