Rather than assume that the "Reply-To:" field shown above is appropriate,
I have Cc'ed your originating address as well.  So, if you get two copies
of this, you'll know why. Postulate an unscrupulous sysadmin (or anyone who manages to get the password
for 'root' via fair means or foul).  Let's call him Charlie (since we know
that neither Alice nor Bob would do such a thing :).  Charlie could easily
install a process which logs each keystroke you enter, thus capturing your
passphrase in said log.  Alternately, he could substitute a rogue version
of PGP for the real version.  This rogue version would function exactly like
the real version (to avoid suspicion on your part), but would surreptitiously
copy your secret key and passphrase into a log file.
Admittedly, this kind of attack is far-fetched.  As long as you are aware of
the possibility, you are free to assess the likelihood of such an attack and
proceed accordingly.

Indeed.  Is he now working furiously on a fix for this "big hole" which
he can then patent and refuse to license to Big Brother?
This is true, although difficult to remember sometimes.

This from the same Administration which rationalizes its attempts to
emasculate cryptography by citing the need for and widespread use of
such methods.
Coincidence?  You decide.
