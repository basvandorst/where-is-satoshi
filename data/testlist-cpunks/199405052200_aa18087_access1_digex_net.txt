@_subject: Keyserver service outRAGE 
I don't see why RSA would waste their time trying to get one keyserver
to stop accepting keys from PGP 2.3a, when there are plenty of others
availiable. (And most people just put their keys in their finger/plan
files and don't bother to put them on the keyservers anyway.)  My first
guess would be that they wanted to create some incentive to use the
newer version of PGP.  But that's ridiculous - its legally licensed RSA
code is supposed to be the incentive to use it.  So playing games with
the keyserver is rather ridiculous.  However, RSA is well known for
irrational thought, such as complaining about PGP, but giving away RIPEM
for free.  So maybe this is just their twisted way of trying to gain
themselves (in their own minds) some publicity or credibility or
whatever.  However, I suspect RSA is doing this for legal/political
reasons too.  It's pretty hard for them to claim patent infringement
against anyone with all these people "infringing" on their patent by
using PGP, and them not doing anything about it.  If they can get people
to use RSAREF PGP, they don't set as strong a precedent for not
defending their patent.  It then might be easier for them to claim
patent infringement in other cases.  But that's just a guess.
