@_subject: use of ripem instead of pgp 
Since the only reason we are talking about RIPEM is because of legality concerns about PGP, I thought I'd mention that it is (at least theoretically) illegal to export RIPEM from the US, annd therefore could not be legally used to correspond with persons overseas.
I don't know if there is a legal way to do public key cryptography between persons inside the US and persons outside the US.
