@_subject: Gruveo, more secure skype alternative? 
Recently found Gruveo[1]. Allows easy video and audio calls similar to
cryptocat. Unfortunately not open source and makes no mention of being
audited. Otherwise looks very interesting and promising. It tries to use
P2P to make calls, and if it fails, then it will go through their servers.
Uses WebRTC for end to end encrypted audio and video chat. They claim they
don't keep any logs that could identify users.
So the question is, is this an NSA honey pot or something that might
actually be trustworthy? It seems at least a bit more secure/trustworthy
than skype to me.

Last time I checked, NSLs could only be used against people in the US.
Not people located in Switzerland even if they are US citizens. So as
long as they don't travel to the US it's safe.
And to concerns about monetization, I was looking around their website
and found that they have been entering a bunch of start-up
seed-funding things. I also noticed that in their privacy policy they
have a section covering payment information. I assume this means that
they will have pay services once they leave beta. Under the forever
free picture on the front page, they say that they will have
"multi-tiered pricing including a free version anyone can use."
What I haven't seen yet is anything about third party audits or
warrant canaries. In Switzerland it is possible to get warrants with
gag orders for data (I believe the gag is eventually lifted). They do
not make it clear what would change in their transparency report if
they got such an order. They also make no indication of how they will
respond to security disclosures or to people trying to poke holes in
their system.
