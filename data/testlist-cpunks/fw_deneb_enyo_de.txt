However, they use some form of crypto.  From a recent press release of
our attorney general:
(Very rough translation: "The persons are accused of being members of
"Ansar al Islam" and planning the assassination of the Iraqi prime
minister during his visit to Germany on the 2nd and 3rd December,
2004.  This follows from the contents of a multitude of encrypted
telephone calls the accussed exchanged since November 28, 2004.")
Probably, they just used code words, and no "real" cryptography.  I'm
trying to obtain a confirmation, though.

I think you can forward the PassCode to AOL once the victim has
entered it on a phishing site.  Tokens ` la SecurID can only help if
the phishing schemes *require* delayed exploitation of obtained
credentials, and I don't think we should make this assumption.  Online
MITM attacks are not prevented.
(Traditional IPsec XAUTHis problematic for the very same reason, even
with a SecurID token lookalike.)

Well, if Mr Gates is a witness and not a suspect, such coercive
measures are well within the legal framework of most countries.  As a
witness, you must testify.  It simply does not matter if the
information you are asked to provide is encrypted, or is stored in a
database and needs significant preprocessing to obtain.  It would be
quite surprising if this was any different in the UK.
So it's purely the self-incrimination part that is questionable from a
legal POV.  I think this bears repeating because we face a similar
discussion in Germany regarding covert data seizure using
technological measures, and the discussion focuses almost entirely on
the technological measures.  But the legal obstacle is just the

I don't think this hasn't got to do much with Antigua.  It's also not
specific to North America.  It's very difficult to create market
conditions which result in low-latency routing, so only smaller
countries with a sufficently developed Internet economy have it.
(The U.S. issues in this area are so bad that even a network with
extensive peering hasn't got drastically better connectivity to major
U.S. sites than a consumer DSL line in some European countries.)

* Eugen Leitl quotes:
Encryption is not a solution to the problem.  The attack on Google
shows that NSA/GCHQ that companies in Western countries and their
employees are legitimate targets for covert operations by their
intelligence services (same for the BND attacks on 1&1 and other
German ISPs, we don't have to single out the Obama administration or
the British here).  Once that is established, those intelligence
services can use all the tools in their portfolio.  This includes
turning employees against their colleagues and their employer, and
things far worse.  Suddenly, passive eavesdropping might not have been
so bad after all.
If you are their target, you lose.  The solution is to make it illegal
that they target you, reign in executive privilege (again, a global
issue) and restore the rule of law.  Obviously, that's a bit more
difficult to turn on some crypto.

Well, for one thing, it removes physical access to machines from
insiders on your end, and in many cases, also direct access to data,
particularly in its bulk form.
With conscious effort and the right resources, you might be able to
come with better security controls than the large service providers,
but right now, most organizations don't have much of an audit trail
for locally run services.  I'm not sure if moving data off premises
actually results in a net loss of control over it.  Note be cause the
service providers are so good at security, but because various factors
conspire to make almost everyone else so bad.

Not all service providers hand you the capability to run arbitrary
code to run VM exploits, so you have to exploit an application bug
first.  (And the application may even run on bare metal.)
Service providers can also provision VMs in such a way that customers
can only attack themselves.

Sure, this is a valid position.  But as we have seen, most
organizations do a poor job of controlling their data in-house.  Right
now, an external service provider can often exceed quite easily the
data controls such organizations can provide, and that alone might can
make it a net win to move the data off premises.
