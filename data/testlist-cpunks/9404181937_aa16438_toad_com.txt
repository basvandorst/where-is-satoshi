asked for ID to verify the check and when I handed them my military ID, they  asked for my driver's license instead.  I gave them my driver's license and they used it and the magnetic strip on the back of it to verify my check.  I noticed on their computer screen that it had all of my info, as in birthdate, address, driver's license number, the routing number for the bank I am with, and my checking account number.  They also have notices up that say they index everything by your phone number.  I asked them what they were using all of this information for, and they said for their marketing purposes.  I was so ticked off that I took back the check, went to an ATM, pulled out cash, and went back and purchased the item with cash.  I had to buy the item there, because nowhere else in the local area did they have the item.  Just something to keep in mind.
