I've been looking for a file on how to make PPV descramblers and havn't found any. Commercial descramblers cost around $200 base price. If anyone has a file on how to make them please e-mail me one.  Thanks.

Cable-TV-Piracy-Punks?  Who's this guy?  I asked for a text file (for informational purposes of course).  Oh and David K. Merriman, PPV is not on cable.
