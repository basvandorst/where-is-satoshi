In my experience, listservers will clear any commands that don't come from

Harmless and defensive is how I would describe the 100s of thousands of
 civilians masscred by the United States.  The really dangerous people
 were safe inside their bunkers.
It's an important point: regardless of the threat that the Iraqi government
 posed, the US government chose to destory the country rather than making
 a real attack against only the government.
They were able to do this for two big reasons, both directly attributable
 to political factors (as well as the fact that there is not a large
 vocal Iraqi population in the US):
It's really not so different than the War On Some Drugs or half a dozen
 other power-plays... and this is the propaganda machine that we will have
 to face if we're unlucky enough that Clinton/Gore actual get their act
 together enough and get the rest of the government behind them to make a
 real PR effort (as opposed to the clumsy scare tactics we've soon so far).

Make no mistake: I'm blaming Clinton for neither the War On Some Drugs,
 the Persian Gulf massacre, nor the Waco massacre.  Government controls
 all that it can and grows however it's able: it's the nature of governments.
 It doesn't matter what control freak is at the helm, they'll use whatever
 means are available to control the world and the nation.  This is why we
 have a Bill Of Rights.  It is also why the Bill Of Rights in is tatters.
One of the most insidious details is that you usually can't point to one
 person and say "it's their fault."  Everyone is "just doing their job."
I'm one of those who sees no fundamental difference between the Republicrats
 and the Democans.  Their rhetoric is different, but all they want in the
 end is for everybody to behave they believe is right: they have no respect
 for the freedom of diversity in beliefs that it is at the core of America.
What is important for us to observe is the methods that they use to control
 us and for us to figure out how to undermine these methods as well as we
 are able.
The nets themselves are a good start: without centralized communications,
 it's more difficult to tell people what to think.  Strong crypto for
 everyone added to the nets is a good step, too: especially when you can
 authenticate sources according to an information "web of trust" (IE,
 I'd trust something Noam Chomski recommended over something Dorothy
 Denning recommended).

Indeed.  I'd really like to see the wording about how they actually need

 count as "paying for it"?
They could spend the money by doing two things:
Presto!  We've paid for the mechanisms, but not through the federal

 of their general tariffs for a really long time, so I could certainly
 see them playing along as long as there's room for other R&D in there.

hart at chaos.bsu.edu (Jim Hart):
The biggest problem I have (obviously) with it is that the premise
 is wrong: NetMarket was *not* the first company to take a credit-
 card order via automatic encryption software.  Over a month before the sale they site, Bibliobytes made its first
 sale with an automatic encryption program: the only real difference
 is that NetMarket used hhtp, where bibliobytes used e-mail -- so
 their interface is much prettier (and that we used RIPEM where  they used PGP).  Well before us, people were taking orders via PGP --
 the thing about our client was that the user didn't have to know
 anything about encryption programs.
We've contacted the author of the article and he claims that he'll
 be retracting the claim... we'll see.  The Voice already snickered at
 the NYT's fuck-up in this week's edition.
My other company (and the one I have the larger interest in), HKS,
 is about to announce a point of sale system (called ICE, for  Internet Creditcard Encryptor -- don't blame me, I didn't name
 it) that'll be a drop-in solution for companies, end to end from
 customer to delivery for soft products and delivery lists for hard
 products.
The problem here, and the one that's of interest to Cypherpunks, is
 how to change this system, using credit cards and all the loss of
 privacy they entail, into one using anonymous digital cash.  HKS
 certainly has a commitment (though in word only at this point, since
 it's vaporware) to support digital cash, but as I've noted before
 it a very difficult bootstrap problem.
There has to be some reason people would use digital cash over credit
 cards and frankly, I don't see it happening in the near future except
 by some large power (like banks) decided to support it.
The american people keep claiming in polls that they want better privacy
 protection, but the fact is that most aren't willing to do anything
 about it: it's just a preference, not a solid imperative.  Until
 something Really Bad happens to many people as a result of privacy
 loss, I really don't think much will be done that requires real
 work and inconvenience from people, like moving to something other
 than credit cards for long-distance transactions... and that's a
 tragedy.

Security is a subject that takes time to learn, especially in this day

Sure there is.  People give out the SSNs all the time because it's
 too inconvenient not too.  People patronize companies that buy and sell
 mailing lists.  People patronize companies that telemarket.  It's
 just too much of a pain not to.
I think you miss my point (I'll talk a bit more about it later, in answer
 to your specific points):  people care, but not enough to inconvenience
 themselves.
With the technology, yes.  I don't think that that is an issue (or if
 it is, let's pretend it isn't for this discussion).  The problem is
 a political and socioeconomic one: it takes a large allocation of
 resources to create a system that is as easy to use as credit card.
 Our society simply does not allocate resources in a way that will get
 this task done without any major push from those with really power.
As anyone who gives Chomsky any credibility knows, our rules in our
 society are largely dictated by the needs and demands of big business,
 with occasional concessions to mass desire.  The desire for privacy
 in financial transactions is not large enough at this time: we're
 reminded of that every time we see a form with a space for your
 SSN.
Perhaps abuses of our current information structure will change this:
 I hope it will, with minimum real impact.  I'm not optimistic about that,
 though: our society only changes quickly in the face of crisis.
I'm sorry, but I really don't think this shows anything for two reasons:
(1) The net is big.  Really big.  A mailing list on just about anything
 can get this kind of traffic. I'm sure there's a NAMBLA list somewhere
 with decent traffic: this doesn't mean I expect child pornography
 (to steal a horseman) to become accepted any time soon.
(2) We talk.  We talk, and talk, and talk.  Few people actually put
 real effort into implementing anything -- and even if we did, we don't
 control much in the way of resources: juts brains.  Granted, you can
 do a lot with a bunch of clever brains, but without real backing by
 existing social and economic structures it is a difficult, up hill
 battle.
This is actually kind of interesting: it's something that really  bugs me.  For years, American Express made noises about how they had
 the consumer's best privacy interest at heart, how they never sold
 mailing list to other companies.  They even sent out for free
 a document on protecting your SSN.  Unfortunately, they've realized that there's a real economic incentive
 to compromise the information they hold.  This proves two points:
 one, the standard point that the only way to protect information is
 to not create it, and two, that there's at least some real incentive
 to bias corporations against privacy schema.
Many large corporations stand to benefit from the lack of privacy,
 and so their resources are likely to be deployed against creating
 privacy without a strong customer demand (a demand, not a preference)
 for privacy.
That's exactly my point: something big will have to happen in
 order to change the ways things are headed now.  It could be
 a planned event or (more likely) set of events, or it could
 be some dramatic calamity.  Otherwise, we're stuck in the old
 "boiling frog" trap: people will only care enough once it's too
 late.
You're right, these things are significant.  I just doubt that they'll
 have real impact in this country: our government simply has too strong
 a hold on our economic transactions for something like digital cash
 to work against their wishes.  If they spread here before the Feds
 wake up, great: we win.  Otherwise...
I don't think we really disagree on any substantive factual issues:
 just how to weigh them.  We really are, I believe, at a pivotal
 point: if somehow we manage to get a system deployed before Big
 Business wakes up and sees the threat we pose, then wonderful.
 If not, it's going to be a long and bloody battle, one in which we
 are not by any means assured victory.
Maybe I've just read too much Chomsky and Fuller and become blinded by
 their analyses.  Chomsky talks about how our system works now and
 in the past to the more-or-less exclusive advantage of Big Business,
 while Fuller discusses the US's financial past (in Critical Path and
 Grunch Of Giants) and how technology spreads into common usage.
Bucky Fuller's main strategy to improve living conditions of humanity
 was to develop technologies so that they'd be available for deployment
 when some crisis demanded them: I sincerely hope that this isn't the
 strategy that we end up having to live with, but I fear it very well
 may be, given the conflicting interests of companies such as AMEX and
 the desire for transactional privacy.

@_subject: Creating privacy crises: Society hacking 
In the composition of my last message, I was thinking in the back of
 my mind about how we could foment an information privacy crisis.  This
 could very well be a Good Thing, a societal hack to serve as a wake-
 up call.
At the HOPE conference, there was someone selling CD-ROMs of the DMV
 records for Oregon for $125.  The same folks promise to add more states
 soon: next in line is Texas.
Perhaps one could generate a privacy crisis by collecting that information
 and conducting a mass mailing to every person in the database: "we have
 this information on you.  So could anybody with $125.  Call your congress
 critter and complain."
Some people don't consider their DMV records critical -- so perhaps a
 mailing from a company of their credit history would open their eyes
 (More effort than the $125 + postage, but probably a better yield).
It's just a thought and it would require some amount of time & money,
 but it's a doable hack with finite resources.
Thoughts?  Is this totally off the wall, or do y'all think that somebody
 with a small but not tiny amount of money would be into doing this?

> Probably more than any of us want to pony up. [...]
 > you're still talking about a $216,000 mailing. Yup.  I wasn't thinking of some individual doing this: $216K is relatively
 small change for a reasonably sized organization, though.  On the
 other hand: remember, we live in an age when people like Perot live.
Another consideration is that you could probably interleave: send only
 1 in 5 people one of the letters, and you may very well have a similar
 impact for "only" $44K.
With 250 million people in the US, guess that half of them have DMV
 records, and take a fifth of them: that's $1 million dollars at
 $.20/mailing.  How much do lobbying organizations spend?  Political
 parties?  (Hmmm.  Maybe we could get the House post office to send
 'em).
Another approach might be to try to find small groups of people in
 each county in the US to handle the mailings.  Of course, the details aren't important: the level of awareness generated
 is.  I also agree with the anonymous poster who suggests that we
 wait until there's a real alternative.

Fair enough. ^Call your congress critter and complain^Support anonymous
 transactions with digital cash from (company_name).  I agree with
 the anonymous poster who said that such a move should be put off
 until we have a real solution.  So, whatever company wants to kick
 this off could use this to generate political protection.
To put my comment in the right context, I was worried (when thinking
 about this) about anonymous digital cash being made illegal.  The
 intent would be to kill opposition to anonymous digital cash.
Eric mentioned in his talk at the SEA that companies exist that sell
 mailing lists of people of a particular ethnicity based upon spending
 patterns: the example he gave was a company marketing to jewish people
 bought a list of "believed jews" for the purpose of marketing (and Eric
 mentioned the irony).
Another variation of my suggestion would be to get such lists and
 to mail to people a statement saying "You are registered as an
 (ethnicity) in mailing lists."  Even a 50% hit rate would drive
 the issue home to people with enormous efficiency.
The intent isn't to get the government to Do Something, but to make
 people en mass aware that privacy is a real issue that affects them.

Actually, I expected to get jumped on in a major way for saying that.
Linux boxes run X11, with all its security problems.  Add to that the
 increasing frequency of popularity of UNIX and UNIX-alikes, with all
 their security problems, and you get a picture that's terrifyingly
 cyberpunk.
I can just picture in three years: Job Bob Public sitting at his Linux
 box, connected by TC/IPng over the local cable IP provider -- scared
 by a mailing he's recently gotten from the Oregon Driver's Privacy
 Initiative with information of where his daughter had his lojack-ng
 equipped car was three days ago when she was supposed to be at football
 practice -- decides to set up Microsoft PGP 5.7us on his machine (and
 to wire up the optional personal lojack-ng tracking feature, of
 course -- brought to you by AT&T).
He writes a message that he believes secure -- Of course, he's got his X11R8
 server xhost +'d, so that his friend Suzy EveryCheese can send windows
 to him (she's much too smart to allows other clients to attach to *her*
 server).  He types his passphrase in and his son, Bubba Public, snarfs
 it from his PC-SeptiumJr.  It never hurts to be able to see what the
 Old Man might be writing.
Of course, the entire thing falls apart when the Morris Worm Mk 3 chomps
 down through the least-secure encryption methods specified in IPng's
 security specs (they salvaged the old AFS "xor 'flamingo'"
 "optimization"), but that's another matter.
The point?  I'm actually not very sure... but it has something to do with
 there never being an easy way to be secure, especially for the plug-n-
 players.  It also has to do with the way things are going to be extremely
 unstable when everybody is networked on machines with an OS and windowing
 environment that evolved to play XTrek efficiently and to support Xeyes
 with motif. Knowledge and/or effort -- not to mention a good dose of paranoia -- are de
 riguer, and I doubt that we'll see anything different in the near future
 (even if technically possible: the rise of MS Windows and UNIX/X11 have
 me pretty down on the economics of quality these days).
Fanaticism's fine.  It's clueless, dogmatic fanaticism that's a problem.

@_subject: Using PGP on Insecure Machines 
In article ,
Okay, I'm the Evil NSA Sysadmin from hell.  I want to collect all the
 info available on my users.  The NSA gives me $50 per keypair, snitch
 money.  Or I just like to be able to read all your mail, and would like
 to have the option of, at some point, forging something from you.
So, I replace the shells on machines under my control with programs that
 invoke something like tee(1) to split stdin and stdout to files and then
 execs the intended shell.  For good measure, I overwrite the process
 entry in the running kernel.
So I now have a files of every keystroke you type, and if I'm clever about
 how I do it (I will be), I can correlate them with the stdout.  I just
 search for "pgp" and bingo: I've got your passphrase.
Since I'm root, getting your keyfiles is trivial.  Your keys are toast, and you don't even know it.  There are a gazillion
 other ways the ENSFH could have done this: monitoring your /dev/tty vector
 in the kernel would be far more subtle, for example.  The key thing to
 remember is that the computer isn't your tool: it's the tool of the people
 with root.
Not only that, but I don't even have to steal your keys: the plaintext will
 exist at some time, and I can trap that -- by only twinning your stdio.
The network security is almost as important, since there are probably many
 more malicious people outside your machine than inside.  So, if you're
 running UNIX, you'd damn well trust everyone with root, run a logging
 /bin/login, be behind a firewall, replace the crypt that passwd uses with
 some transformation, put shadow passwd files in place, make crypt log
 usage and place appropriate monitoring software to watch the logs, monitor
 the machine from another machine behind your firewall, and a host of other
 things.
Security is not easy -- Tim's point is that you can't get it by just
 running some package;  If you think you can, you're fooling yourself
 and everytime someone puts on a securer-than-thou-because I run PGP air,
 they're showing themselves to be totally clueless.
This is all very rudimentary -- come on, you've got to be paranoid where
 security is concerned.  There are many vectors of attack and you've only
 got to miss the one that someone tries to lose big.

[Not all observations are mine: some belong to Andrew Boardman]
Okay, I have a strong interest in this, because we want to be able to
 distribute ICE through traditional "freeware" channels while minimizing
 the threat of spoofing.
I expect much better from Bellcore.
Whoever wrote the blurb clearly wasn't aware of (or chose to ignore)
 the already existing practice of individuals signing their own code.
Why channel everything through this one Betsi agent?  If Betsi's key
 is compromised, *ALL* of their customers lose.
This is unnecessary, and I would claim undesirable.  A unique anonymous
 ID is just as good as a "real" one -- since you're relying upon PGP
 anyway, the mapping from signature to a known identity is one-to-one.
The only reason I can see to require this "real human" mapping is
 to try to prosecute people for bugs in their code or some contamination
 that seeps into their release.
That's not an aspect of the world I want to live in.
This, I'd love to see.  How do you securely get a user who doesn't know
 how to use PGP to verify the signature?  I think most users out there
 are not likely to learn to use PGP on their own: this is from too
 many (3+) years of tech support at Carnegie Mellon -- hardly a
 technological backwater.  People want to use their application and not
 worry about anything else.  Make the damned computer work and let
 me finish my paper and get out of here.
I guess my overall reaction to this Betsi thing is: why?
As far as I can see, this Betsi agent only sets up a single choke point
 through which all software using Betsi can be compromised, for no
 particular gain.  The current method of individuals signing their
 code with their well-known keys is far more secure and doesn't force
 the handing over of identities to the Software Police.

How would getting Betsi to sign them increase your confidence?  Betsi
 doesn't seem to claim to do any testing of the software, they just
 verify that it was really Bill Gates' company (in this example) that
 shipped the Microsoft product.  BFD -- they can buy their own ViaCrypt
 PGP.
I think people are missing my point: that having a third party sign
 your software without any testing (Betsi is free, after all) adds
 *nothing* except for a human-to-name mapping, and increases the
 risk of the signature being compromised.
Now, there probably is a market for somebody who tests the software
 first and then certifies it -- in fact, that will probably be a big
 business in the future, one I can easily see someone like Cygnus getting
 into.  But that's not what Betsi claims to do, and I certainly don't
 want to contemplate the legal issues (do you get your ass sued off when
 you're wrong?  Almost certainly) involved with anybody trying to do that.

True.  This is a big problem that can't be addresses through credit cards,
 due to per-transactions costs.  However, one could cache transactions,
 perhaps even through a central agent, until the amounts were great enough
 (say, $5) to use the mechanism.

Not true.  Teleflora is a company that sells automatic processing software
 and also will be a front-end to credit card companies.  You pay 'em, you
 get your merchant ID and go, and start getting checks every so often.
Additionally, more and more agents are appearing out there who are perfectly
 willing to serve as intermediaries.  Bibliobytes, for example, is soon
 going to expand its services to offer not just books but any software that
 people wish to sell (once we have our processing fully automated and the
 bugs cleared out -- books are just a boot-strap mechanism).
I see a lot of great ideas for e$ out there, but I think they all suffer
 from a central fault: there's no easy transition from the way people do
 business in the real world to an e$ model.  IMO, you've got to base a system
 in the way people are used to working and make a gentle transition, or
 it's simply going to fail purely on the learning curve.

Whoever wrote this is a moron who doesn't understand the newsgroup
 creation process.  (Do I?  I'm a UVV member.)
David Lawrence, one of the US Hierarchy Coordinating Committe, already
 has absolute control over newsgroup creation as the moderator of
 news.announce.newgroups.  He occasionally uses it to stop brain-damaged
 proposals from going through.

@_author: L. Todd Masco 
@_subject: One more time... us.* 
[Very little c'punk content, just explaining why the us.* proposal is nothing
 like a movement towards censorship, but an attempt to resist it]
First, you have to understand that nobody has any say over what newsgroups
 are created on a machine except for the news admin on that machine.  Most
 news admins hand this authority over to Dave Lawrence, the current moderator
 of news.newgroups.announce, when they install their news software.  However, *anybody* can decided to ignore anybody else's decisions on
 *any* newsgroup and issue a newgroups message (and someone else will
 usually issue an rmgroup message in response: it's an anarchy, and most
 of us like it that way).
The us.* hierarchy "cabal" idea is *not* to determine what groups
 will get passed and what ones will not;  In fact, the intent is to eliminate
 "no" votes, passing groups only on the basis of significant interest.  If
 you know any USENET history, you'll know about fiascos like the
 soc.culture.tibet, soc.culture.macedonia, and soc.religion.islam.ahmadiya
 proposal -- cases where the newsgroups had a significant amount of interest,
 but were defeated due to large populations having some sort of grudge
 or religious/national interest in supressing a point of view.
This part of the proposal will, in fact, reduce censorship, preventing  organized campaigns from defeating newsgroups, effectively preventing
 people from discussing their subject on USENET (for the traditional
 definition of USENET that excludes alt.*).
The other part of the proposal, the one which seems to have pushed people's
 "censorship" kneejerk buttons, is the concept of the "namespace cabal."
 Again, if you have any knowledge of USENET history, you'll know that there
 used to be a far stronger cabal than is proposed by the us.* idea: the
 backbone cabal controlled everything -- they were the news admins at
 the backbone sites and they had the last word.  News admins at other
 sites listened to them because, well, they were the backbone cabal.  They
 had the connectivity.
When the set of newsgroups became too big for news admins to effectively
 manage them (and the connectivity model changed, there no longer being a
 real news backbone), a newer system for gaining consensus over newsgroup
 creation was created.  Votes would be taken -- *NOT* on democratic principals
 or anything of that nature, but simply to gauge interest so that news admins
 would have some basis on which to approve group creation.  Over time,
 the formula was tweaked in various ways when groups that people thought
 should never have passed (like the rec.acquaria, sci.acquaria, etc. groups)
 were created.  Still, this is basically the system we have today.
As I mentioned above, the current model allows large groups of people to
 squash newsgroups of interest to smaller (or even equal sized, since the
 current guidelines require 2/3 majority to pass) groups.  THAT is censorship,
 the tyrany of the majority.  There is also another thing that needs fixing.
There is a problem with the current USENET namespace management strategy:
 it is damn near impossible to manage a namepsace by vote.  In extreme
 cases, Dave Lawrence has simply refused to publish the newsgroup creation
 message, but nobody is very happy with this: it's too much like Dave is
 censoring the net, and it's wrong to stop the creation of a newsgroup on
 a subject simply because its proponent insists on a name noone likes.
As a USENET volunteer votetaker, I have become embroiled in proposals for
 groups where a vast number of people wanted a newsgroup but had to wait
 months, sometimes missing the opportunity to discuss events important
 to them, because the newsgroup proponent was insisting upon a name that
 nobody agreed with or because no clear consensus (among users) appeared
 about the naming of the group.
It is the namespace issue that the proposed "cabal" will cover.  It's no
 different than the government refusing to take a vote on where every
 single book in a public library will end up on the shelves or where  each document is stored.  Namespace management is simply impossible to
 do by voting, especially when the "voters" have no understanding of the
 issues involved.  We've squeeked by so far, but only barely -- and as the
 net grows, it become much more difficult to maintain the current voting
 scheme.
That is why it is absurd to view the "namespace cabal" concept as an attempt
 to censor a democratic form.  It isn't an attempt to censor (it is an
 attempt to stop censorship), and the current form isn't democratic.  Please,
 before you try to argue this -- check out the facts about the proposal,
 the history behind it, and the real mechanisms in place before you spout
 off.

Hey, y'all.  I'm not sure how well this will be received on Cypherpunks,
 but it seems like it's appropriate, given the discussions of e$ and
 the use of encryption for fun and profit (this being the latter).
I recently quit my job on Wall Street (well, Broad Street) to go into
 the business of selling electronic forms of books (to start with,
 Voyager on the Macs (it's a toolkit that produces HyperCard stacks))
 and other forms of information.  We haven't made any money yet, but
 we're hoping (I'm the programmer/ part sys-admin).
What we (I)'ve done is this:  I took RIPEM (yes, we've licensed with  Jim Bidzos), and ripped out the key management stuff, replacing it
 with a keypair for the masses (just because RIPEM likes the sender's
 private key to be used to encrypt -- no security is expected here) and
 our public key hardcoded in. The user ftp's a binary for their
 platform (*) from bb.com and runs the client -- they answer the
 questions (credit card info, what items they want on what platforms),
 and the client encrypts, finds sendmail, and fires the mail off.  On
 platforms such as the Amiga, Mac, and PC where there isn't a standard
 e-mail interface, we'll just generate the crypto and let the user cut
 and paste it into their MUA.
(*) we're not distributing source at the moment.  It's simply too easy
 to spoof with the source.
Anyway, this is the announcement.  If anybody gets their nose out of
 joint about it, I sincerely apologize, and ask you not to blame my
 partners -- and I'll only do this one time. We're going on-line in earnest
 in the near future, but I got my partners to agree to let y'all take an
 early look, not entirely as an ad, but partially to show a willingness to
 work with y'all towards shaping a real information economy on the net.  Comments can go to me (cactus at bb.com) or to comments at bb.com. Flames should
 just go to me.
Oh, enclosed is our PGP 2.6 public key: we soon plan to take orders  encrypted with PGP -- as soon as we clear up the legalities (how does
 one license IDEA for commercial use?  Just buy ViaCrypt's PGP?).  We
 haven't decided whether we'll accept non-encrypted orders yet.

Oh, absolutely.  They taste far better than anything available in stores.

 obselete (unless you believe Canada or Mexica is a real threat: I

Interesting tidbit, forwarded to me by a friend.

OK, there have been some wild rumors about the FBI raid on Tri Tac Games
just after GENCON.   Lets set them straight.
FBI RAIDS SMALL GAME COMPANY
PRESS RELEASE
At 10am Tuesday morning, August 23rd, a special tactical team from the FBI
gained swift and overwhelming entry into the corporate offices of Tri Tac
Games in Pontiac Michigan to the great surprise of the entire staff who
were still sipping coffee.
Richard Tucholka, owner and president of Tri Tac, was duly informed of his
rights as the squad of federal agents neatly and politely searched the
offices of Tri Tac claiming to be looking for 'phony FBI  Identification
Badges' and 'Illicit government operation manuals.'
It is to be noted that Tri Tac Games publishes an award-winning
Role-Playing Game called Bureau 13, detailing the adventures of a secret
division of the FBI which uses magic and Harrier Jump Jets to defend
America from supernatural criminals and monsters.
After painstakingly searching everything from the yet-to-be released CD
ROM computer game version of Bureau 13, through the paperback copies of
the Cult -hit novels from Ace Books in New York, absolutely nothing
incriminating or illegal was discovered-- an incident close to the
precedent setting invasion of Steve Jackson Games a few years ago by the
US secret service which resulted in a major lawsuit rightfully won by the
innocent game company.
In preparation for another government visit, Mr. Tucholka has informed his
lawyer, alerted the media, and set an extra pot of coffee to brew for the
agents if they return.
Yes, it happened.  No kidding.   Apparently some fool at GENCON thought a
$1 double sized Plastic ID badge on flaming orange and pink  paper was a
threat to national security.  These badges were given to players of Bureau
13 as promotional material.   The agents were professional and Tri Tac cooperated with them.   Computers
were not touched (It is a federal law that a writers 'Works in Progress'
may not be taken.)   They removed plastic Bureau 13/FBI  ID badges from a
display shelf  and versions of a Department of Justice ID badge produced
by Databank Press.   On Thursday the 25th Richard Tucholka was informed that the Federal
Prosecutor would not be pressing charges for the badges because there was
no malice or intent in their production.  There would be a file
established at the FBI with these badge examples for future reference.  He
was instructed to send in all production copies and masters as well as
destroy the ID Badge Computer Graphics file in question.  Richard Tucholka
shook his head and said "Only an idiot could think these badges were real.
 Wonderful to see my tax dollars at work."
And that's the story.

 gotten around to gutting the second amendment.
I think the biggest danger we face is graduaully increasing totalitarianism
 across the board, through mechanisms such as GATT and European Union --
 there seems to be a world-wide push to smooth differences among nations

It's not the sudden that'll cause the damage: it's the gradual.  "Picture

In article <199409171745.KAA03257 at netcom8.netcom.com>,
I don't see why anonymous remailers are singled out: as written,
it seems that *any* electronic service could be singled out for
this (for example, netcom doesn't require proof-of-identity
"Envision burning police cars."
In any case, perhaps a way around this can be found: what we may
need is "stealth remailers," software that will behave as a remailer
through non-obvious "security holes" with correct cooperation from
software the original user runs.  For example, hack sendmail so that it never wants to reverse-lookup DNS
and given a particular set of commands (saying "EHDR" for 'enhanced
headers') will operate as an anonymous remailer.  Such sendmail-hackage
could be distributed with other changes that give enhanced security
(for example, that turn off EXPN and VRFY) so that people could claim
that they had no idea that they were operating an anonymous remailer.
To add encryption to this model, perhaps changes to sendmail could be
fashioned that incorporate encryption in such a way that it appears to be
purely intended for protection of mail going to the machine, but a
side affect could be that every so hacked sendmail becomes a remailer.
This has one problem, though: so far, you can't chain with this model.
You could fashion a way to cross information from message content
to envelope: but that's not a change to sendmail that can be lightly
made -- you'll get random lossage from people whose messages unwittingly
almost fit your protocol.
So, what's further needed is a comment field in the message envelope
that can be chained.  This would be fairly trivial to add to the
RFC822 protocol, and "extra stealth code" could take care of Advantage?  A lot of people, I think, would like to add encryption to
the MTA layer of mail if it could be done seamlessly.  If these
changes allowed the hacked sendmail to negotiate with the destination
sendmail to determine whether or not it is also hacked, falling back
to standard operation if the other one is not, then it's seamless.
This is a good feature to have generally available: a fair number of
people would install it just on these merits.
Of course, the existence of these "stealth features" would be an open
secret: however this would lend, to take a phrase from the crytofascists,
"plausible deniability."  'Sorry, I just heard about a more secure
sendmail and ftp'd it.  Didn't say anything anywhere about this in
the README files....'
Everybody still with me?  Anybody?  Sound like work people are willing
to do/think is worth doing?  I'd certainly be willing to do some work
on this -- might even be able to justify it as part of my real job,
which does involve designing and implementing encrypted protocols.

Well, "security holes" is a bit loose of a term;  I was thinking out loud,
as it were.  The concept, as evolved later, is to distribute a set of
features to be added to the RFC-822 protocol that will allow security,
including remailer support (though not stated as such).
This isn't really an STO: it's more the providing a suite of features:
including features that we want along with features that will help spread
the whole set.  > Stealth remailers is a good thing to work on, I agree. I'd first
 > settle for having more offshore remailers. Sure.  But that doesn't help the channel between inside the US and outside -- IE, the channels that the NSA is chartered to eavesdrop
on (yes, as Eric likes to say: the NSA and the FBI are different.  But
imagine that at some point in the future the NSA, hard pressed to justify
its existence, starts passing data to other agencies).  Right now, there
aren't that many IP channels to outside the country, so they're pretty
easy to tap.

That thought crossed my mind, too, but since we aren't talking about any
illegal activities, merely protocols that might facilitate the same while
also facilitating privacy, I think we're fine.  Of course, given the
stretches made by Law Enforcement for civil forfeitures, the E911
Neidorf thing, and others, perhaps it's time to start seriously
looking at hacking list software to create mailing lists that are fully
anonymous and encrypted.  Has anybody started on such a project?

Something that just occurred to me is that chaining is a justifiable
standard feature for hosts that hold other hosts' MX records.  I think I'll start hacking on a protocol proposal (Request For
Cypherpunks?);  The more I think about it, the more easy this should
be to implement and distribute as a security suite.
(How's this towards furthering the "everybody a remailer" idea?)

I'm not sure that's a good solution.  When the Bad Guys go to the site
that originated the message and say "we want Alfred E. Neuman at
your site" (for publication of plans of some sort of machine), the
remailer operator could get busted for aiding & abetting.  Sure, Alf's
real life human will be safe, but it'd be nice to protect the remailer
operator, too.
True, the "identity stripping" can be done by a remailer as well;
However, it's trivial enough to do at the mailing list software level
(simply not including information) that it seems like it's not a bad
thing to do.  Now, this won't give protection from traffic analysis;  In was suggestion,
I was really blurring two seperate lines of thought (I'm interested in PGPified mailing list software for content-hiding reasons; I'm trying to
set up a "distributed business" that I'd like to keep secure). Also, though, I'm not sure I want to count on anonymous remailers being
available.  If people want to effectively "chain" them, that's fine.
Sure.  I'm familiar with AMS (in fact, one of my business partners is
one of the current news/postmasters at CMU, and is helping design and
produce IMAP, its replacement).  Another, better I think, possibility is
to add headers and let the MUA sort it out: you don't have to depend upon
non RFC-822 features in the MTA.  Nonstandardness is not a game you want
to get into for things like e-mail unless you have the sort of clout that
CMU/Andrew does.
I'm not sure I buy that duplication of function is a bad thing in this
case: throwing information away more than once can't be worse than
only throwing it away once, can it?

[Disclaimer: this is what I gather, from looking at a competitor's

A subset of what you want exists: the Internet Bookstore (I believe it's
 called) has a viewer/dongle combination for customers that they ship to
 customers for (I think) $30.  I have no idea whether they've sold any,
 but I'd bet not (given the low level of sales Bibliobytes has seen
 without requiring $30 up front).
Their design presumably puts the user's key in the dongle; each book
 shipped is encrypted with it, so the books are (I think) tied to the
 dongle.
However, AFAIK there's no time-binding invovled, and I'm skeptical as
 to how easy that would be: once you've displayed information once, it's

Well *excuse me* for being clinically thick...
I shouldn't post after more than 20 hours w/out sleep.  You're right, of course.  Though the remailer and the mailing list software would
probably require some hacking to make the coupling tighter, in the
process giving both limited-use remailers (probably undesirable in
the generic case, but I can think of special uses) and access-controlled
mailing list software (definitely uses for this, as some exist).
Could you send me what you've done on this?  I think it's a desirable
feature to have, though requiring that people hack their sendmail.cfs
is not a big boost to the "popularity of package" indicator.
