@_subject: MintChip -- a virtual cryptocurrency backed up by a government 
One of the major objections to the Bitcoin cryptocurrency is it isn't backed
up by anything, no hard assets or government.  MintChip aims to succeed
where Bitcoin faltered by having the backing of the Royal Canadian Mint.
Is it secure?  Of course it's secure!  It has the dual advantages
of a (presumably) cryptologically reliable technology combined
with a totally secret implementation.
