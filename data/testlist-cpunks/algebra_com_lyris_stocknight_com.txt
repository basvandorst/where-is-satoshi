  Issue 10                                               July 19, 2001
   Editor's Note                                              [Image]
   It's safe to assume that most of us, certainly most of us
   investors, are cell phone users and a large portion of that group
   are also PDA and Pocket PC users as well. If you use either cell
   phones or wireless computers, we think that today's issue of
   StockNight will be more than a little intriguing.
   In December of 2000, Bill Machrone, a contributing editor with PC
   Magazine, stated that "Streaming video to portable devices will
   change the world as much as cell phones have" and fantasized about
   the uses of such technology:
   "You may be getting a visual check on traffic at those troublesome
   bottlenecks as you walk to your car in the parking lot, doing a
   security sweep of your home in your absence, or viewing the
   relatives' visit to Sea World in real time, or surreptitiously
   catching up on your favorite soap opera while at your desk. Or any
   of a hundred applications that no one has thought of yet. "
   However, techies have worried for some time about the need to
   compress streaming video for wireless due to the present
   difficulties and constraints in sending wireless video
   applications to cell phones, PDAs and Pocket PCs, as well as low
   speed modems. Today our StockNight featured company has stated in
   their press release issued at 6:02 p.m. EST, that they have
   licensed new patent pending "technology that automatically reduces
   the size and bandwidth of digital video files" to be sent to
   wireless devices.
   Remember, this press release was issued AFTER THE BELL today so
   the market at large has not been able to react to this news yet.
   As part of the StockNight service we bring this information direct
   to your email as soon as it is made available to us.

              Vizario Licenses New Patent Pending Digital
                 Video Condensing Software Technology.
    Patent pending technology automatically and significantly reduces
                              the size of
          digital video files for wireless video applications.
   SAN CARLOS, Calif.----July 19, 2001-- Moving to ease the strain
   that video files place on low-bandwidth wireless networks,
   Vizario(TM), Inc. (OTCBB: VZRO)  today announced
   it is licensing new patent pending software technology that
   automatically reduces the size and bandwidth of digital video
   files. Later this year, Vizario will incorporate the new
   technology in its mobile handheld device software system, which is
   designed for wireless video applications on cell phones, PDAs and
   Pocket PCs, as well as for use on low speed modems.
   Vizario Director David Schwartz, Digital Video Systems Engineering
   Manager Mike Chin and Senior Engineer Mike Tanaka have applied for
   the U.S. patent on the digital video condensing technology. ``It
   is clear that many people want digital video over low bandwidth
   wireless networks,'' Schwartz explained, ``but the sheer size of
   almost any video over three minutes long makes even previewing
   them problematic. Our new methods will make it easy for viewers to
   decide what they want to view or download without wasting time or
   money.'' Schwartz added, ``For system operators, we can
   substantially reduce the burden video places on wireless
   networks.''
   The new video condensing software technology is being developed by
   Imaginon, Inc., the parent company of Vizario. The exclusive
   rights to use the new technology in wireless networks are licensed
   to Vizario.
   Designed to put new capabilities into wireless mobile devices,
   Vizario offers both consumers and businesses a completely
   integrated, end-to-end wireless solution for finding and
   displaying data - especially rich media like audio and video. The
   Vizario consumer product features a client/server publishing tool
   allowing content carriers, promoters and content providers to
   distribute media assets to end users through the Vizario client.
   It also incorporates a Web interface where end users personalize
   their mobile Vizario further to add additional queries that
   deliver customized content. This solution offers unsurpassed ease
   of deployment in both Java and .Net-enabled handsets.
   As a vertical application suite, Vizario is a complete solution
   for companies that require distribution of image-intensive data to
   mobile devices wherever finding, encoding, decoding and displaying
   images for decision support in the field is considered critical to
   the mission's success.
   Vizario is a trademark of Vizario, Inc. The underlying technology
   is protected under U.S. Patents and a U.S. Patent pending.
   Except for the historical information presented herein, the
   matters set forth in this press release are forward-looking
   statements within the meaning of the ``safe harbor'' provision of
   the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, or by the
   Securities and Exchange Commission in its rules, regulations, and
   releases. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks
   and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ
   materially. These risks include acceptance of Vizario software by
   developers and users, the successful development of competitive
   software to Vizario's, competitive pricing pressures for software
   and services, and the availability of financing to complete
   management's plans and objectives. In addition, other risks are
   detailed in Vizario periodic reports, Form 8-K of Vizario, filed
   on 5 June, 2001, and Rule 14F-1 Information Statement of Gallagher
   Research Corporation filed on May 10, 2001. These forward-looking
   statements speak only as of the date hereof. Vizario disclaims any
   intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements.

          FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
          July 27, 2001
                WINK PROSPECT DEVONIAN PRODUCTION TESTING
          Touchstone Resources USA, Inc. is pleased to
          announce that the Wink prospect, Morton/Halley
          23/24 which is located in Winkler County, Texas,
          is currently being evaluated by open-hole testing in
          the Devonian formation at approximately 14,000 feet.
          The Morton/Halley 23/24 was drilled to a total
          depth of 17,636 feet. After evaluating the deeper
          Ellenburger formation, the Company has commenced a
          plug-back operation to the Devonian. The Devonian
          was open-hole drilled drill-stem tested by
          Schlumberger at a calculated rate of 2,400 barrels
          of oil per a day (?BOPD?). A production facility has
          already been installed at this location and
          production is scheduled to start on August 1, 2001.
          Wes Franklin, Executive Vice President for
          Touchstone Resources, states ?The Company is very
          excited with this discovery in the Devonian. This is
          a very significant ?high impact? discovery, which
          enhances the real value of our development in the
          Wink prospect. The size of this discovery could be
          quite large by today?s on-shore U.S. standards. We
          anticipate continued success in other wells in this
          region.? Mr. Franklin further states, ?The Morton 23
           is drilling over 10,000 feet on its way to a
          proposed total depth of 15,000 feet. The well is a
          Devonian delineation/development well down-dipped
          from the Morton/Halley 23/24  and will provide an
          indication of the size of the Devonian reservoir.?
          The Company is also pleased to announce that an
          additional field discovery has been made at the Wink
          project. The Morton 11  was deepened to 11,000
          feet and is currently testing the Devonian chert at
          approximately 10,700 feet. Mr. Franklin added, ?the
          Devonian here is in a separate fault block 2 miles
          north of the Morton/Halley 23/24  which is
          testing the same formation 3,000 feet deeper. The
          Morton 11  well has tested at a daily rate of 1.2
          million cubic feet of gas per day (?MMCFGPD?) and 4
          BOPD. Following bottom hole pressure testing, the
          well will be placed on production immediately.?

   Today, in our continued effort to bring you breaking after market
   news we have chosen to feature a company whose business model
   revolves around corporate risk management. Secretary of Labor
   Elaine L. Chao recently stated "Every day 16 workers still lose
   their lives in this country. And every hour 650 workers experience
   an injury or illness on the job. While these numbers are steadily
   coming down, they are still far too high." OSHA compliance and
   workplace safety is just one of the areas of Risk Management in
   which LearnCom engages. Read on!
   Breaking News                                              [Image]
   LearnCom, Inc.'s (otcbb: LRCM) four Business Units provide

   and OSHA-required training. LearnCom's resources are provided in a

   LearnCom (otcbb: LRCM) issued a press release. Obviously, due to
   the late release the market as yet has not been able to react. The
   release has been excerpted below. Click here for the entire
   relase: LRCM BREAKING NEWS
                LearnCom Recaps its Strategy and Results
              CEO Provides Recap of Strategy and Progress.
   LearnCom CEO Lloyd Singer stated, ``Our goal is to become the
   major supplier of soft skills training resources and related
   services in the highly fractionated $60 billion training
   industry.
   The (company's) first acquisition in January, 1999 included the
   high quality video assets (several hundred titles) of WingsNet,
   Inc. and provided the foundation to get the business started. By
   midyear, '99 we were cash neutral on just $750,000 in sales and
   provided our backers with the confidence to fund further growth.
   In August, 1999, we acquired the stock of BNA Communications, a 50
   year producer/distributor of high quality video courseware
   specializing in harassment prevention, diversity and employment
   law. The company had been a subsidiary of The Bureau of National
   Affairs, the large Washington, D.C. publisher and information
   provider to the legal and HR professions.
   In January, 2001, we acquired the stock of venerable distributor,
   VideoLearning Systems, Inc. (VLS). This deal provided an
   additional eight salespeople, and three excellent managers.
   Integration is proceeding on schedule. VLS is on track to generate
   $2.5 million in revenue in 2001.

   an instrument with which allergies and food and chemical
   sensitivities may be detected without invading the body. Another
   application, the Bio-Potential Instrument, allows chiropractors
   the means with which to gauge the benefit of chiropractic care.
   The merger with PTS Inc. today brings yet another unique body of

                ELAST Technologies Merges with PTS, Inc.
   LAS VEGAS-- ELAST Technologies, Inc. ( OTCBB: ELTI ) announced it
   has merged with PTS, Inc., a Nevada corporation organized in 1999.
   PTS is committed to the development of a truly global trading
   platform to facilitate everyday business transactions. Through its
   pending joint venture with a major Shanghai information technology
   firm and the venture's forthcoming launch of a China based
   business-to-business platform PTS will take a major step towards
   this goal. PTS' China platform will permit real time business
   transactions such as electronic payments, contract fulfillment and
   the dissemination of financial information in China. Upon China's
   accession to the World Trade Organization PTS will be uniquely
   positioned to expand its platform globally conducting transactions
   of any size, anywhere, across multiple currencies.
   Through this merger ELAST Technologies will be favorably
   positioned in two important and emerging fields, electronic
   payment and electronic medicine, and the potential presented by
   each is limitless. Moreover, ``ELAST's merger with PTS should
   assure early perfection and delivery of ELAST's diagnostic tools,
   as well as reduced engineering and production costs,'' predicts
   Thomas F. Krucker, President and CEO.
   Currently, ELAST is engaged in the development of two separate
   diagnostic tools: its allergy testing device and its chiropractic
   outcome-measuring instrument. These instruments stem from the
   Company's identification of commercial applications for worldwide
   patents secured by its founder, Robert D. Milne, MD. A primary
   application is the innovative Electronic Allergo Sensitivity Test
   or the ELAST Device(TM). The ELAST Device(TM) is a non-invasive
   medical tool that is being designed to accurately diagnose
   allergies, as well as food and chemical sensitivities. ELAST
   Technologies holds the patents, trademarks and legal rights to
   manufacture, sell and lease its electronic allergy-testing device
   and is making great strides in refining the prototype.
   A second application of ELAST's technologies is ELAST's
   Bio-Potential Instrument. The Bio-Potential Instrument can provide
   doctors of chiropractic with the means to measure the damage of
   vertebral subluxations, as well as the normalizing effect of
   chiropractic adjustments. ELAST plans initial delivery of its
   Bio-Potential Instrument shortly.

  Issue 8                                                June 20, 2001
   Editor's Note                                              [Image]
   Today, StockNight brings to you a substantial press release from a
   company with a business plan a little different from those we
   normally feature. The release, issued close to the end of trading
   today, announces the listing of The Neptune Society on the OTC
   bulletin board. The company had been trading on the Pink Sheets in
   the $5 range before this long awaited announcement.
   The Neptune Society (otcbb: NTUN).                         [Image]
   Headquartered in Burbank, CA., The Neptune Society Inc. is one of
   North America's largest cremation specialists, and is the only
   publicly traded company dealing solely in cremation services. The
   Neptune Society, operating for nearly three decades with locations
   in California, Florida, New York, Washington, Iowa, Oregon and
   Arizona has provided thousands of cremation services and currently
   has close to 60,000 active contracts and nearly $40 million in
   trust in its unique Pre-Need program. The Neptune Society's goal
   is to provide a simple, dignified and economic alternative to the
   traditional funeral burial service system.

              The Neptune Society Receives Approval on Its
                               Form 211.
              Company Now Listed on the OTC Bulletin Board.
   BURBANK, Calif., June 20 -- The Neptune Society (OTC Bulletin
   Board: NTUN), one of the country's largest publicly traded
   cremation specialists, announced today that the Form 211 that has
   been filed by Herzog Heine Geduld, a Merrill Lynch Company, has
   been approved and The Neptune Society has returned to trading on
   the National Association Securities Dealers Over-The-Counter
   Bulletin Board.
   The Neptune Society Inc. is one of North America's largest
   cremation specialists, and is the only publicly traded company
   with a business strategy that focuses solely on providing
   cremation services. The Company believes its competitive strategy
   coupled with a selective acquisition and expansion program will
   enable the Company to establish itself as a leader in the
   cremation service industry and maximize shareholder value.
   Neptune's plan is to become the largest and most trusted name in
   the cremation service industry. During the last 12 months, the
   Company completed three strategic acquisition/mergers in
   Washington, Oregon and Iowa and opened one new office in the
   Seattle, Washington area, resulting in a market presence serving
   approximately five million people in Washington, Oregon and Iowa.
   As a result of these acquisitions, the Neptune Society now has a
   market presence in seven different states, including California,
   Florida and New York. The Neptune Society is currently planning
   two additional ``start-up'' locations, which are anticipated to be
   opened this year. The targeted market areas have a total
   population in excess of another two and one half million people.
   In addition, the Company is examining four new states as possible
   locations for ``start-up'' locations during 2002. The Company
   believes that continued growth and development of The Neptune
   Society brand name will assist the Company in achieving its goal
   of becoming the largest provider of cremation services in the
   United States.
   An added benefit to the Portland, Oregon transaction is that The
   Apogee Companies, Inc. has become a major shareholder in the
   Neptune Society. Roy P. Disney (of the Disney family), and
   Apogee's Chairman said, ``We will miss having CMC as one of our
   Apogee Companies, but we are looking forward to becoming part of a
   much bigger effort with our new friends down the street at
   Neptune.''
   Marco Markin, President and CEO of the Neptune Society, said, ``I
   am happy that the Neptune Society is now a full reporting company
   with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and more importantly
   with the growth that Neptune has achieved over the last 18 months.
   Market share in Washington, Oregon and Iowa has surpassed our
   expectations and we foresee continued growth in these states.''

             Touchstone Announces Ligonbach Simpson Interval
          HOUSTON, June 21 /PRNewswire/ -- Touchstone Resources
          USA, Inc. (CDNX: TUT.V ) announces that the Ligon
          State 22  sidetrack has completed a open hole drill
          stem test of the middle Simpson formation over an
          interval from 14,920 feet to 15,250 feet. Fractured
          limestone was tested at a rate of 5.5 MMCFPD during a
          1 hour flow period. The well is being drilled to a
          proposed depth of 18,500 feet to test the Ellenburger
          formation. The original well reached a depth of
          16,640 feet, but failed to reach its objective
          because of thrust faulting.
          An Atoka zone above 12,000 feet had strong mud-log
          shows and may be behind pipe pay.
          The operator encountered a number of Delaware sands
          in the original hole from approximately 5,000-7,000
          feet. Several of these intervals were cored and are
          considered potential pay sands. Subsequently, the
          Ligon State 22  located to the east of the  was
          drilled to a depth of 6,830 feet and completion
          efforts have commended on the lowermost interval.
          The Ligonbach Prospect, in the Waha/Lockridge
          Project, is located in Reeves County, Texas.

          The Research Works, Inc, the publishing division of
          stocksontheweb.com, publishes reports on companies
          they feel have strong sales and earnings prospects,
          proprietary assets, and capitalizations that are low
          relative to their earnings potential. They recently
          ran a report on Touchstone Resources:
          Use of Advanced Seismic Technologies to Maximize the
           Success Rate for Discovery of High-Impact  Oil and
                              Gas Prospects
          Touchstone Resources Ltd. (the "Company") is engaged
          in the exploration and development of oil and gas
          prospects in East and West Texas and southern
          Louisiana. Its strategy is to grow its oil and gas
          production and reserves rapidly by (1) partnering
          with larger independent oil companies in particularly
          promising projects and (2) developing its own
          properties based on its proprietary 3-D seismic data
          sets and its well regarded in-house expertise in
          analyzing 3-Dseismic data.
          Among the Company's key proprietary assets are an
          extensive library of 3-D seismic data and in-house
          technical capability to work the data. The library
          consists of nearly 1,000 square miles of data in East
          Texas and approximately 250 square miles in West
          Texas. The technical people working the data have
          developed proprietary algorithms to assist them in
          data interpretation.
          The Company has a half dozen major oil and gas
          projects underway. There are six rigs drilling,
          including three for deep drilling; six wells testing
          and completing; and seven wells producing. Management
          has a knowledge base relating to deep gas reserves
          that is unusual for a company of this size. Early
          results from drilling activity are very encouraging,
          and there could be six to seven new production wells
          per month through year-end. The Company is hopeful
          that its projects will have some very sizable
          discoveries in the near term.
          Significant oil and gas production is expected to
          begin early this summer and build rapidly over the
          following several years. Management recognizes the
          value of maintaining low corporate overhead, and it
          outsources many functions in an attempt to minimize
          overhead expenditures. Estimates for 2002 show
          potential production of 9.16 BCFE and potential cash
          flows of $34.4 million.
          Estimates of the reserves and economics of the major
          projects show that the present value of the cash
          flows (discounted at 10%) is $366 million. This
          compares with an equity market capitalization for the
          Company of only $41 million.

   Once again, StockNight has been presented with the opportunity to
   provide to our members a press release issued AFTER market,
   meaning that unlike the majority of corporate news the average
   investor normally hears about LAST, this information has not yet
   been acted on by the investing community. Whenever possible, we
   strongly encourage companies to put the news we feature out after
   the bell to level the playing field and give OUR subscribers a
   chance to react FIRST.
   Like the rest of you, we have been barraged with news about the
   "Energy Crisis" and the urgent measures being discussed to remedy
   the problem. To gauge the magnitude of this issue in the media
   simply look at the coverage CNN is giving it.    As you read further in today's StockNight  you'll also find that
   the issue is now quite global.
   Today's breaking news comes from  a company whose business is in
   the heart of this electric issue. TechLite (OTCBB: THLT) can help
   clients take their first step towards  energy conservation. They
   provide state-of-the-art energy efficient lighting retrofit
   components which can provide more and better lighting while
   reducing energy costs (the power bill) by 50% or more. We strongly
   suggest that you read the following and keep THLT on your watch
   list.

   THLT BREAKING NEWS
   Tuesday's News
   TechLite Announces International Expansion. Brazil office to Open.
   J.D. Arvidson, President of TechLite, Inc. announced that TechLite
   is in the process of opening a TechLite branch in Sao Paulo,
   Brazil.
   Arvidson points out that Brazil, which is currently beginning six
   months of obligatory electricity rationing, is faced with an
   energy crisis that is rapidly getting worse and threatens to
   cripple Latin America's largest economy. This obligatory
   electricity rationing is in response to what increasingly
   resembles a California-style energy crisis.
   Three quarters of the 170 million Brazilians have been told that
   they must immediately cut consumption by 20% or face rolling
   black-outs and unscheduled power interruptions. Few Brazilians had
   any inkling of the seriousness of the crisis until the government
   announced the conservation measures in mid-May, sparing only the
   Amazon districts and the far South. As the harsh reality of the
   situation sinks in, the initial shock and anger are giving way to
   a grim realization that nearly every aspect of life will be
   curtailed.

   Despite the loud clamor of earnings warnings, stocks were up
   across the board today as investors and analysts wondered if a
   bottom had been reached. The Dow Jones industrial average closed
   up 138.38 to 10,729.60; the Nasdaq composite rose 19.47 to
   2,223.90 and the Standard & Poor's 500 ended up 8.09 to 1,261.89.
   It was a strange day for the markets as investors shrugged off bad
   news and bought in a manner eerliy similar to recent months where
   good news was  ignored and sold into. The Nasdaq is now up 5
   percent since last Friday, withstanding a number of large
   technology companies warning about poor earnings.

   We held the publishing of this newsletter until later than
   expected as we know that an enormous amount of our database are
   Yahoo users and investors and the stock, as most of you know, was
   halted around 10:00 a.m est. pending a company announcement.
   Just a few moments ago The Financial Times announced that Yahoo
   CEO Tim Koogle will step down and warn of lackluster quarterly
   earnings. Yahoo confirmed this report atfter the market's close,
   making for what will undoubtedly be an interesting Thursday
   morning for the stock. Today, the stock traded off $1.44 before it
   was halted.
   Conversely, Quintek (OTCBB: QTEK) announced 2nd Quarter financial
   results with a revenue increase of 57% and a profit increase of
   100%. Quintek also announced their client roster in the release
   which includes Imation,  TRW, Lockheed-Martin, U.S. Navy, Boeing,
   and a multitude of others also noted in the release.

   The NASDAQ stumbled to a 27 month low Friday, driven in party by a
   nasty earnings warning by chip maker Intel. The Nasdaq composite
   index dropped 115.88, or just over 5 percent, to  2,052.85 during
   Friday's session, it's lowest level since Dec. 17, 1998. The DOW
   was battered too, falling 213.63, or almost 2 percent, to
   10,644.62 managing somehow to stay up 1.7 percent for the week.
   CNNfn stated in an article published Friday, that  "analysts said
   investors do not need to run for the hills in a panic." despite
   the bloodbath in the tech sector quoting Seth Martin, an analyst
   with IDEAglobal.com as saying, "I think stocks really are near
   their lows at this point and I think investors are
   bargain-oriented right now. They believe in some sort of comeback
   by the end of this year so if you believe in that, you have to
   like stocks at these prices."
   We'll see on Monday as earnings statements continue to be
   released.

   At StockNight we prefer to publish news in our Breaking News
   section that truly is "Hot off the Press." When at all possible we
   try and work with news that has been released after the marker's
   close or late in the trading day.
   Today, at roughly 22 minutes after Friday's market close
   Saf-T-Hammer (otcbb: SAFH) issued a statement that many of our
   readers will undoubtedly find interesting given the tragic school
   shooting of this week.
   Here is part of the release:
         Saf-T-Hammer Responds to Child Safety Lock Legislation
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.--March 9, 2001--Saf-T-Hammer Corp. (OTCBB: SAFH
   - news), the Scottsdale-based firearm safety and security company
   today responded to the efforts of Wisconsin U.S. Sen. Herb Kohl's
   March 1 reintroduction of the Child Safety Lock legislation he
   authored.
   Sen. Kohl has also authored the Youth Handgun Safety Act of 1994
   and the Gun-Free School Zone Act, which makes it a federal crime
   to knowingly bring a gun within 1,000 feet of a school or to fire
   a gun in these zones.
   ``We are watching this legislation closely,'' said Robert Scott,
   president of Saf-T-Hammer. ``There is a continuing, growing
   awareness of the need for firearm safety solutions. The recent
   school shooting in San Diego tragically brought the issue to the
   nation's attention again.''
   The ``Child Safety Lock Act of 2001'' reintroduced into the Senate
   last week under Senate Bill S 436, calls for safer keeping of
   firearms including the requirement of child handgun safety locks
   included in every sale and transfer of a handgun.
   ``All firearm owners, most of whom act extremely responsibly, have
   an obligation to store and secure their firearms in a manner to
   prevent unauthorized access,'' said Scott. ``The gun safety locks
   manufactured by our company have proven to be effective,
   inexpensive and easy to use.''
   The bill would be an amendment to chapter 44 of title 18, U.S.
   Code and is co-sponsored by Sen. Barbara Boxer, Sen. Jon Corzine,
   Sen. John F. Kerry, Sen. Charles E. Schumer, Sen. Lincoln D.
   Chafee, Sen. Richard J. Durbin and Sen. Jack Reed.
   Polls show that between 75 and 80 percent of the American public,
   including gun owners, favor the mandatory sale of child safety
   locks with guns. In addition, according to public reports from
   last year's campaign, President Bush indicated he supports the
   idea of mandatory child safety locks and would sign a bill that
   required the sale of a child safety lock with all new handguns.
   Attorney General Ashcroft confirmed the Bush administration
   supports the mandatory sale of child safety locks during his
   Senate confirmation hearings earlier this year. Each year,
   teenagers and children are involved in more than 10,000 accidental
   shootings in which close to 800 people die. In addition, every
   year 1,300 children usefirearms to commit suicide. ``The need is
   definite and real,'' said Scott.

                the licensed rights to
         The Swamp Critters of Lost LagoonÂ.
        The key creator behind Animazing Entertainment is
        singer/songwriter/director Bobby Goldsboro. Mr.
        Goldsboro originated "The Swamp Critters of Lost
        LagoonÂ" characters and musical TV series out of a
        search for wholesome, values-based children's
        entertainment. Imark has produced a total of 52 Â½ hours
        of episodes, which air five times a week on the
        Inspirational Network reaching 30 million television
        households. A further 3.5 million households are
        reached as the series airs in both English and in
        Spanish on the Sky Angel Satellite Broadcasting
        Network.
        The show quickly gained a distinctive broad identity
        both because of its content and Mr. Goldboro's
        distinctive musical talents as song composer as well as
        writer and director for the series. The show was also
        awarded the Seal of Approval from the prestigious Dove
        Foundation, which identifies and promotes quality
        programming suitable for family viewing and was also
        awarded The Parents Choice Gold Seal for quality family
        content.
        Animazing Entertainment has also signed a licensing
        agreement with Jazzland Inc., a national-level,
        140-acre destination theme park developed by theme park
        giant Ogden Entertainment Inc. Jazzland opened in New
        Orleans on May 18, 2000. The Jazzland deal will build
        on the Swamp Critters brand recognition, as the
        characters will be interactive with the expected 1.8
        million park visitors per year.

          While we generally bring you profiles of undiscovered
          stocks, we also want to provide follow up on
          companies we have profiled in the past.
          VirtualSellers.com Inc. (OTCBB: VDOT) is one such
          company.  VDOT issued some very interesting news
          today about the release of a new version (v5) of its
          TAME(tm) software.
          The release states that TAME V is an alternative to
          the popular Java programming language and that it
          saves significant programming time -- which equates
          to direct cost savings to Web developers, network
          programmers and software developers.  This is a
          powerful, yet simple-to-use programming tool that
          automates and streamlines some very complicated
          tasks.

          FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
          VIRTUALSELLERS.COM RELEASES AN ALTERNATIVE TO JAVA
              -VirtualsellersÂ Releases Version Five Of Its
               Proprietary TAMEÂ Pure Scripting Language -
          CHICAGO, Ill., March 21, 2001 Â VirtualSellers.com,
          Inc. (OTC BB: VDOT), a developer and provider of
          software and technology used to automate and
          streamline Web and e-commerce applications, announced
          today that it has completed development of version
          five of its TAME software.  ÂTAME VÂ is now available
          for Internet Service Providers (ISPs), Web developers
          and networking programmers.
          The new version of TAMEÂ, is a faster, easier, and
          more powerful version than its predecessors. This
          high performance, platform independent, server-side
          programming package is used to produce Web pages,
          Web-based applications, and e-commerce applications.
          It serves as the ÂglueÂ between many Web-based
          platforms, languages and legacy systems including XML
          and XSL applications, and in the future, MicrosoftÂs
          .NET.
          As a leader in platform independence, TAME V can be
          deployed on Linux, UNIX, or Windows NT. Its distinct
          advantage lies in reducing the complexity of
          accessing application programming interfaces (APIs),
          ODBC and most other files systems.  ÂTAME is the most
          productive Web development tool on the market,Â said
          Dennis Sinclair, PhD., president and CEO of
          VirtualSellers. ÂTAMEÂs simplified language and the
          ability to use previously developed code makes
          transition seamless and requires minimal training.Â
          TAME V simplifies how systems and software work
          together and requires 25 percent less code than Java
          Script.  The smaller code package reduces the amount
          of space required for files to move through a
          network, reducing bandwidth usage.  Programming in
          TAME is consistent, requiring less programming time
          and a lower level programming skill set resulting in
          lower labor rates.
          Its interfaces can eliminate bugs, errors, and other
          programming flaws. At the core of the system is a
          concise, proprietary engine that provides the
          language interpreter and basic functionality. ÂThat
          means less overhead and a smaller memory footprint,Â
          said Sinclair. ÂTAME only employs what is required in
          an application, instead of redundant and unnecessary
          tools. The result is an efficient, but flexible
          software that makes loading easy, development fast
          and cost savings routine.Â
          With these new enhancements on TAME V, lesser-skilled
          programmers can produce results immediately. If a
          unique or complex problem arises, an average C
          programmer can be brought in to identify and solve
          the problem. The solution can then be given to the
          script coders for manipulation.  TAME software also
          provides additional core functionality that is easily
          inserted into the language, allowing script
          programmers to tackle the application scripting and
          continue with the creative process to make the
          application attractive to the end user.
          The Installation of TAME is very simple, utilizing
          fully automated standard installation software that
          is familiar to most Web-servers allowing for quick
          installation and configuration of the product. Once
          installed, no further action is required, except,
          perhaps, when adding any optional application
          modules.
          TAME is based on objects and is extensible, so new
          objects or functions may be created in C or C++ and
          will result as an extension of the Web-server as
          dynamic libraries. This gives the TAME software
          unlimited flexibility and control. For the most part,
          the developers may replace or add objects, file
          routines, database access, or any other functions as
          they see fit, thus avoiding interface problems that
          invariably arise with other less flexible scripting
          languages. And any code developed as business rules,
          are now reusable among many applications, providing a
          greater and quicker return on investment.
          TAME has the ability to converse with multiple
          databases on any platform, using ODBC connectivity.
          This eliminates the need for custom connections with
          custom software specific to those connections. And
          moving to another platform becomes a non-issue.
          The new features of TAME V include:
          Â· Universal concepts found on APL, C++, Java and
          other scripting languages.
          Â· ÂFlextypeÂ Variables that are non-declarative, yet
          strongly typed.
          Â· Syntax checking.
          Â· Generalized arrays (arrays of arrays) have been
          implemented.
          Â· Session management allows for persistence of
          objects, variables, and page connections.
          Â· A configuration file allows for multiple instance
          control of applications.
          Â· A configuration file allows for specific control of
          loading only the required object modules.
          Â· Script library files that are loaded and parsed
          only once.
          Â· Script library files that reside in memory for
          faster access.
          Â· Support for XML and XSL for processing data and
          connectivity to other XML systems.

                               ***
          News/Assignment Editors & Sports Writers
IRVINE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 2, 2001--Grand Prix Sports Inc.
(OTC BB:GPRX) announced that it has won both the FIA Formula 3000
International Team Championship and Drivers' Championship for the
2001 season. Coca-Cola Nordic Racing secured the Team Championship
with two races remaining in the 2001 season and has set new team
records for the most podium appearances and team points of any team
since 1985. Appropriately, Coca-Cola Europe Ltd. has extended its
title sponsorship for Nordic Racing for an additional two years.
Coca-Cola Nordic Racing driver Justin Wilson also won the prestigious
Drivers' Championship while teammate Tomas Enge finished in a tie
for second place. Wilson became the first-ever British driver to win
the Drivers' Title and with a 71 point total, eclipsed the all time
single season points record previously held by Formula 1 driver Juan
Pablo Montoya. Enge missed the last F3000 race at Monza, Italy after
being chosen by the Prost Formula 1 team to replace the injured
Luciano Burti for the last three Formula 1 races. Enge successfully
competed in the Italian, American and Japanese Grand Prixes to
finish the Formula 1 season with Prost.
"Obviously, this is the utmost achievement in Formula 3000," stated
Team Principal, Derek Mower. "To win both of these titles is a
testament to the strength of our race team and the support of
sponsors like Coca-Cola and Conoco. Together, we're effectively
tapping into the enormous popularity of global motor sports."
Grand Prix Sports owns 40% of Coca-Cola Nordic Racing and is the
first publicly traded race team in the Formula world, allowing
fans of Formula racing, by and large the world's most popular sport,
the unique opportunity to "own" part of a race team.

           In the light of the U.S. reliance on foreign oil in
                          this troubled world,
          domestic oil refineries are constantly strengthening
                            their reserves
          in accord with the energy policy of President Bush
          As one analyst said, "No more being held as a hostage
                               for oil."

        Friday November 9, 7:33 pm Eastern Time
        SOURCE: Gulftex Energy Corporation
            Global Oil Supply Uncertainty Raises Interest in
         American Oil Producers; Gulftex Oil Ready to Assist in
                             Meeting Demand
        HOUSTON, Nov. 9 /PRNewswire/ -- Tensions in the oil
        rich Middle East have renewed interest in American oil
        reserves and domestic producers such as Gulftex Energy
        Corporation (OTC Bulletin Board: GTXE - news).
        In an ABC News report October 22, 2001, the network
        quoted Merrill Lynch analyst Steven Pfiefer as stating,
        ``It is quite feasible that we could see prices rise if
        conditions overseas escalate in some form,'' adding
        that Pfeifer and several other analysts are predicting
        higher oil prices similar to what the U.S. experienced
        during the 1970s when restrained production from OPEC
        and military and political volatility in the Middle
        East led to skyrocketing oil prices and fuel costs.
        Heightening fears of a diminished oil supply are U.S.
        Government suggestions that the ``War on Terrorism''
        could extend to other nations beyond Afghanistan, some
        of which may be OPEC nations or allies of OPEC
        countries. The effect of such action could ``abruptly
        change'' the output from OPEC according to the ABC
        report. OPEC meets again in Vienna on November 14,
        2001.
        Moreover, ABC states that U.S. ally Saudi Arabia
        produces more than double the oil production of the
        rest of the world combined and as a potential target of
        exiled Saudi Osama Bin Laden, a ``nightmare scenario''
        would be a successful attack on that oil supply or its
        distributing ports.
        Amid these fears, interest has risen in domestic oil
        suppliers such as Gulftex Energy Corporation, a Houston
        based integrated petroleum company involved in
        exploration and production, transportation, refining,
        and retail marketing. The company develops and manages
        oil and gas fields, focusing on the Permian Basin in
        New Mexico and Texas, onshore United States Gulf Coast,
        and the Gulf of Mexico, offshore in Indonesia, Nigeria
        and Qatar. The Company is also involved in pipeline
        transportation, oil & refined products trading, and
        shipping.
        The ABC report also states that an alternative to
        Middle Eastern oil dependence is to develop existing
        oil resources within the United States. The U.S. Energy
        Department is expected to unveil a report soon
        outlining the benefits of developing and expanding
        domestic oil reserves, including bumping up the
        strategic reserve, again, according to the report.
        Earlier this year amid threats of rolling blackouts,
        President Bush and U.S. Dept. of Energy's Spencer
        Abraham repeatedly called for increased domestic
        drilling.
        ``We're looking forward to an increase in incentives
        for domestic oil exploration and production,'' said
        Marc Duchesne, president of Gulftex Energy Corporation.
        ``We will be making some dramatic announcements in the
        very near future regarding the acquisition of large oil
        and gas properties in the United States. Stay tuned.''
        Gulftex Energy Corporation is an integrated petroleum
        company involved in exploration and production,
        transportation, refining, and retail marketing. The
        Company develops and manages oil and gas fields,
        focusing on New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, Kentucky plus
        onshore United States Gulf Coast and the Gulf of
        Mexico, including offshore. The Company is also
        involved in pipeline transportation, oil & refined

        Here at StockUpTicks we try to be very selective
        regarding the companies that we expose to our
        membership. Since we're not a "pump", "tout", or
        "hype" service and don't render opinion about our
        featured companies, we'll never pressure you to buy or
        sell these stocks.  However, we are very proud of the
        performance of our featured companies.  Before you read
        about BioSecure, today's featured company, take a look
        at how each of the companies we've featured over the
        last couple of months have performed.
         All percentages below are based on today's close (Nov.
                                16, 2001)

          Remember, these aren't necessarily the highest prices
            since our mailings.  Rather, these are the actual
           percentages based on today's prices compared to the
                   trading day BEFORE we published.
           In some cases the stocks have actually traded much
                                 higher.

          Today's Featured Company is BioSecure (OTCBB: YCCI)
               (Presently Known As Yes Clothing Co.  Inc)
          As company's inevitably succeed or fail in the
          publicly traded arena, their listings are often
          acquired by new companies in what is known as a
          reverse merger. In this instance, BioSecure has
          acquired the "shell" of Yes Clothing Co. for its own
          purposes.  Obviously, Yes Clothing Co. is no longer
          an active part of this publicly traded vehicle and
          the stock symbol (YCCI) is now reflective of the
          business plan of BioSecure Corporation.

          Effective personal protection is essential to any
          person who may be exposed to potentially hazardous
          substances. Since the Sepember 11th attacks changed
          our lives forever, many believe that situations may
          arise when people at home or work may be exposed to
          bio-hazards. BioSecure will develop, license,
          purchase, and market bio-technical products to
          consumers and businesses to assist in preventing or
          minimalizing any exposure to harmful biological or
          chemical agents.

          In the tradition of Stocknight and Stockupticks, we
          have asked BioSecure to publish its press release

                               Approves
                     Name Change to BioSecure Corp.
             Company to Develop, License and Market Personal
                     Bio-Hazard Protection Products
          NEWPORT BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 16,
          2001--Yes Clothing Company Inc. (OTCBB:YCCI - news)
          today announced that the company's board of directors
          has approved the company's name change from Yes
          Clothing Company Inc. to BioSecure Corp.
          The company intends to identify and develop, license,
          purchase and market bio-technical and other personal
          protection products under the name BioSecure Corp.
          The name change resolution adopted by the board will
          be submitted to the Securities and Exchange
          Commission and
          shareholders in accordance with the current proxy
          rules, within the next few weeks.
          All shareholders of record will receive instructions
          on where to send their existing certificates in
          exchange for new certificates.  Subject to approval,
          the company will effect its name change, a
          corresponding change of CUSIP number and a change in
          the trading symbol within the next 60 days.
          ``The name change will effectively separate the
          company's historical business from its future
          activities,'' said Jon Lawver, corporate secretary
          and director of Yes Clothing. ``The board is
          enthusiastic about entering this market at a time
          when the world is on heightened alert and there is an
          obvious need for personal protection products.
          ``The BioSecure name will better represent the
          personal protection products the company will be
          developing and marketing.  The recent bio-terrorism
          events have made it clear that hazardous materials
          are now part of our daily lives and BioSecure
          products will be introduced to address everything
          from anthrax to the more mundane bio-hazards that
          exist in every business and residence, like copier
          toner and cleaning products.''

  This publication is brought to you by the publishers of
StockUpTicks.com and StockNight.com. This new   "Rapid Blast" service provides all the same great content you are used
to, in a text format that allows us to reach you in just minutes - thus
maximizing your ability to read, digest, and react. This week's profile   highlights TRSG Corp. (OTC BB: TSGO). The company has BREAKING NEWS
that is important to all investors during this time of bio-terrorism and
America's first war of the new century.

  The recent anthrax scares have led to a handful of companies being
discovered that have products   available that test and disinfect antimicrobial agents. Vital Living
Products (OTC BB: VLPI) recently   announced it had developed home testing kits for Anthrax and the stock
soared to a 52-week high on   Monday with shares climbing from $0.06 to $2.00. Another company,
Veridien (OTC BB: VRDE)   announced that its sanitizing and disinfecting products are designed
to stop or slow and control   environmental challenges and the stock jumped from $0.05 to $0.13.
Other companies like   eSAFETYWORLD, Cepheid, Vital Living, and Ozolutions, and InVision
Technologies have emerged and   shareholders have been rewarded in this era of fears for personal
safety. Some are calling it the "Anthrax   Bubble."
     WHAT COMPANY WILL BE NEXT IN CONFRONTING BIOLOGICAL THREATS ?
  Who will be the next leader in eradicating bacteria and preventing
biological risks? There is a great deal of investment speculation.
  TRSG Corp. is a leader in selling neutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals,
and health and dietary supplements in   the U.S. and Japan.  The following is an excerpt from a BusinessWire
news release issued today:
        ------  Handheld Anthrax Detection Device -- $50-$100 Price Tag
  *** TRSG ANNOUNCES NEW PRODUCT LINE ***
  LAS VEGAS--Oct. 25, 2001--TRSG Corp. (OTC BB: TSGO), a majority-owned
subsidiary of   Gateway Distributors Ltd., Thursday announced it has entered into a
preliminary agreement to acquire   certain assets of Mobility Solutions Inc.  These assets include the
Rest Assured Product Line of hand-held,   low-cost devices used to detect the presence of biological agents such
as Bacillus Anthraci (commonly   referred to as Anthrax) as well as many other biological agents.
  The Rest Assured Biological Agent Detection Product line utilizes UV-A
waves or waves in the 320 to   380 nm range, commonly referred to as black light or wood's light,
that have been determined to not cause   sunburn to human skin though the use of eye protection is recommended
during use. These products are   for detection purposes only and are not intended as a treatment or
cure for any specific disease.
  Ongoing research is being conducted at this time to verify the
product's effectiveness in the use of   identifying the presence of a wide range of biological agents such as
Becillus Anthraci, which is currently   making headlines throughout the world. Independent research
laboratories are conducting this research.
  Additional information regarding these studies can be found on the

        In the Spring of this year, Stockupticks brought you
        the story of a small-cap company that produced firearm
        safety and security products. That company,
        Saf-T-Hammer (OTC BB: SAFH) later acquired legendary
        gun manufacturer Smith & Wesson. One of the products in
        development at that time was a gun made from a new,
        lightweight, exotic-metal alloy making the gun easier
        to carry and conceal. Due to interest in using this
        weapon for arming flight crews on commercial airliners,
        the dealer response has been tremendous.

          By WILLIAM FREEBAIRN
          A new line of ultra-light revolvers in stores this
          month is proving a success for Smith & Wesson, which
          can't keep up with demand. The new guns are among the
          first in the world to use scandium, a metal that has
          been used in Russian fighter jets and baseball bats.
          They are being marketed under the AirLite Sc label
          and all are capable of firing a powerful .357-caliber
          Magnum round that had been previously unavailable in
          such a lightweight gun.
          The smaller revolvers, which weight just over 11
          ounces, have been shipping for several weeks; larger
          guns should reach dealers in the coming days.
          "It's a hot item," said Herb A. Belin, handgun
          product manager for Smith & Wesson. "Our constraint
          is our production rate." The guns are more expensive
          than stainless-steel revolvers. New guns carry a
          suggested price of between $700 and $800 each.
          The lighter guns are likely to be purchased by people
          who want them for personal defense, especially those
          with permits to carry concealed weapons, Belin said.
          Officials said developing the guns using the new
          metal took longer than expected and taught them some
          lessons in metallurgy. In high-speed video footage of
          the gun firing, the frame and barrel moved
          dramatically due to the scandium alloy's flexibility.
          "That gun does the rumba," Belin said.
          Designers increased the size of some parts of the gun
          to reduce flexing. Titanium was used in the cylinder
          for strength, but testing showed it was also needed
          in the center pin and other parts of the weapon.
          Steel is used for the hammer and trigger. "This
          taught us to make even stronger, tougher guns," Belin
          said.
          Scandium is a little-known metal that occupies a
          place on the periodic table immediately before
          titanium. Discovered in the late 1800s, it found use
          in the former Soviet Union, which had a virtual
          monopoly on the supply from the Ukraine. The Soviets
          used it in fighter jets and missile parts. When the
          Soviet Union broke up, the metal began to see more
          widespread use, for example in aluminum baseball bats
          and mountain bike frames.
          Although scandium costs about $7,000 a pound, the
          amount needed to mix with aluminum and other alloying
          agents is small. Adding a little scandium to aluminum
          strengthens the material more than twofold, Belin
          said.
          Its weight will increase the number of people willing
          to carry it, Belin said. "You don't need a holster.
          You can carry it in your pocket."
          The lightest of the scandium guns is less than half
          of the weight of the lightest .357-caliber Magnum the
          company made before. Because of their light weight
          and flexible scandium-aluminum alloy frame, the guns
          deliver a rapid "kick" to the hands of the person
          firing them. "Recoil is an issue," Belin said.
          The gun can fire less-powerful rounds than the .357
          magnum, for example the .38 special, that can reduce
          recoil. "You really have to work at not flinching
          (when firing,)" Belin said.
          Smith & Wesson officials believe there may be another
          market for the super-light guns. They have developed
          a prototype scandium alloy gun that could be carried
          by flight crews on commercial airliners. There have
          been calls for flight crews to be armed, although no
          steps have been taken by the government in that
          direction.
          The Smith & Wesson prototypes are black with an
          internal hammer, so they could be carried in a
          trouser or jacket pocket without catching on the
          fabric. The guns could be modified to fire a
          lower-velocity round, which is less likely to cause
          damage to an aircraft, officials said.
          The prototype air crew guns have not been publicly
          revealed before, Belin said. A spokesman said the
          prototypes are simply a design concept and will not
          necessarily be produced or be shared with people
          outside the company.

        SOURCE: Ozolutions Inc.
            Ozolutions Announces an Agreement in Principle to
         Provide Hankin Water Purification System to Homeowners
          Ontario Distributor Will Offer Purification System To
                       Homebuilders And Homebuyers
        TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 4, 2001-- Ozolutions
        Inc. (OTCBB:OZLU - news), an international distributor
        of water purification systems, announced today that it
        had entered into an agreement in principle with one of
        Canada's largest providers of home comfort systems to
        offer the the option of having the Hankin Ozone
        EntrOzone water purification system installed both in
        existing and new homes across Ontario.
        Based on initial test market results, Ozolutions will
        develop a marketing strategy and technical support
        program that will benefit all home builders that offer
        their new residential customers water purification as
        part of a home utilities package that is generally
        offered in home developments.
        There is increased public awareness about the quality
        of water and the Hankin EntrOzone system is a secure,
        safe, reliable, and affordable product that delivers
        purified water. Hankin has been in business over 65
        years and has an ozone-based treatment of water that
        far surpasses the normal chlorine and filter
        techniques. The EntrOzone is a unique combination of
        technologies including ozone (electrically charged
        water molecules), Ultra-Violet light, and activated
        carbon filters that provide maximum protection against
        bacteria, viruses, metal contaminants and harmful
        chemicals including pesticides that may infiltrate
        sources of drinking water.
        Ozolutions will also offer homebuilders and homeowners
        complete servicing and financing for EntrOzone buyers.
        The company estimates the sale of 2400 EntrOzone units
        through its preferred home services distribution
        channel and the additional sale of 600 units through
        company direct and dealer sales. EntrOzone has a
        suggested retail price of $4000 (USD) and, based on
        current sales estimates, Ozolutions initial projections
        indicate potential gross revenues of approximately
        $8,000,000 (USD) over the next 12 months. Max
        Weissengruber, President of Ozolutions said, "The
        opportunity for our company to deliver the Hankin
        technology to one of Canada's largest providers of home
        comfort appliances is exciting. Ozolutions and the home
        product supplier are exploring the strategic
        implementation of the agreement and we are confident
        that homebuilders and homeowners will be delighted with
        the product, service, and cost effectiveness of having
        a reliable supply of purified water.''

        The MarketPlace for Ozone treated water is rapidly
        growing. There are presently more than 250 ozone
        treatment plants under design or construction in the
        United States. As water treatment plants respond to US
        Environmental Protection Agency regulations, more than
        10,000 smaller drinking water treatment facilities will
        be looking to add ozone oxidation processes to their
        drinking water.
        Ozone treated water is also important to:
           * Tourism
           * Business Consumers
           * Waste Water Treatment
           * Fish Hatcheries
           * Municipalities
           * Urban & Rural Home builders
        The proximity of the Mexican market and the Caribbean
        market provides an extremely cost-effective platform
        for sales, shipment, and service. As part of their
        strategic marketing plan, Ozolutions is developing a
        dealer network of independent agents and contractors
        capable of selling, installing systems and servicing
        customers.
