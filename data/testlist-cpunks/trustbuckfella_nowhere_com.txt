An alternative model of electronic money.
Every model of electronic money I know of except one retains some degree
of centralization. There is always a central "mint", usually a bank. If
you can't find a bank that acts the way you want, you're SOL. And the
only thing that enforces non-abuse (inflation, etc) by the bank is the
equivalence of electronic money to some form of "real" money. The sole
exception is Digicash. Unfortunately, Digicash has no restraint on
infinite spending-into-debt.
I want to present an alternative model I call "TrustBucks". TrustBucks
is decentralized but zero-sum and needs no assistance from "real"
currency. Its central idea is a "web of trust": Local, trusted contacts
are linked in a web that at some remove can extend everywhere.
I'm not going to try to develop the cryptographic protocols for
TrustBucks. I haven't got the requisite paranoia and pickiness
(compliments both) for that. TrustBucks also has nothing in the way of
anonymity and restraint on double-spending right now. If you can see how
it could be anonymous or restrain double-spending and still work, please
feel free to add.
The basic rules of TrustBucks:

tcmay at got.net (Timothy C. May):
Mistaken terminology, mea culpa. The scheme I was thinking of is
actually called Private Currency. Someone mistakenly labelled the
writeup Digicash and I cut and pasted without thinking. I do know the
difference when my brain is on.
s/Digicash/Private Currency. Apologies to Digicash.
I'll explain Private Currency and why it's good and bad. In Private
Currency you don't "buy the [money] someplace". You mint it when paying.
Alice and Bob check each other's public debt and if neither is scared
off by the other's high debt, they mint a debt for Alice and money for
Bob. They publish a record of the transaction, which is how they knew
each other's public debt in the first step. So in theory the amount of
currency in existance is exactly 0. In practice I wouldn't trust anyone
for a debt that I didn't trust directly for that amount. I believe the
scheme would stall.
I conceived TrustBucks as an alternative that would retain the
decentralization but work.
Fine. I doubt my mechanisms will be optimal but here you go.
Restraint on double-spending: Each participant publishes a list of the
    ID and value all outstanding TrustBucks of their own variety. Value
    of the notes can be obscured so it can only be verified by someone
    who has seen the note itself.
    What if some participant doesn't publish a complete list? Well, who
    are they robbing? People who directly trusted them for that amount
    and now won't ever again.
Anonymity: Each participant identifies their currency by a randomly
    chosen ID-number instead of name and publishes their ID/value under
    that number.
    However, it's pretty pointless, since the chain of trust has a hard
    time extending beyond people who directly know each other anyways.
A better objection would have been that it's hard to identify a chain of
mutually trusting links between two strangers who want to make a

I admit, my analysis is probably flawed and I appreciate you challenging
me on it. But I think it's more complex than the net result of single
The way I figure it, if Bob could accept / not accept any variety of
TrustBucks, then he can manipulate what varieties he reports being able
to give in order to escape debts or manipulate what varieties he reports
being able to accept in order to keep debts unpaid (for interest,
foreclosure, etc.)
    For instance, Alice is paying off her credit card, which pays Bob a
    big 17% interest. Bob would rather not let her off early. "Nope, we
    aren't accepting TrustBucks( Carol ) this week. TrustBucks( Dave )?
    Let me see.... hmm... nope, sorry ma'am."
    For instance, Alice has just eaten at Le Cafe Bob, and is about to
    leave. Presented with the cybercheck, she "discovers" that she
    hasn't got anything Bob is willing to accept. "Sorry 'bout that,
    Bob. Ooh, hafta run! Bye bye."
So it seems to me that the simplest course is to allow payment in
exactly one variety, the payee's own. Bob can't credibly claim to not
trust himself.
You might object that the same problem is incurred anyways in
TrustBucks. If Bob refuses to trade TrustBucks( Bob ) for TrustBucks(
Carol ), isn't it the same thing as refusing TrustBucks( Carol )?
I think it's subtly different, though. If Bob can accept other people's
currency, he need not issue any himself. He can credibly refuse early
payment, since no TrustBucks( Bob ) even exist. If Bob can only accept
TrustBucks( Bob ), then Alice, who reports having no TrustBucks( Bob ),
can't "innocently" incur debts she finds she cannot pay.
As I said, my mechanisms are probably suboptimal and possibly flawed.
That's why initially I presented TrustBucks without extraneous
mechanisms until that was objected to.
However, in this case the information that is wanted is whether a
certain note is outstanding or not. The sum of the list is not needed.
Indeed, one could have multiple lists for multiple identities. Or so it
seems to me.
Come to think of it, including the value doesn't do much.
