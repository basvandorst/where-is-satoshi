Radioactivity is almost uniquely insensitive to tampering through environmental
influences, though, owing to the large energy scale of nuclear processes [1].
Unfortunately, it does not automatically follow that the circuit used to
detect it is also similarly robust, and NSA would probably be able to
easily develop the capability to eavesdrop on Geiger-counter based RNGs
if they become widespread.  A high DC voltage, and abrupt current pulses -
this is sounding rather similar to a spark-gap transmitter.
[1] A handful of exceptions exist involving low-energy beta decays, such as
Dy-163 and Re-187.
