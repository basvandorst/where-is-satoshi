Never fear; if you forget your password and the secret token used for
authentication if you forget your password, they will still auth you.
All they need is your account info, birthdate, and the last 4 digits of
your SSN.
Secure, indeed.  Even after most people realize the utility of
relatively strong _required_ passwords being used, as they often are in
movies, to deal with banks, they are satisfied when real banks use two
publicly available pieces of information and 13 bits of your
maybe-or-maybe-not-so-secure SSN is good enough.
Imagine the panic if Americans were required to use passwords like
"b2\9690d" to access their bank accounts.  I suppose the objection would
be that we're not all as smart as Michael Douglas.  (That's the password
for one of his accounts in "The Game.")
