@_subject: [liberationtech] What I've learned from Cryptocat 
Hi Libtech,
Maxim Kammerer replied:
Maxim's comments match my thoughts with regards to both current
Cryptocat over SSL and my analogy to Riseup webmail over SSL.
If Riseup does what they say they do[1], emails sitting on their servers
are not mined for advertising or LE (unlike Facebook chat, or as Maxim
suggests, gmail); their servers do not log IPs; IPs are not embedded in
emails; and outgoing emails to other secure email providers are
encrypted (StartTLS).
Furthermore, it appears Riseup plans[2] encryption for stored emails on
their servers in the future. Such a scheme would make the emails
difficult for LE, or more broadly, attackers, to get, even with a
warrant -- not only would they have to obtain forced decryption power,
which I don't think they have as of yet in the US, but also Riseup might
not be able to provide the relevant keys in any case. (That the NSA has
copies is a vulnerability, but perhaps not a relevant one, as to my
knowledge LE can't introduce NSA copies as evidence.)
Similarly with current Cryptocat over SSL: if the server and server
operator do what they say they do, there aren't data-mining operations
going on for the benefit of LE or advertisers.
Both Riseup and current Cryptocat over SSL rely on good SSL connections
and also trust that the server and server operator aren't compromised
(including incorrect implementations). Those 3 dependencies are far from
ideal, but at least the risk calculations are ones some activists
without access to OTR or PGP or their own .mx can make. Better than
known bad actors, known bad servers.
Maybe my technical understanding is lacking something here, but I
believe the above to be correct.

Here is an article about the 4 US residents in question:
Here is the indictment PDF:
According to the PDF, defendants "conspired to provide material support
and resources, including but not limited to property, services, and
personnel, including themselves, knowing and intending that they be used
in preparation for, and in carrying out, crimes of terrorism in
violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 2339A."
The indictment uses (among other things) social media likes/shares as
evidence that there is "probable cause to believe" defendants violated
the law, but, from what I can discern, does not say the likes/shares
themselves constituted material support per se. From my inexpert reading
of the indictment, it suggests that (there is probable cause to believe
that) the defendants themselves constituted the material support. Sort
of a strange existential distinction there...
Somebody who has more legal knowledge than I might be able to comment on
this more usefully.

Greenbacks' billionaire backer Pierre Omidyar makes the PayPal 14 pay
$86,000 for Distributed Denial-of-Service attacks (DDOS), so we are
promoting Distributed Donations-of-Support (DDOS):
Without need of celebrities or go-betweens, you can donate directly to
the PayPal 14 at that page. If you can't chip in, please share that page
and ask people to go back to their roots by helping political
prisoners/hostages directly.
The first week the op raised $5,052.
The second week the op raised $2,298.
Tonight alone the op raised $180.
We had no SONY movie deal and didn't redact anything.
I am sure people who have difficulty unhitching their wagons from
celebrities and 'Thought Leaders' will say what a bad idea it is to
attack Redaction White Man who is telling multi-millionaire anchors
about the NSA to an audience who has already gotten the message the NSA
spies on every undefended gizmo. By the way, the US is not the world;
did you know Nigeria has 'NSA capability' from Israeli tech?

I've an odd question. Is there a program that will generate passwords
that imitate the badness with which humans armed with pen and paper only
would generate randomness? No, not a program that spits out "password"
over and over, that contemptible most frequently used password; I'm
imagining an English speaker of above average intelligence who has some
familiarity with best practices for coming up with passwords, but who's
no mathematical crypto wizard or anything.
Imagine a human who wants to generate an alphanumeric passphrase with
both upper- and lowercase, and he's in a jail cell with just pen and
paper. So he has a set of 62 characters to work with, and he tries to
write out a truly random password. But maybe he puts "M" in the password
too often for it to be truly random, because his name is Mario, so he
thinks about "M" unusually often; or maybe his writing surface is shaped
such that it incentivizes long downstrokes, so he pens the letter "l"
too often for true randomness.
Now, has anyone created a computer program to MIMIC what that human
would come up with? Is such a thing possible? Obviously I could simply
do it myself as a human being by, you know, qrMt8x3, but I want a
program that will create that for an x-long, say, 80,000 character-long,

References: Retweeted those; think Maurizi did great with all that.
But I want to throw something out there as a devil's advocate. I've
contacted appropriate US agencies for comment on some of my articles -
- and one gets the usual they deny versus we report. And arguably their
denials can be revealing of additional information.
But what about the no-platform idea coming out of, e.g., Anti-Racist
Action in the U.S.? Where you simply deny your enemies the microphone to
speak out of at all. Why give them a platform?
A simple example other than these IC/MIC articles, because it's on my
mind - I was at a  protest yesterday. Tweeted that
there was a local MSM TV affiliate news van driving in toward the police
department, on the grounds that they got past the barricade whereas
presumably "civilian" vehicles wouldn't, and so that's supposedly
interesting. But is it? Hasn't everyone got that memo already? Who gives
a damn about the MSM any longer? Every platform/discussion given to them
is a platform not given to something potentially more valuable. I don't
think one could argue that "well you could just tweet additional stuff;
it's not either-or" because we all know there is a "tweetcost" of
annoying your audience or, more importantly, distracting them with
pointless information, in this case, about the relationship between
police and MSM.
I suppose that relationship is still pretty important to comment on, and
it's tactical information for activists to know which MSM trucks are
there...maybe I'm just irritated at the seeming pointlessness of this
all, the fetish that sheer information accomplishes infinite wonders in
the absense of analysis and action.

this, the radicals are isolated and left without support.
So skip the establishment. I know this might be heretical to most of

1. It's not my theory, but what do you make of the theory that WikiLeaks
would go under if it were not of the steady stream of celebrity
endorsements (Lady Gaga, Pamela Anderson, many more)? Is hugely
emphasized "soft power" a necessary component for a cabal out to change
the world? Or could, say, a cabal demonstrate more independence and
still be supported by enough people who do not need their hands held to
the conclusion by Lady Gaga?
2. How could/should an organization with more than two million followers
tweet in order to improve the world? Could it give the public specific,
actionable instructions for overthrowing governments and corporations?
They might have to be less specific, so as not to qualify as threats
that would get the account closed. But the account could massively
amplify the instructions to the public given by victims such as Doctors
Without Borders. Or it could organize boycotts of private spy firms such
as Stratfor. What do you think? People who care about branding might
argue that such tweets wouldn't fit WikiLeaks' brand, but things can be
easily framed as freedom of the press/speech or crytography--e.g.,
something like Israel's attacks on Gaza: you can't publish accounts of
injuctice with Tor when bombed to death.

There are specific ops I could promote ( for example),
but I think maybe this question should be answered in a more general
way. And I think what we should often do is, help the victims of
whichever injustice attain the goals they're trying to reach. In other
words, let the victims choose and lead toward the objectives. So, to
take a current example, Doctors Without Borders, having had their Kunduz
hospital just bombed, wants an IHFFC investigation. How can we help with
that? And so on for other injustices. A caveat being that most people,
in the US anyway, can't think outside the box of capitalism, but trying

Perhaps the spam websites need to hide only text that is "real" in the
eyes of Google. And "Bell further alleged in his 2003" is "real" because
it is in a book. It could have been text out of any other book, but it
turned out to be you. Like winning the lottery, but in reverse. Perhaps
you could analyze strings of the other hidden text to see if they too
are from "real" sources.
I come up with this hypothesis because years back I used to write web
advertisements for an ambulance chaser law firm. They gave me the
original text, e.g., "If you or someone you care about has been injured
in an 18-wheeler accident in Atlanta, blah blah" and I had to write it
six hundred different ways, e.g. "If you or someone you love has been
hurt in a big rig crash in Atlanta, blah blah" Each version became its
own URL. The text of each had to be different, the law firm told me, or
Google would notice the similarities and penalize the websites for being
spam. It was a boring gig so I livened it up by writing in metric prose
- one sentence here in trochees, another sentence there in anapests, etc.
So "real" text is valuable.
That leads me to wonder, like a science fiction writer, how we could
take this to extremes. Which text is the most "real"? What might the
consequences be of variations in the degree of lorem ipsum texts' reality?
