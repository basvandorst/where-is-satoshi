Certainly. There are a couple of ways, but all one needs is some sort of gateway to an e-cash, which is simply e-money without identification. The gateway could take the form of a human intermediary, with either services or physical goods being the medium of exchange, or simply an exchange server which takes a cut off the top, as happens in the street all the time in countries that have currency restrictions.

The existing underground economy uses the same money as the aboveground  economy (i.e. paper money, for the most part).  Could a significant  underground digital economy develop if the aboveground digital economy  used only identified e-money?
