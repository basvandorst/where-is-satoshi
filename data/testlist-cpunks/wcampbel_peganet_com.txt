Actually, it should be pointed out that the Money Clip
is actually a Smarty Smart Card Reader (from Fischer
International) , not a "diskette".

Another point on all this that was made by Matt Blaze at the RSA
conference (and that I have been making to all my friends) is that Crypto
is basically a "solved" problem. The government's efforts to impose
GAK is in effect transposing a "solved" problem into an "unsolved"
problem - due to the inherent problems with any conceivable
GAK "solution". I thought this was a very good case against GAK.

@_subject: Anyone have the complete info on CP list alternatives? 
Everyone and his/her cousin has jumped into the void
created when John Gilmore decided to pull the plug
on toad.com.
However, I'm very confused on just what to do at this
point, my news server doesn't see alt.cypherpunks
yet and if it did would probably lose about 75% of
the posts if past performance is to be any indicator.
(Or more accurately, would never get them, we seem
to be a bottom feeder here in South Florida as far
as the newsgroups go.)
Has anyone composed a concise summary of just
what the options are? Time is running out, I guess.
Thanks in advance.

Toto  If what you say is true, then Dr. DV K's efforts are quite possibly   As a long time lurker (much longer than many of the numerous
relatively recent vociferous posters) I *must* speak up.
  If the dear "Doctor's" posting are indeed a "grand" experiment
in newsgroup (or maillist) sociology, then it seems they are akin to
experiments in recent history; if the patient dies, so what? There are
other lists...
  While many of you think that the ability of a list to withstand
constant spamming is an important issue; the government is busily
working to outlaw encryption and privacy, and I fear that much
is lost by the side issue of the "how easily can I kill a list".
I feel we at a *critical* crossroads in this debate, and one of the
more important voices has *very* effectively been silenced.
  This is very true, but I cannot understand why you think that
the attempt to disrupt and destroy this list a necessary step
in the task of resisting this governmental effort.
  Again, I can't understand why "killing the messenger" is advancing
the issues of privacy and crypto issues. How does the posting of
numerous crude anti-Tim May messages promote personal privacy?
  This seems horribly to describe the current situation.

I thought my meaning was obvious, but thanks for pointing it out
to those who didn't get it.
  When I first began reading this list, I realized that a lot of
important information was being put out; and it certainly raised
my awareness of issues that I had not previously thought about.
I believe that many other subscribers to the list also were exposed
to many of these concepts, and that many subscribers to the list
were people who could make a difference.
  I fear that many have now left the list, since it now seems to
resemble, in many ways, a list consisting of high school age
"wannabes" who think it's really cool to attack people just
because they can.
  The downward spiral into inconsequential meaningless postings
began with posts containing the word "fart".
  So cool, dudes.

I have been watching the confirmation hearings for William Daley,
and I was amazed at the number of references in the questioning
to encryption. I have been watching confirmation hearings for a long
time and have never noticed this much attention being placed on such
a (formerly?) obscure topic.
It appears that encryption is definitely a big blip on the
governmental radar screen now, although whether this is a good
thing or a bad thing is definitely a debatable question. It's
interesting to me that all this interest is coming up in a
confirmation hearing for a *commerce* secretary. Maybe the
commercial aspects of encryption can have a positive impact
on the current restrictions; privacy rights certainly haven't had
any impact.

This "freely available overseas" concept is a bit overstated.
France and other countries are beginning to come down hard
on encryption. (Also note the post from the guy in New
Zealand on the hassles exporting from his country.) The US now has a "Crypto Ambassador" roaming the world,
and I *don't* think he is encouraging an open common
encryption standard.
  Cynic or realist, you make the call.  The average Joe
doesn't even know *why* he needs encryption...at least
not yet.

I've been trying to get a copy of the Crypto CD using the ISBN

bookstore I've checked with can find no reference to it. Has
anyone on the list gotten it via this method? I looked for
Pini's web page but it appears to be gone. Anyone know
about sources for the CD?
