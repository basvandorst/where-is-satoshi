Hang on!  This is interesting - keep in on-list!
What's the big deal about not having signed his own key?
The only thing that signing your own key does is show the
[claimed] id of the real keyholder.  There's no scope for
abuse.  Claiming this to be an armour door and open window
is overreacting a bit.

@_subject: appropriate algorithm for application 
Are you after a working program, or just a design?
You could always use an escrowed public key generator (discussed on
sci.crypt some time ago), where the keys all have a factor of 'N'
embedded in 'N', but encrypted with the master key.
(I'd be prepared to write the code that generates the keys, if
someone does the "master decrypt" side of things).

The main reason is so that anyone can generate new keys as and when
they please. The master key is not required for key generation, which
makes it more secure (ie. it spends more of its time in the safe) and
practical (the master key may be in a different building).

Police prepare stunning end for high-speed car chases                                     BY GILES WHITTELL                                     AND NIGEL HAWKES          IT COULD be the end of the car chase as we know it. With the automotive equivalent of
         a stun gun, science fiction is coming to the aid of law enforcement.          A high-powered electrical device under development at the Pentagon's Army Research
         Laboratory in Adelphi, Maryland, is to be tested by police and border patrol agents and
         could be in use by next year.          The car stopper works by focusing an intense electromagnetic charge on the electronic
         systems that manage most modern engines, disabling them and paralysing the car. In
         the jargon of its inventors, the 150 kilovolt charge is a nemp, or non-nuclear
         electromagnetic pulse. Contractors are bidding to produce a police version.          Very precisely directed beams are required, but even then there will be problems. A
         pulse powerful enough to disable an engine at any reasonable range would also be likely
         to disrupt communications, damage television and radio sets, disable computers and
         even stop heart pacemakers. There is also the danger of loss of control when a car is
         being driven at high speed.          Counter-measures would include using old-fashioned engines with no electronics, or
         perhaps surrounding the most delicate components with shielding. The best might be to
         get hold of one of the stun guns and use it to disable pursuing police vehicles. Original article at Three questions come to mind:

A new ALPHA release of the Systemics Cryptix crypto library for Java is
now available for download at The library is FREE FOR COMMERCIAL AND NON-COMMERCIAL USE.
This release of the library is only intended for serious developers,
who are prepared to work with a moving API.
Differences from the previous release are that the library is now 100%
Java, although native code can still be loaded if the libraries are
present (which is unlikely, since I haven't completed them yet :-)
Also, PGP classes have now been incorportated into the library.
And of course, all the source is available (in fact, that's all that
is presently available :-)
                 CRYPTIX 2.00 - CRYPTOGRAPHIC CLASSES FOR JAVA
     _________________________________________________________________
   This library contains a suite of cryptographic classes for Java. It is
   important to note that this release is not yet stable, so is only
   recommended for use by serious developers, since there may be major
   design and API changes. For users that require stability, please use
   the previous release .
Features missing
   DES and Blowfish are not yet ported to Java.
   There is currently very little in the way of documentation and example
   programs.
   The auto loading of native libraries (if they are present) has not
   been tested.
   The library is now 100% Java, although native libraries will be loaded
   if they are present, in order to improve performance.
   PGP support is now being added to the library (currently most PGP
   packet types are supported, except for compressed data packets -
   anyone developing a zip compression library in Java?).
Mailing list
   A mailing list exists for the developers and users of this library.
   This list is very low volume, and can be joined by sending
          subscribe cryptix-java _your mail address_
   to majordomo at systemics.com.
   Another mailing list exists for PGP developers, and can be joined by

@_subject: Mondex 
Any anonymity derives from the fact that Mondex cards are bearer devices.  Sure, a real name may have to be used to obtain a card, but I don't see how Mondex can prevent the cards being passed on.  One would guess that they could only realistically achieve this if the card were embedded in a credit card or something similar.
As far as I can see, the transactions have to be untraceable, as long as user to user transactions can occur, and there is no limit to the number of transactions per card.  Even if the cards record the last 300 (as rumours suggest) transactions, that just means I have to perform 300 transactions between a pair of my cards in order to erase the "interesting" history.  The ability to erase the history could only be prevented by restricting the number of transactions per card, or by preventing card to card transactions.
There does seem to be some scope for other tracing tricks however.  For instance, it may be possible for a card to remember IDs of the last few hundred cards it has communicated with.  However, if we know this, then we just have to have a few hundred cards of our own to "erase" the interesting Bear in mind that it may be possible for all "electronic coins" that are issued to be given a serial number.  There would be no tricks to circumvent this, but of course tracing can only occur when the money leaves and enters the bank (and perhaps at every shop counter), so the usefulness of this is limited if many user to user transactions are occurring.  I don't think Mondex does this, though, since the memory requirements seem to be too large for todays smartcards.  What I *guess* Mondex does do though, is "mark" coins in certain situations - eg. a kidnapper is paid a ransom via cellphone in another country using Mondex, but the coins are marked. They will stay marked no matter how many times they are transferred, and eventually will be caught by the system (either as they are deposited into an account, or perhaps via shop terminals looking for the mark).  This would not ensure the catching of the kidnapper, but at least gives the authorities a start.  It may also be possible to put a time limit on these expired coins, so that the money "vanishes" some time after the baby is returned alive (or whatever).

@_subject: Noise: Re: Those Evil Republicans 
Andorra is a self governing sovereign nation - the French president and
Spanish bishop play only titular roles.
Regarding Jersey and the Isle of Man, I misunderstood the requirement for
the countries to be independant - we were after all discussing countries
which have no control over their currencies.  Still, there are many
non-independant countries that do not use the currency of the country
they are dependent on - for example Bermuda and BVI (both UK dependent)
use the US dollar.  Many of the Caribbean islands which are UK dependent
(eg. Anguilla) use East Caribbean dollars.
There are also several independent sovereign nations that have no control
over their own currency (eg. Liechtenstein (the one you mentioned), Andorra,
Monaco, Nauru, Marshall Islands, Micronesia and Pueto Rico).  One could
even argue that countries such as Cuba have relinquished control over
their own currency by tying their Peso to the US dollar (which is also
widely used in Cuba).  The same could perhaps be said of Luxembourg.
First of all, "parasitic" is a very derogatory term to apply to these
nations.  They are no more parasitic than out of town supermarkets.
Second, you suggest Liechenstein as a useful model for a modern
industrial society that has no control over its currency, but then go
on to criticise Andorra as a useful model.  Why?
Third, you have missed the point I was making, that of Goodhearts law,
which loosely states that "attempts by the government to regulate or
tax one channel of banking business quickly lead to the same business
being conducted through a different channel which is untaxed or
unregulated".  Surely the fact that every large nation has its
banking tax havens (eg. UK has the Channel Islands, the US has the
Caribbean islands) is proof of this?

do it.  Offers?
With regard to the local decryption idea, then I don't see this as
much of a problem.  How much interest is there in this?  We already
have something similar running, but it would still need a bit of work
to make more general.

PGP LIBRARY FOR PERL
     _________________________________________________________________
                                  DESCRIPTION
   This library contains a suite of PGP modules for Perl. Many of the
   modules require the Systemics Cryptix 1.1 library.
   Although the library is quite usable, it is still a long way from
   being complete, and the interface subject to change.
                                   FEATURES
   This library contains the modules to do the following:
     * PGP ascii armouring
     * PGP conventional encryption
     * PGP public key encryption/decryption
     * PGP key generation, including vanity keys!
   Note - the current version cannot handle compressed data packets,
   does not handle signatures, and the key management is quite poor.
   The library can be downloaded from    Enjoy!

@_subject: Backdoor in RSA Discovered 
Here is an example of a PGP key that has been generated, but with
a secret backdoor.  It is not possible by looking at the generated
key to see that it has a backdoor.
The key generation code contains Mallets public key.  When generating
a key, the upper bytes of N are set to an encrypted factor of N.
The encryption is done using Mallets public key, so only Mallet
can retrieve the factor from N.
I think this example demonstrates the need not only for having key
generation source code (which is required anyway in order to verify
the quality of the random number generator), but also for being able
to compile and link this source, since without this ability it is too
easy to have such a backdoor in the system  (yes, the code could be
reversed engineered, but this can be made very difficult by having
self modifying code etc.)
There does however appear to be one way to assure the user that
this trickery is not going on.  This can be done by generating
"vanity keys", that allow the user to specify a phrase that
will appear in the PGP ascii key.  If this were done, then there
would be little room left in N to store details about its factors.
Here is a working example of this backdoor:
This is Mallets secret key (passphrase "xyzzy"):
The key consists of the following:
This is Joe's PGP key (passphrase is "xyzzy"):
The key consists of the following:
If we look at bytes 1-63 of n:
and decrypt this using Mallets private 'd', we get
which you can see is Joe's P without the leading 0x80 and trailing 0x01
Here is the code (in Perl) that generated Joe's key.
This code contains only Mallets public key.
This is the code to recover P from Joes public key
(Mallet's private key is required)

If the secret key is available then an attacker knows the length
of p & q.  Admittedly this will not usually help matters much,
but I still feel that the lengths of p and q should be encrypted
with the passphrase - perhaps in PGP3.0? (Derek?)

@_subject: Security of PGP if Secret Key Available? 
That's what I said.  There are however a few cases where it may help.
Two that spring to mind are the brute force factoring of the
BlackNet key - this may have been faster if half of the potential
factors could have been ignored due to wrong key lengths (although I
suspect this depends upon the factoring algorithm), and the other
is that of identifying low quality keys with a small factor (perhaps
generated by low quality software).
Again, I would say this depends upon the factoring algorithm.

It's a case of giving the payor a blinded unsigned coin and demanding he get the bank
to sign it - if he doesn't do this the payee will notice immediately.
Even with payor and bank collusion there is nothing that can be done to identify

CRYPTOGRAPHIC EXTENSIONS FOR PERL
     _________________________________________________________________
                                  DESCRIPTION
   This library contains a suite of cryptographic extensions for Perl.
   Also included are some extensions that have a cryptographic relevance,
   such as the Compress::Zlib modules, and the TrulyRandom module.
   These modules have been developed as extensions for performance
   reasons.
   Now available for download at                                    FEATURES
   All of the following have been implemented as Perl extensions in C:
     * BigInteger module (based on code from Eric Young).        This module implements arbitrary length integers and some
       associated mathematical functions.
     * Compress::Zlib module (by Paul Marquess).
       A Perl interface to Jean-loup Gailly's and Mark Adler's info-zip
       zlib compression library.
     * Crypt::DES module (DES implementation by Eric Young).      * Crypt::IDEA module.      * Crypt::MD5 module (by Neil Winton and Data Security, Inc.)      * Crypt::PRSG - Pseudo random sequence generator        This module implements a 160 bit LFSR for use in generating pseudo
       random sequences.
     * Crypt::SHA module (by Uwe Hollerbach and based on code from NIST
       and Peter C. Gutmann)      * Utils::TrulyRandom module, based on code from Don Mitchell and
       Matt Blaze (AT&T).        This module generates "truly random" numbers, based on interrupt
       timing discrepancies.

in this case was Myna Communications).  However, the machine/ISP will have

This is the double spending problem.
Given that untraceability of tradable cards is less of an issue than
with e-cash, why not have a central registry of the owners of the cards
(which would consist of the card details paired with the public key
of the owner)?  Admittedly this means the players must be on line,
but then we all know how difficult off line detection of double
spenders is.
For anyone who is _serious_ about starting work on such a game
system, I have a few pieces of Perl and Java code that would really
get you on your way - let me know if you are interested.

Sounds like they are doing something like this:
        Generate a prime P of 500 bits (say)
        Encrypt with Mallets public key
        Generate start_q using (E(P) << 524)/P
        Keep incrementing start_q until prime, and call this Q
        Generate N by multiplying P and Q to get a 1024 bit key
        Top 500 bits of N will be E(P)
It could also be done like this:
        Generate a random H of, say, 290 bits
        Keep incrementing H until (H << 300) + 1 is prime
        and call this Q
        Encrypt H for Mallet
        H <<= 10
        Keep incrementing H until prime
        Generate N by multiplying P by Q, to get a 900 bit key
        Bottom 300 (but 10) bits of N will E(P)
I'm sure there are few mistakes, and there need to be
a few other trivial tests in there somewhere, but I think this
should work.
The first method should produce "better" keys than the first
(as if Mallet cares)
I'll try and knock some code up to demonstrate this over the next
few days.

Hmm - I don't know I managed to make this post - I had started writing
a reply, but exited my mailer, and for some reason it decided to send a
cut down version of the unfinished mail anyway ...
Exactly - I spent ages on the same thing.  Then there's the problem that
packet length headers must be specific lengths for various types (eg.
key certificates must have a 2 byte length, even if only one is required).
It is also not clear what the exported key certificates should contain,
the spec simply mentioning that there should be no trust packets etc. etc.
I agree with your comments.  For example, we are developing PGP compatible
libraries in both Perl and Java, and are going to add SHA, Blowfish, T-DES,
etc., along with a better key ring format, encrypted key rings, and features
such as key generation from a passphrase, and we would very much like to
remain compatible with the new PGP, but how can we when there is so little
information available?  I think we need a forum to discuss PGP development
issues - I would be happy to set one up if there was interest.

@_subject: Taxation Thought Experiment 
The government gets $59.26, not $49.26 (30+16+12+1.26).
That leaves you with 16.74 (not 16.82) - they get nearly four
times as much.
In other countries the situation may be worse, not only due to different
rates of tax, but because of social security contributions, employers tax,
and the like.
Then if you spend your money on beer or fags, you may be paying even
more tax, due to taxes on alcohol and tobacco, leaving the government
with perhaps 10 times as much money as you.  Many imported goods also have
a tax on them (eg. motorcycle import tax is around 50% in the UK).
It is probably more fun to do these calculations without involving
the shareholders, since they are, after all, earning their "cut".

@_subject: I'm Confused about Algorithm Patents in Canada 
Yes, this certainly seems to be a grey area.  For instance, the MD of
Digicash said recently that they have a worldwide patent on blinding,
but I am a little puzzled by this - I thought the patents had to be
applied for in each country individually.  Also, Article 52(1) of the
European Patent Convention (EPC) reads:
        susceptible of industrial applications, which are new and which
        involve an inventive step."
        The EPC does not define what is meant by inventions, but Article
        52(2) lists subject-matter and activities "which shall not be
        regarded as inventions" within the meaning of Article 52(1), in
        particular:
        - discoveries, scientific theories and mathematical methods
                                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        - aesthetic creations
        - schemes, rules and methods for performing mental acts, playing
              or doing business, and programs for computers
                                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        - presentations of information
I no nothing of patent law, but this certainly does seem to imply that
algorithms themselves cannot be patented in Europe.  Any European patent
experts out there?

I wonder how they are doing this?  We know that the Germans allow full
internet access (don't they?), so they can't be using a filtering http
proxy.  I guess they're blocking on IP number (and perhaps port).  It
might be a good idea for xs4all to gather up all of their spare IP
numbers, and alias the lot on their web site - this would increase the
number of blocked addresses needed.  It might also be a good idea to run
some proxies on unusual ports (eg. smtp, DNS, pop, ftp ports) (although
of course this will then need to be a dedicated proxy machine) - again
this would increase the size of the blacklist that the Germans must use,
and may involve some awkward router programming (for example, a router
might be configured to allow all DNS traffic - if a proxy is sitting on
the DNS port, then things get a bit difficult to set up).  Of course,
netscape probably won't allow use of these ports (it certainly doesn't
allow the use of port 79).

This is probably a bit off-topic; if so I apologize.
Can anybody comment on the item forwarded below my sig file? It claims
there's a database w/ people's credit card no's etc on it and you have to
give your name and social security number to get off of it.  This strikes
me as being a scam to get your ssn, but this went around at work and
people are actually calling and giving it out.  I know ssn's aren't really
as secure as they're supposed to be, but  still...
So, does anybody know if this database is for real or if it's just a scam?

@_subject: 56 kbps modems 
The reason for this, Newsbytes discovered after a chat with Bill Pechey,
technical director with Hayes' European operations, is that the 56,000
bps modem system is actually a digital variant. Instead of the modem
using an audio channel of 3,600 hertz to the exchange, the modem works
across the standard copper wiring seen on most of the world's fixed wire
phone systems.
In order to achieve the 56,000 bps transmission rate, the Rockwell
chip-powered modem will actually physically control the codec at the
telephone exchange across the copper cable. According to Pechey, if a
full 4,000 hertz were available, then an ISDN (integrated service
digital network) channel of 64,000 bps would be available.
"Since the only 3,600 hertz of the audio channel is available through
the codec, we reckon that the maximum transmission speed is around
56,000 bps. Furthermore, because of the high power levels required to
achieve this transmission speed, the back channel will only operate at
standard (analog) modem speeds," he told Newsbytes.
Pechey told Newsbytes that this back channel will support data transfers
somewhere below the 28,800 bps levels, although he noted that Rockwell
claims that 28,800 bps is achievable under ideal conditions.
"This means that the 56K system is best suited for Internet access,
where the data is being transmitted mainly in one direction. For
applications such as videoconferencing, you'd be better off looking to
ISDN for a more balanced rate," he said, noting that the main advantage
of 56k technology over ISDN is the price.
"56K modem technology is cheaper than ISDN, since you don't need an ISDN
system installed. It will work across the standard phone network using a
standard phone socket," he said.
According to Pechey, because the technology involved is closer to
conventional analog modem systems than ISDN, adding 56K transmission
technology to a standard 28,800/33,600 bps modem will not be very
"Basically you'll have a black box that will work as a normal analog
modem at 28,800 or 33,600 bps or whatever, but when accessing the
Internet, providing the distant end of the link is a digital connection,
you'll be able to use 56K in one direction, and up to 23,800 bps in the
reverse direction," he said.

than what we have now."  -- Unknown.

Program compromises IE security                      By Nick Wingfield
                     September 23, 1996, 10:45 a.m. PT                                 A start-up Internet company has posted a
                     program on the Net that could allow Web sites to bypass
                     the security controls in Internet Explorer, CNET has
                     learned.                      The company, InfoSpace, created a program aimed at Net
                     search engines such as Lycos and Excite that want to
                     become the default search engine in Microsoft's Internet
                     Explorer 3.0. But the program, which is actually featured on
                     the Lycos Web site, manages to circumvent Explorer's
                     security warning window--an action that could let
                     InfoSpace sneak programs onto a user's personal computer
                     without warning.                      Although the InfoSpace program apparently was not created
                     with malicious intent, it underscores the fragility of Internet
                     Explorer's security defenses, as well as broader security
                     issues related to downloading software over the Internet.                      The InfoSpace program sidesteps a security feature in
                     Internet Explorer, called Authenticode, which is designed to
                     allow users to verify the origins of a piece of software code,
                     such as an ActiveX control, a script, or a plug-in. The
                     Authenticode system requires a user to entrust the
                     developer of a program, whether it's InfoSpace, Lotus
                     Development, or IBM, not to install viruses or other
                     destructive programs on the user's system.                      Although Authenticode does not prevent software
                     developers from creating such programs, they can be held
                     legally accountable for bad code. That's because the
                     programs contain "digital signatures," a sort of ID card that
                     allows perpetrators to be tracked down by law enforcement
                     agencies. Microsoft works with VeriSign to provide digital
                     signatures for programs.                      Last month, VeriSign took matters into its own hands by
                     asking a developer, Fred McLain, to remove an ActiveX
                     control called Exploder from his Web site. The Exploder
                     control was designed to crash a user's computer after
                     downloading.                      "Code signing is not a guarantee of code quality," Charles
                     Fitzgerald, a product manager at Microsoft said. "It's an
                     accountability trail."                      As with all digitally signed programs, users are offered the
                     option to accept or to reject the InfoSpace program before
                     installing it on their systems. Users are also offered the
                     option to bypass the Authenticode warning window for all
                     InfoSpace programs in the future.                      But the company's program registers InfoSpace as a
                     "trusted publisher" in Explorer, effectively opening the
                     browser to intrusions. The operation is akin to inviting a
                     guest over to your house for dinner and having them copy
                     the key to your front door without permission.                      InfoSpace executives denied that there was any malice
                     intended in its program, adding that it has provided Lycos
                     with an updated version of the code. Lycos plans to post the
                     new program later this evening, according to InfoSpace.
                     "It was a bug that got incorporated into the production
                     code," InfoSpace CEO Naveen Jain said.                      Lycos CEO Bob Davis said he was not aware of the bug in
                     the InfoSpace program and could not comment on it. The
                     program is identified as Lycos Quick Search on the search
                     engine's site.                      However, Microsoft officials expressed concern, saying it is
                     hard to defend against once a user has consented to
                     download code from the Net.                      "Clearly their software is doing something a tad
                     aggressive," said Rob Price, a group program manager for
                     Internet security at Microsoft."[With Authenticode], users
                     are making a one-time trust decision, this is a persistent
                     trust decision."                      Microsoft argued that Explorer provides better security than
                     Netscape Communications' Navigator, which does not
                     currently allow digital signatures on plug-ins. In Explorer,
                     users are warned before downloading code even if the
                     program does not contain a digital signature, though the
                     source of the program is not identified.                      In contrast to plug-in software and ActiveX controls, Java
                     applets are prevented from damaging a user's computer
                     through built-in restrictions in the Java Virtual Machine.                      "Java is the model for dynamic executable content on the
                     Net," said Eric Greenberg, group security manager at
                     Netscape.

                     allows perpetrators to be tracked down by law enforcement
                     agencies. Microsoft works with VeriSign to provide digital
                     signatures for programs.                      Last month, VeriSign took matters into its own hands by
                     asking a developer, Fred McLain, to remove an ActiveX
                     control called Exploder from his Web site. The Exploder
                     control was designed to crash a user's computer after
                     downloading.                      "Code signing is not a guarantee of code quality," Charles
                     Fitzgerald, a product manager at Microsoft said. "It's an
                     accountability trail."                      As with all digitally signed programs, users are offered the
                     option to accept or to reject the InfoSpace program before
                     installing it on their systems. Users are also offered the
                     option to bypass the Authenticode warning window for all
                     InfoSpace programs in the future.                      But the company's program registers InfoSpace as a
                     "trusted publisher" in Explorer, effectively opening the
                     browser to intrusions. The operation is akin to inviting a
                     guest over to your house for dinner and having them copy
                     the key to your front door without permission.                      InfoSpace executives denied that there was any malice
                     intended in its program, adding that it has provided Lycos
                     with an updated version of the code. Lycos plans to post the
                     new program later this evening, according to InfoSpace.
                     "It was a bug that got incorporated into the production
                     code," InfoSpace CEO Naveen Jain said.                      Lycos CEO Bob Davis said he was not aware of the bug in
                     the InfoSpace program and could not comment on it. The
                     program is identified as Lycos Quick Search on the search
                     engine's site.                      However, Microsoft officials expressed concern, saying it is
                     hard to defend against once a user has consented to
                     download code from the Net.                      "Clearly their software is doing something a tad
                     aggressive," said Rob Price, a group program manager for
                     Internet security at Microsoft."[With Authenticode], users
                     are making a one-time trust decision, this is a persistent
                     trust decision."                      Microsoft argued that Explorer provides better security than
                     Netscape Communications' Navigator, which does not
                     currently allow digital signatures on plug-ins. In Explorer,
                     users are warned before downloading code even if the
                     program does not contain a digital signature, though the
                     source of the program is not identified.                      In contrast to plug-in software and ActiveX controls, Java
                     applets are prevented from damaging a user's computer
                     through built-in restrictions in the Java Virtual Machine.                      "Java is the model for dynamic executable content on the
                     Net," said Eric Greenberg, group security manager at
                     Netscape.

This is starting to sound like Wired magazine.
I fail to see *any* (non educational) use for these DNA "computers", let
alone a cryptographic use - sure, they may be massively parallel, but
what's the big deal?  I can now perform a calculation a million times
faster than I could yesterday? (something I personally doubt, but will
agree to for sake of the argument).  I could get the same results
writing a cycle stealing Internet java app, so what's all the fuss

You know, the real problem with the average blackmailer is that they

@_subject: Tools for Rendering Censorship Firewalls Ineffective 
I would guess that most sites censoring http by IP would be doing so by
only censoring the http port.  If the http servers were to be run on
other ports too (perhaps well known ports like DNS), then this would
make life a little harder for the bad guys.  This would be especially
true if their routers were configured to allow ALL DNS requests through
(for example).  This may be a problem for some browsers (I know it's a
problem with netscape), as I mentioned a few weeks ago.
I have some encrypted HTTP relay software if anyone is interested in
setting up a server.

@_subject: SSL weakness affecting links from pa 
A couple of points.  Firstly, I don't see a need for the referer header to "traverse" different domains.  For example, if I have a local page called "dorks.html", with a link pointing to, say, David Sternlights home page,
then he can deduce my opinion of him by looking at the referrer field.
This puts an unnecessary burden on my local bookmark web pages - I can no longer give the pages reasonable names (such as "dorks.html").
Secondly, a back button should not be implemented using referer headers.  If I have a back button on my page, I expect it to do what the Netscape back button does.  However, this is not what happens - back buttons built into web pages create a long chain of "forward" links. (I'm probably not explaining myself too well here).  What is really required is a special type of link that does exactly what the netscape back button does (and it would also be nice if I could put forward links in my pages too).
Perhaps the latter objection is do-able in Javascript - it's been some time since I tried.

@_subject: Inflation-index bonds and private e-currency 
I would argue that it is the people, not the governments, that don't want a common currency in Europe.  Of course it's a different story with the poor EU But digital currencies will never become fiat currencies, let alone legal tender, unless governments say they are.  So why should they worry?  (OK, OK, they will worry about tax evasion etc. etc.)
You seem to be forgetting that trade is a two way operation.
I doubt this - I'm sure companies as well as people are more inclined to trust some private organisations than they are governments.  Of course there will always be a cost attached to the risk and ease of use.
Since you mentioned Greenspan, I thought I'd use the opportunity to quote him:
  "Regulation - which is based on force and fear - undermines the moral base
  of business dealings. It becomes cheaper to bribe a building inspector than
  to meet his standards of construction. A fly-by-night securities operator
  can quickly meet all the S.E.C. requirements, gain the inference of
  respectability, and proceed to fleece the public. In an unregulated
  economy, the operator would have had to spend a number of years in
  reputable dealings before he could earn a position of trust sufficient to
  induce a number of investors to place funds with him. Protection of the
  consumer by regulation is thus illusory."
