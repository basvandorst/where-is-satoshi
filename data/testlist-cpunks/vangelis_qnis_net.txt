May I ask what on earth possessed you to run on a non-expendable machine
a .COM attached to email sent by a spammer who obviously didn't even
have business-related intentions?

@_subject: Code+Data separation 
I dunno about processors which make that distinction, but it can be done
in software using page-protection features of the Intel CPU.  Under DPMI
for DOS and I would think somehow under Windows, the DATA segment can be
specified as loading into a seperate page/selector from the code (Im a
little hazy on the specifics), and that page then marked essentially as
"read only".
I think this was designed to make software more crash-resistant though,
not hack-resistance.  There's probably many ways to circumvent this
(explicity changing the access to that page, tricking the VMM into
swapping that page out to disk, then editting the swap file while it's
out there, etc).

Um, not it wasn't.  Not that I wouldn't put it past them, but I read a
1st-hand account of someone having this problem months before TWA 800
took a bath.

Private Idaho (for Windoze), without question.  It's freeware, and acts
as an almost seamless front-end to PGP.  I use it all the time w/ my
crpto-aware friends.

My feelings EXACTLY.  And the same reasoning behind my machine not being
put to work on these DES/RC4 cracking projects.  Instead it spends its
off-cycles factoring Merseinne primes - why?  Because it's the only
charity I can donate my spare CPU power to, WITHOUT having to sign forms
and other beauracratic garbage.
