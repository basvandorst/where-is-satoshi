While we're on the subject of "things that might go away", the Icom
IC-R1 is getting hard to find locally.  I bought the last one at
Quantel electronics for $450 or so.  (The R1 is a handheld

Actually, according to an ex-NSA'er I know, probably not the NSA.
They claim that this sort of thing gets attributed to them quite often
when they in fact have little, if anything, to do with "minor stuff
like that".  They went on to say "anybody who really *needs* to have
crypto cellular calls will already buys stuff from other countries and
modifies it for use here."  Think about the resources *that* implies.
Also, if the clipper thing is "minor", I'm not sure I want to know
what major is.

[forwarded for your enjoyment --eric]
A NEW WORLD RECORD IN PASSWORD CHECKING HAS BEEN SET:
Roch Bourbonnais, a Thinking Machines Corporation engineer, has ported
and optimized the CM/2 port of the UFC-crypt to a CM/5 system.
The UFC-crypt (Ultra Fast Crypt) implementation on the CM/2 Connection
Machine (parallel computer) is a UNIX password checking routine (crypt())
ported by Michael Glad at UNI-C.
The port, that is written in CM-fortran, utilizes the CM/5 vector units
and is partly programmed in cdpeac (vector unit assembly language).
The package achieves 1560 encryptions/second/vector unit. This scales to
    6,4 million encryptions per second on a large  1024 node machine.
    800,000          -       -     -    - - small   128  -      -
With this impressive performance, all combinations of 6 letters can be
tried in less than an hour and all combinations of 6 lower-case letters
can be tried in less than one minute.

This sort of thing happens all the time, actually.  A close friend of
mine was put on an 'employee improvement plan' (the first step to
being fired, actually) because she read/posted to rec.pets.cats.  Upon
closer examination by her grandboss and subsequent review of her
actions before, during and after the plan, it was determined that the
action was taken for political reasons.  (ie: her boss was looking for
a reason to get rid of her because they had a personal conflict).
In other words, if they want to fire you, they'll look for a reason.
I could be fired for sending this message, if someone wanted to push
the issue and my bosses didn't like me.  As it is, they do like me,
and I do a very good job, so the worst that would happen (first
iteration) is an official direction to stop contributing to the
cypherpunks list from my work machine.  (non-work related use of my

Which is why I made the statement about MacScanner.
Access to this sort of technology should not be limited to ham freaks,
private eyes, and followers of the great Radio Shack.
I bought an ICOM R-1 because it does almost everything interesting to
the average person (FM & AM), scans a wide range of stuff, and is
relatively cheap and lightweight.  It's easy to use, modulo tiny
buttons.  It doesn't have all sorts of ham stuff (special SSB mode,
for example).
The R-1 is not 'MacScanner', but it's closer.  It's sort of like
having Windows on a PC.  Once I got it up and running, figured out a
few wierd things, and ignored the rest, I can use it quite easily. :-)
What would be way cool is a handheld scanner with buttons marked:
"Fire", "Emergency", "State Police", "Sheriff", "Police Jury",
"Municipal Police", "Cellular", "Cordless Phone", "FM Radio", "AM
Radio".  It would also be nice to have built in DTMF decoding, blah
blah blah.
And it would really crank up the desire to have crypto phones. :-)

@_subject: job listing, supercomputer systems administration 
Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) has an immediate opening
for two Parallel Systems Analysts to support the Numerical
Aerodynamic Simulation (NAS) Program at NASA Ames Research
Center, including a possible lead analyst position.
The position is for a Systems Analyst in the Parallel
Systems (PS) group of the Computational Services branch.
This group provides support for the NAS parallel systems,
which currently include a 128 node Thinking Machines CM-5, a
128 node Intel iPSC/860, and a 224 node Intel Paragon XP/S.
Other systems may added in late 1993.
While the group is part of a support organization, the
immaturity of parallel supercomputers provides
opportunitities for a significant amount of development
work.  Routine system administration and user assistance is
provided by a separate user services organization, leaving
only the more difficult problems and policy issues to be
resolved by the parallel systems analysts.  Network,
distributed software, and parallel scientific programming
(i.e. FORTRAN) support is also provided by separate groups,
and on-site vendor analysts provide additional assistance.
Current group members are involved in projects ranging from
the development and modification of UNIX tools to kernel
development work, as well as day to day system maintenance
and evaluation tasks.  The parallel systems group also has a
close relationship with the proprietor of the best Indian
restaurant in the known Universe.
The NAS parallel systems operate in a networked (UltraNet,
HiPPI, FDDI, Ethernet) heterogeneous environment that
consists of a Cray Y-MP 8/8256, a Cray C-90, a large mass
storage system, several general purpose support processors,
and over 200 high performance workstations.  UNIX and
UNIX-derivatives are used exclusively.
Located at NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View,
California, the NAS Program is recognized internationally as
a leader in large-scale scientific computing.  Its mission
is to act as the pathfinder in advanced, large-scale
computer system capability through systematic incorporation
of state-of-the- art improvements in computer hardware and
software technologies; provide a national computational
capability, available to NASA, industry, DoD, other
Government agencies, and universities as a necessary element
in ensuring continuing leadership in computational fluid
dynamics and related computational aerospace disciplines.
NAS considers parallel supercomputers to be the future of
supercomputing, and opportunities for a motivated individual
are extensive.
Required Skills:
  o Bachelor's degree in computer science or related field,
    or unrelated bachelor's degree with equivalent
    experience.
  o Fluency with C and at least one UNIX shell, and
    excellent UNIX skills.
  o Experience as a system administrator in a UNIX network
    environment.
  o Good problem-solving and communications skills.
  o Willingness and ability to learn new skills.
  o U.S. Citizenship.
Desired Skills:
  o Experience with parallel computers.
  o Experience with OSF/1, Mach 3.0, or other
    multiprocessor-capable operating systems.
  o Experience in a large scale scientific programming
    environment.

I think that avoiding security avoids the real problem.
Many gov't agencies are swinging away from wide open SMTP in an effort
to find something that has security and authentication.  Having some

 >  >         The cryptography issue is of particular concern to CPSR.
 > During the past several years CPSR has pursued an extensive study of

 > and has emphasized the importance of cryptography for privacy
 > protection and the need to scrutinize carefully government proposals
 > designed to limit the use of this technology.
 >         To evaluate the Clipper proposal it is necessary to look at a

 > emphasized public accountability and stressed open decision-making.
 >         In the spirit of the Act, in 1989 NIST set out to develop a

 > CPSR through the Freedom of Information Act, NIST recommended that the
 > algorithm be "public, unclassified, implementable in both hardware or
 > software, usable by federal Agencies and U.S. based multi-national

(EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE: 3:00 P.M., Friday, Feb. 4, 1994)
                           Fact Sheet
                  NIST Cryptography Activities Escrowed Encryption Standard
On April 16, 1993, the White House announced that the President
approved a directive on "Public Encryption Management."  Among
other items, the President directed the Secretary of Commerce, in
consultation with other appropriate U.S. agencies, to initiate a
process to write standards to facilitate the procurement and use of
encryption devices fitted with key-escrow microcircuits in federal
communications systems that process sensitive but unclassified
information.  In response to the President's directive, on July 30, 1993, the
Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) announced the voluntary Escrowed Encryption
Standard (EES) as a draft Federal Information Processing Standard
(FIPS) for public comment.  The FIPS would enable federal agencies
to procure escrowed encryption technology when it meets their
requirements; the standard is not to be mandatory for either
federal agency or private sector use. During the public review of the draft standard, a group of
independent cryptographers were provided the opportunity to examine
the strength of the classified cryptographic algorithm upon which
the EES is based.  They found that the algorithm provides
significant protection and that it will be 36 years until the cost
of breaking the EES algorithm will be equal to the cost of breaking
the current Data Encryption Standard.  They also found that there
is no significant risk that the algorithm can be broken through a
shortcut method of attack.
Public comments were received by NIST on a wide range of issues
relevant to the EES.  The written comments submitted by interested
parties and other information available to the Department relevant
to this standard were reviewed by NIST.  Nearly all of the comments
received from industry and individuals opposed the adoption of the
standard.   However, many of those comments reflected
misunderstanding or skepticism about the Administration's
statements that the EES would be a voluntary standard.  The
Administration has restated that the EES will be a strictly
voluntary standard available for use as needed to provide more
secure telecommunications.  The standard was found to be
technically sound and to meet federal agency requirements.   NIST
made technical and editorial changes and recommended the standard
for approval by the Secretary of Commerce.  The Secretary now has
approved the EES as a FIPS voluntary standard.
In a separate action, the Attorney General has now announced that
NIST has been selected as one of the two trusted agents who will
safeguard components of the escrowed keys.Digital Signature Standard
In 1991, NIST proposed a draft digital signature standard as a
federal standard for publiccomment.  Comments were received by NIST
on both technical and patent issues.  NIST has reviewed the
technical comments and made appropriate changes to the draft. In order to resolve the patent issues, on June 3, 1993, NIST
proposed a cross-licensing arrangement for a "Digital Signature Algorithm" for which NIST has received a patent application.  The
algorithm forms the basis of the proposed digital signature
standard.  Extensive public comments were received on the
proposed arrangement, many of them negative and indicating the need
for royalty-free availability of the algorithm.   The
Administration has now concluded that a royalty-free
digital signature technique is necessary in order to promote
widespread use of this important information security technique. NIST is continuing negotiations with the aim of obtaining a
digital signature standard with royalty-free use worldwide.  NIST
also will pursue other technical and legal options to attain that
goal.  Cooperation with Industry
During the government's review of cryptographic policies and
regulations, NIST requested assistance from the Computer System
Security and Privacy Advisory Board to obtain public
input on a wide range of cryptographic-related issues, including
the key escrow encryption proposal, legal and Constitutional
issues, social and public policy issues, privacy, vendor and
business perspectives, and users' perspectives.  The Board held
five days of public meetings.  Comments obtained by the Board were
useful during the government's review of these
issues.  In addition, NIST met directly with many industry and
public interest organizations, including those on the Digital
Privacy and Security Working Group and the Electronic
Frontier Foundation.  As directed by the President when the key escrow encryption
initiative was announced, the government continues to be open to
other approaches to key escrowing.  On August 24,
1993, NIST also announced the opportunity to join a Cooperative
Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) to develop secure
software encryption with integrated cryptographic key escrowing
techniques.  Three industry participants have expressed their
interest to NIST in this effort; however, the government still
seeks fuller participation from the commercial software industry. NIST now is announcing an opportunity for industry to join in a
CRADA to develop improved and alternative hardware technologies
that contain key escrow encryption capabilities.
Additionally, the Administration has decided to strengthen NIST's
cryptographic capabilities in order to better meet the needs of
U.S. industry and federal agencies.

Federal Information
Processing Standards Publication 185
1994 February 9 Announcing the
Escrowed Encryption Standard (EES)
Federal Information Processing Standards Publications (FIPS PUBS)
are issued by the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) after approval by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to
Section 111(d) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services
Act of 1949 as amended by the Computer Security Act of 1987, Public
Law 100-235.
Name of Standard:  Escrowed Encryption  Standard (EES).
Category of Standard: Telecommunications Security.
Explanation: This Standard specifies use of a symmetric-key
encryption (and decryption) algorithm (SKIPJACK) and a Law
Enforcement Access Field (LEAF) creation method (one part of a key
escrow system) which provides for decryption of encrypted
telecommunications when interception of the telecommunications is
lawfully authorized.  Both the SKIPJACK algorithm and the LEAF
creation method are to be implemented in electronic devices (e.g.,
very large scale integration chips).  The devices may be
incorporated in security equipment used to encrypt (and decrypt)
sensitive unclassified telecommunications data.  Decryption of
lawfully intercepted telecommunications may be achieved through the
acquisition and use of the LEAF,  the decryption algorithm  and the two escrowed key components. One definition of "escrow" means that something (e.g., a document,
an encryption key)  is "delivered to a third person to be given to
the grantee only upon the fulfillment of a condition" (Webster's
Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary).  The term, "escrow", for
purposes of this standard, is restricted to this dictionary
definition. A key escrow system, for purposes of this standard,  is one that
entrusts the two components comprising  a cryptographic key (e.g.,
a device unique key) to two  key component holders (also called
"escrow agents").  In accordance with the above definition of
"escrow", the key component holders provide the components of a key
to a "grantee" (e.g., a law enforcement official) only upon
fulfillment of the condition that the grantee has properly
demonstrated legal authorization to conduct electronic surveillance
of telecommunications which are encrypted using the specific device
whose device unique key  is being requested.  The key components
obtained through this process are then used by the grantee to
reconstruct the device unique key and obtain the session key  which
is then used to  decrypt the telecommunications that are encrypted
with that session key. The SKIPJACK encryption/decryption algorithm has been approved for
government applications requiring encryption of sensitive but
unclassified data telecommunications as defined herein.  The
specific operations of the SKIPJACK algorithm and the LEAF creation
method are classified and hence are referenced, but not specified,
in this standard.
Data for purposes of this standard includes voice, facsimile and
computer information communicated in a telephone system.  A
telephone system for purposes of this standard is limited to a
system which is circuit switched and operating at data rates of
standard commercial modems over analog voice circuits or which uses
basic-rate ISDN or a similar grade wireless service.
Data that is considered sensitive by a responsible authority should
be encrypted if it is vulnerable to unauthorized disclosure during
telecommunications.  A risk analysis should be performed under the
direction of a responsible authority to determine potential threats
and risks.  The costs of providing encryption using this standard
as well as alternative methods and their respective costs should be
projected.  A responsible authority should then make a decision,
based on the risk and cost analyses, whether or not to use
encryption and then whether or not to use this standard.
Approving Authority:  Secretary of Commerce.
Maintenance Agency: Department of Commerce, National Institute of
Standards and Technology.
Applicability:   This standard is applicable to all Federal
departments and agencies and their contractors under the conditions
specified below.  This standard may be used in designing and
implementing security products and systems, which Federal
departments and agencies use or operate or which are operated for
them under contract.  These products may be used when replacing
Type II and Type III (DES) encryption devices and products owned by
the government and government contractors.  This standard may be used  when the following conditions apply:
     1.  An authorized official or manager responsible for data
security or the security of a computer system decides that
encryption is required and cost justified as per OMB Circular A-
130; and
     2.  The data is not classified according to Executive Order
12356, entitled "National Security Information," or to its
successor orders, or to the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended. However, Federal departments or agencies which use encryption
devices for protecting data that is classified according to either
of these acts may use those devices also for protecting
unclassified data in lieu of this standard. In addition, this standard may be adopted and used by non-Federal
Government organizations.  Such use is encouraged when it provides
the desired security.
Applications: This standard may be used in any unclassified
government and commercial communications.  Use of devices
conforming to this standard is voluntary for unclassified
government applications and for commercial security applications.
Implementations:   The encryption/decryption algorithm and the LEAF
creation method shall be implemented in electronic devices (e.g.,
electronic chip packages) which are protected against unauthorized
entry, modification and reverse engineering.  Implementations which
are tested and validated by NIST will be considered as complying
with this standard.  An electronic device shall be incorporated
into a cryptographic module in accordance with FIPS 140-1.  NIST
will test for conformance with FIPS 140-1.  Conforming
cryptographic modules can then be integrated into security
equipment for sale and use in a security application.  Information
about devices that have been validated,  procedures for testing
equipment for conformance with NIST standards, and information
about approved security equipment are available from  the Computer
Systems Laboratory, NIST, Gaithersburg, MD 20899.
Export Control: Implementations of this standard are subject to
Federal Government export controls as specified in Title 22, Code
of Federal Regulations, Parts 120 through 131 (International
Traffic of Arms Regulations - ITAR).  Exporters of encryption
devices, equipment and technical data are advised to contact the
U.S. Department of State, Office of Defense Trade Controls for more
Patents: Implementations of  this standard may be covered by U.S.
and foreign patents.
Implementation Schedule: This standard becomes effective thirty
days following publication of this FIPS PUB.

Specifications for the
ESCROWED ENCRYPTION STANDARD
1. INTRODUCTION
This publication specifies Escrowed Encryption Standard (EES) functions and parameters.
2. GENERAL
This standard specifies use of the SKIPJACK cryptographic algorithm
and a LEAF Creation Method to be implemented in an approved
electronic device (e.g., a very large scale integration electronic
chip).  The device is contained in a logical cryptographic module
which is then integrated in a  security product for encrypting and
decrypting telecommunications.
Approved implementations may be procured by authorized
organizations for integration into security equipment.  Devices
must be tested and validated by NIST for conformance to this
standard.  Cryptographic modules must be tested and validated by
NIST for conformance to FIPS 140-1. 3.  ALGORITHM SPECIFICATIONS
The specifications of the encryption/decryption algorithm
(SKIPJACK) and LEAF Creation Method 1 (LCM-1) are classified.  The
National Security Agency maintains these classified specifications
and approves the manufacture of devices which implement the
specifications.   NIST tests for conformance of the devices
implementing this standard in cryptographic modules to FIPS 140-1
and FIPS 81. 4.  FUNCTIONS  AND PARAMETERS  4.1   FUNCTIONS
     The following functions, at a minimum, shall be implemented:
     1.  Data Encryption:  A session key (80 bits) shall be used to
encrypt plaintext information in one or more of the following modes
of operation as specified in FIPS 81:  ECB, CBC, OFB (64), CFB (1,
8, 16, 32, 64).
     2.  Data Decryption:   The session key (80 bits) used to
encrypt the data shall be used to decrypt resulting ciphertext to
obtain the data .
     3.  LEAF Creation:  A Family Key (e.g., KF-1) shall be used to
create a Law Enforcement Access Field (LEAF) in accordance with a
LEAF Creation Method (e.g., LCM-1).  The security equipment shall
ensure that the LEAF is transmitted in such a manner that the LEAF
and ciphertext may be decrypted with legal authorization.  No
additional encryption or modification of the LEAF is permitted. 4.2  PARAMETERS
     The following parameters shall be used in performing the
prescribed functions:
     1.  Device Unique Identifier  (UID):  The identifier unique to
a particular device and used by the Key Escrow System.
     2.  Device Unique Key (KU):  The cryptographic key unique to
a particular device and used by the Key Escrow System.
     3.  Cryptographic Protocol Field (CPF):  The field identifying
the registered cryptographic protocol used by a particular
application and used by the Key Escrow System (reserved for future
specification and use).
     4.   Escrow Authenticator (EA):  A binary pattern that is
inserted in the LEAF to ensure that the LEAF is transmitted and
received properly and has not been modified, deleted or replaced in
an unauthorized manner.
     5.  Initialization Vector (IV):  A mode and application
dependent vector of bytes used to initialize, synchronize and
verify the encryption, decryption and key escrow functions.
     6.  Family Key (KF):  The cryptographic key stored in all
devices designated as a family that is used to create a LEAF.
     7.  Session Key (KS):  The cryptographic key used by a device
to encrypt and decrypt data during a session.      8.   Law Enforcement Access Field (LEAF):  The field
containing the encrypted session key and the device identifier and
the escrow authenticator. 5.   IMPLEMENTATION
The Cryptographic Algorithm (i.e., SKIPJACK) and a LEAF Creation
Method (e.g., LCM-1) shall be implemented in an electronic device
(e.g., VLSI chip) which is highly resistant to reverse engineering
(destructive or non-destructive) to obtain or modify the
cryptographic algorithm, the UID, the KF, the KU, the EA, the CPF,
the operational KS, and any other security or Key Escrow System
relevant information.  The device shall be able to be
programmed/personalized (i.e., made unique) after mass production
in such a manner that the UID, KU (or its components), KF (or its
components) and EA fixed pattern can be entered once (and only
once) and maintained without external electrical power. The LEAF and the IV shall be transmitted with the ciphertext.  The
specifics of the protocols used to create and transmit the LEAF,
IV, and encrypted data shall be registered and a CPF assigned.  The
CPF  (and the KF-ID, LCM-ID) shall then be transmitted in
accordance with the registered specifications.
Various devices implementing this standard are anticipated.  The
implementation may vary with the application.  The specific
electric, physical and logical interface will vary with the
implementation.  Each approved, registered implementation shall
have an unclassified electrical, physical and logical interface
specification sufficient for an equipment manufacturer to
understand the general requirements for using the device.  Some of
the requirements may be classified and therefore would not be
specified in the unclassified interface specification.  The device Unique Key shall be composed of two components (each a
minimum of 80 bits long) and each component shall be independently
generated and stored by an escrow agent.  The session key used to
encrypt transmitted information shall be the same as the session
key used to decrypt received information in a two-way simultaneous
communication.  The Lead Creation Method (LCM), the Cryptographic
Protocol Field (CPF), and the Family Key Identifier (KF-ID) shall
be registered in the NIST Computer Security Object Register.  This standard is not an interoperability standard.  It does not
provide sufficient information to design and implement a security
device or equipment.  Other specifications and standards will be
required to assure interoperability of EES devices in various
applications.  Specifications of a particular EES device must be
obtained from the manufacturer.
The specifications for the SKIPJACK algorithm are contained in the
R21 Informal Technical Report entitled "SKIPJACK" (S), R21-TECH-
044-91, May 21, 1991.  The specifications for LEAF Creation Method
1 are contained in the R21 Informal Technical Report entitled "Law
Enforcement Access Field for the Key Escrow Microcircuit" (S).  Organizations holding an appropriate security clearance and
entering into a Memorandum of Agreement with the National Security
Agency regarding implementation of the standard will be provided
access to the classified specifications.   Inquiries may be made
regarding the Technical Reports and this program to Director,
National Security Agency, Fort George G. Meade, MD 20755-6000,
