I _still_ have a running UUCP node (on a MickeySoft box, at that).  Given that UUCP was designed to run arbitrary programs on remote hosts and route their output, it seems to me this is an ideal transport mechanism.

Interesting to note that the same type tax applies to "music CD-R" blanks (of the type required by the Phillips-Magnavox style music CD burners, which won't burn onto a data blank).  Last I looked, such blanks were still >$1.00, where data CD-R blanks are down to ~$0.39.  And, of course, computer-based burners have no problem burning audio onto a data CD-R.
Where they doubtless stay.  It's pretty well known how little artists make from their corp-owned recorded works.
