I'm one from "Frenn vun der Enn" a Torservers.net partner organisation.
If you run a Tor exit on your own server (which you use for other stuff)
it won't take long to get yourself blacklisted.
We recommend to put the node on another server or to change your exit
node to a relay or bridge.
TOR DNS Blacklist. Just wondered if anyone else running a node had any
issues with email while running a relay node on the same server?
hope you don’t mind me asking.
