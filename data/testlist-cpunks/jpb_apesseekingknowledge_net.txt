It's becoming easier for the public, though.  Apple's new Mac OS X 10.3 includes S/MIME built into the mailer.  No more watching their eyes glaze over as I explain to my friends that they first have to install GPG, then find a plugin for their mail program, then try to teach them to create & send people keys.
I prefer the GPG model of relying on people I actually trust to certify a key belongs to who it claims to belong to than relying on a corporation, but at least this will start people thinking about securing their mail.
