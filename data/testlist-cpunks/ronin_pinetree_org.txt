@_subject: Need telnet access 
Hi there.  This is Doug - I'm subscribed to the list as dsinclai at acs.ucalgary.ca.  Unfortuantely, though my account is in Calgary, I'm flesh in Ottawa.  I also just lost my telnet access as a local switch upped its security.  Is anyone out there in a position to lend a fellow cypherpunk a hand and get me a telnet account in Ottawa?  It would be much appreciated.  Please reply to this account.  Thanks.
