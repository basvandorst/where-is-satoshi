OK, I'm game. What is the story behind your .sig? Given the obvious reluctance state it fully, perhaps someone else can reply?

Belize is a shit hole that is as willing as many other slimeball countries to deny someone entry and force them kicking and screaming onto the next flight to the U.S. on request from U.S. authorities. In principle, that is kidnaping. They use the technicality that the person never entered their territory. No- man's lands of port zones where the most basic rights may be violated without regard to a country's constitution are another class of abuse that will have to go.
Belize is also the place where Bob White, publisher of The Duck Book and sponsor of some of the largest hard-money conferences ever held, was murdered.  The usual suspects were not even rounded up.
Someone once wrote that the principle cash crop of Belize is lice. In reality it may be principles. At least the Hondurans got angry when a citizen was kidnaped by the U.S.
