More foolish speculation on Tim's part, as well as a shoddy attempt to associate my eloquent missives with the mad ramblings
of Detweiler.
  As for Tim's grandoise claims of my having an "unatural fixation,"
on him, my stalking of him and my use of binoculars and electronic
devices to monitor him have proven well worthwhile in helping to gain the information needed to expose him for what he is (although I
am afraid I cannot share this information with anyone without violating
the confidential integrity of the stalker-victim relationship.)   An "unnatural fixation" is revealed by more personal and sick,
twisted habits, such as Bill Stewart using his Eudora software
to filter Toto's posts to a special directory he projects onto
an overhead screen during his sexual orgies with farm animals.
(Pictures to follow...)
  I am astounded that Bill as much as admitted so on the list,
much as I was astounded when Tim announced that he would be
murdering Jim Bell's judge on Friday, at 4 p.m.
