Something fun to fret about: the robot itself is a tiny little thing,
barely larger than a US cent.
What they did not mention is that you could outfit one of these little
robots with some kind of poison dart, bringing us much closer to our
hunter-seeker than I had anticipated.  We are basically there now, assuming
these things aren't too noisy.
