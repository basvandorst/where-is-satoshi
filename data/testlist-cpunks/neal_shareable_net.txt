@_subject: [P2P-F] Would you like to write about how to set up a mesh network 
Hi p2p friends,
We at Shareable are looking for someone to write a how-to article about
how to set up a neighborhood mesh network so neighbors can share
Internet access.
Please contact me if you're interested or know someone who
could do a good job at it.  What's especially appreciated is someone who
has actually set one up or knows someone who has that can be a source.
The article would add to our library of around 80 how-to share guides
including how to start a housing coop, a chicken coop, hold a
free market, share a vegetable garden, start a farmers market and more:
