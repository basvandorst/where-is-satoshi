This organ-incubator needs to read the constitution.  Satan is an angel;

BILL BARS SEX SITES AT LIBRARY

Surfing for smut at local libraries would be barred under a bill set to
heard by Beacon Hill lawmakers today.
The measure, sponsored by Republican House leader Francis Marini, would
block Internet access to "satanic cults," "indecent depictions of bodily
functions" and "illicit drugs, alcohol or tobacco products."
