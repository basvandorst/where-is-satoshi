You will need to verify these facts.
I believe that the InfoSleuth project was the code name for InfoGlide a
data-mining startup currently located in the mcc building. They create advanced databases for fraud prevention and law enforcement
applications. Call David Wheeler, founder of the company to verify the InfoSleuth connection

@_subject: 3DES weak because DES falls to brute-force? (was Re: John Gilmore...) 
Are we talking long-term archival?  I'm more concerned about someone
grabbing communications in transit, storing them and throwing chips and
mathematicians at it.
If the government comes with the search warrant, then I should have already
deleted the file if I didn't want it available.  If someone wants to face
security guards or a gun by my bedside they can steal the archive.  It's
the same rules as always. (except the theif must also have the math and
In the case of archive you have the protection of physical security and in
most cases the knowledge of when it has been breached -- It's a lot
friendlier than in communications where who knows what is going on between
the sender and recipient.
OTP is a pain, and is not effective for archival -- but it is the only way
I've seen to protect communications in excess of ~30 years.

@_subject: Finally... a One-Time-Pad implementation that works!!! 
I wish there were more details.  Namely how they generate their 10^30 byte
"virtual keystream".
In order to be a true one-time pad the keystream needs to be completely
random, this looks more like a psuedo-random stream cypher to me.  But it
should be fast and still might be secure.  As a competing one-time pad vendor I don't want to be a pot calling the
kettle black, but If I've learned anything from the cypherpunks, it's prove
it.  Which is what we've tried to do.
