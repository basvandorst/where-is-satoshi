Interesting question.  I would answer this question for you but then I would have to kill That is basically like asking a car thief to tell yuo about how he breaks into cars and what cars hes broken into lately.
My suggestion to you is to pick up one of those MEGA lame books like "What is a Cyberpunk!" and read that.  It may not tell you shit, but it will give you a broad understanding about what you want to know.
