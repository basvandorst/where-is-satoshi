I'd like to nominate Don Listwin for the first 'Flaming Idiot of the Month'
award,  since he has not fucking clue what he is talking about.
Suffice it to say,  most all of us are in favor of things like anonymous
remailers and devices on the net to protect anonymous activities and
keep us free from the clutches of big brother.  Unfortunately,  I happen
to work for a company who's vice president of marketing likes to hear
his fucking gums flap and who doesn't have enough of a brain to match his
oratory complex.
Little does he know that cisco's already been infiltrated by avid cypherpunks,
cypherpunk friends,  and proto-cypherpunks (before John's first meeting).
Sigh... anyone got a deal on some lead pipe suitable of embedding in the
empty skull of a certain suit?

  Would you care to provide us some background info about Mr. Listwin so
  we can decypher this?  :)
Since a couple of people have asked me why I was ragging on Don Listwin,
here's the original message that brought it to this forum:

The first meeting was at my house, and organized by myself and Tim
May.  A correction would be welcome.

I stand corrected.
