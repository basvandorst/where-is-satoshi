HEADLINE: The Camera Never Blinks, but It Multiplies
BYLINE: By HENRY FOUNTAIN
    IT'S spring, and a new crop of police surveillance cameras is
sprouting in
cities big and small. New York is installing 500 on street corners;
Chicago is
upgrading several thousand; and even the city of Dillingham, Alaska,
has 80 --
one for every 30 residents.
      Many of these newer cameras can pan, tilt and zoom, and are
through the Internet, so video images can be viewed and stored
centrally. They
are often purchased with homeland security funds, meant for use against
terrorism as well as street crime.
     But it is impossible for a police department to continuously
monitor 2,000,
500 or even, in the case of Dillingham, 80 cameras. So other than
mountains of visual data -- and raising the inevitable questions of
privacy --
how useful are they?
      Law enforcement officials argue that just putting up a camera
in plain
sight can deter crime. And some see a future in which software will
video for possible signs of terrorist activity, like someone placing
a suitcase
in front of a building.
      ''We have seen significant dividends as a result of
implementing this
program,'' said Andrew Velasquez III, director of the Office of
Management and Communications in Chicago. Drug trafficking has been
reduced in
areas where cameras have been installed, he said. And the city is
starting a
pilot program to see whether automated analysis can be effective.
      But some security experts say the cameras are of limited value
