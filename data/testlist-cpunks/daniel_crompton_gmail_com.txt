References: As the text looked like a riddle my first guess was that it was a clue to
"just count" which to me sounded like a Caeser or Vigenère cipher with the
date being the key and the quote the obfuscated address. Giving the factors
for generating the keys does sound more logical.
born on January 31 1979 .. all prime numbers .. I would sit on the floor in
my bedroom and just count.
