Dear Sir,
I would like to introduce myself to you. I am a free-lancer and working fo collecting  stock apparels from alll nation wide. And then I try to export to other country now.
I am asking you that I want to enter into business with you for the mutual benefit.
Because, I could buy cheap price with good quality and you could make good merit of
benefit for those goods.
Also alll stock goods should be pay by cash but L/C basis is no problem to settle up for
payment matter.
If you agree, We could try to find above goods for every weekly or monthly basis when you need. If you are interesting of my proposal, please give us your reply by returm e-mail asap.
We am looking forward to hearing from you soon. We remain in the meantime.
