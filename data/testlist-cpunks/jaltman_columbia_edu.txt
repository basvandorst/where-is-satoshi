I don't understand this last paragraph at all.  If you put a proxy on
amazon.hackeddomain.com and I connect through the proxy to the real
amazon.com, where is the threat?  If the SSL connection is established
with the proxy, then the X.509 certificate on that host does not match
 and the connection would not verify.  If the connection
is proxied to the real  the SSL connection will verify,
and because it is protected end to end the proxy will not be able to
do anything other than disconnect the connection at an arbitrary
time.  There is no man in the middle attack here.

No he can't.  What hackeddomain.com is sending is the certificate for hackeddomain.com which does not contain the host name Therefore, it won't be accepted by the client.
If hackeddomain.com acts as a proxy, then the certificate that is
received by the client is the real one from  and so the
session is protected.  You can't have it both ways.
