Mr. Hughes, I was myself subject to `rude and unwelcome and annoying
behavior' -- a mini mail bomb, which I attempted to shame the sender
into refraining from in reporting it to the mailing list as a whole.
You explicitly condone such atrocious behavior in your outrageous
response to myself and my postmaster.
