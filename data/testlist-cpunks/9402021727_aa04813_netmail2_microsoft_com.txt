@_subject: Canadian gov't eavesdropping 
Eli Brandt   sent the the following to cypherpunks:
VERY feasible.  The US government has had this technology for several
years; the Canadians are just catching up.  In the late 80s the US
military launched a satellite to spy on the Russians.  The satellite was
programmed to scan radio transmissions - especially cellular phones -
searching for key words which might be related to military or government
activities.  It seems a few communist party members got a little too
confortable with their cellular phones in their limosuines, and spoke
very loosely about some secret government projects...
They have mentioned this in the series "Space Age" which airs
periodically on PBS.
