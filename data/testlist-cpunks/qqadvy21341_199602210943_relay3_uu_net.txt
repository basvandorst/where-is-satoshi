to unsubscribe from the cypherpunks mailing list, send to:
an e-mail message with the following text in the body of the message:
buenas suerte, nemesis.
p.s. -- a little hint: if your mail reader lets you save messages rec'd in folders or some such thing, you should save all the messages you get from mailing list software (like the first two messages you got from cypherpunks) in a sepaprate folder (like one called 'lists'.) Then you will be able to go back and unsubscribe or sign off when you want.
I'm thinking of putting the how to unsubscribe info for RFC-Dist and IETF-Announce (and maybe c.punks) in a .sig file - but I hate sigs so.
