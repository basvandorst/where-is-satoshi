had an accident two years back that was during my last
year in the university.I thank God to that am alive to
testify to the wonderful things that the lord have
been doing in my live.Today i am an accountant,but the
unfortunate situation there is that i lost my right
limb due to the accident that i had.this  condition
has made life immensely difficult for me,this have
made me to seek for your much needed
help.Please,kindly help me as i cant work and i need
to buy a[plastic Right Limb]and a wheel chair  to
enable me to move freely from one place to ther other.
