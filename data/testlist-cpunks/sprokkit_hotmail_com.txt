@_subject: anonymous mailboxes 
Some time ago I heard about Lucky Green's then-immature scheme for anonymous email boxes, whereby a user can receive email and even a traffic analysis attacker is unable to glean information about who received what when.  I forget exactly what ve called vis method...
   Is there a paper available anyplace?
   Has the scheme been validated mathematically?
   Has it been implemented?
