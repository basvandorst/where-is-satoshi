@_subject: Chaffing & winnowing without overhead 
You can have chaffing & winnowing without bandwidth overhead, but the
resulting scheme hasn't the original "elegance" anymore. In particular,
you don't send the plaintext on the clear.
The new schema is useful to cypher a document using any standard
signature library, exportable by definition. Very nice :), since you can
use, at last, strong crypto :).
a) When the connection starts, negociate an initial sequence number.
   The sequence number mustn't be reused. We assume a ordered delivery,
   like TCP.
b) Calculate the signature for:
   [sequence]0  ->  MAC0
   and
   [sequence]1  ->  MAC1
c) Compare both MACs and locate the first "different" bit,
   from high to low bit or viceversa.
d) Send that bit from MAC0 if you want to send a "0" or from
   MAC1 if you want to send a "1".

Yes, you are right, Mordechai. My point was:
a) Prove that you can implement chaffing & winnowing without
   bandwidth overhead. I agree that the final schema doesn't
   resemble C&W anymore :).
b) Prove that you can use signature schemes, strong and exportable,
   to achieve confidentiality. In that way, my objetive is the same
   that Rivest had.
I'm happy knowing I can use full strengh signatures to keep my secrets,
secret :)
In the Rivest's paper you transmit, indeed, all the 2^n plaintexts for a
n bit length };-).
