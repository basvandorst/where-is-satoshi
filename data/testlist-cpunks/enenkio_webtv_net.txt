The Kingdom of EnenKio
- Economic Citizenship Program -Â 
EnenKio is an English-speaking sovereign independent nation in the North
Pacific Ocean. As such, it is not a well-known economic and financial
sanctuary, but with the prospect of attracting qualified professionals
in every field of endeavor, it has a growing international financial
General Considerations
The Government of EnenKio operates an Economic Citizenship Program
(ECP), which allows the grant of citizenship to individuals of good
character who make a significant contribution to the growth and economy
of EnenKio. This is aimed at stimulating inward investment and
harnessing managerial and entrepreneurial skills to help the country's
development. EnenKio law provides the fundamental basis for the
operation of the ECP. This was made possible through the EnenKio
In 1995, the EnenKio Development Act was passed into law to provide as
"The establishment of citizenship in the Kingdom shall be by mutual
consent. The possession of citizenship in any other jurisdiction shall
not prejudice establishment of citizenship in the Kingdom, provided that
any pronouncement of allegiance required by any other nation, shall not
be in conflict with any required citizens of the Kingdom."
See: Legal Opinion Qualifying factors
Every Applicant is a qualified citizen if:
- born unto a parent who is, prior to birth, a citizen; or,
- born within any jurisdiction of the Kingdom; or,
- a citizen or resident of the Marshall Islands; or,
- a person of Marshallese ancestry; or
- married to a citizen, or one qualified as a citizen.
Other Applicants for citizenship are invited to apply and shall qualify
to become a naturalized citizen if they:
- have attained an age of five (5) years; and,
- submit a completed passport application; and,
- successfully pass security and proof of identity checks; and,
- enclose 4 color photographs, one signed on right side margin; and,
- have proffered allegiance to the Kingdom by signing oath; and,
- have been accepted as a member of Kio Royale and remain such in good
standing; or,
- receive a grant of citizenship on economic, hardship or other valid
government program.
Any applicant who is becomes eligible or is granted citizenship under
the ECP shall be entitled to receive benefits that pertain to the
particular option(s) selected. Certain Applicants, by reason of
political affiliation, business activity, professional exploits,
occupational achievements or other personal history, having become
ineligible for citizenship in the country of origin thereby, may become
eligible under a special administrative amnesty policy and would be
evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Passports and other documents issued
under the ECP generally have limited terms, but may be converted to
regular permanent terms after two years. A committee within the EnenKio
Ministry of Foreign Affairs carefully screens prospective applicants for
ECP options.
Program Options
Kio Royale Membership Â Active members of this private independent
service-oriented advocacy group support the efforts of the government of
EnenKio in its mission to assist persons of Marshallese ancestry to
regain occupation and jurisdiction over the lands and seas of Eneen-Kio
Atoll and protect their natural rights to self-determination. There are
4 categories of membership with Initiation fees ranging from $500 to
$10,000. An active service requirement term applies to 3 categories.
Annual dues range from $50 to $100. Benefits include Membership
certificate, eligibility of single or family citizenship grant,
Diplomatic Service Corps certificate and waiver of Active Service
Requirement term. Payment can be accepted in equivalent amount of any
internationally traded currency. Application Form Credit Trust Account Â Individuals of good character who want to make
a loan to the government of EnenKio may contact the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs. Loans can be made in any internationally traded currency, in
precious metals or another agreed form.Â  Some restrictions pertaining
to jurisdiction of lender's origin or domicile may apply.Â  Such
restrictions and domain considerations are the sole responsibility of a
lender to verify legality of any EnenKio loan, barter or payment
Land Lease Program Â Individuals of good character who desire orÂ 
intend to establish, settle or maintain a residence in the North Pacific
Islands may do so by becoming a leaseholder with interests in the
Northern Ratak atolls under ascendancy of His Majesty King Remios of the
Kingdom of EnenKio. Upon execution of such a lease, application fees for
EnenKio citizenship are waived. The government of EnenKio will sponsor
leaseholders (as EnenKio citizens) to apply for an Immigration Visa from
the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI). Meeting RMI requirements for
residency and otherwise will lead to Marshall Islands citizenship. By
this process individuals or families can gain full citizenship and gain
the right to work or do business in EnenKio and the Marshall Islands.
Amnesty Program Â This program is reserved for individuals and
families who have become "stateless" refugees and are without
citizenship elsewhere. Provisions are generally the same as those of the
Kio Royale or Credit Trust Account program, but entail a waiver of the
active service requirement. In this way, refugees or stateless persons
of good character may be obtain permanent citizenship immediately.
Active Service Requirement (ASR)
When an "active service requirement" term applies, it affords the
parties an opportunity to verify the terms of the relationship in lieu
of the residency requirement commonly imposed by other states. Islands
of Eneen-Kio Atoll are currently being held under force of arms by
occupation forces of the United States, so residency there is not
possible. For those wanting to physically relocate to the islands, the
Land Lease Program is your best alternative. The current ASR term in
effect is 24 months. What this means is that your passport will look
like a regular EnenKio passport, but will have an expiration date of
approximately 2 years after issuance. Within 2 months of expiration, ASR
passport holders will need to re-apply for "permanent resident" status.
Upon approval, a regular 5-year passport will be issued.
Reasons to acquire a second citizenship
to establish a legal domicileÂ 
to protect assets and income from oppressive taxation, creditors,
judgments or litigation.
to simplify travel to countries restricted under current citizenship.
to avoid persecution on religious, ethnic or political grounds.
to immigrate to a democratic peace-loving country such as EnenKio.
to find a stable country where substantial investments can be made.
Multi-national policy
EnenKio recognizes multi-national citizenship so individuals who benefit
under this program can retain their original citizenship if needed.
Individuals approved under this program enjoy all rights, privileges and
diplomatic protection as bona fide citizens of the Kingdom of EnenKio.
How to apply under the Economic Citizenship Program
Applicants choose an option and contact a consulate or the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs central office. Any amounts to be paid or loaned to the
government are made payable to the Kingdom of EnenKio in any
internationally traded currency equivalent to the US dollar amounts
published. In addition, fees may be payable to licensed and bonded
immigration consultants who will accept applications and submit them to
EnenKio Ministry of Foreign Affairs for processing on behalf of the
Reasons you may consider a second passport
Political instability in your country of origin makes travel on your
current passport difficult.
Your assets are vulnerable to loss, attachment or litigation.
You and your business are overburdened by taxation.
Your basic human right to travel is restricted.
You are not allowed to work or settle in another country.
Your life or business is threatened by your country's political or
economic situation.
Your religious or political beliefs are subject to persecution.
There are no Registration or Investment Fees. The payment of monies
represents payment for membership, consideration under contract,
document application processing, handling costs or fiscal loan amounts.
These amounts represent an applicant's commitment to the Kingdom of
EnenKio. Grant of citizenship represents the Kingdom of EnenKio's
commitment to an applicant.
All monies are paid directly to the Kingdom of EnenKio. Any fees to
cover costs of processing, legal charges and consulting is negotiated
with and payable to the Immigration Consultant if employed. Applications
under this program may be made through a licensed Immigration Consultant
or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Applicants do not need to visit or
reside in EnenKio. They can be sworn in at any EnenKio Delegation or
Consular office found in many parts of the world including the Americas,
Europe and the Middle East.
EnenKio offers significant advantages over other programs offered by
other countries:
it is a small independent state with His Majesty King Remios as its head
of state, who is the ancestral head of about one-third of the atolls of
the Marshall Islands.Â 
the government is still small and is building new trading partners all
over the world.Â 
citizens can access certain unique financial trust services
enjoy a tax-free status for personal and business ventures
have the flexibility and dependability of a friendly political system
founded on principles similar to those of the original framers of the
constitution of the United States of America and Bill of Rights.
the islands are unspoiled, warm, pristine and blessed with normally
perfect weather.
every citizen can play a part in the development of the political,
social and economic order.
EnenKio has no outstanding unsatisfied obligations.

CALL- 808 923-0476 FAX/PH or E-Mail mp at enenkio.orgÂ  Facts = : : Spook Master for Inouye and Akaka- Allen P Stayman. "AL-GATE" By
Charles P. Reyes Jr. SAIPAN, Northern Mariana Islands (August 18, 1999
Â Saipan Tribune)---John Del Rosario called it "The Pinto Boys
Plumbers Unit." Bruce Lloyd called it "Al-Gate." We could also call it
"North-Gate." But whatever it is called, it is clearly one of the
biggest scandals to hit Washington since the Monica Lewinsky affair.
Such a scandal merits much more mainland American media publicity than
it is currently receiving--and not just from the Wall Street Journal,
the Washington Times and the Washington Post, but from the Reader's
Digest, Inside Edition and 20/20 as well. Most especially from 20/20,
since it was celebrated for its award-winning CNMI sweatshop/forced
prostitution exposÃ©. After all, wouldn't 20/20 like to know how they
served as willing dupes to David North, Global Exchange and other
co-conspirators bent on discrediting the CNMI and its free market
Republican allies? ABC's 20/20 should really produce this investigative
story. ABC's Brian Ross owes it to professional, fair-minded, ethical
journalism. Here is how such a show might go. Connie Chung: Good
evening, America. And welcome to 20/20. A few months ago, we produced a
special report called "The Shame of Saipan," detailing false charges of
sweatshops and prostitution on "American soil." Well, today we would
like to set the record straight and apologize for serving as the willing
dupes of Mr. David North, formerly of the U.S. Interior Department, who
flagrantly violated the Hatch Act in a shameless attempt to discredit
Saipan and its Republican allies. Charles Gibson: That's right, Connie.
There is compelling and convincing evidence to suggest that the U.S.
Department of Interior, Office of Insular Affairs, under the auspices of
Secretary Bruce Babbitt, former Director Allen Stayman and David North,
waged a vicious campaign of political destruction against a tiny set of
islands its office was specifically created to nurture, support and
protect. Our reporter Brian Ross has more . . . Brian? Brian Ross:
That's absolutely right, Charles. The U.S. Office of Insular Affairs
clearly violated the Hatch Act through the direct actions Mr. North and
possibly even Mr. Stayman. To this day, however, Mr. North still refuses
to comment on the matter, as this video clip clearly shows. (Episode now
switches to an ominous camera shot of Mr. North's House. Mr. North
leaves his house and Brian Ross peppers him with questions.) Brian Ross:
Mr. North, did you really violate the Hatch Act, and were you really out
to destroy Tom Delay? Mr. North: (Covering his head and waving Mr. Ross
away): No comment. No comment. I have no comment at this time. Please go
away. Brian Ross: Which was why we sent an undercover Republican posing
as a Democrat from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee to
speak to Mr. North prior to the scandal. It is all here on tape, and
it's worse than the undercover buyer speaking to garment magnate Willie
Tan. (Move to undercover film clip.) Undercover Republican (posing as a
Democratic labor union supporter): Mr. North, what are we going to do
about the CNMI? Mr. North: Don't worry, George Miller will never let
them go. He will kill them. I am working on getting more Democrats to
help George kill the CNMI and their evil Republican friends right now.
Yes, this story ought to be produced; unfortunately, it will never
happen--nothing even close. STAYMAN THE SCOUNDREL By Benhur C. Saladores
SAIPAN, Northern Mariana Islands (August 19, 1999 Â Saipan
Tribune)---We have a new name for Mr. Allen Stayman. From now on, Mr.
Stayman will be known as "Stayman the scoundrel" in the Northern
Marianas. This is not mere name-calling, since a scoundrel is officially
defined as "a mean, worthless fellow; a rascal; a villain; a man without
honor or virtue." Such a description fits Mr. Stayman's character
perfectly. Consider the memo he wrote to Matt Angle, a former executive
director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC),
suggesting that U.S. Democrats "repudiate" former Governor Froilan C.
Tenorio. "Largely out of sight, there is a nominal Democrat, a Governor
running for reelection, who scorns our President, who is in Washington
this week playing footsie with the Republican House leadership, and who
should be repudiated -- in writing -- by the Nation's Democrats," wrote
Stayman the Scoundrel in an October 6, 1997 memo, according to Roll
Call. According to the Saipan Tribune, "Stayman further suggested that
the Democratic National Committee 'should repudiate these scoundrels.'"
Exactly who are 'these scoundrels' Mr. Stayman refers to? Froilan
Tenorio, of course--but not only the former governor: all of the
indigenous people as well. That is, all of the indigenous people who
refuse to be subjected to Mr. Scoundrel's program of federalization; who
refuse to be deprived of their local self-government and economic
self-sufficiency; who refuse to tolerate the lies Mr. Stayman, Mr. North
and their labor union cronies tell about our home islands. Mr. Stayman
is a scoundrel because he calls people who disagree with his politics
"scoundrels," because his radical leftist ideology clouds his
objectivity and drives him to violate federal laws (the Hatch Act) with
impunity. Stayman is a bureaucratic federal bully who was out to destroy
the CNMI's reputation and anybody who defends it. Mr. Scoundrel was out
to destroy our garment industry and ravage our economy--just to serve
his politics. He knew about David North's vicious campaign to unseat
U.S. House Republicans all along--and yet he did absolutely nothing
about it, probably because he was deeply involved in the anti-CNMI
crusade himself. Mr. Stayman is a scoundrel--"a mean, worthless fellow;
a rascal; a villain; a man without honor or virtue." That much is a fact

Desk/Environmental Reporter July 12, 2000 Inspector General Testifies
About Illegal Political & Lobbying Activity At Department Of Interior
"Most Egregious Example I've Seen" In 30 Years Of Law Enforcement
Washington, D.C. - The Inspector General for the U.S. Department of the
Interior today outlined numerous examples of illegal political and
lobbying activity at the Department which led him to refer the matter
for possible criminal prosecution against an agency employee. Earl E.
Devaney, Inspector General for the Department of the Interior, testified
before the U.S. House Committee on Resources that former Interior
official David North's political activities were "the most egregious
example I've seen" in 30 years of law enforcement. North "retired" last
year immediately after the Resources Committee began an investigation
into North's political activities. Devaney testified that North
conducted political activity from his federal office during work hours
against Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-TX), Majority Whip Tom DeLay
(R-TX), and U.S. Reps. Phil English (R-PA), Brian Bilbray (R-CA) and
Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA). In addition, Devaney testified that North
sought to assist Democrat Congressional candidates and had contact with
the Democrat National Committee and the Democrat Congressional Campaign
Committee. Clinton's Department Of Justice Refuses To Prosecute Case
Inspector General Devaney also stated that he was disappointed that the
Department of Justice declined to prosecute North for criminal actions.
U.S. Rep. Don Young (R-Alaska), the Chairman of the Committee, responded
that he wasn't surprised "considering the Clinton-Gore Administration's
well-documented manipulation of the Justice Department to protect
illegal activity by its political appointees." "This is the most
partisan and politically-motivated Justice Department in the history of
the nation," Young said. Another Clinton Political Appointee Is Under
Investigation By Government Devaney also explained to the Committee that
Allen Stayman, the former Director of the Office of Insular Affairs, was
under investigation by the Office of Special Counsel for possible
illegal political and lobbying activities. Devaney said his
investigation uncovered evidence that Stayman was aware of some of
North's political and lobbying activities. The Resources Committee is
also investigating actions by Ferdinand "Danny" Aranza, the current
Director of the Office of Insular Affairs. Both Aranza and Stayman
testified under oath at today's hearing under subpoena. "I've never
high-ranking officials suffer such convenient memory lapses in my 27
years in Congress," Young said. "Despite the denials and all of the
'I-can't-recalls', we will continue to pursue to this issue." Inspector
General Devaney also testified that North assisted organizations like
the Global Survival Network and helped prepare a "report" that
questioned connections between Members of Congress and garment
executives. The organization later submitted the report to Congress.
Devaney also testified that North provided confidential information
about private individuals to a reporter. Chairman Young's Opening
Statement "After a year-long oversight review, this Committee has
unearthed overwhelming documentation of numerous highly unethical and
improper actions by federal employees of the Office of Insular Affairs,
or OIA. "We have been able to substantiate multiple acts of partisan
political activity, lobbying with appropriated funds, producing
materials and collecting information under false pretenses, and
violations of the privacy of individuals and businesses - all courtesy
of the U.S. taxpayer. "In short, we have found massive waste, fraud, and
abuse at the Office of Insular Affairs. This is what Congressional
oversight is supposed to be all about. "OIA's highly questionable
activities, at taxpayer expense, include: researching and writing
political campaign press releases and candidate position papers for
candidates to present as campaign materials; researching and drafting
partisan memos and press releases for Democratic party offices,
including the Democratic National Committee, the Democratic National
Congressional Committee, The House Democratic Caucus, and state party
organizations, to present as their own campaign materials; editing,
researching and writing reports, position papers, and press releases for
lobbying organizations to use to influence the outcome of legislation
before Congress; hiring private investigators to nose around Saipan and
even Hong Kong to dig up information on the garment industry; digging up
private, sensitive information about private citizens they don't like,
and then releasing that information - full names, Social Security
numbers, Alien registration information - to investigative journalists.
The Committee has subpoenaed and reviewed the contents of hundreds of
thousands of documents, as well as the contents of six agency computers
and dozens of computer diskettes. At the same time as these materials
were being provided to the Committee, the Department was also providing
them to the Interior Department Inspector General, Earl Devaney.
Interior's own documents show that one purpose of this referral was the
hope that an ongoing IG investigation might be a successful excuse to
stop producing materials to the Committee. In fact, this excuse was
attempted. It did not work then, and it will not work now. This
Committee must not - and will not - turn its back on its duty to oversee
that activities of officials at the Interior Department - particularly
when there are specific and credible allegations they are using the
resources authorized by this Committee, for partisan and inappropriate
purposes. Nevertheless, I'm sure you will hear the same old song and
dance from the Democrat minority: this has been a witch-hunt, this is
partisan, there is an active criminal investigation, so we should just
drop it. We've seen this defense tactic used so many times from the
Minority in this Administration, and in this Committee, that it amazes
even me. But let me remind the Democrats that if it weren't for the
inquiry being conducted by this Committee, there would be no criminal
investigation anywhere. It was only after - and as a direct result of -
the opening of this inquiry and the issuance of the initial subpoenas,
that the Interior Department forwarded the information to the Office of
Special Counsel and the Inspector General. At each step of the inquiry,
as this Committee has gathered more information from the Administration,
they have had to forward it also to the Inspector General and the OSC.
That is how Mr. Devaney learned about the abuses going on at OIA. So now
we will hear from the Inspector General, a career law enforcement
professional, and a Clinton Appointee. Mr. Devaney delivered a copy of
his final report to the Committee on Monday, and appears to have found
the same level of waste, fraud, and abuse at OIA that the Committee has
found. So, unless you believe in a grand conspiracy involving the
Congress and the entire office of the IG appointed by Clinton, this is
not a partisan witch hunt. This is about doing our job: protecting the
taxpayer, protecting privacy, protecting against waste, fraud, and
abuse. You'll also hear from my friends in the Democrat minority that
the improper activities were only carried out by one rogue operator,
David North, and that he's now off the payroll, so let's just drop it.
But Mr. North's "retirement" doesn't absolve this Committee of its duty
to get to the bottom of things, and to find out who else may have been
involved. That's why we're here today, and that's why we have subpoenaed
Mr. North's two superiors, former OIA Director Allen Stayman, and former
Deputy Director Danny Aranza, the current Director. They had the duty to
monitor what Mr. North was up to. Lastly - and most loudly - you'll hear
from the Democrats that what was going on in the garment industry in the
CNMI1 was so bad that it justified what North and others were up to. Let
me be clear: This hearing is NOT about allegations of worker abuse on
the CNMI. We have had a CODEL2 to the CNMI, and we have held a hearing
on the CNMI, but THIS hearing is about abuses in the OIA, which this
Committee has a duty to oversee. And we will NOT be de-railed. If
federal officials are allowed to break any laws they want, to violate
people's rights, just because they believe their cause is just, then
Katie bar the door. The message to all federal employees would be that
constitutional and statutory rights don't matter, as long as big brother
in the government thinks the cause is just. If the Democrat minority
gets its way, then who gets to draw the line? What would my colleagues
say if it was a Republican Administration abusing people's privacy and
conducting partisan political activity, because they thought the cause
was just? If the Minority thinks what went on here was OK, and that we
should just ignore the partisan activity and the lobbying and the
privacy violations, then they should go on the record and say so. Then
the next Administration, and the American people, will know where they
stand." 1. CNMI - Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands. 2. CODEL -

- Present Status -
EnenKio is a sovereign state
The government of the Kingdom of EnenKio was established in 1994 under
authority and by direction of Head of State and the hereditary
Iroijlaplap (Paramount Chief) of the Northern Ratak atolls of the
Marshall Islands. The Constitution of EnenKio established and set forth
the authority and responsibility of the government and established
duties and succession protocol of the Monarch and Royal Family.?
EnenKio is a Limited Constitutional Monarchy.? Representative
citizens, acting as Founding Fathers, ratified the Constitution,
recognized His Majesty King Murjel Hermios as Head of State, affirmed
their resolve in the Declaration of Sovereignty and determined the
boundaries of the new Kingdom of EnenKio.?
Notice that EnenKio was a new sovereign state was sent to
representatives of the Republic of the Marshall islands, United States,
United Nations General Assembly, UN Security Council, South Pacific
Commission, NATO, world media, Pacific Island nations and other
nations.? Legal action was then taken to set forth the claim against
the foreign occupational forces of the United States, which failed to
ever answer any actions and now stands in default with respect to
demands for compensation and for illegally occupying of the king's
ancestral lands.? The effect of legal demands filed in U.S. federal
court, unanswered complaints and failure to reply now have the force of
law in commerce, under national and international laws and conventions.
EnenKio is an "offshore haven for criminals and money launderers"
Actually, the United States did reply ? not directly to EnenKio, but
with an insidious merciless campaign of disinformation broadly dispersed
across the Internet and to its trading partners.? One glaring example
is a U.S. Department of State Report which compares EnenKio to the likes
of Thailand, Colombia and Russia under the topic of "Money Laundering
and Financial Crimes".? This official report ? International
Narcotics Control Strategy, 1998 ? categorizes EnenKio as an Offshore
Financial Center.? This is a curious label as EnenKio has no bank, no
financial center and no money to launder.? It goes on to refer to
another state and "Enenkio" (sic) as "...mere figments of fertile
imaginations...", and as "...entirely fraudulent in intent and
practice."? The United States offers NO proof nor is it known to have
ever found any.? In fact, in February 2001, the Securities & Exchange
Commission, together with other federal agencies of the United States,
concluded an exhaustive investigation that failed to turn up even one
shred (or hanging chad) of evidence of impropriety ? in intent or
EnenKio exists "only in cyberspace"
Such a claim might be made for Yahoo?, Windows Magazine? or any
number of "dot.coms".? Why, the United States itself claims over
25,000 web sites hosting millions of pages.? Is this not a criteria
for existence in cyberspace?? EnenKio as a state has its roots in a
1987 document, but really, it is founded upon more than 2000 years of
historical lineage preceding the ascendancy of the Hermios Marshallese
family to their rightful, recognized traditional post.? The EnenKio
web site did not appear until 1998.? It is a mystery how any
reasonable person could examine the few dozens of posted documents, laws
and letters ? thousands of pages are not posted ? and then say:
EnenKio exists only in cyberspace.
Today's Challenge for Tomorrow's Future
Every avenue is being explored to raise capital for projects described
in the development plan. Bond, stamp and shipbuilding programs have
commenced.? Applications are invited for passports, business licenses
and ship registration.? For those qualified individuals who wish to
join this effort or encourage us to gain recognition among states of the
first order, we have a need for Consuls and Diplomatic representatives
in foreign offices, Trade Missions and other diplomatic posts.
Additional human resources and people knowledgeable in international
policy, diplomatic protocol, spaceport and aircraft operations,
telecommunications, shipping, manufacturing, chemical engineering and a
host of other disciplines will be required to design and attract
development projects and implement envisioned programs.? Contractual
arrangements for professional consultation and services in law, finance,
commerce, economics and others are being actively sought.
All who have an interest and are so moved, you are encouraged to submit
a Personal Involvement form.? By submitting the form, you will be
advised of the latest developments, provided an outline of needs and may
at some point be invited to actively participate in development and
promotion of EnenKio and to become a citizen of the fledgling nation.
On behalf of the Second Monarch, His Majesty King Remios Hermios, His
Royal Highness Crown Prince Lobadreo Hermios and all representatives and
citizens of EnenKio, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sincerely
acknowledges your involvement, interest, prayers and support.

@_subject: Thair back !!! SuperJap Sen.Inouye (one armed bandit) and SPOOKs 
"AL-GATE" By Charles P. Reyes Jr. SAIPAN, Northern Mariana Islands
(August 18, 1999 ? Saipan Tribune)---John Del Rosario called it "The
Pinto Boys Plumbers Unit." Bruce Lloyd called it "Al-Gate." We could
also call it "North-Gate." But whatever it is called, it is clearly one
of the biggest scandals to hit Washington since the Monica Lewinsky
affair. Such a scandal merits much more mainland American media
publicity than it is currently receiving--and not just from the Wall
Street Journal, the Washington Times and the Washington Post, but from
the Reader's Digest, Inside Edition and 20/20 as well. Most especially
from 20/20, since it was celebrated for its award-winning CNMI
sweatshop/forced prostitution exposÃ©. After all, wouldn't 20/20 like
to know how they served as willing dupes to David North, Global Exchange
and other co-conspirators bent on discrediting the CNMI and its free
market Republican allies? ABC's 20/20 should really produce this
investigative story. ABC's Brian Ross owes it to professional,
fair-minded, ethical journalism. Here is how such a show might go.
Connie Chung: Good evening, America. And welcome to 20/20. A few months
ago, we produced a special report called "The Shame of Saipan,"
detailing false charges of sweatshops and prostitution on "American
soil." Well, today we would like to set the record straight and
apologize for serving as the willing dupes of Mr. David North, formerly
of the U.S. Interior Department, who flagrantly violated the Hatch Act
in a shameless attempt to discredit Saipan and its Republican allies.
Charles Gibson: That's right, Connie. There is compelling and convincing
evidence to suggest that the U.S. Department of Interior, Office of
Insular Affairs, under the auspices of Secretary Bruce Babbitt, former
Director Allen Stayman and David North, waged a vicious campaign of
political destruction against a tiny set of islands its office was
specifically created to nurture, support and protect. Our reporter Brian
Ross has more . . . Brian? Brian Ross: That's absolutely right, Charles.
The U.S. Office of Insular Affairs clearly violated the Hatch Act
through the direct actions Mr. North and possibly even Mr. Stayman. To
this day, however, Mr. North still refuses to comment on the matter, as
this video clip clearly shows. (Episode now switches to an ominous
camera shot of Mr. North's House. Mr. North leaves his house and Brian
Ross peppers him with questions.) Brian Ross: Mr. North, did you really
violate the Hatch Act, and were you really out to destroy Tom Delay? Mr.
North: (Covering his head and waving Mr. Ross away): No comment. No
comment. I have no comment at this time. Please go away. Brian Ross:
Which was why we sent an undercover Republican posing as a Democrat from
the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee to speak to Mr. North
prior to the scandal. It is all here on tape, and it's worse than the
undercover buyer speaking to garment magnate Willie Tan. (Move to
undercover film clip.) Undercover Republican (posing as a Democratic
labor union supporter): Mr. North, what are we going to do about the
CNMI? Mr. North: Don't worry, George Miller will never let them go. He
will kill them. I am working on getting more Democrats to help George
kill the CNMI and their evil Republican friends right now. Yes, this
story ought to be produced; unfortunately, it will never happen--nothing
even close. STAYMAN THE SCOUNDREL By Benhur C. Saladores SAIPAN,
Northern Mariana Islands (August 19, 1999 ? Saipan Tribune)---We have
a new name for Mr. Allen Stayman. From now on, Mr. Stayman will be known
as "Stayman the scoundrel" in the Northern Marianas. This is not mere
name-calling, since a scoundrel is officially defined as "a mean,
worthless fellow; a rascal; a villain; a man without honor or virtue."
Such a description fits Mr. Stayman's character perfectly. Consider the
memo he wrote to Matt Angle, a former executive director of the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), suggesting that U.S.
Democrats "repudiate" former Governor Froilan C. Tenorio. "Largely out
of sight, there is a nominal Democrat, a Governor running for
reelection, who scorns our President, who is in Washington this week
playing footsie with the Republican House leadership, and who should be
repudiated -- in writing -- by the Nation's Democrats," wrote Stayman
the Scoundrel in an October 6, 1997 memo, according to Roll Call.
According to the Saipan Tribune, "Stayman further suggested that the
Democratic National Committee 'should repudiate these scoundrels.'"
Exactly who are 'these scoundrels' Mr. Stayman refers to? Froilan
Tenorio, of course--but not only the former governor: all of the
indigenous people as well. That is, all of the indigenous people who
refuse to be subjected to Mr. Scoundrel's program of federalization; who
refuse to be deprived of their local self-government and economic
self-sufficiency; who refuse to tolerate the lies Mr. Stayman, Mr. North
and their labor union cronies tell about our home islands. Mr. Stayman
is a scoundrel because he calls people who disagree with his politics
"scoundrels," because his radical leftist ideology clouds his
objectivity and drives him to violate federal laws (the Hatch Act) with
impunity. Stayman is a bureaucratic federal bully who was out to destroy
the CNMI's reputation and anybody who defends it. Mr. Scoundrel was out
to destroy our garment industry and ravage our economy--just to serve
his politics. He knew about David North's vicious campaign to unseat
U.S. House Republicans all along--and yet he did absolutely nothing
about it, probably because he was deeply involved in the anti-CNMI
crusade himself. Mr. Stayman is a scoundrel--"a mean, worthless fellow;
a rascal; a villain; a man without honor or virtue." That much is a fact

Background Summary
The government of the Kingdom of EnenKio was instituted under a
Constitution giving titular duties and recognition as Monarch to His
Majesty, King Murjel Hermios, a native Marshallese Paramount Chief
(Iroijlaplap) who, by right of descendancy, traditional matriarchal
tenure and ancestral heritage, is owner in allodium of the islands at
Eneen-Kio Atoll. As a limited constitutional monarchy, the government
was first formed by the King, who by appointment, established the office
of Minister Plenipotentiary. King Murjel passed away in December 1998;
his brother Remios became Second Monarch of the Kingdom. King Remios'
brother, HRH Lobadreo Hermios, is Crown Prince.
The tiny atoll has a remarkable history of having played a very
significant role in the religious and social life of the Marshallese
natives who first began to inhabit the area as early as 500 BCE. Due to
the isolation and relative obscurity of the flat sand and coral islands,
finding the atoll presented a distinct challenge to native sailors, who
navigated the open sea using small charts of sticks and shells and
simple dugout sailing canoes. Some, reportedly selected for human
sacrifice to native gods, would find the huge sea birds, unaccustomed to
humans, easy prey at Eneen-Kio Atoll. A wing bone could be substituted
for one's own bones, destined to be used as a "needle" in tattooing
ceremonies. The demonstration of bravery in completing the journey was
sufficient to spare their lives. Sailors returning from the atoll would
proudly display proof positive of their success: a small orange (Kio)
flower, unknown to grow elsewhere in Micronesia at the time. This same
delicate flower (Sida fallax), commonly called Ilima, is scattered
throughout the Hawaiian Islands of today and is used in lei-making and
decorative arts.Â 
Today, the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll are occupied by the agents and
workers of the federal government of the United States, which unlawfully
seized the property during the colonial expansion era of the
Spanish-American War, circa 1899. Efforts to convey an understanding of
the King's right and title to the land and to promote cooperation
between the leadership of the two nations are continuing.
The precedent for the return of the islands was set by the 1993 U.S.
apology (PL103-150, 107 STAT 1513) for the illegal overthrow of the
Hawaiian Monarchy and by the 1994 return of the island of Kaho'olawe to
Hawaiians are considered paramount to the demands being made in the case
of Eneen-Kio Atoll.
General Considerations
The three islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll are far from any classic image of
tropical paradise. Foliage is scant, the land is low and fresh water is
in short supply. The challenge of setting up and maintaining habitation
and human activity there is lessened somewhat by advances in technology.
The use of alternative and renewable energy and environmental systems
offer several convenient solutions for the reliable power and water
needs of residents.
Centrally located in the North Pacific Ocean, triangulated between
Hawaii, Japan and Australia, albeit remote, the atoll offers a unique
set of circumstances worth special consideration. Aside from the
presence of military-styled infrastructure, water and power station and
a substantially superior airstrip to any in the region, little else is
known to be there as would befit commercial and community development.
Numerous improvements are needed to support the planned activity.
This presentation is intended to conceptually introduce the reader to
potential uses, programs and development opportunities envisioned for
the Kingdom of EnenKio.
Also see: National Liberation Program
Government Trust Services
The foundations of government are supported by the pillars of freedom,
equality and respect for the traditions of past generations of native
Pacific islanders. Application of these ideals guide the design,
selection and implementation of methods and programs to induce a maximum
benefit for and to residents and citizens of Eneen-Kio Atoll, without
regard to where they may actually reside or from what place their roots
Liberal considerations complimentary to the inherent rights of
individuals are made with respect to citizenship, licenses, ship
registry, personal and professional documentation, trust and financial
services and other areas normally encumbered with restrictive controls
and governmental influence. For that reason, all areas within the
jurisdiction of the EnenKio government are declared to be a
Free-Enterprise Zone.
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS
Given that considerations for factors stated above are requisite to
fully understand, appreciate and utilize the opportunities for commerce,
trade, travel, finance and business in and of the Kingdom, the following
are set forth below in capsule form:
Commercial Broadcasting - A powerful radio wave transmitting facility on
par with "Radio Free Europe" could reach audiences from Alaska to New
Zealand, China to Mexico and provide programming now unavailable.
Voice & Data Links - Satellite and ground relay of communications from
all island groups in the North and South Pacific Ocean. Worldwide
cellular telephone service is planned. It will be dependent upon
spaceport development, efficient and economical satellites in orbit.
Fiber Optic Relay Station - Communication link between Eastern Asia and
Hawaii, which has access to North America, would provide service for
large-bit data transmission through superior fiber optic network, also
expandable to link island groups in the South and West to main trunk
line. Spaceport Operations
Satellite Launch Facility - The proposed Spaceport to be located in the
Big Island of Hawaii was to take advantage of geographic considerations
for certain types of launches seems to be terminally stalled over
hazards to and objections of the population. Eneen-Kio Atoll has none of
the issues that are causing seemingly insurmountable problems in Hawaii.
Yet Eneen-Kio Atoll still has the advantage of geographic location,
major airstrip and freedom from the numerous restrictions imposed by
U.S. federal agencies and associated policies.
The importation requirements are still valid, being 2000 miles from the
U.S., and exportation of waste and toxic residue could be eliminated by
local processing facilities, planned regardless of spaceport plans.
Other limitations imposed by native archeological sites, thermal and
wind flow effects, weather and cloud effects from mountains, increases
in moisture from rain and rocky coastline (ocean spray), scientific
observation equipment atop Mauna Kea and need for permits or land
acquisition are essentially eliminated.
Weather Data/Observation - Coupled with the need for timely pre-launch
weather data, observations with atmospheric instrumentation and balloons
will capable of being conducted on a regular basis.
Telemetry Support - Coupled with the need for post-launch telemetry, the
facilities will be available to support space programs of other nations.
Given the establishment of communications links with Hawaii, much of the
support may be supplied from Hawaii.
Toxic/Nuclear Waste Disposal Program - Coupled with the spaceport
operation, permanent disposal and remediation programs for a variety of
products, whether produced locally or outside of Eneen-Kio Atoll, are
needed and contemplated. Several of these processes are proprietary and
beyond the scope of this presentation. While the air terminal on Wake Island is potential refuge for commercial
Transpacific aircraft on an emergency basis, it is not now open for air
routes and interisland flights. Upon site development and requisites of
other programs, a need for increased services shall be met with
appropriate measures. The present air strip is nearly 2 miles in length.
Geographic position of Eneen-Kio Atoll plays an considerable role in the
development and support of North Pacific fishing fleets. Vessel supply
and repair services, cannery operation, fish processing facilities and
air shipment of fresh catch products to the East or West are to be
Financial Services & Banking Center
The prevailing political climate in support of individual freedoms,
including rights of privacy and security in personal affairs and lawful
business dealings, shall combine with other factors to create a climate
of expanding commerce and financial independence. In general, services
shall include electronic bank transactions, insurance, precious metals
refinery and depository, central bank and secure trust haven.
Implementation will be augmented by the communications links and
expanding gross national product.Â 
See also: The Banking Act of 1995. Mineral Exploration, Natural Resource Recovery & Processing
Very little with respect to recoverable natural resources is known about
much of the area proximal to Eneen-Kio Atoll. Nearby seamounts and
mineral beds are potentially a vast natural resource awaiting
technologically refined methods of discovery and retrieval. Coring will
be necessary to assess the presence and character of minerals.
Maritime Services
Policies and procedures are in place to promote national security,
encourage domestic and foreign commerce and to ensure safety of vessels
of the Kingdom and other maritime nations of the world.
Ship Enrollment and Maritime Service Documentation - EnenKio will be a
host nation for documentation and enrollment of sailors and their ships.
All enrolled vessels shall be accorded privileges, which may be
unavailable to vessels of highly regulated nations.
Ship Supply and Service Facility - A necessary component for any diverse
maritime industry will be adequate ship services. Primarily designed to
handle vessels of fishing fleets, other transpacific, international and
pleasure craft shall have ready access to the services and facilities at
Eneen-Kio Atoll.Â 
See also: The Maritime Act of 1995. Citizen Fidelity & Investment
Individuals wishing to further the causes and development programs of
the Kingdom by affiliation or involvement may make application for
citizenship and travel documents or for consular representative
assignment. Participation in the government's development programs shall
be considered on a per case basis, but generally will not be
unreasonably denied to persons of sincere intent. Economic and personal
advantages to natural and artificial citizens of EnenKio may be found in
understanding licensing laws, financial and trust services and in
finding freedom from taxation.
Citizenship - Belief in and support of the concepts of individual rights
and freedoms that were the founding precepts of the United States of
America in the latter part of the 18th Century shall be required of any
applicant. The purpose of government shall be to ensure those rights and
freedoms are not violated under the Constitution of EnenKio. MORE on
Travel - Citizens of EnenKio, without regard to ethnic or national
origin, shall have the right to travel freely while outside the
territorial boundaries of EnenKio. Travel documents, including passport,
will be issued and acceptance by other nations will be the goal of
ensuring our citizens of their freedom of movement while in foreign
Diplomatic Service - Citizens who are willing to promote the programs of
EnenKio and are desirous of consular status while in foreign lands shall
be considered upon application on a per case basis, in accordance with
Foreign Service Corps and Ministry policies.
Investment - Acceptance of support and funds for advancement of
development programs shall give participants priority in obtaining
necessary government affiliation services. Programs of national identity
and international commerce will benefit from dedicated citizen
involvement. A legal defense fund will be instituted to perfect and
assert claims. Â Â Â  Â 
MORE on the Economic Citizenship Program
Waste Remediation
Radioactive waste - Permanent disposal via proprietary methods will
eliminate materials producing ionizing radiation, without substantial
risk of contaminating and polluting of any place on Earth or elsewhere.
Toxic and chemical waste - On site via proprietary methods as above.
