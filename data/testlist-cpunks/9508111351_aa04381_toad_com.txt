@_subject: IPSEC goes to RFC 
Don Eastlake has actually done a draft RFC on
using the DNS for key distribution.
It may be found at He briefed the W3C security working group about
this recently, and a number of people raised objections, notably
* database bloat
* zone transfer bloat
* increased hits on root servers due to a new class of inquiry.
There was some discussion as to whether these were valid objections,
and the people running prototype code said they had had no problems.
