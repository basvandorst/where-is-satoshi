Would you be in favor of charging someone for possessing things like:
- A catalog of hacking tools;
- Pedophile instruction manual;
- Recipes for preparing human flesh;
Things like that remember me that google once did not have the capacity to exclude links from its systems, but because of pedophiles, they finally built that capacity. The next day the copyright industry was knocking at their door to take down content they previously couldn't because of the lack of technical capacity.
"Now Google don't have excuses." - I remember seeing that phrase in a New York magazine.
The only way to not have people charged because of a book would be to make legal all books no matter what and you guessed it right, it won't happen.
Because you, yourself, will be in favor of indicting people in at least one of the items I quoted, which automatically makes it legal to charge anyone because of possession of any book.
