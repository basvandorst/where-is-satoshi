FWIW some people that hang around Telecomix might also be interested in collaboration on stuff outside of just regular Byzantium. I also know that there are some people doing space stuff that we can reach out to, via the DARPA funding for hackerspaces and Space. I think that Byzantium is a very cool subproject that loops into a whole slew of mesh networking projects that can build an ecosystem of communication gear that can be put together in a hurry. I think that the community might be reaching critical mass where we start to integrate all this stuff. As an aside, it blew my mind that for $20k you could build a blue force/situational awareness system for a 20 kilometer radius using mesh networking. Byzantium should really look at integrating serval-maps project, as it can do some really cool stuff with mapping. Andrew

Jacob, The people I have talked to claim to be from the tech side of intelligence agencies, and indicated a disorganized mess with competing fiefdoms. All my other poking and proding internally point to a ton of different and random equipment across different ISPs. However I have no info or access to the demarc at this point, so I'll take what your saying as the truth, I am merely indicating that my sources are not just average joes as far as I know and is based on my own investigations into the matter. Yes mobiles are terribly weak from a security PoV. And since this is where most of the Internet and communication penetration is at in these countries, it is even scarier.

And it looks like I maybe wrong. It seems that torrents, and videos
stopped working sometime yesterday. I am going to do some more
digging. Tor, and some specific types of VPNs still seem to be working
