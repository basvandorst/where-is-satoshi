Quite true.  All you really need for a fission bomb is a casing to hold everything together, 2.2 kilos (or so) of U-235 (or a sufficient quantity of critical mass other stuff ), and something that will hold it together long enough for it to fission.
And no, Taylor, holding them together in your hands won't work (unfortunately)... hehehe :)

Exotic way to commit suicide, methinks.  Kiddies, don't try this at home - leave this to the professional idiots... ;)
Kinda reminds me of Congress... ;)
