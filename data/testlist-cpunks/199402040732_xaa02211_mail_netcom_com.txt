@_subject: Remailer FAQ. Details. 
I hope I can get a bit more attention to this, now that it has become more
sophisticated. Please code warriers, take a break and let the human race
know what the existing remailers are all about. I know exactly why they
don't have enough traffic; knowledge about them is still insider
knowledge. A list of remailer addresses and year-old partial info from a
request made my Tim May was all I could find. Specs needed.
I will send this to Gary Edstrom for the PGP FAQ if I don't have to spend
the rest of my life compiling it. Mail info to qwerty at netcom.com. I'm
interested in hearing from users as well as operators. -Nik (Xenon)
