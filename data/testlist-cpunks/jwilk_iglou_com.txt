As the youngest Cypherpunk in the world (or at least i am aware of) I think
a little reply is in order from my self. Thats what those old records are for. (no offense)
        If they are sueing MTV why not other TV stations....
        If I was going to sue someone for not doing my homework i would sue
Jarkko Oikarinen, the creator of IRC. I just think that this is really
        pathetic.... but then again I am famous for my flame replys in the past.
        Why not make the school pay MTV for keeping kids away from there station
        while they are doing homework (hehehe)
        FYI i thought this reply out.

Timothy, For the first time in my life I agree with you. I am 13 and the cop here a

catch the bastard who kill people, not on the kids who just like to take a

What if in the future a country banned the internet and all things that had
to deal with it (ie-  telnet, irc). It would be  the "underground" thing.
Just a thought, it would really suck! As I think about it it is impossible
or is it???? Hell the usa cant even ban porn let alone the whole thing. They
could ban it like they did fizzies. Hey there making a comeback did you here
now they have nutrasweet in them. If you know what fizzies are than your
pretty kewl. I'm only 13 and love then they are the drink of the future!!!!

@_subject: Senator Exon & me 
I am not one to lash out at anyone but now I feel it is appropite to tell
the group what our very own Senator Exon has said to myself. If you do not
care then delete this e-mail but if you would like to hear what a senator
said to a 13 year old then read on. I will not put on the whole letter just the parts that I deem inapropite. I'm not flaming you. You might not even get flamed this time. But you will be.
This is just the kind of message which I hate. It is a waste of my time and
a waste of time for people who have a lot less time than I. Please wait for
a legitimate reason to post. I might patronize your age but I won't - I was a
13-year-old net kid once.
 If you really wanted to show just had balls (I hate to use the phrase but
I can't think of anything better) you wouldn't hide behide remailers.
I don't want to be around the first time you send your girlfriend(s)
e-mail. I predict an ass-kicking of MAJOR proportion.
 This is kinda an inside joke
I really hate to waste your people times with my messages but aren't we all
on this mailing list to learn? I'm 13 hell, I bet there are people on the
list that are 5 times as old as me. I want to say that I really wanted to
talk to Senator Exon on an IRC channel but I can't seem to mail him due to
his cowerdness. I want to apologize to everyone that I may have said some
things things that were wrong in the past but I'm learning and hope to have
a great job in the computer indusrty (if there really are any). i will close saying that it was wrong that someone would creatique a 13 year
old's signatrure. I feel that is wrong but hell, I guess I just to young to
be a cyberkid. Thank you for hearing me out. :-)
Ps if you want the full letter e-mail me and i'll sent it to you.

Florida Supreme Court Home Page Adorned With Porn
TALLAHASSEE, Fla (Reuter) - A Florida court's Web page was restored Friday
after two days'
absence following a break-in by a hacker who placed pornographic images on
the site. Court officials Wednesday took the state court system home page off-line
after a computer hacker
apparently broke into the site and added pictures of nude men and women in
various stages of
sexual activity. The photos caused a stir among those who use the court page to access
Florida Supreme Court and
Appellate Court decisions. The home page is normally a little more staid,
with a plain wood-grained
background and hypertext links. Prurient, but disappointed, surfers looking for thrills on the net gave the
court system home page one
of its busiest days ever Friday. "We've had a significant number of hits today on our home page," said Craig
Waters, executive
assistant to Florida Supreme Court Chief Justice Gerald Kogan. "With all the
publicity surrounding
this, a lot of people are curious." No files were tampered with and court records remained intact, Waters said.
The Florida
Department of Law Enforcement was contacted and was investigating the break in. Court officials intend to prosecute the perpetrator, Waters said.
