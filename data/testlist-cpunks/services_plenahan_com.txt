@_subject: Hello 
Hi, I was wondering if you market products/services
using your computer and would like to learn how to
do so QUITE a bit better than what you are already doing?
Is so, just say the words (words=MORE ORDERS) and I'll email a
free, helpful file about our program! This program is so good
that could mean the online marketing difference between
scintillating success and frustrating failure.
