@_subject: UHS encoding 
has anyone heard of UHS ? ? its universal hint system . . its for game hints
. . its data files are encrypted and a decoder decodes only the hints you
need . . anyone know what encryption is used ? ? its probably very weak but
a good idea . . i wonder if this is export - restricted too ! !
