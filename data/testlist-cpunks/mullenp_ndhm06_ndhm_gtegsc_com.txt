Note: I changed the list to Cypherpunks, since this is more relative to
that list.
Crack, the UN*X /etc/passwd cracker comes with a very large dictionary.
assume you want one for the same purpose (maybe not...).  I can't
for sure, but I believe it is a plain ASCII file.  Go to webcrawler and
"crack and unix" (w/out quotes) and you'll find a listing.  A site named
BTW, this is a DOS application, *not* UN*X...

How do you implement this feature?  Where is the time/date information
stored?  Is this in that header you were talking about before?  Is there
some method which is designed to thwart simply changing the CMOS ~ Patrick

@_subject: Rejection policy of the Cypherpunks maiing list 
Igor sez:
I question this, too.  What, exactly, is the criterion?
Cypherpunks charter sez:
The cypherpunks list is a forum for discussing personal defenses for
privacy in the digital domain.   How does personal
through forged and anonymous mail not fit this topic?
However, I _do_ have to say such a topic would have to keep with a descriptive attitude, rather than demonstrative...  :-)
On another note, even though some messages which may be of interest may
get lost in the shuffle, I do like the reduced volume, esp. since I get
at work.  Unfortunately, the reduced mail is a result of censorship...

Cryptography, in particular public-key cryptography, has emerged in the
las 20 years as an important discipline that is not only the subject of
enormous amount of research, but provides the foundation for information
security in many applications.  Standards are emerging to meet the
for cryptographic protection in most areas of data communications.
key cryptographic techniques are now in widespread use in industry, especially in the financial services industry, in the public sector, and
individuals for their personal privacy, such as in electronic mail.
This Handbook will serve as a valuable reference for the novice as well as
the expert who needs a wider scope of coverage within the aread of
cryptography.  It is a necessary and timely guide for professionals who
practice the art of cryptography.
The _Handbook_of_Applied_Cryptography_ provides a treatment that is multifunctional:
* It serves as an introduction to the more practical aspects of
  both conventional and public-key cryptography
* It is a valuable source of the latest techniques and algorithms
  for the serious practitioner
* It provides an integrated treatment of the field, whil still
  presenting each major topic as a self-contained unit
* It provides a mathematical treatment to accompany   practical discussions
* It contains enough abstractoin to be a valuable reference for
  theoreticians while containing enough detail to actually allow
  implementation of the algorithms discussed
This is the definitive cryptography reference that novice as well as
developers, designers, researchers, engineers, computer scientists, and
mathematicials alike will find indispensable.

Is there a way we can keep the caricatures w/out getting the rest of the
w/ these postings?  I like the ASCII art, but...
BTW, I don't know if the joke was in the original posting (I notice the
RE: header),
but --

Whales are mammals.
