@_subject: Building crypto archives worldwide to foil US-built Berlin Walls (fwd) 
I don't see why you have to pose such severe selection criteria.
As long as a number of countries don't yet have export regulations,
one can have a number of archive sites in each one of these
countries, in so far as the financial problem is solved. We aren't
choosing a single central archive that should be up for eternity.
If the 'economies', 'infrastructure' 'religon' and what not of the countries do not (yet) affect crypto laws, why care about them? If at a later point of time some of these countries do have crypto laws, well, simply close down the archive there and let the sites in the remaining countries take over the downloading demands of the
closed down sites. Isn't that simple?
Much more important is to discuss how to solve the finacial problem
of setting up such archives, to have people maintaining them,
the technical problem of storage and the general policy of storage,
I believe.
