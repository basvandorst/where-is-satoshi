     I run a small mailing list that has been subject to problems
similar to the recent spate of "unscrives".  Apparently there is a
list of mailing lists circulating the warez boards along with scripts
for spoofing subscription requests.  Over the past few months my list
has periodically received batches of bogus subscriptions for accounts
ranging from Fidonet sysops to Al Gore to random AOL users.  Email
from other mailing list admins indicates that these same accounts,
perhaps two hundred in all, were subscribed to several hundred lists.
     Crypto relevance:  This attack will be eliminated when more mail
agents support public key crypto and the mailing list software can be
modified to check signatures on subscription requests.

     Mr. May and others have addressed the government's abuse of
Microsoft eloquently and well.  It is clear that the DOJ is well out
of constitutional bounds with this litigation.  It is equally clear
that the real problem with Microsoft is that its poorly designed,
bloated, _inelegant_ software is pervasive.
     The solution to both of these problems lies in David Honig's

The President should issue an executive order mandating that all
government agencies immediately remove all Microsoft operating systems
from their machines, to be replaced with Linux.  All Microsoft
products should be eliminated as well.  The standard text format
should be LaTeX.  All businesses receiving money from government
contracts should be required to use the same tools.
     This would cut down dramatically on the money spent on software
by the government, eliminate compatibility problems between users of
different versions of Microsoft products, encourage enormous growth in
the Linux software market, and guarantee that Microsoft would never
again be considered a monopoly.  All this without ever entering a

     Okay, so I'm a UNIX-head; I forgot about the Macs (a dangerous
thing to do, given the ferocity of their supporters).  If the
government were to adopt my suggestion, two major results would be:
     - The third party market for Linux software would grow rapidly
       and enormously.
     - The government's software budget would be reduced dramatically.
I consider both of these to be Good Things (tm).  The government
wouldn't be forcing anything at the point of a gun, they'd simply be
making a financially responsible vendor selection (hey, there's a
first time for everything).  Our tax dollars shouldn't be wasted on
substandard software when superior, cheaper alternatives exist.

     I can provide a pentium box running Linux with a T1 connection to

     There are two forms of atheism (visit alt.atheism.moderated for
an unending discussion).  "Strong" atheists state that they "believe
that god does not exist."  "Weak" atheists state that they "do not
believe that god exists."  The first is a faith based positive
assertion, analogous to "god exists".  The second makes no assertion
and hence has no associated burden of proof.  Given the lack of
evidence for the existence of a god, it is the default, logical
     Do you believe in leprechauns, because there is no proof that
they don't exist?  Do you believe in the Hindu pantheon?

     Without reason and logic, how do you propose to prove these
assertions?  Reason and logic don't "constrain", they provide a
framework for discovery.  This framework is unavailable to, and indeed
actively rejected by, believers in the supernatural.  Any meaningful
definition of the word "inquiry" presupposes the use of logic.

     All faith-based assertions are by definition irrational.  Mystics
frequently speak of transcendence as if the word denotes a concept
with a particular meaning, but never provide a coherent definition.

     Personal philosophies are a superset of personal religious
beliefs.  Personal philosophies that include the concept of a god are
clearly religious in nature.  Personal philosophies that include the
concept of "faith" are probably religious in nature.  Personal
philosophies that include the concepts of empirical evidence,
sceptical inquiry, and willingness to reject previously held positions
due to new evidence or argument are probably not religious in nature.
     The reason I challenged your assertion is that religious people
often use such statements as a basis for further arguments that end up
equivocating based on the term religion.  They first broaden the
definition, by fiat, to be almost meaningless and then later use a
much narrower definition to support their ultimate point.  I'm not
suggesting that you were going to do this; I am simply pointing out
why it is something of a sore point.

     No, they are not.  The distinction is crucial to the main point I
evidently failed to make in my previous message:  Atheism is not a set
of beliefs that constitutes a personal philosophy.  There are Buddhist
atheists, Universalist-Unitarian atheists, objectivist atheists,
Wiccan atheists, etc.  Atheism isn't even a belief, it is merely the
statement of a lack of one particular belief.
     Getting back to the strong v. weak distinction, the weak atheist
position that one "does not believe god(s) exist" does not constitute
a belief, a set of beliefs, or a personal philosophy, let alone a
religion.  The strong atheist position that one "believes god(s) do
not exist" is actually making a knowledge claim and so does constitute
a belief.  Recognizing that someone holds the strong atheist position
may give some clues to their other beliefs and the remainder of their
personal philosophy, but, again, that position alone does not
constitute a personal philosophy or religion.

     I'm not trying to prove anything either.  I'm simply pointing out

     Now this part of the discussion I entered to satisfy my own
curiosity.  Since it is so far off-topic for this list I'd be glad to
take it to personal email if you wish.  When you say "more than the
earthly veil" do you mean that there exist phenomena that cannot, even
in principle, be detected by our five senses or by any physical

>     agreed, the strong v. weak atheist argument is _impossible_.      I'll try one last time and then let this grossly off-topic thread
continue without me.
     The weak atheist position is a _lack_ of belief.  No knowledge
claim is made.  This position can come from a number of perspectives,
one common one being that the concept denoted by the word "god" is
incoherent.  If a concept is without meaning then it doesn't make
sense to claim to believe that it doesn't exist; such a claim would
itself be incoherent.
     The strong atheist position that god(s) do not exist does
constitute a knowledge claim.  It implies that the holder of the
position associates a particular, meaningful concept with the word
"god".  It doesn't, however, indicate anything about the other beliefs
of the atheist in question.
     There must be some 'net law regarding the effort required to make
a point being inversely proportional to the complexity and importance

     That makes two rude replies in a row in response to polite
messages.  I'll give anyone the benefit of one bad hair day, but
further discussion with you is obviously a waste of time.  I do thank
you for demonstrating that "transcendence" is not a null concept,
however.  You are without a doubt a transcendent asshole.
     I retire from this discussion and yield the floor to you,
Mr. Choate.  It is only fitting, seeing as you've gone to such trouble
to deposit that large pile of fecal matter in the middle of it.

[ standard Nigerian bank transfer scam elided ]
     For those of you who enjoy learning the details of these scams:
          The basic idea is to get the gullible to send the scam artist details
of their bank accounts.  A variation involves requiring the payment of
"documentation fees" before the money can be transfered.
