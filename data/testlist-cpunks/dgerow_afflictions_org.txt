(I'll admit it, I'm a crypto weenie.  I know enough to spell RSA and DSA
correctly, and that's about it.)
Does anyone have any pointers to informative papers (especially analyses and
critiques) to RSA and DSA in particular, and in general, signature
algorithms?  The only page I've found is in the RSA Labs FAQ, and (obviously)
digs into DSA.  A co-worker is generating some SSH keys, and it's been some
time since I actually looked into either algorithm.  PuTTY recommends you
avoid DSA, which was a bit of a surprise to me, and prompted this thus-far
fruitless search for comparisons/critiques.

I was pointing out that your one presented argument (in the e-mail I read)
was completely not true.  Al Gore did *not* claim to invent the Internet,
and to use that false argument as a reason to dislike him is to be either
purposefully dishonest, or honestly misled.  I was simply correcting your
facts, and suggesting you check them out before you believe everything you
see/read in mass media.
The rest of your arguments are simply your opinions, and all I have to say
is: what little you knew of Bush and Gore /before/ the elections has no
bearing on the amount of information available about them.  Their histories
(criminal, educational, political, and family) were all very publicly
available.  Just because you (and, dare I say, a vast majority of the
American public) didn't want to do your research on your candidates, does
not mean that the facts weren't there.
You're also sadly, sadly mistaken in saying that there's only two options.
I guess it shows that you didn't vote.

Agreed, every politician has their own problems.  I /personally/ don't
believe that Mr. Gore was trying to take credit for 'inventing' the
Internet.  His wording is incredibly vague, and I agree that it could be
taken as him trying to take credit for building up the Internet to the point
it is today.
But he'd have to be *incredibly* stupid to actually believe that he could
get away with claiming he invented something that existed (albeit in various
forms) years previous.
My problem lays in the fact that not one person (save Gore himself) can
verifiably know what Gores intentions were with that statement.  The way he
phrased the statement is tricky, and leaves it pretty open to
interpretation.  But I hold fast that he was /not/ saying he invented the
Anyhow, I wasn't trying to get into a debate over what he said, although I
guess that was unavoidable.  I'm not trying to apologize for what he's said,
nor am I trying to make excuses.  If he's going to live in the public eye,
he's got to either maintain an impeccable character, or suffer its flaws.
My problem was that the statement /is/ vague, and the vagueness was then
translated into 'inventing the Internet'.  Which, again, isn't really all
that true.  Had sunder said, "Al 'Creating The Internet' Gore", that would
have been spot on, and I'd have chuckled.  But he didn't, so it wasn't, so I
: > I took initiative in building a house.  That's not saying that I built it,

: : Yeah, he was in there on John Postel's CC: list for RFC evaluations.
No, nor was I there for the developing of the blueprints, nor the chopping
of the trees, nor the mixing of the mortar.  But I still took initiative in
building the house.  Just as Gore took initiative in creating -- or rather,
helping to create, or helping to fund the creation of -- the Internet.
At this point, I concede that there's no way to tell the truth, and that
continued discussion can't really progress anywhere.  Al Gore munged his
words*, and paid the price.  End of story, and at this point, it doesn't much
matter what he really meant -- he's still not the president, nor will he
ever be.

spam.[1]  What SPF *does* do is make it easier to track it down -- the From
address will actually match the domain it was sent from.  This makes the
Abuse department's job *much* easier, as in theory, any spam complaint you
receive about your domain will be *from* your domain.
While this doesn't always mean you have a spammer in your midst, it /does/
mean that the piece of mail in question /did/ come from your networks, hence
it is something you can track down without worry about wasting time that
would be better spent elsewhere.
Arguably, this doesn't gain the anti-spam fighters anything, as the spam
still comes from somewhere.  But if you lay out the seriousness of the
problem to your subscriber, the chances of a repeat offense (which, ideally,
would result in account termination) drop to very close to zero.  This is
also something that ISPs can combat internally, such as forcing SMTP
authentication (which, granted, opens up a whole other bucket of worms), not
allowing outbound SMTP connections (unless explicitly granted), or having
only a web interface to e-mail (thus blocking all outbound SMTP connects,
even to their own mail servers, period).
The 'criminals' aren't necessarily 'steps ahead' -- they're just working
within the SPF framework, and doing exactly what SPF wanted them to do.  SPF
is *one* step towards limiting the volume of spam, but it in and of itself
does not.  There are a great number of other tools that, when combined with
SPF, can and do make a difference in the spam volume being sent.  Yes, each
tool has drawbacks, and I'm not going to claim otherwise.  But for the 95th
percentile, they won't really notice a difference.  Until their account is
cut off, that is.
[1] Any person who claims otherwise just plain doesn't understand SPF or its
goals.  Unfortunately, a few people have claimed that SPF will cut down on
the spam volume, and this take was snapped up by the media and subsequently
pushed out as the primary goal of SPF.  It is, AFAIK, generally agreed that
to cut down on spam volume, we need a whole different protocol from SMTP.

The actual MTA transmission only takes a few seconds; that is, unless you're

If you're sending out via something that encrypts and authenticates, it
might take a bit longer.  All the same, 15 seconds is plenty time to get off

In theory, TOR can support anything that can handle a SOCKS connection.  So
if your VoIP program can do SOCKS, then yes, it can.  If your VoIP program
can't, wrappers are readily available.
The question to ask here is: can TOR support VoIP /well/?  I wouldn't put
much faith in maintaining a solid VoIP connection: due to the very nature of
what TOR does, you're introducing a substantial amount of latency to your
connection, and it might be enough to throw off any VoIP connections you try
to make.

Generally speaking, it's not terribly difficult to convince a library

I'm in the midst of committing myself to leading a series of discussions
about privacy and anonymity on the Internet (though, to properly tackle the
subject, I'll have to embrace meatspace as well) with a given number of
likely non-technical persons.
Though I'm fairly comfortable discussing such matters amongst persons of
a technical inclination, when starting to prepare some outlines, I realized
that these two demographics have some significant differences.
I have pulled through any number of papers, publications, websites, books,
etc. that I still have kicking around, and though it /should/ be enough to
fill up all my allotted time, I thought a solicitation for help and pointers
couldn't hurt.
If you were to lead a discussion on privacy and anonymity (regardless of the
involvement of the Internet), what topics would you want to discuss?  Which
areas would you want to focus on?  How would you start out?

Global Eavesdroppers: If I'm doing something that I /really/ don't want
$TLA to know about, use some sort of anonymizing, zero-knowledge-ish
system.  A la Freenet or mixminion.  And judicious use of cryptography never
Corporate Aggregators: Just don't fill out personal information anywhere.
Or use bogus and contradictory information.
Social networks: Same kind of deal: don't use 'em.  Or, if for some reason I
find myself in a situation where that's not an appealing (or viable) option,
don't use real data.

Let's say that the crypto in Skype turns out to be a load of bunk (hey, it

Easily broken crypto, that is not advertised as such, is arguably worse than
no crypto: people do things under the illusion they're safe, when they
aren't.  Take WEP as an example of this: 'twould have been better to just

Anything to support that?
They /do/ claim that there are no back doors within the code.  And the quote
I was thinking of is:
    "Skype 'cooperates fully with all lawful requests from relevant
    authorities.'"
What we infer from that is meaningless: so long as they continue to make
vague comments about their call security and what they'll comply with, and
so long as their crypto remains closed, I'm not exactly filled with warm
fuzzies over their product.
However, no matter what your approach (the trusting or the paranoid), it's
all speculation.  So long as their crypto /does/ remain closed -- and
they've given nobody any reason to believe it will be anything but -- we'll
have a hard time telling just how good it actually is.
Like I said, I'm waiting for Zfone and ZRTP.

: I'm not convinced it's particularly useful, but I like the idea of a list : that is by default anonymous. One thing it might do is actually disguise : any anonymous remailer usage...ie, MwGs can't even determine who's trying : to be anonymous. There might be some other things it gives you as well...
Something I'd like to see is not just distributed feeders, etc., but
anonymous delivery endpoints.
i.e. My subscription to the list drops to an IMAP folder in the public
namespace.  I'm guessing if I allow anonymous authentication to my server,
and set up permissions properly, I should easily be able to allow someone
to read the group via IMAP (anonymously, of course).
In that vein, is cypherpunks distributed into USENET in any usable form?  (It
shouldn't be terribly difficult to set up a mail2news gateway.)  I did a
quick search, and couldn't find anything (alt.cypherpunk,
alt.privacy.cypherpunk, etc.).

: : Gmane handles that very simply and easily - just subscribe Gmane to the
: list and it sorts the rest out.
Sort of.
I still have concerns about whether reading via Gmane is /actually/
anonymous, but said concerns are going to be present in pretty much any
active form of obtaining the list.  To technologically ensure anonymity, it
would either need to be read via TOR (which, looking at TOR's threat model,
is not that close to perfect anonymity, but may be close enough for most
person's needs), or to feed it into something like Freenet.
There's also the concern that not everyone carries the Gmane feed.  It would
probably be more effective -- not to mention simpler, potentially more
anonymous, and more resilient -- to stick the list into a newgroup under the
alt namespace.

(I won't carry this thread further.  My apologies to the list for taking it
this far.)
I'm well aware that if Google doesn't have a cache, they will have translated
it to HTML.  But:
a) I don't trust Google.  Call me paranoid, but there's something about them
that doesn't sit well with me.
b) Using Google's HTML translation of a page doesn't help me when I'm at an
SSH console with no browser.  That's where fetch/wget, pdf conversion tools,
and text viewing tools come in handy.
c) If I was just complaining about not being able to get the document, I'd
have just shut up.  I'm not going to whine to a public list about not being
able to download a press release in PDF form.  My comment was more the
curiousities that the same day the PDF was posted to at least four
lists/groups I pay attention to, their server started returning an HTTP Bad
Request error for most (if not all) pages.

Google's released a meta-searching tool -- you can now see who's searching

A quick search for things like 'anonymous' and 'encryption' made me think.
And I'm positive there's data that's been pulled from the engine -- some
search terms show zero results.

Silly question:
Doesn't TOR's own model state they can /not/ protect against these types
of attacks?  When an attacker can monitor entry and exit points, isn't it
fairly trivial to identify who is talking to whom?  Why go through all the
extra trouble of inserting packets or signatures, when all you have to do is
watch the packet itself?
Especially since "Tor's DH key authentication of nodes and TLS tunnels"
would ensure data integrity, all you'd have to do is hash the incoming
packets, and see where they come out.
(Yes, that's not a trivial amount of work.  But I'd think it'd be easier
than manipulating packet flows.  I suppose that if you're manipulating the
flow, so long as the manipulation is automated, it could potentially be
easier to identify your manipulation when it approaches its endpoint.  But
still, it seems like a whole lot of extra work for no real added benefit, if
we're talking $TLA-style monitoring.)
Or am I missing something?
IMHO, this is a plug for something like Freenet and mixmaster/mixminion, and
other time-delayed communications (*ahem*True Names*ahem*).

libpurple may be a "rat's nest of zero days", but irssi+otr is a nightmare
to get working properly.  I've given up on it, and I've started using
mcabber+otr instead.
bitlbee+otr might be a better choice, and might provide the same network
access as libpurple, with irssi as the interface.  However, I can't comment
as to the usability of such a configuration.
