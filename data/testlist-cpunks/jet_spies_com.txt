About a year ago I got on a plane and flew cross country with an empty .22LR case wedged in the cleats of my boots.  I discovered it in the hotel while polishing my boots (had a wedding to attend the next morning) and was amused.
I guess they'd pick that up now, and I'd spend a few hours in the back with nurse ratchet and a box of rubber gloves.

You might want to do some research on  'thermite welding" -- it's a great way to put wires together as well:

I can't find any specific statement anyone made that the B61-11 weapons are being deployed.  I can find lots of mention of the GBU-28 being used. Pointers, please, to specific mentions of the B61-11
  being deployed?

References: It's been done that way for years on television vote tallies.  They never use, say, purple and orange, almost always red and blue (and green, I think for independents).  I'm not sure, but I think GOP has always been red and Dems have always been blue.

Back when I had an UTV, there were ads displayed whenever you went into grid that displayed TV listings.  I found that pretty damn annoying as well.
As for UTV trying any tricks, well, the division no longer exists, as I understand it.  Some elements of the UTV team were folded into another part of the organization.

...and they did this at the request of the BBC who paid them to do it.
yeesh.  I don't think anyone came out of this looking good.
making it easier to bypass paying for service than it is on the TiVo, just activate the right tier and presto, UTV service.

Recently here in Palo Alto, a latino teenager was railroaded by the cops and almost convicted of raping an elderly white lady.  Nevermind those pesky DNA tests, he confessed after many hours in police custody without representation.
Lawyers kept him from being framed by forcing a DNA test that failed to match his DNA with that of the rapist.
The lawyers that freed him might not consider the law "majestic", but I think they have good reason to sleep well at night.
