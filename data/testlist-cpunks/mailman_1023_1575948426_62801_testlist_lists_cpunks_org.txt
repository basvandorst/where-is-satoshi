   [1]Ville Oksanen writes "Privacy International (PI) and European
   Digital Rights (EDRI) have published their [2]joint answer to [3]the
   consultation on mandatory data retention. The European Commission
   asked for public comments on a proposed retention regime across Europe
   between 12 and 36 months for all traffic data generated by using fixed
   and mobile telephony and Internet. As [4]Statewatch puts it: 'This is
   a proposal so intrusive that Ashcroft, Ridge and company can only
   dream about it, exceeding even the U.S. Patriot Act.' EDRI and PI are
   currently collecting endorsements from organizations and companies for
   their stamement [5]here. This is unfortunately not enough to stop the
   process - expecially more should be done in the member states, which
   ultimately decide the fate of the proposal. So contact your local
   politicians today!"
