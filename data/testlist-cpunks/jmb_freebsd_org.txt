what i conclude.  on page 4 start of the 4th paragraph "The Chinese Remainder Theorem RSA attack can also be adapted to use only known ciphertext, and thus can be used to attack RSA digital signatures."
its encrypted version.  When Alice signs Bob's public key, with her private key of course, she is encrypting Bob's public key.  this allows Charlie to use Alice's public key to decrypt the signature, recovering a message that is identical to Bob's public key.  that's the proof that Alice was the signer.

(therefore multiuser)?   or on a dedicated host, with a know algorithm and known ciphertext running DOS (no kernel or anything to preempt the process)?   using the famous appendix H registers of a 586 allows you to time the processing of instructions very well.
walk the key bit by bit (ouch bad pun) guessing 1 or 0 each time and looking to see if the correlations continue to appear or not.  horrendous problem, but a lot better than brute force.
