Well, Dave, here's a couple of relevant personal thoughts regarding
vacuum-cleaner-like data gathering...
1) there's a saying I heard recently that the NSA's approach to
intelligence is like trying to find a needle in the haystack by
sending tractors in the field to gather more hay.  Based on my
understanding of the reliability of inference-making I suspect the
problem is that and worse.   So these so-called vacuum-cleaner
technologies probably won't improve the ability to predict terrorism
that much, but the elimination of checks and balances will almost
certainly result in lots of "false positives" that can be used as
presumptive reasons to harass both US citizens and foreigners for
"inferences" that are little more than wild-ass intuitions about what
kind of activity might be correlated with bad actors.   Of course
there are lots of technology companies who sell stuff to the
intelligence community who are full of hyperbolic claims about the
wonders of mass data collection and analysis, but if they were so
good, why don't they predict the stock market instead and make money
the old fashioned way?   Predicting the stock market is a trivial
problem compared to predicting and preventing terrorism, but in the
market there is actually a measure of success, whereas the measure of
success in the beltway intelligence technology business is getting
another, bigger contract.  (that's what comes from outsourcing to a
military-industrial complex that is so big it can buy members of
Congress, lock stock and barrel, as we saw with Duke Cunningham).
2) what the NSA does outside the US may be legal under US law, but by
no means is it either legal or a source of pride when viewed in other
countries or in international law.
The grand glorious endeavor of spying is fundamentally anti-social
and anti-humanity.   Apparently, part of the standard CIA induction
briefing is being reminded that humint is just another word for
fraud, deception, burglary, and other things that we do not tolerate
in civilized societies.   If agents carrying out such acts are
discovered in our country they can be executed, and by symmetry most
countries can and will execute our spies if caught.   (this may be
cruel and unusual, because theft of information inside a country is
usually punished by more lenient methods).
Sigint (though the hands *seem* cleaner) is legally and morally just
wire fraud and peeping-tomism etc. by another name, and again, agents
who listen in on radio or wire conversations in other countries are
violating their laws, just as agents doing that in the US would be
guilty of espionage and subject to execution or harsh penalties.   So
by any "golden rule" standard of justice we should be careful.
One can argue that, just as war is sometimes thought to be necessary
to deal with threats to the citizens of our nation, intelligence
gathering, however illegal, might also be sometimes necessary.   But
it's not a "good" at any level, and hardly something we should be
proud of.
However, the thrill of hanging out with the codebreakers shouldn't be
used to glamorize what is, at its core, just a government-sanctioned
form of antisocial behavior.  It's practitioners cannot be trusted to
decide what is appropriate, because they are by definition able to
carry out acts that are antisocial and illegal.

@_subject: [IP] Re: Department of Homeland and Security wants   
master key for DNS
A dirty little secret is that the late, lamented and sensible Jon  Postel once demonstrated how easy it would be to take the entire  Internet out of the hands of the government entirely, because in fact  the decision of what the "root" is is pretty damned arbitrary.  (because people who think roots and port numbers are "real" seem to  fantasize about physical metaphors that create more reality than  there is here, so you have to show them).
I think it would still be a small project to take the roots away from  the US Gov't entirely, once and for all.   If they demand the key and  get it with the purpose of enforcing yet another attack on collective  will, I am happy to help.   Nothing illegal is necessary.  99% of  humanity will probably volunteer to join the new root system - both  libertarian conservatives and liberal thinkers are pretty much  together on this.  I'm pretty sure Microsoft and Apple (and I know  Linux) communities would happily substitute a new root for a "gov't  censored" one - and I don't think appeals to "child molesters" and  "terrorists" and other bloody shirts being waved would cause them to  think twice.  What might get Microsoft to play ball is a promise to  stop hammering them on antitrust, but hey, they have to worry about  the next administration and the one after that - companies outlive  And even if Microsoft didn't put the new roots in, it's really easy  to distribute a root replacement add-in or to add it to the NAT boxes.
So "self help" is why the government might want to think twice about  sticking this screwdriver in their own eye.
Yeah, as John Levine says, the ICANN may not be a very mature body,  but just think what the maturity of your favorite governmental figure  is like.   Do you like the "liberals"?  Do you like the "religious  right"?   Do you like the Hillary?  What about the Cheney?
In the matter of the DNS, we the users of the Internet hold all the  power.   The master key is a fantasy.

@_subject: [IP] Re: Urgent Call For a Google At-Large Public Ombudsman 
Google needs more criticism.   Both constructive and hostile.   It's  odd that anyone thinks otherwise.
But I find this discussion odd.   When a newspaper or government  creates a position of Ombudsman, the typical reason is that they find  themselves the target of withering criticism, in a bad place, and  want to earn back some trust.  An Ombudsman, after all, starts out in  a very tough, corrupted position.   Their salary is paid for by the  folks they are asked to criticize.  Without a very strong external  source of hostility, an Ombudsman *cannot* be effective.  I think if  you talk to any practicing Ombudsman, you will find that they agree.   (I'd be interested if they didn't, too.)
It would do Google a great deal of good to be under the threat of  serious anti-trust action.  They are (IMO) a monopoly in their  market, and if that became settled law, there are a whole set of  rules they must follow as a result.  Surely their corporate counsel  understand this, and while they will publicly fight such a decision  because it does hamper their potential returns to stockholders, the  anti-trust laws are the law of the land for a reason.
That some of the IP correspondents are fearful that they will be  harmed by Google if they say such things is troubling.   It reflects  the fear that US society is operating under today - a "lawless  Department of Justice" may not be a correct description of the state  of things, but the actions of the DoJ and many practicing lawyers are  troubling.   The goal of many actions seems to be to attack popular  dissent against actions of corporations and the government by using  the law as a weapon to harm dissenters, rather than using law as a  tool of justice.
Perhaps I'm foolish too.   I have friends who work at Google, just as  I have friends who work at Microsoft.  Just because they are friends  I don't think they should be "above the law", and just because they  have created great wealth for us all and also for their investors, I  don't think that gives them a free pass to do whatever they damn  please in the future.
So I think Lauren is wimping out in calling for an Ombudsman.   Let  Google decide that it needs one, as a result of proper public  criticism of its actions.  Perhaps rather than appointing an  Ombudsman, they will actually "do the right thing" which would be far  better than merely creating a whitewashing process.

@_subject: Big brother would be envious... 
MIT policy requires that the Committee on the Use of Humans in  Experimental Studies (COUHES) approve all such experiments.  The  experiments described are "opt-in" with "informed consent" when  carried out at MIT.  No one is required to participate.
Yet I agree that carrying out such experiments in corporate settings  (including MIT) are fraught with concerns.
That said, this is a future that is already here.  Your laptop and  phone have live microphones and cameras, and phones report their  geographic position to carriers, where the logs are recorded in  corporate databases for months or years, and can be subpeonaed  (hopefully with probable cause, as is the case in Massachusetts state  courts, but not in FBI National Security Letters).
Don't shoot the messenger (MIT students).  They are just adapting to  the reality that we grownups have constructed for them.
The law doesn't provide for any of the desired privacy rights.   If  you carry a phone or corporate laptop, and it turns on its microphone  based on a remote command from either the NSA or a botnet, *it is not  illegal*.  The phone company owns the phone, your employer owns the  laptop, and the legal precedents are not in the users' favor.
In the case of corporate laptops, it is claimed that corporations are  REQUIRED to monitor and record employee communications, because of  precedents that hold them liable for sexual and racial harassment.
In the case of private cellphones, you don't hold the radio license  or the software license.   The carrier does, and under NSL regime  today, it can be required to capture and search - without any  requirement to notify you.
So, you are screwed.   I wish that were not the case, myself.   But  don't assume *anyone* in the US Gov't, including your Senators and  Representatives, will come to your aid.   If you live in  Massachusetts, your state might.  But in other states, you are on  your own.
