Hi, Folks
        I am looking for the best file encryption program and the best file
wiping program.
PC compatible, perferably Win 95 compatible.

OBVIOUSLY the spokesman of the group. I ask for help and this is what I get?
        One more time, I'm well aware of the capabilities of PGP. What I'm
looking for is a program
that does a better job of binary encryption than just Radix 64 ASCII armoring.

My goof. I reread the manual and it is clear now. Why I didn't catch
it the first go round,
I don't know. I guess I'm just blind or stupid. Thanks again for your
help..........BY the way,
does any one know of a "good" file wiping program that I can either download
or buy.
Preferably, military grade.

@_subject: Tell me whats wrong with this 
Tell me whats wrong with this section of the telecom bill.  I have a six
year old boy I am trying to raise
and it is hard enough to teach him respect and values without explaining why
Ned Beatty is being
bungholed in the woods by Billy Bob or why the Terminator splattered this
guys brains all over the
wall.          Tell me why parents should not be able to censor their OWN
television so that they may raise their children the way THEY see
fit...................Did your dad give you his old
Did he take you down to your grandmothers autopsy before her
funeral?...................I Don't Think So.....
        Honestly, don't you believe that what a child is exposed to effects
his judgement, perception,
 attitude,and character??
All I'm saying is it's tough to raise a child these days without the added
distortion of modern programing and parents need not be denied any tool that can help them
achieve success.
 SEC. 551. PARENTAL CHOICE IN TELEVISION PROGRAMMING.
            (a) FINDINGS- The Congress makes the following findings:
                (1) Television influences children's perception of the values
              and behavior that are common and acceptable in society.
                (2) Television station operators, cable television system
              operators, and video programmers should follow practices in
              connection with video programming that take into consideration
              that television broadcast and cable programming has established
              a uniquely pervasive presence in the lives of American children.
                (3) The average American child is exposed to 25 hours of
              television each week and some children are exposed to as much               as 11 hours of television a day.
                (4) Studies have shown that children exposed to violent video
              programming at a young age have a higher tendency for violent
              and aggressive behavior later in life than children not so
              exposed, and that children exposed to violent video programming
              are prone to assume that acts of violence are acceptable
              behavior.
                (5) Children in the United States are, on average, exposed to
              an estimated 8,000 murders and 100,000 acts of violence on
              television by the time the child completes elementary school.
                (6) Studies indicate that children are affected by the
              pervasiveness and casual treatment of sexual material on
              television, eroding the ability of parents to develop
              responsible attitudes and behavior in their children.
                (7) Parents express grave concern over violent and sexual
              video programming and strongly support technology that would
              give them greater control to block video programming in the               home that they consider harmful to their children.
                (8) There is a compelling governmental interest in empowering
              parents to limit the negative influences of video programming
              that is harmful to children.
                (9) Providing parents with timely information about the               nature of upcoming video programming and with the technological
              tools that allow them easily to block violent, sexual, or other
              programming that they believe harmful to their children is a
              nonintrusive and narrowly tailored means of achieving that
              compelling governmental interest.

You probably had no problem with seat belts being manditory eqiupment ,
because they protected YOU and the people YOU cared about. You probably had no problem with manditory airbags, public building smoke
alarms, unleaded
fuel, restaurant health codes,etc....Because they protected you and or
people you care about,
even though they cost YOU more money.
It's obvious that you watch a lot television your an excellent sensationalist.
Besides, we both no that the cost of the chip is insignificant. This device
hurts no one!

Untrue most of them have responded to my correspondence.
For example, I live in Atlanta Ga. and Senator Bradley is a representative
of New Jersey. Here is his letter. By the way I have many more from
many other members of both House and Senate.
     Thank you for contacting me to express your views concerning
     the Communications Decency Act of 1995, which was recently passed as      part of S. 652, the Telecommunications Act of 1995.  I greatly      appreciated the opportunity to review your thoughts on this issue.
          Although the advances being made in our nation's information
     and communications network are revolutionary and welcome, they also      provide openings for individuals to transmit obscene materials to      children and to lure children.  Throughout my career in the U.S.      Senate, I have consistently encouraged the recording industry and the      television industry to limit explicit violence and sex on television.       Given the widespread growth of information networks, I supported the      Communications Decency Act as a means to curtail children's exposure      to offensive materials and to give parents some control over the      things their children see and hear.
          While I supported this amendment because I believe there is a
     need for some safeguards against obscenity, I do have some concerns      about the implementation of this provision, if it becomes law. There      should be a distinction between indecent and obscene material, as      there is in other relevant laws.  Furthermore, this particular      amendment does not adequately reflect the unique nature of the      Internet, in which information crosses many computers and access      points before reaching the user.  Finally, I was disappointed that the      Senate did not have an opportunity to consider an alternative proposal      suggested by Senator Leahy.  This measure would have provided more      safeguards to ensure that First Amendment rights were preserved, but      still would have accomplished the overall objective of the adopted      version.           Determining who should be held responsible for disseminating
     obscene material may be difficult.  I am concerned that this could      lead to an overall chilling effect on online communication as users      fear that they may be held responsible for material they did not      originate.
          Please be assured that I will keep your views in mind as the
     joint House-Senate conference committee attempts to reconcile the      differences between the two versions of the Telecommunications Act of      1995.           Again, thank you for contacting me to share your views.  I
     hope to hear from you again in the near future.
          Best wishes.
                                     Senator Bill Bradley
                                     Washington, DC 20510
