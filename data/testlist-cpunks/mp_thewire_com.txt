Marc Plumb and I are trying to organize a "signing party"
for anyone within range of downtown Toronto.  The tentative
date is the afternoon of Saturday September 7th.  Location
will depend on the size of the crowd: so RSVP to Marc or
myself ( or ) and one
of us will get back to you during the first week of September
with the precise details.  Be patient!
