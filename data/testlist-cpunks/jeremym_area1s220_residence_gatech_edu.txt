@_subject: Active processes monitoring? 
There are a number of process viewing applications available for Win95/NT.
I use two of them: one is called pstat.exe and the other is ps.exe.  Both of
show most of the visible processes running.  ps does not show running services,
but pstat does.  Both of them are available at

@_subject: ITSEC? 
Here's what I found:
A quick search of INSPEC (described below) turned up some useful results, as
INSP (INSPEC)         Citations and abstracts of articles in physics, electronics,
engineering, computer and information technology journals. A keyword search for ITSEC revealed 30+ documents related to IT and systems
security measures.  The citation below seemed the most useful:
        Sizer, R.  "Information technology security evaluation criteria
(ITSEC)."  _Computer_Bulletin_, vol.5, pt.5, p.7.  Oct. 1993.   ISSN:
00104531 ;;gtec.  Keywords: data integrity. data privacy. security of data.
Class codes: C0310D. C6130S.  Date indexed: 12/93.
        The insecurity of IT systems (typified by unauthorised access) is a
complex and increasingly aggravating social problem. All sectors of
society-commerce, industry, government (local and national) and domestic are
at risk. People who have the responsibility for choosing, installing or
using IT systems have faced considerable difficulty in choosing IT security
products purporting to provide a 'secure environment' employing technical
security mechanisms in hardware and software. The problem has, in the main,
been the highly subjective claims for, and interpretation of, those security
mechanisms. The ITSEC criteria involve the independent evaluation of IT
products and systems (hardware and software) which claim security features.
Security includes confidentiality, integrity and availability
I have access via my local library to the first document (the actual ITSEC
specification) but not to the second.  You should be able to find the
_Computer_Bulletin_ at most universities with CS majors.
Hope this helps,

Let me restate your cardinal rule, direct from your "alert":
How about we here it again, just because it's so well thought out:
Now, the fact that your customer database of credit card numbers
is not directly available via the Internet does not make it cease to
be a computer.  Regardless of its networkability, it is still a computer.
Do you suggest, then, that computers cannot exist without networks?
And just *where* do they get entered?   Into a computer.
And *how* are they entered?  Via a keyboard.
What was that?  You guys enter credit card numbers via the
keyboard?  But YOU CAN'T DO THAT!  IT'S NOT SAFE!
If I can't trust myself to keep my credit card number secure, why
should I trust your minimum-wage data entry employees?
I believe that you thought more about writing your glorified keyboard
sniffer than you did deciding how to announce your discovery to the public.

Then why should an attacker even bother to infect users' machines
with your program?  There is a much better way.  Let me outline it
for you:
The keyboard sniffer can be modified to attach to the computer
which holds your customer database.  It simply watches for card
numbers (which is even more trivial than doing so on the client's
machine, as it's the only thing this machine does) and stores them.
Then, when the attacker calls in to set up an account, the keyboard
sniffer is alerted (by any of several methods, such as a specific,
probably invalid, credit card number) and replaces this value with
a card number that was previously captured.  In this manner the
attacker has obtained a valid FV account drawn on a valid credit
card number of a real FV customer.  This account can then be
used to purchase various goods and services.  And while it causes
a similar degree of damage as your previous scheme, it also
causes you to lose money in the process.  Since you are the
verifier (in the function of the bank) in this case, then you will
lose out in the event of fraud.  The credit card companies will
still receive their money, and guess who will pay it:  FV!
This method has several other benefits over your previous scheme.
Your scheme required infection of numerous computers;
this scheme requires infecting only one computer.  And while
one may be held liable for the infection of the database computer,
the person who opens the fake FV account cannot.  All s/he has
done is call you up and follow procedure.  Even if he were dumb
enough (as we know many criminals are) to give you his real
card number over the telephone, it would not show up in your
database.  He would be completely clean... no trace.
Furthermore, once the rogue program is in place, EVERY attack
As a corollary to this attack, the attacker could design his/her
trojan to watch for the creation of new accounts and replace
the intended FV_ID with another value created by a PRNG
seeded by a known value.  The attacker can then seed his/her
copy of the PRNG with the same value and conduct valid
(although fraudulent) transactions using the generated FV_IDs.
With this approach he does not even have to contact your
new accounts office via telephone; s/he simply implants the
trojan and begins making transactions.  This is similar to the
above attack with regard to payment liability.

Question: Could you please describe the nature of the First Virtual protocol?  Now before you tell me to RTFM, let me explain.
I assume, although without absolute certainty, that in order to bill me
you must know my credit card number.  If you do not know my credit
card number, and depend on someone else who does, you are nothing
more than a middleman who introduces additional possibility for
breach of security.  If you do know my credit card number, you must
deal with the associated problem of storing this number.  Now perhaps
I am wrong, and you really do keep all of your clients' card numbers
in a printed book hidden within a safe, and for each transaction you
remove the book, use your table to match FV_ID to CC process the
transaction, and replace the book.  However, I doubt this.  More
likely, you store the card numbers on a computer.  And no doubt,
someone or something enters those numbers into a database.
You have just violated your own cardinal rule.
