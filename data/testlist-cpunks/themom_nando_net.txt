Really there is no 'Correct' solution some students function better
    in Public Schools, some in private and others in home.  I know of success
    stories and failures in each.  I had a couple of friends who were in home school during their Freshman and Sophomore year in highschool but then decided to go back to public school, they were so far behind it wasn't funny...any ways, one droped out and then other is just now getting back in the "groove" of things (he is a junior).  I guess the choice of schools is up to the individual, personally I am a student of a Public school, Enloe High, and truely hate it, I would perfer being in a private school but, I do not have that kind of money to spend, sure I could go to a cheep private school and not have the advantages of the people in public schools which (strangely) have more money.  I could also do home school but my parents would drive me insane .   But I totally disagree with the posts saying public school students become drug dealers, NONE, of my friends do drugs, drink, smoke, etc...   Most students turn out to be functional members of society, with a few odd balls ruining the reputation of the public school system...
Thats just my two cents.....

I have to agree with the final Quote....I am Good in math, chemistry and computer science I am good in any Logical cource but I have trouble in places liek " Creative Writing" I take all AP cources and make A's and B every now and again in english...I have a 3.7 gpa but a LOW sat in the grammar and english sections, 1100 in all I don't think colleges should look at the subjects you dont plan to major in...I plan to major in computer science when I go to college, so I dont think they should look so much at say english, or biology.  I get so frustrated in some of those classes....BTW I am a Junior in highschool
