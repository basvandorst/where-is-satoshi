What if it's just a ruse by them to ID it as RC2? They could have even
released a bogus version themselves, and then sent up a hue and cry....

No wizard I, but I think that it is showing you all programs (TSRs, drivers,
etc) loaded _before_ Windows. I do not see it showing programs loaded in
other Dos windows. (Edit, XyWrite, dBase, MSD, etc.)

Wouldn't this require some software routines added to check for this?  I
expect the decision to build or buy is what CIS is now weighing. Also, I
would imagine that a German could always call a POP outside the country if
they wanted to pay for it..... (note that I am still not in favor of the
action, but these are probably CIS's considerations.)

Yes, I agree. I think the real difference is that they really cannot tell
where you are calling from, even though they know where you are
connecting.

@_subject: Netscape "secure E-Mail" 
When I examine the headers from a PC running any POP client including
Netscape, (where the return path is smtp), they show up as originating
from the PC's address, whether direct net or dial-up PPP. Wouldn't that
indicate that the message is using SMTP not https over the link? (and
therefore in fact in the clear unless encrypted in body?) I think the
inclusion of the option of the Exchange client is a possible shift of the
onus of PEM to MS.  (frightening thought....)
 Where are MOSS and SMIME now?

I think the simplest solution is to not use Netscape for mail. Don't put your address in there in the first place.

But would you do all your correspondence on postcards? Pay bills, etc? I
think there is a place for postcards, but most mail is in envelopes.

This was what brought William Freidman to Riverside, where he both

@_subject: [CTRL] Fwd: DNA Sample with Every Arrest 
Not sure where this is from but:
   "The government already has DNA samples from all US citizens, why else
    do you think they kept the copper penny in circulation?"   I doubt copper can really collect DNA, and even if so, how they'd
correlate it with individuals, but with public health vaccinations and
(HMO at least) medical exams, the USG has had the opportunity to
collect DNA samples of a very large percentage of the population already.
