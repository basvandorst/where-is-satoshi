Which reminds me of...
Netscape can export 40-bit versions of Communicator, and according to one of their own employees (search back in the archives if you don't believe me) the only difference between the 40-bit version and the 128-bit version is a license file. Now license files aren't covered in export regulations, are they? So it's legal to export the 40-bit version of Communicator (which contains disabled 128-bit crypto) and it's legal to export the license file. Sounds like it's either not true or the government is stupider than I thought or the government is tired of trying to enforce such futile laws.
