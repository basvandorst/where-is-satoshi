@_subject: anonymous poster software 
I hacked this up in a little under an hour (with distractions), so it's not
the absolute best software - it could stand some improvement - but it works.
It could, with very minor hacking, do as an anonymous mailer.  I wrote it
in response to someone asking me if I could write such a thing for them in
C.  Yes, there are lots of itty-bitty remailers and posters out there, but
this serves the bill for being totally anonymous and it's pretty quick, being
written in C.
Besides, I didn't want to learn perl or any of that grotesque stuff - I'm a
purist at heart ;)
