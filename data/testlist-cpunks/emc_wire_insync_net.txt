Good one, Bob. WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Online pornographers should be required to use
encryption, said Rep. Bob Goodlatte, (R, Va.) Tuesday at the Internet
Online Summit: Focus on Children conference held here.
"That would certainly keep it away from children," said Goodlatte.
"I'm not advocating encryption to let pornography flourish."
Goodlatte, a champion of loosening encryption legislation, has
sponsored legislation to allow the export of encryption products and
another bill in the intellectual property arena, as well as another
bill increasing liability for those found guilty of running Internet
gambling operations.
Goodlatte was the afternoon speaker in place of Newt Gingrich, speaker
of the House, who couldn't attend.
In addition, Attorney General Janet Reno postponed her appearance
until Wednesday morning at 10:30.
Goodlatte took the opportunity to speak of the Clinton adminstration's
policy on encryption. "The Clinton administration's current encryption
policies are a severe hinderance on the development of the full
potential of the Internet," he said.
He also said the House Judiciary Committee will begin a review of the
Clinton administration's enforcement of laws on obscenity.

The Blue-Nosed Guardian (Nikki Craft, NJ)
                 December 4, 2000; THURSDAY; ALL EDITIONS
SECTION: OPINION;
HEADLINE: PEDOPHILES IN THE BIOSPHERE;
WE MUST STOP SPOKEN CHILD PORNOGRAPHY EVERYWHERE
BYLINE: The Record
The increasing presence of child pornography in spoken communications
is a national problem that must be dealt with aggressively and
quickly. This is not a free-speech or First Ammendment issue.  Child
pornography is a crime.  We do not tolerate it on our computers, and
we should not tolerate it in audiospace.
Unfortunately, as a Page One article in the Blue-Nosed Guardian
pointed out yesterday, audiospace is tailor-made for the dissemination
of child pornography.  It allows peophiles instant access to explicit
descriptions of childhood sexual activity almost anywhere, and it
gives distributors and collectors enough anonymity to avoid getting
caught and being prosecuted.
Using advanced non-digital technology, two pedophiles can meet almost
anywhere, and exchange explicit descriptions of childhood sexual
activity, with little fear of detection.  Phrases like "Timmy, aged 7,
has a stiffie" and "Little Mary's muffin swelled and moistened when
she saw little Timmy's cute red knob" can be exchanged with ease
vicariously victimizing inocent children worldwide by transforming
them into sexual objects for pedophiles' selfish gratification.
In fact, the ease of communicating descriptions of childhood sexual
activity through the spoken word may actually have broadened the
audience for child pornography.  And law enforcement officials worry
that this may lead to increased child abuse, because American parents
might actually begin to believe that guilt-free sex-positive messages
are good for children, in lieu of the normal beatings and
state-mandated psychotherapy.
Vice President and famed child-rearing expert Dr. James Dobson has
been leading a campaign to make sound waves safe for children.  This
week, he announced a new partnership between cities and the Justice
Department effort to crack down on child pornography, and a toll-free
hotline where people may report any neighbors heard discussing the
sexuality of minors in terms other than those used in Surgeon General
Phyllis Schlafly's "Innocence and Abstinence" report.
But law enforcement officials, sound wave experts, and child advocates
say it's not that easy, by any means.  Even if landlords, businesses,
and professionals cooperate in monitoring all speech uttered by
persons on their premises, there are hundreds of small conversations
which take place in other locations, where people are loathe to police
others, because of liability concerns, or because they consider it to
be a waste of time.
The Blue-Nosed Guardian's article also pointed out that most law
enforcement officials are not knowlegable enough to track down child
pornography distributors, who are experts at whispering spoken
descriptions of child sexual activity and finding new ways to conceal
their communications from onlookers.  Law enforcement officials may
also lack the manpower needed to track down pedophiles.  "If we want
to break into someones house and install recording equipment," one
investigator said, "we actually have to go in front of a judge and get
a warrant." Child advocates say they hope to eliminate such "loopholes
for pedophiles" in the future.
Many more "audiocops" are needed at the federal, state, and local
levels, who have the expertise to stay ahead of spoken communication,
and much more manpower and training is needed.
In New Jersey, state Sen. stupid fuck Andrew Ciesla, has introduced a
bill which would set aside $400,000,000 of money stolen from the
taxpayers for a special unit to investigate spoken child pornography,
and create a 24-hour toll-free state hot line for people to turn in
their neighbors.
Alerting the authorities is a key component of this crackdown, and Dr.
Dobson also announced a national "AudioTip" hotline to report any
comments about childhood sexuality which might be overheard.  Dr.
Dobson also took the opportunity to plug his new book, "Dare to
Discipline III: Electrotorture and Enemas."
The Vice President is to be commended for seeking ways to stop these
ugly predators.  But this effort must be more than just lip service.
It must result in all Americans understanding that children have no
sexual feelings, and engage in no sexual behavior prior to age 18
unless they have been corrupted by pedophiles, and that abstinence is
the expected behavior of those over 18, before entering into a stable
marriage which can only be terminated by the death of one of the
In the meantime, intense pressure should be brought to bear on the
non-mute citizen units, and those who supervise them, to make a huge
dent in this particularly vile audiocrime, through aggressive
self-policing and frequent government-sponsored self-criticism

A new.com article posted by Declan says:
Of course most people exchanging such pictures via email are no more child
pornographers than people who read "Penthouse" are photographers of women.
Again, law enforcement manages to build its agenda into the vocabulary
given to the Sheeple to express their views. This is one good reason most bright people who publicly point and laugh at
the government's molester and porn festivities go out of their way not to
engage in communication with children, or private communication with
individuals claiming to share their views.
I prefer to express mine on Usenet, where what I have said is a matter of
public record, and can't be spun by wannabe entrappers for their own ends. And aren't these cops pathetic?  I mean, you're sitting on the Net, and
someone who has targeted you because you made fun of the child porn kooks
gets you on IRC and begs you to "call his modem direct, because he's 14,
his parents aren't home, and he has special pictures to send you." I mean, what do these doughnut-munching lard-assed buffoons tell their
children they do for a living?  "Yes, Jimmy, Daddy pretends to be a child
on the Internet and offers other grownups pictures of his genitalia." Gosh - I bet that makes the kid want to invite Dad to school for career
day. Kind of like the people in alt.parenting.spanking. And since jackbooted thug Daufenbach will never get a chance to "blow it" in real life, he has to engage in the substitution therapy
of finding others who might "blow it."  After all, this is a highly
moral society in which "it" must never be "blown", particularly if "it" is attached something that is not legally a person in the eyes
of the Constitution.
BTW - it's the 12th of December.  Wasn't this supposed to be D-day for James Dalton Bell?

@_subject: All Children Work in Sweatshops 
One of the interesting things about the child porn crusades is the
terminology manipulation employed to officially describe more and more
innocuous things as officially being "child porn," and by inference,
describing those who object the slightest bit to the government's
violation of the First Ammendment as "child porn supporters." Now the wonders of government terminology have been applied to a new
problem, the "scourge" of child labor.  While an historical review will
clearly demonstrate that laws preventing minors from working and earning a
living had their origins in times when adult unemployment was high, and
were heavily pushed by the public school teachers labor unions and
immigrant parents outraged that their children had an opportunity for
financial independence, the myth that such laws exist to "protect
children" instead of to economically and politically disempower them
persist. Enter the current crusade, being heavily trumpeted by the media, to rescue
children from "sweatshops." What is a sweatshop, you may ask? According to the official definition, a "sweatshop" is a workplace that
engages in repeated labor violations involving wages, hours worked, or the
age of its employees. So by the magic of government definitions, all unlawfully employed minors
automatically work in "sweatshops," by virtue of their being illegally
employed. All people arguing for the right of minors to work of course "support
sweatshops," and all consumers and stores who buy goods produced by these
illegally employed minors are purchasing "goods produced by children
working in sweatshops." 290,200 children are alleged to have been employed illegally last year,
(in sweatshops of course). And woe to anyone who doesn't support the call to liberate these children
from their paychecks. (er, sweatshops) The US is now attempting to export its crusade against so-called "child
labor" to third world nations, citing of course only the most egregious
examples in the case histories it presents.  The US still refuses to sign
the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child because it prohibits the
execution of minors, which many US states permit, and guarantees minors
access to reproductive health information.

The parents who whine the loudest about porn are the same parents who

@_subject: Sloppy Chips from Intel 
By now everyone has probably heard that Intel Pentium and Pentium MMX
chips hang when executing the instruction sequence F00FC7C8 even when
in an outer ring of privilege or in V86 mode.
With numerous small Linux-based ISPs out there, often providing shell
services to anonymous customers, or serving customer-provided CGI
programs, the existence and public disclosure such an easily
exploitable flaw in their CPU's hardware protection mechanism is
Intel, rather than extensively verifying their microprocessors before
shipping them out the door, now advertises that its chips may contain
"errata," or "deviations from published specifications" and doesn't
seem to regard such problems as any big deal.
This latest flaw is the third unexpected surprise in Intel's Pentium
product line.  A serious precision problem in double precision
floating divide was discovered in early Pentium chips, and it was
recently disclosed that there are circumstances under which the
Pentium Pro may fail to generate an exception when a Float to Integer
conversion overflows.
While today's problem does not permit clandestine entry into a system,
since it kills the system when it is exercised, it does raise the
question of whether there are other more subtle problems in the
hardware protection mechanism, which might enable knowlegable users to
execute an occasional instruction at the wrong privelege level, or
otherwise do things which should be prohibited according to the
published hardware specifications.
It is interesting to note that such problems have not been reported in
compatible chips manufactured by AMD, a competitor of Intel.
Buggy microprocessor microcode can produce very subtle exploitable
faults in a chip, which are almost impossible to notice when running
ordinary applications and operating systems.  Instructions may do the
wrong thing only when they follow certain other instructions.  There
may be rare times when the processor is wrongly interruptable, or when
a restricted instruction is not forbidden, or is given access at the
wrong privilege level, or with incorrect address translation.
Were such features to be deliberately introduced into a chip, in order
to permit a backdoor for undetected entry, they could be made
completely undetectable, and could depend upon any number of unlikely
conditions, or even specific hidden register values, in order to be
made manifest.  Every microprocessor could even have its own "key" for
the activation of such "special features."
Unlike Unix, for which complete compilable source code is available,
we know little about what what microcode is run through the several
million transistors on a typical microprocessor. If sloppy engineering
alone produces such dangerous faults, imagine what could happen should
industry decide to deliberately cooperate with various LEAs and TLAs.
(In the national interest, of course.)
The possiblities are truly mind-boggling.  Perhaps exploits like tapping
Aldrich Ames' PC and crashing Saddam Husseins' PCs en masse were not done
by black bag jobs and viri, but by the activation of "National Security"
backdoors present in all complex modern microprocessors.

RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Ruling that the right to a free press doesn't
cover a how-to-kill book, a federal appeals panel said the families
of a hired killer's victims may sue the publisher of a book that he
A three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied
First Amendment protection to ``Hit Man: A Technical Manual for
Independent Contractors,'' saying publisher Paladin Press knew it
would be used by murderers.
``The Supreme Court has never protected as abstract advocacy speech so
explicit in its palpable entreaties to violent crime,'' the panel
said in its ruling Monday.
The book was sold to James Edward Perry, who was convicted of killing
Mildred Horn; her disabled 8-year-old son, Trevor; and the son's
nurse, Janice Saunders, in Silver Spring, Md., in 1993. The women were
shot between the eyes and the boy's respirator was unplugged.
Perry is on death row for the murders, and Lawrence T. Horn, Mrs.
Horn's former husband, was sentenced to life in prison for hiring
Perry. Horn's motive was to collect $1.7 million from a malpractice
settlement that his son Trevor won from a hospital after the accident
that left him a quadriplegic.
Paladin has never challenged Perry's claim that he followed some of
the 130-page paperback's advice.
``This decision says that if you're in the business of helping
instruct murderers on how to slaughter innocent women and children,
you aren't going to find any shelter in the First Amendment,'' said
Howard Siegel, an attorney for the families.
Paladin Press, based in Boulder, Colo., plans to ask the full 4th
Circuit to review the panel's decision and will seek a Supreme Court
review if necessary, said Lee Levine, the publisher's attorney.
The appeals court ''did not sufficiently take into account the First
Amendment implications of holding the publisher of a book legally
responsible for actions of someone reading the book,'' Levine said.
The lawsuit was supported by victim rights groups, while The
Washington Post Co., The New York Times Co. and other media
organizations filed briefs supporting Paladin's position.
In 1996, U.S. District Judge Alexander Williams ruled that the
victims' families could not hold Paladin liable because of the First
Amendment's guarantee of free speech.
The appeals panel sent the case back to Williams for trial.

@_subject: Politically Correct Riding Hood 
Author Unknown (to me at least) but it fits in well with our current
discussion of how not to offend various minority groups.
There once was a young person named Little Red Riding Hood who lived
on the edge of a large forest full of endangered owls and rare plants
that would probably provide a cure for cancer if only someone took the
time to study them.
Red Riding Hood lived with a nurture giver whom she sometimes referred
to as "mother," although she didn't mean to imply by this term that
she would have thought less of the person if a close biological link
did not in fact exist.
Nor did she intend to denigrate the equal value of non traditional
households, although she was sorry if this was the impression
One day her mother asked her to take a basket of organically grown
fruit and mineral water to her grandmother's house.
"But mother, won't this be stealing work from the unionized people who
have struggled for years to earn the right to carry all packages
between various people in the woods?"
Red Riding Hood's mother assured her that she had called the union
boss and gotten a special compassionate mission exemption form.
"But mother, aren't you oppressing me by ordering me to do this?"
Red Riding Hood's mother pointed out that it was impossible for womyn
to oppress each other, since all womyn were equally oppressed until
all womyn were free.
"But mother, then shouldn't you have my brother carry the basket,
since he's an oppressor, and should learn what it's like to be
And Red Riding Hood's mother explained that her brother was attending
a special rally for animal rights, and besides, this wasn't
stereotypical womyn's work, but an empowering deed that would help
engender a feeling of community.
"But won't I be oppressing Grandma, by implying that she's sick and
hence unable to independently further her own selfhood?"
But Red Riding Hood's mother explained that her grandmother wasn't
actually sick or incapacitated or mentally handicapped in any way,
although that was not to imply that any of these conditions were
inferior to what some people called "health".
Thus Red Riding Hood felt that she could get behind the idea of
delivering the basket to her grandmother, and so she set off.
Many people believed that the forest was a foreboding and dangerous
place, but Red Riding Hood knew that this was an irrational fear based
on cultural paradigms instilled by a patriarchal society that regarded
the natural world as an exploitable resource, and hence believed that
natural predators were in fact intolerable competitors.
Other people avoided the woods for fear of thieves and deviants, but
Red Riding Hood felt that in a truly classless society all
marginalized peoples would be able to "come out" of the woods and be
accepted as valid lifestyle role models.
On her way to Grandma's house, Red Riding Hood passed a woodchopper,
and wandered off the path, in order to examine some flowers.
She was startled to find herself standing before a Wolf, who asked her
what was in her basket.
Red Riding Hood's teacher had warned her never to talk to strangers,
but she was confident in taking control of her own budding sexuality,
and chose to dialogue with the Wolf.
She replied, "I am taking my Grandmother some healthful snacks in a
gesture of solidarity."
The Wolf said, "You know, my dear, it isn't safe for a little girl to
walk through these woods alone."
Red Riding Hood said, "I find your sexist remark offensive in the
extreme, but I will ignore it because of your traditional status as an
outcast from society, the stress of which has caused you to develop an
alternative and yet entirely valid world view. Now, if you'll excuse
me, I would prefer to be on my way."
Red Riding Hood returned to the main path, and proceeded towards her
Grandmother's house.
But because his status outside society had freed him from slavish
adherence to linear, Western-style thought, the Wolf knew of a quicker
route to Grandma's house.
He burst into the house and ate Grandma, a course of action
affirmative of his nature as a predator.
Then, unhampered by rigid, traditionalist gender role notions, he put
on Grandma's nightclothes, crawled under the bedclothes, and awaited
Red Riding Hood entered the cottage and said,
"Grandma, I have brought you some cruelty free snacks to salute you in
your role of wise and nurturing matriarch."
The Wolf said softly "Come closer, child, so that I might see you."
Red Riding Hood said, "Goddess! Grandma, what big eyes you have!"
"You forget that I am optically challenged."
"And Grandma, what an enormous, what a fine nose you have."
"Naturally, I could have had it fixed to help my acting career, but I
didn't give in to such societal pressures, my child."
"And Grandma, what very big, sharp teeth you have!"
The Wolf could not take any more of these specist slurs, and, in a
reaction appropriate for his accustomed milieu, he leaped out of bed,
grabbed Little Red Riding Hood, and opened his jaws so wide that she
could see her poor Grandmother cowering in his belly.
"Aren't you forgetting something?" Red Riding Hood bravely shouted.
"You must request my permission before proceeding to a new level of
The Wolf was so startled by this statement that he loosened his grasp
on her. At the same time, the woodchopper burst into the cottage,
brandishing an ax.
"Hands off!" cried the woodchopper.
"And what do you think you're doing?" cried Little Red Riding Hood.
"If I let you help me now, I would be expressing a lack of confidence
in my own abilities, which would lead to poor self esteem and lower
achievement scores on college entrance exams."
"Last chance, sister! Get your hands off that endangered species! This
is an FBI sting!" screamed the woodchopper, and when Little Red Riding
Hood nonetheless made a sudden motion, he sliced off her head.
"Thank goodness you got here in time," said the Wolf. "The brat and
her grandmother lured me in here. I thought I was a goner."
"No, I think I'm the real victim here," said the woodchopper. "I've
been dealing with my anger ever since I saw her picking those
protected flowers earlier. And now I'm going to have such a trauma. Do
you have any aspirin?"
"Sure," said the Wolf.
"I feel your pain," said the Wolf, and he patted the woodchopper on
his firm, well padded ass, gave a little belch, and said, "Do you have
any Maalox?"

I would think that with all the recent publicity about the IRS abusing
citizens, limited only by the agency's creativity and its ability to
select citizen-units preceived as unable to fight back, that we should be
able to spin the Jim Bell case in a way which further damages the public
image of the IRS.
After all, the IRS is hardly the agency charged with discovering alleged
plots to overthrow the government, and the fabrication of such a plot in
order to harrass and imprison a tax protester would seem to constitute
antics similar to those disclosed in recent Congressional hearings. Of course, it would be difficult to wash away all the FUD the government
has disseminated about the Bell case by now.  Still, I think sloshing the
IRS with a bit of the excrement they have been dispensing to the press
might not be a bad move.  Perhaps a noisy statement about the Bell case at
one of those public meetings the IRS has been commanded to hold to discuss
its past abuses might be a good place to start.

Two more future cypherpunks added to the list of people who will someday "McVeigh" Washington, DC.
I'm surprised sending a flame to one of our elected leadership's public email addresses is not already a death penalty offense. CORDOVA, Tenn. (AP) -- Two 13-year-old boys are charged with sending a
threatening e-mail message over the Internet to Hillary Rodham
Contents of the electronic mail message to the president's wife
haven't been released, but U.S. Secret Service agents are expected to
outline them during a hearing Monday in Juvenile Court.
The youngsters, whose names have not been released, are charged with
threatening and harassing Mrs. Clinton. They could face a fine,
counseling, community service or detention.
Officials say it's unlikely that the president's wife read the
message, which was sent last month.
Anyone with a computer, modem and an Internet service provider can
access the White House Web Page and Mrs. Clinton's E-mail address.
Her page includes photos, a biography, speeches and instructions on
sending an electronic message.
``The Internet is a wonderful tool that not only enables you to better
access information about the White House, but also gives us an
opportunity to hear your ideas and better serve you,'' Mrs. Clinton
says in the welcoming text of her Web page.
Senders must include a name, address and other information about why
they're writing. All senders receive an electronic message
acknowledging receipt of the e-mail.
It was not clear whether the boys included their own names and
addresses, but authorities say tracing e-mail is relatively easy.
``We aggressively investigate any threats or incidents of unusual
interest toward any of our protectees,'' said Steven Rutledge,
special agent in charge of the Secret Service in this area.
Cordova is about 15 miles east of Memphis.

BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) -- Secret Service agents searched the apartment
of a University of California student newspaper columnist who wrote a
satirical attack on Chelsea Clinton, the writer says.
Guy Branum, a columnist for the Daily Californian, said agents
searched his off-campus apartment Monday, the same day Chelsea
Clinton's mother, Hillary Rodham Clinton, visited the university for a
meeting on foster care. Chelsea Clinton is a freshman at rival
Stanford University.
The Secret Service office in San Jose refused to comment or confirm
Branum's account. A White House spokeswoman also would not comment.
The agents checked for weapons, Branum said Tuesday. They also had him
sign a release giving them access to his medical records, he said.
``They wanted to make sure there wasn't anything that would
demonstrate mental instability on my part,'' he said. ``No pictures of
Chelsea with X's through them or something like that.''
He said he gave two agents permission for the search after they
threatened to detain him while getting a search warrant if he didn't.
Branum said his column, which appeared Thursday, was meant to be
satirical. It was intended to rally spirit before the UC-Stanford
football game.
In the column, Branum revealed which dormitory Chelsea lives in and
 ``Show your spirit on Chelsea's bloodied carcass, because as
the Stanford Daily (newspaper) lets us know, she is JUST ANOTHER
``She embodies the Stanford ethos of establishment worship that must
be subverted and destroyed,'' the column continued. ``Is hate a strong
word? Yes. Is it applicable? Certainly.''
The newspaper apologized Friday for undermining a ``student's physical
safety'' and its own reputation.
Stanford went on to beat UC, 21-20, in Saturday's game.
Branum said the agents who searched his apartment lectured him about
the column and about a previous column in which he referred to the
president as ``Sexual Predator in Chief.''

Actually, it's the credit card issuer who eats it.  The issuer guarantees
the merchant payment as long as the charge is approved at the point of
sale. This is why merchants almost never care who or what presents the
card, as long as the card is valid.
The actual owner of the card is also protected against having to pay
fradulent charges, as long as he informs the card company in a timely
manner if the card is lost, stolen, or misused.
The cost of guaranteeing any valid card is as good as cash to the
merchant, and holding the consumer harmless for fraud, is born through
fees and interest on card balances, and merchant fees for processing
credit card transactions. Of course, the attitude of "why should I care if my card is used
fradulently, I won't have to pay" raises credit card costs to everyone, as
the card companies simply recycle the added expense back to their
customers. You may recall a recent news story in which someone collected a huge

Five years after the US military murdered thousands of Panamanian
civilians, and bulldozed their bodies into mass graves prior to
the arrival of the press, the US is again demonstrating its
unmitigated arrogance on the world scene by staging a show trial
of a Panamanian citizen accused of killing a US soldier.
Jury selection began Tuesday in the trial of Pedro Miguel
Gonzalez, the son of a prominent Panamanian politician.
Gonzalez, who was at a demonstration protesting Bush's impending
visit, denies any connection to the incident in which a US
vehicle was sprayed with gunfire.  He has been in hiding since
the 1992 incident, fearing he could not get a fair trial from the
US-installed Panamanian government.
At the time, the US government promptly termed the killing of the
US soldier a "terrorist act", and offered a $100,000 reward for
the identity of the perpetrators.
The pretense for the US invasion, and subsequent massacre, as
announced on television by President Bush, was that Panamanian
soldiers had kicked a US soldier who had run a roadblock.  The
hidden agenda was retaining US control over the Panama canal
after it appeared relations between the US and Panama might turn
sour.  In addition to killing thousands of civilians, the US also
kidnapped Panama's President, Manual Noreiga, and convicted him
in the United States of various vague drug-related charges, after
installing a regieme sympathetic to the United States.
Gonzalez faces 20 years in prison if convicted.

The facts are that a 15 year old exploring his gay sexuality entered into
a long term relationships with an older guy he met on a chat line. Cops entrapped the younger one in a child porn sting, seized his hard
drive, bugged his phone, and tried to force him to incriminate his friend. He finally got pissed, smashed the recording machine, told his friend what
was going on, and suggested the cops fuck themselves. His parents and the cops then tried to have him declared insane and
institutionalized, which didn't work.  They also immediately arrested his
friend.  The cops working on his case then phoned the team investigating
the murder of the younger boy, and gave his name to them as a suspect.  He
was then arrested and jailed for that murder, although no direct evidence
linking him to the murder has been released. The boy's parents have now embarked upon a nationwide crusade claiming
that their "rights" were violated because laws do not allow the parents of
a minor to institutionalize him at will.  They have signed a legal waver
of their child's right to privacy in order to facilitate this crusade, in
spite of the fact that he will likely be tried as an adult and this will
undoubtedly prejudice his trial.
Meanwhile, the parents have not let these minor tribulations mess up the
their heavy schedule of lavish vacations and casino gambling. The press continues to harp on the "murder suspect was abused"  and
"parents rights foiled by the system" aspects of the case, to the
exclusion of the possibility that he is only in jail because the police
wanted to screw him, or that the murder was committed in a blind fit of
rage as a result of his manipulation at the hands of various authority
figures. Somewhere in all of this is the truth, which will no doubt unfold as all
these scenarios play themselves out.

No relationship at all, except for the fact that the police "Harold"  told
to fuck off called the team investigating "Norbert's" death and told them
"Harold" would make an excellent patsy, being in an illegal homosexual
relationship with an older man and excellent media fodder.
I suppose, but it does seem that the only time young people get adult
rights awarded to them is when adults want to punish them for something.
Here we have a 15 year old, having a clandestine relationship with an
older friend.  He lets something slip to a therapist, who immediately
declares that the boy has no right to privacy, and communicates his
confidential medical files to the local prosecutor.  The cops accost him
in his home, take his computer hard drive, and install bugging equipment
all over the place and demand he participate in an elaborate entrapment
scheme, or they will screw him royally. He finaly gets up enough courage to say "NO" to the cops, and his parents
then drag him to various places where they try and get various people to
sign papers committing him to a mental institution, including a degrading
hearing in which a judge makes smug remarks about corporal punishment,
declares he is "just a kid" with no rights, and suggests that family
problems are a result of kids taking advantage of their parents niceness. Oh - his older friend is also arrested, and charged with every imaginable
sex crime, and held without bail. Failing to get him committed, the police then contact the team in charge
of the murder investigation of the uninvolved third party, and give them
his name as a suspect, whereupon he is promptly arrested and jailed
without bail as well. His parents lawyer then signs away all his rights to confidentiality, and
his parents start a media campaign about how the "system" let them down,
because they couldn't just get him locked up anytime they demanded.
Add to the insult the years of taunting he endured in school because he
was gay, and it probably isn't beyond the realm of possibility that he
caved someones head in with the nearest rock.  Of course, it would have
been nicer if he had terminated his parents and half a dozen jackbooted

RAINBOW CITY, Ala. (AP) -- Officers who went to a house with a
warrant to search for drugs were met at the door by a couple in
bulletproof vests and a surprise gunfight.
A blast from an assault weapon, apparently fired through the
front door, killed Chris McCurley, 46, the recently appointed
chief of Etowah Country's drug task force, authorities said.
Etowah County Sheriff James Hayes said a man and woman came to
the door wearing bulletproof vests when law officers arrived
Friday at their new house in a quiet neighborhood near the Coosa
River about 65 miles northeast of Birmingham.
After McCurley was shot, the man walked outside and continued
firing, striking three more officers before he was finally shot
down by police hiding behind trees, said Minnie Bellew, who lives
across the street.
Ezra George Petersen, 50, was hospitalized with minor gunshot
wounds to his extremities, Hayes said. He was under guard at
Gadsden Regional Medical Center. The woman, Connie Stozzie, 30,
was taken to jail and was on investigative hold.
Petersen shot at officers with an AK-47 assault weapon with a
100-round drum of ammunition, Hayes said.
Officer Gary Lee Entrekin, 34, was in serious condition with a
gunshot wound to the back, said M.D. Garmon, a spokesman at
Riverview Regional Medical Center in Gadsden.
Altoona police officer Khris Yancey, 26, was shot in the back,
but his wounds were not thought to be serious. Reserve officer
Rick Correll, 46, was in fair condition with wounds to an arm and
``The law enforcement community and its supporters will not rest
in this county until Petersen gets what he justly deserves -- and
that's the electric chair,'' Hayes said.
Neighbors said the tall, tattooed Petersen was a friendly man
frequently seen riding a motorcycle. He had bought $20 worth of
oranges Wednesday from Mrs. Bellow's grandson, who was selling
fruit for a school fund-raiser.
``He was real nice. I talked to him about his motorcycles, all
the stuff he did to them,'' 14-year-old Jake Bellew said.

I've just uncovered a massive plot to destroy our nation's
competitiveness and inculcate its young people in the
collectivist mentality.
The tool?  Youth sports!
This morning's AP wire reports that two football coaches are
suing a youth football league after being banned for life because
their 11 and 12 year old players won by too large a point spread.
Apparently, and I find this truly shocking, it is a common
practice in youth sports today to have a rule limiting the number
of points by which a game may be won, with horrendous sanctions
for violating it.  Winning by more than that, it is argued, is
"demoralizing" to the other team, and (Gasp!) UNETHICAL!
Once the designated point spread is reached, coaches must order
their players to deliberately lose, play badly, and act retarded.
I became aware of this idiotic practice after I mentioned the AP
article to several people, and rather than throwing up their arms
in horror, they volunteered that their own local teams had such
rules as well.
It's time to check closely, to make sure such shenanigans are not
afoot in your town, polluting the entrepreneurial spirit of your
very own children.
Imagine if Ross Perot had played on such a team, or Bill Gates,
or Adolf Hitler?  The entire course of history might have been
FRIENDSWOOD, Texas (AP) -- Two volunteer coaches are taking a
youth football league to court after they were banned for life
because their 11- and 12-year-old players couldn't resist playing
After the Sagemont Cowboys destroyed the Friendswood Chiefs 62-0
on Oct. 4, the Bay Area Football League banned twin brothers Roy
and Rene Aguilar -- whose team has dominated the league for
several years.
``They're saying that because we demoralized the other team and
that we are teaching the kids unethical practices that we're out
for life,'' Rene Aguilar, the team's assistant coach, said in
Wednesday's editions of The Galveston County Daily News.
The league has a rule that prohibits teams from winning by more
than 42 points. The Aguilars say they told the team to slow down
after building a 42-0 lead, but the players couldn't help scoring
The Friendswood Chiefs, named after this Houston suburb, fumbled
the ball in their own end zone and Sagemont recovered to increase
its lead to 48-0. Rene Aguilar said the coaches tried to tell the
players not to recover the fumble.
``That's confusing to them,'' he said. ``One minute we're trying
to tell them to play hard, then we're telling them to lay down.''
Recovering that fumble, according to a league rule, meant a
one-game suspension for the head coach and a $100 fine for the
Rene Aguilar said the Sagemont club president was at the game and
told the coaches to handle the situation however they saw fit.
``So we played the rest of the game because we already knew we
were going to be penalized,'' he said. The Cowboys went on to
score another 14 points.
League officials met two days later and gave the Aguilars a
lifetime ban. A judge granted the Aguilars a restraining order to
prevent the ban from taking effect, but the order expires Friday.
The Aguilars met with the league officials late Wednesday for
private mediation in an effort to avoid a court hearing Friday.
``We're not allowed to discuss what went on,'' Peggy Bittick, the
coaches' attorney, told The Associated Press late Wednesday.
``We're going full force to court.''
Calls to league officials were not returned.
Ms. Bittick said she watched a videotape of the game and it
appeared that Friendswood was not trying to recover the fumble.
``It looked like the other team just threw up their hands and
gave up.''

Didn't the feds raid some company right here in Texas a while back,
called NetPics, for providing decoded Usenet pictures via a Web
interface?  As I recall, NetPics got raided even though they tried to
filter out child porn, and had all of their equipment seized.
One hesitates to even think of what the feds will do to someone who is
deliberately offering only decoded boysex newsgroups over the Web, but
it will undoubtedly involve sharpened castration shears and lots of
really bad publicity.
Providing the Feds haven't already taken it over, killed everyone
associated with it, and decided to run it as a sting.
Of course, this is an interesting legal question.  Clearly, offering
raw Usenet content the ISP doesn't originate absolutely shields the ISP
from responsibility for the material, under current telecommunications
The unanswered legal question is whether processing the raw news feed
in some way, such as would be needed to provide web access to decoded
pictures, also enjoys the same protection.
It would seem that automatic transcoding of Usenet, in a way which is
not content sensitive, should not be considered the origination of new
content.  On the other hand, the Feds are hardly going to sit still
for a URL which, when clicked upon, fills ones browser screen with
hundreds of thumbnails of blond pre-teen Scandinavian boys in

Apparently, US Customs doesn't even need a warrant to detain you for days
without the opportunity to talk to an attorney, x-ray you, pump your
stomach, give you laxatives, chain you to a hospital bed, or insert their
arms up to the elbow in one of your body openings. Are laws of other Western nations similar?  While I can understand
strip-searching travelers on occasion, the rest of this stuff seems a tad
much, especially in the absense of anything resembling due process.
Declan didn't write this, so I will post the whole thing. :)
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Returning to Chicago from Jamaica, Gwendolyn
Richards was plucked from a line of air travelers by a Customs Service
inspector and ordered into a bare, windowless room. Over the next five
hours, she was strip-searched, handcuffed, X-rayed, and probed
internally by a doctor.
The armed Customs officers who led Richards in handcuffs through
O'Hare International Airport and drove her to a hospital for
examination suspected she might be smuggling drugs. They found
``I was humiliated -- I couldn't believe it was happening,'' said
Richards, who is black and has joined a civil rights lawsuit against
Customs. ``They had no reason to think I had drugs.''
Richards, 27, isn't alone.
Officers last year ordered partial or full strip searches or X-rays
for 2,447 airline passengers, and found drugs on 27 percent of them,
according to figures compiled by the Customs Service.
Customs officials say tough tactics are necessary to catch the growing
number of smugglers who swallow cocaine-filled balloons, insert
packages of heroin into their body cavities, even hide drugs in a
hollow leg or under cover of a fake pregnancy.
``We still have a major drug problem in this country,'' Customs
Commissioner Raymond Kelly said in an interview Wednesday. ``We have
to do this.''
Richards and others who have sued Customs have alleged they were
targeted because of their race. Sixty percent of those pulled aside
last year for body searches or X-rays were black or Hispanic, Customs
figures show. Thirty-three percent of Hispanics who were searched were
found to have drugs compared with 31 percent of blacks and 26 percent
of whites.
Kelly said race isn't a factor. ``There are higher risk countries and
higher risk flights,'' he said. ``Those flights may be more populated
by a particular ethnic group.''
Last year, the Customs Service seized 858 pounds of cocaine and 803
pounds of heroin attached to or inside international air travelers'
bodies, officials said. More than 70 percent of the heroin seized at
airports was smuggled that way.
Acknowledging that searches ``can get pretty traumatic,'' Kelly said
Customs is reviewing its policies and experimenting with new
technology that might reduce the number of body searches. The review
comes after several lawsuits and complaints from travelers who say
they suffered abusive treatment and hours of confinement. For
--A Florida mother says her baby was born prematurely because Customs
officials forced her to take a prescription laxative when she was
seven months pregnant. In a lawsuit filed last month, Janneral Denson,
25, said she was taken from the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood
International Airport and shackled to a hospital bed for two days so
inspectors could watch her bowel movements. She says her son, born 12
days later, suffered damage.
--Two Jamaican-born U.S. citizens each filed a $500,000 claim in
September over body cavity searches and X-rays in Tampa, Fla. One of
the women learned afterwards she was pregnant and agonized that her
fetus might have been harmed, according to their attorney, Warren Hope
Dawson. The baby was born healthy. Customs policy requires a pregnancy
test before a woman is X-rayed, but Dawson said the pregnant woman was
not tested.
--A 51-year-old widow returning from an around-the-world trip was held
for 22 hours at a San Francisco hospital, x-rayed and given the same
powerful laxative. Amanda Buritica of Port Chester, N.Y., won a
$451,001 lawsuit last February. A Boston nurse, Bosede Adedeji, won
$215,000 in a similar lawsuit in 1991.
Customs officials note that fewer than 2 percent of the 68 million
fliers who pass through Customs each year have their luggage opened.
Far fewer -- about 49,000 people -- are personally searched, usually
with a pat down.
The 1,772 strip searches last year ranged from people told to remove
their socks to passengers like Richards who were ordered to take off
their underwear and bend over. Strip searches are performed by
officers of the same gender.
The Customs review found 19 passengers who were subjected to pelvic or
rectal exams by doctors while inspectors watched. Drugs were found in
12 of those cases.
Congress and courts have given Customs broad authority to search for
drugs, weapons and other illegal imports.
The Supreme Court ruled that Customs officers at airports and border
crossings don't need the probable cause or warrants that police need
to search possessions. Customs officers can perform a strip search
based on ``reasonable suspicion'' that someone might be hiding
something illegal.
A Customs handbook obtained by The Associated Press advises officers
that reasonable suspicion usually requires a combination of factors,
including someone who: appears nervous, wears baggy clothing, gives
vague or contradictory answers about travel plans, acts unusually
polite or argumentative, wears sunglasses or acts sick. Race isn't
Customs officers can detain people for hours, even days, without
allowing them a telephone call to a lawyer or relative or charging
them with a crime. Inspectors say they keep detainees from making
calls so that drug associates aren't tipped off. Generally, if someone
is detained for eight hours or more, a federal prosecutor is notified.
Richards is among more than 80 black females who filed a class-action
lawsuit claiming they were singled out for strip searches at O'Hare
because of race and gender.
The plaintiffs include a 15-year-old girl, a mentally retarded woman,
and a woman who uses a wheelchair. Many decided to sue after seeing
news reports on Chicago's WMAQ-TV about strip searches of black women.
The agency has hired an outside contractor to review how inspectors
deal with the public, and is exploring ways to make the system less
hostile. In a test at Miami and New York airports, some passengers
selected for strip searches are given the option of having an X-ray
instead. The service is also studying new imaging technology that
shows things hidden under people's clothes.
Customs officers seek passengers' written consent for an X-ray, but it
isn't required. Some travelers say they felt coerced.
Las Vegas police officer Rich Cashton said a Customs inspector who
stopped him at Los Angeles International Airport last year grew angry
when Cashton asked what would happen if he refused an X-ray.
``He said, 'If you don't sign this form, I'm going to take you down to
the hospital and pump your stomach,'' Cashton recalled. ``He was using
that threat as intimidation to make me sign a consent form, which is
definitely illegal.''
Cashton, who identified himself as a police officer, was let go.

Could someone (other than Jim Choate) explain the mechanism behind the
Aharonov-Bohm effect, where a quantum field propagating via two distinct
paths finds its wavefunction phase shifted by the amount of magnetic flux
enclosed, even if it is completely shielded from the magnetic field, and
traverses only regions of space where B=0.
This has apparently been experimentally verified, and is a leading
candidate for reading the state of quantum dots.

Why do I find this odd?  Because the electromagnetic field acts
locally, the vector potential is not directly observable and depends
on ones choice of gauge, and wavefunction phase is also not directly
observable.  The integral of the vector potential around the closed
path is of course well-defined, but this is global, not local.
So it seems strange, and hints at some sort of "action at a distance"
thing occuring.  The wavefunction is being perturbed according to the
magnetic flux enclosed by a path, even while propagating in a region
distant to the flux which contains no electromagnetic field at all.
It still seems counterintuitive to suggest that I can make a tour
around a magnetic field an arbitrary distance away, and get a precise
reading of its strength.  Would it work a mile away?  A light year
away?  Does this result follow from QED?  Some equations might be

The beautiful results from two types of experiment that were claimed
to confirm the existence of the (misnamed) Aharonov-Bohm Effect, with
coherent electrons in split beams (Tonomura amp; co.) and split
conductors (Webb amp; co.), are explained quantitatively by the energy
of interaction of the magnetic field produced by the moving electrons
with the magnetic flux of the adjacent applied field. The electron
velocities (and phases) change by opposite amounts in the two parts of
the split beam, and de Broglie wave interference occurs in the
rejoined beam. No effect of a magnetic vector potential in the absence
of a magnetic field has been demonstrated, so the ESAB Effect has not
been demonstrated to exist.

Another point to consider is that a company sponsoring a contest,

interest in measuring the state of existing relevant art, and almost
no interest at all in directly funding new research leading to the
destruction of its cipher.
Most such contests have very carefully structured rules, and prizes
that are not too large, to sample what current tools and algorithms
can do, without single-handedly funding expeditions into unexplored
Factoring contests are a good example of this, where you get a few
thousand dollars for breaking something slightly larger than the last

dancing factoring algorithm of the future, and breaking the 500

Exactly.  Contests do nothing in the absence of prior academic

highlight what already exists.  Contests do not drive research, nor do

POMONA, Calif. (AP) -- Hundreds of people were quarantined for hours
inside a nightclub after a phony anthrax threat, at least the seventh
such hoax in Southern California this month.
No trace of the potentially deadly bacterium was found in preliminary
tests, authorities said Sunday.
A Los Angeles County hazardous materials team and the FBI's Domestic
Terrorism Task Force were called to the Glass House club at 11:50 p.m.
Saturday after a man called the Police Department and said ``a
significant quantity'' of anthrax would be released into the air,
police Lt. Gary Graham said.
If inhaled and then left untreated, anthrax spores can cause
respiratory failure and death within a week.
About 800 people were kept inside the club for about four hours while
the air-conditioning system was checked and samples taken for further
study, Graham said.
Clubgoers then were taken outside and given information on anthrax
symptoms. They were then allowed to return to the club if they wished.
Authorities had not immediately determined whether the threat was
related to six others since the middle of the month. In each case, no
evidence of anthrax was found:
--On Dec. 14, a secretary at the Perris School District in Riverside
County opened a letter that said, ``you've been exposed to anthrax.''

In a further blatant erosion of Constitutional rights, the California
Supreme Court has ruled that a person owing child support who fails to
seek or accept work may be jailed and fined for contempt of court, and
that this does not violate any Constitutional bans on involuntary
servitude or imprisonment for debt. This reverses nearly a century of contrary rulings.  Look for this
"improved" interpretation to be expanded to other kinds of debts and
judgments as well, as soon as massive public acceptance of it for the
carefully picked child support issue is engineered. The credit card companies are no doubt carefully analyzing this decision

BONN, Germany (AP) -- Germany reduced constitutional guarantees of privacy
Friday to fight organized crime, ceding historical concerns over past
dictatorships to present-day realities. By a one-vote margin, parliament's upper house approved changes to the
constitution necessary for eventual passage of a law allowing electronic
surveillance in private households. Before approving the measure, however, the opposition Social Democrats won
a promise that a parliamentary committee would re-examine the proposed law
to include protection for some groups -- including journalists, doctors
and some lawyers. The proposed law has raised warnings about reviving the police state
tactics of the Nazi regime and former communist East Germany. Mostly,
though, critics are worried about breaching confidentiality essential to
some professions, such as doctors. Outside of government, journalists and doctors have been the most vocal
critics of the draft law, which currently shields conversations between
suspects and clergy, parliamentarians, and defense lawyers. Journalists view the proposed law as an attack on press freedom. ``It's not about privilege for journalists,'' the chairman of the German
Journalist Association, Hermann Meyn, wrote in an open letter to
parliament. ``It's about protection of news room secrets, essential press
The vote Friday weakened the constitutional guarantee of the sanctity of
ones home by defining situations when police could bug homes:  during
investigation of serious crimes -- such as murder, kidnapping, extortion,
arms and drug trafficking -- with the approval of three judges. The changes necessary for the law also would allow electronic
eavesdropping on suspects after a crime has been committed -- not just to
prevent crime -- and for the first time allows information from bugging
devices to be entered as evidence. Organized crime has risen sharply in Europe since the collapse of
communist regimes in Russia and Eastern Europe, which loosened previously
closed borders. Drug trafficking, car theft and smuggling of cigarettes,
illegal immigrants and even nuclear material has increased. The law must be passed by both houses of parliament.

Now that the Feds have gotten the Horuichi case moved out of state
jurisdiction into a federal courtroom, they want their federal judge
to dismiss all charges.
BOISE, Idaho (AP) The federal government on Monday sought the
dismissal of a state involuntary manslaughter charge against the FBI
sharpshooter who killed Randy Weaver's wife at Ruby Ridge six years
The Justice Department petition filed in federal court argued that Lon
Horiuchi was protected by the Supremacy Clause of the U.S.
Constitution so he cannot be subject to state prosecution for actions
in the line of duty.
"It is imperative that federal officials be protected from state
prosecution in such circumstances because without the protection
ensured by the Supremacy Clause, rigorous enforcement of federal law
would be severely chilled to the detriment of the general public
good,'' the petition said.
Horiuchi was among dozens of federal agents who surrounded Weaver's
remote mountain cabin in the Idaho Panhandle in August 1992 in an
attempt to arrest Weaver on an illegal weapons charge.
Weaver's 14-year-old son, Sam, and deputy U.S. Marshal William Degan
of Quincy, Mass., were killed in the gunfight that touched off the
11-day siege. Vicki Weaver was fatally shot by Horiuchi on the second
Both Randy Weaver and family associate Kevin Harris were acquitted in
1993 of federal murder and other charges in connection with the siege.
Weaver was also acquitted of the weapons charge that had prompted
federal agents to confront him.
Last August, five years to the day after Mrs. Weaver's death,
prosecutor Denise Woodbury filed the involuntary manslaughter charge
against Horiuchi. The Justice Department had earlier declined to
prosecute Horiuchi.
The prosecutor also charged Harris with murder in Degan's death, but
that charge was dismissed on a double-jeopardy ruling.
On Jan. 7, U.S. District Judge Edward Lodge moved the case to federal
court. Horiuchi pleaded innocent. His trial is scheduled for March 10.

NEW YORK (AP) -- Two members of the Aryan Nation have been arrested in

subways, an FBI source said today.
The source, who spoke in New York on condition of anonymity, provided
no other details. The Aryan Nation is a white supremacist group.
The FBI in Nevada said that two men were taken into custody in a
luxury car outside a doctor's office in Henderson, Nev., near Las
FBI spokesman Aurelio Flores in Las Vegas said only the matter was
``serious.'' He said different teams from around the country are
``coming in to look at what we have.''
A news conference was set for late morning Las Vegas time.
Flores said the FBI has secured the area where the car was found and
had ``made everything safe.'' He said the agency was not looking for
The New York source said the suspects allegedly planned to release a
``dangerous bacterial substance'' in the subways.
In Washington, a federal law enforcement source said agents were
investigating allegations that the two men arrested in Las Vegas
possessed anthrax. The source stressed that the tests were not
complete and that there have been unfounded instances in the past
involving allegations of anthrax.
Anthrax is an infectious disease that usually afflicts only animals,
especially cattle and sheep. But Anthrax spores can be produced in a
dry form suitable for weapons and can be fatal to humans even in
microscopic amounts.
New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani was briefed on the case by FBI
Director Louis Freeh and was told ``there is no reason for alarm,''
said mayoral spokeswoman Cristyne Lategano. She would not confirm what
the alleged threat was.
Giuliani, speaking generally about the threat of terrorism, said:
``Every part of America, every part of the world, is vulnerable to
terrorism. ... There is no way to make an open society, a democracy,
invulnerable to terrorism or to criminal acts. Short of closing down
America and closing down the city of New York, it would be impossible
to do that.''
The mayor added, ``It is impossible to have a police officer every
place. That would be unrealistic, and it would change the nature of a
free society. Short of that, I think New York City is doing everything
it can do to try to reduce the risk.''

expect from a professional babykiller.

worthy of further discussion.

foreign soil, and to refuse orders which conflict with whatever
remaining conscience you have.  If you join, and you go over there,

The FBI was awaiting tests Friday to determine if it was vaccine or

``When he couldn't scam 'em, he went the other way. He became a good

Leavitt's business lawyer, Kirby Wells, said the machine was called
the AZ-58 Ray Tube Frequency Instrument Prototype, and was hyped by
Rockwell in glossy brochures as being able to flush the body clean of
bacteria and viruses.
``It looked like a bunch of bells and whistles,'' said Wells, who said
he saw a picture of the machine. ``What made my client believe there

Leavitt believed that Harris was transporting anthrax vaccine, Mills

On the''NBC Nightly News'' Friday, Rockwell reiterated that Leavitt

``They lied on what they were going to do,'' Rockwell said. ``It

There is no phone listing for Rockwell in the Las Vegas area. His
attorney has not returned calls to The Associated Press.
Leavitt and Harris were arrested Wednesday night after the FBI, with
Rockwell's help, tailed the men to a medical office in suburban
Henderson. Authorities removed a cooler and petri dishes from the
office, and sealed the men's beige Mercedes in plastic before
transporting it to an Air Force base.
Leavitt, 47, and Harris, 46, of Lancaster, Ohio, are being held
without bond.
In an affidavit, the FBI said described Rockwell as a cancer research
scientist who was convicted of felony extortion in 1981 and 1982. But
the FBI has vouched for his credibility, saying he came forward
without getting a deal and was a ``citizen performing his civic

The FBI has said Harris met Rockwell last summer at a Denver science
conference, while Leavitt's attorneys said they believed Rockwell got
the men together.
Mills said the results of the FBI tests will determine if they remain
united in their defense. ``If the tests come back non-toxin, there is
no case,'' said Mills. ``If it comes back military grade, then whoa,

BOSTON, Mass. (AP) - Sen. Ted Kennedy announced here today that he
will introduce a bill limiting access to skis and ski poles. The
"Winter Sports Safety Bill" is believed to be a reaction to the recent
death of the Senator's nephew Michael Kennedy in a skiing accident.
"When skis were invented, they were made out of wood," Kennedy said.
"Today's skis are simply to powerful and dangerous to be in the hands
of people. There is no constitutional right to skiing. We feel that
people will have to sacrifice some of their freedoms for the
protection of society as a whole."
One provision will license all dealers in skis. These licenses will
involve fingerprinting, background checks, body cavity searches, and
photographs of anybody wishing to be in the business of selling skis
and ski poles.
Another section of the bill bans any ski pole under 36" in length and
any ski which is not at least 48" in length.
The bill also addresses ski wax. Studies have shown that some waxes
actually make the skis go faster, creating a greater danger of death
to the skier. Skiers also use the faster skis to outrun the ski
patrol, which is not an acceptable practice.
A five day waiting period will be required for all ski and ski pole
sales.  People will be required to provide their social security
number and floor plan of their homes before being permitted to
purchase skis.
"There are simply too many people getting excited about skiing. Easy
access to skis is the major reason people get killed on those things.
They should have to wait before they can pick up their skis. I am sure
that this 'cooling off period' will save lives," Kennedy said.
Another bill has been introduced that will ban 'ski carrying devices'
on tops of cars that have a capacity of greater than ten skis.
"There is simply no reason why anybody needs more than ten skis. You
can't ski on more than two at the same time. People with more than ten
skis are simply up to no good," said Kennedy.
Statistics quoted by the Center for Disease Control show that skiing
was second only to drowning as the leading cause of death for people
close to the Kennedy family.

Could someone poke through Lotus Notes with a debugger and see exactly how
this "giving 24 bits to the government" is implemented? Most commercial software simply introduces redundancy in order to limit
the keyspace to 40 bits, regardless of the advertised length of the key. This claim that they deliver 64 bits of key to the customer seems a bit
bogus. Of course, they could have done something clever, like generating a
completely random 64 bit key, and then encrypting 24 bits of it with a
giant government-owned RSA public key, and including this additional
information with each message.  However, it seems unlikely that they would
employ such strong encryption for message recovery, while offering only 64
bits for message encryption. Is Lotus Notes encryption documented anywhere?  Are the differences
between the export and domestic versions disclosed to overseas customers?

To follow up my prior message...
I managed to find a document entitled "Security in Lotus Notes and the

It describes the weakening procedure as follows.
  "No matter which version of Notes you are using, encryption uses the
   full 64-bit key size. However, the International edition takes 24 bits
   of the key and encrypts it using an RSA public key for which the US
   National Security Agency holds the matching private key. This
   encrypted portion of the key is then sent with each message as an
   additional field, the workfactor reduction field. The net result of
   this is that an illegitimate hacker has to tackle 64-bit encryption,
   which is at or beyond the practical limit for current decryption
   technology and hardware. The US government, on the other hand, only
   has to break a 40-bit key space, which is much easier (2 to the power
   of 24 times easier, to be precise)."

The manslaughter case against Ruby Ridge shooter Lon Horiuchi was
effectively neutered today when a federal judge acquiesed to demands

tried in federal court in front of a federal jury on state
manslaughter charges, and not in front of a jury from Idaho's Boundary
County, where the shooting took place.
This ruling, by U.S. District Judge Edward Lodge, came just six days
after Boundary County Magistrate Quentin Harden ordered Horiuchi to
stand trial.  State manslaughter charges had been filed against
Horiuchi for the death of Vicki Weaver in August.

LONDON (AP) -- It's a briefcase even James Bond could love.
Britain's more adventurous Cabinet ministers soon will be spiriting
laptop computers inside their signature ``Red Box'' briefcases,
complete with fingerprint recognition systems and silent alarms.
The stacks of papers, briefing documents and constituency
correspondence that now go home with each minister in lead-lined red
briefcases will be replaced in a few months by a specially designed
super-secure laptop -- capable of carrying infinitely more homework.
At $4,000 each, the prototypes unveiled Tuesday are seen as a symbol

billed as a way to make government work more efficiently.
They will not, however, be foisted on ministers who prefer the
old-fashioned paper route -- but those holdouts will miss an
electronic voice that chirps ``Good morning, minister'' each time the
computer is turned on.

No ``top secret'' documents will be loaded on the computers because
such material is seldom transmitted electronically for security
reasons, a government spokeswoman said.

Steve Schear writes"
Think of the classical case.  I bake two fortune cookies, one with
"FOO" written on the slip of paper inside, and the other reading
"BAR." I then put them in a box and shake it for quite a while, until
the final state has chaotic dependence upon initial conditions, and
cannot be predicted.  I then keep one fortune cookie, and mail the
other one to Lucky Green in Tonga.
Someday in the future, I open my cookie, and instantly know what Lucky
will see when he opens his.  In doing so, I have created a
"instantaneous" correlation between two things separated by a vast
distance, which were in an identical state of ambiguity prior to one
of them being examined.
I am sure we will agree that there was no genuine faster-then-light
communication of information in this case.
In quantum mechanics, pairs of observables may have the property that
both of them may not be known precisely for a physical system.  The
Heisenberg Uncertainty principle states this for position and
momentum. Similar relationships exist for energy and time,
polarization or angular momentum measured with respect to different
axes, and various other things.  In addition, measuring a physical
system for one such variable always changes its wavefunction into one
for which the value of that variable is precisely specified, and the
value of the other "non-commuting" variable is not.
You can see this easily with three polarizing filters.  If you shine a
light through two of them at right angles to each other, it will be
completely blocked.  But it you insert third filter at a 45 degree
angle, some light will get through.  This is because light whose
polarization is known to be vertical or horizontal is in a mixed state
with respect to its polarization rotated 45 degrees.
It is therefore tempting to think that perhaps the miracle of quantum
mechanics could be employed in our fortune cookie experiment for the
transmission of information.  I generate many pairs of cookies, with
random but identical polarization, keeping one of each pair for
myself, and sending the other to Lucky.  I then encode a stream of
bits by measuring the polarization of 100 cookies, vertically if I
wish to transmit a "0", and at a 45 degree angle if I choose to
transmit a "1".  I then know Lucky's corresponding cookie to be in an
exact state with respect to one of these observables, and in a mixed
state with respect to the other, and if Lucky measures the vertical
polarization of his groups of cookies, there should be a correlation
between his results and mine which can only be explained by non-local
communication of my choice, on the fly, of which way I measured the
polarization, to his apparatus.
Now here we have good news and bad news.  The good news is that when
we do such an experiment, precisely enough to know for sure that there
is a spacelike separation between the two measurement events, we do
indeed see the correlation predicted by quantum mechanics.  The bad
news is that either end of the experiment, by itself, cannot see this
correlation without knowing what results were obtained by the person
at the other end. The correlation is between both ends.  There is no
experiment that can be done by either end alone which will turn out
differently depending upon what the guy at the opposite end is doing.
Thus, while such experiments involve non-local communication between
two locations separated by a spacelike distance, such communication is
obvious only to someone able to see what is going on in both places at
once, but not to either isolated experimenter. Hence, the non-local
collapse of quantum mechanical wavefunctions cannot be employed for
the transmission of information.
A similar argument applies to quantum teleporation, in which the value
of some measurable variable is transferred from a dynamical system to
one of two particles in correlated but unknown quantum states, causing
the particle's twin to take on an identical value.  Again, a person
able to view both systems can see that non-local communication has
taken place, but there is nothing either end can do by itself to learn
what has transpired at the other end.  This is because the correlation
which proves non-local communication is present only in combined data
from both ends of the experiment, but not in data from either end

While it is true that my examining my cookie does not force Lucky to
examine his, the same can be said of a photon experiment, where the
photons can remain in flight for an arbitrary period of time before
being measured.  However, if there is no spacelike separation between
the two measurments, one has not proved non-local collapse.
The state of the cookies is highly correlated, since they have
opposite values.  The polarization of the photon pairs is similarly
correlated, as they have equal values.
And indeed in the photon case, the entanglement exists when two
photons with correlated wavefunctions are created.
Nope.  Destroying one of a pair of entangled photons does nothing to
the other.  Just like the cookies.  It's just that measurements on
both photons may be correlated in a way which would seem to suggest
non-local collapse of their combined wavefunction, if a choice of
which of two non-commuting observables to measure is done on the fly.
But if I give you one of a pair of entangled photons, I can't make
anything happen to that photon at a distance that you can detect by
doing something to my photon, even though measurements done on both
photons may show a correlation which implies non-local collapse.
Not at all.  Position and momentum are like location and frequency of
a wave.  A pure sinusoidal wave exists everywhere on the t axis, and a
function whose support is confined to a small region is a
superposition of a whole range of frequencies.  I cannot make a
waveform which is non-zero simultaneously in an arbitrary small
portion of the both the time and frequency domains.  Similarly I
cannot construct a quantum mechanical wavefunction which is confined
to an arbitrarily small portion of the position and momentum domains.
This does not mean that position and momentum are different aspects of
some other dynamical quantity.  Both position and momentum are
fundamental dynamical variables, in and of themselves.
Circularly polarized light is simply a superposition of vertically and
horizontally polarized light of different phases.  It has no magical
ability to make it through two polarizing filters set at 90 degrees to
each other.  (This is an experiment *YOU* can perform at home!)

No.  Doing something to the first photon does not do anything to the
second, much less change its polarization.  The operators for
polarization for the two photons commute, so they are simultaneously
The statistical correlation of measurements done on many pairs of
photons, with a choice of axis for measuring the polarization selected
on the fly, reflects that predicted by quantum mechanics for non-local
collapse of the overall wave function.  It is wrong to interpret this
as something done to one photon having a physical effect on the other.
Sorry, *OUR* physics explains all of this quite nicely.
This isn't even wrong.
There is no "swap of polarizations." The wavefunction of the entire
system changes quite smoothly with time, under the influence of the
usual operator.  Measurement places the system in an eigenstate for
the thing measured, and simultaneous measurements on branch systems
may show correlations consistant with non-local collapse of the
wavefunction.  None of this implies any physical effect on one photon
as a result of something done to the other.
This isn't even wrong, either.

With correlated branch systems, examination of one branch can disclose
information about another branch which is currently distant from us.
This is no more weird in the quantum mechanical case, than it is in
the classical case.  The envelope analogy is perfectly appropriate.
That's not to say that quantum mechanical systems aren't "weird" in
ways that classical systems are not.  It's just that this is not one
of those areas of weirdness.
The wavefunction of the universe is not a physical observable.  I do
not have to sacrifice causality for physical phemonema to have
non-local collapse of the wavefunction when measurements are
performed.  A satisfactory theory of quantum mechanical measurement
does not currently exist, and it has even been conjectured that
gravitation may be the sole force immune from quantum mechanical
superposition, and that this may be the mechanism behind wavefunction
collapse.  There are other hypotheses as well, and the experiments to
distinguish amongst them have yet to be performed.
A correct theory of quantum mechanical measurement will disclose the
mechanisms by which things like non-local wavefunction collapse,
quantum teleporation, the quantum eraser effect, and other current
oddities are mediated.  This will undoubtedly involve a deeper
understanding of how quantum gravity works, and perhaps even the
physics underlying the existence of consciousness itself.
However, none of this implies in the least that a physical effect is
propagated non-causally across vast distances when a conscious choice
is made to measure one of two non-commuting observables for one of a
pair of "entangled" particles, which, I believe, is what the current
argument is over.

The states are no more "co-dependent" than two copies of the same book
at different locations on the planet are.  The primary difference in
the quantum mechanical case is that because of superposition, each
might be a mixed state of several books, and only the act of measurement
would disclose which one, and that a decision to examine one of
several non-commuting observables might be made after the books had
been produced and were in transit.  This would *NOT* imply in any way
that examination of one book had any physical effect on the other,
although correlation of measurements made on both books might
demonstrate non-local collapse of the QM wavefunction, which is not,
and never has been, a physical quantity.
I can think of even a more extreme case.  Suppose I have the same
Barium atom in two laser traps tuned to different excited states and
separated by a distance of 1,000 miles.  I now have a 50/50
superposition of one state here, and a different state 1000 miles
Even with the *SAME* particle in two different places, nothing I do to
it in one place is detectable by a scientist in its other location,
and the only correlations which demonstrate non-local effects require
data from measurements from both of them.

While the US Government tries to whip up public opinion for the mass
murder of more Iraqis, filling the press with inflammatory statements,
most of which are based on no new information, and the inability to
prove negatives, newly declassified records demonstrate that such
antics have been used by the government before.
Should the US, claiming to represent "the will of the whole world,"
launch an unprovoked military strike against Iraq, based on some vague
claim that Iraq has not had its industrial infrastructure disemboweled
to the point where it will never again be able to perform even the
simplest chemical or biological laboratory work, I would hope that all
thinking non-sheep in this country would avail themselves of every
covert opportunity to monkey-wrench the US War Machine.
UN economic sanctions demanded by the US against Iraq have already
directly resulted in the deaths of over 1,000,000 Iraqis of all ages.
WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's military leaders signed off on a scheme
in 1963 to provoke Fidel Castro into attacking the United States so
that retaliating U.S. forces could squash him ``with speed, force and
determination,'' newly declassified records show.
The records were among 600 pages opened at the National Archives by a
government agency, the Assassination Records Review Board, to help
researchers into John F. Kennedy's Nov. 22, 1963, assassination
explore the possibility of a Cuban connection and to ``put the
assassination into its historical context.''
Some Cuban involvement has been theorized because of slain suspect Lee
Harvey Oswald's association with the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.
``These military records further demonstrate how high on the U.S.
government's radar screen getting rid of the Castro government was in
the early 1960s,'' said John R. Tunheim, a federal judge in Minnesota
and the board's chairman.
The documents showed that in February 1962 the Joint Chiefs of Staff
and Deputy Defense Secretary Roswell Gilpatric approved a plan to
``lure or provoke Castro, or an uncontrollable subordinate, into an
overt hostile reaction against the United States.''
The attack ``would in turn create the justification for the U.S. to
not only retaliate but destroy Castro with speed, force and
determination,'' the memo said.
It was not clear where along the chain of command the plan eventually
was squelched.
But by the following year, another Pentagon policy paper discussed a
new scheme to make it appear that Cuba had attacked a member of the
Organization of American States so that the United States could
Five scenarios were spelled out, foreseeing either real or faked Cuban
attacks on a U.S. ally.
One of them: ``A contrived 'Cuban' attack on an OAS member could be
set up, and the attacked state could be urged to take measures of
self-defense and request assistance from the U.S. and OAS.''
The paper expressed confidence that ``the U.S. could almost certainly
obtain the necessary two-thirds support among OAS members for
collective action against Cuba.''
The planners got cold feet, the documents show. They feared leaks.
``Any of the contrived situations described above are inherently,
extremely risky in our democratic system in which security can be
maintained, after the fact, with very great difficulty,'' a memo said.
``If the decision should be made to set up a contrived situation, it
should be one in which participation by U.S. personnel is limited only
to the most high trusted covert personnel.''
The documents were the second set about Washington's preoccupation
with getting rid of Castro to be made public by the board. Late last
year, 1,500 pages showed that military planners had come up with a
variety of dirty tricks intended to harass or humiliate Castro.
One prescribed flooding Cuba with faked photos of an overweight Castro
``with two beauties'' and ``a table brimming over with the most
delectable Cuban food'' to make the point that Castro's lifestyle was
richer than that of most Cubans.
In the new set of papers, one prepared by the Defense Department's
Caribbean Survey Group and dated Feb. 19, 1962, wanted to make Castro
so fearful of an imminent U.S. attack that he would call up the Cuban
militia. The purpose was ``a complete disruption of the available
labor force'' for the 1962 sugar cane harvest.
Another, a psychological warfare proposal dated Feb. 12, 1963,
proposed the creation of an imaginary Cuban resistance leader. The
paper called him ``our Cuban Kilroy.''
``After a period of time, all unexplained incidents and actions for
which credit has not been seized by some other exile group would
automatically be ascribed to our imaginary friend,'' the paper said.
``At some point in time it could be leaked that the U.S. is, in fact,
supporting this imaginary person.''
Eventually, the paper speculated, ``a member of the resistance in Cuba
may gain sufficient stature to assume or to be given the title of this
imaginary leader.''
The Pentagon documents were written after the disastrous April 1961
invasion of Cuba's Bay of Pigs by Cuban exiles trained, armed and
directed by the United States.

Judicial rulings notwithstanding, a description of that which is now known
as RSA Public Key Cryptography was published in a book of algorithms which
pre-dated by quite a few years its patenting and commercial promotion by
the current patent holders.  That exponentiation modulo the product of two
distinct odd primes was not easily reversable given knowlege of the
modulus and the exponent was hardly a closely guarded mathematical secret,
even decades before this fact was employed by cryptographers. All of this was extensively discussed here on Cypherpunks back when
disputes over the RSA patent were newsworthy, and I suggest you grep the
archives for more specifics. My point was that the US is one of the few countries to permit the
patenting of abstract mathematics, albeit it under the guise of some
practical "method and apparatus" jargon.  The fact that the patent
couldn't be successfully challenged even though its mathematical
underpinnings were well known years prior reflects badly only upon the
notion of mathematical patents, and hardly refutes the facts in evidence. Again, (patent not invalidated) != (no prior art)
But then, I'm sure you knew that. One "foo on that" at the notion of patenting mathematics in general, and
of patenting ciphers employing data dependent rotates in particular,
hardly constitutes hooting and sneering directed at Ron Rivest, whose work
is greatly respected in the cryptographic community.
But then, I'm sure you knew that too. I'm also pleased to report that the DES Analytic Crack Project is plodding
along towards its goal of an algebraic inverse to DES. While the project will generate $10k in sponsorship money when fully

as quite a few potential sponsors have indicated an interest in seeing
some preliminary research results prior to remitting funds. Since we are not hurting for funds at the moment, we have decided to
devote 100% of our effort to the project at this time, and will probably
not have a further "pledge break" until 8-round DES bites the dust. Then
we will try to get the project fully subscribed, do the 16-round crack,
and write up the final report.

Vin McLellan, apparently not satisfied with only one flame, makes this
response to a very conveniently appearing anonymous remailer troll
saying something silly about Matt Blaze:
Here the disingenuous Vin gives his own description of my prior post,
which he then proceeds to loudly refute, and I certainly didn't use
the word "identical" or the word "equivalent." I stated that
descriptions of "that which is now known as RSA" have appeared in
print, and that the one-way characteristics of the RSA trap-door
function were also previously known.
The arguments for invalidation of the RSA patent were based on two
central claims.  First, that work which contained similar material was
distributed by preprint and presented at conferences more than one
year before the RSA patent was applied for.  This would include the
Diffie-Hellman paper on "Multiuser Cryptographic Techniques", the
early Merkle-Hellman work, and the Pohlig-Hellman work.
The second claim that may be made against RSA is that the system is
"obvious." Support for this claim may be found in books dating all the
way back to the 19th century which discuss both the cryptographic
usefulness of one-way functions, and the factorization of the product
of two primes as one example of such a function.
Quoting "Cyberlaw":
    "There are a number of references in the prior art, moreover,
     to using the problem of factoring composite numbers in
     cryptography, dating back to the 19th century.
    "In 1870, a book by William S. Jevons described the
     relationship of one-way functions to cryptography and went
     on to discuss specifically the factorization problem used
     to create the "trap-door" in the RSA system."
Only a complete moron would place himself in the position of trying to
prove such an all-encompassing negative.
If you had correctly read the FAQ, you would see that we have 5
sponsors, and 15 open sponsorships.  We are not stimied, we are
writing and debugging many thousands of lines of extremely complex
code, and do not wish to be distracted by further marketing activities
at this time.

This concludes my response to Vin, who may now return to his regularly
scheduled trolling lessons.

made no claims about any of the prople working on it, other than that
they are competent implementors of complex algorithms.  Matt Blaze is
not associated with the project, and if any other crypto notables wish
a similar public statement made about them, they have only to email
and request it.

statement of work in the FAQ, and work product to date.  They are not
being solicited based on any representation that various individuals
with recognizable names are associated with the project.  Anonymous
trolls making such allegations, followed by irate rebuttals by shills,
and scientists who should know better, are clearly an attempt at
disruption.  Continued such antics will be met with an appropriate

Vin has now cloned his vigorous defense of the RSA patent to several
Usenet newsgroups, posting his "summary" of the discussion.
Sternlight now leaps in, to add his two cents worth.
Good morning, David.  We've missed you on the Cypherpunks List. No, David.  Vin's argument is that since the patents were upheld in court,
no knowlege of the specific algorithms or methods used to construct the
patented entity pre-dated the work which led to the patent. In point of fact, such things do not automatically invalidate patents. Certainly the concept of trapdoor functions, their cryptographic utility,
and that multiplication of primes was such a function, were known prior to
the development of the RSA Public Key Cryptosystem.  I vaguely recall that
encipherment by modular exponentiation has also been published as an
algorithm, albeit prior to the recognition that it had utility in
constructing public key systems. Certainly the notion that the difficulty of factoring composites could
be employed in the construction of cryptographically useful things was
prior art.  The description of encryption by modular exponentiation I recall would have been additional prior art. There is a huge difference between "prior art" and "invalidating prior
art" under patent law.  Indeed, to invalidate the patent, it would have
been necessary not only to find a description of the mathematical methods
used in the construction of the RSA algorithm, but also a claim for the
specific use for secure communication over insecure data links. Some of Cylink's points were factually accurate.  A system which permits
the patenting of applied mathematics, which many engineers could have
independently derived, is hardly likely to stun us with a brilliant
interpretation of the various shades of meaning surrounding such claims
and counterclaims. Again, losing in court does not equate to ones facts being in error, any
more than it equates to the mathematics being patented being unknown prior
to their incarnation in the patented application.
RSADSI's aggressive litigation posture discouraged people from ignoring
their patent, and given that the patent could be licensed for much less
than a lengthy court fight, kept litigation to a minimum.  Cylink was
pretty much the sole exception to this, and that was a legal fight
internal to PKP.
Yes, David.  Practically anything can be patented.  The power of patents
is in defending them, not in applying for them, or in receiving them.
Well, that depends on how you define bogus.  I consider patenting applied
math to be bogus.  Your mileage may vary. Someone who responds to a one line comment about the mathematical
underpinnings of RSA being previously known, with several multipage essays
whose central thesis is that such a claim cannot possible be true, because
the patent would have been invalidated by the courts, is a troll who
either understands nothing about how patents work, or is blowing a foghorn
on behalf of the patent holder.
Vin has already outed himself as someone who has done work for RSADSI.  He
has vociferously defended various key recovery schemes implemented in
their products against critics.  This, combined with his rabid insistance
that the RSA patent is something novel and unique, does equate to what
some of us might describe as a "vested interest" in the matter, directly
funded or not. Patent examiners generally rely only upon the material presented with the
patent application when reviewing it, and expect people to do their own
searches, and correctly cite related patents.  Litigation is generally the
means by which patents are challenged, not by the patent office refusing
them, except in extrordinary circumstances, perpetual motion machines
being one well-known example. I merely asked if Vin intended to bill them for the time he spent
writing his rants.  A rhetorical question. Suggesting that I would have to retire my nym after criticizing the RSA
patent and taking several pages to say a paragraph of material certainly
qualifies as a tirade in my book, especially when combined with a lot of
irrelevent innuendo unrelated to the topic being discussed.
To an economist, perhaps.  It would be more accurate to say that demand as
a function of whether such features are included is a pretty flat
function. Your point here eludes me.
And you usually do, and on, and on, and on...
I simply believe that patents on applied math are inappropriate.  Given
that they are allowed, it seems silly to cite the fact that the courts
uphold them as evidence for anything, particularly claims that they are new, novel, and non-obvious.

to be upheld by the courts.  Whether any of this is "wrong" in some
abstract sense is a religious debate, in which I am uninterested.
Let us examine the two statements:
 I.  Certainly, given what was known at the time widespread
     data communications created a commercial demand for
     secure communication over insecure lines, a person
     setting out to create a software solution to the
     problem, knowing what was then known about
     cryptography, trapdoor functions, and other techniques,
     would almost certainly have employed modular
     exponentiation or discrete logs to solve the problem.
     If RSA hadn't been patented at the time it was, it most
     certainly would have been independently discovered by
     multiple individuals and widely employed, without the
     present licensing restrictions.  Prior published works
     on cryptographic trapdoor functions involving the
     factoring of composites and possibly even encryption by
     modular exponentiation existed long before the RSA
     patent.
II.  Obvious prior art sufficient [in the current regulatory
     environment surrounding patents in the US] to
     invalidate the RSA patent in court has never been
     published.
Now, given that these two statements are not opposites of each other,
one is not going to refute the first by stating the second, no matter
how big a bullhorn one employs.
I have only argued that obvious prior art exists.  I have also stated
that I would favor a regulatory climate in which such obvious prior
art would preclude a patent being granted.  I have never stated that
we currently live in such a regulatory climate.  In fact, we do not.
Many words, like "prior art," have specific legal meanings which
differ from their common English usage.  Kind of like economists
arguing that there is no "demand" for food by poor people, because
they have no money with which to purchase it.  I use the term "obvious
prior art" to mean prior publication of the essential methods and
techniques with which a technically skilled person, given the same
problem to solve, would arrive at the same or a similar solution.
Put two graduate students at opposite ends of a wire, with the world's
prior-to-1977 writings on cryptography, trapdoor functions, the
intractablity of factoring the product of primes, and the modular
exponentiation problem.  I suspect the RSA Public Key Cryptosystem
would not be long in emerging, even if one employed particularly dense
graduate students.
That is what I mean when I use the term "obvious prior art."
I was proceeding upon the assumption that the enumerated "points" you
claimed I was making were ones with which you disagreed.  If that is
not the case, I am prepared to declare early victory.
"Nobody could afford to litigate [against RSADSI]" is misleading, as
even the wealthy don't employ the expensive option, when a cheap one
is available.  Besides, I have never contested that the current
regulatory climate supports the patenting of things like RSA even in
the presence of prior publication of the essential mathematical
There were plenty of companies who had the financial power to squash
RSADSI like a grape, and probably change the regulatory climate as
well.  There was no incentive for them to do so, and they probably
have applied mathematical patents of their own which they are fond of.
Had RSADSI sat on the patent, and refused to license it to others,
both they and their patent would probably have had a very short life
Yes, the "method and apparatus" transformation.
They rarely litigate patents where the cost to litigate is enormous,
the technology may be cheaply licensed, and the chances of success, or
of even trying to explain the topic to the average layman, are
Well, I suppose Vin could just be a bored essayist in need of
something to practice on.  (Snicker)
I think you are having some difficulty separating out the sarcasm
here.  Besides, the suggestion that Vin has a vested interest in
defending the RSA patent hardly translates into an assertion that
everyone who disagrees with me on some subject is someone's paid
Abstraction from the specific to the general is not an accepted tool
of inference.
You, for instance, are probably quibbling for entirely different
That sometimes happens when one party "summarizes" a flame war, and
posts it elsewhere.  Deal.
"Practically anything" is not unequivocal, and is a correct
description of the current patent review climate.
Vin alleged that RSA being granted a patent proffered compelling
evidence of the unique worth of the thing being patented.  It is
correct to apply general comments about the patent-granting climate to
this specific case.  For a better example of confusing generals and
specifics, you may re-read your own comments on "if someone opposes
me, someone must be funding them" above, incorrectly abstracting my
comments about Vin to the general population. :)
Bzzzzzzzz. Wrong Answer.
And we will have to deduct additional points for abstracting again
from Vin to the general population vis a vis "Security Dynamics is
paying for those who opppose me."
The best you can get on this mid-term is now a C. :)
Most of the factual material refuted nothing I was claiming, and
refuted things I wasn't claiming, such as Jevon's book containing a
complete description of PKC, as opposed to being the earliest known
work which contained something related to the topic.
Again, an attempt to impress people with the volume of the evidence,
rather than with its quality, which when combined with the occasional
snide remark, meets my definition of "tirade."
His post is discredited because it fails to address any of my points
about the RSA patent, and instead argues forcibly for a collection of
self-evident surrogate issues, carefully selected for their ability to
be easily confused with the real ones.
"Demand" in common English usage means that something is being
clamored for.  In Economic terms, it means half of the phrase "supply
and demand" which is something entirely different, said economic
demand existing for anything which is purchased.
I believe that surveys by privacy groups long ago showed that GAK/Key
Escrow/Key Recovery was not being clamored for by corporate America,
although attempts were being made to incentivize it by the
intelligence and law enforcement communities.
I was using "demand" in its ordinary English usage.  You were using it
as an economic term, in an attempt to call the mere fact that GAK/Key
Escrow/Key Recovery-enabled software was purchased at all "demand" for
it.  Which, to use one of Clinton's favorite phrases, was "technically
accurate, although misleading."  :)
Uh, no.  That was definitely not what I was saying.  I don't think it
is what you are trying to say either, but thanks for using "1-1" and
"onto" in a sentence about functions.
That would kind of depend on how "X" was priced, would it not?  If you
give things away for free, people will probably take one in case they
need it someday, as it costs them nothing.
This does not equate to "demand," or "clamoring."
Hint:  It's not quite English.
That's one possible explanation.  To test your hypothesis, we should
see how well Vin's agreement tracks RSA's inclusion of additional
encrow/GAK/recovery features in the future.  He may have to change the
name of "The Privacy Guild" to something less impressive.
I'm sure you've been attacked before, by people a lot less nice than
myself. :)
Hmmm.  Well, patents on pure math are not allowed, ergo, math must
be suitably transformed in order to be patented.
There is a fundamental difference between telling me I cannot practice
modular exponentiation to communicate with people without licensing
it, and telling me I cannot make RDRAMs without licensing that.
I am unlikely to replicate the RDRAM design by accident.  I am quite
likely to derive a given bit of mathematics given the application for
If RSA can be patented, why not something like Householder transforms,
or cluster analysis, or the quadratic formula?  Sounds like the
slippery slope to me.
There is a fundamental difference between a physical machine whose
design required the use of mathematics, and an abstract mathematical
transformation, which may exist only in an instance of some computer
program performing a certain task.
Again, returning to the top of our discussion, the existence of
"obvious prior art" for RSA in the common English sense meaning of
"obvious prior art" has little to do with whether patents are upheld
in the current regulatory climate in the United States.
It would be simple to test your hypothesis, by simply giving trapdoor
functions replete with useful identities to two people, and telling
they have to construct a common secret unknown to a third party
monitoring their communication.  I cannot imagine a technically
skilled person taking very long to make the transition from some
"one-way" functions, to a practical implementation of D-H, RSA, or
That would be my definition of "obvious."

their doors in the dead of night.
The suspects range from a high school teacher to a 15-year-old boy to

On the night of the Sept. 3 raids, Kennebunk police and Customs
authorities crept up to Mr. Nighbert's home and peered through a back

Mr. Nighbert was charged with possession of child pornography, a

New York State Attorney General Dennis Vacco, who is running for
re-election, is crowing and posturing this morning over having seized
two ISPs, Dreamscape in Syracuse, and Buffnet in West Seneca, over the
content of the newsgroup alt.binaries.pictures.pre-teen, thus making a
small dent in the distribution of "filth" to ignorant citizen-units.
A running gag in abpep-t for the last several years has been for
newsgroup posters to identify themselves as various faculty belonging
to a mythical "Pedo University" when responding to trolls.  Vacco
believes this imaginary organization to be a "International Child
Pornography Ring" which he has broken up.
13 individuals in various countries were also arrested on various
child pornography possession, trading, and promotion charges, related
to activity in the newsgroup, and 34 are still under "investigation",
according to this morning's AP wire.
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.pre-teen continues merrily onwards, and
is presently discussing the arrests and seizures, minus a few of its
regular participants.
While the loss of two small ISPs and a dozen or so patrons is unlikely
to bring the uncensorable worldwide Usenet to its knees, this appears
to be a small first step towards eroding the legal notion that common
carriers are immune from liability over Usenet content.
  NEW YORK (AP) -- Authorities say they have broken up an

@_subject: Usenet Under Siege 
Interesting developments in the election year attempts by New York
State Attorney General Dennis Vacco to create legal liability for ISPs
over Usenet content, particularly alleged child porn.
Over the past few years, a number of national news providers, under
pressure from various self-declared "child advocates," have filtered
out articles from their feeds whose newsgroup names suggested that
depictions of the sexuality of minors were topical.
Given that Usenet routes around censorship, that a "newsgroup" is not
a tangible entity, but simply one line on a Usenet article which
attempts to roughly categorize it, and that the Usenet newsgroup
namespace is practically infinite, such attempts to curtail the topics
discussed in the worldwide real-time conversation that is Usenet have
been laughably unsuccessful.
While uncensored Usenet feeds are still the standard most customers
demand, this content-based pruning of the daily newsfeed by some ISPs
has provided the opportunity for some in law enforcement to
characterize uncensored news servers as some sort of outlaw minority.
Law enforcement is now trying to use such representations as a
pretense to erode the notion that ISPs should enjoy common carrier
status for content they do not originate.
It therefore came as no surprise when Dennis Vacco, the incumbent New
York Attorney General, and an individual who has built his reputation
with numerous publicity stunts revolving around sexual vices featuring
those under the legal age of majority, seized the news servers of
Dreamscape and Buffnet in a highly publicized raid, accompanied by
simultaneous press releases and Web pages, announcing that he had
broken up an "International Child Pornography Ring." 13 individuals in
several countries were also arrested on various possession,
trafficking, and promotion charges involving illegal erotica.
The fallacies in Vacco's spewage were innumerably large.  There was
the absurd idea that a running gag in one newsgroup involving a
mythical "Pedo University" indicated the existence of a "virtual
academic institution devoted to the sexual abuse of children." Vacco
also seemed to believe that individual Usenet newsgroups were owned
and operated by specific individuals, and that certain newgroups were
"providing services" to the aforementioned imaginary academic
In reality, no one owns or operates a Usenet newsgroup, and any
individual may post anything he likes to any newsgroup at any time,
either anonymously, or with identifying information attached.
Dennis Vacco's clueless attack on the global Usenet may in fact
backfire, as there is presently serious discussion over a possible
three day protest, in which all traffic destined for the groups
targetted by Vacco will be posted instead to alt.law-enforcement.
Vacco's plans to undermine claims of common carrier status for ISP's
can be found in his following statements.
     "Most Internet service providers choose not to carry
      news groups that cater to the interests of child porn
      traffickers for obvious reasons.
     "Those that do are well aware of their nature and
      purpose, possess the offensive images on their servers,
      and facilitate the transfer and trading of child
      pornography."

further information on the attempts to criminally charge ISPs over
Usenet content, available on their web site.
ISPs may face charges over child porn
By Paul Festa
Staff Writer, CNET News.com

A few exerpts...
    As many as five Internet service providers may face
    serious legal charges for providing access to
    newsgroups used by child pornographers in cases that
    critics are calling election-eve politics.
    New York Attorney General Dennis Vacco won praise this
    week for his role in an international crackdown on an
    online child pornography ring. But critics have accused
    Vacco, up for reelection Tuesday, of breaking the law
    and playing politics in probing two New York state ISPs
    as part of the crackdown and seizing their newsgroup
    servers.
    Three more ISPs--two on the West Coast and one in the
    Midwest--are likely to receive search warrants in
    coming weeks, the attorney general's office told CNET
    News.com today.
    ...
    Law enforcement officials have not arrested or charged
    anyone affiliated with the ISPs. But the businesses,
    which provided access to the newsgroups, are under
    investigation for what Vacco's office describes as the
    knowing possession of criminal images.
    "The servers were confiscated as part of ongoing
    investigation," said Marc Wurzel, spokesman for the
    attorney general. "The ISPs were in possession of
    illegal images of children engaged in sex acts. In both
    cases, they were forewarned that they were in
    possession of illegal images."
    The notification came in the form of an email inquiry
    sent by an undercover agent. The agent posed as a
    student wanting to know whether he would run afoul of
    the law by downloading child pornography he had found
    through the newsgroups.
    A third New York ISP, located in Albany, responded to
    the undercover inquiries by suspending the newsgroups.
    As a result, that ISP is not under investigation,
    Wurzel said.
    ...
    Coincidentally, Congress recently passed the Child
    Protection and Sexual Predator Punishment Act, which
    would make ISPs responsible for turning in their
    customers. Under that legislation, access providers who
    fail to report child pornography once they are made
    aware of it could be fined up to $50,000 for the first
    violation and up to $100,000 for each subsequent time
    they fail to contact law enforcement authorities.
    ...
    Vacco has pulled ahead in what only a few weeks ago
    was a tight race for reelection. In a New York
    Times-CBS poll taken in the first week of October,
    Republican Vacco and Democratic opponent Eliot Spitzer
    were statistically tied in their race for the state's
    top law enforcement spot. According to a Times-CBS poll
    released this week, Vacco is now ahead, 48 percent to
    36 percent, with 14 percent of the voters undecided.

@_subject: The DES Analytic Crack Project 
As some of you may have noticed, a new attempt to crack the Data
Encryption Standard has been started, with a descriptive FAQ located
at the following URL
        A while back, after the first DES challenge was announced, a number of
us made the observation that a known plaintext attack on DES,
expressed as a system of a few thousand boolean variables with
constraints in 3-conjunctive normal form, was not too far from the
size and complexity of problems that could be directly solved by
bleeding edge combinatorial algorithms, albeit with signficant CPU and
memory consumption.
We thought this would be an interesting result, and generated a number
of problems of various numbers of DES rounds based on the DES
Challenge data, and some not particularly optimized S-Box
representations, and set about the task of solving them, smaller
problems first.  We wrote a lot of code, learned a lot about arbitrary
systems of boolean variables, and after breaking 2-round and 4-round
problems, the first almost instantly, and the second with very
reasonable amounts of resources, set about the task of seeing if we
could break the higher round problems, and immortalize ourselves by
beating DESCHALL to the key.
To our very great regret, we did not manage to do this, and once the
$10k prize was claimed, we figured the game was over and returned to
working on other things.  We still thought DES was a problem of
approximately the right size to demonstrate the existence of an
analytical solution which would beat a well-tuned exhaustive search on
a problem of practical interest.
Since that time, DES has been broken twice more by exhaustive search,
once by distributed.net, and again by a hardware DES cracking machine
designed by Net legend John Gilmore and the EFF for a non-trivial
amount of money.
Remarkably, although most agree DES is dead for new applications, with
Moore's Law and additional hardware crackers being possible today for
much less than the cost of the prototype, it still seems to enjoy a
reputation amongst the public as a cipher that takes 20,000 pentiums
running for half a month or a hardware box with $100k of chips running
for several days to break, neither of which seems to have thrown the
Fear of God into its current users, most notably the Banking Industry.
With other analytic attacks like differential and linear cryptanalysis
being really practical only for reduced round DES, and all current
high-profile cracks on production ciphers employing key trial, the
press has latched onto keysize as a synonym for strength, and has made
numerous statements which have reinforced this questionable paradigm
in the minds of the public.
We have therefore been taking another look at our idea of a
combinatorial crack of DES, and decided that even with DES having been
cracked three times by key trial, it is definitely a project worth
doing.  This time, rather than working frantically in an unsuccessful
attempt to beat other teams on a public challenge, we wish to finish
up our original efforts, and repeat the three cracks previously done,
this time using our algorithms, and distribute working code
continuously as the project progresses, to sponsors who have donated
some money to defray our costs.  This will offer people the
opportunity to participate vicariously in a fun project which has the
potential to be a genuine paradigm shift in the way the world thinks
about codebreaking.
Sometimes, promising areas of research are not followed because of
knowlege of some well-known result which suggests that such
exploration will be unfruitful.  Years ago, for instance, suggestions
that programs could be checked by software for proper behavior, and
run without using protected memory regions, were usually met with
snide comments about the "computer halting problem" and various
adjunct results.  Today, there are many variants of "safe execution"
technology, from prove and carry schemes, to Java bytecode, with a
sound theoretical basis behind them.  None of these is a violation of
the "computer halting problem" results, of course.
Similarly, after a large burst of activity decades ago, which resulted
in the notion of NP-Completeness, and various results in computational
complexity theory, suggestions that an analytic solution exists for
some large combinatorial problem of practical interest conjure up
visions of exponential resource utilization, speaker cluenessless, and
the lack of progress on NP=P.
For this reason, we feel this project is definitely a Schnelling
Point.  If it works, even badly, people will begin to look at lots of
problems in ways they would not have considered before, and much new
code which improves upon what we have done will be created.  This will
be an irreversible change in the Order of Things.
In the several days since we put up our FAQ, we have gotten quite a
few comments, and some concerns.
The comments have mostly been along the lines that it is an
interesting, even intriguing project.  The concerns are generally that
we will experience an unexpected "combinatoric explosion" in the
higher round problems, and that no one in their right mind would send
money to a nym, because it might just vanish and be used by the nym to
live in perpetual ecstasy in some place warm and tropical, without the
possiblility of the nym being sued for fraud.
We hope the close coupling between the sponsors and the project
members will eliminate this latter concern, with weekly progress
reports and working code being distributed to permit the sponsors to
reproduce our results as they occur.  If three people are willing to
sponsor and give us the go-ahead to begin, without wanting their money
back if other sponsors do not join, we can probably get through the
minimal S-Box representations and their proof-of-correctness as well
as some cleaned up code for the 2-round problem.  Hopefully we will
then have a reputation with these people which will encourage others
to join in the effort.
Clearly, we're after speculative capital, rather than widow and orphan
money, and hope a few of the wealthy older retired (and perhaps even
crusty) engineer types might find this a productive thing to support.
After all, if you've just blown $220,000 on a DES Cracker, making it
$220,500 and getting your very own Schnelling Point in return is
probably a reasonable amount of fun for your money.
I'll stop ranting now. :)

high-profile cracks on production ciphers employing key trial, the
press has latched onto keysize as a synonym for strength, and has made
numerous statements which have reinforced this questionable paradigm
in the minds of the public.
We have therefore been taking another look at our idea of a
combinatorial crack of DES, and decided that even with DES having been
cracked three times by key trial, it is definitely a project worth
doing.  This time, rather than working frantically in an unsuccessful
attempt to beat other teams on a public challenge, we wish to finish
up our original efforts, and repeat the three cracks previously done,
this time using our algorithms, and distribute working code
continuously as the project progresses, to sponsors who have donated
some money to defray our costs.  This will offer people the
opportunity to participate vicariously in a fun project which has the
potential to be a genuine paradigm shift in the way the world thinks
about codebreaking.
Sometimes, promising areas of research are not followed because of
knowlege of some well-known result which suggests that such
exploration will be unfruitful.  Years ago, for instance, suggestions
that programs could be checked by software for proper behavior, and
run without using protected memory regions, were usually met with
snide comments about the "computer halting problem" and various
adjunct results.  Today, there are many variants of "safe execution"
technology, from prove and carry schemes, to Java bytecode, with a
sound theoretical basis behind them.  None of these is a violation of
the "computer halting problem" results, of course.
Similarly, after a large burst of activity decades ago, which resulted
in the notion of NP-Completeness, and various results in computational
complexity theory, suggestions that an analytic solution exists for
some large combinatorial problem of practical interest conjure up
visions of exponential resource utilization, speaker cluenessless, and
the lack of progress on NP=P.
For this reason, we feel this project is definitely a Schnelling
Point.  If it works, even badly, people will begin to look at lots of
problems in ways they would not have considered before, and much new
code which improves upon what we have done will be created.  This will
be an irreversible change in the Order of Things.
In the several days since we put up our FAQ, we have gotten quite a
few comments, and some concerns.
The comments have mostly been along the lines that it is an
interesting, even intriguing project.  The concerns are generally that
we will experience an unexpected "combinatoric explosion" in the
higher round problems, and that no one in their right mind would send
money to a nym, because it might just vanish and be used by the nym to
live in perpetual ecstasy in some place warm and tropical, without the
possiblility of the nym being sued for fraud.
While we hope the close coupling between the sponsors and the project
members will eliminate this latter concern, with weekly progress
reports and working code being distributed to permit the sponsors to
reproduce our results as they occur.  If three people are willing to
sponsor and give us the go-ahead to begin, without wanting their money
back if other sponsors do not join, we can probably get through the
minimal S-Box representations and their proof-of-correctness as well
as some cleaned up code for the 2-round problem.  Hopefully we will
then have a reputation with these people which will encourage others
to join in the effort.
Clearly, we're after speculative capital, rather than widow and orphan
money, and hope a few of the wealthy older retired (and perhaps even
crusty) engineer types might find this a productive thing to support.
After all, if you've just blown $220,000 on a DES Cracker, making it
$220,500 and getting your very own Schnelling Point in return is
probably a reasonable amount of fun for your money.
I'll stop ranting now. :)

Anonymous The size of the problem scales linearly with the number of rounds, and
of course additional variables are introduced to make sure that terms
in the CNF representation reference three or less variables.
The number of such terms is clearly bounded by the cube of the number
of variables, and practical experiments with a wide variety of
problems illustrate that memory usage is generally limited to a small
integer multiple of the original problem size.  Intractability
generally appears as a lack of locality, in that canonicalization of
the problem requires the use of algebraic identities involving large
numbers of terms, such identities becoming statistically more rare
with increasing N.  We anticipate that the set of such identities
required to converge a DES problem will have a small N, and we will
simply augment that set should the algorithm cease to make progress
prior to finding a solution.  We know there will be no memory
explosion, and CPU should remain small enough for us to achieve our
stated goal of less than a day on a $5k workstation.
Back when we were working on the original DES challenge, with naive
S-Box optimization, the size of the input data sets were as follows.
            vars   implications   3-CNF terms
            ----   ------------   -----------
 2-round    2015           4046          1959
 4-round    4588           9192          4596
 8-round    9852          19720          9860
16-round   20389          40794         20397
Our original input sets were generated by a very indirect method,
involving an original implementation as switch networks, a conversion
to NANDs, and ultimately, 3-conjunctive normal form, with some simple
local optimization along the way.  We are a lot better at setting up
these problems now than we were the first time we tried, and
anticipate that we can knock down the variable count by at least a
factor of four by precomputing minimal S-Box representations.
This will result in a combinatorial problem in 4000 to 5000 variables
for full 16-round DES, and make this problem approximately equal in
size to where the 4-round problem is now.
We've run quite a few medium-sized problems through our combinatorial
algorithms, including reduced-round DES, factoring the 32 bit product
of two 16 bit primes written in terms of individual 2-intput logical
functions, and various problems involving minimizing representations
of boolean functions with respect to a specific cost criteria.
So far, no huge surprises.
Finding the global minimum cost representation of an S-Box in terms of
selected other functions is actually a good-sized combinatorial
problem in and of itself, and should serve to illustrate how our
algorithms work prior to embarking upon the higher round DES cracks.
We don't suggest that these algorithms magically solve every
conceivable problem, merely that they seem to do a satisfactory job on
a number of problems of practical interest.

The general boolean minimization problem is hard.  A specific boolean
minimization problem may or may not be difficult to solve.
Going back to our "safe execution" analogy; determining the runtime
properties of an arbitrary computer program by examination of the code
is impossible.  Determining whether Bob's page of assembler will write
all over the OS may be easy or hard, depending upon the code in
Knapsack with power of two integers is trivial, general knapsack is
NP-Complete, and random knapsack is not secure enough to be used as a
strong cryptosystem.
So given a specific problem, like DES, it is wrong to say that DES is
combinatorially intractable because general satisfiability is hard or
general boolean minimization is hard and DES has a polynomial
reduction into such a problem, or that DES cannot be broken
analytically because there have been no "spectacular breakthroughs" in
the general case of these other problems.
DES is a single instance, not a class of problems.  It is of some
constant degree of difficulty, and solving it, even under the image of
a transformation into an instance of some other well-known problem,
implies things only about the strength of DES, and not about the
general case of other classes of problems which might be used to
represent it.
Breaking N-Round DES tells us only about the resistance of N-Round DES
to whatever attack we are using, and does not imply intractable
problems do not exist, or disclose some new sneak attack against all
problems in NP.
After this project is done, hard problems will still be hard.
Hopefully what will have been demonstrated is that a small simple
block cipher designed in the mid-70's is algebraically crunchable in a
lot less time than an exhaustive search would take.  An interesting
result, but one which has no huge implications for the larger scheme
of things.

We are pleased to report that we have obtained our first sponsor.  Two
more, and if everyone is agreeable, we have decided to launch the
project, and get through as much of the early stuff in the FAQ as
Numerous comments on our sponsorship model have indicated that people
want the project results to be widely disseminated, and that exclusive
access is not an incentive for people to sponsor.
So - unless we get a lot of people saying that this is not the case,
we will probably just release stuff on the Web site as it becomes
available, along with emailing it to sponsors, and posting summaries
of interesting results to Cypherpunks.

Correct, multiplication by a non-zero residue modulo 65537 is a
permutation of the non-zero residues.  The central notion behind IDEA is
to use this operation, which can be expressed expeditiously in terms of
the unsigned 16x16->32 multiply, as a builtin wide S-Box.  This is how
IDEA manages to do strong encryption using only a few ordinary arithmetic
and logical instructions with no necessity for table lookup.
I didn't bother to read the rest of the rant.
