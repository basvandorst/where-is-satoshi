@_subject: Update from Konny Zsigo 
Hey...I want to give you an update on a number of things:
1. WirelessDeveloper 2001 is 3 weeks away; 11 DevCons from AT&T Wireless, Ericsson, Compaq, Openwave, TruePosition, RIM, Arch Wireless, PacketVideo, Pinpoint, Stonestreet One and Cream by Netpost.  Aug 20-24, Silicon Valley, CA. See   I'll be there the entire week along with all of my staff and would be happy to meet with you!
2. Do you need venture capital? We have 42 VCs signed up to receive your bus plans and most are coming to the show to book one-on-one meetings. It's free. See 3. Who should be Developer of the Year? We're taking nominations for the first annual Developer Choice Awards. 10 awards presented at the show. See 4. New Magazine! Our partner, Penton Media, is launching a new print magazine aptly called "WirelessDeveloper" - if you want a free trial subscription, reply to this email with Magazine in the subject and include your full contact info. I'll get you on the list.
and now, Konny's take on the industry as a whole...
As the President of WirelessDeveloper.com, I have the opportunity to talk to lots of developers, content providers, and others struggling to make the Wireless Internet a reality. It's been a shakeout year to be sure. Two guys with a Powerpoint presentation and a plan to capture "eyeballs" is a thing of the past. (but it was fun while it lasted).
Now boring is beautiful. If you have a sustainable business model and cash flow you're golden. Don't think for a second that the VCs have fled the space, they're just more selective. They're looking for deals, but I'm hearing that that they're not swinging as hard and they don't want to go solo [translate that to $2m investments x 4 VCs instead of $8m investment from 1 VC]. But I'm not the expert...I've got experts coming to the WirelessDeveloper 2001 show that will give us the real scoop on how to play More news. A significant number of content providers have tanked this past year. There's more room on the homedecks and there's a major industry-wide move to monetize browser-based apps. Lots of initiatives, lots of approaches, lots of people looking over their shoulders. But it will happen, and it will happen this next year. You'll be able to submit a fee-based application, have the carrier collect the revenues and then get a revenue-share on the back-end. I think NTT DoCoMo embarrassed us into it.
I hope you can make it to WirelessDeveloper 2001 this year. I'll have several guests on my TV Show (the Konny Zsigo show) and we'll explore all of these issues and more.
If you can't make it, at least update me on your contact information and tell me what you're up to!
Konny Zsigo, President
