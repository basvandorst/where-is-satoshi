So-called "anti-radiation pills" are made of potassium iodide (or sodium iodide; most any common iodide would work.).  They work by flooding the thyroid with iodine, so that extra radioactive iodine (from fallout) mostly passes through the body without effect.  They SHOULD be dirt-cheap; and they should have no expiration period.  (Although, I hear they are usually given such an expiration period; ignore it.)        Jim Bell

I doubt whether anyone who regularly posts on CP would admit to using their system.It would make _a_bit_ more sense if a person appended a fixed randomized string (of their OWN construction, one that nobody else knows...) to their usual password, perhaps AFTER ALSO customizing that password using the name of the website too.  However, it would certainly be questionable to advertise this randomized string on a keyboard.  Perhaps an array of characters, which only the user knew what portion to employ.  (Right/left, Up/down, diagonal, etc.)Depends on the threat model, of course.                 Jim Bell

The thing I REALLY want to see exposed is the fake, phony, forged docket for Ninth Circuit Court appeal case 99-30210.  It's the appeal case that was secretly initiated by corrupt attorney Judith Mandel Levins on about June 20, 1999, one day before she resigned.  Naturally, she never told me about the existence of that.     :  And, for the next 10 months or so, I received no mail from that court about that case:  Ordinarily, I (ostensibly representing myself, but completely unaware of the existence of that case) should have gotten mail, but I didn't get any mail while at FDC Seatac (until about September 3, 1999) nor at FCI Phoenix (from about Sept 10, 1999 through April 13, 2000.)
The phony docket was forged, but it was again re-forged, probably about May 2000, when they discovered that I was demanding a REAL appeal, still not having learned of the pre-April 2000 existence of that case.  (Unfortunately, I was unable to write very much about my May 20 discovery of the phony appeal case, in my July 2003 refiling of my Portland Federal Court lawsuit.        This is because I was using someone in Portland doing the editing, and I learned about that phony case too late to add a lot.  I did put in a few mentions, however.)
The docket is available to anyone, for free, using the PACER ( system, if you use less than 150 pages per calendar quarter.  Also, there are at least two FORGED filings, ostensibly from me, dated (from memory) approximately November 20, 1999 and March 5, 2000.  The first was a handwritten filing, ostensibly in my handwriting, but anyone who knows my handwriting knows it to be terrible.  THAT handwriting was very neat; Probably a woman's handwriting.  The March 5 filing was apparently done using a modern word-processor, although the law library at FCI Phoenix did not have such; only typewriters.

Italy cracks Mafia sheep code to arrest Godfather's henchmen
By Ella Ide 1 hour ago
Rome (AFP) - Italian police on Monday arrested 11 suspects linked to the fugitive head of the Sicilian Mafia, including a former boss who ran a secret message system for the mobster using a sheep-based code.
Matteo Messina Denaro, 53, who has been on the run since 1993, used a farm in Mazara del Vallo to communicate with his henchmen via the aged-old method of "pizzini", bits of paper containing messages often written in cipher, police said.
Among those arrested was former boss Vito Gondola, 77, whose job it was to call the clan members to alert them to each new message, which was placed under a rock in a field at the farm and often destroyed on the spot after reading.
"I've put the ricotta cheese aside for you, will you come by later?" he would say on the telephone -- a phrase investigators said had nothing to do with dairy products.
"The sheep need shearing... the shears need sharpening" and "the hay is ready", were among other code phrases used to alert the gang to a new message, written on tightly folded bits of paper wrapped in Sellotape and then hidden in the dirt.
The police investigation, which followed the passing of messages between 2011 and 2014, used hidden cameras and microphones around the farm near Trapani in western Sicily to follow the movements of the clan -- and discover Denaro's fading glory.
View gallery
Gondola is caught in one conversation telling another mobster that Denaro -- once a trigger man who reportedly boasted he could "fill a cemetery" with his victims -- was losing control over the latest generation of criminals, who "disappear without saying anything".
- 'State win, Mafia loses' -
Three of those arrested were over 70 years old.
The only known photos of Denaro date back to the early 1990s. He is believed to be the successor of the godfathers Toto Riina and Bernardo Provenzano, who are both serving life sentences, but less is known about him.
At the height of his power he had a reputation as a flashy, ruthless womaniser who ruled over at least 900 men with an iron fist.
View gallery
The 11 suspects arrested "were the men who were closest to Denaro right now," said police official Renato Cortese, adding that it was "too early to say" whether the sting would help investigators close in on the fugitive.
Prime Minister Matteo Renzi thanked the investigators in a message on his Facebook page, saying onwards all, to finally capture the super-fugitive boss," insisting "Italy is united against organised crime" despite a recent slew of corruption scandals in the country.
"The state wins, the Mafia loses," Interior Minister Angelino Alfano said on Twitter.
Gondola, who despite his age rose every morning at 4 am to tend to his flock, is believed to have once been a right-hand man to Riina. In the 1970s he belonged to a gang used by the Mafia to carry out kidnappings, according to Italian media reports.
The Sicilian Mafia, known as "Cosa Nostra" or "Our Thing", was the country's most powerful organised crime syndicate in the 1980s and 1990s, but has seen its power diminish following years of investigations and mass arrests.
It also faces fierce underworld competition from the increasingly powerful Naples-based Camorra and Calabria's 'Ndrangheta.

@_subject: Constitutionality of tracking cell phones. 
Constitution Check: Does cellphone privacy follow its owner’s wanderings? Lyle Denniston, the National Constitution Center’s constitutional literacy adviser, examines a case that has just arrived at the Supreme Court about police access to cellphone location data stored on cellphone towers. View photo.THE STATEMENT AT ISSUE: “As technology advances, location information from cellphones (and, of course, smartphones) will undoubtedly become more precise and easier to obtain, and if there is no expectation of privacy here, I have some concerns about the government being able to conduct 24/7 electronic tracking (live or historical) in the years to come without an appropriate judicial order.  And I do not think I am alone in this respect.” – Excerpt from an opinion by a federal judge, Adalberto Jordan of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, limiting his support for a ruling by that court rejecting a Florida man’s Fourth Amendment challenge to federal investigators’ monitoring of the places where he used a cellphone over a continuous span of more than two months.  That individual has now filed an appeal at the Supreme Court. WE CHECKED THE CONSTITUTION, AND… For nearly a half-century, it has been true that a private individual carries around as a kind of personal constitutional shield a right of privacy.  As the Supreme Court put it in a famous decision in 1967, “wherever a man may be, he is entitled to know that he will remain free from unreasonable searches and seizures.”  All that is necessary to have that shield available as that individual moves about, the court said then, is that he or she is doing something that they personally regard as private, and that society in general would agree that it should be private. In technical constitutional terms, that decision in Katz v. United States – extending protection to what an individual said while using a public telephone booth – was the origin of the idea that the Fourth Amendment protects “a reasonable expectation of privacy.” That amendment, the court said, “protects people, not places.” In the case of the telephone booth, the caller may have been entirely visible through the glass doors, but was still expecting that the actual messages spoken into the telephone were meant to be heard only by the person on the other end. It is too much to say, however, that the individual never loses that privacy once the activity moves outside the enclave of the home into the larger world.  The catch is that part of the test that says society must share the perception that the activity does deserve to remain private.  Even in that 1967 ruling, the court was careful to say that “what a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection.” That, of course, makes the protection of that amendment depend in part on the specific action the individual takes to show that the activity was meant to be private – such as closing the door on the telephone booth. Complicating the constitutional question, however, is the situation when an individual tries to keep something private, but strangers (“third parties,” in the language of law) learn of that activity.  That was the scenario that the Supreme Court encountered in 1979, when it allowed law enforcement officers to obtain from a telephone company the numbers that a user had dialed. That, the Justices ruled in the case of Smith v. Maryland, was not even a search under the Fourth Amendment, because the individual gave up the privacy about those numbers merely by dialing; that allowed a record to be made in the files of the company.  Besides, the court added, the officers did not learn much from that data; they could not even be sure that any call actually had connected. Lately, though, that part of Fourth Amendment law is being reexamined in the courts, as changes in technology make it far more likely that a person’s activities in public can be tracked much more closely, and thus more intrusively. Three years ago, the Supreme Court for the first time examined what it means to privacy that police can use a tracking device, linked to globe-circling satellites, to trace the movement of a suspect’s car, and thus some of the activities of the car’s driver.  The decision in Jones v. United States was limited, based on a theory that installation of the device was a “trespass,” but it has come to stand for two larger principles: first, that officers should get a warrant before they do such monitoring, and, second, that technology can definitely change the Fourth Amendment equation about what is private. Last year, the court went further in this examination, concluding that police should get a warrant before they check out the stored contents of a cellphone that police take away from an individual they have arrested.  What is logged on a cellphone, the Justices said, can include a vast amount of intensely personal data, and police access to that should only be allowed if a judge has found a good reason to issue a search warrant to get at it. The next step in this constitutional evolution has just arrived in an appeal to the Supreme Court, in the case of Davis v. United States.  It is a test of the privacy – or lack of it – of the information that police may gather by checking stored data on cellphone towers located around a community.  The majority of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit decided that this did not even implicate the Fourth Amendment, because an individual has no “reasonable expectation of privacy” in the location data; that is a record kept by the tower operator, the telephone company, and the individual whose calls were logged gave it up merely by using his cellphone. The data, covering 67 continuous days of use on that cellphone, was technically so refined and detailed that it actually placed the user – Quartavius Davis – at the scene of a series of robberies of local businesses in the Miami, Fla., area.    Davis’s lawyers have calculated that the towers yielded more than 11,000 bits of data about where he was when he made or got a call.  The data was used to convict him of a series of federal crimes, and his lawyers failed to get that excluded from his case on a theory that it invaded his right of privacy in his movements, so should have been barred unless police had a search warrant. Taking that case on to the Supreme Court, his attorneys argued that the Justices needed to step in now “to ensure that the Fourth Amendment does not become a dead letter as police accelerate their warrantless access to rich troves of sensitive personal location data.” The court is expected to act on the case early in the next term.

Note:  There are two clues which show that this docket was forged and thus fraudulent.  The docket item number, which is immediately to the right of the date, should be sequential numbers starting from 1 and going up.  SOMETIMES these numbers aren't precisely sequential (they may appear as 1,2,3,5,4... etc) but they should ALWAYS be present.
When I received this docket about June 20, 2003, 29 of the 79 docket entries were MISSING.  That should NEVER happen!  What actually, apparently happened is that the 9th Circuit personnel FORGED (falsified) the docket about May 2000, after they discovered that I was demanding to have an appeal of the lower-court case.  Before that time (say, March 2000) those court personnel believed (correctly, as it happened) that I was not aware of the existence of this court case, 99-30210.  They expected this appeal case to 'die'.  My demand for an appeal, though I was not aware of the existence of 99-30210, really messed things up for them!  They couldn't refuse to give me an appeal, because I was already shown as having an appeal in progress!  They appointed another corrupt attorney, Jonathan Solovy, to generate an appeal, but it was necessary to FIRST 'manipulate' the docket for 99-30210, to make it appear that this appeal had merely remained dormant in the period July 1999-April 2000. This I believe they did in May 2000.  The backups for appeal case 99-30210 (made during the period June 1999 through August 2000) should show this forgery. Solovy's job (which he did) was to conceal the pre-April 2000 existence of appeal case 99-30210 from me.

References: This is the SECOND appeal from case 00-5731, done weeks after my first, Interlocutory Appeal.  This is the appeal that those conspiring against me WANTED to be "the appeal".   But its very existence was improper, because it ignores the prior, CORRECT appeal, which I initiated in March 2001.

References: Notice the reference to "Jurisdictional Defects", below.  They were trying to pretend that the filing of an Interlocutory appeal did not divest jurisdiction from the District Court case below.  For those looking up, see the "Dunbar Rule".  My filing was proper, and was jurisdictional, so Judge Tanner shouldn't have been able to proceed with what in reality was a phony trial.

References: There were actually TWO appeal filings by me; I perhaps got them out of order in my last note here, a moment ago.  This might have been the second one of them filing around the time of the "sentencing".  Because the District Court had ignored its loss of jurisdiction, I felt it appropriate to yet again appeal the "sentencing".

a declaration or notarized statement attesting to the date on which
the notice of appeal was deposited in the institution's internal mail
systen and whether first-class postage was prepaid, or otherwise show

08/11/2004      11     Filed order (Johnnie B. RAWLINSON, CONSUELO M.
CALLAHAN) A review of the record indicates that the notice of appeal
in this case ws timely filed. The 7/9/04 order to show cuse is
therefore discharged. To the extend appellant has moved to have the
panel recuse itself from consideration of this appeal, that request is
denied. To the extend appellant has moved for appt. of counsel in this
appeal. that request is denied because he is not entitled to appt of
counsel and this appeal does not present exceptional circumstances
warranting the appt of counsel. (see casefile for citations). No
motions for recon , clarification, modification of the denial of appt.
of counsel shall be filed or entertained. The court's records reflect
that this case may be appropriate for summary disposition because
appellant is no longer entitled to appt of counsel. Within 21 days,
appellant shall show cause why the DC's order allowing counsel to
withdraw shall not be summarily affirmed. If appellant does not comply
with this order, this appeal will be automatically dismissed for
failure to prosecute. Briefing remains suspended pending further order

05/18/2005      3     Filed order ( Harry PREGERSON, William C. CANBY, ):
The ct, sua sponte, consolidates appl number 05-35289 and 05-35291. A
review of the record demonstrates that, although the 3/10/05 and
3/15/05 notices of appl were not filed within 60 days from entry of
the 1/7/05 judgment, aplts filed timely mtns for ext of time to appl
pursuant to FRAP 4(a)(5), which were contained in the notices of app.
The dc has not ruled on those motions. Accordingly, these appls are
remanded to the dc for the limited purpose of allowing that ct to rule
on aplts' mtns. The dc is requested to serve a copy of its decision on
this ct at its earliest convenience. Br in these appls is stayed
pending further order of this ct. [05-35289, 05-35291] (GR) [Entered:

07/21/2005      11     Order filed: A review of the record demonstrates that
this court lacks jurisdiction over appeal no. 05-35291 because the
3/15/05 notice of appeal was not filed within 60 days from entry of
the 1/7/05 judgment...CITE. Consequently, appeal no. 05-35291 is
DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction. Although the district court also
denied aplt James Bell's motion for ext of time to appeal no.
05-35289, further review of the record reflects that aplt Bell's
appeal was timely filed pursuant to FRAP 4(c) because aplt Bell is
incarcerated and his 3/10/05 noa was recvd by the dc one day after the
deadline prescribed by FRAP 4(a)(1). Consequently, appeal no. 05-35289
shall proceed. A review of this court's docket in appeal no. 05-35289
reflects that the filing and docketing fees for this appeal remain
due. Within 21 days after the filing date of this order, aplt Bell
shall pay to the dc the $255.00 filing and docketing fees for this
appeal and file in this court proof of such payment or file in this
court a motion to proceed ifp. Failure to pay the fees or file a
motion to proceed ifp shall result in the automatic dismissal of the
appeal by the clerk for failure to prosecute. See 9th Cir.R. 42-1. (

@_subject: Death lists. 
Las Vegas (AFP) - Hackers at an infamous annual Def Con gathering in Las Vegas got schooled in how to be online killers.A rush to go digital with the process of registering deaths has made it simple for maliciously minded folks to have someone who is alive declared dead by the authorities."This is a global problem," Australian computer security specialist Chris Rock said as he launched a presentation titled "I Will Kill You."The process of having someone officially stamped dead by getting a death certificate issued typically involves a doctor filling out one form and a funeral home filling out another, according to Rock's research.Once forms are submitted online, certificates declaring the listed person legally dead are generated.A fatal flaw in the system is that people can easily pose as real doctors and funeral directors, Rock demonstrated to a rapt audience.Doctors practising general medicine often don't bother setting up accounts at online portals for filling out information for death certificates.An aspiring online assassin can step into that void, and borrow the identity of a doctor.Setting up accounts requires a doctor's name, address, and medical license number. A basic Internet search will turn up that information, which is publicly available for the well-intended purpose of letting people check that physicians are legitimate before seeking care.Drop down boxes containing illness categories and online guides are available for filling in "doctor speak" on forms and avoiding medical causes or circumstances that might trigger needs for autopsies or investigations, Rock's demonstration showed.- No one off limits -Borrowing a funeral director's identity to establish an online account for death certificate purposes was shown to be simple as well. Required information about legitimate funeral directors is posted on the Internet, and one could even claim to work at a funeral home.In Rock's case, he made a website for a bogus funeral home and used that to back his application for an account as director. He got an automated call days later saying he was approved.With both online accounts in place, deaths can be registered in the real world."You could kill anyone you want," Rock told AFP after the presentation. "No one is off limits."A humor-infused list of scenarios included killing oneself off to get life insurance cash or going after others for vengeance.Someone targeted might not even know they were declared dead until doing something official like trying to renew a passport or driving license.Rock began digging into the death industry a year ago after an Australian hospital accidentally declared 200 patients dead.- Virtual babies -Getting birth certificates for virtual babies was demonstrated to be even easier than killing off people in the digital world, because registering births online only involves doctors and parents."Once you log on as a doctor, not only can you kill someone, you can actually birth someone," Rock said.Given the time it takes for even a make-believe baby to grow into adulthood, he saw that as more tempting to crime gangs who could invest in the future by creating legions of virtual people for shady doings involving loans, stock trading, imports or other activities."You could even make fake identities for your children, so when they grow up they have burner identities," Rock said.He dove into virtual birth and death in his book titled "The Baby Harvest: How virtual babies become the future of terrorist financing and money laundering."

The tv show 60 Minutes spilled the beans about Enigma in 1975.   most people didn't realize was that the controversy was due to the fact that rotor-driven cipher machines had been continued to be sold in the post-WWII era, without their weakness being recognized.  This allowed the CIA/GCHQ to continue to decrypt enciphered messages for decades afterwards.             Jim Bell

@_subject: Reinventing the Wheel 
Partial quote:"Some of the earliest adopters of the digital currency Bitcoin were criminals, who have found it invaluable in online marketplaces for contraband and as payment extorted through lucrative “ransomware” that holds personal data hostage. A new Bitcoin-inspired technology that some investors believe will be much more useful and powerful may be set to unlock a new wave of criminal innovation.That technology is known as smart contracts—small computer programs that can do things like execute financial trades or notarize documents in a legal agreement. Intended to take the place of third-party human administrators such as lawyers, which are required in many deals and agreements, they can verify information and hold or use funds using similar cryptography to that which underpins Bitcoin.Some companies think smart contracts could make financial markets more efficient, or simplify complex transactions such as property deals (see “The Startup Meant to Reinvent What Bitcoin Can Do”). Ari Juels, a cryptographer and professor at the Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute at Cornell Tech, believes they will also be useful for illegal activity–and, with two collaborators, he has demonstrated how.“In some ways this is the perfect vehicle for criminal acts, because it’s meant to create trust in situations where otherwise it’s difficult to achieve,” says Juels.In a paper to be released today, Juels, fellow Cornell professor Elaine Shi, and University of Maryland researcher Ahmed Kosba present several examples of what they call “criminal contracts.” They wrote them to work on the recently launched smart-contract platform Ethereum.One example is a contract offering a cryptocurrency reward for hacking a particular website. Ethereum’s programming language makes it possible for the contract to control the promised funds. It will release them only to someone who provides proof of having carried out the job, in the form of a cryptographically verifiable string added to the defaced site.Contracts with a similar design could be used to commission many kinds of crime, say the researchers. Most provocatively, they outline a version designed to arrange the assassination of a public figure. A person wishing to claim the bounty would have to send information such as the time and place of the killing in advance. The contract would pay out after verifying that those details had appeared in several trusted news sources, such as news wires. A similar approach could be used for lesser physical crimes, such as high-profile vandalism.“It was a bit of a surprise to me that these types of crimes in the physical world could be enabled by a digital system,” says Juels. He and his coauthors say they are trying to publicize the potential for such activity to get technologists and policy makers thinking about how to make sure the positives of smart contracts outweigh the negatives.“We are optimistic about their beneficial applications, but crime is something that is going to have to be dealt with in an effective way if those benefits are to bear fruit,” says Shi.Nicolas Christin, an assistant professor at Carnegie Mellon University who has studied criminal uses of Bitcoin, agrees there is potential for smart contracts to be embraced by the underground. “It will not be surprising,” he says. “Fringe businesses tend to be the first adopters of new technologies, because they don’t have anything to lose.”[end of partial quote]

@_subject: Augur:  Blockchain-based Internet prediction market. 
Augur May Become the Greatest Gambling Platform in History. Is There Anything the Government Can Do to Stop It?
A blockchain-based prediction market that won’t be controlled or managed by anyone.
Jim Epstein   Aug. 11, 2015 12:36 pm
An online gambling platform could do to the neighborhood bookie what electric refrigerators did to the ice delivery man.
Coming this fall, Augur will allow participants to wager money on any future event of their choosing. Software will set the odds, collect the bets, and disperse the winnings. The price alone should give Nevada sportsbook operators pause; an estimated one percent of every pot will go to keep the system running. The average vig today is about 10 times that.
Augur isn't a full-fledged casino. You can't play roulette or poker, and running lotto on the platform would be tricky. But it'll be great for sports betting.
Here’s what’s truly novel about Augur: It won’t be controlled by any person or entity, nor will it operate off of any one computer network. All the money in the system will be in Bitcoin, or other types of peer-to-peer cryptocurrency, so no credit card companies or banks need to be involved. If the system runs afoul of regulators—and if it’s successful, it most certainly will—they'll find that there's no company to sue, no computer hardware to pull out of the wall, and no CEO to lockup in a cage.This is new legal territory. If Augur catches on as a tool for betting on everything from basketball games to stock prices, is there anything the government can do to stop it?
Augur is a decentralized peer-to-peer marketplace, a new kind of entity made possible by recent breakthroughs in computer science. The purpose of these platforms is to facilitate the exchange of goods and services among perfect strangers on a platform that nobody administers or controls. Augur’s software will run on what’s known as a “blockchain"—a concept introduced in 2008 with the invention of Bitcoin—that's essentially a shared database for executing trades that's powered and maintained by its users.
Bitcoin’s blockchain was designed as a banking ledger of sorts—kind of like a distributed Microsoft Excel file—but Augur will utilize a groundbreaking new project called Ethereum that expands on this concept. Ethereum allows Augur's entire system to live on the blockchain. That means the software and processing power that makes Augur function will be distributed among hundreds or thousands of computers. Destroying Augur would involve unplugging the computers of everyone in the world participating in the Ethereum blockchain.
If Augur is destined to become the cypherpunks answer to gambling prohibition—the betting man’s version of the online drug market Silk Road if you will—you'd never know it from talking with its developers. They work for a San Francisco-based nonprofit, attend conferences, have legal representation, and talk openly about what they’re up to with reporters. Augur even commissionedone of those cheesy motion graphics promotional videos favored by new tech startups.
About half of the roughly $600,000 raised by Augur's development team comes from Joe Costello, the successful tech entrepreneur who was once Steve Jobs' top pick to become the CEO of Apple.
Joey Krug, a twenty-year-old Pomona college dropout and Augur's lead developer, never uses the world “gambling" to describe his venture. He and his team of five employees call Augur a “prediction market,” a term that emphasizes the information generated when a bunch of people have a financial incentive to feed their expertise into a sophisticated algorithm.
With Augur, as bettors move money in and out of the pot, the odds adjust. This yields publicly available statistics that should carry weight because they're derived from the opinions of a crowd of people with a stake in the results. InTrade, for example, the best-known prediction market until federal regulators forced it to stop serving U.S. customers in 2012, beat the pollsters and pundits by foreseeing the outcome of the 2008 presidential elections in 48 out of 50 states.
Augur’s developers hope that their platform will make it possible to do a Google search to look up the likelihood of some future event. This could usher in a better world, with more informed policy decisions and less malinvestment.
But Augur also serves the less high-minded—though no less noble—purpose of providing cost savings and convenience to gamblers. Restrictions on gambling serve to protect government revenue at the betting man's expense. State-sanctioned casino operators pay high taxes, and state-run lotteries fleece their customers. But there's no logical or moral case for government restrictions on gambling, since no third party is harmed when consenting adults wager money on the future. Augur actually has the potential to make the world safer by taking away market share in the gambling industry from criminals.
And yet sports betting is illegal in most states, and prediction markets are tightly regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CTFC). The agency sued Ireland-based InTrade in 2012 to prevent it from accepting bets from U.S. customers. (The company folded shortly after.) In 2013, the CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) jointly sued the prediction market Banc de Binary for allowing U.S. customers to make bets on commodity prices.
The CFTC has approved other prediction markets, such as the New Zealand-based PredictIt, but only after it agreed to abide by the agency's restrictions.
Krug says the Augur team is planning to meet with CFTC staff go over how their system works before it’s launched, but says he's not overly concerned. “Our friends in Washington, D.C. say the CFTC will probably just dismiss Augur and say it’s not a big deal,” Krug told me in a phone interview.
That doesn’t sound like much of a legal strategy, but how do you have a legal strategy when you're building something unlike anything that's ever existed? Federal anti-gambling laws, such as the 2006 Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act, target the companies that facilitate online betting— website operators, credit card companies, banks—not individual gamblers.
Augur’s biggest legal vulnerability is the community of human “reporters” who are needed to settle bets on the platform, says Cardozo Law School's Aaron Wright, who is writing a book about the legal implications of blockchain technology. Let’s say a group of people wager money on Augur over the outcome of a boxing match. Once the bout is over, human participants (who receive a portion of the trading fees as compensation) must report the outcome to the system before Augur’s software will disperse the money to the winners. "There’s at least an argument that the people doing that reporting are aiding or abetting unlicensed options and could be prosecuted," says Wright.
But Augur doesn't collect personal information on any of its users, so identifying these people could be difficult. And Augur is a borderless technology, so U.S. gamblers could simply rely on foreigners to report on the outcomes of their bets.
One attorney I spoke with suggested that the team that’s building Augur could be brought up on charges for aiding and abetting a criminal conspiracy. Nate Cardozo, a staff attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, thinks that's far-fetched but says he can't rule it out. Cardozo emphasizes that writing open source software doesn’t necessarily protect the team from prosecution.
“We’ve taken the steps that we need to take in order to bracket the individual's risk and the organization’s risk,” says Augur’s attorney, Marco Santori, who declined to comment further on exactly what those steps might entail.
Even if Krug and his colleagues were to face criminal prosecution, the technology would live on. After Augur is born into the world, the development team could release a software update that would cripple the system. But in that case, Augur's users could band together to block any changes to the underlying code, or another developer could copy the open source code and simply re-launch the platform. 
The big question with Augur—and with blockchain platforms more generally—is whether they can outrun our regulatory state long enough to grow so large and popular that they're truly unstoppable. My money’s on Augur in that race.

Hello everybody,
it would be my pleasure to invite you to cypherpunk conference Parallel Polis Congress 2015 that will take place during 2-4.10.2015 in Prague / Central
Don't hesitate and join this great and unique event (more information below). Last year we had more than 1000 visitors from different countries, see the
Speakers already confirmed for this year - Lyn Ulbricht, Paul Rosenberg,
!Mediengruppe Bitnik, Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof, Julia Tourianski,
Smuggler, Frank Braun, Slush, Stef, ..and much more.
* Parallel Polis in theory
Parallel Polis is a theoretical concept developed by Czech dissident Vaclav Benda (1942–1999) during the height of communist domination in Czechoslovakia in the 1970s. It was translated into English in 1978.
Benda argues that in a repressed state, it is impossible to overturn corrupt social, economic and political institutions. Such efforts are futile.
Instead, he suggests the creation of new "parallel institutions" that are more responsible to human needs.
* Parallel Polis in practice
We were impressed by the concept of Vaclav Benda’s Parallel Polis and Timothy C May’s Crypto Anarchistic Manifesto and Cyphernomicon. Embracing the current crypto-technologies we have realized a practical feasibility of these utopian theories and started a unique freedom think tank focused on the promotion of digital freedom, cryptocurrencies, anonymization networks and free markets.
For this purpose we decided to rent a big 3-floor house (with almost 1000m2) in the center of Prague (Holešovice) - one floor dedicated to Bitcoin coffee-house, hub and hackerspace called Institute of Cryptoanarchy. :)
* Founders of Parallel Polis
Parallel polis is 100% state-free project, based on voluntary contributions only of our members and donors.
Founding members are people from Czech contemporary-art group Ztohoven ( and group of cryptoanarchists from Czech and Slovak hackerspaces, see their recent projects Moral Reform (hack of Czech Parliament)  and Citizen K (  )
* Parallel Polis Congress and why we need you!
Parallel Polis Congress is a 1-birthday party of a new era of our freedom. For such a unique event, we decided to invite all speakers whom we have loved and respected for a long time.
* When & Where
Parallel Polis Congress takes place in Parallel Polis building (Dělnická 43, Prague) during 2-4.10.2015.
If you prefer to take public transport, take the tram number 1, 12, 14, 25, 53 or 54 to the tram station Dělnická.

@_subject: yahoo encryption article 
Encryption has been all over the headlines after recent terrorist attacks, and the discussion can quickly get cryptic. Is “crypto” a fatal weakness of the Internet? An endangered species that must be saved? You can hear heartfelt testimony for either view from both Democratic and Republican politicians.
But ultimately, encryption is just math that, like any other tool, can be used for good or ill. Let’s start with some basics about it that often get neglected in all the commentary.
Q. It was my understanding there would be no math in this story…?
A. Sorry, it’s unavoidable: Encryption works by encoding information in such a way that its recipient can decode it (without further help from its sender), but no one else can. To do that scrambling, you need to run the original data through one equation or another.
For example, to encrypt something against the prying eyes of somebody who’s really, really drunk, you could just replace each letter with one 13 places forward (so “A” becomes “N” and so on). If your eavesdropper is more capable, you’ll need something more complicated — but it’s still all equations.
Q. Okay. What makes for strong cryptography?
A. Using more complex math in an encryption algorithm only goes so far if the sender and recipient use the same key — that is, if they both plug the same secret set of digits into the encryption formula — to encrypt and decrypt. In that case, if either party loses the key, game over.

Again, not surprising.  Take a picture of a (non-sun) star, with a small-lens camera (under 50 inch objective) and that star should appear as a point source of light, if the camera is well-focussed.  Even then, the amount of light hitting that analog "pixel" is probably vastly lower than a camera aiming at a nearby surface illuminated by earth's Sun, as would be seen on the Moon by an astronaut taking a picture.
"A release by Kodak showcased that most film has around 13 stops of dynamic range."
That's a factor of about 8000.             Jim Bell

Exactly correct.
Suppose you take an old-style film camera, one without any sort of automatic
exposure adjustments, to the bright, sunlit beach, and adjusted it to take
good pictures with correct exposures.  Then you wait 12 hours, and it is nighttime.  You do not adjust your camera's settings. If you take a picture
of the sky (except possibly for the Moon) you will see...nothing.  But if you open up the aperture (a variable-diameter shutter designed to allow more, or less, area for light to come in and expose the film), and perhaps if you increased the shutter-speed from, say, 1/1000 second to maybe 10 seconds (and
putting the camera on a tripod to ensure it doesn't move), THEN you will be able
to photograph stars.
That should be easy.  And it would be far easier if built onto that object are
 some microwave-sized  "corner cubes reflectors"  , which have the peculiar property of sending radar (or light, etc) directly back in the direction
 from which it came.  Optical corner-cubes are easy to find:  They are on the backs of cars, and are
used as visual retroreflectors on roads.  They are much better than Scotchlite   , which is made from
tiny glass spheres.

References: Lack of pressure suit:  No problem.  Early ideas for experimental space included
one that was basically Ace bandages wound around the body.  The skin was exposed
 to the vacuum; the purpose of the bandage was to keep the water from 'boiling'
with the vapor expanding under the skin.  The vapor pressure of water at body temperature, 37 degrees
 C,  is about 50 torr.  One atmosphere pressure at sea level is about 760 torr.  Atmospheric pressure at 50,000 feet is 83 torr.  (1 torr is a mercury column 1
 millimeter high.)
One important need will be thermal insulation, including gloves and a mask.  Lack of oxygen could easily be a problem.  But neglecting air friction, a person would fall about 16,000 feet in 31 seconds.  (1/2 a t-squared) I've read it said that it is just
barely within the realm of possibility for a person to ascend Everest (28,000 feet)
without oxygen.  Presumably, merely falling for 45 seconds  would be far easier. WITH pure oxygen should make things much more doable.
As for hitting the water without a parachute:  If a person's orientation could be guaranteed, the danger
would be little worse than an ordinary high-diver.  Give him a drogue parachute, could be quite small,
and he will enter the water at a known position.

Clearly you should make a request for the source code for the the Promis software as used by the FBI. It's public domain.
I reject and demand appeal of your rejection of this request.
First and foremost, please recognize that the GSF Explorer, formerly
USNS Hughes Glomar Explorer (T-AG-193), for which this Glomar response
is so named, was a purely military operation, using custom-built
military equipment, on an exceptionally sensitive military mission to
recover military equipment. Observe that the "Vulnerabilities Equities
Process" is a public outreach activity communicating with third party
partners, acting in the public interest regarding software used by
public citizens and business alike - a scenario at opposite ends and
means from which this denial blindly overreaches.
Second, observe that existing precedent supports the release of
materials responsive to this request. In American Civil Liberties
Union v. Department of Defense Case No: 04-CV-4151 (ACLU v. DoD) the
courts have affirmed the public interest as compelling argument for
favoring the public interest against clearly military efforts. The
Glomar denial should be well targeted; this targeted falls well
outside of the the "Vulnerabilities Equities Process", which is a
public outreach activity communicating with third party partners,
acting in the public interest, regarding software used by public
citizens and business alike.
Third, consider that it is a well established technique in the
information security industry to identify the origin and nature of a
defect discovery and disclosure timeline. This information is used for
myriad of secondary research, analysis, and automation efforts
spanning numerous industries. The utility of of disclosure timeline
information and context has decades of rich support and strong
evidence of public interest benefit, particularly regarding long
reported and fixed defects, such as this one, which has patches
available for over a year.
Fourth, observe that every hour of expert opinion coupled with legal
review amounts to a non-trivial expenditure of hours which are a sunk,
throw away cost of FOIA communication. While as a taxpayer I
appreciate the service of FOIA professionals such as those involved in
this request, who provide tireless effort the all hundreds of millions
of US citizens, my personal cost should be recognized. For this reason
a deference in favor of public interest and disclosure is well
supported for this request regarding the "Vulnerabilities Equities
Process", which is a public outreach activity communicating with third
party partners, acting in the public interest, regarding software used
by public citizens and business alike.
Thank you for your time, and best regards,

 > (II) terrorism;
Aha!  It's yet another "Anti-Jim-Bell" law!  I have a long history of causing legislatures to change the laws to obstruct what I'm doing.  In 1990, I made an infrared-emitting device, mounted on my car, to cause it to look like an emergency vehicle, and turn red traffic lights to green.   (The device being tricked was made by 3M, trademarked Opticom.  (I called my device the "Optigreen).  One example is:       )   My device emitted at 880 nm wavelength, about 14.035 pulses per minute.  In 1993, I made a large number of them for friends, sale, etc.Hearing about it, the Oregon Legislature passed the following law in 1994:   
815.440¹ 
Unauthorized possession, use or distribution of traffic control signal operating device      - • exemption
   - • penalty
(1)A person commits the offense of unauthorized possession, use or distribution of a traffic control signal operating device if the person owns, uses, sells or otherwise distributes a device that is designed to control a traffic control light as a person using the device approaches the light.   "
A few years late, the US Congress enacted a law which criminalized the same thing, federally:  18 U.S.C. 39:  
"(a) Offenses.—(1) Sale.— Whoever, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, knowingly sells a traffic signal preemption transmitter to a nonqualifying user shall be fined under this title, or imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both.(2) Use.— Whoever, in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce, being a nonqualifying user makes unauthorized use of a traffic signal preemption transmitter shall be fined under this title, or imprisoned not more than 6 months, or both.(b) Definitions.— In this section, the following definitions apply:(1) Traffic signal preemption transmitter.— The term “traffic signal preemption transmitter” means any mechanism that can change or alter a traffic signal’s phase time or sequence."

References:   From: Tom Ritter Months ago, FLIR announced an IR-imaging add-on for IPhones, which is tiny.  However, just a month or two ago I saw a media reference to a (very tiny) T-shaped device, intended to plug into the micro-USB jack of a cell phone, that did IR imaging.  As I recall, very economical, but even then the majority of the population won't buy, simply because they have no need for such a thing most of the time.
This 'extension' principle doesn't always work.  In 2012, the Supreme Court ruled (US v. Jones)   that police could not place a GPS tracking device on a car without a warrant.  One argument that has been rejected in lower-court cases was the idea that in principle, a car's movements could be tracked with an army of police, one per street corner, so that a GPS tracking bug simply automated that process.  One problem that argument is that society not only doesn't have the resources to accomplish such a blanket coverage of an area, and that even if practical, society may not necessarily want such an intrusive system to exist.
This issue was (secretly) quite relevant to me.  Federal authorities apparently installed a tracking device on a car I used, probably in about April 2000, without a warrant.  Presumably, if challenged they would have been claiming to follow a 9th Circuit Court of Appeals decision from 1999,  U.S. v. McIver, which had allowed the placement of a GPS tracking device on a truck seen at the location of a marijuana growing operation.  The problem with this justification, however, is that at least in McIver, there was an actual crime involved, and the truck was plausibly involved in that crime.  In my case, after my release from prison in April 2000, nobody alleged that I was engaging in any crime.  The McIver case didn't rule that police could simply choose to place a GPS tracking device on ANY car, for no reason, and even without 'probable cause' or 'reasonable suspicion'.
What was particularly devious (and I call illegal) was that later, probably in October 2000, the Feds actually obtained a warrant for the placement of ANOTHER tracking device on the same car (which, of course, may have ended up being the same device!) WITHOUT telling the judge that a tracking device was already on the car, and had been so since at least as early as April 2000.  Why the subterfuge?  They later used the result of the tracking device (at least, the portion taken after the October warrant) against me in court.  But they continued to conceal the fact that a GPS device had been placed since perhaps April 2000.  Presumably, they concealed that because they would have had to explain, in court, why they were tracking me, without a warrant, and despite the fact that they had no 'probable cause' nor 'reasonable suspicion' to do so.  To conceal that, they obtained the warrant, making it appear that the GPS surveillance started in October 2000.  This was fraud, because in order to obtain a warrant, they have to explain WHY they need the GPS device installed.  Clearly, since a GPS device was already installed in the car, there was no need to place one.  THAT misrepresented the need to the judge.
You might ask, "Jim, why didn't you complain about this during the trial".  As you might know, I was given a long series of lawyers who, rather than being the first line of defense for me, were actually the first line of OFFENCE for the government.  What the average person doesn't understand is that a defense attorney, colluding with the government, has virtually unlimited power to sabotage his client's case, and that was precisely what happened to me.  The crooked attorney was Robert Leen.
And it turned out that the government had a powerful motivation, or at least some of its employees:  They had faked an 'appeal' case in the 9th Circuit, 99-30210, forging at least two filings as if I had done them 'pro se', as if I was bring that case.  I did not, and I wasn't aware of the pre-May 2000 existence of that faked case until June 2003, when I first saw that case's docket.  The crooked attorney who concealed this from me was Jonathan Solovy.             Jim Bell

Yes, jamming ordinary (non-military) GPS would be easy.  The two frequencies involved are: 1.57542 GHz (L1 signal) and 1.2276 GHz (L2 signal).  (The former is the civilian signal; the latter is the military signal.)  The system uses spread-spectrum techniques, but even these can be defeated readily with only very tiny amounts of power.  The ERP (effective radiated power) of the L1 signal is about 250 watts (meaning that the signal is equivalent to an isotropic, or non-directional, radiator emitting 250 watts.)  Due to the inverse-square law, the emissions at 20,200 km altitude are equivalent a signal a trillion times (120 decibels) weaker at a distance of 20,200,000/1,000,000 or 20.2 meters away:  A signal 250 watts/1 trillion is 0.25 nanowatts.  I don't know offhand what the spread-spectrum advantage of the system is, but a nearby signal of 1 microwatt would probably obliterate any received signal.  You will notice that the ratio of the two frequencies, L1 and L2, is very close (about 0.19% difference) to 9:7, being two odd numbers.  This is quite convenient.  What would be needed is a square wave oscillator at a frequency of 1.57542 GHz/9, or  175.04666 Mhz.  This signal, filtered to remove signal much below 1.2 GHz, will emit harmonics at both the L1 and L2 signals.  It's not going to be an especially 'clean' jammer, having spurs also at the 3rd harmonic of 175.04666 MHz as well as the fifth harmonic, as well as the odd harmonics above the 9th.  Making the 175 MHz squarewave would be a simple matter, using a PLL (Phase Lock Loop) frequency multiplier and a lower-frequency crystal.  I think there are probably programmable-frequency oscillators on the market too, although I haven't looked into that in many years.

  From: Cathal Garvey It should be fairly simple to protect against heart-implant hacks.  First, communication with them is probably limited to inductively-coupled signalling, at a fairly high level.  Secondly, it should be based on a two-way challenge/response system:  The external device signals a code, call it a password, to which the implant would respond with a reply, which itself includes a randomized code.  The external device reads that randomized code, processes it in some way (presumably a hash), and retransmits it to the implant.  Only if the implanted device receives what it considers the correct code, would it allow further manipulation.  Presumably, any attempt to illegitimately access such a device wouldn't be close enough to read the implant's reply signals, and thus couldn't proceed further.

Here's my idea for a probe for an RF device.  The wavelength of a 2.45 GHz signal (WiFi) is about 12 cm.  A quarter-wave antenna would be 3 cm.  Or, that 3 cm could be in the form of a loop, at the end of a piece of.'hardline', or other coaxial cable.   (hardline would be best, I think, because it is a small diameter.  )           So, the diameter of the loop would be a bit more than 1 cm diameter, which is appropriate for finding tiny RF sources.  One side of the loop would be connected to the center conductor of the coax, and the other side of the loop connected to the shield of the coax.
Note:  The coax should probably have many dissipative RF beads strung along its length, in order to prevent the cable itself from picking up RF, and delivering to the loop on the end, thereby to be detected.       There are many different kinds of materials that such beads are made from; perhaps we can have an RF engineer chime in on the subject.  He can also tell us if the loop is too-badly mismatched (RF impedence) to the coax to function well.               Jim Bell

"A MOBILE SECURITY RESEARCHER has done his work and found a cluster of vulnerabilities in Android that, when combined, present a problem for 95 percent of the user base.
This is bad stuff. Despite references to unicorns in the official information, there is also some goosebump-inducing wordplay. The official warning is that almost anyone with an Android mobile phone can be sent one text message and be plunged into security chaos.
This threat package has been dubbed Stagefright by Joshua Drake from the security outfit Zimperium zLabs.
"Gaining remote code execution privileges merely by having access to the mobile number? Enter Stagefright. The targets for this kind of attack can be anyone from prime ministers, government officials, company executives, security officers to IT managers," said the firm in a blog post.
"[We] dived into the deepest corners of Android code and discovered what we believe to be the worst Android vulnerabilities discovered to date. These issues in Stagefright code critically expose 95 percent of Android devices, an estimated 950 million devices."

 From: Zenaan Harkness That's the way things were about 25 or so years ago.  Wafers with photoresist were exposed with machines using UV, which over the years used ever-decreasing  wavelengths of UV, in equipment:436. 365nm, and 248nm, eventually reaching 193 nanometer UV.  In the 1970's, entire wafer-masks (which covered the entire wafer) were used.  This became impractical as feature-sizes were reduced.  Step-and-repeat devices ("wafer-steppers)    then allowed exposure of a much smaller portion of a wafer.  (these eventually used mirrors, rather than lenses, because it is hard to process UV in a solid lens.)   
However, because the wavelength of light eventually became a large portion of the size of a chip feature (a line or a space) it was increasingly difficult to 'draw' the picture necessary to expose the resist on the wafer.  Due to many ever-more-heroic technologies, it eventually became possible to use 293 nanometer wavelength to expose features far smaller than the wavelength itself, which would have been considered phenomenal in the 1970's.  These days, EUV ("extreme ultraviolet") has been used for ever more small features.      EUV is strongly absorbed by air, so such exposure is typically done in a vacuum.
None that I'm aware of.  But EUV will take over from electron-beam:  The latter is quite slow, and typically has been used mostly for making masks.

I really don't know about modern EUV lithography.  That's why I cited the Wikipedia article, above.   It has a huge amount of information I haven't been keeping up on.  (I've had excuses...)   It is clearly extremely difficult/expensive to develop, which is in large part why they took so long to go from 193 nm to EUV's 13.5 nm.  Just reading that article is painful.  But they have to do it, because they want to get to feature sizes of 10nm and below.  It takes about 10 'square features' to make a DRAM cell.  A DRAM whose storage array is 1 cm^2 might, in principle, contain 100 billion DRAM cells.                 Jim Bell

@_subject: Encryption article from Yahoo 
By Richard CowanWASHINGTON (Reuters) - As Washington weighs new cybersecurity steps amid a public backlash over mass surveillance, U.S. tech companies warned President Barack Obama not to weaken increasingly sophisticated encryption systems designed to protect consumers' privacy.In a strongly worded letter to Obama on Monday, two industry associations for major software and hardware companies said, "We are opposed to any policy actions or measures that would undermine encryption as an available and effective tool."The Information Technology Industry Council and the Software and Information Industry Association, representing tech giants, including Apple Inc, Google Inc, Facebook Inc, IBM and Microsoft Corp, fired the latest salvo in what is shaping up to be a long fight over government access into smart phones and other digital devices.Obama administration officials, led by the FBI, have pushed the companies to find ways to let law enforcement bypass encryption to investigate illegal activities, including terrorism threats, but not weaken it so that criminals and computer hackers could penetrate the defenses.So far, however, the White House has not spelled out specific regulatory or legislative steps it might seek.View gallery
Some cybersecurity experts are skeptical that Congress will take legislative action to expand the administration's powers anytime soon, noting recent lopsided votes in the House of Representatives to rein in surveillance.White House spokesman Josh Earnest, responding to Reuters' inquiries, said the administration "firmly supports the development and robust adoption of strong encryption."But he added there were concerns about "the use of encryption by terrorists and other criminals to conceal and enable crimes and other malicious activity."FBI'S INTENTIONS KEYKate Martin, director of the Center for National Security Studies, a civil liberties watchdog group, said, "The ultimate question is whether the FBI is going to seek legislation that would put limits on development of encryption tools."View gallery
The Obama administration is in the midst of an internal debate on the matter. Martin said the recent naming of Ed Felten, a computer science and public affairs expert, as deputy U.S. chief technology officer was an indication that Obama "takes seriously the privacy concerns."But at the same time, she noted, "Technology, and especially the globalization of communications, has outpaced U.S. law."The debate over whether there should be limits on encryption should include the question of whether there should be limits on when the government can lawfully get access to people's private information, Martin said.The industry letter to Obama also was sent to FBI Director James Comey, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, Attorney General Loretta Lynch and other Cabinet heads.Days earlier, the United States enacted legislation that will curtail the government's ability to scoop up huge volumes of data related to records of Americans' telephone calls.View gallery
At the same time, Washington is being battered by computer hacks. Last week a massive breach was disclosed at the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, with records of up to 4 million current and former federal employees possibly compromised.An explosion in government surveillance was an outgrowth of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States and was exposed by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.The industry groups noted that online commerce has flourished in part because consumers believed their payment information would be secure."Consumer trust in digital products and services is an essential component enabling continued economic growth of the online marketplace," the industry wrote."Accordingly, we urge you not to pursue any policy or proposal that would require or encourage companies to weaken these technologies, including the weakening of encryption or creating encryption 'work-arounds'."(Additional reporting by Roberta Rampton; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Tom Brown)

  From: "dan at geer.org" The article contains a statement, "Most privacy laws exist to block government actions. A few exist to block private institutional actions. But none exist to block individuals' actions."
Strictly speaking, that is not entirely true.  During the 1960's, I think, laws against recording conversations were promulgated.  This, of course, was the error of the newly-practical transistor.  See the 1974 movie "The Conversation" with Gene Hackman.  Now, I'm not suggesting that such laws were intended for the benefit of the average person:  Rather, I think politicians of that era realized that technology was beginning to allow the recording of their own statements, and they knew this could get very messy for them if this were considered legal.A second example was in the late 1980's, when laws were passed prohibiting radio scanners from receiving the 800-Mhz cell phone frequencies used during that era.  Apparently, people were outraged that their phone calls were not private, so rather than a technological fix, they passed a law prohibiting the manufacture of scanners that received those frequencies.  That was silly, however, because mostly scanners began to be built with pcb cut-options (or component options) which could be easily modified with a soldering iron to re-enable such reception.        Jim Bell

Approximately December 24, perhaps it was 1996, I published an idea on a USENET area (maybe it was SCI.CRYPT) that proposed an idea that clock oscillators used in computers could be frequency-modulated with a long-period pseudo-random (linear feedback shift register) value to smear the output of the signal (and everything that depends on it) over a range of frequencies.Curiously, in early 2007 (When I was at United States Penitentiary, Florence Colorado) I received a letter from a law firm offering me $5,000 for ownership of this idea.  (They had apparently figured out who I was, and had traced me down at my then-current address.)  I presumed that around that time, there was probably a lawsuit challenging a patent on this matter, and the law firm was doing 'due diligence' looking for ammunition.  I counter-offered that if they pay me 1/3 of the value of this idea, I would settle for that.  Never heard back from them.         Jim Bell Computer-stored encryption keys are not safe from side-channel attacks

Not that long ago, grabbing information from air-gapped computers required
sophisticated equipment. In my TechRepublic column Air-gapped computers are
no longer secure, researchers at Georgia Institute of Technology explain how
simple it is to capture keystrokes from a computer just using spurious
electromagnetic side-channel emissions emanating from the computer under
Daniel Genkin, Lev Pachmanov, Itamar Pipman, and Eran Tromer, researchers at
Tel Aviv University, agree the process is simple. However, the scientists
have upped the ante, figuring out how to ex-filtrate complex encryption data
using side-channel technology.
The process In the paper Stealing Keys from PCs using a Radio: Cheap
Electromagnetic Attacks on Windowed Exponentiation (PDF), the researchers
explain how they determine decryption keys for mathematically-secure
cryptographic schemes by capturing information about secret values inside the
computation taking place in the computer.
"We present new side-channel attacks on RSA and ElGamal implementations that
use the popular sliding-window or fixed-window (m-ary) modular exponentiation
algorithms," the team writes. "The attacks can extract decryption keys using
a low measurement bandwidth (a frequency band of less than 100 kHz around a
carrier under 2 MHz) even when attacking multi-GHz CPUs."
If that doesn't mean much, this might help: The researchers can extract keys
from GnuPG in just a few seconds by measuring side-channel emissions from
computers. "The measurement equipment is cheap, compact, and uses
readily-available components," add the researchers. Using that philosophy the
university team developed the following attacks.
Software Defined Radio (SDR) attack: This comprises of a shielded loop
antenna to capture the side-channel signal, which is then recorded by an SDR
program installed on a notebook.
Portable Instrument for Trace Acquisition (PITA) attack: The researchers,
using available electronics and food items (who says academics don't have a
sense of humor?), built the self-contained receiver shown in Figure A. The
PITA receiver has two modes: online and autonomous.
Online: PITA connects to a nearby observation station via Wi-Fi, providing
real-time streaming of the digitized signal.  Autonomous: Similar to online
mode, PITA first measures the digitized signal, then records it on an
internal microSD card for later retrieval by physical access or via Wi-Fi.
Consumer radio attack: To make an even cheaper version, the team leveraged
knowing that side-channel signals modulate at a carrier frequency near 1.7
MHz, which is within the AM radio frequency band. "We used a plain
consumer-grade radio receiver to acquire the desired signal, replacing the
magnetic probe and SDR receiver," the authors explain. "We then recorded the
signal by connecting it to the microphone input of an HTC EVO 4G smartphone."
Cryptanalytic approach
This is where the magic occurs. I must confess that paraphrasing what the
researchers accomplished would be a disservice; I felt it best to include
their cryptanalysis description verbatim:
"Our attack utilizes the fact that, in the sliding-window or fixed window
exponentiation routine, the values inside the table of ciphertext powers can
be partially predicted. By crafting a suitable ciphertext, the attacker can
cause the value at a specific table entry to have a specific structure.
"This structure, coupled with a subtle control flow difference deep inside
GnuPG's basic multiplication routine, will cause a noticeable difference in
the leakage whenever a multiplication by this structured value has occurred.
This allows the attacker to learn all the locations inside the secret
exponent where the specific table entry is selected by the bit pattern in the
sliding window. Repeating this process across all table indices reveals the
Figure B is a spectrogram displaying measured power as a function of time and
frequency for a recording of GnuPG decrypting the same ciphertext using
different randomly generated RSA keys. The research team's explanation:
"It is easy to see where each decryption starts and ends (yellow arrow).
Notice the change in the middle of each decryption operation, spanning
several frequency bands. This is because, internally, each GnuPG RSA
decryption first exponentiates modulo the secret prime p and then modulo the
secret prime q, and we can see the difference between these stages.
"Each of these pairs looks different because each decryption uses a different
key. So in this example, by observing electromagnetic emanations during
decryption operations, using the setup from this figure, we can distinguish
between different secret keys."
Figure B: A spectrogram Image courtesy of Daniel Genkin, Lev Pachmanov,
Itamar Pipman, Eran Tromer, and Tel Aviv University
Any way to prevent the leakage?
One solution, albeit unwieldy, is operating the computer in a Faraday cage,
which prevents any spurious emissions from escaping. "The cryptographic
software can be changed, and algorithmic techniques used to render the
emanations less useful to the attacker," mentions the paper. "These
techniques ensure the behavior of the algorithm is independent of the inputs
it receives."
Interestingly, the research paper tackles a question about side-channel
attacks that TechRepublic readers commented on in my earlier article, "It's a
hardware problem, so why not fix the equipment?"
Basically the researchers mention that the emissions are at such a low level,
prevention is impractical because:
Any leakage remnants can often be amplified by suitable manipulation as we do
in our chosen-ciphertext attack; and Leakage is often an inevitable side
effect of essential performance-enhancing mechanisms.
Something else of interest: the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) considers resistance to side-channel attacks an important
evaluation consideration in its SHA-3 competition.

For an RF-shield, I think that using a microwave oven would be much superior to a refrigerator.  By definition, a microwave oven is designed to contain a huge (1 kilowatt) emission of 2.45 GHz signal (close to those of cell phone frequencies, some are 1700-1900 MHz), so that humans can live with reasonable safety a foot or so away from it.  This implies a shielding of around 60 decibels.I'd keep a container of water inside the microwave cavity to absorb emitted microwave-band signals.  (And, of course, you should detach the power-cord of the microwave, to avoid accidently frying your valuable electronics.)As for smartphones, my understanding is that most of them don't have detachable batteries.  They do, however, have "airplane-mode" function, where (presumably) they are set to not emit any signals in any band.  That doesn't mean they couldn't hear, or record, audio, or detect RF signals, for recording and later transmission.

Maryland) where the Supreme Court upheld the installation of a 'pen register' (a device for recording the numbers which a telephone line calls) on a small number of phone lines.  Correctly, this appeals court rejects the application of the Smith case.  Going from tapping the metadata of perhaps 4-5 lines to that of 100 million lines was too much of a stretch.  Further, the justification in Smith was based in part on the idea that a telephone customer voluntarily gave a phone number to his phone company to complete the call he wanted.A major problem with such a justification today is that while in 1978 (or so) it was necessary to collect and store the 'called-party' number for billing purposes, in 2015 we no longer bill by the mile (as was done by Long Distance accounts in the 1970's and 1980's) or in most cases even the duration of the call.  There is, therefore, no reason for the phone company to even collect the information other than to complete the call, and to keep it only until the time the call ends.  So, trying to use the fact that the customer gives this information to the TPC ("The Phone Company") has become quite tenuous and unnjustifiable.   I recommend to all the 1967 movie, "The President's Analyst", which can be seen to be wonderfully prescient.  True, they cannot (yet) implant telephones in our bodies, but the main limitation on how small those phones can get is maintaining our ability to interact with them, until they become too small for fingers to control.        Jim Bell
quote follows:
"The Supreme Court has also long held, however, that individuals have no“legitimate expectation of privacy in information [they] voluntarily turn[] over tothird parties.”  Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735, 743‐44 (1979); see, e.g., Californiav. Greenwood, 486 U.S. 35 (1988) (no objectively reasonable expectation ofprivacy in garbage exposed to the public by being placed on a sidewalk); UnitedStates v. Miller, 425 U.S. 435 (1976) (no legitimate expectation of privacy in bankrecords).  In Smith v. Maryland, the Court applied that doctrine to uphold theconstitutionality of installing a pen register at a telephone company’s office thatrecorded the numbers dialed from a criminal suspect’s home telephone.  442 U.S.at 737, 745‐46.  The Court held that the installation of the pen register was not a84Case 14-42, Document 168-1, 05/07/2015, 1503586, Page84 of 97 Case 14-42, Document 170, 05/07/2015, 1503607, Page84 of 97search for Fourth Amendment purposes because, by placing calls, individualsexpose the telephone numbers they dial to the telephone company and therefore“assume[] the risk that the company [may] reveal to police thenumbers . . . dialed.”  Id. at 744.  Similarly, it has long been commonplace forgrand juries to subpoena an individual’s telephone records from the individual’stelephone service provider, in the absence of probable cause or a warrant issuedby a judge.  The acquisition of such records, it has been held, implicates nolegitimate privacy interest of the subscriber, because the records are not his orhers alone.  See, e.g., id. at 742‐44; Miller, 425 U.S. at 443; Couch v. United States,409 U.S. 322, 334‐36 (1973).  The subscriber cannot reasonably believe that therecords are private, because he or she has voluntarily exposed the informationcontained in them to the telephone company, which uses them for its ownbusiness purpose of billing the subscriber.The government argues, and the district court held, that this doctrinerequires rejection of appellants’ claim that the acquisition of telephone metadata(as opposed to the contents of communications) violates the Fourth Amendment,or even implicates its protections at all.  Appellants respond that modern85Case 14-42, Document 168-1, 05/07/2015, 1503586, Page85 of 97 Case 14-42, Document 170, 05/07/2015, 1503607, Page85 of 97technology requires revisitation of the underpinnings of the third‐party recordsdoctrine as applied to telephone metadata.Appellants’ argument invokes one of the most difficult issues in FourthAmendment jurisprudence: the extent to which modern technology alters ourtraditional expectations of privacy.  On the one hand, the very notion of anindividual’s expectation of privacy, considered in Katz a key component of therights protected by the Fourth Amendment, may seem quaint in a world in whichtechnology makes it possible for individuals and businesses (to say nothing of thegovernment) to observe acts of individuals once regarded as protected frompublic view.  On the other hand, rules that permit the government to obtainrecords and other information that consumers have shared with businesseswithout a warrant seem much more threatening as the extent of such informationgrows."

@_subject: Karl Rove's confusion about capacity of NSA's Utah data center. 
On Fox News 5/22/2015, Karl Rove displayed his ignorance about the data capacity of the NSA's data center, which he said was intended to store telephone metadata, not the actual audio data from phone calls or (perhaps) the content of emails.   Rove said:  "What it does is, it keeps a record of a phone number that is being called from to a phone number being called to and the date and time. So, unless the Tsarnaev brothers talked to somebody abroad to talked to the phone number of somebody who is identified as a possible terror suspect, they wouldn't -- they wouldn't have been caught by this program whatsoever.And, again, I repeat, why is it that the opponents of Section 215 feel compelled to exaggerate by saying, oh, they're listening to our conversations?""Senator Paul on the floor of the Senate said, oh, they're listening in to thousands -- I mean, to millions of conversations. I mean, if we have to build a gigantic center in Utah to keep track of these phone numbers, how big a center would we need to have in order to keep the digital tapes of everybody who is having a telephone conversation? It simply does not happen."  [end of quote by Rove]Rove is clearly assuming that the size of the data center in Utah is necessary to hold the metadata alone.  The article    states:"An article by Forbes estimates the storage capacity as between 3 and 12 exabytes in the near term, based on analysis of unclassified blueprints, but mentions Moore's Law, meaning that advances in technology could be expected to increase the capacity by orders of magnitude in the coming years."   [3 and 12 exabytes is 3,000-12,000 petabytes, or 3 million-12 million terabytes.]
There are about 900 billion telephone calls made in America per year.  If it took 100 bytes to store the needed metadata per call, that would be 90 terabytes of information needed.  The capacity of the center is, therefore, 33,000x to 131,000x larger than would be needed to store that data for the US alone for one year.  The data stored in a single call could probably be compressed to 8,000 bits per second, so every second would require 80 times as much data to be stored as just the metadata alone.  If the average phone call is 120 seconds, that would require about 9600x the data size, well within even the lower estimate above of 33,000x.So, the answer to Rove's question, "I mean, if we have to build a gigantic center in Utah to keep track of these phone numbers, how big a center would we need to have in order to keep the digital tapes of everybody who is having a telephone conversation? It simply does not happen." is simple:  "No, Karl, The center is just about the right size to store not only the metadata, but in fact the audio to all phone calls made in America in one year.  And in fact, a good deal larger, probably enough to store the audio of every phone call made in Europe as well, and most of Asia."  Would Rove be surprised to hear THAT?!?  Well, he'd probably claim to be surprised.  I suspect he'd defend himself by raising a newly-found fact that at the time that data center in Utah was proposed, hard drives were probably 1000x smaller in capacity than today.  In 2000, as I recall, a typical large hard drive was 2 gigabytes.  Today, the largest I've heard of is 8 terabytes, 4,000x larger.            Jim Bell

To the contrary, I'd say it isn't 'illegal to deceive people'. (in most circumstances.)  First Amendment to the US Constitution and all that.
Further, I'd say that currently the claim Rove made is false, but mostly it became false because the capacity of the hard drives that would be installed in that data center increased by at least a factor of 1000x between the time the data center was proposed (I assume it was around 2001-2002).  At that time, it's possible briefings merely claimed that the system would hold all American metadata, not the actual audio itself.  And I wouldn't expect Fox's journalist to catch that error instantly, either.  It requires a substantial amount of thought, and technical knowledge.  I knew that his claim is wrong, because I'd previously considered the same calculation (very approximately) and I knew that the capacity of the buildings would at least be many hundreds, and in fact thousands, of times larger than would be required for metadata collection.      Jim Bell

Oops!  Error.Somewhere between bits and bytes, I made an error which I identify inline below.  The upshot is the capacity of the NSA data center (in terms of phone calls and time) is actually 10x larger than I'd previously calculated. It could probably hold the telephone audio of much of the world (America, Europe, and most of Asia) for 10 years.           Jim Bell

TRS-80 (Model 1) came with either 4 kilobytes or 16 kilobytes of DRAM, and ran a Z-80 at 1.77 MHz.   Eventually, they included an optional expansion bay that could bring the capacity up to (I think) 48 kilobytes.

Darryl W. Perry Calls for Ross Ulbricht to Be Pardoned
Ross UlbrichtFrom Darryl W. Perry’s 2016 presidential campaign website:In 2013 Ross Ulbricht was arrested for allegedly operating the black market website Silk Road. In early 2015 he was found convicted in what was essentially a kangaroo trial, where his attorney was prevented from presenting evidence of government corruption in the case, because of an ongoing investigation. Two of the federal agents investigating the case have since been arrested for fraud and money laundering.Ulbricht’s lead defense attorney Joshua Dratel wrote in a court filing, “In contrast to the government’s portrayal of the Silk Road web site as a more dangerous version of a traditional drug marketplace, in fact the Silk Road web site was in many respects the most responsible such marketplace in history, and consciously and deliberately included recognized harm reduction measures, including access to physician counseling. In addition, transactions on the Silk Road web site were significantly safer than traditional illegal drug purchases, and included quality control and accountability features that made purchasers substantially safer than they were when purchasing drugs in a conventional manner.”Meghan Ralston, a former harm reduction manager for the Drug Policy Alliance says Silk Roadwas “a peaceable alternative to the often deadly violence so commonly associated with the global drug war, and street drug transactions, in particular.”Despite the improprieties in the investigation and the trial, and despite the fact that Ross Ulbricht actually made the black market safer, he will be in prison for a minimum of 20 years. The Ulbricht family has said they plan to appeal the conviction, however they shouldn’t need to do so. Ross Ulbricht should be pardoned, as should all non-violent drug offenders![end of quote]

World | Fri May 29, 2015 2:59pm EDTEclusive: U.S. tried Stuxnet-style campaign against North Korea but failed - sourcesSAN FRANCISCO | BY JOSEPH MENNThe United States tried to deploy a version of the Stuxnet computer virus to attack North Korea's nuclear weapons program five years ago but ultimately failed, according to people familiar with the covert campaign.The operation began in tandem with the now-famous Stuxnet attack that sabotaged Iran's nuclear program in 2009 and 2010 by destroying a thousand or more centrifuges that were enriching uranium. Reuters and others have reported that the Iran attack was a joint effort by U.S. and Israeli forces.According to one U.S. intelligence source, Stuxnet's developers produced a related virus that would be activated when it encountered Korean-language settings on an infected machine.But U.S. agents could not access the core machines that ran Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program, said another source, a former high-ranking intelligence official who was briefed on the program.The official said the National Security Agency-led campaign was stymied by North Korea's utter secrecy, as well as the extreme isolation of its communications systems. A third source, also previously with U.S. intelligence, said he had heard about the failed cyber attack but did not know details.North Korea has some of the most isolated communications networks in the world. Just owning a computer requires police permission, and the open Internet is unknown except to a tiny elite. The country has one main conduit for Internet connections to the outside world, through China.In contrast, Iranians surfed the Net broadly and had interactions with companies from around the globe.A spokeswoman for the NSA declined to comment for this story. The spy agency has previously declined to comment on the Stuxnet attack against Iran.The United States has launched many cyber espionage campaigns, but North Korea is only the second country, after Iran, that the NSA is now known to have targeted with software designed to destroy equipment.Washington has long expressed concerns about Pyongyang's nuclear program, which it says breaches international agreements. North Korea has been hit with sanctions because of its nuclear and missile tests, moves that Pyongyang sees as an attack on its sovereign right to defend itself.U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said last week that Washington and Beijing were discussing imposing further sanctions on North Korea, which he said was "not even close" to taking steps to end its nuclear program.SIEMENS SOFTWAREExperts in nuclear programs said there are similarities between North Korea and Iran's operations, and the two countries continue to collaborate on military technology.Both countries use a system with P-2 centrifuges, obtained by Pakistani nuclear scientist A.Q. Khan, who is regarded as the father of Islamabad's nuclear bomb, they said.Like Iran, North Korea probably directs its centrifuges with control software developed by Siemens AG that runs on Microsoft Corp's Windows operating system, the experts said. Stuxnet took advantage of vulnerabilities in both the Siemens and Microsoft programs.Because of the overlap between North Korea and Iran's nuclear programs, the NSA would not have had to tinker much with Stuxnet to make it capable of destroying centrifuges in North Korea, if it could be deployed there.Despite modest differences between the programs, "Stuxnet can deal with both of them. But you still need to get it in," said Olli Heinonen, senior fellow at Harvard University's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs and former deputy director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency.NSA Director Keith Alexander said North Korea's strict limitations on Internet access and human travel make it one of a few nations "who can race out and do damage with relative impunity" since reprisals in cyberspace are so challenging.When asked about Stuxnet, Alexander said he could not comment on any offensive actions taken during his time at the spy agency.David Albright, founder of the Institute for Science and International Security and an authority on North Korea's nuclear program, said U.S. cyber agents probably tried to get toNorth Korea by compromising technology suppliers from Iran, Pakistan or China."There was likely an attempt" to sabotage the North Korean program with software, said Albright, who has frequently written and testified on the country's nuclear ambitions.OLYMPIC GAMESThe Stuxnet campaign against Iran, code-named Olympic Games, was discovered in 2010. It remains unclear how the virus was introduced to the Iranian nuclear facility in Natanz, which was not connected to the Internet.According to cybersecurity experts, Stuxnet was found inside industrial companies in Iranthat were tied to the nuclear effort. As for how Stuxnet got there, a leading theory is that it was deposited by a sophisticated espionage program developed by a team closely allied to Stuxnet's authors, dubbed the Equation Group by researchers at Kaspersky Lab.The U.S. effort got that far in North Korea as well. Though no versions of Stuxnet have been reported as being discovered in local computers, Kaspersky Lab analyst Costin Raiu said that a piece of software related to Stuxnet had turned up in North Korea.Kaspersky had previously reported that the software, digitally signed with one of the same stolen certificates that had been used to install Stuxnet, had been submitted to malware analysis site VirusTotal from an electronic address in China. But Raiu told Reuters his contacts had assured him that it originated in North Korea, where it infected a computer in March or April 2010.Some experts said that even if a Stuxnet attack against North Korea had succeeded, it might not have had that big an impact on its nuclear weapons program. Iran's nuclear sites were well known, whereas North Korea probably has at least one other facility beyond the known Yongbyon nuclear complex, former officials and inspectors said.In addition, North Korea likely has plutonium, which does not require a cumbersome enrichment process depending on the cascading centrifuges that were a fat target for Stuxnet, they said.Jim Lewis, an advisor to the U.S. government on cybersecurity issues and a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said there are limitations to cyber offense.A cyber attack "is not something you can release and be sure of the results," Lewis said.[end of quote]

Even most of the very important targets are probably not very well protected, 24 hours per day.  But if they are inaccessible, their employees could be targeted as well.  And their employees will have access to them.

References:   From: grarpamp While the first few collected rewards would probably be in the tens of thousands of dollars range, after a few hundred are collected I think the price could easily drop to the low thousands.  One reason is that once it is clear that government has no effective defense, it will also be clear that soon enough, the government(s) will surely fall.  The main reason a given "special bettor" might hesitate to act is the possibility that he will be stuck in prison, if identified and caught.   But the entire process could be over in just a few months, with the government(s) yelling, "We surrender!".  One condition for that surrender will certainly be the release of all the hostages.  
Another tactic which could be used to strengthen the resolve of potential AP winners is to arrange the bounty system so a portion of all bets also will be used to target anybody who is part of the prosecution of any caught persons, or for that matter anyone who kills or even arrests them:  The judges, prosecutors, and other court staff, as well as hostile witnesses.  Even unsuccessful defense attorneys:  The possible threat of death would provide an automatic appeal issue.  What about a standing publicly-offered reward for $10,000 for any juror who votes to acquit, if that vote doesn't result in a subsequent prosecution.  (And it can't, if the vote is unanimous for acquittal.)  Anyone who holds out for a conviction wouldn't get any money.
 As was stated in the movie Dr. Strangelove,  "Deterrence is the art of producing in the mind of the enemy the FEAR to attack".  If the only tool they have is to prosecute people, make them FEAR to do so and soon enough, they won't dare.  
What is the economics of all this?  Consider that in 2014 a record 3 trillion dollars in taxes was collected by the Federal government.  If those who paid those taxes were willing to donate 1% of that value once, to have it stopped, forever, that would amount to $30 billion.  If the average amount that had to be paid for a single death was $50,000, that would amount to 600,000 deaths.  Does anybody seriously believe that the USG (or any other government, for that matter) would even try to survive such a blow?  Clearly not:  They would resign.

[Quote from Brandenburg:]
The Ohio Criminal Syndicalism Statute was enacted in 1919. From 1917 to 1920, identical or quite similar laws were adopted by 20 States and two territories. E. Dowell, A History of Criminal Syndicalism Legislation in the United States 21 (1939). In 1927, this Court sustained the constitutionality of California's Criminal Syndicalism Act, Cal.Penal Code §§ 11400-11402, the text of which is quite similar to that of the laws of Ohio. Whitney v. California, 274 U.S. 357 (1927). The Court upheld the statute on the ground that, without more, "advocating" violent means to effect political and economic change involves such danger to the security of the State that the State may outlaw it. Cf. Fiske v. Kansas, 274 U.S. 380 (1927). But Whitney has been thoroughly discredited by later decisions. See Dennis v. United States, 341 U.S. 494, at 507 (1951). These later decisions have fashioned the principle that the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action. [n2] As we [p448] said in Noto v. United States, 367 U.S. 290, 297-298 (1961),the mere abstract teaching . . . of the moral propriety or even moral necessity for a resort to force and violence is not the same as preparing a group for violent action and steeling it to such action.See also Herndon v. Lowry, 301 U.S. 242, 259-261 (1937); Bond v. Floyd, 385 U.S. 116, 134 (1966). A statute which fails to draw this distinction impermissibly intrudes upon the freedoms guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. It sweeps within its condemnation speech which our Constitution has immunized from governmental control. Cf. Yates v. United States, 354 U.S. 298 (1957); De Jonge v. Oregon, 299 U.S. 353 (1937); Stromberg v. California, 283 U.S. 359 (1931). See also United States v. Robel, 389 U.S. 258 (1967);Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U.S. 589 (1967); Elfbrandt v. Russell, 384 U.S. 11 (1966); Aptheker v. Secretary of State, 378 U.S. 500(1964); Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360 (1964).Measured by this test, Ohio's Criminal Syndicalism Act cannot be sustained. The Act punishes persons who "advocate or teach the duty, necessity, or propriety" of violence "as a means of accomplishing industrial or political reform"; or who publish or circulate or display any book or paper containing such advocacy; or who "justify" the commission of violent acts "with intent to exemplify, spread or advocate the propriety of the doctrines of criminal syndicalism"; or who "voluntarily assemble" with a group formed "to teach or advocate the doctrines of criminal syndicalism." Neither the indictment nor the trial judge's instructions to the jury in any way refined the statute's bald definition of the crime[p449] in terms of mere advocacy not distinguished from incitement to imminent lawless action. [n3]Accordingly, we are here confronted with a statute which, by its own words and as applied, purports to punish mere advocacy and to forbid, on pain of criminal punishment, assembly with others merely to advocate the described type of action. [n4] Such a statute falls within the condemnation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The contrary teaching of Whitney v. California, supra, cannot be supported, and that decision is therefore overruled.Reversed.

Excuse me for top-posting, but it is my message I'm doing it to, here.  I wanted to add an additional comment.  I take back nothing I said about the Supreme Court case Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969), the case that ruled that it was protected-speech to advocate criminal, even violent activity, except in case of imminent action.  (Say, in a riot.)However, I should point out that legal decisions do occasionally tend to go in and out of favor, particularly when there has been major changes in the makeup of the Supreme Court.  All the positions of the Supreme Court have been replaced, at least once, since the Brandenburg decision was issued.  And some twice.  
If I still had easy access to the process of "Shepardization" of legal decisions    , I could look to see various citations of the Brandenburg case in subsequent Supreme Court cases, to see if it has been limited or modified in any way.  Right now I am unaware of any such changes, but it would be wise to do that Shepardization if you can do so.
Even so, I can agree that given the rather volatile times in which we live, a little caution is still in order.  Perhaps we should call them "Well-funded anonymous unlimited prediction markets."   Well-funded?  Essentially unlimited in amount that can be donated to the prediction fund, and are available to potential predictors.  Anonymous?  Ideally, so that ordinary people could use them without fear that the NSA or GCHQ be able to identify either the donors or the winner of the prediction contest.  Unlimited?  So that there are no relevant restriction placed on these markets:  either externally or internally.  If an individual or individuals want to place a prediction on the death of even the most well-known or politically-correct person, they should be able to do so in unlimited amounts without fear that a government or governments can effectively act to stop that.   And this should be true, even if the operation of individual predictions may seem to be accelerated by external events.
Most importantly, the organization or organizations that run these prediction markets should not be able to reject any proposed prediction market; they should be initiated by individuals outside the organization, and cannot be stopped by the organization itself.
Recently, there was a news item about Microsoft getting involved in Ethereum.      Whatever its role today, I fear that Microsoft would find it more useful to impede the development of  "well-funded anonymous unlimited prediction markets".  In effect, Microsoft might be buying contol of Ethereum, and then using that influence against the development of this vital technology.

      From: jim bell   From: grarpamp While the first few collected rewards would probably be in the tens of thousands of dollars range, after a few hundred are collected I think the price could easily drop to the low thousands.  One reason is that once it is clear that government has no effective defense, it will also be clear that soon enough, the government(s) will surely fall.  The main reason a given "special bettor" might hesitate to act is the possibility that he will be stuck in prison, if identified and caught.   But the entire process could be over in just a few months, with the government(s) yelling, "We surrender!".  One condition for that surrender will certainly be the release of all the hostages.  
Another tactic which could be used to strengthen the resolve of potential AP winners is to arrange the bounty system so a portion of all bets also will be used to target anybody who is part of the prosecution of any caught persons, or for that matter anyone who kills or even arrests them:  The judges, prosecutors, and other court staff, as well as hostile witnesses.  Even unsuccessful defense attorneys:  The possible threat of death would provide an automatic appeal issue.  What about a standing publicly-offered reward for $10,000 for any juror who votes to acquit, if that vote doesn't result in a subsequent prosecution.  (And it can't, if the vote is unanimous for acquittal.)  Anyone who holds out for a conviction wouldn't get any money.
 As was stated in the movie Dr. Strangelove,  "Deterrence is the art of producing in the mind of the enemy the FEAR to attack".  If the only tool they have is to prosecute people, make them FEAR to do so and soon enough, they won't dare.  
What is the economics of all this?  Consider that in 2014 a record 3 trillion dollars in taxes was collected by the Federal government.  If those who paid those taxes were willing to donate 1% of that value once, to have it stopped, forever, that would amount to $30 billion.  If the average amount that had to be paid for a single death was $50,000, that would amount to 600,000 deaths.  Does anybody seriously believe that the USG (or any other government, for that matter) would even try to survive such a blow?  Clearly not:  They would resign.

Note to the ones monitoring:  1969 Supreme Court decision Brandenberg v. Ohio     guarantees as 'protected speech' under the First Amendment even encouragement to others to commit crimes, as long as a riot-type situation is not going on.  There is no riot here, and I haven't encouraged anybody to commit any crime. There is no imminent lawless action anticipated.

[Quote from Brandenburg:]
The Ohio Criminal Syndicalism Statute was enacted in 1919. From 1917 to 1920, identical or quite similar laws were adopted by 20 States and two territories. E. Dowell, A History of Criminal Syndicalism Legislation in the United States 21 (1939). In 1927, this Court sustained the constitutionality of California's Criminal Syndicalism Act, Cal.Penal Code §§ 11400-11402, the text of which is quite similar to that of the laws of Ohio. Whitney v. California, 274 U.S. 357 (1927). The Court upheld the statute on the ground that, without more, "advocating" violent means to effect political and economic change involves such danger to the security of the State that the State may outlaw it. Cf. Fiske v. Kansas, 274 U.S. 380 (1927). But Whitney has been thoroughly discredited by later decisions. See Dennis v. United States, 341 U.S. 494, at 507 (1951). These later decisions have fashioned the principle that the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action. [n2] As we [p448] said in Noto v. United States, 367 U.S. 290, 297-298 (1961),the mere abstract teaching . . . of the moral propriety or even moral necessity for a resort to force and violence is not the same as preparing a group for violent action and steeling it to such action.See also Herndon v. Lowry, 301 U.S. 242, 259-261 (1937); Bond v. Floyd, 385 U.S. 116, 134 (1966). A statute which fails to draw this distinction impermissibly intrudes upon the freedoms guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. It sweeps within its condemnation speech which our Constitution has immunized from governmental control. Cf. Yates v. United States, 354 U.S. 298 (1957); De Jonge v. Oregon, 299 U.S. 353 (1937); Stromberg v. California, 283 U.S. 359 (1931). See also United States v. Robel, 389 U.S. 258 (1967);Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U.S. 589 (1967); Elfbrandt v. Russell, 384 U.S. 11 (1966); Aptheker v. Secretary of State, 378 U.S. 500(1964); Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360 (1964).Measured by this test, Ohio's Criminal Syndicalism Act cannot be sustained. The Act punishes persons who "advocate or teach the duty, necessity, or propriety" of violence "as a means of accomplishing industrial or political reform"; or who publish or circulate or display any book or paper containing such advocacy; or who "justify" the commission of violent acts "with intent to exemplify, spread or advocate the propriety of the doctrines of criminal syndicalism"; or who "voluntarily assemble" with a group formed "to teach or advocate the doctrines of criminal syndicalism." Neither the indictment nor the trial judge's instructions to the jury in any way refined the statute's bald definition of the crime[p449] in terms of mere advocacy not distinguished from incitement to imminent lawless action. [n3]Accordingly, we are here confronted with a statute which, by its own words and as applied, purports to punish mere advocacy and to forbid, on pain of criminal punishment, assembly with others merely to advocate the described type of action. [n4] Such a statute falls within the condemnation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The contrary teaching of Whitney v. California, supra, cannot be supported, and that decision is therefore overruled.Reversed.

 from offering unbreakable encryption under new laws
The UK government is able to do this, in part because UK doesn't have a Constitution,merely a Parliament.   Needless to say, the writers of the Magna Carta didn'thave much familiarity with Internet, or even telephone, television, or telegraph.
It occurs to me there may be at least two workarounds for this:
1.  If there are no restrictions on this, the company providing the encryption might  make its decryption of messages take, say, 10 or more days per message, total  (so if GCHQ asks for 1 message each from 10 sources,, the thing will take 100 days.)Thus, it is technically able to decrypt, satisfying the law, just not fast enough to make
the government happy.
2.  Add hooks to provide for a second layer of encryption, enabled by the choice of the user.The company will be able to decrypt, but the result will appear random.                Jim Bell

By Dustin VolzOpponents of mass surveillance cheered the ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon, who granted an injunction to bar the NSA from collecting the phone metadata of California attorney J.J. Little and his small legal practice.WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge on Monday for the first time ordered the National Security Agency to cease collecting the phone call records of a lawyer and his firm, providing an unprecedented but narrow and largely symbolic victory to privacy advocates.Unlike previous rulings against the NSA's program to vacuum up Americans' call data, which was exposed publicly by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden in 2013, Leon’s opinion does not grant a stay, meaning it will take effect immediately.The decision is of little practical consequence because it is so narrow in scope in covering only Little and his firm.It also comes just weeks before the NSA is scheduled to end its controversial bulk collection program in favor of a more targeted system. That new regime, as mandated by Congress earlier this year, will become active on Nov. 29.But the ruling's language is forceful and represents a win for civil liberties groups concerned that NSA surveillance is too intrusive.Leon wrote that the case may be the last court evaluation of the NSA's bulk metadata collection program."It will not, however, be the last chapter in the ongoing struggle to balance privacy rights and national security interests under our Constitution in an age of evolving technological wizardry," he wrote.On Twitter, Snowden cheered the "historic decision" as one that concluded the NSA “violated Americans’ privacy rights.”Leon, a conservative judge appointed by former President George W. Bush, has long been among the most vocal judges critical of the NSA’s spying practices.Leon said he did not stay his Monday decision “because it has been almost two years since I first found that the NSA’s bulk telephony metadata program likely violates the Constitution."Other plaintiffs in the case, including conservative activist Larry Klayman, who began the lawsuit, were not included in the ruling, due to issues concerning standing.A higher court previously rejected Klayman’s challenge, saying he could not prove his phone was targeted by the NSA as Snowden’s documents only revealed customers of Verizon Business Network Services, which is a subsidiary of Verizon Communications, such as Little, were implicated. Klayman added Little to his case to address the standing concern.

Hillary Clinton Showed How the Government Still Doesn't Understand the Encryption Debate
Every time there is a major terror attack that shocks the international consciousness, there are renewed calls for surveillance and increased policing. And even though we're slowly learning that encryption techniques had nothing to do with the attacks on Paris, politicians are still revitalizing a debate as old as the Internet — whether or not the government should be able to break encryption.
Encryption is the process of taking a message, or any block of text or information, and scrambling it so that it can only be read by the intended recipient. It's baked into many message and email systems automatically, preventing law enforcement from catching the messages in transit and unpacking their contents.
On Thursday, Hillary Clinton called on tech companies to avoid seeing the government as an "adversary" and to "develop solutions that will both keep us safe and protect our privacy" before another attack like Paris occurs.
"Encryption of mobile communications presents a particularly tough problem," Clinton said during a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations last week. "We should take the concerns of law enforcement and counterterrorism professionals seriously. They have warned that impenetrable encryption may prevent them from accessing terrorist communications and preventing a future attack."
Silicon Valley has been vowing in droves to not bend to the political pressure to change their encryption standards. But it's not because they're stubborn, naive or capitalistic. It's because "weakening" encryption is nearly impossible.

(AP Photo/Laurent Cipriani) A crowd near the Eiffel tower a week after the start of the Paris attacks. (AP Photo/Laurent Cipriani) Four days after the Nov. 13 terrorist attacks that shook Paris, Pavel Durov, the founder and CEO of the messaging app Telegram, posted a photo on Instagram of himself on a balcony in France. In the image, he is dressed in black and looking off to the side, the Eiffel Tower in the background framing his stoic expression. If you saw it at a glance, you’d think it was a tribute to the mourning nation. But then there’s this caption: “I think the French government is as responsible as ISIS for this, because it is their policies and carelessness which eventually led to the tragedy,” it reads. “They take money away from hardworking people of France with outrageously high taxes and spend them on waging useless wars in the Middle East and on creating [a] parasitic social paradise for North African immigrants. It is a disgrace to see Paris in the hands of shortsighted socialists who ruin this beautiful place.” Though otherwise confusing, the statement made one thing clear: Durov would rather blame the tragedy that had befallen Paris on French taxes than call attention to the way members of the Islamic state have taken to using his encrypted messaging app to communicate.

Congress could also interpose any sorts of new restrictions on what this money can be spent for, meaning that any prior directives by Congress (especially by a Democrat-controlled Congress) would be null and void.  Effectively, Congress could completely re-write the budget without approval by either the Democrats or Obama.

  From: Georgi Guninski A typical microwave oven is a 1-kilowatt source of 2.45 GHz radio signals, generated by a device called a "magnetron tube", which is itself fed from a source of about 4000 volts and 0.3 amps, stepped up by a transformer from the AC supply.  Usually, the  power is fed into a box with metal walls, which is easy, but has a front door which is easily closeable yet has excellent shielding ability when closed.  Such microwave ovens are carefully designed so that they will not generate microwaves when the door is open:  To do so would expose the user to microwaves far above the safe level.  Now, if your intent is to do damage, you could bypass the safety features of the door, and partly disassemble the oven so as to feed the as-generated microwaves into a waveguide (sometimes it's a hollow rectangular tube) which proceeds to the antenna, which is often at the focus of a parabolic dish.  Generally, the rule is the larger the dish, the more focussed the microwaves will be.  An 8-foot diameter dish would be excellent, perhaps giving 30 db of gain over an isotropic.  There are formulae for calculating gain vs. dish size vs. wavelength easily found on the web.     or the Radio Amateur's Handbook.
However, for REAL damage, it would be useful to pulse the kilovolts into the magnetron:  Generally if you increase the voltage by 10, the power increases by 100.  Feed that microwave magnetron with brief (microseconds) pulses of 40,000 volts, rather than 4000, and it will probably generate close to 100 kilowatts.  It would be necessary to establish that such a system will not arc with over-voltage, either within the waveguide or the associated high-voltage wiring.  Much of the electronics within a building would be fried if such a beam is pointed at it.

Sorry, but you are wrong there.  The amount of power available through a typical USB connection is probably many hundreds of milliamps, at 5 volts.  And this power could be converted, by a switching power supply, to hundreds or even thousands of volts, and stored in an internal capacitor.  Once switched on, internally, and applied back to the data signals, the device could easily fry a few levels of circuitry in the computer.  It would be essentially unrepairable.

I don't know about the specific products you mentioned, but it would be trivial to build an intermediate product to protect the products from each other.  USB consists of four connections:  GND, V+, and two datas.  Aside from adding some intermediate series resistors of relatively low value, perhaps a few tens of ohms., diodes (silicon rectifier and perhaps Zener) would easily shunt over-voltages and block them.  Obviously, there would be a limit to what a given protection system would protect against:  Apply a 1000-volt, 10-amp power supply between V+ and ground, and SOMETHING is going to die!  But the 'threat model' is far simpler for real-world dangers.
The tricky part is that you are supposed to be able to USE the power provided through the V+ pin for external devices.  That's a convenience, but it is also somewhat of a danger.  Who knows how much protection is already built-in to a typical computer's USB ports?  A good 1000-volt PIV silicon diode in series with V+ would prevent an external circuit from forcing positive current into that pin.  Similarly, another 1-amp diode, connected to the V+ and GND, backwards, would prevent V+ from being pulled appreciably below ground.  Placing a 20 ohm resistor outboard of these diodes would limit current flow, etc.  The trick is that you might want to use the entire capability of voltage and current from that USB port, without IR (voltage loss over a resistor or diode) loss.  
There are also devices called "opto-isolators" (also called "opto-couplers") which could be used to provide well over 1000 volt isolation to the data signals themselves.                 Jim Bell, N7IJS

After months of development, we are proud to release our alpha version of Augur. This version showcases the basic features of our prediction market implementation. It's by no means feature complete and certainly prone to bugs.Tell us what you think and report any issues you have using the "Feedback" link in the app.

Apparently they work on the principle that if decisions are made using a lot of input (many members of the public).   The PAM (Policy Analysis Market    ) proposal from 2003 was intended to work on the same principle.  (The media quickly labelled it, "terrorism futures".)   Presumably if 'enough' of the crowd change the prediction, that will be for good reason if they have to burn 'reputation' too.
If that was indeed what a crowdsourced prediction market was attempting to do, it would fail.  But that is not the case.  
Since augur mentions "market", likely the lovely NSA can put a lot of
bots on it, possibly just burning inflated virtual money.
I'm not sure I understand what may be your objection, but my understanding is that the Ethereum system is intended to be supported by means of some micropayment system, called 'ether'.  .  A DOS (denial of service) attack won't work if those attacking have to pay a small fee to communicate with the system.  
Presumably Augur will be doing that, too.  Naturally, I can think of better things for a prediction market to be doing!!!             Jim Bell

If the NSA decides to fuck a prediction, they can buy
ether and their bots will do the rest.
Probably not.  I assume that the people who are implementing Ethereum have to (or, at least, want to) justify the existence of that proposed system somehow.  One analogy is with sports-betting systems, which have been attacked by law in various jurisdictions.  This amounts to their 'cover-story'.  Crop insurance, ordinary life insurance, and other examples of insurance would apply as well.  
Prediction markets can be structured in (at least) two ways:  One, in which the current status of the prediction is kept known, for instance what the Policy Analysis Market was apparently intended to do.  ("Bet on the probability of a bombing attack at an embassy in Beirut during a given week").  In such a system, everybody can see the value of such a prediction coming true, varying up and down in amount over time.  The second, such as my AP essay, where the predictions are kept carefully secret until after the prediction comes true.  One potential weakness is that people might tend to game the system, concealing the death of a person, or alternatively, faking his death.  I can certainly see that there is a reason to turn things into futures-type market, as long as information about the predictions can be kept secret for long enough (days) to not give non-special predictors a hint as to the outcome, early.             Jim Bell

If even a single hitman had been hired, by a single customer, and proceeded to kill even a single target, things would look very different on all subsequent days.  If Sanjuro's "Assassination Market" taught us anything, it is that the public is quite ready for a fully-functioning AP-type system, whether it be based on Tor, Ethereum, Augur, or any other such mechanism.

References:   From: Zenaan Harkness Here's the show and plot:
Liz (Megan Boone) is jubilant to learn the president has commissioned an investigation that could clear her name, but Red (James Spader) is desperate to get on the move. It seems mythical vigilante assassin Wendigo has Liz in his sights. Unfortunately, after Red tracks down Wendigo and drops him off a roof, the bullets keep coming, which is when Liz realizes there's a crowd-sourced bounty on her head on the dark web. Red asks the FBI to help keep her safe, and Aram (Amir Arison) tracks down the bounty site's webmaster, who claims they'll need the creator of the original post, Arioch Cain, to delete it once and for all. Meanwhile, Red and Liz wait for Dembe (Hisham Tawfiq) in a Manhattan Park. Instead, Mr. Vargas (Paul Reubens) shows up to explain Dembe's dead, then lures the couple to Red's hangar where Solomon (Edi Gathegi) and his men wait in ambush. All seems lost until Dembe struts in, guns blazing. Solomon escapes, and just as Red puts a final bullet in Vargas, Dembe collapses from his own wounds.According to Aram, the only way to get Liz off the bounty hunter site is to kill her, so Red summons Mr. Kaplan to fake her death. Then Liz and Red follow the money to discover the bounty poster, a young girl who lost her mother in the OREA bombing. Liz promises to find the men who killed her mother and the girl deletes the post. Liz is safe... for now.Meanwhile, at Asher's engagement party to fiancée Gwen, Tom (Ryan Eggold) learns his new friend is indebted to the tune of $20,000 weekly to Russian mobster Garik Sarkissian. Sensing an opportunity, Tom inserts himself, and all is well until Gwen spies Sarkissian's corpse in the trunk of Tom's car. Things aren't going well for Ressler (Diego Klattenhoff), either. After testifying at the presidential investigation hearing presided over by Chairwoman Laurel Hitchin (Christine Lahti), Wright (Adriane Lenox) orders him to share all information regarding Liz and Red with the Director (David Strathairn) henceforth.[end of quote]

assholes. But serious assholes are seriously hard to kill.
If they are truly "serious assholes" then they will piss off large numbers of people.  That means many people will be donating to see them stop it.  More people donating means a smaller donation per person will be sufficient.
In order for governments to kill their enemies, they first must know who their enemies are.  Merely by remaining silent, for awhile, a person can conceal himself as an "enemy" of governments.  They can use AP to get rid of those governments, silently.

  From: intelemetry To the extent that crime presents a problem that needs to be solved, there is no reason that private organization can't exist to detect crime, and then prove it to an excellent standard.  Those who commit crimecan be presented with a choice:  make your victim whole, and/or accept preventive confinement, or earn a bounty on an AP-type system.  
Your idea is effectively crowdsourcing, which in many ways could be
very useful for Friedman's hard problem. However, while remaining
purely voluntary in nature, what differentiates your assassination
market from:
    - taxes (compulsory collection of small amounts from many)
Taxes are, as you pointed out, compulsory.  Donating to an AP-type system won't be compulsory.  But potential criminals won't know who is donating, andwho is not donating.  And it will probably not matter:  Most people, out of a sense of self-protection, will donate to such crime-prevention and detection funds,because they will amount to a deterrent against all criminals. 
    - hits (a few wealthy individuals take out a contract)
Moreover, you still are facing the 'free-rider' problem, where, "if
everybody else in my community payed a dollar to kill this guy, why
should I have to do so, it is only -1 dollar.
I don't think 'free riders' will be much of a problem.  For one thing, I think the system (AP) will be vastly more efficient than the convention crimeprotection system.  (in the same way that military defense could be 100xcheaper.
I hope that someday, in the future, technology will advance to the point where transcripts to 55-minute videos can be automatically generated.  I can alreadysee that Murphy speaks rapidly, but I could easily read the transcript 10x as fast as he can speak it.  By pointing to that video, you are effectively asking me to employ 55 minutes of my life on something which you say will merely "set the context".

I will explain to you why selecting Murphy to support any arguments you have is misguided.   Here is a paragraph from his essay, itself a response to his business partner, Robert Vroman, at:     I will first quote the whole paragraph, and then address it inline:
   "Simply put, I don't think Vroman or Bell realize just how nutty and horrible the AP idea seems to the average American. Especially if the government institutes a standing penalty of, say, a mandatory twenty-five years for placing an AP donation, I don't think we will have the millions of small donations that AP requires. The situation would be a prisoner's dilemma: No individual donation of $10 or even $100 is going to make the difference between a target being killed or not, and so there would be no reason for the average person to use AP. The fact that the donations could be made "safely" is not enough; the government would surely institute eavesdropping measures and would punish anyone who even visited AP sites.
My replies inline:
Simply put, I don't think Vroman or Bell realize just how nutty and horrible the AP idea seems to the average American.
I should point out why I view Murphy's comment as being wacky, in itself.  The "average American" is fairly familiar with the deficiencies of the world's status quo.   But he may not be aware that it has been estimated that in the 20th century, about 250 million people DIED, killed by the actions of governments.        Does Murphy impllicitly or explicitly say that is somehow "okay"?  I very much doubt he'd say that was acceptable, and he probably couldn't argue much with the numbers themselves.  But suppose those "average Americans" were FIRST fully informed of this fact, even simply as an estimate.  THEN, suppose it was explained to him HOW a functioning AP system wouldn't allow that to happen, if necessary by killing whatever number of government employees were necessary to stop this, the "Democide".   If those "average Americans" were reminded that the death of a government employee is no more unfortunate than the death of ordinary citizens, then wouldn't it be reasonable to conclude that to save 250 million ordinary citizens, it would certainly be acceptable to kill 25 million government employees, and certainly 2.5 million government employees?
The "average American" has been aware, during and since the 1960's, that the citizens of many major governments have been under a nuclear terror.  Now, it seems, we simply accept it as it is a reality.  As shocking as that may see, perhaps it's made more understandable by the fact that there has not seemed to be anything we can do about it.  
Suppose, then, these "average Americans" were told that a functioning AP system would make any nation's holding of nuclear weapons absolutely impossible:  They are in the control of SOMEONE, or maybe hundreds and thousands of someones, and such people can be targeted by AP until those weapons are finally shut down, and dismantled, and permanently rendered safe.  As many government employees could be killed until that occurs.  No limit whatsoever.  
So, where does Bob Murphy get off saying that the "Average American" would find AP "nutty and horrible"?  I say, to the contrary, that a _well-informed_ "average American", informed of what I say AP could accomplish, would find Murphy himself and his arguments "nutty and horrible".  Why should the citizens of the world tolerate the killing of 250 million more people by governments, beyond the 20th Century's toll?  Why should the citizens of the world tolerate continuing to be held as nuclear hostages, targets of 2000 nuclear bombs, just to keep a few governments in power?  Clearly, Murphy views the world's citizens' "natural state" to being owned and held hostage by governments, and certainly not the opposite!
                         " Especially if the government institutes a standing penalty of, say, a mandatory twenty-five years for placing an AP donation, I don't think we will have the millions of small donations that AP requires. The situation would be a prisoner's dilemma: No individual donation of $10 or even $100 is going to make the difference between a target being killed or not, and so there would be no reason for the average person to use AP. The fact that the donations could be made "safely" is not enough; the government would surely institute eavesdropping measures and would punish anyone who even visited AP sites."
Murphy, here, is beginning to show his 'inner paranoid'.  "They would never let us do it!!!"Which, is one reasons we MUST do it.   I would say, to the contrary of what he said, that if "they", the governments, don't want us to do something SO MUCH, then that's all the more reason we should disregard those governments' official desires.                    Jim Bell

@_subject: Bitnation system.  Looks interesting. 
It's in Russian.Here is the automatic translation:
Bitnation released blokcheyn system of public administration
BY IMPGUN on 2015/06/04 • (53)Bitnation, project development blokcheyn system of public administration 2.0, headed by charismatic founder Suzanne Tarkovsky-Templhof (Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof), released an alpha version of the platformBitnation Pangea. The release is version 0.1.0, and can not boast of stability and broad functionality, but it is based on the idea of a truly revolutionary and can have important consequences.«Bitnation - an operating system for the public administration 2.0, designed to undermine the oligopoly of nation states due to more convenient, secure and cost-effective management services, - said Bitcoin Magazine Templhof Tarkovsky, who worked for many years in various troubled regions of the world. - As the world due to globalization leaves the current paradigm of the nation-state, it is possible to implement a completely new solution that enables service providers to many competing public administration to take the place of states which for centuries maintained its geographical monopoly violent means. "Developers Bitnation Pangea want to create a platform for the world's first nation to blokcheyne that would provide all the services of traditional states and replace them with voluntary communities. The ultimate goal Bitnation - to create a new world in which everyone will be able to choose their nation, few nations do not choose none at all, or even create their own nation on the platform Bitnation.
"The alternative, which is now leaning to the world - a global organization in the spirit of the United Nations that the management plan will be even worse than the current structures, because they will try to mow one size fits all - says Tarkovsky-Templhof. - We strive to Bitnation prevent this development by creating an environment of competing service providers using blokcheyn Bitcoin - in fact, to develop a protocol kriptonatsy open source. "
The core platform consists of a system for tracking identity and reputation (passport Bitnation), of dispute resolution, the notary and libraries (decentralized) management applications in the style of "do it yourself", with which users can create, upload to the network, spread in share or sell their own (decentralized) management applications. The plans - services for marriages and wills, contracts for child care, birth certificates of land ownership, the establishment of corporations and trade interests in them, unemployment insurance and health insurance, pensions, security and diplomatic services.Alpha release, which is updated in real time in response to user feedback in discussion groups Bitnation, already includes some interesting features such as the ability to register blokcheyne document with a time stamp.Previous pilot projects include Bitnation first marriage registered in blokcheyne, and first-blokcheyn passport. Bitnation also developed land registry and successfully tested it in Ghana, where 70% of the land is not registered any property rights, which discourages investment and lending on the security of land.After studying many blokcheyn protocols developers Bitnation for the release of the first release of Pangea joined forces with the founders of Project Horizon and Blocknet. The alpha version used blokcheyn Horizon, but the technology will support Blocknet and other blokcheynov. According to Tarkovsky-Templhof, future releases will not be limited Pangea blokcheynami altkoynov, and be able to use blokcheyn Bitcoin, which should positively influence the prospects of the project.
«Bitnation - it is a truly innovative concept, and we are pleased to provide them with a platform for development - said Arlene Kalvik (Arlyn Culwick), one of the project participants Blocknet. - We believe that providing interaction blokcheynov, Blocknet will help unlock the full potential of blokcheyn technologies. "«Bitnation - a revolutionary idea, which we believe will radically change the world for the better - said Tarkovsky-Templhof in the previous press release. - And yet, as we are the first one who really tries to challenge the relevance of the construct of nation-states to implement existing ideas is sometimes not easy. "
One of the main problems is the financing of the project, so the group Bitnation, which until recently largely relied on the efforts of volunteers willing to accept moderate investment by business angels, to create a more solid basis for development.Giulio Prisco (Guilio Prisco), May 20, 2015Source: bitcoinmagazine.com

I think you're wrong about that.  It isn't "the same spam page".  Rather, it is multiple copies of what amounts to (looks like, to the human eye) the same spam page, but located at different URLs.
 >   In other words, google is such an incredible piece of shit that
Again, I think you're wrong about that.  I don't think Google has done anything wrong, here.  Rather, I think that someone else has manufactured many pages which look alike to the human eye, but apparently contain hidden text that can be searched for and found.  Google-search has simply catalogued the search results, including the otherwise-invisible text.  (White characters on a white background can't be read by eye, but they can be read by Google-search.)
 >   has a 'market cap' of 428 000 million dollars...
Again, I think you're wrong.  What I believe I have seen does not "work against" anybody, except possibly me.  Google is simply cataloguing the web pages it sees, as the person (or organization) that produced those pages intends.  The only negative consequence, to Google-search, is that they have to catalog a few hundred kilobytes more of web-pages.  That's no skin off Google-search's nose.  And as far as I understand, the only tricky thing here is that text is present on these pages which cannot be read by a human.  If I knew more about the Web than I do, I would probably understand how to adjust my web browser to display visibly what would otherwise be invisible text.  The next question is, "what does this mean, and who produced this, and why?".   I posted this query to find somebody who had experience in SEO techniques.

I think you're wrong about that.  It isn't "the same spam page".  Rather, it is multiple copies of what amounts to (looks like, to the human eye) the same spam page, but located at different URLs.

Again, I think you're wrong about that.  I don't think Google has done anything wrong, here.  Rather, I think that someone else has manufactured many pages which look alike to the human eye, but apparently contain hidden text that can be searched for and found.  Google-search has simply catalogued the search results, including the otherwise-invisible text.  (White characters on a white background can't be read by eye, but they can be read by Google-search.)
 >   has a 'market cap' of 428 000 million dollars...
Again, I think you're wrong.  What I believe I have seen does not "work against" anybody, except possibly me.  Google is simply cataloguing the web pages it sees, as the person (or organization) that produced those pages intends.  The only negative consequence, to Google-search, is that they have to catalog a few hundred kilobytes more of web-pages.  That's no skin off Google-search's nose.  And as far as I understand, the only tricky thing here is that text is present on these pages which cannot be read by a human.  If I knew more about the Web than I do, I would probably understand how to adjust my web browser to display visibly what would otherwise be invisible text.  The next question is, "what does this mean, and who produced this, and why?".   I posted this query to find somebody who had experience in SEO techniques.

Has anyone heard of an idea to use individual WiFi routers to communicate in a mesh net?  (Or, at least differently than it may have been done before.)   If you look at a map of WiFi routers ( in any given area, you will see that the vast majority of routers are physically close to many other routers, certainly close enough to communicate with each other, and ultimately over a long distance.  A crowd-sourced communication system, one that wouldn't necessarily go through the Internet backbone.  Conceptually related to the Bittorrent system.    I just  found this:   
            Jim Bell
"Wi-Fi Direct, initially called Wi-Fi P2P, is a Wi-Fi standard enabling devices to easily connect with each other without requiring a wireless access point.[1] It is usable for everything from internet browsing to file transfer,[2][3] and to communicate with more than one device simultaneously at typical Wi-Fi speeds.[4] One advantage of Wi-Fi Direct is the ability to connect devices even if they are from different manufacturers. Only one of the Wi-Fi devices needs to be compliant with Wi-Fi Direct to establish a peer-to-peer connection that transfers data directly between them with greatly reduced setup.[citation needed]
Wi-Fi Direct negotiates the link with a Wi-Fi Protected Setup system that assigns each device a limited wireless access point. The "pairing" of Wi-Fi Direct devices can be set up to require the proximity of a near field communication, a Bluetooth signal, or a button press on one or all the devices. Wi-Fi Direct may not only replace the need for routers, but may also replace the need of Bluetooth for applications that do not rely on low energy.[5]"

References: <20150916090105.GA2571
 >From: Georgi Guninski This brings me back to my stint at Intel, 1980-82, as a new Product Engineer for the 2186, an 8kx8 pseudostatic (self-refreshing dynamic) RAM. (One of the first DRAMs to use redundancy to increase yield.)  I may have been the first engineer in the world to see, through a microscope focused on a DRAM chip, a very quick series of flashes, evidence of the programming (blowing) silicon fuses on the chip, to program the row- and column-redundancy information.
 Product engineers were, and presumably still are, responsible for writing test programs to run chips through their paces, in Intel's case using a Teradyne computer.       I don't think the concept of this kind of weakness is new:  Even in 1980, DRAMs were tested for such repeated accesses, to ensure that such errors would not occur.  This was particularly true for a process called "device characterization", in which chips were attacked in all manner of electronically-abusive ways, to uncover these weaknesses, and fix the circuit design should such flaws be uncovered. One way these techniques could be thwarted is to return to the use of parity-bits (8+1 parity) in memory access, in DRAM module and computer design, to whatever extent they are no longer used.  Any (successful) attempt to modify bits in a DRAM would quickly end up causing a parity error, which would at least show which manufacturer's DRAM chips are susceptible to this kind of attack.  A person who was forced to use a no-parity computer could, at least,  limit his purchases of such modules to those populated with DRAMs not susceptible to the problem.           Jim Bell

References:   From: grarpamp Some paper has said systems using ECC RAM are resistant / immune
to rowhammer.
There is still a fair bump in cost for ECC system
however once you've seen your first syslog entry
you forget about the cost. Regardless of rowhammer.
You're right, ECC would be even better.  ECC should, indeed, be essentially immune from rowhammer, and will correct it and all other sorts of single-bit errors, and they will generally detect all double-bit errors.   However, as you pointed out ECC is presumably much more costly than mere parity bits, not in the least because they have to use more bits of storage.  As I vaguely recall, 8 data bits had to be coupled with 4 ECC bits; 16 data/5ECC; 32 data/6 ECC; 64 data/7 ECC; 128 data/8 ECC.  This shows that ECC is much more efficient, as word width goes up, which in principle would make its cost penalty easier to take. I haven't been keeping up with DRAM technology like I did in the 70's, 80's, and 90's, but I am not aware if ECC is being easily implemented inside DRAM chips.  There was a very early Micron Technology 64Kbit DRAM that, as I recall, had this internal to individual DRAM chips, but it didn't last very long in competition with the jellybean parts.  Even more than the cost, I think that ECC added (and maybe still adds) an access-time penalty.  Generally, parity-only shouldn't add access time delays.  One obscure issue is that if the external memory system detects an error (either parity or ECC), can the microprocessor be instructed to "back up" and reject the recently-acquired byte/word?  Most early microprocessors didn't have that ability, which I believe is why those systems had to "wait" for the parity or ECC to be generated and checked.          Jim Bell

i>ssue, not really trying to derive any conclusions. I chatted a bit
 Not exactly.  Generally, ECC with enough correction bits will at least detect all double-bit errors, although it will not correct those errors.  And I can't say for sure how generally this is in use, but I think a competently-designed ECC system will use the regular refresh cycles to "sweep" for correctable single-bit errors, and correct virtually all of them, before they turn into double-bit errors.
However, the profusion of corrected single-bit can be used to alert, and uncorrectable double-bit errors will probably cause  a system exception that will inform the system operator that something is going on.
Remember, it is likely that different manufacturer's DRAM designs might differ in sensitivity to rowhammer (or other deliberate failure mode) by a factor of 10:1, 100:1, or even 1000:1.   The word can, and will, quickly get out what manufacturers sensitivity is, and the market will quickly result in improvement for designs and thus, new systems.           Jim Bell

References: Again, I must disagree.  Rowhammer errors are, presumably, exceedingly rare.  But when they do occur, one-bit errors are probably millions of times more common than two-bit errors, which are themselves going too be millions of times more common than three bit errors..  But ECC accesses will automatically correct all one-bit errors, and detect all two-bit errors, and will either log only the 2-bit errors or both single and double-bit errors.  I won't try the math, but I suspect that the vast majority of three-bit errors (for 64-bit words) are also detected.   Wikipedia says     , "Parity allows the detection of all single-bit errors (actually, any odd number of wrong bits)".    So, the smallest number of error bits that might not be detected would be four.
 Since any serious rowhammer attack will generate millions of correctable single-bit and uncorrectable double- and triple-bit errors, per actual single 4-bit error, any system operator will get a huge amount of warning that the attack is underway before even as many as a single 3-bit error will appear.             Jim Bell
This came from Wikipedia:      
"Work published between 2007 and 2009 showed widely varying error rates with over 7 orders of magnitude difference, ranging from 10−10–10−17 error/bit·h, roughly one bit error, per hour, per gigabyte of memory to one bit error, per millennium, per gigabyte of memory.[4][5][6] A very large-scale study based on Google's very large number of servers was presented at the SIGMETRICS/Performance’09 conference.[5] The actual error rate found was several orders of magnitude higher than previous small-scale or laboratory studies, with 25,000 to 70,000 errors per billion device hours per megabit (about 2.5–7 × 10−11 error/bit·h) (i.e. about 5 single bit errors in 8 Gigabytes of RAM per hour using the top-end error rate), and more than 8% of DIMM memory modules affected by errors per year.
The consequence of a memory error is system-dependent. In systems without ECC, an error can lead either to a crash or to corruption of data; in large-scale production sites, memory errors are one of the most common hardware causes of machine crashes.[5] Memory errors can cause security vulnerabilities.[5] A memory error can have no consequences if it changes a bit which neither causes observable malfunctioning nor affects data used in calculations or saved. A 2010 simulation study showed that, for a web browser, only a small fraction of memory errors caused data corruption, although, as many memory errors are intermittent and correlated, the effects of memory errors were greater than would be expected for independent soft errors.[7]
Some tests conclude that the isolation of DRAM memory cells can be circumvented by unintended side effects of specially crafted accesses to adjacent cells. Thus, accessing data stored in DRAM causes memory cells to leak their charges and interact electrically, as a result of high cells density in modern memory, altering the content of nearby memory rows that actually were not addressed in the original memory access. This effect is known as row hammer, and it has also been used in some privilege escalation computer security exploits.[8][9]
An example of a single-bit error that would be ignored by a system with no error-checking, would halt a machine with parity checking, or would be invisibly corrected by ECC: a single bit is stuck at 1 due to a faulty chip, or becomes changed to 1 due to background or cosmic radiation; a spreadsheet storing numbers in ASCII format is loaded, and the digit "8" is stored in the byte which contains the stuck bit as its eighth bit; then a change is made to the spreadsheet and it is saved. However, the "8" (00111000 binary) has silently become a "9" (00111001)."

  From: Georgi Guninski I assume POC means "proof of concept".  Yes, the error is non-deterministic.  It arises from the fact that bits are stored as different voltages on individual capacitors in a chip, one capacitor per bit.   Think of a "0" as being zero volts, 1 is Vcc volts, where Vcc (the supply voltage to the chips) is usually 3 volts.  This represents a healthy difference, and could easily be detected.  The problem is that the chip can't have one voltage detector for each bit; usually there are about 1048 bits per voltage comparator.  When a given row needs to be read, the Row Address line activates, and those 1048 bits are each connected to their corresponding "bit line", which is a tiny electrical conductor with a capacitance much greater than that of the individual bit-cell (capacitor).  The resulting voltage difference between a "one" and a "zero" bit might be only a few tens of millivolts, which is rather small.  Then, the voltage detector amplifies the voltage difference, to restore it to either GND (0 volts) or Vcc.
It's statistical.  Probably  the number of failures will be approximately proportional to the number of disturb-cycles done.
Perhaps just a little.  Refreshing of an entire memory array is done once each 64 millisecond.  (Used to be 2 millisecond in the 1970s.)    It is said that many tens of seconds can elapse before any given bit is disturbed, if refresh is turned off.  There should be a lot of margin for loss of refresh, or an inadequate amount of refresh.
I don't think an external attack (with particles) is plausible.

Within the last couple of months, I think somebody was arrested for planning some sort of "X-ray death ray".      But only a dweeb doesn't know that X-rays cannot be focussed.  (With one very obscure exception not applicable here.  Find it and get an "attaboy!". )
Microwaves, OTOH, can be focussed rather easily.  The frequency is 2.45 Ghz, at about 1 Kilowatt.  (wavelength about 12 centimeters.)  I'd have to consult a Radio Amateur's handbook, but a modern dish (intended or Directv or Dish network) could probably get 15-20 db of gain, compared with isotropic.  An old-style 8-foot dish probably would do 30 db gain.  That would be 100 kilowatts ERP.
Such an unshielded  (open) device would probably impair WiFi at 2.5 Ghz severely, if you're close to it, say a few hundred feet away.  Fortunately, I think microwave ovens have better than 60 db of shielding.  A few 10s of feet, away, hardware damage might occur if that full 1 kw were allowed to leak out.           Jim Bell
Ordinary microwave ovens are probably 75%-80% efficient.  Thus, if you need to supply a 1 kilowatt microwave, you'll probably need 1250 watts of AC power.

The Department of Homeland Security is funding a Boeing company to create a "brain chip" for its self-destructing Black smartphone that could be adapted for any device, DHS officials say.The technology powering the devices potentially could identify the user’s walking style, for example. Officials would be alerted if the gait does not match the authorized user’s walk – a red flag the phone might have fallen into the wrong hands, officials said. The "secret sauce" of the mobile device is a so-called neuromorphic computer chip that simulates human learning, Vincent Sritapan, the program manager for DHS' mobile device security program, told Nextgov.Gait recognition -- driven by the phone's accelerometer, GPS and the chip -- is but one of many kinds of continuous ID verification intended to tighten access controls on mobile devices.   Boeing and HRL Laboratories, a software firm jointly owned by Boeing and General Motors, are partnering under a DHS project worth $2.2 million over 2.5 years. The companies "pretty much are leveraging user behavior information" from data gathered by sensors found on any standard consumer smartphone, Sritapan said. Those feelers could include microphones, cameras and touchpads, he added. The artificial intelligence could help agencies determine, “Are you who you say you are, and do we give you access to enterprise resources like email?” he said.Homeland Security chose the Boeing Black for experimentation, because the company was willing to embed the chip into its device, Sritapan said."I would call this a high-risk, high-reward type of project," he added. "If successful, this technology can go into any device the manufacturers are willing to integrate it with" and would meet military, DHS and other federal agency information security specifications. Referring to the Black as "the test body," he said the government purchased the brand for "specific uses," such as secure voice calls. Smartphone as Test TubeIt remains to be seen whether DHS itself will buy brain chip-embedded Blacks for operations in the field. If the chip is successful at the end of a 2-year research and development period, DHS and Boeing will share the cost of a 6-month pilot program, Sritapan said. State Department staffers apparently plan to or are currently using the Black."Boeing's team will provide a two-consecutive day Discovery Workshop that includes a Boeing Black product overview, technical deep dives and a security requirements analysis," department officials said in a solicitation for a Boeing Black Secure Voice Workshop released Monday. Other players in the military-grade smartphone space include the similarly-named Blackphone made by Silent Circle, an encrypted communications provider co-founded by the inventor of PGP encryption and a former Navy Seal. Android-based Samsung smartphones running the firm’s Knox security software are another option for Pentagon components. Defense Department Chief Information Officer Terry Halvorsen has previously said DOD plans to test top-secret smartphones in the fall. The smartphone AI under development also would continuously track unusual digital transactions, like an app meddling with the operating system or a spike in network traffic, DHS officials said.MIT Technology Review describes the way neuromorphic chips understand the world as basically cognition: "Like the neurons in your own brain, those on HRL’s chip adjust their synaptic connections when exposed to new data. In other words, the chip learns through experience."Their low-power consumption makes the chips especially attractive for smartphones that sap batteries, experts say. Last fall, HRL Laboratories test-piloted a miniature drone with a Defense-funded prototype neuromorphic chip inside. The unmanned aircraft learned to recognize three different rooms it had never entered before by memorizing their wall patterns.A Black-Blackberry Connection?The phone in which the thinking-chip will be tested is straight out of a James Bond movie. The Black completely erases itself if it detects human or technical tampering. It looks like a common, touchscreen Android smartphone, but the hardware and software inside can be custom-tailored to an agency’s or company's specific needs. In the DHS model, the hidden innards will consist of the neuromorphic chip and associated software. Government smartphone stalwart BlackBerry – stepping back from device production – announced last year it will provide software services for Black. BlackBerry this month bought Good Technology, a mobile security software provider widely used in the public sector. Good and BlackBerry combined represented 19 percent of the $1.4 billion mobile management software sector last year. On Tuesday, Boeing officials said in an emailed statement, "Boeing has developed a secure, mobile solution that is designed to meet the needs of defense and security customers. Due to customer sensitivities, we cannot disclose who is currently using the device or considering a purchase."(Image via bestfoto77/ Shutterstock.com)

 Subject: Re: Fw: Augur: Blockchain-based Internet prediction market.
Thanks, jim. I will read your essay and engage with this topic again soon, but I'm immersed in another unrelated story that's consuming my brain and time. I'll get back to you.
I wanted to mention that Prof Juels has responded to my inquiry.      See his work at:        
 I should point out that the main reason for my inquiry WASN'T to get academic credit, but rather to point out that people who have read my AP essay (and who understand and agree with its goals and likelihood of working) would consider Juels et al objectives to be undesirable and, indeed, dangerous.  Superficially, it sounds good to say that they are trying to prevent "criminal contracts", but for those of us who oppose (for example) laws against currently-illegal drugs, we might very well WANT a "criminal contract" to be operational, like Silk Road or such.  Or my AP (assassination politics) idea.
Prof Juels claims that he/they were not aware of my AP essay.  Well, sorry, but I find that a little hard to believe.  It's not that it's hard to believe that an average citizen of America (or the world) hadn't heard of it.THAT would be easy to believe.    Rather, Juels, Shi, and Kosba claim to be working on the concept of trying to stop "criminal contracts", and do you really believe they haven't heard of AP?!?  
My understanding is that my AP essay is probably the second most-famous Internet essay in existence, perhaps being Ted Kaczynski's, and it makes far more sense.  Now that Juels, Shi, and Kosba definitely know about AP, I think that they should address its implications BEFORE they purport to fight it.              Jim Bell From: jim bell  To: Jim Epstein   Sent: Wednesday, August 26, 2015 3:39 PM

 Subject: Augur: Blockchain-based Internet prediction market.
Augur May Become the Greatest Gambling Platform in History. Is There Anything the Government Can Do to Stop It?
A blockchain-based prediction market that won’t be controlled or managed by anyone.
Jim Epstein   Aug. 11, 2015 12:36 pm
An online gambling platform could do to the neighborhood bookie what electric refrigerators did to the ice delivery man.
Coming this fall, Augur will allow participants to wager money on any future event of their choosing. Software will set the odds, collect the bets, and disperse the winnings. The price alone should give Nevada sportsbook operators pause; an estimated one percent of every pot will go to keep the system running. The average vig today is about 10 times that.
Augur isn't a full-fledged casino. You can't play roulette or poker, and running lotto on the platform would be tricky. But it'll be great for sports betting.
Here’s what’s truly novel about Augur: It won’t be controlled by any person or entity, nor will it operate off of any one computer network. All the money in the system will be in Bitcoin, or other types of peer-to-peer cryptocurrency, so no credit card companies or banks need to be involved. If the system runs afoul of regulators—and if it’s successful, it most certainly will—they'll find that there's no company to sue, no computer hardware to pull out of the wall, and no CEO to lockup in a cage.This is new legal territory. If Augur catches on as a tool for betting on everything from basketball games to stock prices, is there anything the government can do to stop it?
Augur is a decentralized peer-to-peer marketplace, a new kind of entity made possible by recent breakthroughs in computer science. The purpose of these platforms is to facilitate the exchange of goods and services among perfect strangers on a platform that nobody administers or controls. Augur’s software will run on what’s known as a “blockchain"—a concept introduced in 2008 with the invention of Bitcoin—that's essentially a shared database for executing trades that's powered and maintained by its users.
Bitcoin’s blockchain was designed as a banking ledger of sorts—kind of like a distributed Microsoft Excel file—but Augur will utilize a groundbreaking new project called Ethereum that expands on this concept. Ethereum allows Augur's entire system to live on the blockchain. That means the software and processing power that makes Augur function will be distributed among hundreds or thousands of computers. Destroying Augur would involve unplugging the computers of everyone in the world participating in the Ethereum blockchain.
If Augur is destined to become the cypherpunks answer to gambling prohibition—the betting man’s version of the online drug market Silk Road if you will—you'd never know it from talking with its developers. They work for a San Francisco-based nonprofit, attend conferences, have legal representation, and talk openly about what they’re up to with reporters. Augur even commissionedone of those cheesy motion graphics promotional videos favored by new tech startups.
About half of the roughly $600,000 raised by Augur's development team comes from Joe Costello, the successful tech entrepreneur who was once Steve Jobs' top pick to become the CEO of Apple.
Joey Krug, a twenty-year-old Pomona college dropout and Augur's lead developer, never uses the world “gambling" to describe his venture. He and his team of five employees call Augur a “prediction market,” a term that emphasizes the information generated when a bunch of people have a financial incentive to feed their expertise into a sophisticated algorithm.
With Augur, as bettors move money in and out of the pot, the odds adjust. This yields publicly available statistics that should carry weight because they're derived from the opinions of a crowd of people with a stake in the results. InTrade, for example, the best-known prediction market until federal regulators forced it to stop serving U.S. customers in 2012, beat the pollsters and pundits by foreseeing the outcome of the 2008 presidential elections in 48 out of 50 states.
Augur’s developers hope that their platform will make it possible to do a Google search to look up the likelihood of some future event. This could usher in a better world, with more informed policy decisions and less malinvestment.
But Augur also serves the less high-minded—though no less noble—purpose of providing cost savings and convenience to gamblers. Restrictions on gambling serve to protect government revenue at the betting man's expense. State-sanctioned casino operators pay high taxes, and state-run lotteries fleece their customers. But there's no logical or moral case for government restrictions on gambling, since no third party is harmed when consenting adults wager money on the future. Augur actually has the potential to make the world safer by taking away market share in the gambling industry from criminals.
And yet sports betting is illegal in most states, and prediction markets are tightly regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CTFC). The agency sued Ireland-based InTrade in 2012 to prevent it from accepting bets from U.S. customers. (The company folded shortly after.) In 2013, the CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) jointly sued the prediction market Banc de Binary for allowing U.S. customers to make bets on commodity prices.
The CFTC has approved other prediction markets, such as the New Zealand-based PredictIt, but only after it agreed to abide by the agency's restrictions.
Krug says the Augur team is planning to meet with CFTC staff go over how their system works before it’s launched, but says he's not overly concerned. “Our friends in Washington, D.C. say the CFTC will probably just dismiss Augur and say it’s not a big deal,” Krug told me in a phone interview.
That doesn’t sound like much of a legal strategy, but how do you have a legal strategy when you're building something unlike anything that's ever existed? Federal anti-gambling laws, such as the 2006 Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act, target the companies that facilitate online betting— website operators, credit card companies, banks—not individual gamblers.
Augur’s biggest legal vulnerability is the community of human “reporters” who are needed to settle bets on the platform, says Cardozo Law School's Aaron Wright, who is writing a book about the legal implications of blockchain technology. Let’s say a group of people wager money on Augur over the outcome of a boxing match. Once the bout is over, human participants (who receive a portion of the trading fees as compensation) must report the outcome to the system before Augur’s software will disperse the money to the winners. "There’s at least an argument that the people doing that reporting are aiding or abetting unlicensed options and could be prosecuted," says Wright.
But Augur doesn't collect personal information on any of its users, so identifying these people could be difficult. And Augur is a borderless technology, so U.S. gamblers could simply rely on foreigners to report on the outcomes of their bets.
One attorney I spoke with suggested that the team that’s building Augur could be brought up on charges for aiding and abetting a criminal conspiracy. Nate Cardozo, a staff attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, thinks that's far-fetched but says he can't rule it out. Cardozo emphasizes that writing open source software doesn’t necessarily protect the team from prosecution.
“We’ve taken the steps that we need to take in order to bracket the individual's risk and the organization’s risk,” says Augur’s attorney, Marco Santori, who declined to comment further on exactly what those steps might entail.
Even if Krug and his colleagues were to face criminal prosecution, the technology would live on. After Augur is born into the world, the development team could release a software update that would cripple the system. But in that case, Augur's users could band together to block any changes to the underlying code, or another developer could copy the open source code and simply re-launch the platform. 
The big question with Augur—and with blockchain platforms more generally—is whether they can outrun our regulatory state long enough to grow so large and popular that they're truly unstoppable. My money’s on Augur in that race.

References: <20150927103913.GA2584
  From: Georgi Guninski I noticed that (at least!) one media report portrayed this as making VW's less "green".  But from another report, I saw that they had 10% greater gas mileage if they were allowed to cheat.  (In other words, less CO2 emissions per mile.)  Now, the above quote refers to "huge amounts" of NOx.  (nitrogen oxides, probably NO and NO2).  The question is, for those people who complain about CO2 being a greenhouse gas, what is the relative undesireability of extra CO2 versus extra NOx.  Relative harm, and all that.  Which is a concept that people who call themselves "environmentalists" seem to have a great deal of difficulty with.
This also raises an idea:  I've never heard of this, but what would be wrong with allowing differences in emissions based on location?  Putting a GPS in a car is trivial today.  Producing less NOx inside a city would make sense; producing less NOx while on a cross-country road-trip less so.                    Jim Bell

  From: Georgi Guninski Generally I do, having a degree in Chemistry.  However, automobile emissions is a sub-specialty to which I have never been exposed, except for reading occasional articles on the subject.  Mostly you don't need to know chemistry to understand the car-pollution situation, however.  CO2 is rather innocuous, except possibly for the issue of being a GHG (greenhouse gas; said to keep in heat to the Earth;  "Global Warming" or "Climate Change".)    NO and NO2 are poisonous, but are present in normal car exhaust in far smaller proportion than CO2.  When automobile engines run, presumably there is a tradeoff:  You can set the operating conditions of the car to "low CO2" (higher gas mileage) but at the same time NOx goes up.  Or, you can lower NOx, but at the price of "high CO2" (lower gas mileage).
As far as I can see, VW recognized that there was/is a tradeoff between the emission of CO2 and NOx.  (Where NOx is used as a shorthand for nitrogen oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2; which when at high concentration dimerizes to N2O4, but this isn't really significant for auto-exhaust issues.)  "THE RULES" said they had to reduce NOx to some value, call it "Y".  But VW recognized that if it did that, gas mileage would go down a lot, perhaps it is 10%.  VW made the choice to cheat, to reduce the emission to "Y" but only when the car recognized that it was undergoing emissions testing.  
Maybe other car manufacturers were aware of it.  But they may have been cheating, too, greatly reducing their motivation to report VW.
That would have been a major clue.  But presumably the testers didn't have any way to know how much diesel fuel was actually being consumed on the road by VW's cars.
Quite possibly.  But I think the trade-off VW chose might actually be worthwhile.  At least when the car is not in a city.               Jim Bell

@_subject: Stingray legal case 
[quote begins]
On Wednesday, the Maryland Court of Special Appealspublished a legal opinion finding that state police must not only obtain a warrant before deploying a cell-site simulator, but are required to also fully explain to the court what exactly the device does and how it is used.
As Ars has long reported, cell-site simulators—known colloquially as stingrays, can be used to determine a mobile phone’s location by spoofing a cell tower. In some cases, stingrays can intercept calls and text messages. Once deployed, the devices intercept data from a target phonealong with information from other phones within the vicinity. At times, police have falsely claimed the use of a confidential informant when they have actually deployed these particularly sweeping and intrusive surveillance tools.
In recent years, stingray use has come under increasing scrutiny, with several states includingCalifornia, Washington, Virginia, Minnesota, and Utah now mandating a warrant be issued for their use. Last year, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice also imposed new policies that require a warrant for stingray use in most cases.
In an e-mail to Ars, American Civil Liberties Union attorney Nathan Wessler called Wednesday's opinion the "first appellate opinion in the country to fully address the question of whether police must disclose their intent to use a cell site simulator to a judge and obtain a probable cause warrant."
"The court’s opinion is a resounding defense of Fourth Amendment rights in the digital age," he continued. "The court’s withering rebuke of secret and warrantless use of invasive cell phone tracking technology shows why it is so important for these kinds of privacy invasions to be subjected to judicial review. Other courts will be able to look to this opinion as they address rampant use of cell site simulators by police departments across the country.
[end of portion quoted]
My opinion:  The purpose of a "warrant" is to make legal what would otherwise be illegal.  If an ordinary citizen used a stingray for this sort of surveillance, that would clearly be called illegal.  Therefore, police should be required to obtain a warrant in order to use a stingray.  (or, more properly, they shouldn't be allowed to do that at all.)

Given that hard-disk capacity probably increases by 50%+ per year, this is not at all surprising.  That huge Utah NSA data center was probably designed in 2000-2001.  At that time, the typical hard drive as sold was probably 2-4 gigabytes.  At that time, it would probably have only been able to store the metadata of all phone calls in the world.  By the time Clapper's lie unearthed the facts, in 2013, the typical hard drive had increased to perhaps 1000x larger, or 2 terabytes.  That would have allowed that data center to store the audio of every phone call in the world for a year, maybe much more.And 10-terabyte hard drives are now being made.            Jim Bell
White House gets tougher on data centers in new policy
The Data Center Optimization Initiative will supersede 2010 Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative, a foundational effort that led to the closure of 1,900 data centers since 2010.
By Billy Mitchell
AUGUST 1, 2016 5:30 PM
The White House finalized a policy Monday that forbids agencies from budgeting funds toward the creation or expansion of data centers, with few exceptions.  
The Office of Management and Budget implemented the Data Center Optimization Initiative, introduced as a draft plan in March, to supersede the 2010 Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative, building on the previous policy's framework for making IT spending more efficient. 
The DCOI requires that agencies wishing to put resources toward the expansion or building of a data center must request approval from federal CIO Tony Scott and include an analysis of alternative options and how doing so would result in a net reduction of the agency's data center inventory. 
As set forth in the prior FDCCI policy, agencies must continue to reduce data center inventory to "essential enterprise levels." The new policy defines data centers as “rooms with at least one server, providing services (whether in a production test, staging, development, or any other environment) but not “rooms containing only print servers, routing equipment, switches, security devices (such as firewalls), or other telecommunications components.”
Based on this definition, agencies must complete a review of their data center inventory by Aug. 31. 
Scott in a blog post touted the "enormous progress" the federal government has made reducing its data center footprint since 2010.
"Agencies have closed over 1,900 data centers, reducing the real estate footprint of Federal data centers by more than 1.2 million square feet, and made significant strides toward optimizing existing data centers," he wrote. "These efforts have resulted in nearly $1 billion in savings and a Federal data center inventory that is more efficient, effective, and secure. "
The new policy cites the Federal IT Acquisition Reform Act as a driving force, holding CIOs accountable for "implementing and measuring progress toward meeting the goals set forth in this memorandum." 
Particularly, the DCOI holds CIOs to meet stringent goals around consolidation and optimization. In the next three years, agencies must close at least 25 percent of their tiered data centers — centers with separate physical space, uninterruptible power supply, dedicated cooling systems and a backup generator — and 60 percent of non-tiered data centers, which are smaller systems, like server rooms and nodes. 
"This target will result in the closure of approximately 52% of the overall Federal data center inventory and a reduction of approximately 31% in the real estate footprint occupied by data centers Government-wide," Scott wrote.
Likewise, the policy calls for agencies to reduce annual data center costs by at least 25 percent by fiscal year 2018, estimating a savings of $2.7 billion if achieved. 
Agencies must also achieve optimization targets in five other areas, according to Scott: "installation of energy metering to track power consumption; a power usage effectiveness (PUE) target to improve energy efficiency; virtualization and server utilization metrics to ensure IT equipment is being utilized efficiently; and a facility utilization metric to drive more efficient use of space in Federal data centers.
To get there, OMB has called on the General Services Administration to provide a marketplace of shared services so that agencies of any size, with any budget can strive for these goals.
GSA will provide a Data Center Infrastructure Management Tool Assessment to help agencies access tools "to monitor, measure, manage and/or control data center utilization and energy consumption of all IT-related equipment," and share other best practices to help agencies comply with the policy.
"The marketplace will ensure an even playing field for customers to learn about and negotiate services with providers," GSA Administrator Denise Turner Roth said in a statement.

@_subject: Three cheers for the NSA! 
PHILADELPHIA – The National Security Agency (NSA) has “all” of Hillary Clinton’s deleted emails and the FBI could gain access to them if they so desired, William Binney, a former highly placed NSA official, declared in a radio interview broadcast on Sunday.
Speaking as an analyst, Binney raised the possibility that the hack of the Democratic National Committee’s server was done not by Russia but by a disgruntled U.S. intelligence worker concerned about Clinton’s compromise of national security secrets via her personal email use.
Binney was an architect of the NSA’s surveillance program. He became a famed whistleblower when he resigned on October 31, 2001, after spending more than 30 years with the agency.
He was speaking on this reporter’s Sunday radio program, “Aaron Klein Investigative Radio,” broadcast on New York’s AM 970 The Answer and Philadelphia’s NewsTalk 990 AM.
Binney referenced testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in March 2011 by then-FBI Director Robert S. Mueller in which Meuller spoke of the FBI’s ability to access various secretive databases “to track down known and suspected terrorists.”
Stated Binney: “Now what he (Mueller) is talking about is going into the NSA database, which is shown of course in the (Edward) Snowden material released, which shows a direct access into the NSA database by the FBI and the CIA. Which there is no oversight of by the way. So that means that NSA and a number of agencies in the U.S. government also have those emails.”

It occurs to me that this may reflect their misunderstanding of the process.   (Misunderstandingby sympathetic employees of the Tor project., or possibly they were misled.)    I have no doubt that Congress would be capable of writing a funding bill for Tor thatis sufficiently specific and detailed to absolutely prohibit any improvements toTor.  However, I strongly doubt that the funding is limited in that way.  
Rather, I suspect that the funding doesn't explicitly state within the grant of funding that cites chaff fill, etc. is covered.  If the Executive branch WANTED to do those projects, theywould simply direct some of their funding to those projects.  Instead, I think the higher-upsmay be deliberately misleading the lower-level people about what they could do,if they decided to do it.
I see that quite recently, Congress has asked them to find out ways to prevent "bad people"from using Tor.  (Probably without defining the term "bad people" sufficiently.   Maybe we are all, automatically, "bad people.")    
Notice that the goal is very poorly defined, so the task is inherently vague and the solution will be similarly vague and imprecise, providing much cover for the entire project.
 Perhaps the solution will be that the Tor project team will study how to insert "anti-bad-people"chaff into the Tor streams, increase the number of hops (more to confuse the "bad people"; they confuse the hell out of me!), etc.  Eventually, they will have to sadly announce that they haven't yet fully succeeded  in preventing"bad people" from using Tor, but they HAVE greatly improved security in various ways.

I wish I knew far more about Tor.  But it seems to me that you are describing one kind of attack, one that would be effective against a site sending/receiving a large number of packets.  Yes, that's significant, but I think if the sender tendedto limit the packets, it would be much harder to correlate in the way you describe.  Maybe others who know more will contribute a comment.I think people would like to guard against the possibility that these transfer siteswere somehow malicious, collecting data for correlations.  Having two transfersites rather than one would make the process less susceptible to that weakness.

PGP 1.0 also worked exactly as designed.  It was limited to keylengths of 1024 bits,as I recall, which no doubt Phil Zimmerman considered sufficient for a first attempt..  Eventually it was considered by others desireable to issue revisions allowing much-longer keylengths.  Does anybody claim that Zimmerman was intent on making ahoney-pot?  
Tor was/is a good start.  But it nevertheless should be improved

In Michael Byrnes’ new dystopian science-fiction thrillerBounty, a string of high profile murders are connected to bounty4justice.com: a website that offers bounties for the assassinations of corrupt politicians, crooked bankers, and other targets seemingly above the law.While bounty4justice.com is fiction, it bears a very strong resemblance to a real-life kill-for-pay website first reported on in 2013. Only accessible through the Dark Web, the Assassination Market offered crowdsourced murder to the masses. The site, the creation of pseudonymous entrepreneur who went by the name Kuwabatake Sanjuro (taken from the Akira Kurosawa film Yojimbo), enabled anonymous users to submit a target for assassination along with a bounty in bitcoin for anyone who could get the job done. Users who might not have a target of their own in mind could contribute to bounties already established.Like bounty4justice.com, the Assassination Market specialized in high-ranking political figures and powerful businessmen: people like President Barack Obama and former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke. In an interview with Forbes’ Andy Greenberg, Sanjuro, a self-described anarchist, said that his purpose in establishing the Assassination Market was to make risky for people to seek public officeSanjuro’s Assassination Market was not the first or only one of its kind. The inspiration for Sanjuro’s site, and many others, can be found in the essays of crypto-anarchist Jim Bell. Bell first outlined a model for crowdfunded political murder in a series of essays published in the mid-nineties. In Bell’s model, a group of activists would select a public figure and place “bets” on possible days he or she might die. With all of the crowdsourced funding up for grabs, all a potential assassin would need to do is murder the public figure and collect the funds. In theory, the other bettors would bear no criminal liability for the murder, as their wager was placed on a possible date of death and not how the person would die. In other words, a dead pool: a tasteless but legal game.[end of portion quoted]

Apparently, that is true.   The tantalizing thing is that SOMETHING APPEARS   (information, of some nature) to be transferred between one particle and another, distant one, and yet there seems to be no way to use that transfer to actually transmit useful FTL (faster than light) information.                 Jim Bell

 From: Steve Kinney I hope people will forgive me for tooting my own horn.  I was a minarchist Libertarian in 1994,not an anarchist Libertarian.  But it wasn't because I somehow wanted to keep around someminimal government.  Rather, it was because I couldn't figure out a logically-consistent method'to entirely get rid of those last vestiges of government.  Lacking such an plausible method,I chose the intellectually-honest route of accepting (at the time) that some residual governmentwould be necessary.
While not specifically aware of David Friedman's (son of famous economist Milton Friedman)"Hard Problem"     , from his book, "The Machinery of Freedom" (1973; revised in 1989; again 2014),  I was effectivelyaware of the  same barrier, and like Friedman, I could not see any solution.  Anarchy, I concluded, was impractical, and unachievable. 
It's a good thing that I wasn't aware of Friedman's "Hard Problem", or the idea it was "hard".In January 1995 I because to contemplate the idea that turned into my "AssassinationPolitics" essay.     
  I wasn't intending to solve that problem:  Rather, I was trying to figure out howan otherwise-powerless public could defend itself from bad acts, mostly from governmentemployees.  I realized that to combine the contributions of anonymous individuals,  allowsthat public can deter and prevent those bad acts.  I further realized that this system wouldbe extremely economical, allowing (for instance) the region known as "America" to defenditself, not merely from external threats, but also internal crime, probably for a total cost of under $1 billion per year, far less than the $600 billion in defense spending currently done.
A simplistic, initial analysis (which I initially assumed, even before I wrote the first part of theAP essay) was that AP would simply fix government.  But the ultimate "fix" was actually farmore powerful than I'd initially realized, not merely fixing governments, but destroying allgovernments, and thus protecting an anarchist or minarchist region from threatening neighbors.
Put simply, I solved David Friedman's "Hard Problem".  I haven't yet seen the 2014 revisionof his book, Machinery of Freedom, to see if he has acknowledged this yet.    I think it wouldbe extraordinarily strange if he doesn't do so:  After all, ostensibly we are on the same sideof this matter.  He advocates a zero-government solution:  Why wouldn't he cite a proofthat a zero-government solution is actually possible, contrary to his apparent previousopinion?
 
But in effect, I think I was quite correct, pre-1995, for me  to believe that anarchy was impractical.   I don't know how people who labelled themselves as 'anarchists'  resolvedthe apparent contradiction.  Were they aware that anarchy wasn't stable?  (At least notabsent my 1995 invention, AP).   Most likely I think they were simply unaware that anarchywasn't going to be stable.  Or, perhaps they assumed that then-future events would somehowsolve the problem.  As, ultimately, they did, but it didn't have to be that way.  I, virtually byaccident, solved that problem.  But things could have been very different.

 >  Which sounds rather absurd no?
Certainly that sounds absurd!   It IS absurd!  Which explains a lot of the fascinationhas for entangled photons and related phenomena.  Einstein never liked the quantum-mechanics idea, famously declaring "God does not play dice with theuniverse".     Unfortunately for Einstein, dice are actually played.
In fact, Einstein's EPR Paradox (Einstein, Podolski, Rosen) was invented byEinstein himself in an attempt to prove that quantum mechanics could notbe a complete statement of the problem.  
This principle said that IF quantum mechanics were a complete statement of the problem, then something seemingly impossible [fill in the blank with FTL information travel] would occur.  Einstein wasquite convinced that nothing (including no information) could travel faster than'c'.  Amazingly, it appears that nature ("God", for the religious among you) has actedsimultaneously to protect the quantum mechanics theory, but ALSO to protect Einstein's belief that nothing could travel faster than 'c'.   If anybody should discovera method to use entangled photons to effectively transmit data FTL (and thus,presumably at infinite speed) that person would surely deserve a Nobel Prize inPhysics.

It's at least 10,000 times 'c' the speed of light in a vacuum, according toexperiments involving fiber optics.  It might be essentially infinite.

Well, that's the problem.  Knowing that SOMETHING is being transmitted, and actuallyUSING that method to transmit useful information, are (quite strangely) two differentthings.  That, also is the amazing implications of entangled photons.

No, you obviously don't understand.  Something can be "absurd" and yetquite real.  "Absurd" merely explains how we react to something we do notunderstand.Simple example of thing that appears "absurd":  To somebody in 6th grademath, the question "what is the square root of negative 1" looks absurd.But it isn't absurd to a 12th grader taking calculus.
At one point, the idea that Earth is flat was the received wisdom, and anallergation that Earth is round was "absurd".  Einstein's theory ofrelativity was "absurd" to people who grew up on Newtonian theory.  The idea that nuclei in atoms would  decay, emitting hugeamounts of energy, was "absurd" in 1900.  By 1946, nuclear bombshad killed well over 100,000 people.

Einstein was wrong, and ultimately other scientists were right.  And theyconfirmed that, with experiments and further theory.
Scientific dispute exists.  It's normal.Curiously, in the 1920's, a Russian scientist named Lysenko believedthat characteristics could be acquired by an organism far more quicklythan genetics would otherwise allow.      Soon enough, he was considered a fraud, a joke.  And he was, but eventually the phenomonof methylation of the DNA strand ('epigenetics') was discovered. 
In 1978, I visited the Smithsonian Institution for the first (and so far last) time.  Oneof the exhibits was a display of "quack" medical equipment, including gas-dischargetubes that were activated with high-voltage and were said to control pain.  Quackmedical treatment.  By 1996, I was working at a company which designed and built TENSunits (Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator) which reduce paid by using small electrical currents.      
What did you say, above?    "So says one faction of the 'scientific' establishment."
Why not?  Have you ever heard the term, "phase velocity"?   
Prior to relatively recently, people generally thought nothing could travelfaster than 'c'.  They thought that travel faster than 'c' was "absurd".  
Yes.  They determined that the 'speed' of whatever was going on had to be at least10,000 times 'c', but they couldn't determine an upper limit to that value.
 >   If you know that 'something' was transmitted, then al least one
 >   bit of information was transmitted, no? 
Like I said, there's a difference between knowing something is happening,and being able to actually employ that for useful purposes.If I see a horse running in the prairie, and yet I cannot capture him, Icannot use him to travel at horse-speed rather than man-speed.
Even in the 1s00s, people knew that light traveled at a finite(non-infinite) velocity.  Hint:  It involved Jupiter's moons.
But until the invention of the Fleming valve (old name for an 'electrontube') and then radio, people didn't know how to transmit information from Europe to America in a few milliseconds. 
Curiously, Thomas Edison really screwed up by not recognizing the value ofthe "Edison Effect" (which he wasn't actually the first to recognize)
 >   Again, either information is being transmitted at FTL speed or
  >  not. So, what is being claimed here?
We simply don't know how to use entangled photons to transmit informationat greater than 'c'.  And there is no guarantee we will ever know how to doso.
And if you believe that something must definitely be one thing, or another, I will have to introduce you to Schrodinger's Cat.
 ...which has the weird property of being able to be alive and dead at the same time.

@_subject: "Bounty" by Michael Byrnes, Kirkus review 
KIRKUS REVIEW
Vigilantism goes viral in this thriller about a website that pays bounties for the killing of unpunished child abusers, financial scammers, human rights violators, and other bad actors.
These are individuals such as Chase Lombardi, a Bernie Madoff–like investment banker, who days after his acquittal gets shot through the eye by a sniper in the name of "social justice" while gazing out the window of his posh Manhattan office. The price on his head, as he was informed in taunting text and email alerts: $530,000. More than 20 other people have been targeted by bounty4justice.com in the United States, Europe, and Asia. But even the savviest techs can't locate the host servers of the site, especially after it starts dealing in untraceable NcryptoCash. As brutal as the killings are—a bigoted white congressman is torched in his car by his Hispanic limo driver for cancelling insurance benefits, resulting in the death of the driver's asthmatic son—the people behind bounty4justice are hailed as "freedom fighters" à la Edward Snowden. Soon enough, the "proof of death" videos required by the site for payment go viral, a reality show–like fever grips the nation, and ordinary citizens are competing with professional assassins for prize money. Byrnes (The Genesis Plague, 2010, etc.) has a solid, if far-fetched, premise to work with, and he knows his way around secure message boards and such. But he spends so much time cataloging the assorted targets and the workings of the site that he risks wearing the reader out. And the book never delivers the kind of dramatic payoff its "cyber spring" promises.
Charles Bronson's Death Watch meets the Internet, with little of the hand-wringing melodrama that might suggest.

I can, but don't call me Shirley.
I thought of an interesting thought-experiment that may clarify the situation.It's new, and doesn't precisely follow quantum, but here goes:
Suppose you have two points in space,  for concreteness 1 light-year apart.There is a Star-trek type transporter, one pad at each location.  But it canonly transport information, not matter.
Place a data file on the first pad, press the button, and it will be virtuallyinstantly sent to the second pad, 1 l.y. away.  But the 'gotcha' is that itwon't arrive in plaintext:  It will be encrypted.  It can still be read as seemingly random, encrypted bits, and there are crc's, checksums,'fire codes', and other verifications that the whole file arrived successfully.
The first (originating) transporter also generates a key, which can be usedto decrypt the file.  Problem is, it can only be sent by laser, and thus at 'c'.Send the file, and it appears virtually instantly at the far end.  But its actualunencrypted contents cannot be read in plaintext.  The data packet mustbe placed on the shelf, and after one year the photon-beam containing thedecrypt code packet arrives.   (Possibly with the addition of a copy of the original message, for additional certainty that they got the original message.).
They apply the decrypt key to the packet which arrived one year before.The decrypt works, and they discover that the message is identical to theone sent by laser one year previous, and was just received a moment before.
Wouldn't it be possible to argue that the data MUST have travelled at 10,000+'c'?  If it hadn't, how could the values of data on the printout have been determined'instantly'?
Question:  At what rate did that "instantaneous" data transfer occur?  Well,it sure looks like it was indeed "instantaneous".  The original packet arrived,it was placed on the shelf in seconds.  But, the information within it wasn'tactually readable for one year, until the decrypt key arrived.  Can we say thatthis information arrived after one year, and thus at an effective speed of 'c'?  If it is the former, somehow the idea that information can't be transmitted at fasterthan 'c' is invalid.  If it's the latter, this appears to confirm that limit.
Which is it?
You said:  "Yep. It either works or not."
The 'gotcha' is that whether it "works" or not is dependent on your definition of the word, 'works'.  Does it seem to transmit the data virtually instantly?  Yes.  Is that information available immediately?  No. It takes a year to learn the contentof that encrypted file.
Is the limit of 'c' violated?   I don't know.  What do you think?

 From: Georgi Guninski Yes, this is what I was alluding to when I used the term, "phase velocity".    Although, it isn't really clear from this articlethat the phase can travel far faster than 'c', nevertheless the information the wave transmits is limited to its "group velocity", which cannot travel faster than 'c'.  The moon's diameter is about 2169 miles.  If you aimed a laser beam to one edgeof the moon, and then quickly (0.01 second) moved the beam to the other edge,the spot would look like it's travelling at 216,900 miles per second, well beyond 'c'.(ignoring the fact that the moon is a spheroid, not a flat surface, of course.)
There is no actual communication from those two points on opposite sides of the moon,nor are massive particles moving from one point to the other.
I learned my physics from course 8.03 at MIT, with the coursebook by Bekefi andBarrett, titled "Electromagnetic Waves and Vibrations". 
Unfortunately, that was the last advanced physics course I took, having to focus on my major, chemistry.     The next Physics course, that I didn't take, was 8.04, "Quantum
Physics".      Not that I didn't learn quantum at all, but I learned it from the direction of chemistry.That class was 5.61, and 5.62,  Physical Chemistry.

 From: Zenaan Harkness I will explain what I think they are doing in the fiber-optic version of the experiment,at least so nobody is permanently misled by my previous analogy.
Imagine a central location on earth, let's call it Location B.  20,500 meters west of that is Location A, and 20,500 meters to the east of "B" is Location C.  There's anoptical fiber going from "A" to "B", and another optical fiber going from "B" to "C".Two entangled photons are produced at Location B, then one is launched into fiber going to "A", and the other photon is launched from "B" into the fiber going to "C".
After about 100 microseconds later (since the speed of light in that fiber is about 'c'/1.4584, where 1.4584 is the index of refraction of infrared in silica, thus 205.5 meters /microsecond), those photons emerge from their respective ends.  Notnecessarily at the same time, because the length of the fibers may not be quiteidentical.  They do the detection at Location A, and through prior arrangement theyschedule the detection at "C" a few nanoseconds later, possibly adjusting the physical length of the fiber to get the timing close to being correct..  Good synchronization could be achieved by GPS-controlled clocks, or perhaps a third fiber being used to synchronize local clocks at "A" and "C".
They first detect at "A", and then detect at "C".  And they might reverse the order, forcompleteness.  But that's not the end:To determine that there has been more than a 50% correlation of the measured spins, they haveto transmit the type (angle) of measurement they make by ordinary optical fiber.  (Although,it wouldn't have to be on an optical fiber:  It could be a USB memory stick glued to theshell of a fast snail, I suppose.  the important thing is that the information eventually getsto the other side, not how fast it takes to get there.)

That figure I found from an article a few years ago, that said it would have to travel at least 10,000x that of 'c' to affect the measurement, would require that the delay is measured by:137.136 microseconds/10,000 = 13.7126 nanoseconds.   If the measurement at "A" occurred only 13.7136 nanoseconds before the measurement at "C", and yet there wasstill correlation, this shows that a velocity of at least 10,000 'c' to affect the outcome at "C".
Therefore, I conclude that it would be easy to measure the minimum effective speed of the 
hypothetical interfering particle or wave.  That particle or wave would have to travel 41,000meters in less than 13.7 nanoseconds, to achieve that interference.  Time measurement to 1 nanosecond is easy, to 1 picosecond is doable, and in fact measurement of time valuesfar less than 1 picosecond can be accomplished.

Quantum "spooky action at a distance" travels at least 10,000 times faster than light
Brian Dodson  March 10, 2013  The speed of entanglement dynamics is at least 10,000 times faster than light according to Prof. Juan Yin and colleaguesQuantum entanglement, one of the odder aspects of quantum theory, links the properties of particles even when they are separated by large distances. When a property of one of a pair of entangled particles is measured, the other "immediately" settles down into a state compatible with that measurement. So how fast is "immediately"? According to research by Prof. Juan Yin and colleagues at the University of Science and Technology of China in Shanghai, the lower limit to the speed associated with entanglement dynamics – or "spooky action at a distance" – is at least 10,000 times faster than light.Despite playing a vital role in the development of quantum theory, Einstein felt philosophically at odds with its description of how the universe works. His famous quote that "God does not play dice" hints at his level of discomfort with the role of probability in quantum theory. He believed there exists another level of reality in which all of physics would be deterministic, and that quantum mechanics would turn out to be a description that emerges from the workings of that level – rather like a traffic jam emerges from the independent motions of a large number of cars.[...]
Prof Yin's experiment, which was a bit more complicated in detail than the above simplification, observed no difference in polarization direction. The time it would take light to travel between Alice and Bob was about 50 μs, while the action of the entanglement dynamics had to be less than 0.35 ns. The minimum speed of the entanglement influence is just the one divided by the other, or 144,500 times the speed of light. However, a number of factors go into the interpretation of the results, which reduce the lower limit of the speed of entanglement influence to about 10,000 times the speed of light.
Notice that this result does not eliminate the possibility that the influence of entanglement actually is instantaneous – it merely sets a limit saying how close the influence must be to infinitely fast. Another possibility that is gaining credence is that entanglement dynamics may operate external to time, or at least may ignore time as it ignores distance.

 From: Zenaan Harkness I find it hard to NOT come to the conclusion that information is, in fact,being transmitted.  The problem is that it appears that nature isconspiring with itself to prevent us from using this communication for usefulpurposes.  
But we can certainly hope that someday, some scientist discovers how to break the barrier that would prevent that.  But even once that barrier is broken,engineering difficulties would still exist.  I can imagine that even though FTLcommunication would then be possible, it could not be set up instantaneouslybetween us, on Earth, and (say) Alpha Centauri    (AC)
   
My first thought was that a space vehicle could be sent to a location midwaybetween us and AC.  Once there, it would generate data streams based on entangledphotons, aimed at us and AC.  Those photons, once emitted, would take 2.1 yearsto arrive at here and AC.  At that point, we can detect those photons, and those onAC could do so as well, at FTL speed.  (Again, assuming that somebody eliminates the barrier to FTL communications we currently see.)
But there's a faster way.  If one of the pairs of entangled photons were kept, in "coldstorage" as it were, the other of the pair could be immediately fired towards AC, andAC could do the same.  After 4.2 years, our photon streams could arrive there, andtheir photon streams could arrive here.  At that point, FTL transmission could begin.
A few years ago, we heard of an experiment lowering the speed of photons to a bid
over 30 mph.  ('c' is 186,282 mph, or 299,000 km/sec).   Later experiments dropped thatvalue to virtually zero.  
Suppose the speed of photons were dropped to 1 millimeter per second,in 4.2 years they would have moved 132,500 meters.  
Keep those photons stored, and when the Alpha Centaurians detect the other of the pair of entangled photons, that fact could potentially be detected here as well.
But, I just found this:

 From: Georgi Guninski Presumably, yes, the matter between the two would be irrelevant., I think.
That would be a fascinating experiment!  It would be a way to probe thenature of a black hole.  Generate a stream of entangled photons, throw one pair of each into a black hole, and at a varying delay, and see whatthe detection shows.  One problem might be that the photon thrown intothe black hole can never be 'detected', at least by conventional means.Would there be a detectable result?  Or just random?
"Destroying" them would be akin to "detecting" them, I suspect, although without actually taking measurements of the results.

OK, so they've shown that reality  (for lack of a better word)
Amusingly, one problem is that not only that we (the disputants) might notbe able to agree on "reality", we may not ourselves be individually ableto decide what "reality" is!!
For a number of years, we've been hearing about the "holographic principle",the idea what we think of as 3D+time space is actually merely that defined bya 2D representation on a surface.    
If I got headaches, this kind of think would definitely give me a headache.

 Last time I listened to it, a few years ago, I noticed that the lyrics which amounted to predictions were occurring at a rate perhaps 100x faster than the lyrics defined them as happening.

References:  From: grarpamp Non-British people might not know that for 50+ years, individuals owning televisions have been required to pay a tax.
"In the United Kingdom and the Crown Dependencies, any household watching or recording live television transmissions as they are being broadcast (terrestrial, satellite, cable, or internet) is required to hold atelevision licence. Businesses, hospitals, schools and a range of other organisations are also required to hold television licences to watch and record live TV broadcasts.[1] Since 1 April 2010 the annual licence fee has been £145.50 for colour and £49.00 for black and white.[2][3][4] Income from the licence is primarily used to fund the television, radio and online services of the BBC. The total income from licence fees was £3.735 billion in 2014–15[5] of which £613.4 million or 16.4% was provided by the Government through concessions for those over the age of 75. Thus, the licence fee made up the bulk of the BBC's total income of £4.805 billion in 2014–2015."

@_subject: Media's Lack of Knowledge of Law should be Embarrassing 
Today, there was yet another manufactured scandal involving the media.  Apparently Trump
made a comment about Hillary Clinton and the NRA, which the mainstream media is portraying
as some sort of a threat against her.  No doubt that media is unaware of the Supreme Court
case Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969),       According
to Wikipedia, this decision held that "The Court held that government cannot punish inflammatory
 speech unless that speech is directed to inciting, and is likely to incite, imminent lawless action.
 Specifically, it struck down Ohio's criminal syndicalism statute, because that statute broadly
 prohibited the mere advocacy of violence." 
This decision has never been overturned, although there are probably many subsequent cases, mostlydistrict court and appeals court, which cite it.  This decision is important to me especially:  I wrotemy Assassination Politics essay, and because of Brandenburg I am supposed to be Constitutionallyprotected even if I advocate violent crime, unless it will involve "imminent lawless action", such asa riot.
I think the mainstream media (MSM) should be flailed (figuratively speaking, of course!) for"interpreting" Trump's statement, choosing the interpretation they conclude will be considered most outrageous, and then pushing that as if it is somehow accurate and relevant. Do they ever do thatfor his main opponent, Hillary Clinton?  Not very often, if at all.
Another thing that should be done is to criticizing the news media for implicitly valuing HillaryClinton's life higher than that of other people.  While it may seem odd to value a life, courts do thisfrequently, often in the context of a civil lawsuit based on a wrongful death.  For example, ifa life is 'worth" $100,000 per year and actuaries can state how much longer than life would last, say 30years, if that person wrongfully dies, the damage is 30 x $100,000, or $3 million.
If, when elected, Hillary Clinton will waste, say, $500 billion per year, that amounts to theequivalent of:   $500 billion/$3 million, or 167,000 lives per year.  The kind of people who would criticizeDonald Trump's "NRA" statement involving Hillary would presumably claim that all human life isequal in value:  If they really believe that, they should realize that they must not value Hillary's lifeover that of a typical citizen.  How does the value of 1 life compare with 167,000 lives, the latter in each year over four years?  (No doubt that others will believe that Trump will also waste money; however, the numerous examples of new spending Hillary has proposed would have to result in huge tax increases, or at least enormous deficit spending, which is merely delayed taxation, or inflation.)
I believe that the public should be able to protect themselves against corrupt and incompetentpoliticians.  Naturally, those politicians won't agree.

And even if anonymous, it would be a good guess that the leaker was an insider.The sudden and suspicious death of an insider would at least seem to point to a possible identity.  Julian Assange knows that there will be much speculation;Wikileaks has a powerful motivation to keep the leaks coming, and it knows that people will be paying attention to how it deals with such possibilities.  It mighteven be suspected that to fail to offer such a reward, implies that Wikileaks didn't care about (possible) leakers.  What should he do?  If it were me,I'd offer such a reward, even if I knew for certain the victim wasn't the leaker.
Offering such a reward even where they know it isn't the leaker would also havethe side-benefit of diverting attention from the actual leaker, whoever he mighthappen to be.            Jim Bell

@_subject: Someone leaked Microsoft Keys 
[partial quote]
"Microsoft accidentally leaked the golden keys to the Windows kingdom. The keys allow hackers to unlock every Windows device, including tablets, phones and other devices that are protected by Secure Boot. The most alarming part about the leak is that it is believed that it may likely be impossible for Microsoft to fully recover from the leak."
"The leakwas uncovered by two security researchers MY123 and Slipstream, who revealed in a (Star Wars-style) blog that the security flaw allowed malicious entities with admin rights or physical access to a device can bypass Secure Boot to not only run other operating systems (OS) like Linux or Android on the device but also install and execute rootkits and bootkits, at the most deeply penetrated level of the device."
 "A backdoor, which MS put in to secure boot because they decided to not let the user turn it off in certain devices, allows for secure boot to be disabled everywhere! You can see the irony. Also the irony in that MS themselves provided us several nice 'golden keys' (as the FBI would say) for us to use for that purpose."The leak serves as a reminder of the potential dangers in security when tech firms are pressured by governments and law enforcement agencies into producing special keys that can be used by investigators to unlock devices, in the course of criminal investigations."
"About the FBI: are you reading this? If you are, then this is a perfect real world example about why your idea of backdooring cryptosystems with a 'secure golden key' is very bad!," the duo added."

 Subject: Re: Assange outs the DNC e-mail "leaker"
 From: Steve Kinney I'm skeptical of this conclusion.  Obviously, Wikileaks has the provision to allow people to leak information anonymously.  That doesn't mean that any givenleaker was anonymous to them, but it's still a possibility.   
And even if anonymous, it would be a good guess that the leaker was an insider.The sudden and suspicious death of an insider would at least seem to point to a possible identity.  Julian Assange knows that there will be much speculation;Wikileaks has a powerful motivation to keep the leaks coming, and it knows that people will be paying attention to how it deals with such possibilities.  It mighteven be suspected that to fail to offer such a reward, implies that Wikileaks didn't care about (possible) leakers.  What should he do?  If it were me,I'd offer such a reward, even if I knew for certain the victim wasn't the leaker.
Offering such a reward even where they know it isn't the leaker would also havethe side-benefit of diverting attention from the actual leaker, whoever he mighthappen to be.            Jim Bell
Yes!   An excellent suggestion.

@_subject: Data transferred over air gap. 
"Researchers have devised a new way to siphon data out of an infected computer even when it has been physically disconnected from the Internet to prevent the leakage of sensitive information it stores.
The method has been dubbed "DiskFiltration" by its creators because it uses acoustic signals emitted from the hard drive of the air-gapped computer being targeted. It works by manipulating the movements of the hard drive's actuator, which is the mechanical arm that accesses specific parts of disk platter so heads attached to the actuator can read or write data. By using so-called seek operations that move the actuator in very specific ways, it can generate sounds that transfer passwords, cryptographic keys, and other sensitive data stored on the computer to a nearby microphone. The technique has a range of six feet and a speed of 180 bits per minute, fast enough to steal a 4096-bit key in about 25 minutes.
"An air-gap isolation is considered to be a hermetic security measure which can prevent data leakage," Mordechai Guri, a security researcher and the head of research and development in the cyber security labs at Israel's Ben-Gurion University, told Ars. "Confidential data, personal information, financial records and other type of sensitive information is stored within isolated networks. We show that despite the degree of isolation, the data can be exfiltrated (for example, to a nearby smart phone)."
Besides working against air-gapped computers, the covert channel can also be used to steal data from Internet-connected machines whose network traffic is intensively monitored by intrusion prevention devices, data loss prevention systems, and similar security measures. The technique is documented in a technical paper titled DiskFiltration: Data Exfiltration from Speakerless Air-Gapped Computers via Covert Hard Drive Noise, which was published Thursday night. Guri and the other Ben-Gurion University researchers who devised the covert channel created the video demonstration below."

@_subject: Western Digital self-encrypting drives have security flaws. 
"Several versions of self-encrypting hard drives from Western Digital are riddled with so many security flaws that attackers with physical access can retrieve the data with little effort, and in some cases, without even knowing the decryption password, a team of academics said.
The paper, titled got HW crypto? On the (in)security of a Self-Encrypting Drive series, recited a litany of weaknesses in the multiple versions of the My Passport and My Book brands of external hard drives. The flaws make it possible for people who steal a vulnerable drive to decrypt its contents, even when they're locked down with a long, randomly generated password. The devices are designed to self-encrypt all stored data, a feature that saves users the time and expense of using full-disk encryption software.
"After researching the inner workings of some of the numerous models in the My Passport external hard drive series, several serious security vulnerabilities have been discovered, affecting both authentication and confidentiality of user data," the researchers wrote. "We developed several different attacks to recover user data from these password protected and fully encrypted external hard disks."
Most of the disks studied encrypt and decrypt data using a USB bridge that connects a computer to the external drive's SATA interface. The interface is supposed to be off limits until after the computer user has entered the correct password, and to prevent cracking attacks that try billions of password guesses each second, the plain-text passcode is cryptographically salted and subjected to 1,000 iterations of the SHA256 hash function.
But a constellation of errors makes it possible to crack the password in a short amount of time. In one case, the underlying key was predictable because the random numbers used to generate it was derived from the current time on the computer clock. That flaw was fixed last year, but it's likely many people with vulnerable drives have no idea they're at risk. In other cases, it was possible to extract the hash off the drive and load it onto a computer so it could be subjected to off-line cracking."

"A vital function of the financial system is to shift risk, but that is mostly a euphemism. Finance can't make risks go away, or even really move them all that much. When the financial system shifts the risk of X happening from Y to Z, all that means is that Z gives Y money if X happens. If X was going to happen to Y, it's still going to happen to Y. But now Y gets money. Death is a central fact of human existence, the fundamental datum that gives meaning to life, but it is also a risk -- you never know when it will happen! -- and so the financial industry has figured out ways to shift it. Not in any supernatural sense, I mean, but in the regular financial-industry sense: by giving people money when death happens to them. One cannot know for certain how much of a consolation that is.""Another vital function of the financial system is to brutally punish the mispricing of risk through arbitrage. Actually I don't really know how vital that one is, but people are pretty into it. If someone under- or overestimates a risk, someone else will find a way to make them pay for it. That's how markets, even the market for death, stay efficient.""The normal way to shift the risk of death is life insurance -- you die, the insurance company gives you money -- but there are other, more esoteric versions, and they are more susceptible to arbitrage.One version involves "medium and long-term bonds and certificates of deposit ('CDs') that contain 'survivor options' or 'death puts.'" Schematically, the idea is that a financial institution issues a bond that pays back $100 when it matures in 2040 or whatever. But if the buyer of the bond dies, he gets his $100 back immediately, instead of having to wait until 2040. He's still dead, though."[end of partial quote]
AP ('Assassination Politics';    )  can be considered to be 'death arbitrage' with a few key differences:  The person who will die isn't part of the agreement, and doesn't profit when the initial deal is struck, nor later.                  Jim Bell

 From: John Newman I don't see how there can be "scientific consensus" unless there are accurate computer models which show how up climate temperature increases as a product of addition of CO2 to the atmosphere.  Both qualitatively and quantitatively.  How much do these problems represent?
“When you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers, you know something about it, when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meager and unsatisfactory kind; it may be the beginning of knowledge, but you have scarely, in your thoughts advanced to the stage of science.”
There is also the prospect of adding SO2 to the high atmosphere to counteract heating, which could be a very cheap solution.

[from that article]
"The rampage allegedly started over an undetermined family dispute. Public records show that Zawahri's parents were married in 1985 and moved into the house they purchased on Yorkshire Avenue in 1996, but the mother, Randa Abdou,[35] left the home and moved to an apartment with the two boys in 1998. She sought a restraining order against the father a short time later, but the case was dismissed when the mother failed to appear in court. Subsequently, the elder son lived with the father at the residence on Yorkshire Avenue, while Zawahri lived in an apartment in Mar Vista, Los Angeles with his mother. Though there is no record that the couple divorced, by 2013 they had been living separately for years.[32] Randa Abdou was out of the country visiting relatives at the time of the shooting, but returned during the following weekend and was assisting authorities in the investigation.[11][35]Zawahri prepared a three-page handwritten note that was found on his body. In it, he expressed remorse for killing his father and brother, but did not give a motive. He said goodbye to friends and expressed hope that his mother would be taken care of and receive recompense from his father's estate. Investigators believe that mental illness played a role in the killings, but no details were given. Searching his home, police found replica weapons and illegal zip guns. It was also learned that the California Department of Justice advised Zawahri in an October 2011 letter that he was ineligible to purchase a firearm.[38] The incident occurred the day before Zawahri's 24th birthday."

At the risk of blowing my own horn (which I haven't been doing very much, recently),almost exactly 21 years ago I began writing my essay, "Assassination Politics". I only described the solution to the problem of government in generalterms, there was much more than enough detail to convince many people that I was on the right track.  Consider that the US government collects over 3 trillion dollars per year in taxes.Further, recognize that anybody who is forced to pay those taxes would be wantingto reduce or eliminate that cost, and especially if that money was used to fund misconduct.  If every taxpayer was willing to pay 1% of the tax he pays to stop it, that's1% of 3 trillion, or $30 billion.  If an average death would cost $100,000 with a functioning AP system, that could finance about 300,000 deaths.  Does anybody seriously believe that it would take that many deaths to bring the government toheel?  And particularly if those deaths start mostly at the top levels of the government,rather than the bottom.  And that's only for the first year.Yes, a lot of work still needs to be done.  But consider that it is at least as important to society to eliminate governments as it is to implement a new form of digital cash,i.e. Bitcoin.  Governments killed perhaps 250 million people in the 20th century. Somebody put a lot of work into Bitcoin, and it is working today, as we speak.Similarly TOR, which despite being initially financed by the US government,points the way to better anonymity on the Internet.  Ethereum and Augur are especiallyinteresting, a distributed system of computation that (if it is to be believed) will implement a blockchain system which simply cannot be stop by any realistic methods.  Auguris to be a market for predictions:  What predictions will it be allowed to handle?  Who willdecide?  Nick Szabo said, " A sufficiently large market predicting an individual's death is also, necessarily, an assassination market, and similarly other "prediction" markets are alsoact markets, changing incentives to act outside that market to bring about the predicted events.   If the original quotation, above, is directed at ordinary folks, I can see why Assange might say, "There seems no way to pull the pin on this evil entity called theUnited States government..."    But anybody who has read the AP essayknows that there will be, in fact, a way to do that.  And it should be quite clear that there is much more reason for this today, in 2016,  than there ever was in 1995, when I began writing the AP essay.              Jim Bell

 From: Rayzer The portion of concrete which binds it together, called "cement", is calcium hydroxide, or Ca (OH)2.   Mixed with gravel and sand and water, this makes a slurry called "concrete".  It quickly (hours) cures (hardens), and it begins to absorb CO2.  That conversion makes old concrete harder and stronger than newly-poured concrete.Poured concrete continues to absorb CO2 for months, years, and even decades after it is poured.  However, to make the initial cement, calcium hydroxide,  a chemical called Calcium Carbonate (CaCO3) (limestone is nearly all CaCO3) is heated strongly, and it emits CO2, forming calcium oxide, CaO.  Adding a bit of water forms calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2.
So, the CO2 that curing concrete absorbs is matched by the CO2 that the CaCO3 originally released during the making of the calcium hydroxide.  Further, heating that process requires some sort of fuel, which itself usually releases CO2 as well.

Quote:"Facebook Messenger wants to be your primary messaging app. As people become more and more concerned about security, being the best messaging app means being the most secure. That’s why Facebook is finally adding an option for users to encrypt their chats in Messenger.Messenger will begin to offer an end-to-end encryption feature to a limited test group of users today. It’s a security option that’s been a long time coming for Facebook, which has considered making end-to-end encryption available for several months. The so-called “secret conversations” debuted today will be only visible to the sender and the reader, which means Facebook can’t enable some of the chatbot and payment features that are normally a part of the Messenger experience. However, end-to-end encryption boxes out law enforcement and even Facebook itself from reading users’ chats, ensuring that their conversations remain private.Messenger has also taken steps to make sure that chats remain secure, even if a user’s device gets lost or stolen. In secret conversations, Messenger will allow users to set an expiration date for a message so that it won’t be visible in the conversation forever. Once the time runs out, the message will vanish from the devices of all users in the conversation. Facebook released technical details about its implementation of secret conversations in a white paper (PDF).Secret conversation mode will only be available on iOS and Android, not in Messenger.com, Facebook chat, or the desktop Messenger app — at least for now. Facebook’s vice president of messaging products David Marcus told TechCrunch that the addition of end-to-end encryption is intended to help Messenger become everyone’s go-to app."[end of portion quoted]                     Jim Bell

 From: Steve Kinney >> Also, anarchy seems to work best when everyone is more-or-less
"A couple of years ago, Forbes reported that 400 billionaires owned 1/2
the capital assets in the U.S."
First, I should point out that to the extent that this may seem to be a problem,part of the problem is that behind the scenes, governments actuallymay be _promoting_ income inequality, rather than reducing it.  I'veseen an article that indicates that considered over the entire world economy,income inequality may have peaked in the 1980's, and has been loweringsince then.  To a great degree, that is because of world trade, and the fact that we (America) are getting manufactured goods from foreign countries, to anextent far different than in the, say, 1960's.   This strongly contrasts with thekind of people (leftists) who selectively point to income inequality within a singlenation, saying it is increasing.
"In the face of this, I think AP may have a problem with scale:  How
many small investors does it take to redirect AP profiteers away from
targets chosen by factions among the ruling class, beginning with
anyone suspected of operating the AP infrastructure and/or promoting
it effectively to a wide audience of participants?"
It's hard to target people when you don't know who they are.  In today's political world, people try to make changes by being loud and complaining.Potentially, this makes them targets while AP is turning on.  But I believe thatin a smoothly-functioning 'post-AP-transition' world, people simply don't needto complain.Or, they will be able to do so anonymously.  Would a very rich person havesort of special advantage in an AP world?  Well, he'd have a lot of money, but that would be just about the only advantage he has.  AP would effectively shut down governments, not merely shutting down the need for government, but also making it virtually impossible to run a large,or oppressive (or both) government.  This means that governments won't be able to funnel money to those people who (in today's world) eventually becomebillionaires.
targeted regardless of occupation or etc., how long until ones that do
allow any human to be bet on appear, with inflated bounties on
perceived enemies of the ruling class?"
Long ago, I realized that a fully-functioning, 'complete' AP system would eventually haveto somehow replace both the existing national defense system, as well as theexisting 'criminal justice' system. "Did somebody actually aggress on somebody else?" But initially, to get there, I think it would be sufficient to have an AP-organization with a much-simpler standard:  "Does the person named as the aggressor work for government atsome level?".    He's already aggressed.  No more proof is necessary.
If, hypothetically, I was running such an AP system, I knew that I couldn't stop anyone else fromalso running a different AP system, different rules.  I imagined that this wouldn't (couldn't) be a monopoly, it would amount to a competition.  Some organizations (I'll label them "unethical") would accept bets on anyone.  Others, such as my own, would initially just have the initial"does he work for government" standard.  Over time, I believe that the "ethical" organizationswould have advantages, so they could do the equivalent of offering lower prices:The amount of their awards could be lower.  The "unethical" organizations would "do" anybody, but it would cost much more.  They would take higher profits, meaning that peoplewho had a genuine beef with someone else would tend to employ "ethical" systems.  "Business"would tend to shift.  Over time, the market will shift from "unethical" to "ethical". 
 Eventually, what amounted to "court systems" would be included, to decide whethera complaint was valid.  These "court systems" would, of course, be "voluntary",in the sense nobody would be required to appear, but the consequence of failure to appearwould be that 'bare AP' would operate:  If enough donations appeared to motivate somebody,that would happen.  
At the time I started writing the first part of AP in January-February 1995, I was entirely unaware  of the existence of the CP list, or documents such as Cyphernomicon:I had no direct access to the Internet, and the WWW.  In section 16.4.2 of Cyphernomicon  is the paragraph:  
"The State will of course try to slow or halt the spread of this technology, citingnational security concerns, use of the technology by drug dealers and tax evaders, andfears of societal disintegration. Many of these concerns will be valid; crypto anarchywill allow national secrets to be trade freely and will allow illicit and stolen materialsto be traded. An anonymous computerized market will even make possible abhorrentmarkets for assassinations and extortion."
Despite my forming the idea essentially independently, even then I was not under any impression that I  was somehow inventing the concept of an  "assassination market", which I assumed at the time to be obvious. 
 Rather, I believed that  what  would usually be thought of such a market would be a system where "Anonymous Person A could hire Anonymous Person B to kill Person C."  Certainly that was a sufficiently  fascinating idea in the early 1990's to be worth discussing, but it occurred to me that if that was the only use made of it, few people want specific other peopledead enough to completely finance it themselves.  Far more interesting, the thing I really broughtto the table, would be the idea where tens, hundreds, thousands, or even millions of anonymous persons pool their donations, and offer to any number of potential assassins, such that the winning assassin gets his reward also anonymously.   THAT, I thought and still think, was a new concept.  That is not merely quantitatively different than 'your father's assassination market', but in fact qualitatively different:  Combine enough donations, no matter how tiny the individual ones are, and that will be plenty to buy death.  Further, offer those donations to an unlimited number of people, and the target will have no idea from where the killing blow will strike.  Each potential assassin knows he competing with all the rest.
And once I thought of that idea, I've always believed that it was absolutely inevitable.  SOMEBODY
was going to think of this, eventually.  It just happened to be me.

I'd answer this somewhat differently.  The rocket jet would indeed dislodge the dust:  The particleswould acquire velocities, and would follow mostly-parabolic paths and eventually collide with and stayon the surface again. While this might be labelled a "cloud", unlike in Earth's atmosphere these particles will presumably return to the Moon's surface in a few seconds, yet far away from the lunar lander. As to "why was thick dust still on the ground", most likely the dust was very thick.  (many meters).From:   
"The lunar surface is covered by a layer ofunconsolidated debris called the lunar regolith (fig. 53).The thickness of the regolith varies from about 5 m onmare surfaces to about 10 m on highland surfaces. Thebulk of the regolith is a fine gray soil with a density ofabout 1.5 g/cm3, but the regolith also includes brecciaand rock fragments from the local bedrock (reviewsby Heiken et al. 1974 and Papike et al. 1982). Abouthalf the weight of a lunar soil is less than 60 to 80 micronsin size. The grain size distribution is given in figure 55."
There may be an additional factor.  As I vaguely recall, there is an odd electrostatic attraction between the particles of lunar soil.  Perhaps not surprising, because except for subsurfacefrozen-water deposits (and some polar craters) the moon is 'dry as a bone'.

 From: Steve Kinney Reduce the tax rate of "billionaires", and they will be much less motivated toget involved with government.  And while that happens, states will not have the powerto benefit the people who BECOME billionaires, assisted by such government power.
For some reason I can't seem to "operate" the graph.  The picture zooms, but allI see is a straight red line going from the left side of the box to the right side.  Maybe there is intended to be a curve, but it doesn't appear that way to me.
One of the reasons there are terms, "lying with statistics", is that people cancarefully select the facts they choose to present, and exclude other relevant facts.
I would like to see, on these graphs, a representation of the size of government atthe times involved:  Put simply, I think of government as much more the CAUSE of these problems, rather than the solution.  
Another problem is that this data represents periods with a dramatic difference in America'sindustrial power:  From 1945-1970+, America was a manufacturer to the world:  Europe had been bombed out, and nations such as Europe, Japan, Taiwan, Korea, Mexico, China, and India weren't competeing with America.  That effect was so extreme that in the 50's and 60's,many or most families got away with only one breadwinner, usually the husband.  How muchdoes this change, to today, affect the numbers presented?
That seems to assume that merely by spending money that outcome canbe avoided.  Can it?  If people are very dissatisfied, and they can by spending$10 dollars per person, help shut down a hegemonic system, how can thisbe resisted successfully?
So far, it's taken over 21 years.  I am not disappointed, however.Pay attention to Ethereum and Augur.
I don't think nearly anybody anticipated the rapid fall of the "Iron Curtain" in 1989.  Yet it happened. Very quickly.
I have my doubts.  The cost of overcoming the defences of a President
would be astronomically higher than the costs and risks of overcoming
the defences of, for instance, an independent journalist.  This would
mandate a much higher bounty on the former.
It's the old, "Just put a big enough defense on the top guy, and nobodycan get to him" objection to AP.
That's one reason why AP isn't limited, even in theory, to merely thetop-level people.  What about second, third, fourth, and fifth level people?Their families?  Their friends?  It wouldn't take much to keep virtuallyanybody from wanting to work for a government.  They would probablyhave to pay an increasingly large amount to accept the risk, money that it would be increasingly hard for government to collect.
The analysis for America is simple:  The Feds collect $3 trillion in taxes peryear.  Suppose each person who pays $1 in tax also pays 1 cent for a fundto get rid of his oppressors, or $30 billion.   If a hit cost $100,000 (probably that estimate is very high), if you divide $30 billion by $100,000, that wouldpay for 300,000 hits.  Do you think that the government could function effectively if even as few as 30,000 get killed over a 1-year period?Let alone 300,000?
Currently, "journalists" are seen as having very disproportionate power.  Butwe've already seen that the situation is dramatically changed from the pre-Internet period (which I arbitrarily label as pre-1995, based on its accessibilityand influence.).   With blogs, just abouteveryone is a "journalist" today.  Why do we now need "journalists" to go  after government, if we have a functioning AP system?
If they didn't understand the whole picture, sure they might believe that.  One difference is, "who makes the decisions as to who get killed?"If a long and bloody war (for example the war between Iraq and Iran in theearly 1980s) could be stopped by purchasing the death of a few hundredIraqi and Iranian leaders,  I think most people would view that outcomeas being highly ethical and beneficial to society.  Just not beneficial to the leaderships, themselves.
This should have been studied and debated extensively 20 years ago.  Howmany INTELLIGENT such debates eventually occurred about AP.  (I'm not referring to CP list discussions, of course).  I could probably count themon one hand, or at most two hands.
Currently, this is true.  The history of "courts", I believe, included a kingmaking decisions about disputes of his people.  Terminology such as a "court" ("a King's Court"), "pleadings", "arguments" survived.   But soon enough I imagine that this got very boring and time-consuming for the King, sohe happily deligated this task to some trusted person, who eventually becamecalled a "judge".I use the term "court" to put this decision-making function in a familiar light.We think of a "court" as being a physical location (a room), and people, setup to make decisions.  One modern analog is "arbitration", and I could haveused that analogy.  An AP-type system will ultimately replace not merely regional defense, but also what we currently think of as "law enforcement"functions.  But these will not necessarily be monopoly-operations.
Maybe we will have to agree to disagree on this?
belli as the defense of human life, and the fact that war is tolerated
by enough people to make it possible demonstrates that application of
a "non-aggression principle" in conjunction with decisions to hire and
direct murderers can not be entrusted to either sovereigns or a
peasant rabble."
Effectively we entrust authority to do this to people chosen by vote, orappointed by these people, etc.  Why not replace this with a different version of "wisdom of the masses"?
Doesn't surprise me at all.  I've long known that Science Fiction has beenused as a way to test out new ideas, rhetorically, without having to placethem (threateningly) in modern-day fiction.

 Subject: AP: estimating odds, cryptocurrencies, status
AP should be remarkably economical.  There are economic concepts known as"current value of money" and "future value of money" that reflect the effects of inflationand the interest rate.   If a person has to pay "1 unit" of tax each year, how much should he be willing to spend to avoid this?  Ignoring inflation, and assuming the interest rate is about 3%, a person might be willing to pay (1/0.03), or 33 units to ceasethat obligation.  (approximately).  Fortunately, as my estimate above explains,if 'everyone' was willing to pay perhaps 1% of his yearly obligations, that would presumably stop the system that requires these payments.
Now, it should be pointed out that there will still have to be SOME sort of systemto run what we have called up until now "government".  But there is no reason to believe that such a system needs to be nearly as large as it currently is.
For instance, I have predicted that AP will completely replace what has been called"National Defense", not merely for America but for each geographic entity previously called a "country".  In other words, the $600 billion that we're spending might drop tounder (say) $1 billion/year.   That would certainly sound impossible to believe to aperson to whom AP wasn't explained.  
So far, no effective ones, I think.  At least, no death attributable to such a system hasbeen identified, and I feel certain we would have heard if that had happened.Sanjuro's thing of about November 2013 did not function; I felt it would not when I heard that it only accepted a minimum bid of 1 Btc, which at thetime was about $800.  I felt, and still feel, that a minimum donation at least a factor of1000 times smaller would be desirable, and probably 10,000x smaller.
The one really useful thing about Sanjuro's effort is that it exposed how people (atleast, hundreds of journalists) were going to react to an AP-type system.  His systemdidn't eventually work, but the people who wrote about it didn't know that at the time.  Therefore, I accept their reactions as being representative of 'the real thing' when it happens.
One of the reasons that government can't complain too loudly was the Federal Government's FutureMAP system, proposed for a day or so in 2003. 
An excellent subject for a debate!  But remember, if nobody had bothered to take thetime an effort to implement Bitcoin, we'd all be asking "Why hasn't anybody implementedan effective digital currency yet?  After all, I first read of David Chaum's article aboutDigicash in Scientific American magazine in 1992 or so.  It took another 17 or so years to do Btc.More later on this.
- When will they? What are their requirements and environment
to startup, and succeed?
As Nick Szabo said in May 2015, at:         " A sufficiently large market predicting an individual's death is also, necessarily, an assassination market, and similarly other "prediction" markets are also act markets, changing incentives to act outside that market to bring about the predicted events."
 But everybody has to be assured that the system will function, will play fair, and that all actors involved will get what they expect from it.
 I am paying attention to Ethereum and Augur.  A prediction market, run on an 
unstoppable distributed computer comprising hundreds of thousands of separate networked computers, means that things aren't occurring at anyspecific location, but instead are happening "everywhere".

 Subject: Instead of only bashing tor, why not discuss the alternatives?
Tor reminds me a bit of the Clipper chip, that brief attempt to implement a DES (56 bit key),key-escrowed chip for encrypted telephones that was tried in 1993. 
If the USG had simply abandoned the plan for key escrow (giving the government the keys), the world wouldarguably have been better off  (compared to no encryption at all) for awhile if they'd implemented 56-bit DES.  But, that was distasteful, in large part because it would have been a shame to build a system that was less secure than it could have been with then existing technology.   
However, I think the main impediment to implementing secure phones in that time frame (1993) was that it wouldhave been necessary to transmit data rates over the POTS (Plaint Old Telephone System) that weren't reallypractical:  Modems had gotten to about 14.4kbps by then, as I recall.  
Tor, likewise, should not be less secure than it could be.  Multiple transfer hops (as opposed to the current one-hop),decoy (a given packet 'explodes' into multiple packets, maybe only one is 'real') transfers,  padded with adjustable filler traffic, etc, should have been added by now.  Why the delay?         Jim

The one really great thing Apple ever did was to choose the Motorola 68000 microprocessor for their Macintosh computer, which had a 24-bit linear memory address space  (later increased to 32 bits), unlike the foolish 80X86 series, which had a botch called "segmentation".  (Although, I have long maintained that there would be nothing wrong with segmentation, as long as the individual segments could be made as large as any program and/or data that you could ever want to use.  The 8086/88 only allowed segments 64Kbytes in length.  Sure, later iterations allowed larger segment sizes, but by that point the limitation had been locked into software!  A segment size of 4 gigabytes (2**32) would have been just great.

References: I guess I have to laugh at this, below.  Does Hillary Clinton or her corrupt cronies really think that Americans care who, exactly, who obtained and leaked the DNC emails?  And why should we believe that ONLY ONE individual (or group) had them?  There are probably plenty of DNC insiders who are disgusted with how bad a choice Clinton is, this year.  Might at least one of them leak a master-key (quite anonymously, we suppose) to people they figure would go ahead and use it?  No doubt Russia has the talent, and certainly the motivation, but so do many other people.  
I'm waiting, hoping, that they also release a few tens of thousands of "private" Hillary emails, the ones they've been rumoring on the media over the last few days.  
We'll learn a lot.  We first heard of her private server over a year ago, as I recall.  About that time, I first heard that the deleted emails had been chosen through a process of negative-elimination:  The emails that were saved were those that contained one or more of a number of keywords.  Lack those keywords, and the message wasn't saved.  It sounds like a system that her buddies designed to be able to eliminate everything they wanted to erase:  "Just remember not to enter any relevant keyword, and you know the message won't survive."  What were those keywords?  There should have been plenty of emails that were so short they didn't make the cut, even if they were indeed government business.  It is virtually certain, therefore, that this system was designed and known to Hillary Clinton virtually from the moment it was first used.
It's way to dangerous to elect a person, Hillary Clinton, who may have foolishly depended on having a system to delete messages, when it's possible those same messages were copied, and eventually found their way to unknown others.  The blackmail possibilities would be endless.
I would have thought that by now, somebody would have performed experiments on a mock-up of her server, perhaps the same hardware and software they used, to try to determine if somebody would have been able to break in.  Offer a $100,000 reward, or something like it.

Interesting side-side-issue:  
Scientists have continued to experiment with the use of optical fibers to study quantumentanglement.   relation, of course)  They generated photon-pairs which were quantum-entangled, sent them in opposite directions, made their measurements far away, and found(as they kinda-sorta expected) that the first measurement somehow affected the secondmeasurement many kilometers away.
I read a few years ago, somewhere, that in such a test they were able to exclude the possibility of a direct-communication effect manipulating the results unless it wereat a speed of at least 10,000 c (10,000x the speed of light in a vacuum.)
Perhaps this system could be used to synchronize clocks.  Although, since the speed of light in an optical fiber is very constant over time (assuming the temperature isn'tchanging) then very good results can obviously be obtained using the far more mundanesystem.
Interesting tidbit:  A 1 centimeter change in the altitude of a clock, at about the Earth'ssurface, changes the rate of that clock by about 1 part in 10E18.   (My own calculation:  Itmight be a factor of 2 off.)    Experimental clocks of approximately this accuracy exist.
In addition, "nuclear clocks" are talked about.  (although they are somewhat hard toGoogle-search because of term confusion with the "Doomsday Clock".  here's an example:

References:  From: grarpamp I don't think there's necessarily a contradiction here.  While there do exist CO sensors which needto keep the detector heated to 400 degrees C, and therefore benefit from being connected tothe AC supply, "electrochemical cells" which have extremely low power consumption are nowavailable.   The device needs merely to 'wake up' occasionally, maybe every minute or so, interrogate the voltage on the electrochemicalcell, and sound the alarm if the limit value is exceeded.
The main concern is ensuring that the detector has enough power at the time it is necessaryto alarm to sound that alarm.  The ongoing (non-alarm) power consumption is probably much less than the self-discharge rate of a battery.   Modern alkaline-cells have a shelf-life of in excess of 5 years, andperhaps as much as 10 years, although Wikipedia doesn't state this specifically.   
In contrast, a tracking device must actively emit some sort of signal to alert some remote system toits current location, which takes power.  It must also somehow know where it is:  GPS receivers use much less power than they once did, but even that is far greater than that which a tiny battery couldbe expected to provide.  
And the amount of power available from "free RF" is obviously quite variable:  If you're 0.5 kilometeraway from a 50Kw television transmitter, that's a lot of signal strength.  Compare that with out inthe boonies, 1 km away from a cell-phone tower is not a lot.  It would make more sense to designa CO detector with solar cells on the bottom, and have people mount it on an outside window, with a rechargeable battery to store enough to get through the night.

A good case on jurisdiction is Â Â   Â "Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Environment". (1998)From the syllabus (which is not part of the actual decision):
"(b) This Court declines to endorse the âdoctrine of hypothetical jurisdiction,â under which several Courts of Appeals have found it proper to proceed immediately to the merits question, despite jurisdictional objections, at least where (1) the merits question is more readily resolved, and (2) the prevailing party on the merits would be the same as the prevailing party were jurisdiction denied. That doctrine carries the courts beyond the bounds of authorized judicial action and thus offends fundamental separation-of-powers principles. In a long and venerable line of cases, this Court has held that, without proper jurisdiction, a court cannot proceed at all, but can only note the jurisdictional defect and dismiss the suit.

The way they describe it, they send light down a cable, then watch for the reflection to come back to them.
The reflection should look the same with every single pulse of light, unless something affects it, which in this case would be the vibrations of sound.
So it should pick up sound along the entire length of cable, which would return a lot of ambient noise if you're trying to hear inside someone's house from all the way back at a utility company.
I don't know how good their audio filtering abilities are, but it seems like wherever you take measurements can't be too far from what you want to hear.

Blockchain Company's Smart Contracts Were Dumb
JUNE 17, 2016 5:46 PM EDT
Matt Levine
There's a fairly incredible trial going on in London right now. The Libyan Investment Authority is suing Goldman Sachs over some trades that they did together. To oversimplify slightly, the LIA handed Goldman a pile of money and signed some complicated contracts describing the circumstances in which Goldman would have to give LIA money back, and how much. And then everyone closed their eyes and counted to 10, and when they opened their eyes, poof, the money was gone. It was $1.2 billion. Libya is mad, and suing.
The LIA has various arguments in its lawsuit, but none of them amount to "Goldman owes us money under those contracts." The contracts specified a set of functions that took inputs (mostly, the prices of some bank stocks) and produced as outputs a set of dollar amounts that Goldman was supposed to pay Libya. The specifications in the contracts are perfectly clear; there's no dispute about how to read the contracts, or about how the functions work. Everyone agrees that the total dollar amount produced by the functions is zero. Instead, Libya's arguments take the form of: We didn't really mean what those contracts said. We didn't understand them. We were bamboozled into signing them, overwhelmed by a "swarm" of Goldman bankers, seduced -- literally -- by the bankers' offerings ofinternships and aftershaves and prostitutes. We were unsophisticated, we trusted Goldman to look out for our best interests, we thought the functions were something other than what they turned out to be.
Whatever you think about those arguments -- my own views are complicated -- they are definitely the kinds of arguments that are, like, allowed in court. The contracts specifying the functions are important. Ninety-nine-point-whatever percent of the time, derivatives contracts just work: I pay you a premium for a call option, and you promise to pay me if it ends up in the money, and if it does, you do, and if it doesn't, I shrug and walk away. We knew what we were getting into, and we got out of it what we expected. But every so often, people don't know what they're getting into, or what they get out of it isn't what either side reasonably expected. And when that happens, they go to court and argue about it. Usually one side did well out of the deal, and argues that everything's fine and everyone got what they expected; the other side did poorly, and argues that something fundamentally unfair happened and the deal should be altered.

However, see 1943 Supreme Court case Wickard v. Filburn. Â Wikipedia: Â 
In what had to have been the high-water mark for justification of Federal Government powers, from Wikipedia:
"An Ohio farmer,Â Roscoe Filburn, was growing wheat for use to feed animals on his own farm. The U.S. government had established limits on wheat production based on acreage owned by a farmer, in order to stabilize wheat prices and supplies. In 1941 Filburn grew more than the limits permitted and he was ordered to pay a penalty of $117.11. He claimed his wheat was not sold in interstate commerce and so the penalty could not apply to him. The Supreme Court stated "The intended disposition of the crop here involved has not been expressly stated..." and later "Whether the subject of the regulation in question was "production," "consumption," or "marketing" is, therefore, not material for purposes of deciding the question of federal power before us [...] [b]ut even if appellee's activity be local and though it may not be regarded as commerce, it may still, whatever its nature, be reached by Congress if it exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce and this irrespective of whether such effect is what might at some earlier time have been defined as 'direct' or 'indirect.'"[4]""The Supreme Court interpreted theÂ United States Constitution'sÂ Commerce ClauseÂ under Article 1 Section 8, which permits theÂ United States CongressÂ "to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes." The Court decided that Filburn's wheat growing activities reduced the amount of wheat he would buy for animal feed on the open market, which is traded nationally (interstate), and is therefore within the purview of theÂ Commerce Clause. Although Filburn's relatively small amount of production of more wheat than he was allotted would not affect interstate commerce itself, the cumulative actions of thousands of other farmers just like Filburn would certainly become substantial. Therefore, according to the court, Filburn's production could be regulated by the federal government."
I consider the Supreme Court's 'reasoning' in this case to be insane. Â Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Jim Bell

Nearly 20 years ago, I first heard of "3M Louvered film", thin plastic sheets with opaque black plastic molded perpendicularly to the plane of the sheet.  It would be very useful to help block the viewing of license plates from the side of the road, or above on poles or overpasses.  Google-search '3M louvered film".                  Two sheets installed perpendicularly to each other would render a license plate readable only from a limited viewing cone behind, or in front of, the car.            Jim Bell

A policeman might, and presumably has, argued that.  But go to your typical car-parts store (in America), and you will see plenty of license-plate covers which shield the plate from dirt and dust.  That doesn't mean that it is definitely 'legal', merely that most of the time, cops tend to look the other way if they can easily see the plate itself.
One actually claims that it prevents photographing the plate:    
25 years ago, I did some research into making a car 'infrared stealthy'.  The technology of (cheap)  laser radar was just coming into play.  I learned that such laser speedgun units used 905 nanometers IR, pulsed at about 25 nanoseconds.  I concluded that covering a car's corner-cube plastic retroreflectors with an IR-absorptive glass (PPG's Azurlite absorbed all but 6% of 905 nm IR).   Azurlite could also be used to cover a license plate, although it had a distinctive bluish color.  Etching the inside surface of the glass with ammonium bifluoride etchant (art stores) greatly decreased the retroreflectance from the plate itself.I found an LED, Stanley DN305,  (since discontinued)which had a rise/fall time of about 10 nanoseconds.  It would have made an excellent jammer.  Presumably, better ones exist today.

Probably very little.  The emitted laser power of the unit I had the documentation foremitted 15 watts.  Most of that would have hit the car, but only a tiny fraction wouldhave been reflected back to the laser gun.  Google search "Lambertian".       (The reflectance of a piece ofwhite paper is primarily 'lambertian':  It doesn't act like a mirror;nor does it act like a retroreflector.
I didn't and don't expect that anybody was going to re-paint their car for thispurpose.  Disabling the retro-reflectors is relatively easy.  
I understood that some of these modifications might arguably be called in violation of the law.  The main one, covering the license plate, seemsto be a minor issue.
I don't know how big the laser radar market currently is.  When I did the research in 1990-91, it was not clear how big an issue it would eventuallybe.

Sure, the fools put a nuclear reactor in a location susceptible to both earthquakes and tsunamis...and then they forgot to provide for cooling the core to prevent meltdown in case they had to 'scram' the reaction.
(A nuclear reactor ordinarily has a rather large population of 'radioactive daughter elements' that continue to decay and emit heat for hours and days after the neutron-absorbing control rods are put back into place.  This continued heat production has the ability, for a few hours, to melt down the core unless cooling water continues to flow.  In an emergency like Fukushima, they needed to provide for such continued water flow for hours, lest the core melt down.  They didn't.  It did.)

If a court were to address the issue, I think the Japanese would lose, primarily because it had been about 40 years before the earthquake/tsunami occurred.  The question would be, "Could the Japanese have prevented or ameliorated the damages by modifying the equipment between 1970 and 2010?".   I think the answer is obviously "yes".  They should have anticipated that a tsunami would short out electrical lines outside the plant's walls, rendering them unuseable.  This was a fixable problem; they simply chose to continue to operate the plant containing a known defect.             Jim Bell

How so?  It looks like it worked like it was designed to work.  The problem is, a decision had been made about making a seawall only a certain height, and putting the switching circuitry in the basement which could be flooded.  No doubt both these decisions had been approved by the Japanese involved.
Now, if it had been determined later that they wanted to protect against much larger earthquakes and higher tsunamis, they could have increased the seawall height and sealed the basement of the reactor better.  They chose not to do so.                Jim Bell

Seems somewhat over-hyped, and not especially new either.
        Jim Bell
"It could mean completely secure encryption of data, be it emails or voting - and even help beat climate change.
Researchers have revealed a groundbreaking new technique to create truly random numbers for the first time.
The new method creates truly random numbers with less computational effort than other methods, which could facilitate significantly higher levels of security for everything from consumer credit card transactions to military communications.
The new method takes two weakly random sequences of numbers,  such as air temperatures and stock market prices sampled over time, and turns them into one sequence of truly random numbers.
'This is a problem I've come back to over and over again for more than 20 years,' said David Zuckerman, who led the study.Described by one cryptography expert as a 'masterpiece,' the University of Texas at Austin research could have wide ranging implications.
'I'm thrilled to have solved it.'Computer science professor Zuckerman and graduate student Eshan Chattopadhyay will present research about their method in June at the annual Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC), the Association for Computing Machinery's premier theoretical computer science conference. They publicly released a draft paper describing their method for making random numbers in an online forum last year. Oded Goldreich, a professor of computer science at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, commented that even if it had only been a moderate improvement over existing methods, it would have justified a 'night-long party.
'When I heard about it, I couldn't sleep,' says Yael Kalai, a senior researcher working in cryptography at Microsoft Research New England who has also worked on randomness extraction. 'I was so excited. I couldn't believe it. I ran to the (online) archive to look at the paper. It's really a masterpiece.'
The new method takes two weakly random sequences of numbers and turns them into one sequence of truly random numbers. Weakly random sequences, such as air temperatures and stock market prices sampled over time, harbor predictable patterns. Truly random sequences have nothing predictable about them, like a coin toss. The new method takes two weakly random sequences of numbers and turns them into one sequence of truly random numbers.
Previous versions of randomness extractors were less practical because they either required that one of the two source sequences be truly random (which presents a chicken or the egg problem) or that both source sequences be close to truly random. This new method sidesteps both of those restrictions and allows the use of two sequences that are only weakly random.
An important application for random numbers is in generating keys for data encryption that are hard for hackers to crack. Data encryption is critical for making secure credit card purchases and bank transactions, keeping personal medical data private and shielding military communications from enemies, among many practical applications.
Zuckerman says that although there are already methods for producing high-quality random numbers, they are very computationally demanding. His method produces higher quality randomness with less effort.
'One common way that encryption is misused is by not using high-quality randomness,' says Zuckerman. 'So in that sense, by making it easier to get high-quality randomness, our methods could improve security.'
Their paper shows how to generate only one truly random number – akin to one coin toss – but Zuckerman's former student Xin Li has already demonstrated how to expand it to create sequences of many more random numbers. Read more:
