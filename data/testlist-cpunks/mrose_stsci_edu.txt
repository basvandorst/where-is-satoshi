Do atm's usually have real cameras?  I always figured most of them

I'm sure glad you wrote this.  It's about time some common sense got
injected into this thread.  And I'm glad you pointed this out.  I hadn't looked at it this way,
but I see now it's a clear extension from the "words are worse than
bombs" philosophy.

@_subject: reading mail with gnus 
I'd like to start reading cypherpunks mail with gnus, and continue
reading my other mail with rmail.  Is this possible?  I'm running
emacs 19.19; I know there were patches for an earlier gnus that
supported this, but I don't know if they work with the emacs 19 gnus.

Darn, and just as I was thinking about a powerbook 180.
If Apple buys into key escrow, I'm not buying into Apple.

I'm aware of this, but don't see its relevance to cypherpunks.

@_subject: text p.d. cryptosystems for email 
If they control the machine, anything is easily compromised.  One way
is to replace the standard crypt with a special one that secretly
saves a copy of the plaintext.
The alternatives you suggest suffer from the same problem.  If you
want to encrypt securely, you'll have to encrypt the plaintext on a
system that you trust - a computer that only you have access to is
Depending on your privacy needs, an account on a system where you
trust the administrators not to abuse their privilege may be
sufficient.  While providing less privacy than encryption, it can be
more convenient.  It will certainly make it harder for them to harrass
you.

@_subject: PGP in emacs rmail 
Has anyone written elisp code for running pgp?  I found crypt++, but
in its default configuration it only does conventional crypto, nothing
like signing, verification, and pubkey encryption.  Has someone
already done this, or am I pioneering new ground?

There's another difference between dorms and public housing.  Public
housing is the tenant's home.  In a dorm, the school is acting in loco
parentis.  That is, the school is acting in the position of a parent,
which gives them considerably more latitude.

I have one of these, it's a good phone.  I think the security will
stop only an off-the shelf scanner.  My understanding is that the
signal is not encrypted, but only phase-inverted or otherwise shifted.

@_subject: Baltimore security conference, opening session 
I attended the opening session of the National Computer Security
Conference this morning.  Actually it's been renamed to "Info systems
something-or-other", but I don't recall what.
The opening session is NIST's opportunity to take center stage, which
they did.  The most interesting information to come out of the session was that
the govt is still pushing very hard for key escrow.  Most of the
speakers mentioned key escrow, and talked about the need for business
and govt to compromise to meet the needs of law enforcement blah blah
The "distinguished awardee" is Dennis Branstad, his speech was read by
Steven Walker.  In it, Branstad claimed that key escrow is a great
gift being provided by the government to the private sector, and that
companies want it a lot.
Stuart Katzke from NIST said that "our" goal (where "our" is
computer security professionals) is to deploy secure systems, but he
believes that "we" often lose sight of that goal.  Said that govt and
industry need to find compromises so that both can meet their goals
and get systems deployed.  I belive he mentioned export laws and key
escrow as areas for potential "compromises", but am not certain; if
not stated it was implied.  My interpretation is that he claims
those who object to key escrow are getting in the way of deploying
secure systems.
Someone, I don't recall who, pointed to the european "interest" in key
escrow, saying other govts might not allow systems to be deployed
without key escrow, thus key escrow was a good thing.

Changing the email address known to netscape doesn't help.  Your email
address is in the message sent, regardless of what netscape thinks
your identity is.

Netscape doesn't need to know your email address.  Your email address
is put into the headers by sendmail.  Netscape will make a "from"
header of what you claim in the "indentity" field, but your real
address is also in the headers - "sender:" in mine.

That's a flaw in the auto-responder, which believes the false "from"

Sorry for the imprecision here.  I was referring to Netscape 2.0 on
unix here.  Changing the email address known to netscape is
insufficient for non-root users on unix systems, because sendmail will
put your real address into the headers.
The auto-responder used by the posted example page apparently isn't
sophisticated enough to extract the real address, but the address is
still in the headers for someone to extract.
For those who haven't read the script, the technique used is as
follows.  A java script sends a mail message to the author of the
script.  The identity of the sender is in the mail headers.  The
script does not look at netscape variables or otherwise get the
information from netscape or the environment.
The major point is that setting a bogus email address in netscape will
not necessarily prevent your email address from being captured in this
