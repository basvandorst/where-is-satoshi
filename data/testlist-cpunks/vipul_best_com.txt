*** TV station sets cybersex sting
With cyperporn and cybersex ranking as sensational news items on
local TV stations, Fox's Los Angeles outlet has taken the trend a
step further by ensnaring adult sexual predators. KTTV's Fox 11 News
at 10 worked with a 21-year-old woman posing as a 14-year-old to
conduct cybersting operations that led to the arrests of five men.
KTTV used the unnamed woman as bait, having her enter online chat
rooms where she was immediately targeted. The station filmed the
online seductions as well as the arrests of the men, who included an
attorney, a doctor, a retired Army officer and an investigator for
the Dept. of Labor. See story at

*** U.S. cyberterrorism report hit on encryption stance
The U.S. commission on critical infrastructure was criticized
Wednesday for endorsing the Clinton administration's policy requiring
government access to all private computer data. Sen. Patrick Leahy
said key questions had been raised about costs and feasibility of
so-called key recovery systems. "Until those significant questions
are ... answered, we should be cautious in adopting grand key
recovery encryption schemes that may exacerbate system
vulnerabilities," Leahy said. The commission's report warned key
telephone, power, water and financial systems were increasingly
vulnerable to computer attack. For story

*** Azalea releases encryption software
Azalea Software has just released three new encryption and security
products: DESTools v1.5, BlowfishTools v1.5 and SHATools v1.0. All
three packages are SDK's (software developers kits) targeting Windows
developers who need to add encryption and security features to the
applications they write. DESTools and BlowfishTools provide
encryption and decryption based on the DES (Data Encryption Standard)
and Blowfish algorithms respectively. DES provides 56-bit keys and is
used extensively in banking and finance. (PR Newswire) For the full

@_subject: What's really in PGP 5.5? 
this entirely depends on the specific protocol followed by the corporation and the employee. its not unethical for the corporation
to have access to the employee's _work_ key and data encrypted
with the key if they mutually decide it that way. The employee can always use a different crypto system for his personal data. and its not unethical for a firm to sell a key-escrow product. enforcing the use of key escrow is.

I am developing a product that would use GOST for encrypting data streams. This is mostly beacuse its design and simplicity hold
considerable aesthetic value, atleast for me. Most of the related text I have read indicates
that some SBOX sets can be cryptographically weak, and
its a good idea to use SBOX data as key data instead. Pointers?

Thanks, I shall look up Feistel-type networks. Nope, I don't understand the mathematics very very well, and that's why I asked. While I haven't seen the official GOST specs but all the reference I could find indicates that GOST specs don't discuss the process of generating SBOX permutations and GOST sboxes are not mathematically understood. Regarding the developer's ethical responsibilities with experimental technology I rather have the consumer decide (and of course document the limitations).
Thanks, Vipul

*** U.S. urged to do more to fight computer threats
A presidential panel is urging the government to increase its efforts
to combat computer terrorism, including doubling current spending of
$250 million by fiscal year 1999, the Washington Post said Tuesday.
The panel said annual federal spending to prevent hackers from using
computer networks to sabotage U.S. infrastructure and ensure computer
safety should reach $1 billion by 2004. The President's Commission on
Critical Infrastructure Protection, established a year ago after a
Justice Department review of vulnerability to terrorism, delivered a
classified 269-page report to the White House Monday, the Post said.

More than 250 U.S. Defense Department computer systems were broken
into last year and the number of attempted break-ins was projected to
double this year, a U.S. intelligence official said. The comments
that Air Force Lt. Gen. Kenneth Minihan, director of the National
Security Agency (NSA), made Saturday at an intelligence convention
were released Thursday. Urging stepped-up awareness of cyber security
issues, Minihan said the United States built its information
infrastructure on a "poor foundation -- and we will eventually pay
for it." See

*** Keep cyberporn from children, Flynt daughter says
Anti-pornography activist Tonya Flynt-Vega said Friday she was "very
disappointed" the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a law meant to keep
Internet smut away from children. Flynt-Vega, 32, daughter of Hustler
magazine founder Larry Flynt, said children tended to be much more
computer-literate than adults and were especially prone to "unwelcome
contacts" on the Internet. " ... I want there to be some laws
regulating that stuff. Don't put it in my face or my child's face,"
she said. The Supreme Court ruled June 26 that Congress violated
free-speech rights when it tried to curb smut on the Internet. For

um, i don't understand why you think these are mutually exclusive. it pretty obvious that people with similar interests will get together and form virtual communities based on common values rather than physical proximity when they have access to a communication infrastructure like the net. accidental and arbitrary interactions is the darker side of brick-wall reality, the internet is the tech to transcend it. when people have the tech they use it.
