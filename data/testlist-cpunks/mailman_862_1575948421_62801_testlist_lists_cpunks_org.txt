So here's an interesting question.
If 10,000 people on, say, April 15th did a Yahoo search on the word
Mesothelioma then clicked on the top sponsored lawyer link, would said
ambulance chaser have to fork half a million dollars over to Yahoo?
Even more efficient - how hard would it be for some clever coder to
write a few Perl scripts to do this?
Just thinking out loud.

[predicting the end of the world] has not been found agreeable to
experience." -- Edward Gibbon, 'Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'
