I have just read your conditions for releasing the information tha the group felt was necessary to evaluate your product. A couple of comments.
First, the Cypherpunks are not an organized group who can agree to your conditions. This is simply a mailing list not a corporate entity to be contracted with. To attempt to treat them as such and to use their resources for your marketing gain is, in my opinion, less than honest. If the code has not been broken in 5 months, nothing will have been proved. A better model to follow would be that used (eventually) by Netscape. Release the code for comment and make changes based on weaknesses discovered by the group.
you not release the information to Canadians? It cannot be ITAR, because it does not apply to Canadians. How can you claim that the Cypherpunks failed to break your system if you exclude its most brilliant members! .
