@_subject: [p2p-hackers] Some Clarifications regarding Egypt 
Dear P2P-Hackers,
I am an Egyptian P2P researcher and an old member of your list. I was really glad to find those two threads about Egypt in the P2P hackers list.
Technology (basically Facebook and Twitter) was a foundational part of this revolution.
History is being written as we speak,  and any simple idea, especially technology-related can
make a huge difference. Your brainstorming on this list is extremely valuable!!
i have skimmed though the threads, and excuse me if some of the thoughts are
redundant or not enough organized. (Have to rush back to the demonstrations!!) I- DIFFERENT PHASES
