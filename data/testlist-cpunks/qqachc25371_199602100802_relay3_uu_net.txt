On the other hand, of course, there are laws that are ostensibly for
the purposes of regulating businesses whose primary effect is
to limit the privacy or actions of individuals.  For instance,
California's law requiring that mailbox renters provide two forms of ID
and make their mailbox companies agents for service of process is ostensibly to "protect" consumers by regulating businesses that operate out of mailboxes (which the law claims there are 7 million of here);
it furthermore lets the Post Office specify what kind of ID to use
(which some local postmasters are far more extreme about than others),
and requires revealing True Addresses.
