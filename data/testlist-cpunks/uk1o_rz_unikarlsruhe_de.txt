According to Matthew Patton:
Do you have
  option IPFILTER
and perhaps
  option IPFILTER_LOG
Because it's integrated with the IPFILTER (option IPFILTER).
Besides: ipnat(1), ipnat(4), ipnat(5)...

[older mail]
According to Warner Losh:
How about suggesting a make variable HAS_LIBCRYPT to the FreeBSD people?
We could set it in  or something like this (to a value
meaning "we don't have it and we don't need it either), and FreeBSD could
do similar.
Another way were patching the third party program's Makefile accordingly.
We should introduce a patches-${OPSYS} directory having precedence before
the patches directory of a port. Thus we could maintain our special patches
for ports which need them while continuing to use the FreeBSD ports where
they work out of the box. I see now that this is already implemented in
, so we could just USE that.
Regards, Felix.
