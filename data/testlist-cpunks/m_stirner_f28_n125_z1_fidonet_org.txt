OK.  It seems that remail at extropia.wimsey.com ( is down.  This is a
shame, as it was the _only_ remailer that would function as an anonymous
remailer for me.  It worked beautifully while it was up.  Its apparent
demise has been reported by other users as well,
.   Several of the remailers listed (2,3,4,5) have _never_ worked using
standard cypherpunks syntax:
.   All other cypherpunks remailers, reliable or not, retain the footer
addresses automagically inserted by the host box here & are therefore
not in any way anonymous for my purposes.  There was a discussion of a
"cut line" syntax before I temporarily lost access to cypherpunks, but
as far as I know there was never any agreement or implementation (I
shall be pleased to be corrected if this is not the case).
.   Penet.fi will no longer work for me since the forced-password
implementation due to an apparent header conflict with the
X-Anon-Password: line & local host/gate software.
.   Why am I depressed?

Yes, I've received several replies like yours, but note that company use

Presumably, this is the case, though why mail is bouncing from so many
places all of a sudden when sent from all over the country, I can't say.
I was able to get pings back from penet today after having mail there
bounce.  I was writing in response to a complaint from another user in
the midwest who could no longer get mail to run through penet.
.   Charcoal's still not working.
.   Mail has stopped bouncing at cypherpunks at toad.com apparently, though
the site that receives cypherpunks for me has been getting nothing for
over two weeks.  Seems I can send, but that's it.

This episode was hilarious.  An imprisoned El Rukun was conducting gang
business via jailhouse payphone.  One chuckly FBI agent was "decoding"
the simple slang-code by which the goons communicated.  After _three
months_ he figured out enough of the code to bring an indictment.  Some
of the more amusing of these sophisticated subterfuges:
Peanut = Jimmy Carter
Hollywood = Ronald Reagan
Roman = Policeman

Our Friend = Qadaffi

It's interesting to note the length of time required for this "plaintext"
to be decoded in an urgent matter of national security.

Based on some eighteen years of personal experience, I will attest to

useful at the time.
