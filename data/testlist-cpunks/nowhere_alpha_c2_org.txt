:Basically, I refuse to type my passphrase over the net, which signing
:all my messages (this one included) would require.
Why, in heaven's name, would you have to "type your passphrase over the net" to encypher a message?

:Subject: [EFG] GA law criminalizing Spam cancels??
:Electronic Frontiers Georgia has engaged the law firm of Bondurant, Mixson, :& Elmore (specifically Scott McClain) to look into a court challenge of :HB1630 "The Internet Police Law" which goes into effect on July 1st.  We see :this as an unecessary and badly framed law.
:This law would appear to make it a Georgia criminal act to remove spam & :spews from newsgroups.  This is law OCGA 16-9-93.1
:Some information can be found at
:    :under the "Day the sites went out in Georgia" section.
:My understanding, and the perception of spammers seems to be that in order :to cancel a message, you must forge headers to become that person, thereby :falsely identifying yourself.  This seems to be in direct violation of the law
:  It shall be unlawful for any person, ... to transmit any data :  through a computer network ... if such data uses any individual :  name, ... to falsely identify the person, ... :  -- Robert Costner

Spamming aside, this strikes at my privacy and choice of anonymity.
