@_subject: Trademarking CypherSpace??? 
What these guys are selling is an embedded unix box with some crypto code
in the kernel, plus socks, sendmail, named, apache, and some fax software
pre-installed, for $5000.  Pretty high price for a 100 mhz FreeBSD box,
tho I suspect they have substantial tech support costs.
I saw no mention of trademark claims for "cypherspace" on their web site.
