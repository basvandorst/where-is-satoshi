That's the best kind for the payer, because ecash(tm) is not lost once you
send it. You can cancel the payment if it bounces or after a specified
amount of time. That's the double spending protection in ecash(tm), the
first person to deposit a specific coin gets the money.

Does anybody know how Microsoft RAS implements data encryption? Apparently
( they use RC4, but is
this stuff documented somewhere, like in an RFC?

@_subject: Microsoft RAS encryption? 
What I can find at  only deals with password authentication.
I'm more interested in the RC4 data encryption that Microsoft RAS servers
and clients are using. That is, once a PPP session is established and
MSCHAP is used to authenticate the session, the secret from MSCHAP is
reused as two RC4 keys with 40 or 128 bit keys (US or International
versions). But I can't find any documents on exactly how this works.

@_subject: Getting ecash without an MTB account 
Suppose I want to give ecash to somebody who don't have an account with
Mark Twain Bank, and I want the receiver of the coins to know that the
coins are genuine.
I would have two accounts at MTB, one for savings and one for transactions.
I want to give away a million bucks, so I deposit that amount in the
transactions account. Then I give the account password to the receiver, he
withdraws the money, and I change the password so he can't get any more
money from me. I trust the receiver not to change my password, but if he
does change it, then I can simply ask MTB to change it back, explaining
that I lost my password.
Would this work?

@_subject: PGP5i supports RSA keys? 
All versions of PGP5 supports RSA for encryption/decryption.
PGP50freeware from MIT can not generate RSA keys, but the scanned version
 can generate both RSA and DSS/DH keys.
If you have PGP50freeware, you can still import RSA keys (from 50i or 2.6)
and use them, you just can't generate the keys.

Why? All crypto has already been exported. If you're trying to get
Spamford in trouble by blowing the whistle on him for EAR violations, it
won't work. He'll just claim that he wasn't aware of the crypto export
and then he'll shut down that auto responder. It is not illegal to
export crypto unknowingly.
Spend your free time on debugging PGP5 instead.

@_subject: Getting ecash without an MTB account 
Hash: SHA1
Are you referring to the receiver anonymous protocol?
This is how I understand that protocol,
Alice wants to receive e$1 from Bob. She creates a random number, blinds
it, and gives the blinded number to Bob. He shows the number to the
Mint, asking for a withdrawal of e$1 with a signature on this coin
number. Bob gives the signed and still blinded coin to Alice. She
unblinds it and spends it, end of story.
I thought that in this scenario, Bob can spend the coin before he gives
it to Alice, so she runs the risk of receiving a coin that has already
been spent. Is it impossible to spend a blinded coin if you can't
unblind it? Or are you thinking of something totally different?

That thinking is backwards. If you sign with a DSS key, you will

It looks like they're out of business already. I tried to mail their

 says that when you buy
the software you get two OTP's in the package. There is not a single word
on how to get any more OTP's, how they are created or distributed.
Since you need a unique OTP for every party you wish to communicate with,
the OTP distribution should be a major part of the product. Yet, they don't
even mention it!

Sure, but Oz is onshore. An offshore bank is one that offers their services
primarily to foreigners, and it is usually located in a tax haven.
As far as I know, Mark Twain is the only bank in the known universe that
accepts foreign ecash customers, and their client software is the only one
that can lose your money. Chaum really has his priorities upside down.

Would this work for GSM phones as well? I believe that GSM-spam is becoming

Using hashcash on the smartcard in a GSM phone would be really neat!

You mean that it would be fine for foreigners to copy and sell the CD, but
not to put it on the net? Well, copyright law being what it is, makes this
a bit tricky. An ftp administrator have never been sentenced for copyright
violation (please correct me if I'm wrong), but CD copiers are thrown in jail
all the time. The distinction that the courts make is that of profit.
Sure, they can buy the book, but the electronic version is obviously more
useful to some people, or there wouldn't be any market for it.
I know foreigners who would like to put a copy of Applied Cryptography in
their PalmPilots, to carry around for reference. They can't do that legaly,
and that makes crypto less accessible.

Sure, but the idea here was hiding email to defeat traffic analysis. Ssmtp

firewalls where you can't run ssmtp.
transport which automatically encrypts each outgoing mail in the key of the
Eudora/PGP already does that, but you are still quite vulnerable to traffic
analysis unless you add remailers to the pot, which makes it a lot more
complicated and error prone.
A significant threat to online privacy comes from passive attackers,
because you can't do anything about them. If you have an active attacker,
you can analyze his moves and fix the bugs he uses to break root, but a
passive attack is difficult to even detect before it's too late and your
romantic conversations are headline news.
