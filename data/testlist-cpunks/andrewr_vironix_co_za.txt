@_subject: STT Authentication 
Hi All
Ramblings from a disturbed mind...
I've had a look at Microsoft's Secure Transaction Technology (STT) protocol.
The purchase order/authorization/receipt phase is authenticated using the
card holder's credential ("cred", in MS speak). The credential is similar to
a certificate except the binding is between a credit card and a public key,
rather than between an identity and a public key. What interests me is the
procedure for issuing cred's to cardholders. If I'm reading the spec right,
this is done in response to a "Cardholder Credential Request" message which
includes card details and the public keys to be associated with the card.
This data, along with a SHA hash of the data, is encrypted and sent to the
issuing bank, which then responds with a "Cardholder Credential Response"
containing the signature and key-exchange creds, also encrypted. However
there does not appear to be any authentication whatsoever on the credential
request message, presumably becuase the cardholder does not have a published
public key at the time when this message is issued. It may be that
authentication is out-of-band - e.g. the bank may phone the registered owner
of the card # before issuing a cred response message - but there is no
mention of this in the spec. If there isn't OOB authentication, then this is
a major hole in the protocol, since anyone who knew a credit card no, name
and expiry date could request a cred for that card, and then go shopping...
If someone will just tell me what I'm missing (because this is too obviously
f'd up for even Uncle Bill) then I'll go sit on top of my mountain again and
hum softly to myself.
BTW, same apears to be true for Merchant creds.

@_subject: Cryptanalysis of RC4 - Preliminary Results 
Hi c'punks & sci.cryptites
About a week ago I posted a message about weak keys in RC4. This is an update on the results of my continued 4am sessions with RC4 and shows that certain weak keys lead to an almost-feasible known plaintext attack on the cipher (well, about as feasible as the differential attack on DES, shall we say).
The attack is based on two particularly interesting three-byte key prefixes which have a high probability of producing PRNG sequences
which start with a known two-byte sequence. The prefixes are:
1.  Keys starting with "00 00 FD" which have a 14% probability of     generating sequences which start "00 00".
2.  Keys starting with "03 FD FC" which have a 5% probability of
    generating sequences which start "FF 03".
Note that the expected frequency of any two-byte output sequence is 1 in 65536 or about 0.0015%, so these key prefixes are highly unusual. I won't go into the reasons why in this post, since it follows the same reasoning as my last post, but these prefixes are
special in that they have a high probability of initializing the RC4 state table in such a way that the first two generated bytes depend only on the first three entries in the state table.
This observation is the basis for a simple known-plaintext attack
which reduces the effective key space which you need to search to
have a 50% probability of discovering a key by about 11.2 bits. The down side is that you need "quite a few" known plaintexts to make the attack feasible. It works as follows:
1.  Collect a large number of known plaintexts (and hence known     generator sequences).
2.  Discard generator sequences which do not start with "00 00" or     "FF 03".
3.  For generator streams starting "00 00", search all keys which
    begin with "00 00 FD".
4.  For generator streams staring "FF 03", search all keys which
    begin with "03 FD FC".
5.  Keep going until you find a key :-)
Clearly this attack will only discover a small fraction of the keys.
However since most generator sequences are discarded without being searched, and for those which are searched the search is 2^24 smaller than would be required to search the entire keyspace, the number of trials required to determine a key is significantly lower than for brute force alone.
Enough of an intro, here are the relevant results. Forgive my simplistic approach to maths, I'm a philosopher-come-software developer, not a mathematician. I've run the relevant simulations with 40-bit, 64-bit, 80-bit and 128-bit key lengths, and with two
different PRNGs. For the sake of consistency with my earlier paper I'll use the figures gathered for 80-bit keys (this seems to be RSA's
preferred key length for RC4), but there are no significant differences for other key lengths. The PRNG used for these tests was L'Ecuyer's 32-bit combined linear congruential generator as described in "Applied Cryptography" p. 349.
(a) Out of one million trials, keys starting with "00 00 FD"     generated sequences starting "00 00" 138217 times, and keys     starting with "03 FD FC" generated output sequences starting "FF     03" 50490 times.
(b) Out of ten million trials, arbitrary pseudo-random keys generated
    sequences starting with "00 00" 446 times, and sequences starting
    with "FF 03" 146 times. (Note the abnormally high incidence of     "00 00"; the expected mean is 152.8).
Suppose we have the output stream generated by a randomly chosen key.
The chance that it will start with either "00 00" or "FF 03", and that we will therefore search it, is:
    (446 + 146) / 1e7 = 5.92e-5
The chance that it starts with "00 00" and was generated by a key starting with "00 00 FD", or that it starts with "FF 03" and was generated by a key starting "03 FD FC" - i.e. the chance that we will
search it and be rewarded for our efforts - is:
    (138217 + 50490)/(1e6 * 2^24) = 1.12e-8
The total number of plaintexts required for a 50% chance that we will
discover one of the keys is:
    log(0.5)/log(1 - 1.12e-8) = 61 900 000
Well I did say "quite a few" plaintexts would be necessary :-) And the number of plaintexts which you expect to search in order to find the "right" one is:
    61 900 000 * 5.92e-5 = 3665
Since the total key length is 80 bits, and we are "guessing" 24 of these, each search requires 2^56 trials. Hence the total number of trials for a 50% chance of discovering a key is:
    3665 * 2^56 = 2.64e20 = 2 ^ 67.8
Since brute search alone would require 2^79 trials for a 50% chance of determining the key, this reduces the number of trials by 2^11.2.
The results are essentially identical for all the key lengths I have
tried, and in each case reduce effective key length by about 11.2 bits. So, for example, a 64-bit key would normally require 2^63 trials for 50% chance of solution; this attack reduces the number of
trials to 2^51.8 at the cost of requiring 62 million known plaintexts.
I'm still running simulations to check my maths, and although initial
results are encouraging, I don't have enough data for it to be
statistically relevant yet (generating all these sets of 62 million known streams takes time...) So consider this preliminary (again),
and I'll post the results of my simulations when I have enough Andrew Roos PGP Fingerprint: F6 D4 04 6E 4E 16 80 59 3A F2 27 94 8B 9F 40 26
