Actually, I did not claim to break SET.  What I said was:
(a)  because SET is such a complicated protocol, I am certain that it
     does have flaws;
(b)  SET does not have a clear design philosophy -- for example, it has
     modes in which a consumer's credit card number is hidden from a
     merchant and modes when it is given to a merchant.  These ambiguous
     design points in the protocol make the protocol vulnerable to misuse.
I have not made a serious effort to crack SET, yet.
