Hi there
You get emails every day, offering to show you how to make money. Most of these emails are from people
who are NOT making any money. And they expect you to listen to them?
If you want to make money with your computer, then you should hook up with a group that is actually
DOING it.  We are making a large, continuing income every month.  What's more - we will show YOU how to do the same thing.
This business can be done completely by internet and email, and you can even join for free to check it
out first.  If you can send an email, you can do this.  No special "skills" are required.
How much are we making?  Below are a few examples.  These are real people, and most of them work at this
business part-time. But keep in mind, they do WORK at it - I am not going to insult your intelligence by saying you can sign up, do no work, and rake in the cash.  That kind of job
does not exist.  But if you are willing to put in 10-12 hours per week, this might be just the thing you
are looking for.
N. Gallagher: $3000 per month
T. Hopkins: $1000 per month
S. Johnson: $6000 -$7000 per month
V. Patalano: $2000 per month
M. South: $5000 per month
J. Henslin: $7000 per month This is not income that is determined by luck, or work that is done FOR you - it is all based on your
effort.  But, as I said, there are no special skills required.  And this income is RESIDUAL - meaning
that it continues each month (and it tends to increase each month also).
Interested?  I invite you to find out more.  You can get in as a free member, at no cost, and no
obligation to continue if you decide it is not for you.  We are just looking for people who still have
that "burning desire" to find an opportunity that will reward them incredibly well, if they work at it.
To grab a FREE ID simply sign up at or reply to this email.
subject line "Give me a FREE ID  and write this phrase: "Email me details about the club's business
and consumer opportunities" Be sure to include your: 1. First name 2. Last name 3. Email address (if
different from above)
We will confirm your position and send you a special report
as soon as possible, and also Your free Member Number.
That's all there's to it.
We'll then send you info, and you can make up your own mind.
Looking forward to hearing from you!
Sincerely, P.S. After having negative experiences with network marketing companies I had pretty much given up on
them. This is different - there is value, integrity, and a REAL opportunity to have your own home-based business... and finally make real money on the internet.
