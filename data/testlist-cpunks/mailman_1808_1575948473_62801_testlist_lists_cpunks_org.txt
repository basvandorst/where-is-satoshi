@_subject: [IP] FBI plans new Net-tapping push 
Doest his meant hat if I use a generic Linux box to write some
routing or NAT software I must include an FBI module? Is it illegal
for Cisco to provide open source LinkSys boxes?
Given the attitude that the unexamined conversation is treason
shouldnbt the FBI be looking into all calls made using walkie-
talkies, between cordless phones, between extension phones? Are
corporate PBXes exempted?
Good thing that Bombay is now called Mumbai b otherwise think of all
the conversations that would be flagged as dangerous.
