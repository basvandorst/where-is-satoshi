@_subject: Sen. Leahy's "impeccable cyberspace credentials" 
Josh Crockett is exactly right here...
And that's why Declan's message about Leahy is foolish.  When you find a
champion on the Hill for one issue, you rally around him/her.  And when they
won't support you on another issue, you find another champion. If your
policy is to disown Hill allies (in this case, Leahy) who break ranks with
you from time to time, you'll quickly run out of allies.  And when you have
no allies on the Hill, you're really screwed.
