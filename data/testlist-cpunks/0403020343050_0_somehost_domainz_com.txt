distinct from the kernel.  The USAGI version uses cryptoapi which is
much more intelligent than using gmp.  I haven't looked, but I think the
USAGI/2.6 implementations are much better integrated with the linux
routing infrastructure.  DaveM and Alexey were griping about the
miserable state of FreeS/WAN in that department back when ipsec in 2.6
was being discussed.
In particular, OE may not be part of 2.6 yet (I haven't used 2.6 ipsec
or USAGI ipsec, so I don't know), but that's the only major thing from
FreeS/WAN 2.0 I can see being integrated.
And sure, you use FreeS/WAN, and a company I used to work for used it
too.  There are employees of many other companies who post to the
FreeS/WAN lists.  But that's hardly representative of the majority of

And for anyone unhappy with the linux 2.6 implementation, this forked
just a few months ago:
