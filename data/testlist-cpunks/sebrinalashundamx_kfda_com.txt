LOSE WIEGHT & ANTI-AGING WITH THIS ACAI NATURAL PILLS   Dr. Perricone's Superfoods endorsed by Oprah Winfrey on TV    No. 1: AÃ§aÃ­        Nature's Energy Fruit   It may seem odd to start this list of superfoods with one youÂve likely never even heard of. But studies have shown that this little berry is one of the most nutritious and powerful foods in the world! AÃ§aÃ­ (ah-sigh-ee) is the high-energy berry of a special Amazon palm tree.      Harvested in the rainforests of Brazil, aÃ§aÃ­ tastes like a vibrant blend of berries and chocolate. Hidden within its royal purple pigment is the magic that makes it nature's perfect energy fruit. AÃ§aÃ­ is packed full of antioxidants, amino acids and essential fatty acids. Although aÃ§aÃ­ may not be available in your local supermarket, you can find it in several health food and gourmet stores (often in juice form). A new product featuring the unsweetened pulp is now also available, and I highly recommend that you choose this form of aÃ§aÃ­.    AÃ§aÃ­ pulp contains:        * A remarkable concentration of antioxidants that help combat premature aging, with 10 times more antioxidants than red grapes and 10 to 30 times the anthocyanins of red wine.      * A synergy of monounsaturated (healthy) fats, dietary fiber and phytosterols to help promote cardiovascular and digestive health.           * An almost perfect essential amino acid complex in conjunction with valuable trace minerals, vital to proper muscle contraction and regeneration.     The fatty acid content in aÃ§aÃ­ resembles that of olive oil, and is rich in monounsaturated oleic acid. Oleic acid is important for a number of reasons. It helps omega-3 fish oils penetrate the cell membrane; together they help make cell membranes more supple. By keeping the cell membrane supple, all hormones, neurotransmitter and insulin receptors function more efficiently. This is particularly important because high insulin levels create an inflammatory state, and we know, inflammation causes aging.       WHERE SHOULD WE SEND YOUR FREE BOTTLE?? PLEASE LET US KNOW...
