Ummm, if you run your own remailer, and don't get lots of people to
use it, then traffic analysis will reveal that you are the sender
quite quickly. It will pretty much make everything in the chain before
your remiler useless. If you send your message through remailers a, b,
c, and d like this:
you -> a -> b -> c -> d -> alt.drugs.and-other-various-horsemen
and only you use c, then your effective chain is:
someone who could only be you -> d -> alt.drugs.and-other-various-horsemen
This chain is weak indeed.
