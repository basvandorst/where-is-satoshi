BAHHHHHHHHHHH....LOL.... God, that's the funniest thing I've ever read.  BY DEFINITION, care is cheaper that coverage in the average case.  You've already told us how the insurance companies have managed to aquire billions in profits.  Where do you think they got them?  They looked at the numbers and realized that for a sufficiently large group of people the cost of paying that groups medical bills will be less than the amount that groups members will be willing to pay on a monthly basis to own a safety net.
