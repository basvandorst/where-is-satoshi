Not true.
"[Curtis] Gans puts the total turnout at nearly 120 million people.
That represents just under 60% of eligible voters..."
120m * 100%/60% = 200 million eligible voters  (The U.S. population
according to census.gov was 290,809,777 as of 2003-07-01
"Bush Vote: 59,459,765"
Let's generously round that up to 65 million.
65m/200m = 32.5% of eligible voters voted for Bush
65m/290.8m = 22.4% of the U.S. population voted for Bush
I can't find an accurate number of registered voters, but one article
suggests 15% of registered voters don't vote.  That means there are
probably around 141m registered voters.  Bush didn't even win majority
support from /those/.
65m/141m = 46% of registered voters voted for Bush
