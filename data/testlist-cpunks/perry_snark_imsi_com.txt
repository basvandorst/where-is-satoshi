Mike Markley says:
Actually, there isn't much of a mortgages derivatives market -- unless
you think of CMOs as derivatives. The P&G loss was reportedly in some
interest rate swaps, although I haven't read too much about it.
Derivatives are no more dangerous than any other instrument. Its just
that because they are often highly leveraged you can make or lose far
more money as a percentage of your investment. However, there is no
requirement that you leverage yourself that much -- people just choose
to do so.
I believe you are mentioning Askin Capital Management.
They were trading CMOs, which are basically just packages of mortgages
that have had some fancy footwork performed on them to allow investors
to manage the prepayment risks.
Their problems were due to illiquidity in their market, which tended
to be for unusual or "junky" traunches of CMOs. Based on what I've
been able to read, they were using an arbitrage strategy between
mortgage securities that should have fallen in price with interest
rate fluctuations and those that should rise -- by having a balanced
book they should theoretically have been free of interest rate risk,
but because they were highly leveraged losses in their portfolio could
cause margin calls. Normally they could just have unwound their
matched positions in such a situation, but when the market turned
illiquid they got margin calls without being able to meet them and
because they were highly leveraged they swiftly lost most of their
capital. However, I'll note again they were not trading derivatives
per se -- just repackaged and securitised mortgages.
I'll point out that this is not the FinancialPunks list but the
cypherpunks list -- I'll discontinue the discussion here.

The way people tend to do this sort of thing in reality is that they
find a friendly broker who'll write a pair of tickets and then switch
them if necessary. In practice, this is traceable if anyone
This used to be a trick often practiced to move money into a
tax-deferred retirement account -- one would write two tickets, and
take the loss against one's personal account and the gain against
one's personal pension fund. This scheme was also used to defer
capital gains near a year end by creating an offsetting loss -- write
two tickets, sell the loser (so you can claim the loss) and then wait
to sell the winner for a few weeks until the New Year has come. The
IRS finally caught on and people stopped doing it. Coincidently, this
sort of scheme was at its height in the late '70s -- precisely the

Michael Brandt Handler says:
How do you pick the random section in the first place? Oh, I see, we

Its very hard to determine if a pseudrandom number generator is "good
enough" for cryptographic purposes. Many generators that look "good
enough" for doing normal work fail miserably for cryptography. If one
is using, say, a one-time pad, one has a need to generate a large
number of truly random numbers quickly. Hacked up schemes usually
don't cut it when thats the case.
If you only need a few bits, you might as well use a non-deterministic
process outside of the program's control, like a user tapping a key.
However, for work requiring significant numbers of bits, ad-hoc
methods fail miserably.
If you are going to use this for cryptography, is an ancient cipher
known as a book cipher, updated to use CD-ROMs. This is NOT a secure
way to encrypt things. Although its probably better than most silly
schemes people come up with, it isn't as good as real cryptosystems,
and they are available, so why use such a hack?
I think its good that you are evincing enthusiasm, but I really think
you ought to learn more cryptography. Remember, most obvious ideas

Thats because it isn't true.
The Fed is pretty easy to understand. Although its set up to be
quasi-independant, it more or less the government body that regulates
the banking industry and controls the money supply. It does this
by setting the discount rate (fairly small importance), by open-market
purchases of treasury securities, by making deposits in member banks,
and by altering the reserve requirements of U.S. banks. The Fed also
is supposed to act as "lender of last resort" in order to stop banking
panics by loaning money in extreme situtations to member banks.
Technically, its not part of the government the way Amtrak, the
Resolution Trust Company, and other quasi-independant bodies aren't
part of the government. However, this is largely just an illusion. Its
as much a part of the government as the post office.
Its just a central bank, like every other central bank in most
Central banks are very bad things in my opinion, however, they aren't
some evil conspiracy of the Illuminati, conspiring in the back room to
take over the world. The Fed earns no "profits". It has no
"shareholders".  Its not a "bank" in the conventional sense.
The national debt isn't owed to "bankers". Its owed to the holders of
U.S. government bonds. This includes everyone who's ever bought a
savings bond, lots of individuals, pension plans, money market funds,
insurance companies, corporations, banks, and lots of others.
Besides, if the debt was owed to "bankers", that would just be
shorthand for saying that the beneficial owner of the debt securities
would be the depositors of the bank, meaning the public at large.

"Mark W. Eichin" says:
In the context of digicash, economic discussions are relevant.
However, I think that general questions on subjects like "is the Fed a
conspiracy by the Bavarian Illuminati" and the like are probably not.
The differences between free banking and central banking are likewise
difficult to explain -- it would overwhelm this list to discuss them.
We could discuss nothing else all day for weeks.
Anyway, the real reason none of the test e-cash systems here have
taken off is multifold.
1) The market is illiquid.
2) The currency is difficult to use -- more difficult to use than
   alternatives.
3) There is nothing of value to trade for. (I wouldn't take many of
   the offered items for free, so why would I spend time trying to
   figure out the digicash system to get them.)
Basically, you need a commodity to be widely recognised as having
value and widely tradeable for goods and services, or easily converted
into something you can trade, before it can be used as money.
Something people have to remember is that digital cash is not money --
its more like "digital anonymous bank drafts". Just as a check can be
USED for money but is in fact a way of TRANSFERING money, so digicash
isn't in and of itself the source of value -- its a bookkeeping
system for something that is. That something could be dollars, gold,
cocaine futures contracts on the Bogota Commodity Exchange, girl scout
cookies, or anything else people decide is a good medium of exchange.
The choice of medium largely depends on what people want to trade
with. Right now, for whatever reason, thats generally dollars. The
savvy digital banker, therefore, will likely set up shop to allow
people to move dollars around.
Even this will not guarantee success, unless the system becomes quite
widely deployed. Of course, the incentives to do that come from the
payoffs you would get for doing so in the free market. That also
likely means that digital cash systems will involve fees -- either on
the purchase of digital cash the way Travellers Checks are handled, or
in some other similar manner.

No its not. Its easy to conduct a zero knowledge interactive theorem
proof for things that are mathematically expressable, like "I know a
Hamiltonial circuit of this graph", but it won't work for anything
that can't be expressed that way.
Example: construct a zero knowledge proof for the proposition "I know
something interesting about George Bush that you would be willing to
pay $100 to know".
A fungible thing, sometimes called "a commodity", is one for which the
all are oblivious to substitution. As an example, when you request a
dollar bill from me, you don't care WHICH dollar bill you get. When
you ask for a one kilo gold ingot, which ingot from the space of all
ingots doesn't matter to you.
Only fungibles can be traded in securities markets or deposited in
accounts. I can trade shares of IBM because you have no care which 100
shares of IBM you get. I can trade futures contracts for West Texas
Intermediate Crude because thats a very well specified substance.
Currency is ALWAYS fungible. That which is not fungible cannot be used
as a currency. In particular, "information" is not fungible. It is not
a commodity. Two pieces of information are not indistinguishable.

If no one is using it it takes up no bandwidth. Naturally, if no one

having the session makes no sense. If large numbers are using it the
technology makes considerable sense provided that what one is
multicasting is something like an IETF or Cypherpunks meeting, but if
its just a few random folk chatting, the session isn't justified --
one is spending a huge amount of networkd bandwidth on something that
Netnews or IRC is far better suited for.
