You'll fall in love with my Grandma's prize-winning salad dressing recipe. It has just the right touch of garlic, olive oil, and certain other old-world special ingredients. Best of all, it has the power to turn ordinary iceburg lettuce into something amazing. Whenever we serve it people ask for more salad! And they look at you like, "What's in this anyway?" It's a real bargain at only $2.00!
