The I2P project have an addon like this. See It uses the anonymity network only for transports and adds a higher
level protokoll for storage an delivery of mails.
The I2P-Bote mails are stored 20x and encrypted in a DHT. Bevor storing
the message, it can be send over 3,5... I2P nodes to hide the sender.
(Tahoe-LAFS stores 7x and can restore with 3 storage nodes.)
May be, it is more easy to use the Tor hidden services in a way like
TorChat and add a higer lever service for asynchronous messaging?
