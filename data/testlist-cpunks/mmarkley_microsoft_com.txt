I seem to remember from way back in high school that the number of potential moves by the third set of moves is on the order of billions of legal moves. I am also pretty sure that it is not exponential but a factoral growth. I don't think that it is possible to determine every possible game.

I should have said billions of potential states for the board after each move. If you think of the number of initial moves for the starting player its only 16 potential positions for the pawns and 4 for the knights. If the first player takes one of these positions then the second player moves he has the same 20 potential moves giving an potential state of 400 different positions after the first move. After the second move there is on the order of greater than 160,000 potential states for the board. After 3 moves it is greater than 2.56 * 10^10 potential states. I was thinking in terms of states rather than valid moves.

The derivatives market is a very dangerous place also. In yesterdays financial section here in Seattle there was an article about how Proctor and Gamble is reporting a loss of over $100 million in the mortgage derivative market. Also in RISKS Digest 15.75 there is an article with the subject ' God Grants Granite Gift to RISKS Punsters' that talks about a company losing $600 million over the period of several weeks in the deriviative market.

There was an AP story yesterday about how several states are using prisoners to input data about traffic accidents and such into databases. I believe the state that they focused on was Arkansas. An attorney received a phone call that his SSN was being sold by prisoners that had gotten it from an accident report. The state allows people to use their SSN as their drivers license number. This prisoners also have access to everything else on the report, your license number, your home address and potentially your work and home phone number. Does anybody know what other states are using prisoners for this type of work? I'm about ready to cut up all my credit cards and start paying cash for everything that I buy.

@_subject: Multikey crypto 
Since I am relatively new to the field of encryption forgive me if this is a FAQ.
Has anyone ever done anything with an encryption scheme that allows multiple unlocking keys? What I'm thinking about is a way to encrypt some data and then create multiple keys that will decrypt the data. I want to be able to encrypt a document and then give multiple people access to the document and be able to lock out a key and/or generate new keys without having to redistribute keys to everybody that already has one. I realize that this makes it easier to attack the encrypted information since there are multiple keys to unlock the data but I don't consider this a big problem. If someone wants to throw heavy duty horsepower at the problem they will crack it eventually anyway.

How well does a Tempest attack work with multiple machines in the same room? It seems to me that it would take additional equipment to filter out the different machines that are being run. It also seems that it should be trivial to create a noise generator that would make Tempest useless. Kind of like using a spark plug to foil older radar guns.

if that's
The 129 digit key was broken in 8 calendar months and not 8 CPU months, correct? If so then for most purposes a 129 digit key is more than adequate. If you are faxing a contract to someone then if the deal isn't signed in 8 months the odds are that information about it will leak from a different source than your fax. If I had information that I wanted to be secure for several years than I would consider using many more digits than 129.
As to Windows for Workgroups 3.11, I don't know anything about the security features that are included.

Perry says:
I'll definitely agree that for something as binding as a signature that I would want to have a very large key. For daily communication it seems that fairly weak keys should be more than adequate as long as they can't be broken in a reasonable amount of time. I'm  interested in what most of the people on this list would consider a reasonable amount of time though. It seems that the average person doesn't have adversaries with the know-how and computing power to break even a 64 digit key let alone a 129 digit key. Consider the group of people that broke the RSA key, they would not fit the profile of the average person, let alone the average computer user. I doubt if the local police department here could convince the NSA that they need to crack my e-mail because I might be conspiring to commit some illegal act and I doubt that they could put my e-mail out on the net saying, "here's some encoded data, does anybody know what it says?" Right now that's the only two ways that I could think of for someone to get some encrypted data unencrypted.

FutureNerd writes
It seems that the more people protect their privacy the greater the profit will be in finding ways to invade that privacy. When all kinds of information is available in more or less public places there is little, if any, reason to pay people to get this information. On the other hand if your information is closely guarded then it costs a lot more to get that information.
Definitely agree with you on these two points.

@_subject: Forbes magazine against the Clipper? 
I just noticed in the March 14, 1994 issue of Forbes magazine that there is a small
blurb about Clipper/Skipjack.
"The Administration is about to browbeat American computer manufacturers (as well as cable and telephone operators) into installing in its machines a special chip that would enable the government to eavesdrop on all computer and telephonic transmissions."
It goes on to somewhat describe the governments theory on why they need to do this. Then the article says the following.
"This is a really dumb idea. High-tech exports will be devestated. Foreigners aren't going to buy equipment with such a decoding device. More to the point, criminals and terrorists won't either."
"The Clinton Administration promises that the enormous power that the Clipper Chip gives the feds will not lead to abuses of our privacy. Baloney."
This is not a full reproduction of the article but covers the main direction of it. All quotes are fully intact and not paraphrased.

Disney is a pretty paranoid company. I was there about 13 years ago with some friends and a couple of the people I was with decided to take a 'joint' break in the woods. They looked around and, not seeing anyone, ducked into the bushes. Within about 30 seconds several security guards came running and escorted them out of the park. The guards were not worried about what they were smoking, just that they had gone off the designated path. I've always wondered how the new so fast.

Last night (4/16/94) both the Discover Channel and A & E Network ran specials on the OSS and the part that they played in helping the Allies win World War II. It was kind of interesting to see what went on back then. I didn't watch the whole thing because I grew tired of watching grainy black and white footage of people walking through mud and water in rain forests on Pacific islands. I'm just curious if there is any connection between these broadcasts, which were quite rah-rah about the need for covert intelligence agencies, and the current Skipjack debate.

Sounds like a very easy scheme to break. Say I suddenly decide that I don't like your posts or Tim Mays posts. I can get you kicked off by using anonymous accounts to say that you're a nuisance. It seems to me that leaving the list open is better than trying to control it. An example of the danger of automation has already been shown on this list. Last week someone unsubscribed everybody using the automatic features of the remailer. I'd rather have access to all of the posts and make my own decisions about the contents rather than have a potential for one aggrevated individual take out some meaningful content because of a personal vendetta.

<< partial quote removed >>
I would have no problems at all going to court as a solution. Posting so called 'flamebait' does not make it right for someone to respond with attacks on the character of the original poster. If you must post responses to flamebait then attack the content of the article. As to the comments about contract murder, If you chose this route based on the economy of it, what are you going to do when you are arrested for the murder? I don't think the courts are going to buy a plea of "It was cheaper to deal with the problem this way."
I don't think that this type of litigation is going to impact the free flow of information. Attacks on the character of the poster of the information are more likely to limit the flow than anything else. I'm not trying to sound PC here because I personally find the PC movement very offensive, but if you have a problem with someone deal with it privately and don't air your dirty laundry in public.

What about being denied a job because you have been treated for some disease? How about being denied a loan because your medical history has a profile that indicates that your life expectancy is shorter than the duration of the loan?

@_subject: On the crime bill and remailers 
Why not make distributed remailers then? You could set up a chain using either mail or ftp or ? that would take all messages and fragment them into nice 1K blocks and then either mail or otherwise transport the blocks to other physical machines, these machines would then follow the imbedded instructions on how to reassemble the blocks into a coherent message and mail it out. Admittedly there is no sure fire method to prevent someone from monitoring all of the traffic generated but it should be possible to generate so much traffic that just wading through the volume would take more time than is practical. Also by encrypting all packets going between remailers and making the packets uniform sizes should help make monitoring more difficult.
I'm not sure that I'm worried about the government monitoring my communications as much as I'm worried about individuals with bad intentions monitoring my communications.

This is not entirely true. If I log in as 'guest' I cannot modify just any key in the registry. I can only modify the ones that I have permissions to change.  Also if you know what you are doing you can set permissions on any key in the registry so that it can't be modified by just anyone.  I can also modify the account permissions so that if a logon attempt fails, after a specified number of retries the account is locked and will not accept logons until the administrator unlocks the account. I'd recommend that you get a copy of Windows NT and the Windows NT Resource Kit, install it and play around with the security system before you make generalized statements about it.
