My thinking, when I first proposed what are now called Warrant Canaries,
was to rely on the U.S. constitutional protection against ex post facto. In
the same way that you can never know what laws might someday be passed
which could criminalize current, lawful, behavior or speech, a service can
never know in advance if they might someday receive a warrant or NSL. Can
someone be compelled to refrain from free speech because someday that
speech might be prohibited? If more than one person is engaged in the
creation or publication of a Warrant Canary could it be viewed as a
conspiracy? Can someone be compelled to speak falsities under court order?
Until there are prosecutions which reach high enough in the Federal courts
we may not know.

Coming in a bit later here. To me the essence of the reasoning for the fork
is to head off the possibility that sometime in the not too distant future
the demand of bitcoin users to transact on the blockchain will exceed the
supply. That certainly might happen if fees don't respond to supply-demand
economics. Those pushing bitcoin to compete with MasterCard/VISA are, IMHO,
a bit crazy. Like shoemakers always reaching for a hammer every time these
people see a transactional opportunity they reach for the blockchain. I
think that's just plain silly. Bitcoin is not well suited for all
transactional situations. In the longer-term it seems great to replace, for
example, SWIFT and bank wires but rather poor for those that require cheap-
or ultra-cheap real-time settlement whereas some alternatives seem
tailor-made for this.
Then again maybe I am missing the key reasoning for this fork.

References: During the early 90s I worked at Cylink, a Crypto AG competitor. We too
received a NSA visit about weakening products sold to certain clients
(e.g., so-called narco-terrorists). I and the other directors were told of
this (because we had legal responsibilities and liabilities) at a meeting.
I assume we made the changes requested (e.g., weakening the RNG to NSA
specifications). The special units were sold through a selected distributor
in Louisiana (probably also a NSA contractor).

MaidSafe (MS) is an inadvertent (apparently due to a lack of historical
information) attempt to realize the experiment Jim McCoy, Bram Cohen, Zooko
O'Hearn and I set out to perform with Mojo Nation. They are doing this with
the advantage of the experience of bitcoin. MN was sort of Freenet +
digital currency. Unlike the file sharing systems that came before Freenet
is publication-based. Both file sharing (FS) and publication content
distribution approaches have their pros and cons.
FS is simpler but offers little or no plausible deniability about the
sharing activities. Publication offers much better deniabilty but more
complex and requires more resource commitments on the part of its users.
Both suffer from limitations based on popularity. MN tried to find a sweet
spot by adding a resource-based currency to solve the persistence problem
by paying user clients to offer storage and communication bandwidth.
Unfortunately, MN never really got off the ground, due to a lack of
funding, but it got far enough to encourage Bram to create BitTorrent and
Zooko to create Tahoe LAFS. I tried to get Bram (and some others through
client add-ons) to include some sort of digital currency to BT but it never
McCoy patented MN's content distribution systems with resource-based
currency around 2001/2. Not sure if the patent is still in force, if Jim is
even aware of MS or if he's even care if MS appears to be using MN's

Frank Chodorov's, The Rise and Fall of Society <
pretty much lays out the scenario that societies start in anarchistic ways
but almost always, and foolishly, gravitate toward transferring powers to
"authorities". These eventually lead to a formal government, that becomes
The Stat,e which abuses its citizens and eventually falls or is overthrown,
casting society's order into chaos/anarchy, only to begin a new cycle.

On Wed, Oct 28, 2015 at 9:59 AM, Georgi Guninski Does it matter whether the crowds can do accurate predictions if the main
purpose is for special actors with the skills and interest to be encouraged
to create outcomes that are being wagered upon. I've not looked closely at
Augur but back in Cpunk days stumped for PMs that included forwards,
similar to financial futures, but where the participants could create
contracts which narrowed the prediction windows to months, weeks or even
days within the greater expiry period (e.g., Dec. 31, 2015) but were not
required to specify which month, week or day . By enabling such
sub-contract narrowing the benefit for an accurate prediction scales with
its temporal ratio with the general contract thus increasing leverage and
benefit to special actors.
