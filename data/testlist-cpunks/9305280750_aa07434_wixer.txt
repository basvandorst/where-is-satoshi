I am not asking that you take it on trust.  If I were I wouldn't
be revealing the details of the encryption method and I wouldn't
be subjecting the software to critical examination.
You omit to point out that Kahn also discusses the cryptosystem
invented in the late 18th Century by Thomas Jefferson.  I'm not
aware that Jefferson was a "professional" cryptologist or that he
was "credentialed" in this field.  Yet his cryptosystem was
sufficiently strong that even after 1922 "other branches of the
American government used the Jefferson system, generally slightly
modified, and it often defeated the best efforts of the 20th-century
cryptanalysts who tried to break it down!  To this day the Navy
uses it."  (Kahn, p.195 of the hardbound edition.)
This shows that your distinction between "professionals" (by
implication, the experts) and "amateurs" (by implication, the
self-deluding fools) is false.  There is no such clear-cut
distinction.  Whether a cryptosystem is strong or not has to be
decided by an examination of the system itself, not on the basis of
whether its author has attended cryptology classes at M.I.T.
XORing the plaintext with the outcome of a linear congruential PRNG
is a very simple-minded way to use a PRNG.  Such operations are
certainly amenable to mathematical analysis.  No doubt you've read
your Abraham Sinkov on "Mathematical Cryptanalysis" and other such
works, where the solving of simultaneous equations in several
(perhaps many) unknowns may yield a solution in some cases.  Yet I
fail to understand why you assume that someone (even someone
"uncredentialed") who uses PRNGs in a cryptosystem will necessarily
do so in a simple-minded way.  I can't imagine why any intelligent
designer of a cryptosystem would commit that error.
