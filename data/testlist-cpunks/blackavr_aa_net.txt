As one of those "ADD" kids back in the '70's, the dextroamphetamine
I was given actually did seem to calm me down. Of course, coffee
also put me to sleep then. Happily, that situation has reversed itself as I've grown older. *grin*

Coffee usage seconded here...I've tapered down to about two pots or so
a day from four or more, due to the tolerance I was developing. It's
about the only thing that gets anything done on time.  While I can
understand and agree with Tim and Mike's points about government control
and "making creative people fit in", there is a point where creativity is the only thing possible, to the exclusion of all else, such as paying
bills on time, doing necessary work, or just interacting with others.

Gotta spend more time at the range...*grin*
Just as a technical aside, the "entry" vests are becoming much more common,
and can often stop up to 7.62 NATO, sometimes even .30-06 AP rounds. The
handgun rounds don't even faze wearers of this vest. They'd be likely to go
through the Lexan face shields, though (hint hint...Mozambique drill).
Same bunch are also working to ban civilian ownership of bullet-resistant
vests...seems like a pattern developing here, doesn't it?

Been there. Done that. Bad idea to have the Jacob's Ladder out as "atmosphere" for a party, especially one where alcohol is available...
"Hey, that's pretty cool...what is it?"
"It's a Jacob's Ladder...careful...it's hot."
(Time passess...Darwin and Jack Daniels intervene)
BZZZZZT! "Yeow! That thing burned me!"
"Well, what were you doing?...I told you it was hot!"
"Uh...I was trying to light my cigarette on it."

Well, I work in Tacoma, and have thought of visiting...PNW area physical meet, anyone? A jail is a reasonably appropriate setting, If this
horrid legislation isn't stopped, just think of it as house-hunting ;->
Has John Young sussed out the visitor situation yet?
