It's possible that the attack in the paper isn't perfectly effective.
It's also possible that the government isn't aware of the paper, or at
least hasn't organized enough yet to mount an attacked based off of this
paper. (some beauracrat in power is spending money on this piece of
malware, wants all resources behind it, or maybe other political bullshit,
and so as always the government is slowing itself down)
And finally, it's possible that TSR uses additional layers of protection,
like VPN through countries outside of US jurisdiction, so that even when
you unwrap tor TSR remains hidden.

It's only a good tactic if people actually switching from using dictionary
words to using something with higher entropy. More likely though, you'll
start to see things like 'bbbddq' or 'cmplt sntnce,' and the users will
still be susceptible to dictionary attacks.
It's important to remember that a good dictionary attack has a dictionary
that is much larger than a list of words in different languages, it also
has common patterns. This sort of restraint probably reduces the usage of
dictionary words but increases the usage of other common patterns.
I don't like it.

The xkcd comic doesn't really apply anymore. Dictionary attacks have gotten
to the point where they can crack 'momof3g8kids' and 'Coneyisland9/,'
and apparently have dictionaries breaking 100 million words. As password
attacks get better and better at predicting human patterns (and hardware
gets faster), you are going to need to completely generate your passwords
at random in order to defend against dictionary attacks.
Which means the current password model is broken, as we all know it has
been for a while. Why isn't there a stronger effort to replace it with
something like a universal public key system?

How do you think something like that could be managed?
Bitcoin is only deflationary because the number of people who use it is
growing faster than the number of coins in circulation. But how can you
measure the number of people who are using it, and how can you measure how
much they are using it? (IE are they speculating, are they actually using
it to hide money from their government, are they buying needs like
Any cryptocurrency hoping to 'appreciate by at most 5%' has to have some
reliable metric for measuring it's value in the real world. Otherwise coin
generation algorithms are just a shot in the dark, hoping to mimic the
expected growth of the coin or having some authority that can provide input
about it's real dollar value. And anything that tries to get insider
metrics will need some defence against liars and sybil attacks.

You've validated my statement.
Your problem is if bitcoin becomes a world economy. That means bitcoins
usage grows by something like 2 orders of magnitude. Except that bitcoins
are already halfway mined, which means that the circulation will not keep
up. That is what drives the price up.
If you want a currency that will scale with it's global usage (IE when the
market cap hits $21 trillion, there are 21 trillion in circulation), you
need some mechanism that knows how to equate 1 bitcoin to 1 dollar, that
way more bitcoins can be printed as the market cap goes up.

Bitcoin has a lot of problems.
Andy, the problem isn't the denomination, the problem is that Satioshi has
5% of all the currency, and the Winklevoss twins have another 0.5%. If
bitcoin becomes worth 100 trillion dollars, they've got a solid 500 billion
for being nobody and doing nothing. That's a problem to me.
Another problem with bitcoin is that the blockchain won't scale. Another
problem is that nobody knows how to price transaction fees. And then
there's the selfish mining problem.
I think though that we'll see other cryptocurrencies that solve these
problems. Bitcoin is overinflated, and while the current alt coins aren't
offering much in the way of competition.
I'm working on one right now. It's not built but the idea is to use
proof-of-contribution instead of proof-of-work, where contribution is disk
storage contributed to a distributed network. The disk storage is used to
house the blockchain, but it can also be sold on a market for people to
use. Theoretically, this gives people a way to price the currency (using
the value of cloud storage vs. the price of storage on the network using
the network currency).
The tricky part is preventing cheating, but I think I have a decent
I don't however know a good way to distribute currency to the network, for
the problems I was explaining to Jim Bell. Storage is currently getting
cheaper at an exponential rate, and I have no idea how to predict the
volume of users over time, nor a good way to measure the volume of users as
immune to sybil attacks. How do you prevent the early adopters from
becoming stupid wealthy if the currency takes off?

As I was telling Jayvan, the idea would be that early adopters use the
currency for its inherent uses to them, as opposed to its speculative
Right now, bitcoin is almost exclusively speculative. It's worth a lot of
money because the value has been increasing consistently. That's tulipmania.
In a perfect world you would have some way to protect a currency against
speculation. The volatility in bitcoin makes it less useful as a currency,
therefore the speculation is damaging bitcoin.
I don't have a solution, and I'm not suggesting one, I'm merely suggesting
that a solution might exist that would be a substantial improvement.
If bitcoin was based on something that had inherent value, say cloud
storage, then a spike in value would be followed by a spike in the amount
of storage being contributed to the network (bitcoin currently does this, a
spike in price is followed by a spike in mining). The key here though is
that the network would be protect from dramatic dips in value. When bitcoin
drops in price, all of the abundant mining does nothing to save bitcoin,
because the bitcoin mining doesn't actually add any value to the network.
Nobody cares how many petaflops the network is pulling, because the
petaflops can't be put to use somewhere else.
But if the mining was based on cloud storage, a dramatic drop in the price
of the currency would result in a dramatic drop in the cost of storing data
on the network. That's something that actually has use, and so people would
let the price fall unreasonably low (instead they would find a way to make
use of the cheap storage). This would allow the currency to ride arbitrary
spikes in price while being protected against arbitrary drops in price.
Jim, the amount of mining being done on the bitcoin network has no impact
on the price. The price might have an impact on the volume of mining, but
because the mining is specific to the bitcoin network (double sha2 hashing
or something like that) it can't be sold or used for other applications.
Bitcoin mining is only good for bitcoin mining, which means the demand for
the mining is exclusively based on value of the bitcoins being mined every

Joe, the only reason that the price of cloud storage would fall is if
demand for cloud storage falls. The value of cloud storage over time should
be fairly stable, perhaps not as stable as today's US dollar but certainly
more stable than bitcoin is today.
But in the case of tulips, bitcoins, etc., their stability was only derived
from their speculative value. Bread will be reasonable stable, because
people don't speculate in bread. Bread has a minimum price, because there
is a limited supply and a clearly defined need. All commodities are not
equal. Bitcoin is one of the worst I can imagine, but the tulips during
tulipmania take the cake.
I believe you can regulate cloud storage in a way that prevents fraudsters
from manipulating it. The only assumption I need is that the majority of
the network is honest. You can use hashing + random strings to confirm that
a person still has the file they are hosting. You only need then to be sure
that the person hosting the file and the person uploading the file are not
in cahoots. You can achieve that by making a random mapping between people
and hosts, and only picking the host after a person has announced how much
file storage they wish to rent (and paid for the first month). This makes
it too expensive to host files on your own machines, because you have a
very low probability of getting the opportunity to store a file on your own

Yes but it still doesn't compare to the price fluctuations of bitcoin. But
you are right, everything has fluctuation in price. I merely wanted to show
that some thing have a more volatile price than others. The US bond is a
typical financial example of something that doesn't fluctuate dramatically
in price. (And even that still fluctuates, but very gradually by comparison
to stocks & commodities).
So, yes, by tethering a currency to the value of cloud storage you are
still limited by the fluctuations of the value of cloud storage itself. But
at least now you have a concrete way to price your currency, and I think
it's reasonable to assume that the value of cloud storage won't be
decreasing any time soon. (Price per TB may decrease, but we don't tether
the currency to the value of 1 TB, we tether the currency to the value of
$1 worth of disk storage hardware).

I have faith that additional cryptocurrencies will be launched/released
that are substantially better and different from bitcoin. Bitcoin is just
the beginnning, and ultimately I don't think it will make more than a few
years farther before there is an unquestioned replacement.

I hadn't though about it this way until now, but having the ability to
achieve full anonymity on the internet enables things like this, and
assassination markets might not be the first or most viscous thing enabled
by anonymity.
I can imagine that if assassination markets were to take off, you'd see
some large bounties (in excess of $100k) on every major politician in the
world. Pretty much any figure of high popularity would probably have some
sort of assassination bounty on their head, because the more popular you
are, the more haters you have.
What other sorts of unacceptable things could you do given fully anonymous
money coupled with a fully anonymous internet identity? I can think of:
website takedowns
funding murder, rape, arson, etc.
bombing certain buildings
funding smear campaigns (say, tear the clothes off a popular celebrity or
bounties for drugs, child porn, etc.
You could basically attempt to crowd fund any illegal activity.

Tor is a low latency network in the sense that packets are forwarded as
soon as they are received. Outwardly, it may not appear as a low latency
network because ping times can exceed 30 seconds, however from a security
point of view Tor is a low latency network.
A high latency network is one that holds onto traffic until it has a huge
batch to send out. With enough traffic, you could theoretically implement a
high latency network that is faster than Tor, but a high latency network
could also theoretical take days to respond to a request.
With Tor, if you are observing every node in the network you can guess at
people's identities by correlating traffic. If one node sends exactly X
bytes to a node that sends the same number of bytes to the next node, you
can assume that the two nodes are connected in a circuit.
In a high latency network, you would wait to send data to the next node
until you have many different requests to send to the next node. This makes
traffic correlation a lot harder because you can't distinguish a particular
request of X bytes from the other requests that are being sent over the

The problem is that you have a bunch of your own coins, so you are mining
the chains that have been announced, but you are also mining possible
chains that involve you that you never announced.
So if I never announce that I destroy 10 coin days, but I have 10 coin days
to destroy, there is an alternate reality that I'm also mining, If I don't
like the current chain, I can add my own coin days to a different fork in
the past to make that fork now the heaviest fork. Then I announce it.
Especially if I'm working with a bunch of other people, they can add their
own coins and we can work together to make it the longest chain. If it
becomes the longest chain, they get back any coins they destroyed in an
alternate history.
So basically, it's very cheap for a set of collaborating nodes to build a
forest of alternate chains, and the longest can change anytime we
collectively alter the history or add another fork somewhere to make it the
new longest. It's relatively inexpensive to balance all these forks.
So it works as long as the powerful individuals aren't mining multiple
chain simultaneously. But what's to stop them? So it's ultimately not very
secure once powerful groups start attacking the currency.
