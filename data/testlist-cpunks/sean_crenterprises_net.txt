@_subject: CDR: $1,000.00 for $10 - Would You Spend It? 
Would you be willing to spend $10 dollars if I told you that you could have
$1000 within 1 month? You send me $10 dollars and I will email you the way to
financial freedom. You are spending less for this information than most people
spend for lunch.  And what you get is so much more.  If you do not make at
least $1000.00 within 30 days, I will send you a $100.00 back.
Thats how much I know this works.
Try it?  What do you really have to loose?  $10?  What does $10 do for you
anymore.  But a GRAND, that can do something for you!
Email me, sean at crenterprises.net for the address to mail your $10 today.
It will be the best $10 you EVER spent.
