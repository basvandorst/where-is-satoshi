I have not been a CompuServe subscriber for years.  But I do remember how things worked.
It is my _assumption_ that the Usenet gateway operates by importing all Usenet news into the CompuServe system, at which point users can access it.
CompuServe is not location-dependant.  The network operates exactly the same regardless of calling location (indeed, the system doesn't even know where you're calling from I believe).  It is a worldwide CompuServe Network that people use to access it.  This network just allows dialups and then gets the users connected to the CompuServe computers.  The main computers handle all traffic.  They don't are location-independant, making it impossible to block access based on location.
