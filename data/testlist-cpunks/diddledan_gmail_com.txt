References: the quote is from a savant called "Daniel Tammet":
the clue is to count primes, not just count. I got as far as spotting that
the ciphertext has the words "clue" and "tip" where clude is at character
locations 11, 12, 13 and 14 - 11 is a prime. I gave up after reconstructing
what looked like a base64 encoded string by counting all the primes from
teh first 1000 prime number set starting from the prime "3" because the
number 3 is located very close to the word tip and happens to be a
prime-numbered distance from the word "clue". I also reconstructed a
hexadecimal value "AAD50AD65B52324ECB602D12FA2477F" by stripping all
non-hex characters from the base64 string that I reconstructed
I don't know if any of that is the correct way of approaching the problem
because I'm not a security expert. (I monitor this list for early warnings
of potential issues with softwares that I run rather than because I'm
clever.) If I'm on the right track maybe someone else can get further and
win the ~$200, but it isn't going to come my way, unfortunately, as like I
said above I've given up (I feel like I'm close though).

References: I also forgot to mention that the ciphertext also includes the readable
words "IF", "THEN", "RUN", "you" (next to tip) and "URDAD" besides those I
already mentioned.
