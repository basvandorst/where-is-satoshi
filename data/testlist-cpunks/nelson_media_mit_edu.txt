@_subject: [crypto] Avatar Protection? 
Ah, the age-old question. This is the same question as "is there a way
for me to show a web page to someone and not let them copy it?", "is
there a way I can loan someone my CD and not let them copy it?", etc.
If you have control of the viewer, the answer is trivially yes. If you
don't, then it's not.
Digital watermarks / fingerprints are one alternative - if someone
steals it, you can at least prove whom it was stolen from. Or you
might be able to exploit some of the structure of VRML to show people
an avatar but not ever reveal the *whole* thing for copying. But in
general, this sort of problem seems to demand a social solution
(intellectual property law), not technical.
ObLogos: all things are true

@_subject: summary of talk by Birgit Pfitzmann on "Asymmetric and Anonymous Fingerprinting" 
I just heard an interesting talk by Birgit Pfitzmann of the University
of Hildesheim on "asymmetric and anonymous fingerprinting". I thought
I'd write up a little summary of the techniques she presented, what
they are good for. More detail (including papers) is available on the
web at
  see below for specific references
Quick summary:   background for what fingerprints are and what they're good for
  traditional fingerprints are symmetric - buyer and merchant both
    have the fingerprinted data
  scheme for asymmetric fingerprinting so only buyer has the fingerprint
    but merchant can still trace fingerprint
  scheme for anonymous asymmetric fingerprinting so buyer remains anonymous
Fingerprinting is something like watermarking. The basic idea is
giving merchants of data some way to protect themselves if
unauthorized copies of the data are made. Watermarking is useful for
proving that a document came from some provider. Fingerprinting goes
further in that the merchant gives different buyers subtly different
copies of the data - if a copy shows up, the merchant can look at the
fingerprint imbedded in the data and figure out who leaked the copy.
Traditional fingerprinting has a few hard problems. First, the
fingerprint marks need to be embedded in the data without causing any
significant change to the data itself. But this goal is in tension
with the goal of having the fingerprint survive through potentially
lossy transforms. Ie, if I want to fingerprint an audio stream I could
modify some of the least significant bits. But then if that audio
stream were compressed through some lossy filter the fingerprint might
be removed. Furthermore, you want to make it difficult for multiple buyers to
collude to remove your fingerprint. Ie: if two buyers compare their
purchased data they can identify the parts that are different and
conclude that these parts are part of the fingerprint. A good
fingerprint coding will make this sort of collusion difficult,
although there's a tradeoff between the size of the fingerprint and
the number of colluders you can protect against.
In a typical fingerprint protocol the merchant calculates the
fingerprint, applies it to the data, and then gives the marked copy to
the buyer. This is OK except that it means that if an illicit copy of
the data shows up no one can prove whether it was the buyer who was
responsible for the copy or if it was the merchant. At first glance
this might seem silly (what incentive does the merchant have to make
illegal copies?) but you can imagine several scenarios where this is
a problem. For instance, the buyer wants to be sure it's impossible
for the merchant to frame him or her. Also if the merchant's data
storage is insecure then someone could steal the merchant's copy and
the buyer would be falsely accused.
So traditional fingerprints are something like symmetric
authentication schemes: both the merchant and the buyer have the
secret. The asymmetric fingerprint scheme presented provides a way for
the merchant to guarantee that the buyer gets a fingerprinted copy of
the data but *the merchant never has a copy of the data with the
fingerprint*. Ie: the fingerprinted version is a secret that only the
buyer has. This is analagous to asymmetric authentication: people can
check that the fingerprint belongs to a buyer but they can't generate
it. If a copy with the fingerprint is released then the world knows
which buyer is to blame.
The details of how this is accomplished were presented but I confess I
didn't follow them very closely. Each buyer has a public/secret key
pair: the fingerprint is keyed to the buyer's secret key. With a bit
commitment algorithm it's possible to arrange it so that the merchant
can generate a fingerprint based on the buyer's secret key without
actually seeing the key or the fingerprint itself. The merchant can
check if a copy of his data came from a buyer by checking the
fingerprint with the buyer's public key. I'm sure the paper has the
details of the actual algorithm.
The system sketched above is not anonymous - the merchant knows the
identity of the buyer. The next goal is to make it possible for a
buyer to get a fingerprinted copy of data from the merchant without
revealing his or her identity. Full anonymity is currently not
possible. I didn't follow this very well, but my understanding is
there's some scheme where the buyer registers a pseudonym with a third
party who then works with the merchant to perform the transaction. The
third party doesn't need to be trusted. Consult the web site for details.
Overall, this work seems like a nice improvement on fingerprinting
schemes. The asymmetry seems like a big win to me. The two directly relevant papers are linked from     Birgit Pfitzmann, Matthias Schunter: Asymmetric Fingerprinting;

Me neither! But the approach of requiring code signatures so you can
at least break the fingers of whomever damaged your machine does have
some merit.
This is kind of like running servers in Unix as another user in a
chrooted partition? That doesn't work, either.

@_subject: Running code on a machine you don't trust (was Re: Executing Encrypted Code) 
Yes, interesting indeed. It would also partially solve a problem I've
been thinking about: how can I safely run code on a machine that I
don't trust?
I'm working on some mobile agent / distributed computation research.
The basic model is that I send an agent to a server (say, a Java
interpreter) running somewhere. A lot has been written about security,
how to protect the server from malicious agents.
But what about protecting agents from malicious servers? Possible
threat models include servers that steal an agent's propietary code
and data or servers that deliberately misexecute the agent's code. The
latter threat model is under serious consideration with the
distributed DES cracking project that's being designed now.
The ultimate solution is trusted hardware on the server end. I think,
for a variety of reasons, this is really unlikely to be widly
deployed. But bringing the trusted hardware needed down to just a
black-box CPU that decrypts on the fly is a neat idea.
Other ideas include obfuscating code (protects against theft),
splitting up your computation across multiple machines (spread the
risk of theft), independently verify the results of remote
comptuations (protects from spoofing), or build some reputation
mechanism for servers (so bad guys are identified). None of these
solutions is very satisfying.
I suspect that really guaranteeing safety to mobile agents is
impossible, or at least very difficult, without trusted hardware. But
I'm not 100% sure. There are some interesting notes in Applied Crypto
2nd about performing computations on encrypted data (p.540). These
algorithms seem to be of very limited application. Or are they?
If anyone has any thoughts on this issue, I'd love to hear them. If
you send to cypherpunks, please also mail me privately as I'm going
offline for a few days..

What, a discussion of cryptography on the cypherpunks list?
What about stego in IP itself? It's been awhile since I've looked, but
aren't there some bits one could subvert in the TCP/IP headers themselves?

@_subject: New US regs ban downloadable data-security software 
I can at least vaguely understand the rationale behind restricting the
export of cryptography. But I don't even begin to comprehend
restricting the export of data security software. What is going on
here? Whose idea is this, what is the agenda?
Is the US government really prepared to take on all the producers of
virus protection software? Symantec and IBM are pretty big players to
upset. And they don't even have the "drug dealers and terrorists"
bugbear to defend this particular export restriction.
In my more cynical mood I'm afraid that what's going on is the US
government is trying to protect its capability to wage information
warfare. Could they get away with this?

A full page ad from the January 14, 1997 New York Times:
  Dear Mr. Speaker:
    If you'd rather not have
  your phone conversation
  overheard and printed word
  for word in the newspaper,
  next time use an Omnipoint
  wireless phone instead of a
  cellular phone.
The ad then explains that cell phone eavesdropping happnes all the
time, and offers Omnipoint, "a new 100% digital wireless phone system
that operates on a technology far superior to cellular. It encrypts
your voice so no one can listen in on your conversations. Or capture
any personal data transmissions."
It's a pretty funny ad.

@_subject: Password pirates plunder XXX sites, from The Netly News 
[about people stealing passwords to porn sites]
Maybe so, maybe not.
That profile's not exactly accurate. Some of the folks running porn
sites are very sophisticated. More to the point, I don't know of *any*
site that does the sort of protection proposed above. I don't think
it's an easy thing to do. An enterprising person could probably turn
quite a few bucks selling that sort of system.
But do the porn sites want it? The stolen passwords might partly serve
as free advertisement. The situation might be similar to (some kinds
of) pirated software. The stolen version acts as a teaser but
(hopefully) the consumer will eventually pay himself in order to have
more convenient access.
