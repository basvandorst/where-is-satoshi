@_subject: Timed-release crypto - Proactive security plug 
A small note/plug: the schemes by Tim and Michael are based on `long lived'
secret sharing, i.e. you trust each share of your secret to a server for a
really long time. Some people may be concerned that such a long time would
allow an attacker to break into most servers and reconstruct the secret (key).
A solution to this is proactive secret sharing, as described in [HJKY95].
In this protocol, the secret shares are periodically refreshed (i.e. new
shares are computed distributively and then the old shares are erased).
In this manner, an attacker has to break into most servers during the same
period; shares from one period are worthless on the next period.

How do you know that?   :-)
