@_subject: Kevin Mitnick 
: Years ago I read a 'hacker-book' that had a long section about the
: activities of Mr Mitnick in the 80's ('Zero' something?). I no nothing
: of his present doings. Some questions:
: Is Mr Mitnick a dangerous selfish criminal egomaniac whom every good guy
: immediately should turn over to the FBI if identified?
Basically, yes. Hes a petty and
vindictive hacker who does real
damage, and goes out of his way to
fuck over people he perceives
have done him wrong. If you do
turn him in, do it anonymously.
This guy is bad news. I say that
from first-hand experience.
By the way although hes on the
lam at the moment, hes still hacking
vaxen across the world.  And some
of these vaxen have spotted him and
called the FBI.  I wonder when he'll
find out :-)
