I second the motion for Loompanics and Paladin Press.  Two books
that might be directly related, both from Paladin Press and both
by Lawrence W. Myers are "SPYCOMM: Covert Communication Techniques
of the Underground" and "Improvised Radio Jamming Techniques: Electronic
Guerrilla Warfare." Both are full of practical, "nuts and bolts"
discussions of the issues you're pursuing.

However you may feel personally about Mr. Gritz (and his connection
to Ross Perot, etc), I think he serves at least three useful purposes
for other members of society who might be labelled "loose cannons",
to wit:
1)  When the Sierra Club was working for their particular agenda in the
    early seventies, many in the "mainstream" dismissed them as whackos
    on the extreme edge.  Later, when Earth First came along and
    redefined what the environmental movement could become, suddenly
    the Sierra Club was a reasonable, legitimate voice with which those
    in authority could reason.  Mr. Gritz, IMHO, is in part helping to
    redefine the "envelope" of so-called patriotism.  His extreme measures
    may serve to help legitimize less unusual actions which are now
    considered "out there."
2)  He serves as a lightning rod for government enforcement.  It is often
    in the best interests of those in power not to drawn the line of
    acceptable/not acceptable behavior (keep 'em guessing).  His actions
    (and those of Randy Weaver, David Koresh, etc) all drawn attention
    to the willingness of the government to "do something."  It then
    becomes more possible to predict the actions of certain government
    agencies.
3)  It keeps said agencies busy.  Contrary to popular opinion, the
    resources of the government are not infinite (it only seems that
    way).  The government is more like a few dozen lumbering Goliaths,
    each stumbling after whichever David is most irritating at the moment.
    Mr. Gritz serves as the decoy to lure certain giants away from
    other activites.  Federal agents and other resources devoted to
    gathering intelligence on Mr. Gritz are no longer available to
    gather intelligence on others.  [This resource allocation problem,
    IMHO, is one the main reasons for the FBI's insistence on the
    Digital Telephony Bill -- it allows a far greater degree of
    "intelligence" gathered per expenditure of resource.]
Nutty or not, I'll be happy to cheer on Mr. Gritz.

This appears to be an appropriate point for me to extend an offer
to scan any cypherpunk material for this list and/or achives that may
be appropriate. I have a Hewlett-Packard ScanJet IIcx with the
Automatic Document Feeder attachment, and Caere's OmniPro OCR software,
as well as Microsoft Office and WordPerfect 6.0.

I am also planning on attending DefCon, and would be interested in meeting
up with some Cypherpunks.

This is *not* how crash victim identification is done.  The FAR requirement
is only that passengers be _seated_ during takeoff and landing, not that
they be seated "where they're supposed to be."
In fact, many airlines do not assign seats at all.  First come first serve
for airlines like Southwest, ValuJet, Western Pacific, etc.
Actual victim identification varies from mundane (do they have a wallet
on their person, etc.) to rather more gristly methods.
Don't be sorry.

@_subject: DC Cypherpunks meeting report 
The DC Cypherpunks held their monthly meeting on April 13 at the Digex
offices, with about a dozen people attending.  The agenda was light,
with discussion ranging from ISDN in Virginia and Maryland, a security
hole in rlogin, various biometric identification methods and Dorothy
Denning's GPS ID plan.  Carl Ellison gave an overview of Cybercash, and
answered several questions.
  After the meeting, a smaller group adjourned to a local Chinese
restaurant, where most of the discussion focused on getting inexpensive
ISDN or IP connectivity between Baltimore and northern Virigina.
  No meeting date was set for May.
