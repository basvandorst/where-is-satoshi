@_subject: Distributed Key Breaking 
Just as a quick thought - given the prevelance of Web Browsers - has anyone considered writing a Java Applet that would could run key space searches and factoring in an easily distributed manner.
This would seem to be a 'reasonable' way to gain access to more CPU power - even though the Java code would not be as efficient as a native app. Perhaps as a supplement to the more 'traditional' methods that have been used in the past.
