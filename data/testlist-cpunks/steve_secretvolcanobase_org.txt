Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, the free and democratic world has aircraft carriers, tanks and cruise missiles. It also has the ability to turn off bits of the Internet at will. The only way bitcoin would threaten it is if it was really really not paying attention.

This is just nonsense. The political elite can easily rely on their footsoldiers to enforce the law, and the law is what they say it is. They're wise enough to praise the armed forces frequently and raise enough budget to ensure their well-being as to keep them as an effective force for repressing the masses. Only when a concept has sufficient popular support that the masses strength of numbers becomes embarrassing will the military not obey the elite. Look at Occupy, they didn't even have to break out the military for that one. Now consider the massive support bicoin has; oh wait, it's almost non-existent in comparison.

Sure the question is whether or not you agree with the conviction? It is possible, theoretically at least, for a corporation to be convicted under a law that is later decided to be unjust.
