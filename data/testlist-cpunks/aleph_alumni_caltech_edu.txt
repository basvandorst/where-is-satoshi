That's not mainstream media.  That's a computer industry rumor site that's
wrong most of the time.  Besides, the founder just got fired and started a
new site, so what few viewers they had got disgusted and left.  It used to
be funny without stelaing from others.                               -Colin

Microsoft won because of superior reviews? Come on, how stupid do you think we are?  So if a company pays for glowing reviews that would be okay?  Obviously they have never tried to sell a product.  It's very dificult to get consideration such that you could prove the technical merits when there is a large existing supplier.  It's much worse when the client knows that that supplier has a long history of targetting 'upstart' companies and destroying them.  Support and upgradeability are important features that require a company to continue operating.  I'll admit that the trial was fucked up from the start by the decision to center it around netscape rather than something more blatant like stac.  Anyways, this has nothing to do with FC, unless you think that enterprise is fundamentally expressive and Microsoft's vicious suppression of competition has limited the ability of others to be heard.

Hmm.  This made me think of something blatantly obvious that I had overlooked before.  Copyrights are authorized in the main body of the Constitution, but the first ammendment clearly overrides that, so all laws implementing copyright are just as unconstitutional as laws implementing prohibition, and have been for significantly longer.  Beer and Bootlegs!

So you admit then, that the material in question has no basis whatsoever on anything that could be considered by anyone to be "science" and is in effect merely a bottle of Doc Theroux's patent "free-market medicine", guaranteed to cure what ails you.  Because he says so.  Just don't come back tomorrow, 'cause he'll have moved on to the next town by then.

Somewhere in all this discussion of network effects, the very name has
somehow been obscured.  My god, these are "network" effects!  Of course
they will be more pronounced on an actual network.  than a
give up

Well here is another moron.  From Jerry Fallwell's statements, and Pat Robertsons concurrence, I think it is pretty safe to say that we are in just as much danger from christain fundamentalist terrorists as from muslim fundamentalist terrorists.  I fail to see what a conversion would accomplish.  Let alone a forced conversion.  Blech.  Just when I'm feeling proud to be an American, watching the wonderful response of the people in New York, these scum come along and make me ashamed to be an American.

And yet many Americans do follow them and respect them.  That is what disgusts me.
