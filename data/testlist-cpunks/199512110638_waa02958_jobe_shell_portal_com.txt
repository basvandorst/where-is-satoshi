I've just released details of an attack many of you will find interesting since quite a few existing cryptography products and systems are potentially at risk.  The general idea of the attack is
that secret keys can be found by measuring the amount of time used to
to process messages.  The paper describes attacks against RSA, fixed-
exponent Diffie-Hellman, and DSS, and the techniques can work with many other systems as well. My research on the subject is still in progress and the current paper does not include many of my findings.  I will eventually publish a full paper, but am releasing a preliminary draft now to alert the community as quickly as possible.  A copy of the abstract is attached at the end of this message and the full text can be downloaded in PostScript format from:
  ftp://ftp.cryptography.com/pub/kocher_timing_attack.ps
  ftp://ftp.cryptography.com/pub/kocher_timing_attack.ps.gz
I've also made an HTML version which is accessible at:
  (The HTML uses subscripts and superscripts which aren't supported in older web browsers.  The PostScript version is the "official" one and looks nicer.)
The results have already been seen by Matt Blaze, Martin Hellman, Ron Rivest, Bruce Schneier, and many others.  While the full significance
of the attack is not yet known, I think everyone who has seen it considers it important (including Netscape who awarded me a $1000 bugs bounty prize).     ABSTRACT.  Cryptosystems often take slightly different     amounts of time to process different messages. With network-
    based cryptosystems, cryptographic tokens, and many other     applications, attackers can measure the amount of time used     to complete cryptographic operations.  This abstract shows     that timing channels can, and often do, leak key material.      The attacks are particularly alarming because they often     require only known ciphertext, work even if timing     measurements are somewhat inaccurate, are computationally     easy, and are difficult to detect.  This preliminary draft     outlines attacks that can find secret exponents in Diffie-
    Hellman key exchange, factor RSA keys, and find DSS secret     parameters.  Other symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic     functions are also at risk. A complete description of the     attack will be presented in a full paper, to be released     later. I conclude by noting that closing timing channels     is often more difficult than might be expected. Paul Kocher

I just saw a small article with your name on page 1 of the N.Y. Times Fax 8-page Internet Edition. (Monday, December 11, 1995)
They change the edition at about 10:30-11 P.M. Eastern Standard Time (0330-0400 the next GMT day) so if you read this before then, you might want to download It is in Adobe Acrobat format.
Of course, there is probably a larger article in the paper edition.

In case you don't already know, there is an article about your work in Monday's N.Y. Times. I just read a very small version of it in  (Adobe Acrobat-format 8-page edition)
The N.Y. Times Fax on the web changes edition about 10:30 or 11 P.M. New York time so if you want it, get it before then.
