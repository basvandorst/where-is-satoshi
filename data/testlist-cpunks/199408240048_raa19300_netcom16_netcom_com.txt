Huh?  Nonsense?
vie: - use PGP to sign & encrypt
vis: - use PGP to sign
Both of these sign or sign/encrypt outgoing messages automatically if you're using "elm" - just use them in place of your favorite editor.
pgpview does the same thing for incoming email.  Use it in place of your mail viewer in elm.
