@_subject: [liberationtech] Google Bows Down To Chinese Government On 
[not directed at Maxim, just a general thought on this topic]
Rushes to judge Google about its handling of China should probably be
tempered by the knowledge what the Chinese government really wants is to
push local companies like Baidu.  The government's protectionist policy
for Chinese web & technology companies just happens to mesh nicely with
their censorship policy in this case.
So if Google pushes too hard, the overall result will just be to give
more market share to Baidu, which doesn't really help the cause of
freedom for Chinese Internet users either.
Google's executives understand this very well.  There's a good argument
to be made that the things they could do to look brave and principled
are not the things that would actually help information freedom in China
in the long run.
Please note that I'm not making a "shades of gray" point, just a
"complexity" point.
