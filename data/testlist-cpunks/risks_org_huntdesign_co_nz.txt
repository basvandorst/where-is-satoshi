@_subject: Hospital generator failure following earthquake 
A report in the Lancet by Michael Ardagh et al. describes the initial
health-system response to the earthquake in Christchurch, New Zealand, in
February 2011, with a focus on the Christchurch Hospital emergency
department.  While the response is assessed as effective, the report notes
"Power was lost immediately.  Within seconds, six diesel-fueled generators
activated to provide power to electrical outlets designated as essential
services.  However, the severe shaking disturbed sump sludge within the
diesel tanks.  Consequently during subsequent hours, a generator failed
several times, leaving the emergency department clinical areas, ICU, blood
bank, radiology department, and other areas with no power."
Under Lessons learned, the report states, "The back-up generator diesel
tanks have since been drained and cleaned."
