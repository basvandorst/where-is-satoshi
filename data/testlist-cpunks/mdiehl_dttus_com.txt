OTOH, maybe we _should_ try for constant computation time and then try      for *random* delay time.  Remember that _we_ will spend a lot of real      time arguing whether the *random* delay is really _random_

     Hey, don't go for constant time, that's too hard to get perfect.  Add      a *random* delay.  This particular crypto-flaw is pretty easy to fix.      (See, I'm not *always* arguing the downside of cryptography!)
     It is worth noting, however, the extent to which "secure"      cryptographic protocols keep needing to get fixed one last time....       -- Nathaniel --------

     This is what I think about setting up an additional list:
     1. If I subscribe to both lists, it won't change my eMail traffic
     2. If the "news, NOISE, off-topic" posts are sent to both lists, my      eMail volume will increase
     3. The cypherpunks subscribers are not the problem
     4. What Adam and Perry (and others) want is that the "news, NOISE,      off-topic" posters change their behavior and not post long news items      verbatim.
     5. How are you going to get those posters to agree to change?
     My vote, for what it's worth, is don't split the list.  It won't work      because the extra posts ARE going to go to this list because that's      where they believe their readers are.

@_subject: Using deterministic programs to select private RSA keys. 
Much has been said recently here about how to produce truly random      primes.
     [snip]
     The protocol is to accept a sequence of key strokes for printable      ASCII characters.
     [snip]
     I suggest that if you capture the time in microseconds between      keystrokes and insert the least significant 8 bits between the      corresponding characters (i. e.     ...  ) and MD5 the set of values, the resulting "random" value      will be different for both people who type different input texts as      well as those people who type the same input text.
     It is important to be sure that you are accessing a true microsecond      clock (or other high resolution clock).  For example, in the IBM PC      architecture, the clock tic (basic time interrupt) is one per 18.2      milliseconds or 55 interrupts per second.  If you were using the clock      tic rate and a highly trained typist with a regular typing rate, the      interspersed time values might show a consistent set of values.  On      the other hand, use of a microsecond clock eliminates this problem.
     As regards the observation that MD5 produces only a 128 bit result,      you could call MD5 after each nn values (at least 16) have been      entered.  In that way a few lines of input and associated timing      values could easily generate a value of the same order of magnitude as      the number  of 1K primes.

     He might be talking about the (already fixed) bug that allowed an HREF      that is longer than 356 bytes to overwrite the stack.  Hadn't heard      here that anything would happen other than getting Netscape to crash.       No names or URL's were given in the story.  Maybe he needs an update.

     ...
     Two important observations about the use of a disk drive to get      randomness:
     1. In the case of some workstations, the local network provides the      disk drive and there isn't a local hard drive at all.  Hence, any      timing of disk accesses will give you data that is influenced by the      file server more than the disk drive.
     2. When doing time domain measurements (Hewlett Packard had some good      application notes on this subject), you must consider base clock      jitter.  Ill try to illustrate with a diagram:
     actual event:            V                    V
     clock granularity:  /...../...../...../...../...../...../
     the problem is that no matter how small the basic clock unit is      (symbolized by "/", above), you can't be sure how much of that unit      has passed when the event (symbolized by "V", above) occurs.  For      example, on the original IBM PC, clock interrupts occurred about 18.2      times per second (55ms interval).  In that architecture, you can't      time an event and have an uncertainty of less than 2 times 55ms
     If you propose using a special hardware random generator, you have a      different set of problems:
     1. You need to buy and install hardware on many different platforms --      you don't always have access to do that.
     2. Many earlier posts on this subject pointed out that removing bias      was important.  In that case, you need to continuously test and      recertify the hardware random generator for randomness.  In order to      do that, you need to have so much knowledge about generating and      testing random numbers in software that you might as well use a      software solution in the first place.
     Good luck

IMO, it's simpler than that:  suppose your favorite rater (SafeForChildren, SafeForCongressCritters, SafeForChurch, ...) has a PGP-style key.  If they rate a page as OK for their subscribers to read, the rater signs the page with it's private key and requests the page owner to include that signature on the page.  If you want to limit what you read to what they approve, you read only those pages whose signatures can be verified with the trusted rater's public key.  BTW, you could put the signature verification into the WEB browser rather than the proxy and keep the overhead out in the user's PC.
Would need extensions to HTML standards; e. g. .  This would be the hash over the entire page _excluding_
the "rated_by portion(s) so that multiple raters could exist and interoperate.
Martin G. Diehl
Just my own opinion.

I agree, if you're going to bother with rating pages, digitally signing the signature so that terrorist X can't just copy the "Good Clean Fun" rating code into his Phosgene formula page is the only rational solution.
Gotta love that overhead, though.

WSJ - 2/20/96, page B1      "Click! Doctor to Post Patient Files on Net" by G. Bruce Knecht
     "An audacious experiment ...
     [snip]
     "Deep in the heart of Appalachian coal country, a doctor is about to      put his patients' records on the World Wide Web.  The Doctor, Bruce      Merkin, works at a community health clinic in Wayne, W. Va."
     [snip]
     "Dr. Merkin and Vasudevan Jagan-nathaniel, a West Virginia University      professor who is responsible for developing the software for the      system, say they have yet to decide how secure the system should be.       At one extreme, they could encrypt the information, offering the      highest possible degree of protection.  But encryption is expensive      and time consuming and thus could hinder the goals of cutting costs      and rapidly transmitting information."
     [snip]
     Cypherpunks:
     The WSJ report seems to indicate that the system is to be deployed      without any encryption safeguards.
     After talking by phone to Lee Oxley (oxley at vhs.wvu.edu) at Valley      Health in Wayne, WV, I got clarifications of what was in the WSJ      story.  The present pilot system is an intranet system with dedicated      frame relay links and does use encryption.  Eventually they may deploy      a system that would be internet based.  They are considering how much      protection to put into the system.  The reference in the article about      encryption costs was intended to be about CPU cycles not dollars.      Vasudevan Jagan-nathaniel's email address is juggy at cerc.wvu.edu
     Some obvious proposals would be to use something like SSL to do server      to workstation encryption.  I don't know what issues may exist such as      the effort to install SSL, key management, and processing delays due      to session keys and traffic encryption.  In addition, how could an      on-call doctor access patient records through an ISP and maintain      patient privacy.  An obvious issue (which I know have been discussed      on this list) has to do with the trade-off between key size and      privacy.
     Any other thoughts?
