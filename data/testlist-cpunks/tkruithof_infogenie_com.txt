Genuine Swiss made Rolex replicas are as close to the real thing as a replica watch can be. Sometimes even the professional jewelers are unable to tell the difference from the real Rolex watch.  All genuine Swiss Rolex Replicas should have the following:- Full 1-year Warranty   - Solid 14k or 18k Gold on two-toned models
  - Guaranteed triple-wrapped gold on all-gold models   - Genuine sapphire crystal - a type of glass that is many times better   at resisting scratches than regular glass.
  - The color of the gold looks exactly like a genuine Rolex watch If the retailer does not offer this, do not purchase from them!//e have all this! JUST   COME and buy your REPLICA //atches!
