Whoa...  why not???  PGP 2.4 output is identical to 2.3a!
Is PGP 2.5 somehow incompatible with 2.3a?
Besides, if you take a PGP 2.3 key and change the version number to 2.4,
the software can't tell the difference... Let's not play stupid games. Either it's compatible with 2.3 AND 2.4 or it isn't.
Anyway, PGP 2.5 is news to me... Does it have any new features?  Limitations?
