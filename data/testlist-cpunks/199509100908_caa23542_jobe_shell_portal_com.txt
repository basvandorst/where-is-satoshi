@_subject: PGP in UK 
I heard something rather disturbing the other day from someone I do
business with.  I've been telling this company for 18 months or so
about the advantages of PGP and email rather than faxes, and they
finally tried it, liked it, and decided to use it a month or so ago.
Last week they got a visit from the Department of Trade of Industry
and MI5 (or is it MI6?) telling them to stop using PGP or they might
find difficulties getting export licences for their products in
future.  The visitors wouldn't say how they knew this company had
been using it.
The person who told me about this also said something about a
Department of Trade & Industry paper which mentioned that the British
Government was going to insist on key escrow for encryption.  I had
hoped to get a copy of this, but he can't find it at the moment.
I'll post the text when I get it if anyone's interested.
Anyone else in the UK heard anything about this?
