If they know you're trying to shake them, that alerts them and
eliminates any opportunity you might have otherwise had to feed them
misinformation in the future.
Or, depending on the potential threat you represent, they might just
arrest you and put you in a dark hole since you're obviously no longer a
useful source of intel.
