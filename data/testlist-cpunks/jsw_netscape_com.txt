Sorry Rich, you must be mistaken.  All of the beta 3 entries had

This problem was found a few weeks ago and we fixed it immediately.
You all can see the fix in Beta 3, which does not reflect the
history strings into livescript.  As soon as I heard of the problem
I insisted that it be fixed right away.  I also had a fairly extensive
discussion with the creator of livescript about what other things
might be dangerous.  We didn't come up with anything, but will be
doing a security review of livescript before the final 2.0 release
just to make sure.

If the government wants to purchase software for its own use that implements
key escrow, why it that bad?  The whole point of our anti-GAK position is that
government mandated key escrow is bad.  If individuals, companies, or government
agencies want to escrow their own keys, with the escrow agents of their own
choosing, I have not problem.  Its only when the government make the escrow
and the agent mandatory that I've got a problem.
  I don't believe that Netscape will ship a product that mandates GAK
unless it was required by law to do so.  As long as it is legal to sell
non-escrowed crypto products in this country or elsewhere, I think we
will keep doing it, because that is what our customers want.

After talking with Jim over lunch, I believe that the second interpretation

point.  Also keep in mind that Jim's comments are his own opinion, and do
not necessarily represent the position of the company.  Barksdale's law is
that we provide value to our customers.  Our customers want long keys an
no GAK, both within and outside the country.  As long as we are legally
allowed to do that, I think we will.  The fact that customers know the
dangers of 40-bit keys, and that it is the government that is forcing
them to use weak keys, is in large part due to the brute force cracks
of the cypherpunks.

If the law requires GAK, then I believe that we will implement it rather
than just disable encryption.  We are taking a position against GAK and
will continue to lobby against it.  We are planning to continue to do both
US and Export versions, so I don't think that the government's ploy of
trying to lure companies into weakening their domestic versions will work.
We released a 128-bit version of our product almost a year ago, at a
time when many companies were providing only weak crypto in their domestic
products so that they didn't have to trouble themselves with two versions.
We are actively lobbying in washington to get clarification of the
current regulations so that we can provide the US version via an "export
controlled" FTP or HTTP download.

I had lunch with Jim Clark today, and explained the furor that was
currently going on in cypherpunks and elsewhere.  After lunch he sent
me the e-mail that I've attached below to pass along.  I think the gist
of it is that if governments require key escrow, we will have to do it
in order to sell our products with encryption into those countries.
  We've actively lobbied against the government's proposal through
our participation and support of industry efforts by the ITAA, BSA,
SPA and others.  Next week we will be sending two representatives
to the NIST key escrow conference in DC.  In preparation for that
meeting we have been formulating an official company position on
key escrow and export restrictions.  Phil, myself, and other folks with
cypherpunk leanings are involved in writing the policy statement.
We are planning on taking a firm position against the government's
key escrow proposals.  Some time next week we will be posting our
statement publicly, and will welcome your comments on it then.
  After the NIST meeting we will also be talking to folks in congress
and the white house about our position, looking for help in getting the
current export limitations removed.  We will also be looking for
help in getting the government's position on export controlled FTP
sites clarified so that we can make the US version of the Navigator
with 128-bit crypto available for download by those people who are
legally allowed to use it.
  We don't have any plans to stop doing separate US and export
versions of our software.  As long as our customers want strong
crypto and the government lets us sell it, I think we will keep
doing it.

Can't I be a supporter of strong crypto, and also be in it for the money?
Many people here make good money off of crypto related work.  If I'm asked
to implement GAK in a situation where it is not mandated by law, I won't
do it.
  Tim was referring to the position statement against GAK that we will be
releasing before the NIST meeting next week.
  What I meant, and have said in other places, is that if it is legal to
ship a product without GAK for use inside the US, or anywhere else,
I believe we will do it, because that is what our customers want.
  I'm sorry my dig at the ITAR does not ammuse you.  Your suggested
replacement would not be appropriate since I don't support GAK (I believe
that it is one of the most evil things any government could do to its
citizens), and I'm not in marketing.

I wasn't aware that you were privy to the details of the contract.
  We are asking for both.  We want to know what we have to do to make
our US version available for FTP download to everyone who is legally
allowed to use it, without violating the current law.  We also want
the export restrictions removed so that we can ship the same stuff
to other countries.  The former is a short term goal while the
latter will likely turn into a longer term effort.
  So you consider not breaking the law to be "rolling over"?  You have
the luxury of hiding behind anonymity.  We don't.
  Doesn't everyone want to know this?  Do you think that the ITAR is clear
about the meaning of "export" in the case of FTP and the internet?
  Four months ago we did not have lots of money in the bank.  People seem
to forget that this still a young and small company.  Perhaps the current

This report is mostly bogus.  Netscape does not, and never

we do cache documents from servers that use http auth.
In this case the user had their preferences set to check the
host site for updated content "once per session".  There is
a bug, which we are fixing before 2.0 ships, that if the
auth fails the document should be removed from the cache but
was not. If the user had set their cache checking to "never",
then if the document is in the cache, it will always be shown to
the user, since no connection is made to the server.
  Content providers who don't want their web pages cached
should use the 'Pragma: no-cache' http header.  This will
tell the navigator to not save the document in the disk cache.

  Why do you believe that Netscape has been chosen by the
government to bring GAK to the masses?  Because of the
uninformed and misguided comments of Jim Clark?  Jim has been
educated and the company has taken a firm position against
government control of crypto.  When you go to the store today

The second and third sets of checksums were generated using the two
forms of the unix 'sum' command.  The 'sum' command creates a 16-bit
checksum, which can be used detect accidental corruption during download,
but is too small to protect you from malicious tampering.

unix vendors follow two different standards.  I have labeled the
checksums with the systems that they are good for.  If you are performing
the checksum operation on a unix system that is not listed, check both
lists and make sure that one matches.  Note that some Sun systems have
both versions of the sum command, so the results you get will depend

I would guess that they are choosing to be cautious so that if their
patent is rejected they can still maintain it as a trade secret.

Some RC4 keys that begin with specific values make it somewhat easier to
guess the first few bytes of the encrypted data.  This is a (probably
minor) weakness of RC4, and is in no way specific to Netscape.

@_subject: Netscape rewards are an insult 
The version of Java in Netscape is not compatible with the version of
Java in the summer release of HotJava.  There were incompatible changes
made by Sun between their alpha(summer HotJava) and beta (Netscape 2.0
and Sun's JDK Beta).  As I understand the situation, applets that were
written for HotJava must be ported to the beta API for them to work
with more recent releases of Java.
  I would agree that Java is not as stable as the rest of the 2.0 release.
That is one reason why we have added a preference to disable Java.
If you are worried about it you can just switch it off.  I argued for
this switch because I knew that there would be people who would not
want to trust Java until it had some mileage on it.
  The early beta releases we do are mostly intended for developers and
early adopters who want early access to the new features.  We had a
great leap in quality between B1 and B2, and I expect that to continue
with the future betas.

All of these security measures are implemented by Netscape in the
current release.  Specifically, Netscape Navigator 2.0beta2
includes all the applet security precautions detailed in the recent
comp.lang.java posting.  Netscape has been shipping the fixed
applet security model for over a month(since 2.0Beta1), and
Netscape and Sun continue to cooperate and work closely on applet
security issues.

I thought that they had not yet released their official policy.  Last
time I heard they were still refusing to put anything in writing saying
that your measures were "ok", pending release of their official policy.

Do you have a legal opinion to support this statement?  Our lawyers
tell us that executives of netscape could go to jail if we make the
128bit version of netscape available from an "export controlled"
ftp or http server.  We are working to clarify the situation with
the government or figure out an alternative distribution scheme that
will remove us from the grey area.
  Getting the US version of netscape widely available is one of my
highest priorities, but I can't tell Barksdale that he should go to
jail over it.  I'm constantly pushing from within the company to keep
things moving forward.
  In the mean time I appologize to the linux users who can't even
buy the 128 bit version.  If something changes on this front I'll
be sure to let people know.

@_subject: Netscape gives in to key escrow 
Please don't give up on us yet.  All press accounts I've read so far
have lots of stuff attributed to Jim, but very little of it is actual
quotes.  There appears to be lots of paraphrasing and interpretation
being done on the part of the reporters.  The impression that I'm
getting is that the press has blown a couple of small sound bites
way out of proportion.  The infoworld article that covers the same
speech only devotes about 20% of the article to the key escrow topic,
and is similarly devoid of actual quotes.
  I have not spoken to Jim about this, and I did not hear the talk
myself, so I'm mostly reading between the lines here.  After I saw the
story earlier today I started asking around to see if the company
had made any major policy shift in the direction of GAK, and wasn't
able to turn up anything.  If anything its the opposite.
  My feelings about key escrow, which were echo'd by several folks
in management when I spoke to them today are:
  I don't want to go down in history as a facilitator of the totalitarian
state, and I don't think anyone else here does either.  I hope folks
wait for press releases, product announcements, etc. before condemning us
too much.  Jim has made comments in the past that were quoted out of
context, and blown way out of proportion to the point that some people
believed that we were monitoring our user's every keystroke and sending
it all back to the home office to generate huge demographic databases.
I suspect that this is the same sort of thing, and I hope everyone will
judge us by what we do.

Yes, I get the idea about spewing the signed hashes everywhere.  The
problem I have is with the user of PGP.  That will help cypherpunks,
but does absolutely nothing for most of our millions of users, who

We are using MAXHOSTNAMELEN if it exists, both in 2.0, and in the
security patch that we shipped.  If it doesn't exist we just assume 64.
As a quick sample, on sunos and irix it is 64, and on solaris it is 256.
On sunos and irix it is defined in sys/param.h, and on solaris it is
defined in netdb.h.  I wasn't able to find any mention of it or any
other limits on the host names passed in to gethostbyname() in the
man pages on any of these systems.

Yes, we couldn't get to this type of stuff in the 1.12 patch.  We will be
doing this sort of stuff in 2.0.
  On unix you can use the csh(1) limit builtin to limit the size
of your netscape process.  As I understand it, the Mac also has
such a thing.  I'm not sure about windows.  Maybe we should put
a preference in Netscape for how much heap memory to use...

How about if the systems allows you to get a certificate that
has any name in it that you want, where the issuer makes no
claims about the identity of the owner of the certificate?
How about if the software lets the user decide which CAs they
will accept certificates from?  Given these two features,
would you still consider requiring a certificate to be bad?

@_subject: Certificate proposal 
I think the old idea of a certificate just binding a name and
a key is turning out to not be very useful.  That is why Netscape
Navigator 2.0 will support x509 version 3 certificates.  They allow
arbitrary attributes to be signed into a certificate.  In this new
world, you can think of a certificate as a way of binding a key with
various arbitrary attributes, one of which may be(but is not
required to be) a name.

@_subject: Certificate proposal 
It would be some value that would allow the credit card
authorization agency to match it up with the submitted credit
card number.  In the case of MasterCard's SEPP they are using
a salted hash of the Account Number, where the salt value is
unique per account, is secret, and is shared between the
bank and the card holder.

@_date: 1995-10-06 00:04:44
@_author: Jeff Weinstein 
@_subject: Certificate proposal 
The hash of just the card number isn't good enough.  If you collected
a bunch of certificates (they are public) then you could start guessing
valid card numbers and trying to match the hashes with your database.
The Mastercard SEPP proposal uses a salted hash, where the salt is
a shared secret between the bank and the user.

@_author: Jeff Weinstein 
@_subject: Certificate proposal 
I don't think that we need to get rid of names entirely.  It all
depends on the intended use.  In this case it would be reasonable
for the certificate to have the name in it.  It would also probably
be signed by a bank or card association CA, which was set up
specificly to sign merchant certificates.

@_subject: Certificates, Attributes, Web of Trust 
If you take a look at verisign's home page, they will be offering
"low assurance" certificates for free for non-commercial uses.  The
only thing they will guarantee about these certs is that the subject
name in the certificate is unique across all certificates signed
by their class I CA.  You should be able to get one of these
certs in real time via an HTML form.
  Anyone is free to set up a CA.  In Netscape Navigator 2.0 the
user can decide which CAs they want to accept certs from, or just
mark individual certs as "trusted" no matter what CA they were
signed by.  If you the user choose to trust a CA run by the Mob,
then thats your business.
  I assume that by "null certification" you mean self-signed
certificate.  As I said above, the user can choose to accept
any certificate they want, independent of who signed it.  If you
tell netscape that you want to accept "joe's" certificate for
the purposes of encrypted e-mail, then we don't care who signed

The second and third sets of checksums were generated using the two

checksum, which can be used detect accidental corruption during download,
but is too small to protect you from malicious tampering.

It is a fact of life now that there are many journalists
lurking on cypherpunks, and other places on the net.  I have
been directly contacted by three reporters just in the past
week.  Our PR department tells me that cypherpunks, and my
name, are routinely mentioned by reporters these days.  I've
seen my postings to this list quoted without my prior knowlege
in at least one news article.
  I wish that folks sending to this list would realize this
new world exists, as much as it sucks, and spend a bit more time
double checking before posting anything alarmist.  In particular,
there have been several recent false alarms regarding netscape
security sent to this list and others.  While I don't want to sweep
real security holes under the rug, I think it hurts both cypherpunk
and netscape interests for false claims to be coming out of this

  I think everyone agrees that if you don't check the bits you

few reporters are running around yelling at the top of your lungs
that internet commerce is totally doomed because it is possible for
users to infect their systems with viruses.  In the case of
Netscape, users who are worried about their binary being infected
during downloading could actually buy the product, either in their

  Here is a quote from Microsoft's Internet Explorer 2.0 Beta announcement,
which can be found at     Internet Explorer 2.0 also provides users with a secure environment.
    Complete support for Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and RSA encryption
    allows integration with secure sites. In addition, Internet
    Explorer 2.0 will support Private Communication Technology (PCT),
    which is an efficient and secure upgrade to the SSL protocol.
    Internet Explorer will also support Secure Transaction Technology
    (STT), an electronic payment technology jointly developed by
    Microsoft and Visa International, as soon as it is available.   There is that pesky word "secure", five times in one paragraph.
  What if they replace your "integrity shell"?
  We are working on clarifying our security claims.  Here is an
example from the San Jose Mercury news on Aug. 17, 1995:
    "We have said for a long time that given the right amount of
    computer power, that a 40-bit key encrypted message could be
    decrypted," said Mike Homer, Netscape's vice president of marketing.   Here is one definition of the word "security" from the Webster's
New World Dictionary, Third Edition:
    protection or defense against attack, espionage, etc.
  Note that I make no claims that this is Netscape's definition of
security in our products.
  Billions of dollars have not been invested in Netscape.  An examination
of the prospectus and the current stock price will bear this out.
  Here is a quote from the Netscape prospectus:
    The Company has included in its products an implementation of the
    Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL"), a security protocol which operates in
    conjunction with encryption and authentication technology licensed
    from RSA Data Security, Inc. ("RSA").  Despite the existence of
    these technologies, the Company's products may be vulnerable to
    break-ins and similar disruptive problems caused by Internet users.
    Such computer break-ins and other disruptions would jeopardize the
    security of information stored in and transmitted through the
    computer systems of end users of the Company's products...
  Of course anyone who is interested in investing in Netscape's
stock should get and read the entire prospectus.
  It would have to be many billions of dollars before it becomes
"a fair chunk of the world economy", and I think that even the
most optimistic projections of internet commerce put that many
years in the future.
  I don't think that it is reasonable to expect that everyone who
asks for an official company position on some random mailing list
will get a response.  The people who make such statements are not
usually on such lists, and the have other forums for making public
statements.  Perhaps you should call our PR department for a statement.
  You are certainly free to "stand your ground", but I am also
free to not respond to you.

The issue is that any statement that only mentions the 1 minute figure
is only stating part of the story, just as a statement giving a figure
of several hours is only mentioning a part of the story.  All of the
news articles I've seen (not an exhaustive sample) have only mentioned
the 1 minute number, which only really effects a relatively small
number of our customers.
  If you don't know the pid and ppid, or the tick count in the case of
Mac/PC, you will have to add them to your search, which could make it
take much longer than 1 minute to crack.  If you assume that the unix
machine has been up for a while and has a decent turnover of processes
(not a valid assumption for determining strength) then you would have
to search on average half of 16 bit pid space, and then add a few bits
for the ppid(assuming that it is likely to be close to the pid).
  Even if you only got 8 extra bits from pid and ppid, that turns your
one minute attack into a several hour attack.   Anyway, I'm not trying to say that "several hours" is the only answer,
just that it is just as good an answer as "one minute".  As far as I
know, no one has tried this attack without knowing the pids.
  This is really dependent on how long window has been running.  If you
boot windows and immediately start an ssl connection, then the number
will be pretty low, but if you don't make the first SSL connection until
later, it should get better.  I think an hour would get you around 16-bits,
but this is just a guestimate on my part.  If you leave your machine
running windows for days you will get close to 32bits.

My view of SSL is that it should not generally be considered a transparent
layer that can be plugged in below any application.  I don't consider
HTTP on top of SSL to be the same as HTTP, or something that can totally
replace HTTP.  Thats why we use a different port and call it https: and not
http. I think using TELNET and FTP as examples of protocols that can be
transparently layered on top of SSL was unfortunate.  I've looked at
what it takes to make some existing protocols work with SSL, and I'm not
convinced that its always appropriate.  For example FTP and RCMD use
multiple connections, which is a royal pain.
  It seems that the thing you are objecting to is the wording in the
spec, in the "motivation" section, that appears to suggest that the
entire internet could run on top of SSL.  I think that section of the
spec could just be chopped out, and SSL would still be useful today
without pretentions of world domination.
  If a secure IP standard emerges that is widely deployed and provides
similar services, I don't see why SSL couldn't just go away (this is my
opinion, not an official position of netscape).
  This was sort of off the top of my head.  I've not spent long hours
contemplating these questions...

Here is the press release we put out this morning regarding the fix
for RNG seed and stack overflow problems.
BETA VERSIONS OF NETSCAPE SECURITY UPDATE TO BE AVAILABLE WEDNESDAY FOR
FREE DOWNLOADING
Company Puts New Code on Net for Examination;
Outside Security Experts Reviewing Software
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (September 25, 1995) -- Netscape Communications
Corporation (NASDAQ:  NSCP) today announced that it has completed beta
versions of the security update for its client and server software and will
post the new software for free downloading from the Internet on Wednesday,
September 27.  The beta versions of the software updates, being posted
following a review by internal and outside experts, are in response to the
potential vulnerability in the company's security implementation discovered
last weekend by two University of California at Berkeley students.  In
addition, Netscape is taking the opportunity to include other improvements
with this update.
Netscape addressed the potential vulnerability by increasing the amount of
random information it uses to seed the random number generator in its
security implementation.  In Netscape's security approach, the random
number generated is used in a mathematical formula to create a "session
key" for encrypting information to be sent across the Internet.  The new
solution uses many times more random information than the previous version,
ensuring much greater degrees of difficulty in identifying the key used to
encrypt a particular session.  The solution is also now assembled in a
platform-dependent manner which, when combined with the increase in random
information, makes Netscape's products substantially more secure than
before the update.
Netscape's source code that will be used to address the potential
vulnerability has already been posted on the Internet so that it can be
reviewed by anyone wishing to do so.  This technique is often used in the
development of security software to ensure the highest level of inspection
possible before the final software is made available to customers.  The
code is also being reviewed by external security experts retained by
Netscape and various Netscape platform partners with expertise in specific
operating system environments to provide additional checks on the soundness
of Netscape's approach.
"We have always encouraged users to provide feedback on new versions of our
software, and our posting of this security source code on the Internet is a
natural extension of that approach," said  Mike Homer, vice president of
marketing at Netscape.  "We plan to continue to use the Internet to test
new software versions, as we will shortly with the beta version of our
newly announced Netscape Navigator 2.0.  We expect that this kind of open
review will help us continue to create products of the highest quality."
Netscape is using the opportunity of this week's beta releases to also
update other portions of its software, addressing such issues as
domain-name limitations in international versions of Netscape Navigator�
and potential stack overflow conditions.  Netscape is also placing the beta
versions of the security updates for its Netscape servers on the Internet
for free download by customers.
"We process hundreds of customer orders daily using Netscape software.
Netscape's commitment to excellence as evidenced by the company's immediate
action in response to reported vulnerabilities is one of the many reasons
Internet Shopping Network has chosen Netscape products for conducting
Internet commerce," said Randy Adams, president of Internet Shopping
Network.  "We have built a multi-million dollar business on the Internet
using Netscape products and they are a major factor in our success."
The beta versions of the updated software -- Netscape Navigator 1.2.1b for
Windows, Netscape Navigator 1.1.1b for Macintosh and UNIX, Netscape
Commerce Server� 1.1.1b, and Netscape Proxy Server� 1.1.1b -- will be
available on Wednesday for downloading from Netscape's home page at
  All Netscape users are encouraged to download
the new versions as soon as possible to ensure they are using the most
up-to-date security software from Netscape.  Final versions of the updates

Rather than get into a big fight about how safe it is for netscape
to be reading PGPs randseed.bin file, I've changed our code to not
do it.  Instead of reading ~/.pgp/randseed.bin, we now get the name
of a file from the environment variable NSRANDFILE, and pass that
file's contents throught the RNG seed hash.  If you decide that its
safe, you can set the env variable to point to your randseed.bin file,
or any other file of random bits you care to use.

In case it is not clear from our previous postings, our patched

The release of Netscape Navigator that just started early beta, marketing
named "Atlas", has support for client certificates.  A spec detailing
how to interoperate with it, similar to the one I wrote on SSL 2 server
certificates, should be available before the final release of the product.
  The statement that "Netscape caches passwords" is not in itself true.
It is true that if the no-cache header is not present, AND the site
is using forms to enter passwords rather than HTTP auth, then the
form post data(including password) will be cached.  I've said here
before that this bug is being fixed in the next beta of the
upcoming release.  The default for SSL pages will be not to cache
at all.  If they used HTTP auth, their passwords would not
have gone into the cache.

@_subject: Flaw in Netscape rejoinder (was Re: FV Demonstrates Fatal Flaw in Software Encryption of Credit Cards) 
No problem.  This is how we find flaws and make systems stronger.
  A gigabyte drive has lots of corners to hide stuff.  A list of the
top 1000 first virtual sites would not be very large.  On a windows
system it could be hidden in the c:\windows\system directory, where
a 100k file with an unintelligible name would not seem unusual.
  You would not send the FV ID to the "bad guys" until you saw a complete
FV transaction take place.  You remember the ID when you see it, but
only send it after seeing the e-mail verification message.
  I guess I didn't explain this well enough.  The attacker would do
a single altavista query, and then broadcast it via some existing
mechanism over the net.  Weekly postings to some low volume junk
newsgroup would do the trick.
  So I only get half or a third of the millions of people conducting
commerce over the internet.  If this stuff ever really takes off that
will be plenty.
  It should be quite easy to determine what protocol a user uses to read
their mail from within winsock.  If we want to limit it to pop3 users, we
could just keep track of connections to port 110.  As noted before, if
they don't use pop we don't target them.
  With the explosive growth of internet connected PCs, I think that
the number of people who "surf" and read e-mail on different machines
is dwindling rapidly.  I am happy to skip those old guard of the
internet and concentrate on the newbies who only have one computer
and one account.
  Well this means that an attack against First Virtual would be more
  I still think that someone could construct an attack against the
current FV system using the techniques I've described.  It would be
more complicated to construct than the keyboard attack but that has
been proven time and again not to be a barrier.  Someone who could
construct the Morris worm or the year ago IP spoofing attacks could
do it.   I think that you may have to rethink some of your assumptions that
were valid back when you designed the system, but are no longer given
the current growth and changing demographics of the internet.
  I'd really like to see some effort spent on closing some of the more
gaping holes in the underlying systems.  Why should it be so easy
for one program to snoop on the keystrokes directed to another?
Why should it be so easy for a program downloaded from the net
to patch a part of the operating system?

First a disclaimer.  I have not studied the drafts of the protocol,

and I will try to answer to the best of my abilities.
  I don't know if the spec will specify SSL as the required transport, but
I think that our products will use it.
  RSA will be used in addition to DES (or perhaps something stronger).
  There is stuff in the protocol to prevent MITM and replay attacks.
I'm not familiar with the details, but I know that they have been
thinking about these problems for a long time.
  It is hard to get even the flavor of the protocol in a press release that
has been dumbed down for the general population.  I believe that the spec

able to convince marketing that they should back off.  I want it to
be clear what our product can and can not do.  For example, SSL can
only protect data in transit between two machines.  If either machine
is compromised then the data can be stolen at that end.  Our product
does not attempt to secure the user's machine, and can not operate
securely on an insecure machine.  Expect to see warnings and disclaimers

  If you are operating a server you can use a certificate signed by any

The snoop program is using FTP to find out the user's e-mail

was sending the user's e-mail address as the password for
anonymous FTP, which is the usually requested by FTP sites.
The perl script was waiting for the FTP to happen, and then
looking at its log to figure out the email address.
  I've removed the code that uses the e-mail address as the
FTP password for anonymous FTPs.  You can still enter it by
hand by using a URL of this form 'ftp://anonymous at ftp.netscape.com'.
This will cause the navigator to prompt the user for the password to send for anonymous.  This is a little known feature
that will also allow users to access non-anonymous ftp
accounts via netscape.

  One particularly interesting paragraph from the GNN article is:
  I believe that the reference to Netscape in this paragraph is
a distortion of our agreement with the NSA.  They agreed to
buy some of our current products, which they paid for, and to
buy products in the future that support Fortezza.  Given the
large number of organizations within the government that are
standardizing on fortezza, our motivation for producing such
a product should be obvious.  I think in the end the non-NSA
purchases of Fortezza based products within the government
will be much larger than what the NSA buys.
  Once we have implemented Fortezza we would like to add support
for many alternative crypto cards that are not GAK'd and are more
apropriate for commercial or personal use.  We will also continue
to offer software encryption.
  Management here has never asked me not to implement anonymity
enhancing features.  They have not asked me to implement DSS.
They have not asked me to implement GAK.  Management has

This is typical "the reporter doesn't understand the difference
between RSA and symetric cipher key sizes" reporting.  What it
really boils down to is that export software can use larger key
sizes for certain application specific encryption.  For example
if you limit what is being encrypted to fixed length financial
information such as credit card numbers and ammounts you can
use keys larger than 40 bits.

@_subject: Crippled Notes export encryption 
I can see two practical ways to build a netscape product outside
the US.  The first is to export the source code for the Navigator
with the crypto code removed.  All of the calls to crypto would
have to be removed as well.  I've heard some people claim that the
government could come after us on the grounds that we were taking
part in a conspiracy to export strong crypto.
  The other way would be to export a binary with pluggable crypto,
which is generally agreed to be regulated by the ITAR in the same
way as software that actually contains crypto.
  I suspect that to get around the US government in this way we
would have to develop the entire product outside of the US.  That
would be a very drastic move that is not likely to happen any
time soon.  We are going to invest some money and effort into
trying to get the current restrictions lifted first.
  Of course there are some of us who are ready and willing to go
if it comes to that...

As others have noted, they removed the calls to the crypto code.
  I don't think that the TLAs are concerned about people at
foreign universities using kerberos.  They are much more worried
about mass market products.  If we did the same thing as was done
for kerberos, then exported the code to a foreign subsidiary, I
believe that the government would try to make a case against us
that we had participated in a conspiracy to circumvent the
export restrictions.
  The government continues to use FUD to impose defacto restrictions
on what we can do.  When they decided not to prosecute PRZ they did
not clarify and said that they may decide at any time to go after
someone else.  They continue to try to wiggle out of stating a
clear, firm policy.  I think that our current efforts should be
geared towards pinning them down, then once we have specific
restrictions we can attack them.  The Phil Karn case is important
because it will help to clarify the ITAR restrictions.  Even Raph's RSA T-shirt CJR may help to clarify the restrictions into
something that we can really fight.

minimum response times for customer problems, compliance with an

@_subject: FV Demonstrates Fatal Flaw in Software Encryption of Credit Cards 
It would not be much harder than the demonstrated keyboard attack
to create a hacked version of winsock that would implement an
attack against First Virtual.  If the attacker had a list of web
pages that accept FV payments it would be very easy to collect
the ID numbers.  There is no need to attack the large datastream
of keyboard input when the search can be easily narrowed.  Since
FV doesn't use encryption the attack could easily be implemented
in winsock, making it independent of any client software.  A version
that infected the win95 IP stack could be quite effective.  The list
of FV accepting sites would be easily obtainable via a query of
altavista.  Since the infected system is on the internet and has
to periodically send its results to the attacker, it could download
an updated list of FV pages at the same time.    Attacking the e-mail verification step of the FV system could also
be accomplished via a hacked winsock.  A bit of POP3 aware code
in the winsock could intercept the verification messages and keep
the e-mail client from ever seeing them.  It could automatically
generate "Yes" responses for all such messages.
  I believe that FV is just as vulnerable to these types of
attacks as any of the encryption based credit card schemes, if
not more so.  The thing that really protects FV is that it can
only be used to buy bit, not real goods, and the bad guys don't
generally care about stealing bits.  This is also what makes FV
not generally useful to people who want to shop over the internet.

I don't like the fact that your proposal ties the size of the
bulk encryption key to the size of the public modulus.  There
are legitimate reasons why someone might choose to have a 512
bit modulus even though they prefer longer bulk encryption keys.
Your heuristic would be a good fallback in the absence of more
reliable information.    There is another method that does not require verisign or other
CAs to add key size extensions to their certs.  We can define
a new authenticated attribute that gets included in Signed-Data
and Signed-And-Enveloped-Data messages that indicates the
user's key size and algorithm preference.  This has the advantage
that the preference is selected and signed by the user.  This
method was discussed at the S/MIME meeting in January at the
RSA Crypto conference.  I'm a bit surprised that it never
got into the Implementation Guide.  I'll make sure that
we bring it up on the smime list again.
  What we finally implement will probably be a combination of
the three methods, with the user's selection taking precedence
over the CAs selection, which takes precedence over the
heuristic based on modulus size.
