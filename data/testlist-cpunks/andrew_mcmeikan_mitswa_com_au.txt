use on screen keyboards using mouse action or use non-bios routines that

If you need this level of security you probably need to look at the whole
environment and do some serious thinking.
If you use standard keyboards then the scancodes can be intercepted, if you
have standard PC's with non-custom OS then almost anything can be sniffed
out.  (The moot list is in need of any good advice on this, basic discussion
already covered)

It is probably hard for people in some countries to get their hands on
certain equipment and thus end up resorting to Spam.
A 'sting' operation would be one where the only response would be one that
confirmed guilt, I think these are just mis-directed pleas for help, when
they should be doing a little more research and approaching only those
that can help.
The paranoid side of me notes a certain similarity in style (has anyone
else received emails like these?)
