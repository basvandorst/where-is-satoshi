@_subject: Hassles taking App. Crypt. to Taiwan? (fwd) 
There will be no problem to bring it to Taiwan. I think you
     can buy a cheaper one at Taipei, but not as cheap as $2.25.
     Everything there is very expensive now, except books.
     Unfortunately, they are not rice-paper editions. You will have a
     hard time to eat them.
