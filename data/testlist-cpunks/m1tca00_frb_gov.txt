Re: copyrights, I have yet to hear Herr Sternlight say that pgp23a does
not have copyright problems.  He may not be asserting that as much,
but he has yet to recant.  It all started in a discussion about NAFTA,
GATT and patents.  Someone posted a passage from GATT about expansion
of copyrights (NOT patents).  He then used that post to assert that
pgp23a infringes in Europe.  When it was pointed out that the discussion
had been about patents, he asserted that pgp23a also violated copyrights
(I think he was just too embarrassed to admit confusing patents and
copyrights).  When I last asked him directly about why he thought pgp23a
violated, he used the fact that the pgp doc's referred to itself as
"contraband" as evidence.

CBS Liable for Filming Search
that a CBS film crew and Secret Service agents are liable for filming and
broadcasting a search of a private citizen's home. It is the first reported
court decision to hold a television broadcaster liable for accompanying
police agents on a search and filming it for the broadcast. Anyone who
has watched "Cops," "Hard Copy," "America's Most Wanted," or any
of the "real life" cop shows has seen the degrading and propagandistic
manner in which the victims of police repression are portrayed. The
broadcasters and the police can be sued and held liable for such
from a federal court authorizing the search of an apartment shared by
Babatunde Ayeni, his wife Tawa, and small son Kayode, seeking
evidence of a credit card fraud operation. At 6PM on March 5, 1992,
several Secret Service (SS) agents forced their way into the Ayeni
residence announcing they had a warrant to conduct a search and
ask questions. Only Mrs. Ayeni and her son were home at the time. At
about 8:15 four more SS agents arrived with a film crew from the CBS
news program "Street Stories." The CBS film crew was never identified
as CBS employees. The CBS crew followed the SS agents and taped
them as they searched the apartment. They took closeup shots of the
home's interior, its closets, personal letters, family photos, etc. In the
apartment's foyer an SS agent was interviewed about the modus
operandi of people who commit credit card frauds and the tools of
their trade. During this tape sequence the SS agent implied the
complicity of the other residents of the Ayeni apartment. No
evidence implicating the Ayenis in any illegal activity was found
during the search. One of the agents was filmed expressing his
contending that the search and its filming violated their fourth
amendment right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure. In his
opinion Judge Weinstein agreed with the Ayenis. The defendants sought
qualified immunity, which the court denied.
entitled to be free from liability for money damages even if they violate
constitutional rights as long as the right is not "well established" so that
a person of reasonable intelligence would know that the right violated
was recognized. In the case the court held that any reasonable police
agent would have known that it is unconstitutional to have private
citizens accompany them on a search to film and broadcast the search.
The court relied on 18 U.S.C. sec. 3105 which requires that search
warrants be served by an official authorized to serve the warrant and
by no other person unless their assistance is required in conducting the
search, i.e. an accountant, forensic expert, etc., depending on the
nature of the offense being investigated. Thus, the SS agents should
have known that having a film crew taping their activities was illegal.
Courts have previously held that taking photos is a "seizure" within
the meaning of the fourth amendment. CBS also claimed qualified
immunity from suit. The court notes that private entities are not
entitled to qualified immunity from suit, it only applies to government
the SS and CBS. "The search warrant was issued to agent Mottola and
other agents of the Unites States Secret Service for precise and limited
purposes. It authorized their entry into the Ayenis' home only to search
for items related to credit card fraud. Agent Mottola's act of facilitating
the CBS camera crew's entry into the apartment and its filming of the
search exceeded the scope of the warrant. It was allegedly in clear
violation then well [sic] established fourth amendment principles.
...it is the equivalent of a rogue policeman using his official position
to break into a home in order to steal objects for his own profit or
that of another."
for a government agent not to have known that the presence of
private persons he invited in so that they could titillate and entertain
others was beyond the scope of what was lawfully authorized by
the warrant.
home, to 'capture' the scene of the search on film and to remove
the photographic record. The images, though created by the camera,
are a part of the household; they could not be removed without
permission or official right....The television tape was a seizure of
private property, information, for non-governmental purposes."
of police and media activity may be able to halt the spread of
"police TV." Findings of liability against both police and the broadcaster
will see to it that police activity is not broadcast to "entertain and
titillate." So if you've been filmed against your will during a police
search you too can sue for an invasion of your privacy and your
fourth amendment rights. The court decision is reported at:
Ayeni v. CBS, Inc., 848 F. Supp 362 (ED NY 1994).

source: U.S. Army Private Faces Spying Charges
WASHINGTON (Reuter) - The U.S. Army said Wednesday it had charged a
20-year-old computer specialist with espionage and computer crimes in a
case that the soldier's parents said involved a Chinese national.
Pfc. Eric Jenott of the 50th Signal Battalion at Fort Bragg, North
Carolina, was formally charged June 28 and is in a Marine Corps jail in
Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, awaiting court-martial, the army said.
``The case involves classified information and matters pertaining to
national security,'' a three-paragraph statement from Fort Bragg, home
of the Army's 18th Airborne Corps, said. It said many of the case's
details were too sensitive to disclose.
Jenott has been charged with giving ``secret computer passwords relating
to the national defense'' to a Mr. Lee, ``a citizen of a foreign
nation,'' his lawyer said, reading from the charge sheet. He also faces
charges of destruction of government property and larceny.
The charge sheet alleged Jenott disclosed the passwords between April
and June ``with the intent or reason to believe it would be used to the
injury of the United States or to the advantage of a foreign nation.''
It said the passwords ``directly concerned communications
intelligence,'' among the most closely guarded U.S. secrets.
Jenott is facing a general court-martial, the most serious kind, and
a possible life sentence if convicted, his lawyer, Timothy Dunn, of
Fayetteville, North Carolina, said in a telephone interview.
He said his client was ``not a criminal'' but had broken into a
supposedly impenetrable system after advising his superiors of defects
in the security system. Dunn declined to discuss the system because
of what he called the case's sensitive nature and national security
John Jenott said his son, a fluent Chinese speaker whom he described as
a ``computer genius'' with a longstanding interest in China, had given a
young Chinese friend what the son described as an unclassified computer
He said his son knew the person to whom he gave the code from one
of several trips he had made to China. His son, ``not your average
kid-out-on-a-skateboard-type guy,'' could read and write Chinese and
lived with a Chinese family in Vancouver, Canada, for about a year when
he was in high school, the father added.
He said his son told him that before giving away the code, he had
been trying to show his superiors a security flaw in a sensitive
communication system and eventually demonstrated he could get secret
data without authorization.
``He was trying to say we have a weakness,'' John Jenott said in a
telephone interview from his home in Graham, Washington. ``This stuff
about being a spy -- it's ridiculous.'' His stepmother, Kelly Jenott,
said, ``They're blowing this way out of proportion.''
His father said an Army major at Fort Bragg, whom he declined to name,
had urged him to persuade his son to sign a confession, so prosecutors
would not seek the death penalty.
Jenott said his son had told him, ``Dad, I'd rather die than sign
``He said it's not true. He said, 'I'm not a spy. I didn't commit
espionage. And I'm not going to sign something that says I did,'''
Jenott said.

Well, my site just got ViaCrypt pgp version 4 (Personel Edition) and it was the first I'd heard of it.  None of my utilities that worked with the old ViaCrypt pgp 2.7.1 seem to work under version 4 (the script that checks signatures dies, as does the exmh interface which can no longer find my personal keys).
I assume that these are mostly due to changes in the command-line options, although I can find no list of what exactly has changed.
But my REAL question is will this version of pgp be compatible with the international versions?  If not, I'd just assume revert to pgp 2.6.2 from rgds-- TA  (tallard at frb.gov)

This will be my one and only post on the topic.  Let me first say that I support Gilmore's decision...
Dale Thorn  said:
I don't understand your argument here at all.  There are, in a libertarian society, no "positive" rights (that is to say, the government owes you nothing).  There are only "negative" rights (that is to say, there are things to gov't can not DO to you).
When the gov't talks about censoring the works of Maplethorpe or other "offensive" art, I think they have every right to do so since they (we) PAY for it.  The gov't does not owe artists the "right" to have their work created at the public's expense.  In a libertarian society, the gov't wouldn't subsidize speech or art in the first place.  If they want to pay for it themselves, the gov't can not restrict them.  They can't force me to pay for it.  And no one can force Gilmore to let Vulis destroy cypherpunks.
The answer is pretty obvious if you just think about it... if the list is "private" (i.e. private PROPERTY), then the person who *owns* it gets to make the decision.  The owner can even make the decision arbitrarily.
The decision to remove Vulis, however, does not seem arbitrary.  It was not, I think, based on a whim.
If you owned a bar in a libertarian society, and one of your patrons stood up on the bar and took a whiz, would you say that his self-expression was censored when the bouncer tossed him out on his arse?  Would you call it I think it was very well thought out and I think Adamsc knew exactly what he was saying.

What if John didn't prevent him "suvscribing", but instead directed his software to simply send messages from Vulis back to him as though they were sent to the list, but in fact did not forward his messages to the rest of the list.  Vulis would continue to (spit) and (fart) on the list, would assume everyone else saw it, but would not see any replies to his spew.  His remailer (spits) would still get through, but think how much less noise there would be.
Alternatively, he could just moderate the list and not forward his rantings at all.  LOTS more work, but still feasible.
All I'm saying is that it *is* possible for John to censor Vulis from this list if he was so inclined.

American Banker, 10/24/96
Gonzalez pushing consumer safeguards for electronic banking
Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez called Wednesday for aggressive congressional
action to protect consumers in the emerging world of electronic banking.
Releasing a blueprint for legislative action, the Texas Democrat urged
Congress to: *Adopt public policy standards relating to privacy,
disclosure, access, equity, and financial reliability for electronic
banking products and services.
*Hold oversight hearings to assess how well the industry is serving the
consumer in these five areas.
*Enact laws if the industry's performance falls below minimum
congressional standards.
*Define financial transactions to include the exchange of financial
information as well as cash.
*Consider revising current consumer protection laws. "Many of the
federal consumer protection laws are nearly 30 years old, and they were
not designed to deal with the effects of these new technologies," said
Rep. Gonzalez, the House Banking Committee's ranking minority member.
The report, "Connecting Consumers: Consumer Issues and Emerging
Financial Technology," recommends subjecting banks and nonbanks to the
same laws and regulations in this area. Republican committee members and
banking regulators have been reluctant to issue rules that might hinder
the development of new electronic banking products.

Of course, banning the burning of the flag only proves their point.

That was the defense, yes.  Dan White was a former cop and treated like a hero by fellow cops.  The prosecution never really challenged the Twinkie defense, nor did they bring up politics or homophobia as motives.  With a prosecution like that, who needs a defense?

How pedantic.  Webster's New World Dictionary (also reputable, I might add),
has THIS to say about "Anarchy":
  anarchy n. [Gr. an- without + archos, leader] 1. the absence of government
  2. political disorder and violence 3. disorder; confusion
Note the etymology.  Taken to its roots, the word simply means "no leader".
It also says:
  anarchism n. [see anarchy] 1. the theory that all organized government is
  repressive and undesirable 2. resistance to all government
Note the COMPLETE lack of "chaos" or "disorder" in this definition.  Being an anarchist, therefore, does NOT imply that one supports chaos and rgds-- TA  (tallard at frb.gov)

So, in other words, you agree with Tim about your definition of Rawanda as an example of anarchy:
The topic at hand was "Do governments kill more than individuals?".
Bringing Rawanda up as a counter-example to government and calling it an
anarchy is kind of dishonest, don't you think?  In the context of THIS
discussion, "anarchy" can only be the first definition, "no government".
Rawanda is not an anarchy in the sense of "no government," it's simply an
anarchy in the sense that the government is in disorder.  One faction of
government is fighting for control of government over another.
We can tally up the deaths in Rawanda to those created by government.

I didn't start this discussion.  But the question remains... are we better
with or without governments.  If you argue that we need gov't for safety,
it seems valid to ask under which system will have less killing.  It seems
to me that situations like Rawanda are just more examples of how gov'ts can
kill more people and more efficiently than any single mass murderer.
And speaking of the sidelines, what, exactly, are YOU doing about it?
Why on Earth can't you can't up the lives?  It's pretty easy.  Hitler was
worse than Manson because he killed millions while Manson was only able to
kill, what, less than a dozen?  None of their victims deserved to die.  But
if Hitler hadn't been able to take control of the German gov't, fewer people
would have been killed (unless some other crazy got the gov't).
                                                     ^^^^^^^
                  ^^^^^^
A classic case of pot & kettle syndrome.
It is, however, difficult to argue that "anarchy" is better than gov't when
someone's definition of "anarchy" is not "no government".
