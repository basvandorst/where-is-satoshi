If memory serves me right, when was revealed information about Colossus 2 (built in 1940x), it was pretty astonishing that it has computation power as very specialised computation device same as compared generic computation device with Pentium platform running C program which is doing same. So they were equal in solving these specific problem of decrypting messages. Now you can make assumptions what they should have very specialised hardware-based for solving tasks of decrypting AES, etc

If so, then worth to have a look at hardened gentoo to have full
control over the process how the system is built, what patches are
applied, etc
