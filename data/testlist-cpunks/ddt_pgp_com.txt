@_subject: Cypherpunks December Meeting (SF Bay Area) 
[wide distribution: please excuse any duplicates you may receive]
The Cypherpunks December 96 Physical Meeting is being hosted by Pretty Good Privacy, Inc. We've rented a meeting room at the Hotel Sofitel (see below) that can accomodate ~100 people. There will be munchies, and I think this qualifies as a cypherpunk milestone of sorts, so I hope lots of you show up.
Please see .
General Info:
1) RSVP's
Please RSVP ASAP to  if you plan to attend (reply to this with "cpunks-mtg-rsvp" as the Subject). It's very important that I have a clear idea of how many humans plan to attend as soon as possible, because we're also providing refreshments/snacks which we need to order from the hotel in advance. Thanks.
2) Location/Time
We'll be holding this "Open Meeting on US Soil" at the:
 Hotel Sofitel
 223 Twin Dolphin Drive
 Redwood Shores CA 94065
 415.598.9000 tel
Meeting time is 11 AM - 5 PM (a Sofitel time slot), as we have to be out of the room shortly after 5 PM for a wedding setup).
The Sofitel is a block or two south of the shining Oracle towers on Twin Dolphin Drive, which is easily accessible from Hwy 101 (on the east/SF Bay side of the freeway) in Redwood City (12 miles south of SFO airport and a few miles south of the Hwy 92/San Mateo Bridge junction as references).
There are directions and a simple GIF map at the meeting info URL.
 .
NOTE: when you arrive at the Sofitel, look for signage pointing to the exact room we're meeting in, or inquire at the main desk. Bring your friends.
3) Demos
If you want to demo something at the meeting, tell me ASAP(!). We encourage anyone who has anything Cypherpunks-related to present (even stuff that's already been seen before but which has been updated) to bring/show it. I'm going to set the arbitrary cutoff date for demo reservations as 11:59 PM on Thursday 12 December: we can have the right equipment ready for you if you list what you need in detail. If you wait until the last minute and bandwidth is limited, we may not be able to fit you in, unless you have something very simple to show, so please bear that in mind.
There will be overhead projection and an RGB projector available. Net connections can be arranged with advance notice. Right now, we have not arranged anything beyond a Metricom modem (28.8Kbps), but we can arrange an analog modem line or even an ISDN if there's a specific need. Tell me soon(!).
4) Handouts/Door Prizes/Raffle
Handouts are welcome: please give me your stack of handouts for the table when you arrive. If you want to pass out detailed mailbomb instructions, please do it outside the building at your own risk (inside the meeting, please refrain from getting PGP Inc in trouble, we do enough of that ourselves already ;).
There will be door-prizes from PGP, but supplies are limited if 100 people show up. We may also raffle off some software (upgradable when our new stuff comes out).
5) PGP Key "Thing"
Bring a printout of your key fingerprint/key. Or a diskette version, or both. We'll have a key exchange/signing session at the end of the meeting.
6) PGP/MIME BOF at the IETF
The IETF's PGP/MIME BOF is Friday 13 Dec, 9:00-11:30 AM (Crystal Room, Fairmont Hotel, 170 South Market St. in Downtown San Jose, 408.998.1900 main). Since it's a Birds Of a Feather session, I think interested people in the San Jose area can show up if they want. Please come by if you want to help support RFC 2015 so PGP/MIME can take the next step toward IETF Working Group discussion so we can eventually move it to the IETF Standards Track process. Anyone who's at the IETF is encouraged to stay over until Saturday and come to the Cypherpunks meeting too!

100 people for the meeting. Besides the maximum capacity restrictions on
the meeting room (fire codes), it's important that we have an idea of

because we're also arranging for refreshments/snacks (you do not need to
bring anything to eat/drink this time). Thank you for your
If you want to make a Cypherpunks-related presentation or demo
software/etc at the meeting, please notify the chairperson before the
meeting. (ASAP!) Everyone with something to say or show is encouraged to
bring/show it (even stuff that's already been demoed before but which
has been updated).
The cutoff date for demo reservations is also 11:59 PM Thursday 12
December. We can try to have the equipment you might need ready if you
list what you need in detail (and early): otherwise, bring your own
equipment. Though we'll do our best to accomodate everyone, if you wait
until the last minute, there may not be room for you unless you have
something very simple/brief, so please bear that in mind.
There will be overhead projector for transparencies and an RGB projector
for laptops. Net connections (analog modem, ISDN) can be arranged with
enough advance notice. Right now, we have not arranged anything beyond a
Metricom modem (28.8Kbps), but we can arrange an analog modem line or
even an ISDN if there's a specific need. Tell me soon(!).
Paper handouts are welcome: please give me your stack for the handout
table when you arrive.
There will be door-prizes from PGP, but supplies will be limited if 100
people show up. We will also to raffle off some PGP software (ViaCrypt
stuff, upgradable when our new versions arrive).
PGP Key Exchange
Bring a printout of/screen with your PGP key fingerprint. Or a diskette
version if you want to have it signed (or both). We'll have a "key
exchange moment" at the end of the meeting to faciitate expansion of the
PGP Web of Trust.
Meeting Time
Meeting time is 11 AM to 5 PM. This is slightly earlier than usual for a
Cypherpunks meeting because we have to be out of the meeting room
shortly after 5 PM (so a wedding can be set up), but we can meet in
small informal groups in the hotel lobby/bar after the meeting.
PGP/MIME BOF at the IETF
The IETF's PGP/MIME BOF is the previous morning: Friday 13 Dec,
9:00-11:30 AM (Crystal Room, Fairmont Hotel, 170 South Market St. in
Downtown San Jose, 408.998.1900 main). Remember: it's a "Birds Of a
Feather" session on the last day of the IETF conference (make of that
what you will). Please come by if you want to help support RFC 2015 so
PGP/MIME can take the next step toward IETF Working Group discussion so
we can eventually move it further along the IETF Standards Track. Anyone
who's at the IETF is of course encouraged to stay over until Saturday
and come to the Cypherpunks meeting too!

@_subject: passphrase protection (was: Re: [PGP-USERS] Security LeakPrograms) 
In Reply to the Message wherein it was written:
Indeed, Floyd: the dirty little secret is that passphrase protection is a more serious weakness than almost any other factor. I don't just mean dictionary attacks: those are way too expensive if you can just grab a text stream saved to an invisible file on an unsuspecting user's net-accessible machine. The new generation of PGP software (3.x) includes several new prompts/enhancements to the passphrase entry process: perhaps subsequent releases could take those even further into the realm of system-level monitoring.
I started doing an informal survey of all key capture utilities (on all platforms) a couple of years back, but there were so few utilities publicly available back then, very few respondents came back at me with items to list.
It occurred to me then that if there _were_ persons trying to grab passphrases from an individual's machine, it would be a significant advantage to have "invisible" keystroke monitors and for all knowledge of the existence of such utilities to remain a closely-guarded secret (from, say, the laptop of an FBI counter-intelligence instructor suspected of selling secrets to foreign agents for a few hundred thousand dollars, or something improbable like that). However, it's not the "good guys" we mainly need to be concerned with: there is a great deal of industrial espionage that needs some sunshine. The viability of personal privacy software in the marketplace is threatened if such utilities spread: as a responsible company protecting both the public's interest and our own company's survival, we need to plan for very sophisticated passphrase attacks and constantly educate users about this danger.
That having been said, this invisible "HiddenOasis" item you mention is a new one to me: I'd like a copy to test in our lab and my interest in hearing about everyone's favorite keycapture utility is rekindled. Maybe my boss will let me devote, oh, about 0.73% of my time to this. ;)
PGP's engineers have already spec'ed out some good defenses against subtle attacks like ion migration (memory burn-in), and with everyone's help (we can't watch every security leak, that's why we need you guys!), we can continue to work up defenses against such wee beasties. Any whistleblowers are also invited to drop a dime: my public key is widely available (even clickable) through the header URL above and we still have anonymous remailers in this country. Nudge-nudge, say no more, etc.
This gives new meaning to the term "spook"...
It's quite a shocking feeling to realize what defaults are built into some popular commercial apps, isn't it?  :/  You don't often see "insignificant" items like this get mentioned in any popular reviews either. It could be that even more users out there are ignorant of this issue than there are sysadmins who haven't read up on the SYN attack.
If confirmed, this is an absolutely unconscionable design flaw, IMHO.
Anyone who has a specific comment (include URLs if possible), please mail me and put "passphrase protection" somewhere in the subject line.
<"mailto:ddt at pgp.com?subject=passphrase protection">
I'll collect them, filter to our engineers where appropriate and eventually, when we have enough for a decent matrix, I'll either post a summary on our website or write up an informational RFC.

Indeed, and any malignant passphrase-snarfer is probably going to
anticipate this counter-attack and scramble the text stream it saves
invisibly so that disk sector searches will be unlikely to pop up your
passphrase. We definitely need to build better defenses against this sort
of thing.

           MonoTel smartcard and I dialled the passcode. Then it sucked the
           card in and didn't give it back to me! I figured it was enough."

           sort of collateral will you be putting up for this call? Do you
           own or rent?

Computer Coding Could Cripple Cops, FBI Warns
 By Aaron Pressman
WASHINGTON, July 9 (Reuter) - FBI Director Louis Freeh on Wednesday issued
his sternest warning yet that widespread use of computer encoding
technology could wreak havoc on crime-fighting efforts.
But computer industry participants warned that U.S. restrictions on
encryption products, which scramble information and render it unreadable
without a password or software "key," would merely boost sales by foreign
Freeh urged Congress to promote the use of a type of encryption that allows
law enforcement agents to crack the codes by getting access to the software
"Law enforcement is in unanimous agreement that the widespread use of
robust non-key recovery encryption ultimately will devastate our ability to
fight crime and prevent terrorism," the FBI director testified before the
Senate Judiciary Committee.
Freeh has spoken out numerous times against the unrestricted export of
strong encryption products, but his remarks Wednesday focused mainly on the
threat to law enforcement efforts within the United States.
Current laws impose tight controls on encryption exports but domestic use
is completely unregulated and some scholars believe restrictions on U.S.
citizens might be unconstitutional.
Much of Wednesday's hearing rehashed well-worn arguments in the encryption
debate. The software industry has backed legislation to relax export
controls and promote the use of encryption as a means of securing
electronic commerce and global communications over the Internet. Freeh and
other members of the Clinton administration oppose those policies.
Sen. Patrick Leahy, who is co-sponsor of a bill to dramatically relax
export controls, argued that use of encryption could help prevent crimes.
"Taking affirmative steps to use strong encryption can aid law enforcement
and protect national security by limiting the threat of industrial
espionage and foreign spying, and reducing the vulnerability of electronic
information to online snoops and breaches of privacy," the Vermont Democrat
Raymond Ozzie, author of the popular Lotus Notes messaging software, said
the private sector's experience with key recovery schemes revealed
significant problems. "All key management systems are inherently subject to
failure of one sort or another," Ozzie, chairman of IBM Corp. subsidiary Iris Associates, testified. "Mandated key management and key
recovery methods remove diversity and centralize our vulnerabilities," he
"This is likely to increase crime," Ozzie said. In addition to the Leahy
measure, the Senate is also considering a bill sponsored by Sen. John
McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Sen. Bob Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska.
That measure would continue to strictly limit export of encryption without
key recovery and require all computer networks used by the federal
government or funded in part by the government to include key recovery.
The Kerrey-McCain bill faces substantial opposition in the Senate, said
Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a
Washington-based cyber civil rights group.
"I don't think it has clear sailing on the Senate side," he said. An
industry-backed bill in the House similiar to the Leahy approach has strong
support and is expected to be approved by the International Relations
Committee there soon, Rotenberg added.

A message from our Fearless Leader...
   dave
................................. cut here .................................
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Last month, Pretty Good Privacy Inc went through a  reorganization in
its top management.  We were spending too much money, too fast.  Tom
Steding was replaced by Phil Dunkelberger as the president of PGP, and
I handed over the chairman title to Jonathan Seybold, who had been, with
me, the original cofounder of the company.  Jonathan is devoting his time
to the business side of things, while I am focussing my attention on my
role as chief technology officer.
I have seen some speculation in some usenet newsgroups that these changes
were in some way connected with the fact that PGP was recently sued by RSA
Data Security over some dispute regarding royalties for use of the RSA
patent, which PGP holds a license to.  Let me set the record straight
on this.  There are sound business reasons why this shuffling of top
management occurred at PGP, and these reasons are known to all of our
employees.  The RSA lawsuit against PGP is absolutely not one of the
reasons, not even remotely.  I don't think shuffling top management is
a likely reaction for any company to take in response to a lawsuit, even
if the lawsuit had merit, which this one does not.  We fully expect the
RSA matter to be resolved in arbitration proceedings, in our favor.
I know that it is common practice for some companies to issue statements
to "spin" the story about certain events, sometimes at the expense of
truth.  This makes a lot of people understandably skeptical about such
explanations.  I do have responsibilities toward my company, but no
one could get me to deny a truth about the reasons for the restructuring.
The truth is, the restructuring had absolutely nothing at all to do with
the RSA lawsuit.
I would now like to announce that we will be releasing PGP 5.0 in mid-June.
It's in beta release right now on our web page (  In keeping
with my own dedication to personal freedom and privacy, we will be releasing
a freeware version for noncommercial use through MIT's web site
(web.mit.edu/pgp), just like in the old days before the company was formed.
And we do plan to publish the full PGP source code for Mac, Windows 95,
and Linux.
There are a lot of new exciting features, including automatic key lookups
from remote key servers on the Internet, which will likely result in the
rapid growth of a ready-made nationwide PGP public-key infrastructure,
on an unprecedented scale.  We are also encouraging the migration to new
public key algorithms in addition to RSA, namely the NIST Digital
Signature Standard (DSS), as well as Diffie-Hellman (Elgamal) keys.
We expect most of the new users to be using these new algorithms instead
of RSA, in part because they offer new features, better performance, and
better security for the same key sizes.  I hope that you will all join me
in this opportunity to move to these new algorithms, allowing everyone to
finally enjoy the use of public key cryptography without the encumberances
of patents.

Sure, Wabe, just not for Outlook Express, which doesn't support plugins of
any type.
We do hope, though (with MS help), to have PGP (v6) built into Outlook
Express v5.0 sometime next Spring (as well as into Outlook).

White House policy chief backs away from FBI plan
  By Reuters September 5, 1997, 6:10 a.m. PT
WASHINGTON--The Clinton administration's top official on domestic legal
policy yesterday backed away from a proposal by the head of the FBI to
regulate access to residential property in the United States.
"What he proposed was not the administration's policy," Dept. of Justice
Undersecretary William "Mon-key" Wrench told reporters during a break at a
congressional hearing.
FBI Director Louie Free's comments Wednesday before a subcommittee of the
Senate Judiciary Committee sparked strong criticism from civil liberties
groups and the housing industry.
U.S. law, Supreme Court decicisions, and the U.S. Constitution itself,
strictly regulates law inforcement's access to private property. But on
Wednesday, Free proposed mandatory law inforcement access to all domestic
residential property, and went on to suggest commercial property be subject
to law inforcement access as well.
"The administration has been very clear to the director that he has an
obligation to tell the Congress what's in the interests of law enforcement,
and he did that," Wrench explained. "That doesn't mean he was speaking for
Free said developers and construction companies should build their products
such that they give government free access to all domestic and commercial
Without such capabilities, criminals, terrorists, and pedophiles could use
housing to hide their illegal activities from law enforcement agencies,
Free said.
But housing industry lobbyists maintain that Free's plan would make their
products less attractive and make all housing less secure. Civil liberties
groups said mandatory controls on domestic housing might violate
constitutional guarantees of privacy and freedom of expression.
Under the FBI director's proposal, all construction plans would have to
include special "back doors" allowing government access to the finished
structures, but residents could choose to shut their back door if they saw
Some senators wanted to go further. Sen. Dianne Fineline (D--California)
proposed requiring all housing residents to enable the back-door access
feature. Free said such a law would be the best solution for law
enforcement but added that he did not think it was politically viable.
Wrench said Free's proposal was also unlikely to pass.
"If the committee were to report that [bill out], I think that would be
something we would look at very seriously," he said. "But I don't expect
that to happen. We have not asked them to report that and we are not going
to ask them to report that."

INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE OFFERS ALTERNATIVE ENCRYPTION LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS
SECURITY CONCERNS
SEPTEMBER 11, 1997
CONTACT (202) 225-4121
The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) today
approved, by voice vote, legislation proposing an alternative to pending
encryption legislation, known as the "Security and Freedom Through
Encryption Act" (H.R. 695).
The HPSCI amendment in the nature of a substitute to HR 695 proposes
safeguards in the law to meet national security and law enforcement
concerns in the debate over the future of United States Encryption policy.
"All members of Congress, and particularly those of us on the Intelligence
Committee, have a responsibility to find the proper balance between forward
thinking commercial policies and the unquestioned need to protect the
security of the American people and America's national interests. We are
offering proposals to ensure that we do not plow full steam ahead into the
21st century's information age having seriously weakened our ability to
protect the national security, " said HPSCI Chairman Porter J. Goss
"American citizens have a right to their privacy and their access to the
freest possible markets. But they also have a right to their safety and
security. Terrorist groups that plot to blow up buildings; drug cartels
that seek to poison our children, and those who proliferate in deadly
chemical and biological weapons are all formidable opponents of peace and
security in the global society. These bad actors must know that the United
States' law enforcement and national security agencies, working under the
proper oversight, will have the tools to frustrate illegal and deadly
activity and bring international criminals to justice," Goss said.
"The bill referred to the Intelligence Committee attempts to deal with
complex issues. The substitute adopted by the Committee addresses the
legitimate national security and law enforcement concerns that are simply
not addressed in H.R. 695. In that respect, the Committee substitute, in my
judgment, furthers the debate on these important matters," noted Ranking
Democrat Norm Dicks (WA-6).
The main elements of the Intelligence Committee's proposal are:
* Requires exports of encryption products to submit to a one-time review
and to include features or functions (that need not be enabled by the
manufacturer) allowing for immediate access to plaintext or to decryption
* Requires that encryption products manufactured and distributed for sale
or use, or import for sale or use, in the United States after January 31,
2000 include features or functions that provide, upon presentment of a
court order, immediate access to plaintext data or decryption information
from the encryption provider;
* Does not change law enforcement's statutory requirements prior to
intercepting oral, wire, or electronic (wireless) communications, or law
enforcement's requirements prior to obtaining stored data. Law enforcement
will specifically be required to obtain a separate court order to have
data, including communications, decrypted;
* Allows for law enforcement access with delayed notification requirements,
similar to those allowed in current wiretap statutory provisions:
* Provide civil remedies and criminal penalties for unlawful access to or
disclosure of plaintext or decryption information;
* Require US government procurement of encryption technology that includes
functions or features allowing for immediate access to plaintext or
decryption information.
"Our committee has weighed in on these issues in the interest of furthering
the important debate now underway about how best to accomplish the multiple
goals of a sound encryption policy. Any encryption legislation we consider
must take a balanced approach to the national security, law enforcement,
public safety and privacy issues at stake. Our action today marks another
step in this process, which no doubt will continue to unfold in the days
and weeks ahead. I look forward to working with all sides on this debate as
we tackle this complex but important issue," Goss said.
The HPSCI, which sought and received sequential referral of H.R. 695, is
one of five House committees with jurisdiction on this issue. The
Committees on Judiciary, International Relations, National Security and
Commerce have also considered this legislation. The HPSCI expects to file
its committee report with the House tomorrow, meeting its deadline for
action set by the Speaker.

@_subject: [CFP98] "How to Choke the Net" 
The CFP98 program committee is considering a panel (or possibly a
pre-conference tutorial) for next year entitled something like "How to
Choke the Net." (The provocative title is NOT intended to espouse the
practice of net-choking NOR to provide hands-on techniques.)
 "Many have argued that the net is so decentralized that no one country or
  force could control it, but is that really true? Many, including religions
  (Scientologists) and countries (China, et alia) have tried, but is the net
  so decentralized that it cannot be controlled, or are there choke points
  at which a single entity (or cartel of entities) could exploit to shape
  the net for their own political purposes, despite the efforts of others.
  The panel will explore the current state of the decentralization of the
  net and its potential for exploitation in an educational-style format."
Discussion topics may include host authentication, denial-of-service
attacks, DNS, IPSEC, routing issues and SYN-flooding, etc. If any of you
has any course materials you'd like to deliver on the topic of Internet
vulnerabilities and defenses, please contact me.
