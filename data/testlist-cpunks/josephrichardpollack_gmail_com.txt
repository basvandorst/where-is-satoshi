@_subject: [drone-list] Using UAVs in Humanitarian Crises to Restore 
Dear List,
I'm looking into how tough and expensive and illegal it would be to use DIY
or low-cost UAVs to restore connectivity or "gather" messages (SOS or
otherwise) from populations affected by humanitarian crises. Any thoughts
or suggestions?
Warm Regards,
