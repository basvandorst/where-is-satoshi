I have 2 items of note for this list.
1. The web site is updated with program and the times.
2. I was typing fast, and mistyped my title. I am General Chair this
year, not 2002 as was stated.

@_subject: [Cryptography] In the face of "cooperative" end-points, PFS doesn't help 
I think we are growing closer to agreement, PFS does help, the question is how much in the face of cooperation. Let me suggest the following. With RSA, a single quiet "donation" by the site and it's done. The situation becomes totally passive and there is no possibility knowing what has been read.  The system administrator could even do this without the executives knowing. With PFS there is a significantly higher profile interaction with the site. Either the session keys need to be transmitted  in bulk, or the RNG cribbed. Both of these have a significantly higher profile,  higher possibility of detection and increased difficulty to execute properly. Certainly a more risky think for a cooperating site to do. PFS does improve the situation even if cooperation is suspect. IMHO it is just better cryptography. Why not? It's better. It's already in the suites. All we have to do is use it... I am honestly curious about the motivation not to choose more secure modes that are already in the suites?
