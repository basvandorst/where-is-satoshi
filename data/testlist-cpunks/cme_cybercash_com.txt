Washington Post investigative reporter JIM McGEE. He has co-written with Brian Duffy the new book "Main Justice: The Men And Women Who Enforce The Nation's Criminal Laws And Guard Its Liberties." It's published by Simon and Schuster. The book is about the changing role of the U.S. Justice Department. As the fears of terrorism increase, Congress and the White House are giving the Justice Department more investigative powers and a wider jurisdiction which includes
actions in foriegn countries. McGee warns in the book that along with the apparent protection this could provide Americans it could also erode individual liberties. McGee shared a 1987 Pulitzer Prize for a series of stories on the Iran Contra Affair. McGee lives in Virginia.

I should let Microsoft defend their own turf, but they told me
they will sign anyone's CSP.  Once the CSP is signed, Microsoft is
off the export hook.  It's now *your* problem to obey the export
laws or keep your CSP inside the country.  That's what's so brilliant
about the MS CSP design.  By getting them off the hook for enforcing
export laws, they can write S/W to call the CSP and just plain ignore
the export hassles.

That's the killer.  Signatures take a huge amount of CPU time.  Signing
each packet is not going to be cost effective.
However, they could have an authenticated key exchange and then symmetric-
encrypt each TCP/IP connection.  That can perform -- and has the nice
side effect [from the Chinese POV] of depriving the NSA of Chinese civilian
net intelligence.  As long as the key exchange is signed, everything
travelling using that key is authenticated implicitly.

Assuming we really believe the net is a good thing, if the Chinese block

They could as easily refuse to connect to the rest of the world.
The more they repress their population, the more their population will
want to rise up in protest -- maybe not this millenium but probably in
the next.
All we have to be sure of is that we don't let the Chinese dictate to us
what content we can provide.  It's like the CDA.  The Chinese might choose to
implement a nation-wide SurfWatch at all connection points at its borders.

@_subject: A brief comparison of email encryption protocols 
We're working on some of these issues, as we speak, over in the SPKI mailing
list.  Some of my contributions are available on
        The one some of us advocate is a web of certificates, each one of which
assigns a specific attribute or permission to a public key.
These certificates are not tied to human identities, but a human identity
can be attached as yet another attribute of a public key via a certificate
for that purpose.
For many attributes to be attached to a public key [e.g., permission to
spend money, permission to speak for an organization, ...] there is no
need for a human identity beyond the implicit one of "the person who
knows how to exercise the indicated private key" which comes with any
public key.
We're proposing a third certificate format.  X.509 is an identity
certificate, unless one bends it severely.  Signed PGP keys are also
a kind of identity certificate.  Our proposal is an attribute certificate,
not an identity certificate.  It is simple to lookup these certs.
Like X.509, my certs have an Issuing-name and a Subject-name -- but
they're both cryptographic hashes of public keys.  You can take a portion
of those hashes [e.g., low order 12 bits] and use it to index a hash table
of certificates or keys.  The cert is more general than X.509 -- that is,
it includes all of X.509 and then some [because we don't require some
binding to a human identity, don't require a Certificate Authority, ...].
Our first format is RFC822-like -- so it's easy to parse and generate and
read and use.  It's very rich and flexible.  We're working to make it
an IETF standard.  It does not use ASN.1 and has none of the baroqueness
of X.509.
In fact, these certs can be formed as PGP clear-signed messages.
We're using RSA or whatever else you want [e.g., DSA].  In fact, in our
cert format, you can use DSA to sign an RSA key, a PGP key to sign a
Fortezza key, etc.

@_subject: A brief comparison of email encryption protocols 
Our current straw-man uses the following to identify a key within a certificate:
KEY_ID ::=             []
           []
It is assumed that the key is in a cache at the verifier.  The verifier can
add it to his cache by having it sent to him directly, by fetching it
via the URL (if present), or through some other means.
One of my co-workers [Donald Eastlake] is proposing distribution of keys
via the DNS and that sounds fine, too.
We weren't tying the distribution problem to the certificate problem.
They really are separate.
Revocation is a separate problem.  My personal preference [quite seriously]
is not to allow for revocation -- rather to issue certificates with a
validity only long enough to get the job done but not so long that you'd
be seriously damaged by having an invalid cert honored.  There's no way to
get 100%, immediate validation [by non-existence on a revocation list].
For more words on this subject, see cert.html.
If one really needs CRL checking, I'd recommend including a URL for the
Issuer's own revocation list as a field in the cert.

However, there is a plan afoot at TIS to produce a version of Gauntlet
with full 56-bit DES SWIPE -- but with TIS CKE added to the communication

If I have a cellular phone which encrypts over the air (between the phone and the base station) and I call you, while you have a normal wired phone, our call is protected by cryptography from interception off the air.
If I use an AT&T Clipper-style cellular phone, as David suggested, and I call you on a normal wired phone, we can't encrypt the conversation and it is vulnerable to interception.  The protection works *only* if both parties have encrypting phones while interoperate.

I'm really surprised to see this entire discussion resurface, especially without any apparent memory of the past 5 years that have hashed this topic The real issue, IMHO, is given in my Hitting closer to home for those of us who design crypto:
Our job is to permit Alice to communicate to Bob (or Alice at a later time) without Eve getting anything from that communication.
 E |
  +---+		  |		  +---+
 A |-------------+---------->| B |
  +---+				  +---+
The gov't wants us to achieve that goal but permit Dorothy the detective, D, to have access:
 D |
  +---+		  |		  +---+
 A |-------------+---------->| B |
  +---+				  +---+
Those two diagrams are identical except for labeling.  How can we tell E from D, as crypto designers?  Was J. Edgar Hoover an E or a D?  Nixon?  The LA Intelligence unit?  ....?
Meanwhile, the system to allow D but not E is hugely more complex than the system which prohibits both D and E.  And, as I argue elsewhere, , good strong non-GAK crypto in the hands of criminals should help law enforcement in their surveillance effort -- 1)	it encourages criminals to talk about their crimes with other criminals
2)	some percentage of those "other criminals" will be plants, informers or 3)	traffic analysis of these criminal conversations is not inhibited

Have each session key released individually

All requests include the name of the target and the

The gov't doesn't give any KE agent, judge or otherwise, permission to see the actual decrypted traffic to make sure it matches the excuse given on the request for access.  The gov't can always come back and say, "Well, he didn't say anything useful so we didn't record anything -- thanks for the key anyway."
If the gov't had to get content itself from a judge -- or, better, from the NYTimes, Wash Post, ACLU, etc. -- then maybe we'd be closer to a politically workable answer.  That is, it would be valueless as a covert intelligence tool.

Let me add one more I just posted to the cryptography list.
When you have non-GAK strong crypto for criminals to use, they (like the rest of us) will be seduced into believing that they have privacy and will loosen their tongues.  As a result, more and better intelligence will be available over that communications channel.  For the proportion of cases where the person on the other side is an agent or someone turned by threat of prosecution, this intelligence falls into the hands of law enforcement.  Even better, this person who is reporting to LE is remote from the real criminal(s), so he is in substantially less danger of being frisked to discover a wire.
