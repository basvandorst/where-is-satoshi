Hello all,
Yes, Zooko and I met at the end-of-Ecrypt II event on Tenerife early
2013 (24° C in January!).
I don't remember our conversation in detail, but I I'm sure Zooko is
citing me correctly because that is what we were thinking about at the
Actually, what we had in mind was to propose something like "Keccak2"
to compete with BLAKE2 by drastically cutting the number of rounds,
e.g., down to 12 rounds for Keccak-f[1600], but otherwise keeping the
algorithm as it is. That might have sent the wrong message indeed, but
we just didn't do it.
In contrast, the capacity is an integral parameter of the Keccak
family that we even proposed as user-tunable in our SHA-3 submission.
Matching the capacity to the security strength levels of [NIST SP
800-57] is simply exploiting that flexibility.
Kind regards,
Joan, also on behalf of my Keccak companions﻿
