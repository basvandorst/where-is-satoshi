True, but Gilmore clearly refused an order from the Captain despite his
view that the order to remove the badge was in breach of some rights that
he thought he had. At this point of refusal the presence of a badge
becomes secondary, and Gilmore has probably breached a few rules, such as
.. and maybe :
if you could class Gilmore's actions as disorderly.
.. and :
where the duties could have been those of the flight assistant to have the
badge removed.
I felt sorry for the other 300 people on the plane who had their flight
delayed for some guy with a small badge on his chest, and a big chip on
his shoulder.

Result is an ugly Verisign search engine page.
