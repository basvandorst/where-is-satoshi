In these papers several extensions of self-certified keys, which make them more competitive compared with certificate-based keys are presented. The main features of self-certified keys lie in their easy
availability and accessibility. Other parameters than system parameters are not required to be authentic. Therefore large databases with certified public keys (TTPs) are not needed any more. However, small lists with the authentic public keys of the certification authorities are still needed. The properties of self-certified keys are:

We have to live with the fact that industry has a janus head.
On one hand - and here we should follow their example - they are reluctant to allow somebody else to keep their keys in trust.
On the other hand - in contradiction to the previous - they invest in development of key escrow systems including key management protocols which allow third parties having uncontrolled access to keys.

Extract from ERCIM News No. 31:
CWI factors Giant Number in Record-Time
On Wednesday, 3 September, one of the several hundred computers at CWI yield the two prime factors of the 180-digit number "see: Factor a 2048-bit number", also written as (12^167+1)/13. The factors were found after only twelve days of computation on 85 SGI/Cray computers at CWI.  One special step in the computation requiring huge memory space, was carried out at the Amsterdam Academic Computer Centre SARA.
The 180-digit number is the largest factored so far with the method employed here-the Special Number Field Sieve (SNFS).  The previous record (See: the factoring of a 167-digit number, was established last February by an international group of researchers who joined efforts through Internet.  However, this job still required two months of computing time.  In establishing the new record, CWI only used in-house resources.  The record time - a speed-up with a factor five compared to the previous record - was due to recent software improvements by CWI researchers who moreover used faster computers than their predecessors. The used code was originally developed at Oregon State University and by the Dutch mathematician Arjen Lenstra (now at Citibank, New York).  During the last few years CWI has continually improved this code, leading to several world records in this research field.  The American company Microsoft will shorty acquire the right!
 to use this code, in order to become more familiar with the newest factoring technologies.  With a related method, the General Number Field Sieve, the reliability of widely used cryptographic codes is tested.

@_subject: Newsflash 
The European Commission today adopted a proposal for an Action Plan on promoting safe use of the Internet.
This takes the form of a Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions with a proposal for a Council decision adopting a Multiannual Community Action Plan on promoting safe use of the Internet.
The Action Plan is the follow up of earlier initiatives by the European Union, and refers directly to the 16 October 1996 Communication on Illegal and Harmful Content on the Internet and Green Paper on Protection of Minors and Human Dignity in Audiovisual and Information Services , and the Parliament resolutions of 24 April 1997 and 24 October 1997.
The Action Plan is closely linked with the Commission Communication and proposal for a Recommendation of 18 November 1997, which outlines political measures on protection of minors and human dignity in the audiovisual services ( The Action Plan contains action lines on creating a safe environment through establishing a European network of hot-lines and industry self-regulation, developing filtering and rating systems and awareness action.

Those who are affected in the first place are US companies who
are used to collect and process personal data from their customers
without any embarrassment. They will be excluded from
the European market, if they do not follow European Data
Protection rules. Until now the US goverment has decided to leave this matter to self regulation. However, US industry did not manage to come up with an appropriate codex. If industry
does not comply until the end of the year, FTC promised that
they will introduce a bill at congress which will comply with
European data protection standards. On the other hand, the US did
not even manage to adopt the Guidelines on the Protection
of Privacy and Transborder Flow of Personal Data by OECD.
The discrepancy in the US system is exposed by the fact that
general laws for data protection and privacy were avoided in
favour of specific laws for single areas or techniques.
Other countries, in particular those in Eastern and Central
Europe have, in spite of massive lobbying by D. Aaron, adopted
laws on data protection and privacy since they do not want
endanger their future participation in the EU.

@_subject: "We have to destroy privacy in order to protect privacy" 
What is privacy?
Just now the political representatives show the world how protection of privacy looks like in the world's leading Nation. Victim is the President himself who unwillingly has become a benchmark case because of his sexual affairs.
Although this is a matter of law, only political strategies are executed.
Protection of privacy turns out to be the most important human rights issue in this information technology age.
Definition of privacy is difficult. It includes not only data protection; it draws a line at the border where a society is allowed to get concerned about an individual.
Louis Brandeis, Member of the Supreme Court, said in 1890: The right for privacy is the right for an individual to live for him/her-self. Protection of privacy includes protection of private information, safety, protection of communication, and protection of territory (house, public space, and work place).
Following several articles in American newspapers, privacy at the work place is in great danger. Surveillance is very often made part of the contract with the employer. A Report by the American Management Association says that two thirds of employers are controlling emails and other work at the computer, and are tapping phone calls. Surveillance cameras are used, e.g., to trace movements of employees in company buildings; regular tests for drugs, requests for intimate information and various psychological tests are performed.
Many people in the US may believe this is normal. Who tells them that this a violation of privacy rights ? The government ? Bill Gates ? Tim May ? If companies are using personal data, which they have gathered from open sources, without explicit permission for other purposes than in direct business with that person, then they are violating data protection rules. If the sources are not open, then they are also violating fair competition rules which may be considered to be criminal in some countries.
Sifting through filing cabinets is also clearly a violation of privacy rights. However, does it mean that privacy is uncontrollable?  Alternatively, the only protection is not to put any personal data on a network. Use your pseudonym instead. Strong encryption does not help, because the receiver side may not respect your privacy.

Your scope of privacy seems to be rather narrow. It is not only communication.
Privacy is also needed on public places (e.g., violated by face recognition systems), at work places (e.g.,violated by telephone tapping), for your body (e.g., endangered by abortion control),
Copyright protection is only one way of hiding subsidies to industry. The amount
of money which is sometimes claimed in relation to copyright violation is wishful thinking.
If copyright protection would work, then the value of sold products will be much less.
A very small number of people would buy the product for the regular price. On the other
hand with piracy, the market share is growing extremely fast. The current situation
is hypocritical, because industry wants both.

It is important to set clear guidlines and codes of practice for such
technological innovations, well in advance of the digital revolution
making new and unforseen opportunities to collate, analyze, recognise
and store such visual images. Such regulation will need to be founded on sound data protection principles and take cognizance of
article 15 of the European Data Protection Directive. Essentially it
says that:
"Member States shall grant the right of every person not to be subject
to a decision which produces legal effects concerning him or significantly
affects him and which is based solely on the automatic processing of
The attitude to CCTV camera networks varies greatly in the European Union,
from the position in Denmark where such cameras ar banned by law to the
position in the UK, where you can find one of the most advanced CCTV network
coverage in Europe and where the issue of regulation and control have been
perhaps more developed then anywhere else.
