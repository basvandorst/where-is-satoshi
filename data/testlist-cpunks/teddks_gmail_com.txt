In the case In re United States, Judge Mosman ruled that there is no

Fourth Amendment does not apply to e-mails under the third-party doctrine.
'When a person uses the Internet, the user's actions are no longer in his or
her physical home; in fact he or she is not truly acting in private space at
all. The user is generally accessing the Internet with a network account and
computer storage owned by an ISP like Comcast or NetZero. All materials
stored online, whether they are e-mails or remotely stored documents, are
physically stored on servers owned by an ISP. When we send an e-mail or
instant message from the comfort of our own homes to a friend across town
the message travels from our computer to computers owned by a third party,
the ISP, before being delivered to the intended recipient. Thus, b
information is actually being held by third-party private companies."
"The case is In re United States, b F.Supp.2d b-, 2009 WL 3416240 (D.Or.
2009), by District Judge Mosman. The issue in the case is whether the
government must notify a person when the government obtains a search warrant
to access the contents of the personbs e-mail account. Judge Mosman
concludes that Rule 41 and 18 U.S.C. 2703(a) require the notice to be served
on the ISP, not the account holder, as a statutory matter. He then rules
that there is no constitutional requirement of notice to the account holder
because the Fourth Amendment does not apply to the e-mails under the

Perhaps this should be reason enough TO run a tor node?  Not for
Burma/Iran... but for those of us in the "first world" who are
threatened by police states ourselves?  It sometimes takes an
unfortunate rude awakening to realize this, but unfortunately there are
no real limits to the police in any country.
I for one no longer subscribe to the "smoke/fire" theory when I see the
police question or even arrest someone, or worse, the papers reporting a
crime.  When I see someone resist arrest, I cannot help but wonder "What
did the police officer do that is so unjust, because he (or more likely
an unjust law) must likely have done something to provoke a person to
resist arrest despite obvious overwhelming force!?"
I fear that if they someday come to take my computer, or much worse, my
children, that I might be easily driven mad, the knowledge of my
innocence will provide no comfort.  But I will not be stopped by this
fear.  I run an exit node to support those who share this fear and who
do not want to simply pretend that the authorities "know what they are
doing" or that "they have good reason", because I unfortunately already
know better from first hand experience.
Run a node for yourself, for the society you live in (it needs it), not
just for those far off in "oppressive regimes".  There is plenty of
oppression to go around locally.  If they come for you, remember what it
feels like to be innocent (assuming that you are); remember that when
they come for your neighbor (don't assume innocence or guilt, but
consider both), and consider lending your neighbor a helping or
comforting hand,

256-bit encryption for Twitter posts
As i announced yesterday, the new version of shrimp7 (31) support
compression for your Twitter, Facebook and Friendfeed posts. With that
technique you will be able to post messages that are longer then 140
characters. When i implemented message compression i had the idea to
implement a AES-256bit encryption method for shrimp7 version 32. I use
the same principles as the compression method i use. After encryption
Ibll add 2 characters in front of the string so applications could
recognize compressed or encrypted messages. These applications can
filter out this messages, or can offer a solution to decompress/decrypt
the message. When a compressed or encrypted message is found by shrimp7
it will show a lock-icon. For encrypted messages there is a possibility
to click on the lock-icon, fill in the key and read the original 12
billion $ message.
The characters i use for compressed messages are . and ! , for example:
.!test 4, shrimp7 coD
rDsed tweets. How manyDharsDD& DD0in?
C&B5B7.DtheD0eaE
undEDD>mDWaE
E fD> rE,n!
For AES encrypted messages i chose the . and ? , then a message could
look like this:
Using longer messages then 140 chars is not Twitters goal but there are
cases that it will be very handy. The idea for encrypting messages is
more easy: nobody can read the message unless they have the key to
decrypt the message. Handling a key to the user who need to read the
encrypted message is the most weakness in cipher/key encryption so be
careful while crossing the dessert to deliver a key to your friend!
Message encryption is not intended for use by criminals. There are
certainly cases that encryption on networks like Twitter can be a life
saver. To optimize encrypted messages shrimp7 also compress encrypted
messages. The compression for encrypted messages works really bad, but
winning 1 char is better then losing 1 characters.

condescending way, and for all the lip service paid to anarchism and
revolution, was ultimately limply liberal (spoiler: the book ends with
the protagonist urging the reader to get the Bad Guys out of power... by
VOTING! radical!).
More disturbingly, the book eschewed actually-existing technology in
favor of fictionalizing reality. Instead of using, say, Pidgin and OTR,
the characters used "ParanoidIM", which did _exactly_ the same thing.
Instead of using Freenet in darknet-mode, Doctorow invented the "XNet"
crap. Doctorow was good enough to include a real description of an
OpenPGP signing party, and an okay handling of webs of trust (he
conflated key-authenticity assertions with real trust, but at least he
acknowledge the subject at all), but for some reason didn't take the
friend-to-friend aspect far enough for it to be effective in real life.
If the Little Brother protagonist could get all his dissident friends to
generate and install OpenPGP software, they could have installed Freenet
and Tor. I know from experience it's possible for high school kids to do
A hilarious anecdote about the ParanoidLinux/ParanoidXbox is that one of
the highlighted characteristics in the book, and something (IIRC) the
real-world copycat project tried to reproduce, was "chaff".
ParanoidLinux had some program that automatically connected to "clean"
websites (I think MySpace was an example) and made it look like you
weren't doing anything special by "hiding the secure traffic in a
haystack of innocent connections". This chaff wasn't encrypted noise, it
didn't go out over Tor or anything like that, it just went out, in the
clear, directly to myspace.com.
I haven't read anything else of Doctorow's, but I hope that he got
himself a tech consultant after Little Brother, because his writing is
too good to be wasted on fictional revolution-manuals.

Here are my general impressions on the complaints.
*Tor is too complex.* Most of the people don't care about Tor per se. They
care about using Tor as a tool to get some task or function done.  In most
cases, this is protecting their identity online.  They don't want to buy in to
Tor, join our religion, nor subscribe to our newsletter.  They just want to
use it and not have to worry about it.  The exceptions to this were the
cyberstalking victim and the law enforcement officer.  Both felt Tor was too
complex, but cared very much about Tor as more than just a tool.  Neither
realized the Tor Browser Bundle existed.
*Lack of Adobe Flash breaks too many websites.*  People use Tor to circumvent
censorship to watch cats on YouTube and other video sites.  Apparently people
also use Tor for Facebook and a number of other sites that require Flash to be
functional.  One person told me that the risk of a rogue Flash app disclosing
their identity is acceptible over Tor.  The flash cookie problem is 'easily
taken care of by plugins, dude'.  I'm sensing that Flash is the main reason
people start with TBB and then move on to installing Tor locally; and finding
it complex and difficult to configure.  Perhaps the sandboxing technology
using in the OS X TBB will make its way into Windows and Linux soon.
*Tor's documentation is too hard to find on the Internet.*  I agree.  I have
trouble finding the docs and various configuration parameters needed.  This is
even more the case when someone is on the phone asking a question.  Clearly we
need to improve this for everyone.  Our docs are scattered across git, svn,
website, trac tickets, and wiki links.  Maybe one central location that pulls
all of this into some coherent page would be a good first step. Maybe a search
crawler that worked well would be also be a good step.
I welcome feedback and comments.

Senators seek crackdown on "Bitcoin" currency
ST. LOUIS (Thomson Reuters Accelus) - Two senators are pressing federal
authorities to crack down on an online black market and "untraceable"
digital currency known as Bitcoins after reports that they are used to
buy illegal drugs anonymously.
Democratic Senators Charles Schumer of New York and Joe Manchin of West
Virginia wrote to Attorney General Eric Holder and Drug Enforcement
Administration head Michele Leonhart in a letter that expressed concerns
about the underground website "Silk Road" and the use of Bitcoins to
make purchases there.
The letter prompted a discussion among Bitcoin enthusiasts about whether
the government was capable of closing related bank accounts and thereby
stifling the currency.
The senators released a copy of their letter on Monday. It cites recent
media reports that some tech-savvy individuals were using an
"anonymizing network" known as Tor to gain clandestine access to Silk
Road and buy illegal drugs.
Silk Road buyers pay with Bitcoins and sellers mail the drugs, the
Gawker blog reported. The transactions leave no traditional money trail
for investigators to follow, and leave it hard to prove a package
recipient knew in advance what was in a shipment.
"The only method of payment for these illegal purchases is an
untraceable peer-to-peer currency known as Bitcoins. After purchasing
Bitcoins through an exchange, a user can create an account on Silk Road
and start purchasing illegal drugs from individuals around the world and
have them delivered to their homes within days," the senators' letter
states. "We urge you to take immediate action and shut down the Silk
Road network."
The DEA is "absolutely" concerned about Bitcoins and other anonymous
digital currencies, agency spokeswoman Dawn Dearden said when asked for
a response to the senators' concerns.
"The DEA is constantly evaluating and analyzing new technologies and
schemes perpetrated by drug trafficking networks. While we won't confirm
or deny the existence of specific investigations, DEA is well aware of
these emerging threats and we will act accordingly," she said.
Silk Road may be hard to close. It could easily move from server to
server around the globe and change its Web address and name at will,
while remaining accessible through Tor.
However, Bitcoins must be purchased with real money; of late, they have
been selling for roughly $10 each.
Therefore, there are exchanges with bank accounts, such as the Mt. Gox
Bitcoin Exchange, that the Justice Department and other law enforcement
agencies may be able to target. It is this weak link that worries the
currency's enthusiasts.
A discussion thread this week on the primary Bitcoin forum was titled
"Will Mt. Gox US Bank accounts eventually get frozen?" Some speculated
that if the government bans transactions involving Bitcoin exchanges, a
layer of shell companies might allow them to continue.
One user described this process as simply "growing pains" and asserted
that the government "can't stop a peer-to-peer service."
U.S. law enforcers might have difficulty stopping Bitcoins without help
from their peers in other countries.
While little information about Bitcoin exchanges is publicly available,
an item posted on a website called Bitcoin Watch states that Mt. Gox's
bank account is in Japan, and anecdotal evidence suggests many other
exchanges operate outside of the US.
Mt. Gox's website does not list a phone number, representatives could
not be reached via email.

     1. Take rock
     2. Paint gold
     3. Sell to "Anon Mus" , who almost
        certainly is not capable of detecting whether or not something
        is actually gold or silver on their own
Alternatives to steps (1) and (2) include:
      * Buy pyrite
      * buy any silverish metal
      * buy plastic, form around weight
The moral here is, it's almost certainly not the case that a piece of
gold or silver can be verified cheaper than the Bitcoin block chain can
be verified.

Hopefully now the people on the mailing list who stupidly propose and
stupidly shoot down PET-related freedombox things will shut up, since
it's clear they have no actual say.
That's probably just as impossible a dream as the FreedomBox itself,
though (as specified by the FBF right now).

A lot of (sure, not all, but most) the PET-related ideas are stupid, and
shooting down ideas because they aren't in keeping with the "vision of
the FreedomBox" is stupid unless you work for the FBF and actually can
state with authority what is and isn't the freedombox.
The mailing list has turned into a platform for:
      * people with little to no PET experience to propose crazy ideas
        (like "the freedombox should square zooko's triangle out of the
        box" or "we should figure out how to use X.509 for a
        peer-to-peer horizontalist solution to whatever problem faces
        us")
      * people to shout down the above people with non-existent
        authority.
For a project that got a pretty good amount of money on kickstarter,
that's just stupid.

I guess my idea of a productive mailing list excludes posts about
technologically unworkable ideas from people who will never be able to
implement them that will never be adopted under the FB aegis. I think
that that's stupid, and I'm not afraid to say so.
It seems that you're okay with that, and that's okay -- it just means
you have more free time to read and ponder mailing list messages than I
do, or have a much lower possibility barrier when faced with possible
time investments.
But considering how vemently you attacked me for making a flip comment
about how I hoped unproductive/stupid mailing list traffic would
decrease on the freedombox list in the presence of an organized group
advancing the FBF agenda, I think at this point it's more probable that
you're just pissed off that I called you out for putting too much faith
in electoral democracy than that you have a strong inclination to defend
unproductive mailing list postings.

One of the things I've come to love about the sort of people that are on
tt/cypherpunks is that they tend to care more about action than
rhetoric. People can debate "intellectual property" and "pirates vs.
freedom fighters" forever, if you let them. But that seems not to happen
here, at least not very often.
So, who has a library.nu rip? I'd seed it.
