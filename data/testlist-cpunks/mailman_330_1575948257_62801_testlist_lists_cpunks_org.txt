@_subject: IBM Uses Keystroke-monitoring in NJ Mob Case (was Re: 
Law News (ILN) - 12/5/00)
An instructive case.  Apparently they used the keystroke monitoring
to obtain the pgp passphrase, which was then used to decrypt the files.
The legal fight over whether the monitor was legal and whether the
information so obtained are in fact records of criminal activity is a
side-show.  It remains practical evidence of how insecure computer
equipment / OS's and pass-phrase based identity authentication combine to
reduce the effective security of a system.
