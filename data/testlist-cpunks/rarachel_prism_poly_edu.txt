@_subject: New stego prog was "A possibility" 
Hey guys, I'm in the final throes of applying some cleaning up on a bit
of code I wrote a couple of years ago.  I'm wondering what would be some
good sites to FTP this to?  (I'd like to just post it up on here, but since
there are non-USA residents on this list, I don't need the NSA to come on
knocking on my door as I've bigger things to worry about (like bills,
graduating, etc.)
Anyhow, a bit about this code:  This is a program called White Noise
Storm which I wrote out of an inspiration flash (and subsequently the
reason I joined this list.)
I had left this project to rot until recently when my school finally offered
a crypto class, and decided on making this my project.  Unfortunatly disaster
struck and I had lost the final version of this program a few months ago,
having only a buggy, unfinished backup.  Suffice to say, I spent all last
night infront of my 486 and resurected WNSTORM from the dead, and in doing
so added some features which make it a useful program.
Someone from MicroSoft had a similar idea, so I thought I'd go public
with it before WNSTORM vanished totally. :-)  So Ophir Ronen (Rho) , here it comes. :-)
A brief description of this program is basically an cypher box that takes in
a password, a stream of random numbers, a plaintext file, and a window size
specification (more on this later.)  The program takes in one byte of
plaintext, several bytes of random numbers (called a window) of varying size,
and then takes an encrypted copy of the plaintext byte and spreads its bits
across the random number window.  The actual bits and bytes that get replaced
in this window depends on the passkey and the previous window.
The great and obvious disadvantage to WNSTORM is that the size of the cypher
text is several times larger than the plaintext.  Another is that this is a
private key system, but that's not quite as large a sore point.
However, by replacing the random number stream with the low bits of a sound, picture, movie or other noisy data, inserting the plaintext into
this noise with WNSTORM, and re-injecting the low bits back into the picture
gives us the possibility of an excellent stego system!
WNSTORM will also try and statistically fix the bits it changes so that the
outgoing cyphertext matches the incoming random noise stream statistically,
making a stego sniffer's job much harder...
Anyhow since I'll need to clean up both source code and documentation, I
thought I'd take this opportunity and announce the program.
Oh and Tim, this is what I was talking to you about a long time ago and kept
secret. :-)

@_subject: Safeway + Your Privacy 
As insidious as it seems, there are a couple of advantages to this
commercial invasion of privacy.  firstly it allows you to go through
the checkout counter a bit faster.  Secondly, it allows Safeway to
compile statistical information about what products you're interested
in, and can sell this information to advertisers, which would either
bombard you with junk mail, or unexpected/unwanted phonecalls, but
may also throw in some cupons to sweaten the deal.
(Of course the advantages are not quite all the shoppers...)  Now this
is fairly harmless, however, should something like DT2 require Safeway
to provide its database to the Feds, they will hold practically all
the information they could dream of having about an individual/family.
They can already get all the credit info, at the records of your bank
account, your credit card purchases, phone calls, food purchases, your
trash (sort of like dumpster diving, only more sinister), what more
could they possibly need to know you without your consent?
It really is time to get anon digital cash... :-I

I found this on comp-privacy.  Maybe we can use a scheme like this one to send
anti-clipper information over the net...  Does toad.com have a usenet news
feed?  If so, maybe we can have a program written that scans for keywords
and mails the author of the message some info about cypherpunks and clipper
and digital telespying 2.  I do however strongly suggest that the automail bomber keep records of who
it sent a particular anti-clipper message to.  We don't want to actually
mailbomb people with 500 copies of the same message.  Just one article would
We could also have this program autobomb different articles based on different
keywords.  It would be a good idea to also keep a list of names of those who
complained so we don't send'em anything again, and separate "already-sent-to"
lists for different articles with a central universal "no-send" list.
I would guess that this could be done with a daemon and a couple of scripts,
or perhaps some atrun'ed program.  The 1st program would scan all the articles
for the keywords and useraddresses.  It would then append any usernames it
finds that have sent messages with keywords that may indicate a favorable
response to the article to the article's mail list.  The second program would
then take the mail list for each article and remove any names found in the
universal "send-no-mail-to-me" list, and in the "already-sent-to" list.
The resulting list could be fed to perhaps majordomo(?) or just passed to
a mailer along with the text of each article.  The name would then be
thrown in the "already-sent-to" list after the message completed. Perhaps at the bottom of the mailed article we can have some instructions
on subscribing to cypherpunks, or telling this autobomber to put the name
into the "no-send" list.  Perhaps a message to majordomo with "remove
autobomber" or something...
I'd imagine that this would create quite a lot of traffic for toad.com, not
to mention the requirements of huge names lists...  Maybe if the articles
are periodic and are no longer sent after a month, it can help keep the
storage and traffic in check???

recycling here in NYC as car tires need lots of glass :-) you will get fined.
Idiotic, but true.  Also, keep in mind that recycling makes the jobs of
FBI agents much easier... What spook wants to read your paper waste if its

@_subject: Entropy, WNSTORM and steganography 
Thanks for the algorithm... (I didn't find such a beast in my statistics
books, so, I'll use yours as I mentioned earlier...)
Actually when I came up with WNSTORM, I knew nothing about cyphers or
crypts, and had no idea about what PK systems were...  I was a clueless
crypto-virgin...  But somehow the idea snuck into my head that I could
emulate frequency hopping transmissions with a computer, and do it far
better than in the physical world.
Again, by now, you know how WNSTORM works, so for the others on this list
I'll recap....  Basically WNSTORM takes in a byte of plaintext, splits it
into its idividual bits and scatters these bits into a random number window
of variable size.  The random window can be anywhere from 2 bytes to the
limit set by the user.  (WNSTORM.C handles a limit of upto 31 bytes per
rnd window, although chaning a single  would get around this.)
Two arrays are used for this purpose: DataBit[i] and DataByte[i].  DataBit
array contains bit values (ie: 1,2,4,8,16...128.)  These can be moved around.
ie: if DataBit[2]=128, this means that in the current window, what was 2^2 or
bit value 4 in the plaintext is now bit 7 (or bit value 128) in the cyphertext.
However, you also need to look at the DataByte[2] array to see which byte this
actual bit lives in.  If dataByte[2]==7 then our bit is in (stream[2] & 128).
For each plaintext character a window/stream of random numbers is generated.
The size of this channel is determined by a maxchnl variable.  This value
is mod'ed with limitchnl which the user sets.  This is to prevent out of
bounds errors.  The DataBit[] array elements are either swapped, rotated,
interlaced, or otherwise shuffled.  The DataByte array elements are chosen
on each pass based on random values and the passkey.
All these actions are based on some formulas which take in the passphrase
and the previous random number window.  Obviously making a single change in
the cyphertext will cause the total loss of transmission for the rest of
the file...
Now, I did insert a somewhat "smart" statistical bit-fix routine that would
correct changes made by the insertion of the cyphertext bits into the
random number window.  Since any bit can be 1 or 0, there's a 50% chance
that a bit targeted for replacement by a cyphertext bit will change.  The
odds of a whole byte not changing are very slim of course (1/2)^8, however
the bitfix function will for all eight cyphertext bits will try to see if
the target bit was changed.  If it was it will try to find a byte with the
opposite value in another byte.  (ie: if we clear bit 128 in byte four, the
bitfix function may set bit 128 in byte two.)  If the bitfix fails to find
a corresponding free bit in the stream, it will set another free bit of whatever
value it can find.
The bitfix function targets its "victim" bits (ie: those bits in the random
number window which were not replaced by the cyphertext bits) randomly so
that there won't be much of a chance of detecting the changes made by the
bitfix function...
The bitfix function is only used durring encryption.  It makes no difference
for decryption since the algorithm uses the past window of data for the next
commands, so any changes made in the current window won't have any ill
Now, for the purposes of random numbers, the Borland C 3.1's random number
generator is kinda shitty, so I've put in an option to allow WNSTORM to read
random numbers from a device or file.  This would allow an external hardware
device (or device driver) to be hooked into WNSTORM.   This also allows
WNSTORM to be used for steganography.
In a Stego mode, two more programs are needed to interface with WNSTORM.  They
are extractors and injectors.  These are format dependant.  They may either
extract the low bytes of an image, sound, or other media, or if enough data
is available to hide the cyphertext, they may extract the low bit(s) of each
byte in the media...  The injector does the opposite of the extractor.  While
the extractor removes data from the media, the injector will take the cyphertext
output of WNSTORM and inject it back into the media in the same place where
the extraactor removed it.
As an aside, the bitfix function does not use the random device for picking its
victim bits.  The reason for this is that if it did, it would "eat" up data
from a possible stego lsb file which would cause major problems in injecting
the output back in.
Originally I didn't intend for WNSTORM to be used for stego, however, not using
it for stego has a big disadvantage (or two.)  Primarily, it produces
cyphertext that's about 0.5*limitchnl in size.  (ie: many times the size of
the plaintext you wish to send.)  However, using a large window size helps
the security of WNSTORM because fewer bits in the stego file are modified,
so there's less of a chance of detecting the presence of stego...
Another problem with not using it for stego is that you should have a
random number generator in hardware with a device driver to talk to it.  This
is because whatever compiler you use will have a poor random number generator,
whose idiosyncrasies could be sniffed out and compared to the cyphertext
produced by WNSTORM, so it might be possible to sniff out which bits of the
stream are used.
However, these weaknesses aside, I'd like some suggestions for a way of
attacking this algorithm to sniff out more weaknesses.  How would one go
about performing cryptanalysis on a cypher which uses random garbage to
hide and to encrypt?  Certainly chosen plaintext attacks will always fail
because encrypting the same text with the same password 100 times will
produce 100 different cyphertexts...
(Perhaps a good use for this is in cypherpunk anon-encrypted remailers???)
The one attack I devised in WNSTORM's eariler incarnation is now plugged up
(in the previous version I split the plaintext into two halves and hid the
nibbles in the random noise stream.  I also didn't use the random numbers
in the window which were not replaced by cyphertext.  The attack would have
been to do statistics on the nibbles, and also to move the whole cyphertext
into a RAM drive and interatively change one bit, decrypt the text, see if
there's any difference, if there is, the last bit we changed was used. This
could give you a map of the used/unused bits.  Neither of these attacks
will work.)
I realize that I'm still an amateur at cyphers and I'm still learning, so
my attacks on this program will be limited...  So, any of you have any
suggestions?  (I did notice a lack of interest in this... I posted up
announcements for WNSTORM a few weeks ago, and got only two messages from
interested cpunks...  So anyone interested in helping determine the
strength of this cypher?)

In that case one of us (who owns a machine directly plugged into the net)

better yet, provide a bouncing off point for anonymous telnet...  Say
something like you telnet to port 666 on toad.com, and then you're given
an anonymous temporary id.  At that point, you are prompted with a menu for
what to do... telnet to another site, ftp into another side, call an IRC server from somewhere, etc.  All the anon server would have to do
is bounce packets...   I think this idea came up before... an anon packet
forwarding service of sorts...
If a user goes through several of these, s/he is granted pretty decent
anonimity...  Perhaps another play on this would work with encrypted
packets?  Where each user who dials into one of these packet bouncers
talks to it via a PGP like RSA and key-exchange system.
All the IRC server will see is that someone named anon7 logged in from
Of course if the sysadmins who run irc's are true assholes, they'll
blacklist the anons, but if there are enough anon packet bounces
on the network, this will be pretty hard.  They'll just have to recognize
that the right of privacy is one that outweighs their desire to keep
logs.  Granted anon packet bouncers can be used to throw junk mail
or messages thought irc's, but we could install a time delay in the
anon forwarding software so that it can receive quickly, but only send
slowly.  (Slowly enough for one person to type to an IRC, but not for a script

forms of abuse available, but if we could limit one we could

How about publishing them as scantron coded circles with a checksum at the
end.  Granted this will be expensive, but it can be made portable, and
we could also include some decoding software that will do the OCR for you.
Most modern scanners are TWAIN compatible these days..  For those that
are not, we could have the program accept different file formats.  TIFF,PCX,
etc. and have it scan the picture and resolve it into binary in minutes.
We should also include the plaintext versions of the source code in the
same book in a large, clear OCRalble font... say Courier at 14 points.  This
way you are guaranteed that you can get at the sources...
The scantron version could also be compressed to a ZIP file let's say...
Text files compress pretty well, so it shouldn't be a problem, and the book
can include the decoding software.  Would this be exportable?
Do you guys remember those old Commodore program listings that had a checksum
at the end of every line?  We could do the same thing to verify OCR to typos.
If an error occurs, we could go and enter the text or binary pattern in by
Another option is the new 2D barcodes which can store a lot more info than
the regular kind.   Are bar codes on paper exportable?
We could simply include some software to read off the pages with a scanner
and be done with it.
Even so, I'm sure that >SOMEONE< outside the USA would be very willing to
pay a secretary to type in the source code of a book.  :-)  Whatever happened
to the mafias and undergrounds of other countries?  I'd imagine they'd have
the most to gain from crypto software...  Hell, they probably already typed
in all the code in all the crypto books...

About sending bad blocks...  if your receiving party can listen in on the
transmission, you could simply change the program for them to include another
checksum somewhere else in the middle of the block.  Say, packet a has a bad
checksum, then its a candidate for hidden info.. so you check your secret
checksum.  If it matches, you decode the compressed block.
Obviously, your transmitter should send the steggoed data twice due to
possible real errors which would eat your cyphermessage for lunch.  Of course
the repeats would have to look different than the originally sent stegoed
packets or else the warden might get suspicious if he decides to have a look
at the bad packets...

However, they need to achieve goal  first, which means that if they piss off
their users, they won't be able to do much, so the best thing to do is to tell
them outright that we are against any such thing as a software escrow and that
any attempt on their part to use anything but strong, uncompromised crypto will
result in an instant boycott of >ALL< their products, and that we'd rather
switch to Novell's DR DOS or OS/half before use MS Escrow.

a escrow in any of their products, but knowing them, they'd probably
rather use cheap encryption than pay licensing fees unless they can get more
back.  Remember, they run a business, they're not in the business of giving
anything away to Uncle Sam or to Joe Bloe User.

@_subject: What kind of encryption to incorporate? 
Take a look at WNSTORM (WNS210.ZIP) which contains the WNINJECT program.
It, along with WNSTORM can be used to build a decent steganography system
that makes use of existing LSB's to hide the presence of stego.  If you
like, feel free to build a GIF module for it.  (WNINJECT uses PCX right now
and I haven't had the time to mess with GIFs.)
If you guys are seriously interested, I'm more than willing to lend a hand.
You can certainly use WNSTORM and it's tools to build something better (as long
as you give me some credit for the original work. :-)
Basically you first use WNINJECT to extract the LSB's out of a PCX image, then
you feed those LSB's into WNSTORM which encrypts into them but leaves most of
them untouched and doctors some of the bits against statistical analysis)
then you take the output from WNSTORM and WNINJECT's it back into the PCX
giving you a stegoe'd image that closely matches the original and which is
hard to detect that it has a change unless you have the original.

This is the output of the program Medusa's Tentacles.  This isn't

Again, please ignore the 1: stats for now as I have to further investigate
their validity.
Fuzzybase "det" is the collected statistics based on the detweiler
archives collected by Rishab Aiyer Ghosh.
det30 is a portion of that collection, so I'm comparing it with the
collection to see how different a small portion will be when comparing it
to the whole.  This gives a difference level of 0.00025409
suednym is one of the messages Sue sent.  NOTICE that the level of
difference is 0.00021086.  These two "differences" are very very close
when compared to the others.
Autoexec and config.sys are thrown in as sanity checks.  If I got low
numbers on these I'd expect something was terribly wrong.
Weirdly enough TC May's post about the bleak future which includes tons of
paranoid like words matches most of Detweiler's posts more closely than
one of his own messages.   However lets not jump to conclusions here
because Detweiler's own message showed a differences of 0.002... and Sue
matched it.
With this sort of data it's hard to separate the subjects from the authors
from the language.  Language is easy to detect, but two people who
constantly post the same kind of material based on the same subject might
show up with the same difference levels.
Again this is only ONE sample so please no lynching Sue just yet (although
this was already a moot point.)
Remember, Medusa is still under construction.  This is only a preview.
If you'd like to preview the sources/executables to medusa please email me
and I'll somehow get them to you.

Don't know for sure.  That article was a bit too vague as tot he exact
nature of the data vacuuming.  I suspect however that while Computerworld
may be quite vague all by its self, the CIA wasn't too talkative as to
what they'd eat up.  However, you can bet that any TCP/IP packets sent
through their hardware will duplicate themselves on their hard drives.
It's certain that they will eat up usenet news.  They mentioned that the
reason that this system is up is so that they can do research, but in such
a way as to prevent traffic/question analysis of their querries so as to
prevent others from finding out just what they're working on.  Who knows,
maybe they'll get accounts on internet providers or use anon mail to post
their querries, but "They're here!"
I certainly wouldn't put it past them to read any email they can though. :-(

Your chip-mania is lunacy... Let's try a new lens...
Q2,'95, PPC 604 in machines, chip costs around $400 at 100MHz.
Q4,'95  P6 in machines, chip costs around $1100 at 133MHz.
        PPC 604 matches P6 performance (or betters it) with
        133MHz and 150MHz versions. 100MHz version is $250.
        Developers routinely recompiled Win32 apps for PPC.
        PPC 620 shipping in quantity. Initial price, $999.
        AMD K5 variants and Cyrix M1 variants begin really annoying
        Intel by matching all P5 performance points with lower         prices. The ensuing price war begins chopping away something
        from Intel's gargantuan profits.
Q1,'96  P6 machines now available in quantity. Few willing to pay
        the high price. Really fast P5s keep those not looking for
        change quite happy. Some, looking for price/performance,
        begin thinking about PPC machines.
Q2,'96  PPC620 machines ship. Faster 604s, P5s, P6s, abound. Nothing
        can touch 620 in the PC marketplace. Machines expensive.
        PPC604 chip price now at about $150. P6 at about $750.
Q4,'96  Word of the PowerPC 800 series just swept Comdex (IBM and Moto
        did a big show on the new series). Systems should begin appearing
        in 12-18 months.
        Intel cloners becoming really annoying. IBM, making money selling
        PPC systems, also has figured out what Intel already knows: you
        can make more money selling whole logic boards to PC cloners rather
        than just chips. Using Cyrix technology, they are cutting deeper into
        the P5-class x86 business.
        Intel/HP briefing ignored. Who cares about a chip coming out in two
        years?
        Gateway and Dell merge but keep identities separate.         HP again considers buying Apple.
Q2,'97  Intel fights back with much cheaper P6s and much faster ones.
        First PPC 800 series silicon is becoming available.
Q4,'97  PPC running 800 SPECint.
Q2,'98  Intel/HP first silicon using VLIW technology. Compatible with
        existing x86 binaries. Intel encouraging ISVs to write to the
        "native mode" of the new chips, though.
That was fun....
IBM's PPCs will have preemption, threads, telephony, video, etc. (as soon
as they ship). Macs will have threads, telephony, video, etc. (as soon as
7.5 ships). I don't think lack of preemption will kill, or even severely
wound, Apple's efforts to keep -- and perhaps increase -- its market
share. Also, that PnP stuff and multimedia will still be better on Macs

@_subject: CEB 8 - WNSTORM Info 
WNSTORM is available from:
Usual routine to get it. i.e. cd /pub/crypto/software, get the README
file, and if you agree to the terms then follow the instructions.
Short description off the top of my head (I wrote the beastie)  Another
info scrap should be in the same directory as WNSTORM.
WNSTORM is a data encryption/steganography utility which is pretty secure for
most uses.  Unlike some stego systems WNSTORM is expandible, all you have to
do is write your own LSB injector/extractor for whatever data format you wish
to hide information into.
WNSTORM doesn't require the recipient of the host picture, sound, movie, etc.
to have the original un-stormed picture.  Unlike primitive stego programs,
WNSTORM doesn't compare an stormed picture with an unstormed picture.
WNSTORM will cover its tracks statistically.  If it changes a 0 bit in the
LSB data stream to a zero, or a 1 bit to a 1, it does nothing.  If it changes
a 1 bit to a zero, it will balance itself by changing an unused adjacent 0
bit to a 1.  Ditto for a 0->1 transform.
WNSTORM will NOT change every bit of the LSB in order to prevent detection.
It will use a passkey along with a probabilistic algorithm to decide which
bits it will change.  The algorithm for picking bits depends on the previous
succesfully encoded/decoded cyphertext AND the passkey.
Internally WNSTORM works by picking "windows" or "packets" of bytes out of
either a random number stream or an LSB stream extracted from a picture,
sound, movie, etc.  It then injects eight bits of cyphertext into this window.
Each window is of variable size.  The bit locations where the bits are inserted
are randomly exchanged for each pass.  The bit values are also randomly exchanged for each pass.
WNSTORM includes an injector/extractor for PCX images, however I will write
more injecotr/extractor programs for it in the future, and OTHERS can do so
as well.

@_subject: Strategies for getting encryption in widespread use QUICKLY 
I'm currently developing a Mac BBS.  (I don't know when I'll finish it
but I've been working on it for the last 3 years!)  I can put
patches in to connect to whatever crypto terms will be out there,
however, on the Mac, it's far easier to simply build a CommToolbox
connection tool which ANY Mac BBS or Mac terminal could interface
itself with.
The BBS would have to specifically know about the encryption tool
as it would need to link some key to a user...  But other than
that, the ability is already there.
If we come up with a standard for encoded TCP/IP and serial
communications and adapt existing programs to use them....
The serial communications would be much easier I suspect as most
unix machines can simply have device drivers written for them that
map an existing port to/from an encryption pipe and on to a
virtual device.   Ie: for every /dev/tty* you could have /dev/etty*
It'll be harder for DOS, but not impossible.  If anyone has the
sources to a fossil driver, there are plenty of BBS software that
use the fossils... Perhaps there would be some term programs that
do this too?
On Amiga????
(BTW: I've put off the Mac BBS for a while as I just stumbled on
something far more important: a crypto-stacker for the Mac!!!  I
hope to get something up in beta in the next few months.  I won't
do the actual encryption routines, but will provide plenty of hooks
for adding your own. I'm going to have it actually compress/decompress
and have some hooks...)

Look at the code for Layers and Multisession(??) they both have sources
for the unix end.  If you base your code on that it should be fairly
stable as we know the above products work.  (Beware of Layers though,
on the Unix end, it supposedly leaves opened ports after you log out
which could be used to hack in, or look like they were used to hack in.
I got my account pulled one day for running it, because some hackers were
breaking in and leaving open ports as part of their footprints....)
If you're going to do this, try to write some VERY generic code. Don't
assume the size of a char, int, long, etc.  Instead, use stuff like:
 CHAR char
 INT int
etc.  That way, if an int happens to be 32 bits on some weirdo machine,
it can be redefined on that machine by simply modifying the headers...
(better yet, use typedef, not Another thing, don't use any dos i/o functions to actually send the
packets across, instead, do everything you can without calling on DOS
or whatever C language library/compiler calls directly.  Call the DOS
functions to read/write to the serial port from one single place so
that they can be easily modified.
You really don't have to do too much for the packets and stuff...
Basicallly each packet is composed of a header, data, and some
sort of check.  There are CRC codes out there already.  Pull the
32 bit version out of some Zmodem program and use that...
Your header should contain some packet id the size of the packet
(no need to send 1024 bytes if the user just pressed one key :-),
the CRC for the packet, and the packet itself...  A good thing might
also be to include a couple of special bytes at the begining and end
of the packet so that the receiver can try to resynch itself if it
gets hit by line noise...  Say, 0x55,0x55,0xAA,0xAA, packetid
packetsize, packetcrc, packet, 0x00,0x00,0xff,0xff for example.
(while this is longer, the other side can look for 2 zeroes, followed
by two 255's, followed by possibly some time before it sends a
request to resend the packet.
Or if you want to make things simpler, do as Xmodem (yuck!) send
a small tiny header, the packet, and wait for an ACK from the other
side before proceeding to send the next packet.  That ACK would be
after/before a packet that the other side sends of course... :-)
Better yet, maybe you can just hack some source code for SLIP or
UUCP or something...

Hey guys I posted this message all over AOL, CIS, Fido and UseNet.  I'd
like to post it on here as well.  If you happen to know someone who has
written disk drive device drivers for the mac, please forward this to
them so that I can write something like SecureDrive for the Mac. :-)
(I've already written some vastly cool, vastly portable code thatprovides
much much more than an encrypted drive!)  I will make a FREE no-frills
crypto-drive available (only in the USA of course...) but there will
also be something along the lines of a shareware crypto-stacker with
data compression and encryption.  I've written most of the compressor
related code already, and tried to keep it fairly portable...  This
should give eDisk, Stacker, and x2 a bit of healthy competition. :-)
(It will be VERY low cost compared to them.)
Hey there, I tried to get a printed copy of InsideMac:Devices, however it
won't be published for a while.  In the mean time, I printed out some of
the relevent chapters from the beta version on the   d e v e l o p
bookmark cd...
I'm trying to write a disk device driver that will be loaded from an
application (after the Mac is started up, and INITs have loaded.)  I
already have code that installs a driver in this manner.  I've looked at
the SCSI C/ASM sample code on the CD...  But, here are some questions I
still have:
Is it okay for my driver to call FSRead FSWrite from its Prime routine?
(It will be reading from a file or writing to a file.)
Do I have to make the driver asynchronous?  If not, how do I tell the OS
that it isn't async?  If yes (or if asynch is better) how do I write such
a beast?  The demo SCSI driver is synchronous, however I hear that the new
AV macs use asynch drivers.  Would an async driver work on older Macs?
Would a non-async driver work on an AV Mac?
Where can I get sample code for an Async disk driver?  All I need is
basically a bit of a source code skeleton that I can stick in
READ_A_BLOCK, WRITE_A_BLOCK, Initialize, and Shutdown functions...
Also, a MAJOR thing, how do I set the sector/block size of a disk device
driver such as the one I'm writing?  I understand that 512 bytes seems to
be the size in general.  I also understand that the Mac clusters sectors
together if the drive is larger than 65535 sectors because of the pointers
it uses.   (I'd like to be able to use 512, 1024, 4096, or even upto 32K
sectors in my driver, but if 512 is the normal it's not too big a deal...)
I have written most of the routines that this driver needs, but I need a
working, good skeleton of a driver, and as the warnings on the SCSI sample
code indicate, I don't trust it. :-)

@_subject: Mailing list software losing posts 
Why bother with something as obvious and complex as an encrypted
address with a + in the middle.  If I were Joe Foreign_Guy I would
simply get an account somewhere in the USA, there are plenty of
public access unix systems that allow you a free month or so,
do the request for the crypto software, and immediatly put a .forward file in my directory.  I do this because I can no longer
support the high price of calling the USA, and thus want my mail
sent to a machine on the net that is sitting on my desk here in
sunny (insert_foreign_country).  This way, the author has not broken the law by sending the software
to anysite.com, and I haven't either because all I did was to tell
the unix box to forward my mail out of the country.  Such a setting
isn't illegal, neither is sending crypto software via email to a USA site.
Legally who is to blame?  Neither "I" nor the sender broke the law
although the software has been sent.  If I move from the USA to
another country and arrange a deal with my post office to send me
ALL my mail to wherever I am and pay them in advance for the
service plus agree to pay for whatever forwarding costs, who is to
be blamed if Joey_CryptoAuthor sends me a disk with a ton of
crypto software in an unlabled box, and the Post Office does not
check its contents, but exports it?
Neither I nor Joey_CryptoAuthor broke ITAR.  Not really.  Not
intentionally.  But who gets blamed?

that much easier for the bad guys to intercept and find what

The less standard a stego program is, the safer.  Rolling your own

@_subject: clipper pin-compatible chip 
Here's an idea right out of the Intel-Cyrix-AMD wars.
Once the clipper chips are common place, perhaps we could get some company
to build IDEA chips that are pin compatible with the clipper chip itself,
and perhaps even some switching socket where if you're calling a device
and want to use the clipper chip (due to compatibility reasons of course)
you activate the clipper chip socket.  If not, you flip the switch the other
way, and activate the IDEA chip.
All we need are pinout, timing/signal specs and a few cypherpunks who are/were
EE majors. :-)
The chip switching mechanism itself is no big deal.  In the worse case
we could adopt an Atari/Nintendo type solution where you have a socket
for a plug in cartridge which contains the encryption chip of your choice.
You then call up your friend and tell him to use his IDEA cart and you
do the same.  Or RSA, or anything you like.
If we could convince hardware manufactures to include chip sockets, this
won't be an issue any longer.
Which would Joe Bloe using a celular phone prefer?  The clipper chip when
he knows any spook can listen to him, or a third party IDEA chip which
is quite secure?
The IDEA cartridge could have some rotary switches with numbers on them
to set for a 128 bit key.  Sort of like the push button SCSI device ID
selectors on external cases.  Perhaps the cartridge might even have a touch tone like keypad for typing in a pass phrase.... etc.   This could
be done quite cheaply.  Hell, you could probably just use a 68000 a ROM
and a say 64K of RAM and not need a special IDEA chip.

@_subject: REMAIL: Cover traffic 
Why can't the remailers themselves send encrypted mail to each other totally
masking the incoming messages?
Each remailer can have a public/private key associated with every other
remailer on the network, with full pgp type signatures to prove they
came from a remailer and not a spook or nym?
Each remailer has a fingerable public key.  When remailer x sends a message
to remailer y, it encrypts it with y's public key after fingering y, and
also signs the message.
Y could also be a paranoid remailer, and if it doesn't know X, it could tell
it to go stick its message up its SCSI port. :-)
All these ideas along with trash junk mail being sent every few minutes
could work.  Even better, have each remailer send a specific number of
messages to each of the other remailers on the network.  These messages
would be bogus messages, however, there would be a fixed number of them.
If a real nym message arrives, it is sent to the next mailer up the chain,
as part of the n (n-1 now) that are bogus.  That way a spook couldn't tell
where a message was going since he couldn't count the number of messages
going out of the mailer.  Also if a target remailer has n real messages to be sent to, any messages
over that assigned packet size of messages get spooled for the next round
of bogus mail.  This way each remailer will send exactly n messages to

Actually, even if the clipper chip is limited to 10 bytes plus a 3 byte
checksum of sort, even if it's 10 bits it doesn't matter.
What you'd plug in the socket could have it's own CPU, and key
database, or even a plug in keypad of sorts to type in whatever key
you want.  You don't necessarily have to use the clipper requested
key.  A key of all 1's or 0's would be great, infact, it would be better
than great, it would be an indicator that the key is elsewhere, etc.
This plug in chip could have extra pins which don't plug into the
clipper chip socket, but rather go to another board layer which would
keep a database of encrypted keys and some way to access those keys with
a passphrase.

Actually, all you need to know is what pins do what, and what the protocol
of those pins are in terms of their communication with the rest of the
My suggestion was to make a plug in chip that replaced the clipper
chip, however, that chip doesn't need to actually be able to talk to
another clipper chip.  You don't need to disassemble a real clipper
chip to be able to do that.
In order for Uncle Sam to be able to spread the clipper and not
give AT&T any idea about what it actually contains, it has to give
AT&T some interface specs.   It has to provide this information to
any company that intends to use the clipper chip.
Just as you don't need to know the microcode for an Intel 486 to
build a clone, you don't need to know what the guts of the clipper are
to replace it with another chip which doesn't have to be compatible with it in terms of communicating with another clipper.  It should
rather only need to communicate with another of its kind be it an
IDEA chip or an RSA chip, etc.
All things considered, a simplified approach at looking at a clipper
would be that of a filter or a pipe.  Data goes in at one end, some
other data goes out the other end.  All you need to do to replace it
with another filter that does a similar (but not identical) job is to
find how the clipper talks to the outside world, which Uncle Sam
has to provide if he wants this chip to take off the ground.  In which
case, once we have specs, we can build an interface to an IDEA chip, etc.
Another example: with old old Macintoshes there was a thing called a
"Killy Clip" which looked like a laundry pin that attached over a 68000
CPU and took over its bus to an accelerator card, or some other system
expansion card.  Such things were originally frowned upon by Apple and
mostly Steve Jobs, but they were popular at the time.  They worked.
And they didn't need to take the 68000 apart to the silicon.  Just
attached to its pins and took over from there.
Couldn't the same thing be done with Clipper?
A pin compatible, bus-protocol compatible, but communications
incompatible chip attached to a switch that lets you select between the clipper and the replacement?

@_subject: PC Expo summary!! 
I agree.  However, I was severely pressed for time, and this was the best
resource I could find that dealt with most of the issues dealing with Clipper.
I don't think it made anarchist==cypherpunk, though granted some folks would
take it that way.  Certainly a cypherpunk is nothing more than somone who
uses crypto for his privacy and demands strong crypto. However the transcript
did offer a lot of information as to what the uses are both legal and illegal
and what the dangers of weak crypto & clipper.
I did ask around for beginners articles & was told to write some up myself.
I would have, had I not been pressed for time.  As I said in the pc-expo
summary, I had to write lots of software, and weed though about 900 files that
I captured off this list to see what I can use.  None of them had as much raw
info as this file.  In the heading to this file, I did write "Please forgive
the political slant of this file and instead look at the info it provides"
or something like it.  While that won't really make much different for those
who'd say "Damn anarchists," it made me feel better. :-)
This wasn't my original intention, but unless someone (even myself) writes
a nice big text file on all the issues from clipper, to rsa, to patents to
pgp to even Tempest and IR face scans at the airport, this was the best resource
I could find.  Even Tim wasn't able to help out.   I had little choice.  IT
was either include this file and offend some readers, or don't include it and
leave them clueless.  Which would you rather had me do?
Now keep in mind that about 30% of the disk receivers will never see any
articles because of my big mistake in the installation script, and the rest
will figure out how to get it, or won't be interested so they won't see it...
You obviously can sell someone a copy of it.  You wrote it, it's under your
copyright more than the cypherpunks.  You have to keep in mind that the visuals
of this disk were to make it look like some big corporation was putting out
demo software. Not a bunch of loosely connected folks who know each other
only via email (mostly anyway.)  Putting a copyright notice on it certainly
brings this out more.  Also the title of the disk wasn't "Cypherpunks Disks"
it was "Data Security & Privacy\n A Free Software Demo"  In small letters
it stated that PGP & SecureDevice & WNS were on the disk.
I also put "For demo/educational uses only" and "NOT FOR EXPORT"  All this
lends itself to look professional rather than freewareish.  I'll send ya
a copy of the disk if you like; you'll see that the installer program is also
of the "professional" look & feel.  Or at least as much as I could make it
look professional in the short time that I had.
Nope. Not unless you're in the phone book.  The random cooks could be
press folks as I did give out quite a few copies to them.  So try & find out
if they are or not.  If anything, you can tell'em I did the disk and give'em
my work number (212-412-8475) and I'll deal with them.
The only thing referring to you was your name.  I don't think I even included
your email address... I did include "for more info, send email to cypherpunks@
toad.com" and told them how to subscribe and to expect tons of email if they
do.  I didn't even put my address on it.  My name is only on the copyright
notices of the installer, menu, and file viewer programs.  I didn't put my
email address\, nor phone number, nor anything else except my name on the disk.
As far as copyright is concerned, while we are just a "mailing list" we can
also be thought as an organization.  We are "organized" and our address is
only on the internet.  The method of organization is anarchy.  None the less
we aren't any less of an organization than any other.  We just don't operate
in the same way IBM or MicroSoft, or EFF or EPIC does.  Does that mean we
can't copyright stuff in the cypherpunks name?  I don't know, I'm not a lawyer
and I agree with you that it probably wouldn't hold true infront of a copyright judge or a copyright lawyer.  None the less, it was put there for
effect and it did its job for effect, not for copyright.
If you want to sell the disk, you can't, except for the cost of duplicating
the disk. ie: user groups, etc.  If you want to sell your speech, you can.
It's yours and nobody claims any copyright owenership to it.  If Dave Mandl
wants to sell it, he too can. :-)  Now I wouldn't be able to sell it and I
haven't, and neither can any cypherpunk on this list.   Again the disk itself
is copyrighted as a collection.  I didn't claim that cypherpunks had ownership
of PGP, WinPGP, WNSTORM, SecureDevice, or the articles.  Infact a lot of the
Wired articles were on it (with their own copyright notices of course.)  If
the Libertarians want to "Sell" copies of the transcript I guess they could if
it were okay with you and Dave.
(For those of you unfamiliar with a collection copyright, it's basically a
copyright on a collection of things that are either copyrighted or public
domain (if they're copyrighted, they can still be distributed, but that
strongly depends on the real owner of the copyright.)  If someone else takes
the same collection of files and sells it, he is violating the collection
Now all this aside, I doubt that I'd actually go and sue PC Magazine for
selling the disks at $100 a pop.  Of course the guy getting his hands on the
disk might notice he was had, but that's another thing.

None mathematically.  A friend of mine (denaro09 at darwin.poly.edu) has an
interesting thought on this.  If the NSA does have any method of screwing
RSA in any way, it's probably optimized for the common key lengths for PGP.
ie: 512, 1024, etc.  So he uses a 1023 bit key.  That one bit less may be
unsecure for him, but the idea is still sound.  Maybe a 1025 bit key would
give them less of an advantage.  Even so this is all speculation.  We don't
know what the NSA knows...

Please, call me Ray. :-)  Nevermind what Poly tells ya. :-)
I thank you, although there is room for criticism. :-)  I did screw up a couple
of things as I did mention earlier.  But at least now there's a precedent so
that others elsewhere can do the same thing, and will be able to do it
without that bug.
Agreed, but I had little else that would make as much of a difference.
Yes, quite true.  At that time I was working part time and had a lot of spare
time to work with.  I was basically collecting posts from the lists which I
would consider using.  Come May however, my free time dropped to almost zero.
Again, this is nothing but hindsight, but what's done is done.  Let's hope
for the best result.
Again, PC Expo was Tuesday.  I finished the disk between Sunday and Monday.
I barely had enough time to put the stuff that I did manage to put on the
disk.  I didn't have time to clip quotes out of articles though I intended
to do so.  However Wired's articles on the Cypherpunks & Clipper were very
handy and did make their way on the disk. Most of my bitching was directed to those punx who volunteered then backed
out.  Sorry if this wasn't clear.  Yes, there were plenty of articles, but
I did not have them all available to me.  All in all, the Wired articles and
the Transcript were the best of the crop.  The others were tidbits of sorts
and didn't quite fit in as the Uncypherpunk's Manual to Cypherpunk issues.
:-)  I asked you for material because A) You wrote tons of it, B) I was
hoping you had some around which you could forward to me, or C) you had
or would have written something ; D) which I asked was if you could mosh
something together as you mention further on..
This wasn't a "Tim, he didn't help out at all."  You did, I did have some of your posts on the disk; but not much in terms of what was needed.
But perhaps some will use it anyway, even if they have qualms about the
transcript. :-)  Let's hope that in the least it helped spread PGP a bit
further. Which I would have if I had the time or the foresight to start such an article
ahead of time instead of thinking I had captured enough from the list.  I
perhaps will do so for future disks, etc.  Again, I know you are busy and
would not have asked if I wasn't under a lot of time stress..
Well what did you want me to do with those who were interested?  Not put
any sort of contact info on there whatsoever?  Certainly the copyright
on that particular transcript may be misleading, but are Perry and Dave
non-cypherpunks?  Well, never mind, I'm painting myself in a corner here.
Certainly, Dave and Perry own the copyright to this. I conceeded that point
many a time.
What's wrong with "cypherpunks at toad.com?"  I certainly send messages to that
address, and get replies, even if I write from a different machine because
most folks will do a cc:cypherpunks to a reply, so their reply goes to both
cypherpunks and the email address of the person they're responding to.
I certainly wouldn't be upset about Debbie Does Fort Meade. :-)  Nonetheless
it was a speech given by two cypherpunks.  If someone in an organization does
something you dislike, it doesn't pull him out of that organization necessarily
and again, the transcript was labeled "Crypto-anarchy" with a blurb about
"cypherpunks Perry Metzger & Dave Mandl" at least that was on the flyer which
announced the meeting.
I disagree that we shouldn't put copyright notices on future diskettes
simply because of appearances which I mentioned in the post to Perry.  I
strongly feel that putting a shitty looking diskette with out making it look
professional will hurt more than help.  As you've said, since we're not quite
that organized, we are shielded from some government problems, but putting
a copyright notice in the cypherpunks name doesn't really expose us to
any problems as there is no real organization to the cypherpunks.
We can certainly explore this point further.
I agree that you've done lots and I've done some, and others have pitched
in.  But out of all the 700 cpunx on the list or whatever majordomo will
report, what percetange have sat on our asses and done nothing?  If you
have written and worked, I do not believe that you would think my diatribes
were aimed at you.  Granted I did mention your name, but I did not imply
you were not doing enough.  I stated that you were "unable" to help, and
that was in the context of the PC Expo project.  That doesn't reflect any
other work you've done for other projects.
Anyway, I was damned stressed out and am sure that when others will scrutinize
the whole disk, byte for byte, and my actions they may find other glitches.
If I have put you on the spot, it was not intentional.  I'm still a bit
burned out from that two day marathon of completing the disk.  I was far
more concerned with getting more folks to get off their asses and do something
than pointing the finger at others for my shortcommings.
I DO hope that all "bugs" (be they software, or wetware) involved in this
project won't hurt future projects.  Perhaps by the time the next Expo will
occur, you'd have finished the FAQ and it would be useful for it.  Too bad
Dickweiler turned psycopath before finishing a decent FAQ.
One word of advice for the future my droogs:  If you write something spiffy,
please consider allowing me and anyone else who might do an Expo raid to use
your articles.  And perhaps we can write more magazine style articles than
just argue over the finer points of a thread.  I can include threads, yes,
but there are always imbeciles who have qualms about having their words
appear elsewhere.  I don't agree with them, but I have to respect their
wishes.  If you'd ease up a bit, your words will do a far greater service.
And for the rest of you, find out if there's any Expos around your town and
join in the raids.  I'll be glad to help you put together a disk, etc.  Even
if your town doesn't have Expos, see if you could give out the disks to
local user groups, or organizations who would be interested, but may not
be aware of PGP et al.

However, I don't seem to have heard from any cypherpunk who felt it was out
of place to put "cypherpunks" on it rather than just you and Perry.  Okay,
so Tim did complain, but I don't take his complaint to be "Oh my god! You've
made me out to be an anarchist" ;-)  So if anyone does have a cow, would he or
she please let me know?  This has been a public service request. :-)
Actually as far as the PC Expo disks are concerned anyone whose articles
weren't on the disk, who didn't contribute anything, and is pissed has no
say in the matter, so I guess other than the few names that made it on the
But lets not look the obvious.  Perhaps some members of the "underground"
received that disk and were very happy with it?  Perhaps it turned some
anal folks over to the other side?  Anything is possible.  Still perhaps
there will be better materials for the next expo.   Personally I don't find
anything wrong with the transcript.  I enjoyed your speech, and you both
did a fine job at outlining the real legal and fuzzy uses for crypto and
that is a whole lot more honest that what's been spewing out of the NSA
and FBI.  Even if someone didn't agree with all the uses, after reading that
piece he certainly is at least aware of them.  Right?
The only other place it went was on the PC EXPO disk.  As for blaming the others
for your words, I'd say they should be proud of such blame, and if they object
why have I not heard from them yet?  Certainly I do not think that Tim
would object to being called a crypto-anarchist, other than Perry he's the only
one I've really heard complain about the copyright.
So then I did do well to place a "NOT FOR SALE" tag on the file.

register int retval=0;
 if (a & 1) retval++;
 if (a & 2) retval++;
 if (a & 4) retval++;
 if (a & 8) retval++;
 if (a & 16) retval++;
 if (a & 32) retval++;
 if (a & 64) retval++;
 if (a & 128) retval++; return retval;
This function, (if you have a decent compiler) will be turned into about 32
instructions at most.  IE:
  MOV BL,00
  MOV AL,value_of_a_wherever_that_may_be_in_the_stack
  AND AL,01
  JZ   INC BL
  AND AL,02
  JZ   ad compiler nausea.
Simple, no shifting, no adding, no dividing, and best of all, it's straight
forward, and you don't have the possibility of sneaking in bugs.  Whereas
the previous example is a one liner, and may be shorter, it will be far
harder for humans to understand. :-)

There.  On a 6502, this too would take about 5 bytes per test * 8 tests, that's
40 bytes.  So that's about 60 bytes or so maximum for this function.  Now for

LEA A0,[address_of_parameter_b_from_stack]
MOVE.B [A0],D0
MOVE.B D0,D2
ANDI BEQ [skip three instructions]
ADDI MOVE.B D2,D0

will run faster.
Now granted on certain machines the XOR method is faster, but is it more
obvious?  I've seen lots of "cool" code in my time.  The verdict on it is
that while it's neato whiz bang cool, it's hard to debug or update if it
needs fixing, and tends to be very non obvious.  If you use a good compiler
which has register optimization, the function done the long way will be
as fast as the XOR method, and cleaner, and in some cases actually faster.

@_subject: Request: tamper-proofing executables 
There isn't any foolproof way.  The reason is that if you protect a program
through software, the hacker, if determined and of exceptionally high caliber
will turn to hardware.
I have a friend of mine who was in Russia a few years back while they were
trying to clone their own PC's.  One great method of debugging such home
made Russian brand machines was to use one computer to debug another computer.
How?  Somple.  You shut down the clock on one machine, let it execute one
instruction, then use the other computer to look at the memory of the
machine being debugged.  The debugger can modify memory or read memory.  It
would then execute one or many instructions on the debugged CPU by strobing
the clock.  I believe they even had a way of grabbing the current registers
on the target CPU via interrupts.  (ie: a hardware interrupt that points to
a ROM routine which then stores the current registers to some memory which is
not normally available to the program running on the debugged CPU except
when it is activated by the debugger CPU.)
Simpler schemes if I may point them out include the ISEPIK cartrige and its
ilk on Commodore 64 machines.  Infact I may point out that the Commodore128
which could emulate a C64 had a built in debugger which when the machine was
reset would let you look at most of the memory from a running C64 program! Now
some memory would be lost, granted, but a determined hacker could find a way
to get at it and create an image which could be restored later.
(Infact the C128 debugger was so good that GEOS 1.2 could be hacked with it!)
A lot of the earlier Activision games could be restarted by a simple SYS
call to one of the usual locations.  Usually restarting the computer and loading
a debugger did the trick.  With the C128, this was even easier.
Some UPS cards have the feature of saving the RAM of the currently running
machine to the drive because of a power failure.  This is evident in
notebook computers though they keep it in RAM.

@_subject: Bit counting 
Again, if its speed you want, you can't beat look up tables no matter how
hard you try.
A 256 byte table will work just fine, and it's four add statements with
possibly a shift, but the shift too can be bypassed.  Observe:
int bitcount(long *value)
 char *c;
 c=(char *) value; // convert long pointer to a char pointer.
 return table[c[0]]+table[c[1]]+table[c[2]]+table[c[3]];
The above may be slightly less efficient than a XOR, ADD and SHIFT operation
that the original function showed, however this is CPU dependant.
For a 16 bit:
int bitcount(int *value)
 char *c;
 c=(char *) value;
 return table[c[0]]+table[c[1]];
This will kick the ass of that call, because there's a single add and only
two memory fetches.
Further, for a single byte, you can implement this as a macro function which
gets rid of all the overhead:
 bitcount(value) table[value]
Granted, this wastes memory, but it depends on whether you're willing to trade
clarity for speed.  The three above functions assume lots of things about the
bit size and such, yes, but that's not the point.  They are CLEAR in their
functionality, and FAST.  The eight line function I showed is also clear in
functionality, but is slower.
Personally I'd rather have clarity than speed.  I'm not interested in breaking
cyphers as much as I am in writing them, so brute force isn't something I'd
look to using.
I've seen far too much weird code in my time to want to use that "simple"
ADD/XOR/SHIFT function.  As "simple" as it seems, there are alternatives.  IF
you want a really high speed method of counting bits, do it in hardware with
a dedicated chip and shove it up the parallel port or directly on the machine's
bus.  If you're trying to break cyphers, you will undoubtedly do this.  If you
are not, it's far safer to write clean, clear, precise understandable code
which won't require a second or thrid glance even with comments.
(That of course is how this got started in the first place... the Cray
Opcode that did this. :-)

@_subject: Request: tamper-proofing executables 
This is as useful as writing your own PCode interpreter and encrypting the
PCode as it runs.  Whoop de doo. :-)  You can still get at the actual
interpreter and copy it along with the key and along with the code it is
executing it.  It's a simple thing.  Capture it in memory, save the memory
image to the disk, write some code to reload it, and restart it again.
There's no way to do this securely without hardware.  Optionally if you had
smart drives, that is disk drives with their own CPU and RAM, you could
make it very hard to defeat this by loading a program in the drive's CPU
which would run in sync with the actual program and spit out consecutive
encrypted sequences or issue challenge numbers and check them against the
previous number.  This makes it hard because now you have to hack two
devices.  Offers more protection than a single program doing this, but it
is still not foolproof.
The best thing to do is to build a custom CPU with custom RAM and seal it in
some epoxy with self destructive materials in it.  This is excruciatingly
cumbersome, and you have to deal with the problem of heat dissipation. (Since
the CPU is a custom made one, you can't simulate it or break it.  Since you
have no access to RAM, you can get RAM images, etc.)
Another alternative is to use a hardware key generator dongle.  But if the
hacker finds the algorithm and the key for this device, and it can be done
by probing it, he can simulate it in software.  Fer instance, if the program
accesses it via the operating system instead of direct I/O on the CPU, a
routine can be written to emulate this box in software.  For protected mode
CPU's with virtual ports, even doing direct I/O will fail....
There's always a way around everything but the most excruciatingly painful
At best you can devfeat mediocre hackers and viruses attempting to screw with
your code...
At worst you can have lots of headaches trying to implement an overly secure
system when it isn't always called for.
Unless your program is some super duper new tech thing and you don't want
people to disassemble and reverse engineer it, don't bother with anything
more than a simple CRC and a bit of encryption...

A: If I didn't think that someone on this list would enjoy it, find it of
   use or interest, I wouldn't have posted it.  While I realize that not
   everyone is like me, I also realize that it is likely that others share
   the same interests as I do, or else we wouldn't be on this list.
2. "I've seen it before"
A: Great, then you don't have to read it.
3. "You should just put pointers up to the original article"
A: The original article may be on usenet.  Not everyone has access to usenet
   though they have access to internet mail.  Not everyone who has access to
   usenet has access to the particular newsgroup the message/article was posted
   in.  Not everyone who has access to the particular newsgroup will get to
   see the particular article because some systems will have a short delete
   time and by the time they find out about the article, it will be gone.
   At this point, if they're only mildly interested, they'll give up, if they're
   really interested, they will ask for the message to be sent to them out
   of someones benevolance.  Not everyone will have copies of it, not everyone
   will bother to send the message.
   Forwarding messages to the list has the advantage that anyone who might be
   interested will be able to receive it.
4. "I dislike forwarded messages so much I'm going to bitch about them until
    you stop posting them."
A:  You're an asshole with nothing better on your hands.  If you dislike wasting
    time and bandwidth why do you post complaints about it?  Why do you waste
    your time and the time of those who want to see the article, or the time
    of those who do not wish to see your rantings?  Experience tells me that
    the bitching replies to an "offending" message usually will last for a
    long time, generating far more bandwidth waste, not contain anything
    remotely on topic, and annoy the fuck out of the whole list.  So just
    because you are annoyed and like to bitch doesn't mean you should force
    the whole list to listen to your rantings.
    Besides, even if you do botch, 99.99999% of the readers will simply ignore
    your rants, or delete them on sight without reading more than the subject.
I like the idea of having a cypherpunks-fwd subgroup.  This way the assholes
on this list who only complain won't have to subscribe to it.. I will tolerate
off topic messages and I don't have a problem with hitting the delete key.
I will tolerate seeing things I've seen before and won't bitch about them
either.  But when someone calls my messages off topic be they mine or be they
forwards, all I need to is look at all the messages on the list to find the
same ones that I'd ignore and stick the nose of the accuser in them.  This
will usually shut them up quickly and silence their ridiculous rantings.
Post and let post.  If you don't like it, don't read it.  Thems by two
electrons. :-D

It's obvious that the government is trying to suppress all knowledge that

I remember my crypto professor going over this as part of the last week of our
crypto class.  Somehow, there was a snag using RSA, and if I remember correctly
he used a model where both sides share the same N value.  He ran across some
P and Q prime values where this didn't work, but with a shared modulus for
both players, it did work.
Bruce Schneier's book didn't mention this snag, so either that was an error,
or there's something else we overlooked durring the simulation.  (This was a
blackboard simulation, not a computer simulation, but it failed with some
small numners... :-)

@_subject: Card Playing Protocol? 
What I suggest you do is you build something that can be telnetted into.
Say, something that would sit on a specific telnet port that people can telnet
into.  When they do, another copy of the poker (or whatever game) process is
forked into existence, and all of these processes can talk to each other
to pass on the deck encrypted in some form or other.
  You have to use a cypher which allows each card to be doubly encrypted and
decrypted without decrypting both encryptions:
  1.  Card encrypted by player 1:   E1(Card,eK1)
  2.  Card encrypted by player 2:   E2(Card,eK2)
  3.  Card encrypted by player 1, then encrypted by player 2:
                                    E2(E1(Card,eK1),eK2)
Now, whatever you do, player one must be able to decrypt his encryption from
step 3 above.  That is he should be able to take: E2(E1(Card,eK1),eK2) and
decrypt it with his key giving E2(Card,eK2) as follows:
      D1(E2(E1(Card,eK1),eK2),dK1) = E2(Card,eK2)
Where E1(card,key1) means encrypted by Player 1 with his key, and eK1 means
Player 1's encryption key; D1() means decrypt by player 1 with his decryption
key dK1, etc.
You can take any cypher you like and make it into a random number generator
by putting it in a feedback mode which doesn't encrypt, but rather just
generates numbers (I forgot the name of this mode, but it's one of the DES
modes that's commonly used for communications which is immune to noise.) This
mode is built so that both sides use this sort of generator and simply XOR
the plaintext with the generated data to produce the cyphertext, and the
receiver XOR's the generated code of his generator with the received
Anyway, what I'm getting to here is that XOR (exclusive OR, the ^ operator in
C) will allow you to meet the above requirement:
D1(E2(E1(Card,eK1),eK2),dK1) = E2(Card,eK2) so as to be able to implement the
card playing protocol.
An analogy to this is a box that has two pad locks on it put in such a way so
that the owner of one lock can remove that lock without having the other owner
remove his first.
Basically the two players pass an encrypted deck to each other.  Off the top
of my head (please check this!) both players encrypt the deck of cards.  Alice and Bob are our players.  So Alice picks her hand, but since they are
still encrypted with Bob's key, she can't see what she's picked.  She passes
her picked hand to Bob.  He decrypts the hard with his key and returns it to
Alice.  Since this had was encrypted by Alice, Bob can't reveal it by decryption
Then Alice decrypts her hand and holds on to it.  She then passes the whole
deck (except for her hand) to Bob.  He picks his hand, sends it back to Alice,
she decrypts his hand and returns it to Bob.  He decrypts his hand and keeps
it, then passes the deck back to Alice.
When Alice needs to pick a card, she has to pass it to Bob to decrypt, etc.
And that in a nutshell is how the protocol works.  Since both sides see that
all the cards are there, they can verify that no one has cheated.  Since
neither side can see the other's cards, the game is safe.
I don't recall what you do with discarded cards... maybe mark them as such?
Also here's something else out to help you:
cardtype   cards[4*13+2]; // four suites of 13 cards + 2 jokers.
for (i=0; i<=4*13+2; i++) cards[i].cardnumber=i;
for (i=0; i<=10000; i++)
 {
  c1=rand() % (4*13+2);
  c2=rand() % (4*13+2);
  swapcards(&cards[c1],&cards[c2]);
 }
You still have to define what the cards structure is, but I suggest you put
in plenty of information in them such as a discarded flag, maybe a player's
ID in which hand this card lives (if you pass the whole deck instead of the
unused cards), flags to indicate which players encrypted this card, etc.
The two for loops above work to build a deck for you in the best possible way.
The 1st, initializes the deck in order..   The second shuffles the cards
by swapping two at a time.  These functions are far more efficient for
shuffling/building a deck of cards than by picking a random number for a card
ID and checking to see if we've already seen it.
Also, I would add functions in to automate the game, be it Poker, or 21, or
whatever....  Ie: allowing the players to decide what's wild, automatically
checking each player's hand and telling them their hand, allowing for a card
split in Blakc Jack, etc.
If you like I can see if I can find some sources to card games for you...

To quote you:
You mention Shamir, etc.  However I would point out that even if any of the
original RSA mathematicians found a better factoring algorithm, they'd be more
than likely to keep it under lock and key.  The obvious reason is that their
money supply depends on such an algorithm being suppressed.
Now, someone outside of their circle with a little less to worry about the
impact of such a factoring algirthm would be likely to publish it, but I doubt that PKP's founders would.

@_date: 1994-07-20 20:41:06
@_author: Arsen Ray Arachelian 
@_subject: Card Playing Protocol? 
Nope.  Alice's key is not Bob's key, so they can't cancel each other out.
ie:  Say Alice's key is 3 and Bob's key is 7 and the plaintext to encrypt
is 0.
Alice encrypts with her key, you get 3.
Bob encrypts with his key, you get 7.
Both encrypt and you get 4.
Bob decrypts the dualy encrypted message, and he gets 7 again.
Alice decrypts the dualy encrypted message and she gets 3.
But Bob doesn't know what the card is if its encrypted by Alice.
alice doesn't know what card it is if it's encrypted by Bob.
Only when the message is decrypted by one part can the other see it.  But
since you're sending the whole deck, there's no way one of the could cheat.
Now neither Bob nor Alice use XOR as a cypher.  They use a cypher such as
DES or IDEA in a rng mode whose output they XOR to the deck of cards to
encrypt or decrypt.
The reason I say this is that you're not really shuffling the cards very
well.  If a card is at the front of the deck, the odds are that it will
remain between the front of the deck and its relative position.  While
larger cards at the back of the deck are likely to swap themselves with
the ones in front just as likely as the ones in the back, this is a bit
one sided.  This is off the top of the my head and what's obvious in crypto
may not be actual, so Kent may want to test this out to see just how random
the shuffle is.
Yes, but the goal of shuffling is to randomize cards.  If you simulate it,
you're giving seasoned players a bigger advantage with the "odds" :-)  Then
again, the desireability of this is left to the implementor, so Kent you
decide which you want to do.
Seasoned players will prefer the second method, however, this may be less
random, and may infact weaken the security given by the protocol and
encrypting the deck because they may "guess" where the cards are likely to be.
Other issues: should the deck be reshuffled after each hand is played, or
should it continue to be used for the next few hands?  In "real" poker you
reshuffle occasionaly (anyone know the actual "rule" for this?)
Someone may build a good algorith to play poker.  You have no way of knowing
that you're playing against a machine or a human.  However, in the least you
can be sure that the machine can't cheat.  Though you could train it to be
very smart and keep track of every card that's been played and have it
calculate the odds for each next hand.  Casual players won't match this
"skill" but pros will.

@_author: Arsen Ray Arachelian 
@_subject: Card Playing Protocol? (fwd) 
The issue is this:  at the start a card has a 1/54 chance of being swapped
with >ANY< card.  The second card has a chance of 1/53 of being swapped
with >ANY< card, the third, a chance of 1/52... the 50th card has a chance
of 1/4, ... the 53rd card has a 1/2 chance of being swaped with the last
card or remains in its place (swapped with itself.)
So what I'm getting at is that the cards at one end of the deck have more
"mobility" than the cards in the other end of the deck.  The 1st cards
have a more spread out distribution so they have LESS of a chance of being
swapped out with the cards at the back of the deck.  The cards at the back
of the deck have a very tight space from which to be swapped. Therein lies
the problem of sorting.  As for SPEED, in the eight bit days, it would be
faster to do a MOD with a CONSTANT number than with a variable.  Why? Because the compiler can find ways of optimizing the MOD via right shifts
and substractions rather than using repeated substraction alone.
There was some challenge somewhere to come up with ways of dividing
numbers via shifting and substraction some time ago.  I'm sure the
division for 54 is faster than a general integer divide by substraction. It's hard to figure out how to divide by 54 via shifting, however, it
would do wonders for an eight bit machine. These days, some machines have
integer/floating division right in the CPU that's just as fast or almost
as fast.  With FPU's, even faster than shifting. :-)
Let's see... how do I break 54 down.... hmmm..  Okay, if we trash the
jokers it becomes easier:  52/4 == 52>>2.  This equals 13.  Now 13 being a
prime can't be divided...  I guess this is one way of looking at the card
value and stripping off the suite.  However, having divided by 4, you
saved yourself four times the work already.
So you take your picked card C and substract C>>2 from it.  If the result
is positive, you've got a remainder to a division by 4.  You then
substract 13 until you would get a negative value if you did one more
substraction.  The left over value is the mod 54 (I think.  Someone
correct me if I'm wrong.)
Anyhow, this is moot as you don't need to do this by hand anymore anyway.. :-)
Besides, if you want to cheat a bit, you can always take lrand() &0x0000003F
which would give you a range from 0 to 63, and if you should get a value
larger than 53, you substract 54 from it. :-)  Since all you want is a
random number from 0 to 53, it doesn't much matter.  I guarantee that this
is faster than division on most of the common machines anyway. :-)
Yes, but an AI could also be trained with these patterns.  A neural
network attached to a tracking engine that keeps track of his hand and
guesses at his opponents hand and the "odds" of what cards can come up
next against the odds of what he needs to win with isn't easy, but if done
right, it can prove a formidable opponent for the beginer poker player. :-)
It would be matched by seasoned players undoubtedly.  However, what I'm
getting to here is an automated digital cash paying/payed casio dealer. That is you could set up a telnet site where others can gamble against
your computer.  (I'll leave the legalities of this to others :-)  If this
machine is done the right way, even with mental poker and even if it can't
cheat you, it's still a very good card shark.  You could charge say, half
a ghostmark or whatever per 10 games just to play, plus a minimum bet of
one ghostmark per hand with doubling/raising/etc being allowed.
Hell, if you really want to get sick, you can have the AI keep databases
of the player's past patterns and how he ticks.  Unless players use random
anonymous packet bouncers, such AI's could be properly used to run a real
cypherspace  casino.  I'm sure if we look up some mobsters and give
them this idea they'd be happy to implement it once digital cash appears
in wide use.
Of course we're talking about ten years in the future, or never if digi
cash never makes it...
Don't however think that this can't be done.  There are chess games that
"think" ahead.  If programmed with the right set of fuzzy rules and given
extensive databases as to the opponents past moves/prefrences/bluffs/etc,
such an AI would be a great card shark.
Of course our player may decide to write a better auto-player and have it
play against another AI. :-)  But hey, if we're going to have smart
agents, their owners can be "backers" as there are for real gamblers out
there already. :-)
Yep.. the reason I asked was because in high school we played by almost no
rules. We'd have games where the "odd" numbered cards were wild, picture
cards wild, etc.... shit like that was common place...  I guess it's
bastardisation, but hey, it was fun and not for money.  And we didn't
reshuffle often.
BTW: Idea to prevent dealer cheating while shuffling the deck: Alice
Builds the deck from Ace of Spades to King o'Diamonds, encrypts it,
shuffles it herself, passes it to Bob, who shuffles it again, and encrypts
it, then passes it to Alice who picks her hand, etc.
If the cards are shuffled between every hands, this would prevent an AI
from keeping tack of the odds of unplayed cards.

8086's are very cheap these days.  They have enough computing power to run
something like IDEA, albeit very slowly.  I'd use a challenge/response method
with something like this, because you have to keep in mind that encrypted
signals can just as easily be captured.
You'd need a clock on the garage controller.  CMOS clock chips
anyone?  It doesn't have to be acurate to the second, but certainly to the
minute, and have date, month and year available to it.   The garage opener
would receive a signal from the remote, issue a challenge code based on a
hash of the time/date + some random numbers.  The remote would encrypt this
hash with the owner's IDEA key and send back the response.
Both units would need some sort of keypad to program the codes into them.  A
backup batery for both sides is also important along with a warning that
the main battery has failed.  You wouldn't want to lose access to your garage.
I suppose some backup entry system would also help... a two key system (using
physical keys with high security mushroom pin locks, etc.)  Remember that should
the remote opener fail, the driver would be damned pissed at crypto and we

@_subject: My anonymous remaile 
Again, the best way to build a secure remailer is to have one that sends a
fixed "remailer-packet" to other mailers for internal communication with other
remailers on the "network"
These packets should all be super-encrypted and of a fixed size.  This size
should be as small as possible.  Say around 200K or so.  Why?  Because this
serves to prevent email spamming by severly delaying a message.   Also if there
is some quota of say, no more than 100 messages a day from a user, it serves
to limit spamming quite a bit.
Basically all incoming mail is spooled on the remailer's hard drive in encrypted
form by the remailer.  When a new message is sent to the remailer, the remailer
will go through all the received messages and look for duplicate messages and
also count the number of messages sent by the user who just submitted another
At the end of the day, at a certain hour agreed upon by the remailer operators,
the remailer will split up its cached messages and split them among several
remailers with a RANDOM number of hops set in the message.  These packets will
then be randomly padded inbetween messages with null messages which would be
eaten by the receiving remailer.  The padding serves to limit traffic analysis
and the automatic hop number helps idiot users from being caught.
The packets will then be compressed and then would be encrypted with the respective public key of the target remailer and sent as a fixed sized block
again with rand padding at the end... perhaps via ftp or some other protocol,
but not necessarily via sendmail.  Having them as binary makes them easier to
handle than by sendmail...
When the packet is received by a remailer it would first decrypt it, then
decompress it, then remove null messages, then decrement the number of hops
and if it's zero, it would invoke sendmail to send them.
I strongly suggest that the remailer packet protocol be openly published so that
users can build their own packets to forward to remailers in encrypted form
rather than using sendmail.  I suppose that using sendmail to a remail should
still be allowed, but slowly phased out so as to force users to encrypt their
email.  Client software can be written for Windoze and Macs to use TCP/IP or
even Zmodem a packet into a remailer.
You may think that spamming can still occur by allowing users to send packets
themselves, however if the recepient remailer will limit the size of a packet
it will receive to a very small size (especially if it's coming from an unknown
site,) and refuse to receive more than one packet per day from that site, it
would prevent a lot of spamming and creeping detweilerism.
Perhaps remailers can work out a set of special private keys which they share
between them to speed up mail, or the size of the packet can be increased for
remailer-remailer transfers.
Anyhow, the system has to be balanced so that mail gets there in at most a
day or so, at best only a few hours depending on how often remailers talk to
each other.  If traffic at a remailer should suddenly increase, the remailer
should issue instructions to the other remailers that it'll send larger packets
or send more often.  But only after it receives permissions from the other
remailers should it send.
Perhaps if a remailer is too filled it should bounce a message to the sender
(if it knows his/her address...) or perhaps they can be polled to see if they're
busy, or better yet, the message can be forwarded to another remailer in the
old fashioned way (losing some security I guess)

This isn't the middle ages bub, nobody is going to flay you, nor will

you remember what happened to Rob Morris Jr?  He's the guy who unleashed
the internet worm.  Although his intentions weren't as evil as yours, he
did spend some jail time + lots of comunity time.
Sorry Bub, but yer too late.  One of the niceties of living in this
country is that you can be a demented Christian as easily as a demented
[fill in any religion] as well as a non-demented [fill in any religion.]
Christianity may be one of the most popular of religions in the world,
however it isn't the only one out there, and your demands that Pagan
BBS's be removed is unconstitutional.  Now that you've foolishly asked the
whole of Fidonet to break in and upload viruses to these systems, you've
opened yourself up for some serious jail time.   Now any hacker who is
busted can say "Oh, I was simply doing the work of God as inspired in me
by Steve Winter."
Now, lest we forget, viruses spread quite nicely.  Keep in mind that your BBS
may also be hit by the self same viruses you ask others to install.  Unlike you, viruses, human or electronic, do not discriminate by religion or
anything other than whether or not they can execute their malicious instructions
If you have proof that certain pagan organizations have sacrificed babies as
you claim, feel free to report them to the proper authorities.  If this is just
speculation on your part of "Oh, they ain't Krishtuns, so they must be
deveel wurshipurs" take a chill.  I have found that if anything Christians are
far  more dangerous folks than the "satanists" you suppose exists.
Keep in mind that Satanism is a Christian concept.  Very few religions have any
such concept as a "devil" or even of a malicious entity which could be called
a devil.  Also, I'd like to point out that several Christian holidays didn't
start out that day.  Christ wasn't born on December 25.  Dec 25 was chosen
because it coincided with the Roman Saturnalia festival, a festival for Saturn.
The reason they chose to pick Dec 25 is so they would not be persecuted by
the non-Christian Romans who were in power.  Later they used this date to help conver Romans over to Christianity.
Also, may I remind you Christ's message was not one of waging war against other
religions, it was to spread love and brotherhood.
There are and have been enough religious crusades that have ended up in
severe bloodshed.  Most of these in the past were done by Christians.  These
days you have religiously overzealous fanatic terrorists.  You might not have
realized it but >EVERY< religion claims to be the only "valid" one, and every
country which is zealously religeous believes that they are the "chosen ones"
Now, how do you suppose it is possible for ALL of them to be right when they
are all spewing the same old shit?  Now before you state Christianity IS the
only one, let me point again, they all share the same views.  So it's part of
the same pile.
Yes, this perhaps is a very similar speech the Turks heard when they decided to
decimate all Armenians in the early part of this century, ditto for the
Nazi's, the KKK, and undoubtedly the same kind of speech given to ALL soldiers
including those in the USA before they stormed in some enemy and exterminated
them.  Don't believe me?  I have a friend who was in Desert Storm.  His training
included daily doses of "Let's kill them desert niggers."
Such despicable nonsense cannot be tolerated.  Chill out or you may find yourself

That depends on whether or not you want to prevent spamming, and are willing
to waste bandwidth.  If you've got it, it's not a problem.  If you're running
your remailer on a system you don't own whose admins aren't going to be happy
about the extra traffic, you won't.

@_subject: XSPLIT now own ftp.wimsey.bc.ca 
I just uploaded a short program I wrote called XSPLIT to ftp.wimsey.bc.ca.
this is a simple crypto tool that splits a file into many files for secure
distribution.  A simple way of escrowing your data to the parties >YOU< only
trust and who don't know each other.
Whenever Gibson's idea of swiss like databanks will occur, you could encrypt
your file, split it with XSPLIT and upload it to several such databanks.
XSPLIT takes a file, generates n-1 random numbers, writes those random numbers
out to each of the n-1 files, and for the nth file it takes the XOR of all N
random numbers, and XORs it with the plaintext.  This way, you get to split
your file in such a way as to require all pieces of it in order to rebuild it.
This is certainly not earth shattering, and is similar to what clipper uses,
only its something you have available to you and something I wrote on a whim.
Enjoy.  (Source is included as usual and should be unix portable.)

@_subject: XSPLIT now own ftp.wimsey.bc.ca 
What do you mean?  The sources are included with XSPLIT.  The algorithm is
very very simple.
For all chars in input file:
I read a character from the infile called C.
I pick a number MOD the number of files.  I call this X
FOR FILES=0 TO N  IF FILES!=X
   Pick Random Number Q
   Write Randome Number Q to File    SUM=SUM XOR Q
NEXT FILES
 WRITE C XOR Q to File What exactly did you mean by n of m?  Since at each byte the numbers are picked randomly, the stream which holds the XOR'ed sum is random for each character.
So none of the parties holds any more information than any of the others and
it is all useless unless all of the files are joined together.

Very cool.  I wasn't aware that such a splitting program already existed,
although XSPLIT is different than shade in that you need all the parts to
put the file back together and if you miss a part, you don't have anything.
Also, XSPLIT will produce N files of the same size as the original file you
feed it.
What exactly is SHADE useful for?  Distributing a file where some of it can get
damaged?  Some software RAID implementation?  Can it be used for encryption?

Re: forcing text only...
Welp, you can simply modify the sources for it yourself to do this.
First, check to see if the character you've read is a control.  If it is
leave it alone and don't encrypt it.  Then if it's an alphanumeric character,
take the random number you've just read and do a binary AND operation on it
with a number less than 31.  Say 31 should suffice.
This should do the trick for what you want... But you should know that it will
kill the fuck out any security you might have ever had.
The best solution is to first ZIP up the file you want to XSPLIT, then use
XSPLIT on it, and feed the outputs of XSPLIT to something like UUENCODE...

Normally from lrand() or whatever.  This is of course weak, but there are
hooks for plugging in a hardware random number generator via a device
driver.  It can also take a file of random numbers and use that.
Eventually when I come across some BBS sources I may plug those into XSPLIT
and WNSTORM which uses the same random grabber functions.

Basically I cut this code out of WNSTORM where it works correctly.  Since I

argv[2][0] should be '-'
argv[2][1] should be 'R'
argv[2][2] should be 'F' argv[2][3] should be ':'
argv[2][4]... should be the random file.
Try it without the '-' infront of RF: and see if it makes a difference.

Speaking of DDJ's nice crypto articles for April 94, I just had
a truly weird thing arrive in the mail today.  It was a plastic
mailer bag from DDJ which contained Vol 1., Issue 1. of DDJ's

for such a mailing.  All the bag contains is the 8 page Dev.
Update issue and a card with my name and the return address for
the snail mail folks to be able to process the package.
There was NOT any April 94 issue of DDJ.  Have I been ripped,
or did DDJ goof, or was this mailing supposed to contain only
the 8 page thinggie???

"National Semiconductor has released the iPower encryption chip
which is designed for use in PCMCIA cards and provides a range of
security features.  The chip can encrypt via multiple encryption
algorithms (none listed) and will self destruct upon any

that when triggered will remove all trace of their existence

the kill code to one mailer which sends it on to the next

The resulting trail is a long, but quickly disappearing one.

That internet guy who handed out the flyer was in NYC. at the
last internet expo at Javitz.  I don't know how much setting
up a booth would cost, however, doing it that way is not
as effective as simply handing out disks to every Joe Yuppie
who goes out the door.
People will visit whatever booths they are interested in.
However someone handing out disks as to those who walk out
is far more likely to get the disks accepted as they are
freebies.  Especially if the target is ignorant to crypto
and Billary. :-)
At some point he may try the hypertext thinggie, if it
sparks some interest he may look and use the software. If
he doesn't recycle the disks, he may pass them on to
others...  At some point some big cheeze will get his
hands on it, and start worrying about how the WireTap
act, Clipper and other issues may affect his company.

Disks, in bulk are cheap and we can get them preformatted.
I have (a long time ago) written a disk image duplicator
program called DIM (BTW: I lost the sources to the most
recent version, so I don't plan to update it anymore) but
we can use it to mass duplicate disks.
If we could get just four-five folks in every expo to
chip in $20 do the duplication and distribution, we
can have an effective awareness raising campaign..
MEI Microcenter sells preformatted (DOS) disks in bulk
for $0.39 cents!  Two $20 contributions can buy about
100 disks!  That's quite a lot of people to wake up.
The biggest problem is designing the software to be
in the form of animation so it'll be watched.  Plain
text is nice too, but not everyone has the time to
read.  Most folks like TV and like to vegetate
infornt of the TV.  If we can have a self running
animated demo of sorts (without having to install
to the guys hard drive!) and still have enough room
for neat stuff like PGP and SecureDrive and such, we
have got it made.
Another issue is printing flyers to go with the disks
so we can get them interested in viewing/copying the
disks.  (Perhas include a program to duplicate the
disks on the demo disk so that the DOS virgins can
spread the disk...)
Also, we need to have professional looking labels on
the disks.  I'd be weary of accepting a disk that
has a cheap looking label.  My 1st reaction would be
"Is this a trojan???"  Quality control and virus
checking MUST be included in the package.  Perhaps
when the program 1st runs it can do a CRC of all
the files on the disk to make sure that they have
not been altered and tell the viewer of this...
Once we have the collection of programs ready, I can
ftp a disk image over to a few FTP sites so that other
cypherpunks can join in on the fun.  (Also a postscript
file for the flyers and such...)
1st things 1st, I reccomend that Secure Drive 1.3x
and PGP 2.3x and PGPShell are on the disk.  Are there any other crypto packages that your average y
yuppie, (possibly ODS virgin) would find useful?
Remember that we need enough space on the disk to
include clipper articles.  We probably can't distribute
the New York Times articles, so we'll have to write
our own (and insert the FUD factor!!!)  We need
to write/use a freeware hypertext/hypermedia
program to list, print, and extract those files.
A small disk copy program can be included which would
simply read in the whole disk, ask the viewer for a
blank, formatted disk and write to it.  We can use
the user's hard drive for temp space (check the
DOS TEMP variable 1st!) possibly XMS and EMS so
that the user doesn't have to swap disks.  Batch
files are neat but may not always work right on
every machine.  Keep in mind that with the DOS
wars we can't use any special features found in
any DOS above 3.30 (DR DOS, IBM DOS, MS-DOS, etc.)
We should use EGA/CGA for the demo, (check for EGA
and use it!) and use highly compressed, or better
yet vector images for the animation so that we
don't fill up the disk quickly.
We could use text mode graphics and ANSI like
pictures, but we'd need our own display program
as not all machines have ANSI installed, and
we can't ask a DOS virgin to do that.  We also
don't want to modify the user's hard drive if
we can help it as that would keep their fears down.

(Incase you aren't familiar with SecureDrive, it's a device
driver that automatically encrypts a whole partition.)  The
driver I'm working on will use a file to store the encrypted
volume on.  Once the drive is mounted anything stored on it
is secured.  I'm going to leave the crypto code open.  I'll
probably provide a module for DES and IDEA, and leave some
open specs so others can write their own modules and stuff.
I'd encourage others to use these modules in other software
that they'll write...  They're basically stand alone code.
I haven't decided if the crypt modules will be just code
resources or INITs with Gestalt selectors installed. Depends
on how feasable the stuff is with drivers...

I'm curious about how one would go about spy-proofing one's house..
I suppose the 1st few steps would be to make each room a Faraday
cage...  What kind of sheet metal would be good to use for this?
Would somet thin metal suffice?
In terms of isolating the windows from ir-laser pickups, I thought
I could attach speakers to every window and tune them to some
radio station that doesn't exist, or better yet a RNG so that
audio-substraction wouldn't work.  (One of the ways of spying is
to bounce a laser off a window.  The vibrations from the window
would cause vibrations in the reflection of the laser beam, so
the spy can listen in on your conversation.  However if there's
a lot of noise outside your house, they would simply hang a mike
aimed at the source of the noise and substract the two signals to
filter out everything but what they're trying to spy on...)
Another thing I've heard is some stuff about the US Embasy refusing
to move into a building that was full of bugs in the now defunct USSR,
and one of the reasons is that they were detecting lots of
micro-wave-emmisions.  The article stated that this was a health
risk, but someone on here(???) stated that microwaves can be used
in place of bouncing an ir-laser beam off a window because any
metal objects in the target room would also vibrate with sounds...
So as a summary, I would make the room a faraday cage with speakers
on it every few feet fed into individual RNG's, then use some of
that sound isolation foam all around the metal slabs, then set
up the dry wall/floor/ceilings on top of all that...

TIME Online Odeon, March 10, 1994
Tonight's TIME Online Odeon is a debate about the controversial "Clipper
Chip" policy of the U.S. government.  Our guests are John Barlow (Barlow1)
and Dorothy Denning (DDenning), who were both interviewed for TIME's
Clipper story in the March 14, 1994, issue of the magazine.  Philip
Elmer-DeWitt (PhilipED), TIME senior writer and author of the story,
moderates the debate, and Robert Pondiscio (RPTime) of TIME is the host.

OnlineHost : Good evening and welcome to the Time Online Odeon!                     Tonight we look from both sides at the Clipper Chip, a
                   semiconductor device that the National Security Agency                    developed and wants installed in every telephone,                    computer modem and fax machine.                    In his article in the current issue of TIME, Philip
  "The chip combines a powerful                     encryption algorithm with a ''back door'' -- the                    cryptographic equivalent of the master key that opens                    schoolchildren's padlocks when they forget their                    combinations. A ''secure'' phone equipped with the chip                    could, with proper authorization, be cracked by the                    government.
                   "Law-enforcement agencies say they need this capability to
                   keep tabs on drug runners, terrorists and spies. Critics                    denounce the Clipper -- and a bill before Congress that
                   would require phone companies to make it easy to tap                    the new digital phones -- as Big Brotherly tools that will
                   strip citizens of whatever privacy they still have in the                    computer age.                    "Lined up on one side are the three-letter cloak-and-
                   dagger agencies -- the NSA, the CIA and the FBI -- and key
                   policymakers in the Clinton Administration (who are                    taking a surprisingly hard line on the encryption issue).                    Opposing them is an equally unlikely coalition of computer
                   firms, civil libertarians, conservative columnists and a                    strange breed of cryptoanarchists who call themselves                    the cypherpunks." RPTime:   Lined up on our stage tonight are John Perry Barlow, Dr.                 Dorothy Denning and Philip Elmer-DeWitt.  Barlow is                 co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which                 promotes freedom in digital media.  A recognized                 commentator on computer security, he is arguing against                 the Clipper Chip.
                Dr. Denning is the chairperson of the Computer Science                 Department at Georgetown University. A leading expert                 on cryptography and data security, she favors the                 adoption of the  Clipper Chip.
                Philip Elmer-DeWitt, TIME's technology editor will lead                 the questioning of our guests.
                Audience questions may be sent up using the Interact
                with Host function....Phil?
PhilipED:   Dr. Denning, could you *briefly* make the case for why                 we need the key escrow encryption system?
DDenning: The government needs a new encryption standard to                 replace DES.  They came up with a very strong                 algorithm called SKIPJACK.  In making that available,                 they didn't want to do it in a way that could ultimately                 prove harmful to society.  So they came up with the                 idea of key escrow so that if SKIPJACK were used                 to conceal criminal activity, they would be able to get                 access to the communications.
PhilipED:  Thanks. Mr. Barlow, could you briefly make the case
                *against* Clipper?
Barlow1:   We'll see if I can be brief...We oppose Clipper in                 large part because of the traffic analysis which it                 makes possible.  We believe that it is in the                 functional nature of the chip as designed to greatly                 enhance the ability of government to observe who                 we are calling, when, and from where, all fairly                 automatically and centrally.  We also oppose Clipper                 because of the many way in which we believe the                 escrow system could be compromised, by people                 and institutions both inside and outside of government.
PhilipED:   Dr. Denning, what about John's contention that                 Clipper makes it easier to detect calling patterns?
DDenning: I don't buy this.  First off, for law enforcement to
                access any communications, they need a court                 order.  Even if the communications are encrypted.                  Second, with a court order, they can get access                 to call setup information and find out what other                 lines the subject of the investigation is talking to.
                This is of much more use than anything in the                 encrypted stream. PhilipED:  John, is Dorothy right that you need a court order
                for call set up info?
Barlow1:   Dorothy, the government asked for and received over
               100,000 calling records last year without a court
               order.  I see nothing in the Clipper documents which
               indicates that they would require a court order to get                this kind of information, which each chip would make                readily available to the entire network. Furthermore,                my faith in court orders has been eroded by 30 years
               of government wiretap abuse.
DDenning: You need a court order to do implement pen registers
                and dialed number recorders in order to find out who
                is talking to whom.
Barlow1:   But that's only with the present system where putting
               a pen register on a line requires physical entrance to a                company site.
PhilipED:  Aren't we talking about three different hurdles here, one                for a wiretap, one for a pen register (to track calling                patterns in real time) and one for phone records?
Barlow1:   There are three different sources of information, as
                you say. But there are not three "hurdles."
RPTime:   Let's take a question from the audience...
Question:  How would you guarantee that this facility will never be                 misused?  If you can't make that guarantee, why                 should a democratic society, with a prohibition                 against prior restraint, consent to this?
RPTime:   John Barlow?
Barlow1:   That sounds like a question for Dorothy. I don't think                 we should, obviously.
RPTime:   Dr. Denning?
DDenning: First of all, there has been no evidence of widespread                 abuse of wiretaps since passage of the 1968 and 1978                 wiretap statutes.  Second, there are a lot of security                 mechanisms going into it to protect against abuse.
                Third, it will provide much greater protection against                 illegal wiretaps than we have now, since almost all                 phone conversations are in the clear.  It will make                 virtually all illegal wiretaps impossible.  Fourth,
                if for some reason it doesn't provide adequate                 protection, we can destroy the key databases and                 everyone will have absolute privacy against government
                wiretaps.  I don't think our society will tolerate that                 kind of abuse.  PhilipED:  John, isn't Dorothy right that you're better off with                 compromised encryption than none?
Barlow1:   Gee, where to begin...First of all, there was plenty                 of abuse after 1968.  Remember Watergate, Dorothy?
                Second, I believe that Clipper in the Net will                 dramatically *enhance* certain powers of surveillance                 over current technical abilities. One of the reasons that
                wiretap hasn't been more abused is the bureaucratic                 overhead of current practices. Make it so that it                 doesn't require 50 agents to conduct a wire tap and                 you'll see a lot more of it.  And Watergate included                 quite a number of wiretap violations. Indeed,  the                 burglers were caught trying to install one.
DDenning: I was talking specifically about wiretap abuses.  And
                there hasn't been any evidence since the 1978 law.
Barlow1: As to the assertion that we can always back up and                destroy the databases if we don't like it, I can't imagine                that someone as bright as yourself would believe that                this is possible. Technology and power ratchet into                positions which almost never retract without a complete                change in the system of authority RPTime:   Care to respond Dr. Denning?
DDenning: Clipper would prevent the Watergate burglars from getting                 anywhere since they wouldn't have a court order.                  Clipper will not make wiretaps cheaper or easier.  Wiretaps
                are becoming more difficult.  And there will always be                 more agents involved because they have to follow                 exacting procedures, including minimization (throw out
                all conversations that are not specific to the crime at
                hand).
Barlow1:   Dorothy, they were from the *Government* remember? I can't                 imagine that Nixon wouldn't have been able to find a                 sympathetic ear from somebody at NIST and somebody else                 at Treasury.  Further, you're not talking about the truly                 insidious element of this, which is dramatically improved                 traffic analysis. Content is less important than context,                 and most agents will support this.
RPTime:   Another question from the audience.  JCMaille asks...
Question:  Does the government have a constitutional right of access                 to my personal communications?
RPTime:    Dr. Denning, why don't you go first?
DDenning: The Supreme Court ruled that wiretaps with a court                 order are constitutional.  At one time, communications                 were not even protected under the 4th Amendment.                  The government could wiretap without a court order!                  Now a court order is required.
PhilipED:  To put the question another way, do citizens have a right                 to use powerful encryption?
DDenning: Right now there are no laws preventing the use of any
                encryption.  Clipper is voluntary.  You can still use
                something else.
<< Notice that she said "Right now" as if she is aware of a possible
   bit of legislation that would make all other encryption methods
   illegal!!!>>
RPTime:   We have to apologize.  John Barlow has temporarily lost                 his connection...
PhilipED:  Dr. Denning, in your opinion would a law outlawing                 powerful encryption be unconstitutional?
DDenning: I don't think so.  But that doesn't mean it will happen.
<< NOTE: ^^^^^^ ******* ^^^^^>>
RPTime:   John Barlow is back with us.  Sorry for the interruption! PhilipED:  Barlow, Denning just said she didn't think a law banning                 powerful encryption would be unconstitutional.  What                 do you say?
Barlow1:   Actually, I believe that our current export embargoes are                a violation of the 1st Amendment which specify speech                without regard to the manner of speech. If we could                restrict manner of speech, it would be constitutional                to require that everyone speak English. Which of                course it isn't.
PhilipED : John, can you make the case why ordinary law-abiding                 citizens need powerful encryption?
Barlow1:   Because it is in the nature of digitally networked                 communications to be quite visible. Everytime
                we make any sort of transaction in a digital
                environment, we smear our fingerprints all over
                Cyberspace.  If we are to have any privacy in the                 future, we will need virtual "walls" made of cryptography.
RPTime:   Another audience question...
Question:  Isn't this like the gun argument? If guns are outlawed                 only criminals will have guns?  Well, if Clipper is                 standardized, won't criminals be the ones NOT                 using it?
RPTime:   Dr. Denning?
DDenning: If Clipper becomes the de facto standard, then it will                 be the chief method of encryption.  That would be
                what you'd get at Radio Shack.  What criminals
                use will depend on what is readily available and what
                their cohorts are using.  Both parties of a                 conversation have to use the same thing.  Criminals                 also talk to a lot of people outside their immediate                 circle - e.g., to buy goods and services.  Also,                 they can be quite stupid at times.  But the main                 thing is that criminals will not be able to take                 advantage of the SKIPJACK algorithm as a way                 of concealing their  conversations.  This is the                 whole point.  It is not to catch criminals.  It is
                to allow people access to a really high quality
                algorithm in a way that someone cannot use                 it to conceal criminal activity.
<< More like it's to have people think they have a really high quality
encryption device while they are spied upon by Uncle Sam's boys.>>
Barlow1:   The gun analogy is excellent up to a point. I can't
                for the life of me imagine why we would think that
                even a stupid criminal would use Clipper if                 something else were available. And when I talk
                to people in the administration their big hobgoblin
                is the "nuclear-armed" terrorist. Any fanatic                 smart enough to assemble and detonate a nuclear
                device is going to be smart enough to download
                PGP from a bulletin board somewhere.
                Also, I'd like to point out that the gun analogy
                doesn't go the whole distance. Crypto is by its
                nature a purely *defensive* technology. You can't
                shoot people with it.
PhilipED:  Speaking of PGP, Dr. Denning, is that encryption
                system secure, in your opinion?
DDenning: I don't know of anyone who's been able to break the
                IDEA algorithm that it uses.
<< Notice that she sidesteps Barlow's point about gun control and
only answers about IDEA. >>
RPTime:   Back to the audience for a question from Steve HW..
Question:  This is for Dr. Denning.  What is the evidence of                 harm if the Clipper proposal is not adopted?
DDenning: The harm would be to the government.  They would
                not be able to use it and would have to resort                 to something less secure.  Also, Clipper is part                 of a larger project to make hardware available                 for encryption and digital signatures.  This
                will be used, for example, in the Defense Message
                System.  The goverment needs a new standard.
                I personally believe that making really powerful
                encryption like SKIPJACK available without                 key escrow could be harmful to society.  Wiretaps                 have been essential for preventing and solving                 many serious crimes and terrorist activities.
<< If Clipper is to be used for digital signatures, what's to stop
a cop who did a wire tap from pretending to be the parties he just
spied on?  There would be no harm to government as there are other
encryption methods out there just as strong as skipjack if not
more so.   The new standard could simply be RSA, IDEA, etc...>>
Barlow1:   Why on earth would the government have to use                  something else if they failed to get the rest of
                 rest of us to buy into this folly?  Hey, they are                  already using SKIPJACK. It's a government                  algorithm and has been in use for a: long time.
                 There are plenty other algorithms which we
                 can use which  are truly protected... unless of                  course, this is only the first step in a process
                 which will outlaw other forms of crypto. And I
                 believe that it must be. Makes absolutely no sense
                 otherwise. << Bingo! >>
DDenning : CPSR and others are asking the government to drop
                  Clipper.
Barlow1:    EFF is not asking the Government to drop Clipper,
                   though we would vastly prefer they did. We're
                   merely asking that no steps be taken to require it
                   either by law or practice...as, for example, would
                   be the case if you had to use a Clipper chip to file
                   your tax return.
PhilipED :     Dr. Denning, do you think this is the "first step in
                   a process to outlaw crypto"?
DDenning:   No I do not.  The government has not been using
                   SKIPJACK to my knowledge.  The Clipper initiative                    represents the first time that the government has
                   put one of their really good algorithms out there in                    the unclassified arena.  They are trying to do this
                   in a way that won't backfire against the public.
                   Other NSA developed algorithms are not available                    for purchase by the public.
<< Yeah, right sure they won't try to outlaw other encryption methods.  If the NSA has other algorithms which are not for public use, let the
Government use some of those instead!>>
Barlow1:     I appreciate their willingness to make some of that
                   crypto research available to a public which has paid
                   so much for it, but I'm afraid that I would never                    trust an algorithm which was given to me by any
                   government.  And I certainly don't trust a classified                    algorithm like Skipjack, even without a back door                    which everyone can see. I think I'll stick to systems
                   which have been properly vetted to be clear of                    such compromises, like RSA. I hope others will do                    likewise and that RSA will become the standard                    which Clipper shouldn't be.
RPTime:      Time for one more question from our audience...
Question:   To John Barlow:  Isn't society becoming increasingly
                   vulnerable to concerted criminal/terrorist disruption,                    requiring *stronger* law enforcement tools?
Barlow1:    Gee. I don't know. It's a scary world. However, I'm
                   willing to take my chances with the few terrorists
                   and drug lords there are out there rather than
                   trusting government with the kind of almost unlimited
                   surveillance power which Clipper and Digital                    Telephony would give them. It's a touch choice. But
                   when you look at the evil perpetrated by government
                   over this century in the name of stopping crime,
                   it far exceeds that done by other organized criminals.
<< Here, here!>>
PhilipED:     Dr. Denning, hasn't remote listening technology                   enhanced police abilities to eavesdrop to the point...
                  where the loss of a few wire taps won't mean much?
DDenning: No.  They need to get the cooperation of the service
                  providers to implement a wiretap.  The loss of some                  wiretaps could be costly indeed.  As an example,
                 wiretaps were used to help solve a case that involved
                 plans by a Chicago gang from shooting down a                  commercial airliner.  There have been 2 cases where
                 they helped save the lives of kids who were going to
                 be kidnaped for the making of a snuff murder film.
                 They helped solve a case where a man's house was                  going to be bombed.  I could go on.  If we take John's
                 arguments about law enforcement to their logical                  conclusion, we'd just get rid of law enforcement.  I                  think it's better to have it.  The people in law                  enforcement hate it as much as the rest of us when
                 some member of the community does something wrong.
                 And they correct it, design new procedures and laws
                 where necessary, and go on.

DDenning: Clipper is not going to change the balance of power.
                  It does not give law enforcement any additional
                  authority to do wiretaps.  << Yeah, right....  Two DAT tapes could contain the whole of the
key-escrow databases.. what price would some desperate criminal
organization, government, or government agency pay to obtain them?>>
Barlow1:   Well, this is where we basically disagree, Dorothy.
                  If we could continue the same level of law
                  enforcement capacity we presently have, I'd have                   no objection. But I believe, for reasons I'm not sure                   we have the bandwidth to discuss here, that we                   are talking about dramatically enhancing their abilities.                   For one thing, we would greatly reduce the                   bureaucratic overhead involved in wiretap, which is                   what keeps it under 900 cases nationwide at the                   present.
RPTime:     And that will have to be the last word on the matter
                 for tonight...
DDenning: The overhead of a wiretap is more likely to increase,
                 not decrease.

RPTime:   THAT will be the final word!

Vice President Says Clipper Chip Controls Inadequate

Absolutely.  What most folk don't realize is that >ALL< money is inherently
useless until all the folks involved in its trade deem it of value and of
use.  Money sitting in one's pocket is also useless.  Sure we put the little
suckers in savings and make interest off'em, but only because the bank
moves them around for us, lending to those who don't really need it. :-)
Money is analogous to electrons.  Moving it around, it does a lot of work
for us.  Keeping it as static electricity is totally useless.  Putting it
in a capacitor, has some use.  Sometimes you need a cartain ammount of
electrons to be able to do a certain ammount of work, however if you leave it
there forever, the charge will eventually leak out (like inflation...)
Depressions and such are the result of money not moving anywhere... there's
a really cool story somewhere by Aliester Crowley on the adventures of a
particular bit of paper money exchanging hands, getting everyone involved
in its adventures to either do work or services, and to provide work and
services in return...
(That's why I believe those who wish to do away with money are idiots.
Without it, there's no common denominator on what a service, object or
whatever is worth.  No real way to establish the worth of something. Sure
there's barter, but its far too limited as a means of circulating services
and goods...  Money, paper, gold, or digital is only worth what we tell it
to be worth...  hell, if it were legal (and safe) we'd be using plutonium
coins instead of money... :-)

BTW: What's the FBI, Cops, etc. supposed to do when their "suspect" is

Can you use PGP after you buy ViaCrypt?  After all, you paid for
ViaCrypt, and since it's supposedly the same as PGP, can you simply
use PGP and mention that you have purchased ViaCrypt?
The other thing you could do is get a PC hooked up via appletalk to
your Mac network (or via ethernet, etc.)  You could send batch files
for it to execute somehow, and it should run in full speed.
Something like all the Macs on the network have a shared directory
with the PC which runs PGP...  On the PC end, there's a program that
looks in this directory, reads a batch file, executes it, deletes the
batch file.  You'll also need some sort of file locking method.
The simplest of these is to just rename the file... say, write a
file called LOCKED XXXX940318132811 which the PC should ignore because
it won't look like the file it wants... then when the file is closed,
it can be renamed XXXYYYY.PGP which the server on the PC end will
simply shell out to and then delete...
the XXX in the file name could be the Mac station ID...  The output
of these batch files could go to a file called XXXYYY.RES for result.
The batch file can include the message to sign, look at, etc... How?
You can use the echo command to redirect to a file, or you can put
input/output files in other directories...

Might not work as the incandescent light source still won't stop the
window from vibrating.  They can still reflect a laser off it regardless
of the output of another source.  They may have tweak their amps... but
it won't help against it.
Won't work.  You need a random, independant source of noise.  Each
window pane should have its own noise source attached to a speaker.
If the speaker is tuned into a radio station, they too can tune into
the same station, then substract the two signals giving them a fairly
clear ear to listen in from.  A random noise source that is independant
will do well because they can't substract it out.  If two windows in
two different rooms also use the same random noise, they can differentiate
between the two rooms and get the sound.
I suppose they could bounce four or five lasers on the same window in
hopes of being able to use two beams for the substraction, but if the
speaker is placed in a good location, or several of them are placed
on the same window, they'll have a bitch of a time getting anything.
In that case they'll probably resort to using microwaves to bounce off
a metal item in the room which would also vibrate with any sounds in the
room.  The only real defense against that would be strong shielding
and a microwave detector to see if the shielding failed... the shielding
has to be sound isolated or else the walls of the shielding could be
used to get sound.. :-(  Pretty nasty shit, eh?
Nope, it's da truth. :-)  I'm not doing this out of paranoia.  I'm

Congrats, you've tripped on an idea of mine, which I've already implemented.
:-)  Actually, I've done a lot more than just encrypt the data with noise
and mixed the two, as that would be insecure once you know the algorithm...
If you guys are interested, I'll post up a "alpha-development" version of the
paper I wrote describing this thing.  This btw is my project for the crypt-
analysis class I'm taking...  On the surface it seems pretty secure... There
was a hole I plugged up, but that's another issue...
I did have a working version of the software, however a rather uncool program
decided to eat my hard drive for breakfast, and unfortunatly I lost it.  THe
last two backups are of a previous (unplugged) version and of a half-way
inbetween non-working version...  Now I've been busy working on a SecureDrive
type program for the Mac so I haven't payed much attention to this, however
it has some very interesting possibilities including the ability to be used
in stego in a verry cool way...
Ditto, only I used several channels, not just two...
That's how mine works... it works by taking in the noise and a passkey. The
passkey determines which bits are noise and which are data, and more importantly
how to decrypt the data...
If you take the random noise data you feed in, and replace it with the low bits
of a picture, you've got a pretty good stego program...

it can be zapped by a frustrated would-be-codeanalyst...  Of course now
that we can back it up to tape, it's not that big an issue. :-)
Also, the old SecureDrive program had a protection feature in the TSR, but
in any case, it wouldn't help if the TSR was killed off, or if our bad-guy
booted from a floppy.  He could still kill the drive...

This is my reply to Perry about the PCExpo Cypherpunks attack.  I'd originalkly
meant this as a private message, but there's enough good info/requests that
I'd like >ALL< of us to read it.  I hope you won't mind Perry.
For those of you just tuning in, this is an idea I've had: I want some cypher
punks to join in together and simply hand out disks and flyers at PC Expo
which contain crypto files and articles.  This will be in NYC June 28-30.
My gut reaction is to try and make it for the 1st day since that's when it's
busiest, and perhaps we can catch some press-attention if possible.  However,
this will depend on who is free and when.  We don't have to register for PCExpo
nor go in. In fact, it would be a bad idea to hand out these disks on Javitz's property
because we haven't rented a booth there (I'd rather we spend the money on
duplicating disks.)  If all of us chip in $20 worth of disks, it will make a
very big difference.  You can get disks very cheap from MEI microcenter at
800-634-3478 or whereever.  Just make sure you get 3.5" 1.44M disks...
If you can't attend because you're not in NYC or not available and are a good
writer, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE write some anti-clipper anti-digital telephony
articles.  We need this because I don't want a copyright infringement on
our hands (ie: information liberation front and newspaper articles.)  As usual
we can take quotes out of articles say "New York Times said Clipper is a brain
dead idea" and such, but we need stuff that we can't be thrown in jail or
sued for.  We also need folks to contribute ideas/software to add to the disks
and more importantly to  review the disks...
Re: Disks & $$$
Not really.  Disks are pretty damn cheap these days.  If you buy'em from
MEI MicroCenter you can get 3.5"HD's for $0.41 cents a piece, or cheaper if you
get'em in over 300.  10 disks=$4.  IF every PC-Expo-punk chips in 20 disks,
we should have plenty to make a neat dent in the Clipper-ignorant-crowd.
The software: PGP, SecureDevice/Drive, a file viewer (sor of like list) which
I've written that does some minimal mouse support, a menu system I guess, and
lots of articles.
I'd need someone to look at articles and kill off the ones that may cause
copyright problems for this disk.  I'm not putting my name on the disks, but
if someone were to sniff hard, they'd catch my smell, so that's one thing I
want to avoid.  Basically, if you have any articles, or better yet if you'd
be able to write some or get other c'punks to write some which we can
distribute, it would be very cool.
If you can attend PC Expo, please send email to rarachel at photon.poly.edu for
faster processing.
Oh, one more thing: I'll be making the disk duplications myself.  This is so
that our "spook" friends don't install viruses in our software.  There is
of course the question of trusting me, but I know I trust myself. :-)  Perhaps
the simplest thing is to include a virus scanner on the disk.  Whatever...
We also need someone to mass produce labels for the diskettes with a logo.
NO CYPHERPUNK CRIMINAL LOGO!  It's a cool logo, I have the T-shirt, but
PCExpo attending yuppies will fear us more than the spooks if they see
"Criminal" on the disk.   I suggest "Free Security Articles And Software Demo"
as the title of the disk.  MAke it look like some corporation is giving out
freebies.  Oh,I really hate this one, but we should all be dressed professionally
(ie: suits, ties, yuck!)  This would hurt our credibility if we didn't....
Anyhow, nothing is organized yet, except that a few volunteers have signed
up.  So please, if you can contribute anything join in.
After this is over, we'll have a cypherpunk diskette whch other cpunks in
other citities can use to mail to the media, give out to other expos, etc.

there's no need to fear the spooks.  I'd bet some of them are even sympathetic

infact also be productive through anon remailers.  It's time to make some

The idea is that Joe Sixpack will probably not give a shit for a long time,
that PC Expo attendees don't all have access to BBS's or the internet because
a lot of them aren't PC literate but are trying to be.  Most are just suits
who need to know about PC's.
Putting PGP on BBS's has already been done.  Handing out flyers won't help.
It'll cost far too much to give out free flyers in terms of number of pages
and information.  At best only a bit of teasing info can fit.
We won't be inside Javitz so they can't kick us out.  We'll be right outside
on the street.  We'll make it look like a some company is hading out freebies.
Lots of PC Expo attendies are there for the freebies and the info they can
show their bosses.  As Jack Nicholson said in Batman "Wait till they get
a load of me!" :-)
Some will just format the disks, granted.  Most will look first.  Especially
if it looks like a pro job.  Once they have a look, they'll probably want
to look deeper.  That's where the fud factor comes in.  If we can get the

The following describes the a crypto program I've written.  This is an update
to WNSTORM which is on csua.berkeley.edu (?) was soda...  Mucho improvements
have been made.  Unfortunately, it will probably be a while before this winds
up in a readable directory... so until then you can request it from me,
and as long as you're in the USA I'll send you a copy...
Here's the blurb...
(send requests to rarachel at photon.poly.edy rather than replying to this
message if you want me to get to them quicker...)
WNSTORM(tm) 2.10  Copyright (C) 1994 by Ray (Arsen) Arachelian

WNSTORM (White Nouse Storm) is a new cryptography and steganography software
package which I'm developing.  You can use WNSTORM to encrypt your files to
keep prying eyes from invading your privacy.  You can use WNSTORM to hide
files, be they text, or otherwise within PCX images (other image formats will
be supported in the future.)
WNSTORM's method of hiding files in PCX images is very secure.  With the right
kind of image, you won't even see any changes made to the picture unless you
look very very closely, and even then you are unlikely to recognize that there
is hidden data in the image.  (Some images don't work well, others work very
You can then take the PCX image containing the hidden data and send it to your
friend, or post it up publicly on the alt.binary.pictures.* or whatever.  Only
you and anyone you share the password with can get at the hidden data file!
More importantly, the intended recipient of the picture does not have to have a
previous copy of the image to get at the hidden data.
WNSTORM is also an encryption system.  Unlike conventional systems, WNSTORM
uses random numbers to hide and encrypt your file.  (see documentation for
technical details.)  WNSTORM's encryption uses elements of frequency hopping
(also known as spread spectrum transmissions) but instead of using it over
radio waves, it uses it on your files.  It does this by breaking up your
file into eight separate channels and mixing in anywhere between 16 to 240
other bogus random noise channels with your eight data channels.  The
number of bogus channels varies with each byte taken from your file.  The
position (similar to a frequency of a channel used by spread spectrum
communications) depends on the values in the bogus channels as well as your
password.   The password can be upto 150 characters (that's 1200 bits) however
this can easily be changed to longer passwords.
All the source code for WNSTORM and its supporting programs is also included.
It's there for you to examine and see that there are no back doors, and to
modify so as to improve it.
WNSTORM is >FREE<, but not public domain.  You may freely use it and give
copies away to anyone you like.  (see documentation for license information.)

If any of you managed to get it off wuarchive, great.. if not, sorry... I've
just looked and some sysadmin removed it... I haven't seen it in the msdos
directories either so that's a big problem...
I do however have the permission of someone to use theri ftp site, however, I
cannot publically post the site name at his request.  If you want it, email
me and I'll tell you the site name, but please don't post it to the list.

Perhaps we should  just call the FBI and tell them that we have information
that he has child porno on his computer (anonymously of course), and call
the Customs office and say he has exported crypto, and call the CIA and tell them he's working for the soviets?  :-)

@_subject: "lifeguard(?)": bullet tracking system??? 
Hey guys, I heard a blurb on the radio a few days abo about something called
"lifeguard" which can track the source of gunfire.  My guess is that they
use acoustics for this.  I don't know how they can claim that it wouldn't be
confused by non-gun noises, nor what silencers would do to this thing.
They also mentioned that some models can be fitted with guns so as to auto
matically return fire...
Is this bullshit?  Anyone else hear about this?  I wish they'd given out
more info on this thing... I heard this on WCBS (AM) in NYC...
This can have some serious big brother is watching effects in bad neighborhoods.
Such a beast could be fitted with a machine gun to simply fire wherever it
hears a bullet come from, potentially killing anyone else who happens to be
near the source of the fired gun, more likely a hostage with a gun to his head
than the holder of the gun... :-(
Ugh, if this is what the crime bill means, I'm all for legalizing drugs just
to get the cops and criminals out of business...  Shit if every pharamacy
sold cheap drugs, or every liqour store, there'd be a gigantic drop ib
drug related murders.  Sure, the ammounts of stick ups and burglaries that
liquor stores would suffer would rise, but, if the FBI, CIA, ??? are already
involved in drug runnimg, they may as well make it legal and stop hiding their
activities.  (Of course if they did their economic strangleholds would drop)

The only place you're likely to find only info on crypto is [drum roll please]
sci.crypt on usenet news. :-)  While crypto is the main focus of cypherpunks,
occasionally other  issues do come up.
Privacy, the evils of the state, microphones in Dunkin Donuts, etc. are
certainly of interest to the denizens of cypherpunks, and so quite on topic.

What's the relevance of microphones in Dunkin Donuts?  What's the relevance of
Digital Telephony II?  What's the relevance of 1984?  What's the relevance
of yet another use of technology by Uncle Sam to strenghen law enforcement
and the millitary?

I agree with Tim on this.  There's no way I'm going to leave PGP on
poly's machines with the key right there for anyone who manages to
hack into photon or prism (and yes, it has happened) to set up a fake
pgp asking for the passphrase to my key.
I usually dial in to poly, I don't have (yet) a unix box on the net
to make signing easy.  Until the DOS or Mac versions of PGP include
a built in terminal and mailer...

You're not in any way related to Detweiler are you? :-)

Sorry I took so long.   It's hard having much time left over after
getting a job as a novell network administrator (though it's lots
of fun.)
Anyway, for anyone who is interested in Medusa, I hope you can use
finger.  If you can't, we'll arange something else...
Anyhow, just pipe the output of finger to uudecode in the background
and that should do the trick...  ie:
  finger rarachel at photon.poly.edu | uudecode
And hope it works.  This should generate a file called medusa1b.zip
which is a beta version complete with sources.
Sometime in the future, I will ftp this program to the usual sites...
But first I need some free time. :-)

@_subject: if this is RC4 
This might explain the char % 255's in the code.  Normally such a construct is dangerous if the machine/compiler you use uses 2 byte
"chars" and there's the slightest posibility of having your "char"
hold more than 255.  I would normally use char & 255, however it
may surprise some of us that some machines can do a MOD faster than
an AND and the compiler used might have exploited that feature.
However, reconstructing C code out of binaries is a pain and I
doubt that you'd see a header file as well as a main .c file...
Anyone have experience with decompilers?

Oh brother, here we go again.  Now the bandits are not only going to listen in
for the serial numbers of the phone, but they'll listen in for (what?) touch
tones of the block out numbers passwords?
This has certainly not stopped promiscous mode ethernet sniffers from grabbing
passwords, and I doubt it would long keep the bandits out... :-(
If only these guys would wake up and use strong crypto...  This is a perfect
example of a government caused fucked up on a grand scale due to the fact that
we now have an installed base of millions of insecure cell phones and cell
stations.   It's probably not too late for the cell companies to start
introducing crypto cell phones, but the longer they wait, the harder the switch,
and what's worse is that they've taken the attitude that "So what if we loose
millions, we'll just raise the prices and get it all back anyway."
You certainly won't find me sporting a cell phone until we get something a bit
more secure.  :-I  At least the beeper black market isn't as vicious...

Not quite.  If the socieities or guilds in question were to wake up to the
threat, they could easily have whatever institution issued certificates of
passing/degrees/etc. and sign them with their keys.   The licensee would
then attach his e-diploma to his .plan file for anyone to finger and verify
the signature.
So, there, on the internet, being a quack and getting away with it doesn't
have to happen. :-)
