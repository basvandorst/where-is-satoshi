A few months back, some winos took most of Minnesota off the net
for a couple days. Upset with being kicked out from under a bridge,
they started a fire that took out the main fiber cable from downtown to MRNet + the U of M. Backup? Due to a mistake at a CO,
the backup link was routed thru the same area, and was also burned.
Interesting scrambling as nameservers puked and died.  Mutant Rob said:
