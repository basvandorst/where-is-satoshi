@_subject: A liitle late but I just saw this... 
I happened to see your recent posting, and since I'm interested in the  cyberwar issue (including having served as co-chair of the DOE "Human  Factors" breakout group charged with considering cyberwar and cyber  terrorism for the DOE Cyber Security Research Needs for Open Science  meeting, see session 4 of  panels/ ). With that for context...
I'm not sure folks fully understand how strategic cyberwar might/will  actually be waged. In my opinion, cyberwar will not rely primarily on  malware-based attacks. :-; That process is too uncertain, too slow,  too-readily thwarted and would have insufficient penetration or  So how might cyberwar happen? Let me give you three examples:
1) We are already experiencing a sort of cyberwar, although because it  began gradually, and has become a chronic phenomenon, no one  acknowledges the negative impact and damage it continually causes to  our economy -- and that is spam. What a perfect attack eh? How much  time is wasted filtering and deleting spam? How many business-critical  messages get blocked or overlooked? How many resources are diverted  from other potentially productive uses? What a great way of promoting  illegal use of controlled substances, too, thereby helping to subvert  the nation's war on drugs.
And yet, because this is an attack of a trillion mosquitos rather than  a frontal attack by a roaring bear, we don't even acknowledge it as an  attack, and there's no way to definitively tie this attack to a  hostile government -- absolute deniability!
2) Tactical cyberwar would certainly include attacks against control  systems; if you're interested you can see my take on this issue at  (or .pdf)
3) Full-blown strategic cyberwar, worst case, would involve things  like high altitude electromagnetic pulse-induced damage to terrestrial  networks and power distribution grids, while simultaneously degrading  or destroying non-radiation-hardened satellites aloft.
If you're interested, please also feel free to see my talk, "Planning  for Certain High Risk Security Incidents,"  (or .pdf) from the fall  2007 Internet2 Member Meeting in San Diego,  where I urge adoption of a program of hardening critical assets to  resist H-EMP.
Feel free to drop me a note if you have any questions,

@_subject: [cryptography] Client TLS Certificates - why not? 
strife asked:
 anyone enlighten me why client TLS certificates are used so rarely? It
 to be a hassle in the past, but now at least the major browsers offer
 decent client cert support, Not quite seeing eye-to-eye with you on the "quite decent client cert support" point, I'm afraid. Client cert user interaction still deserves
poor marks for complexity and user opacity, I think.
I did a preconference seminar for Educause Security Professionals 2012 on
client certificates, and it's actually sort of surprising how deeply buried
many bits of the current browser client cert implementation are. See
Or consider the level of native OS support for USB format PKI hard tokens
or smart cards on some operating systems, just to mention another example
of how client certificate support is still not really ready for prime time
at this point.
[In fact, if anyone's looking for a nice paper topic, I think a terrific
topic might be "Why Johnny Can't Ecrypt Using Client Certs, Either"
modeled on  ]
 seeing how most people struggle with passwords, I don't see why  certs could not be beneficial even to "ordinary users".
Client certs *could* be hugely beneficial to even ordinary users -- imagine their use for EAP-TLS authentication, for example. The devil, as always, is in the details.
Assume the average person has multiple devices these days -- maybe a desktop at work, a laptop for travel, a tablet at home, a smartphone, etc.
If I want to use client certs for encryption/decryption, I need the *same*
cert on all of those devices, or on a portable device (such as a USB-format PKI hard token, or a smart card) so I can take my credentials with me. Sync'ing certs from one device to another isn't totally impossible, but backing up, manually transfering and reinstalling certs on multiple devices
really isn't simple enough for most mere mortals. [Attempts to deploy a unique client cert to each device have issues of their own that we'll skip for the purposes of this note]
Smart cards or USB-format PKI hard tokens are a nice alternative, but somewhat expensive, and you can't just run down to your favorite local
office supply store or neighborhood compute supply store and buy one.
Then there's the fact that not all devices easily accomodate USB-format
PKI hard tokens or smart cards, but if you *are* able to use a USB format PKI hard token or smart card, at least the credentials stored on those devices can be stored in a non-exportable format, which is good given the uptick in malware's that has reportedly been scraping client certs of late.
Smart cards or hard tokens are also required if you're shooting for the
highest NIST LOAs, but there's so much more that's required to get there
that in many ways the use of smart cards or hard tokens is a minor matter relative to identity proofing requirements and all the rest of
what's require -- and it's hard to find anyone who actually needs LOA-4,
at least in higher ed.
Speaking of identity proofing, many times client certs only map to email
addresses, not to "real names," and not to guaranteed-unique and never-to-be-reused arbitrary identifiers (like the EPPN). Some may find that choice less than full satisfactory.
Or let's talk about key servers/directory models. Let me wave my magic
wand and magically create an Internet-wide directory for client certs,
perhaps modeled on PGP public key servers. Unfortunately, I don't see much interest in fielding an animal of that sort, and w/o it, you're
either reduced to enterprise-level directories, or the painful process
of requesting a signed message to bootstrap key exchange for encryption
purposes (yuck)
And the list goes on...
Bottom line, I think that there's still a lot of work ahead if you want
to do client certs at scale...
