This country has become a very scary place.

Yes, they do care. But, I don't understand exactly why they care since unauthorised e-commerce transactions end up being the liability of the merchant and the credit card company. It is usually just an
annoyance for the customer.
Of course, 128 bit SSL gives customers a false sense of security. The CC number is protected over the wire between their desktop and the web server, but customers have no clue what happens to their CC number after that. If the web server has been compromised, it doesn't matter much what sort of over-the-wire encryption you use. The customer generally has little idea of how the merchant stores CC numbers and what measures are in place to protect them.

FidoNet, ugh. Would the software even work under most current operating systems?
uucp still lives in pretty much every UNIX and UNIX-like operating system and it moves email well. It would be a simple matter to get uucp going for a mail link with
some sort of over the wire encryption. It has been about ten years since I've dealt with this, but as I recall each email message went
via a uux of rmail (uux was remote command execution - sort of like
rsh over a modem). There is no particular reason why one couldn't
encrypt before sending and decrypt upon receipt. Mostly just a
modification to sendmail.cf and a modification to rmail. Of course
this really just solves the problem for a single hop uucp link.
People did a lot of multi-hop uucp. I remember trying to work out the right "bang path" to get mail across the country to people I was corresponding with quickly. Of course, you end up with the same problems. Traffic can be monitored. multi-hop uucp means there are lots of very easy interception points. This doesn't really get around the whole problem, uucp is just something different to monitor, still subject to traffic analysis, and you'd need real end to end encryption of email messages via something like pgp/gpg anyway. The only thing a large multi-hop uucp network would give us is that it would allow us to do is decentralise and control our own mail paths, so monitoring would be harder, in that sense. In a large enough network, one could even use a different path for each message. I wonder if my old Telebit modem still works. It is in a box somewhere...

So what about all the civilians in Afghanistan who are being killed by American and British bombs.
They aren't being killed because they are soldiers, or because
they support the Taliban, or because they hate the U.S.A.
They are killed simply because the U.S. and a few other countries are attacking and they happened to be sitting in their homes, caring for their children, eating, sleeping, etc. So are most of the Afghan civilians who are being killed doing anything to the U.S., U.K., Canada, etc.? I think not.
The devil in this is the old cliche, "the end justifies the means". This kind of thinking allows people to destroy the WTC, kill thousands of innocents in the U.S.A. and Afghanistan, allows the police in so called "civilized" first world countries to imprison, and torture people who have been charged with no crime (let alone convicted), and allows lawmakers to pass draconian legislation that will lead to more abuses of civil rights. It is a very simple trick of the mind with devestating consequences - once you allow yourself to forget that a particular person or group of people are actual human beings, who live, experience joy, and suffer just as we all do, any sort of brutality in support of a cause (revenge, justice, freedom, etc.) becomes relatively easy to inflict. I'll end this with a pointer to a well written insightful article about "the war"  -  Mark Henderson, mch at squirrel.com, mch at informationanarchy.org

Ah, so even though collateral damage is the inevitable consequence of war, that makes it all OK. I get it. So what for the suffering of thousands in pursuit of revenge? "The end justifies the means". Right. If a million people have to die, be maimed, or lose family members so that Bin Laden can be captured you're OK with that.
That's a good defence. Just label the people whose opinions you don't like as a "bunch of commies". Then you don't need to take them seriously. I'm impressed.
You seem to forget there are people in the left who are for restructuring of society so that there is much less government,
and less power centralised in the hands of a few.
