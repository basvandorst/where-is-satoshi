@_subject: Some Questions... 
of questions:
1)  How is it that I sign a message with PGP and still have the message be in plaintext?  I know this is trivial to most, but new to me.
2)  I know that there were programs out there that would break the protection scheme for ZIP and ARJ files (older versions of both), is there new ones out and what are their keys based on?
