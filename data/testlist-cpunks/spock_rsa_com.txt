Hello Ralph,
Thanks for your interest in S/MIME.  A couple of minor corrections to your comparison seem to be in order.
S/MIME integrates PKCS  and  message services (not PEM) into MIME.
Although the description of this format is accurate, this format is only documented as an option, not the primary signature format.  This option has been supplied for backward compatability to address a mixed (S/MIME-aware and non-S/MIME aware) audience of recipients.  The primary signature format is a PKCS  signed message (including signed MIME content) carried in a single body part: application/x-pkcs7-mime.
