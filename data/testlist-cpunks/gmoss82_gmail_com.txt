You have selective amnesia . I said I want people who drive smog-belching one or two ton potential homicide machines to have a certification in homicide avoidance. It's called a "Drivers License" and albeit it doesn't preclude homicide on the part of the certified it helps provide justification-for-the-crushed that the person who did it knew how not to do so.

Great, "Greg." Log on to the IP address, click on journal. Prepare to buy
new hard disk, hopelessly try to clean out back-ups, avoid for life the
suckers you infected.
Then try to get out of jail from the phishing gangsters who entrapped you by
getting into your TEMPEST-hardened computer setup and threatening to send to
your relatives and customers their implanted vile kiddie porn collection as
if yours and report to the FBI "Greg's" vast cache of stolen celebrity
accounts and hundreds of nyms, Tor logs, USG break-ins, counterfeit
Bitcoins, comsec dirty work, rattings to LE, and, listen, hear what's
buzzing over your bunker. battering your steel gate.

This is all child's-play. A couple of years ago a company called Persistent Systems was discovered to have been doing full-time 24/7/365 Wide Area Surveillance of ALL OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY for the LASD. They changed their name to Dojo Technlogy to avoid the publicity.
Locally they were noted by yours truly as the company that does the surveillance system for the local transit station (bus). They're probably also responsible for sat-tracking the buses which has been ongoing for literally decades.
Again, full-time 24/7/365 Wide Area Surveillance of ALL OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY at a price the LASD could afford. Why waste money on aviation fuel?
