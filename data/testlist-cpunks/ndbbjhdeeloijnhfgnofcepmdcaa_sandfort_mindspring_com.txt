References: That's not really what I'm trying to say.  The question is, is it possible for a ruling to be valid under common law and invalid under the constitution.  I think the answer is no and the reason (as you may have been trying to say) is that the constitution is a part of common law, and all decisions since it's creation have, by definition, been either constitutional or overruled on appeal.
