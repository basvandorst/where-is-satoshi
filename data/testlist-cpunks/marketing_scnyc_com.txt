 	 Getting the Most From Your Relationship
with a Contingency Search Firm by Bob Marshall, Recruitment Educator Like any successful relationship with a consultant, working with a
contingency recruiter will be more productive when each party
understands how the other works.
When choosing a recruiter, look for someone with a proven track record
within your industry. This person will possess qualities such as
intelligence, creativity, honesty, persistence, organizational skills
and a sense of corporate maturity. They should also be good listeners
and have an innate ability to "read" people.

 	 The Value of Realistic Performance Standards by Terry Petra
Realistic performance standards provide both management and staff with a
critically important measuring tool. Without this tool, managers cannot
effectively direct and support the efforts of their staff and the staff
cannot effectively manage their time and resources.

Slump bloopers and blunders of staffing firms
by Tom Hand Slow growth is not a decline in market size. The dollars are still there
and some staffing company, somewhere, is receiving them. Our economy has
endured a "recession" about once a decade for the last two hundred
years. The best firms use old techniques to prosper in a slow growth
scenario. ( click here

Using your Summer/Vacation recruiting "downtime" wisely
By W.J. Boczany, principal Generally, candidates and clients are busy with vacation planning and
other distractions and often the hiring process takes a back seat to
these lighter hearted events. Although we all need to share in the
holiday spirit, it is important that we use our holiday down time
wisely. While our access to candidates and clients may be difficult
there still are a lot of things that we can do to prepare for vacation
time. Here are just a few ( click here

 ) Why Managers Condone Incompetence by Terry Petra
There is one thing worse than hiring the wrong person. That is to hang
on to the employee long after the evidence indicates you should let them
go. This is a problem that challenges managers at all levels of the
organizational ladder.

begin this monograph by simply stating that most managers, at one time
or another, find themselves in a situation where they have an employee
who should be terminated and yet, the manager takes no action. It may be
a problem of unacceptable performance, poor attendance, negative
attitude or lack of congruence between the manager?s primary operating
style and the functional preferences of the employee.

By Mike Ramer, CPC
Recruiters from all sectors of the employment industry will relate to
these points
Being able to determine the quality of a search assignment before you
"work it" is more critical today than any time in the past decade. What if you were to take on a search assignment that wasn't a quality
one? You could spend weeks, even months, before finding out that: 1) the position was put on hold, 2) an internal candidate filled the
job, 3) the company found the choice candidate through another source, 4) you're really looking for a "needle in a haystack," 5) the company isn't financially stable and can't pay your fee and/or 6) another reason spent your valuable time, which could have been used
to work better assignments. Mike provides a simple recipe to avoid wastingyour time
