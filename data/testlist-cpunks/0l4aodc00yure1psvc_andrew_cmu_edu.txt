My take on the situation, from cyberia and WELL discussions, is that if
a book is banned under French law, it may be difficult to sue for
copyright violations. (Intuitively, this sorta makes sense. If you are
*unable* to sell it, what damages are there?) Also, international law
would require that the copyright holder sue in my local U.S. court.
I have not heard from either the publisher or author, even though French
ISPs have linked to my page and it's been getting a decent amount of
traffic. Interestingly, almost all the comments I've received have been
positive -- only two negative responses, including one email bombing
attempt. I would be interested to know what the publisher and author's
perspectives are on this. Reports from France indicate that the
publisher, Plon, is *not* going to sue the guy who first put it online.
I'm not too worried about France, but I'm having second thoughts about
Germany. Let's just say I'm not planning a vacation there anytime soon.
Thanks, Tim. I haven't actually spoken to my attorney (the former head
of the local ACLU) about this, and perhaps I should have. *sigh* He'll
probably yell at me for getting involved in yet another controversy...
