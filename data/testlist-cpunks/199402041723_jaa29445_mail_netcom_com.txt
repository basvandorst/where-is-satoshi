Rather than try to run in some asynchronous mode as you suggest, why
not do the following when each message arrives:
   place message in your queue, designating random hold time
   foreach message in the queue that's been held long enough
         send random number (1<=n<=3) dummy messages
         send the queued message
         send random number (1<=n<=5) dummy messages
The whole thing remains data-driven while you're not logged in
and can be manually flushed if you are logged in.  So long as
there is a steady stream of traffic, messages won't get stalled
for long times.  You could even send some 'activation' messages
at controlled intervals from some comfortable site (where you can
use cron), routed via another remailer.
Just some ideas off the top of my head.
