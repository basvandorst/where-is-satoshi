The acceptable distance from a stable currency, as the concept of good
enough, depends again on what you are trying to achieve.
As a digital currency, and distributed system, Bitcoin is nothing less
than truly ingenious. I'm enthusiast about it.
However, Bitcoin it's neither local nor should be confused with a
system ready to be a sound alternative to the gold standard. And in
the debate was rised a question about the eventual effect of having
money backed by BTCs instead of gold. My argument stems from there.
Btw, there's a nice article published few weeks ago by Nathan Lewis on Forbes:

Hi David,
Absolutely, thanks for asking. Cryptographic counters were introduced
by Jonathan Katz, Steven Myers, and Rafail Ostrovsky in a work where
they especially addressed their applications to electronic voting. So,
I suppose its relevance makes the paper a good candidate for a
  'Cryptographic Counters and Applications to Electronic Voting',
  Eurocrypt 2001, Though cryptocounters may find application as subroutines in
electronic voting system (more below), the possibility to use them as
useful building blocks ultimately depends upon the requirements
engineering for electronic vote (e.g., is coercion resistance a
Sorry for the confusion. Let me rephrase the section.
Lets consider a secure electronic voting where each participant holds
a binary vote, which is either 0 or 1. We want to compute the tally
without revealing the individual votes. A secure protocol to compute
the sum of integers can be of help here. Votes, actually their
randomized encryptions, are terms of the addition. The addition can be
computed privately using an additive homomorphic cryptographic scheme,
hence providing means to privately cast the participants' votes. To
compute the tally, the voting authority -- which may inlcude
participants themselves -- decrypt the cryptographic counter and
publish the final result.
Lately, I've been working with a company interested in applying
cryptocounters and building an application where privacy is taken care
of by design. I'll do my best to help them delivering their project.
Perhaps they will decide to write something about this in the future.
At the same time, there are few application of cryptocounters,
unrelated to electronic voting and my current engagements, suggested
by Adam Young and Moti Yung in their Malicious Cryptography (J. Wiley)
and the upcoming Advances in Cryptovirology
But I'm pretty confident we could devise more applications.

@_subject: Red Pike cipher 
References: <92e6e17e1f1db50b11c13c4a4ca9c25c
Le limited information available on the Red Pike cipher are quite
consistent with the code below: an ARX block cipher, no look-up
tables, virtually no key schedule, and requiring only few lines of
code [1].
With a 64 bit key size the Alleged Red Pike (ARP) is insecure by
modern standards. But it was possibly insecure also in the 1990s.
ARP suffers from a large number of semi-weak keys. Actually, each key
is a semi-weak key. A pair of ARP keys (K1, K2) is said to be
semi-weak if E_K1(E_K2(M)) = M (i.e., encryption with K1 operates as
does decryption with K2). With ARP Feistel structure and its key
schedule,there are 2^63 such pairs, reducing the size of the key space
to 2^63.
The relationship between each semi-weak pairs is:
  K2_L = K1_R - 2^32/phi * 17
  K2_R = K1_L + 2^32/phi * 17
where phi is the golden ratio.
Being semi-weak keys a large fraction of the ARP key space,
implementations cannot apply the standard countermeasures against this
undesirable property. Picking a semi-weak key is inevitable.
The question remains: Is the Alleged Red Pike the cipher designed by the GCHQ?
