I thought I'd ask how the list is going... it seems to have gone
downhill; there are now totally gratoitous insults to tcmay that
don't seem to serve any purpose besides making sure the archive
(if there is one) isn't fit for family viewing.
Hey, at least when I was insensitive, I put effort into it. And
I didn't use an automatic daemon.
Anyway, I thought I'd catch up on current events with the following
* I take it SSL still hasn't been strengthened?
* I'm now working part of the time at a company that has a lot of
mail-order sales; are any of you aware of how much credit card fraud is
going on out there right now? Might some of this actually be from unsecure
SSL transactions?
* Did anyone come up with any interesting embellishments (or maybe
precedents?) to my bidirectional Dining Cryptographers idea? I can't
believe I'm the first to come up with this... I guess it's public domain
now, since I missed the one-year deadline for patenting it.

But the cutoff is often whether the parents can afford to send their kids
to private school, not whether or not they're genetically superior.
And the reason it costs so much to send a kid to private school is that
everyone's already paying for a more expensive public school thanks to all
the taxes.
So if I'm economically successful it'll change my genes?

It sounds to me like your argument abstracts thusly:
"Personally, I fail to see the point to the development of more powerful
computers, since I can always steal time from other people's current
technology computers."
One could make this statement about _all_ advances in processor
technology. And it boils down to this: you're not paying for it, so you
don't see the point in getting more bang for the buck. People who are
paying for it, and have neither the inclination nor the ability to steal,  do see the point of getting more bang for the buck. And eventually even
you'll benefit, when you find yourself writing a java applet to freeload
processor time on someone else's DNA computer. Meanwhile, processor
technology will have advanced because many people went out and paid for
faster (Intel/PowerPC/PowerDNA/Whatever) CPU's. Not because you freeloaded
off of someone else. Phil Fraering          The above is the opinion of neither my internet

Of course, one area where the doctor will continue to hold a patient's
records, instead of the patient, due to the nature of the current system:
Prescription medication.
Of course, with the really big problems with this stuff, drug
interactions, there's still no system for a doctor to find out what you're
on thanks to another doctor. Which is why it's very important to always
use the same pharmacist.

I guess the final word on assasination politics would be obvious:
It's widely believed that the New Orleans Mafia (the source of my recent

in the assasination of the late President John F. Kennedy.

Stop wallowing around in determinism if you expect to get anywhere.
Without vouchers, you don't say anything about the intelligence of your
test subjects; to a _very_ large degree, intelligence isn't genetic. Or
it helps for the first five minutes, but after that you're on your own.

Oh. That organization. I thought it was simply because the topic had been
done to death.
Speaking of topics being done to death, I'm probably going to cease my
subscription to cypherpunks as soon as my subscription to the filtered
list is confirmed. (Which is why I'm not following up to Vulis' messages
any more... the conversation would probably stop anyway when I stopped
seeing his half of the messages, and I probably wouldn't see mine on
the filtered list anyway...)
This brings up something else: the last time I tried to find the
cypherpunks archives on a web search they didn't show up.
The last time I accessed them was in March, and they were kind-of sick
then... I guess things just got too bad for the archival scheme to handle?

You're absolutely correct about the informed patient bit;  I have
developed the policy of checking the PDR entry for any medication I take. And found out about some interactions my doctor didn't tell me about.
There's a paradox about Andy Grove's situation: if he starts browsing
medical databases and someone can analyze his traffic, or scans his
traffic on a closed but not encrypted private email support group, they
can deduce much about his condition. Now since everyone else knows about
Grove's situation anyway (I suppose he talked about it) and it was brought
up regarding my comments about pharmaceutical interactions (and in those
comments I was acting reflexively towards a phobia about medical
interactions) it's a moot point concerning the medical side and his
privacy information; but the privacy angle still needs to be considered in
the general case:
In order for someone to do this in complete privacy, encryption would have
to be ubiquitous; the norm, rather than the exception it is now.
There aren't records of who looks up something in the PDR at your local
library, but an ISP could gather much info about its users from what sites
they frequent...
