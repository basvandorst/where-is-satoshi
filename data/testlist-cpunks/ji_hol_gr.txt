@_subject: is there a FAQ 
Use the setsa program provided in the utils directory. Something along
the lines of
should do the trick. It was really a choice between distributing the code and lingering on it for a few more days until the docs were better, and I chose
the first. Bsides, the source *is* the ultimate documentation :-)

@_subject: question on setting up for ipsec/linux 
I'm away from Greece until the end of february. Some questions I may be
able to answer, but I don't have the ipsec code with me, nor do I have
a setup where I can test things. Here are some tips that may help you though.
* The code has been tested under 2.0.27 and 2.0.28. It will probably run
on kernels down to 2.0.24. It will not even load with 2.1.x. * Only "tunnel mode" works. I'm waiting for a few more chances to occur
to the 2.1.x routing code before I move the IPSEC code to 2.1.x and implement transport mode.
* While not reflectedected in the (excuse for) documentation, I *have*
tested all the modes for all the transforms. Of course, I may have interpreted the I-Ds in the wrong way, but I don't think so. The following
transforms are supported:
Please not that the des-md5 and 3des-md5 have this weird concept of the Initiator
and Responder. Since we're still doing manual keying anyway, it doesn't
matter much wich side is which, and it doesn't even matter which if both
sides are Is or Rs. The information is onlyl used to derive the
encryption and authentication keys, the IV and the counter, from the
(hopefully) negotiated shared secret. If all else fails, set both sides to
be Initiators, and this way you won't have to think about which "setsa"
lines get an r and which get an i.
I'll try to write up som e more docs when I'm back in Athens, but if
someone else from Europe could do it, it would be good.

@_subject: DES and RSA crypto hardware from the free world 
I believe uti-Maco (a belgian company) has been using the Pijnenburg chips
for their boards. However, last I checked with them (about half a year ago)
the price of the boards was pretty steep -- of the order of $1K. Anyway, if the boards Peter is referring to are ready in the next couple of months, I volunteer to write drivers for Linux and *BSD*.
