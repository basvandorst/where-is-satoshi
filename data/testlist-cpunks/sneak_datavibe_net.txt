Nothing could be further from the truth.  Mining/Minting operations have
little/nothing to do with the viability of the network itself.  It's a novel
way of dealing with inflation, but, if anything, the easy availability of
cheap and fast GPUs is accelerating adoption.
Opportunists will quickly drive the profit from generating down to almost
exactly that of the power costs, but that's to be expected.  They are also the
driving force behind a free market.  Or do you think they are killing those,
too? :)

is something to think about.
bitcoins for about 6 months now.  About 2-3 months ago, it stopped generating
network and is hording/generating all the bitcoins.  I say this because the
amount of chatter on the bitcoin forums in regards to GPUs vs CPUs has
exploded, and new GPU clients are being released.
For those who are wondering if it's worth trying to generate bitcoins, here is
something to think about.
I bought an overpriced GPU for $700 (apparently they are closer to $500 from
other sellers) that generates about 50 bitcoins a day on the LOW end.
Bitcoins being worth approximately $0.25 USD (also on the low end), this card
generates $12.50 a day for approximately $0.70/day in electricity.  Both of
these figures (how often it generates bitcoins, as well as how much coins are
worth) will, without question, change radically in the next 90 days.
Minting is not essential to the liquidity of bitcoins.  If you are interested
in using them, anyone can log on to any of the exchanges (of which I think
mtgox.com is the largest) and purchase coins instantly.  Their utility is not
defined by "how easily can one make them out of thin air", but instead by "are
there people who accept these as valuable".
There are thousands of bitcoins available for sale, and thousands of Liberty
Reserve dollars available as bids.  The market, while small, is liquid and
becoming more so every day.
Also, this shadowy "someone" you speak of is sitting in the bitcoin-dev irc
channel, and I think he's up to about 20 GPUs at this point.  Still, his
effect on the market only strengthens the cryptographic underpinnings of
bitcoin.  It doesn't affect anyone else, as the network regularly
re-calibrates (as part of the bitcoin protocol) to ensure that no matter how
many GPUs are running, there is a fixed rate of 50-coins-per-ten-minutes of

This guy doesn't know that The Silk Road is a hidden service that can _only_
be accessed via Tor - and he further doesn't know the difference between
"elicit" and "illicit".
Why are we reading him, again?

You are.  The moment that they stop doing that, the legitimate network
overtakes it and restores order.  It would have to be a sustained attack until
all users of the network had abandoned it.
Furthermore, it is really only a minor denial-of-service, because solving 100%
of the blocks going forward only allows you to deny confirmation of the
transactions of others, and to double-spend your own pre-existing coins.
The moment the attack stops, the legitimate network would begin catching up,
and would soon overtake it.
