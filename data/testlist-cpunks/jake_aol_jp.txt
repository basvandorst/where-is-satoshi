My request comes from the fact that, as far as I know, you cannot use a QR code to pay POS at an establishment, say at like 7/11. People easily become more well antiquated with quick POS payment methods. I.E. (not in chronological order) Charlie cards in boston, the upcoming paypass enabled NYC subway turnstiles (they completed a trial a little while back), the mobil speedpass which has been around for years ( and then most recently NFC enabled payment terminals popping up everywhere in the US. Anyone can apply for an NFC (really RFID, but same tapping concept...) enabled credit/debit cards easily now:    I'm sorry, but you cannot tell me NFC is uncommon functionality. Three to four of Sprint's cellphone are now NFC enabled; I'm sure other carriers are simultaneously following suit. Familiarity with tapping to pay will reach the masses through mobile phones, if it hasn't already through the card companies ...
