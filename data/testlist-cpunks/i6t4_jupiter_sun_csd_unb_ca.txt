I have been 'introducing' my friends to PGP too... I figure that its no
good if I have a key, but no one to use it with...  :-)  Its amazing how
many people will take the time to play with an interesting new toy...
I'm not too sure here... but PGP should default to using the newest
(youngest) key on you private key ring...  If you have two of them with
the same name, I'm not sure how you could choose other than the first... The trick here might be to a a key size option to PGP, to say I want the
key that is (or is at least) n bits in size.
I'll not get into computer wars...  I'll just say that I'll take an Amiga
over an IBM clone any day!  >;-)  As far as I can tell.. there are folx
out there that make sure the Amiga version goes public pretty soon after a
new version is released...  I've hade 2.2 since about 3 days after I knew
it was released...  There are a series on AmiNet "mirrors" all over the
world, the one that most IBM'ers would recognize right off being
wuarchive.wustle.edu (128.252.135.4) in /pub/aminet/util/crypt. I have some options on some of your ideas, but I'll save them for another
post at another time..  :-)

I may have missed something, but I don't see where synchronization is a
concern.  The whole of idea of Kermit is to provide a "binary" path
between two computers.  It is Kermit's responsibility to ensure the data
is received in the same order as sent (sychronization is part of the
Kermit protocol, no?).  If we have a data stream coming from
a keyboard or whatever, which we run through an invertable encryption
algorithm, and then pipe it into Kermit which makes sure it gets to the
other side, Kermit need not know where the data is coming from.  The other
side of course has to know the protocol and the key...  I believe that
Kermit allows variable sized packets per file transferred, but does it
allow the packet size to vary during the transfer?  I'd have to go find my
Kermit protocol reference on that one.  You would want this, as well as a
relaxed timing on the protocol, if its to come from the keyboard, as a
user does not (and/or cannot) normally type as a consistant rate...

@_subject: A link encryption protocol to crytique ;-) 
Okay folx, tear this apart...  I running on little sleep, but after
thinking about this for a couple of hours (mostly while trying to document
it...) I can't see any obvious holes...
If no one points out any significant deterrants, I will code this up in C
and release the code to the public domain (I'll get it put on soda...)
I should comment, that this is not meant to be the best link encryption
protocol available...  the NSA (or others of their TLA friends) can
monitor my sessions if they really want to...  but this should at least
provide a minor stumbling block...
Also, I'm not a math major, so my version of a "technical" description of
how to do this may upset the mathematicians among us... I did it the way
it is cause it seem straight forward that way...  I hope it actually makes
sense to someone besides me...  I hope it is general enuff (while writing
this I had fixed values in mind, like 256 byte packets, so I may have let
some of the constants creep in without noticing...   I hope not, please
point out these things)...
Anyway, here it is, for whatever its worth...  Oh, for irony's sake, I
must admit that it was all the "clipper" discussion that got me thinking,
and the use of I1 & I2 reflect this...  hehehehe!

Protocol proposal for a peer to peer encrypted link
The goal of this algorithm was to be fast and not easily subject to a known
plaintext attack, as the data bytes in B[] will be highly structured.
x^y=the result of x exclusive ORed with y
v[x..y]=a vector with positions indexed from x up to y (inclusive)
v[i]=index into an an vector v for position i
v[]=the list of all values in vector v
CRC(v[])=caculate a CRC checksum on the data bytes in vector v
N=number of user data bytes per packet
D=N+sizeof(CRC(B[]))  (for ease in generating I, should be a power of 2)
B[0..N-1]=the N user data bytes
C[0..D-1]=a work buffer filled from B[], CRC(B[])
P[0..S-1]=the outgoing packet
K1 & K2=two random "session" keys of length P
I=packet rearrange index (range of 0 up to D-1)
I1 & I2=the two generators of I (range of 0 up to D-1)
T[0..(2^sizeof(I))-1]=array of vectors of size D
L=number of times to iterate the shuffle function
total size of data        D=N              +
                            sizeof(CRC(B[]))
total size of each packet S=sizeof(I)*2    +
                            N              +
                            sizeof(CRC(B[]))
Exchanged in advance of any packets being sent (by a public key mechanism
for example) are N, sizeof(I), sizeof(CRC(B[])), K1, K2, T.
K1 and K2 are generated randomly, but checked to insure that K1[i] does not
equal K2[i].
T[i] is generated by a pseudo random process, similar to shuffling a deck of
cards.  For each i, fill the vector with the values 0 to D-1.  Then two random
indexes (j & k) are chosen (to be different) and the two values at
T[i,j] and T[i,k] are swapped.  This can be iterated an arbitraty number of
times (L) to ensure a good "shuffle" of the values.
To encrypt each packet P:
   - Generate a random index (I) by generating two random values for
     I1 and I2 and exclusive OR'ing them together.  I is not transmitted
     as part of the packet
   - Copy the values in B[i] to C[T[I,i]] for all values of i=0 up to N-1.
   - Copy the individual bytes from CRC(B[]) into C by indexing T[I,x]
     for x=N up to D-1.
   - Form the packet:  P[0..D-1]=C[], P[D..D+sizeof(I)-1]=I1,
     P[D+sizeof(I)..S-1]=I2
   - Replace each value of P[i] with P[i]^K1[i]^K2[i] for all values of
     i=0..S-1.
   - Transmit P[i] for all values i=S-1 down to 0.
Explanatory comments:
   - Exclusive OR was chosen beacuse it executes so quickly on most machines.
   - The asumption was that just using a single key K1 would not be strong
     enough, so thus there are two.
   - Sending I as I1 and I2 gives more appranent choices of values, without
     requiring T to be extremely large.  This is in hopes of further
     hindering any known plaintext attacks.
   - P is transmitted backwards merely so that I1 & I2 arrive first, to aide
     the decryption process.  (Quite honestly this was done to make the
     above description of the assemblage of P a little easier to write,
     as putting I1 & I2 in first would have meant more calculation to yield
     the offsets of the sub parts of P  eg. "P[0..D-1]=C[] would have become
     "P[sizeof(I)..sizeof(I)+D-1]=C[]" which is not as easily understood.)
To decrypt each packet P:
   - As each byte comes in, it is stored into P[i] for values of
     i=S-1 down to 0.
   - Replace each value of P[i] with P[i]^K1[i]^K2[i] for all values of
     i=0..S-1.
   - I1=P[D..D+sizeof(I)-1]=I1, I2=P[D+sizeof(I)..S-1].
   - I=I1^I2.
   - C[]=P[0..D-1]=C[].
   - Copy the values in C[T[I,i]] to B[i] for all values of i=0 up to N-1.
   - Verify that CRC(B[]) equals C indexed T[I,x] for x=N up to D-1.
   - If the CRC verifies, the the data values have been transmitted and
     reside in B[] to be used.

@_subject: 800 numbers 
Of course, only Americans can dial those numbers.. which is a shame...  (A
few Canadians could have skewed the voting... :-)
On a note similar to remailers, has anyone ever given consideration to
creating an "outdial" service?  If I could dial long distance into the
States, and then be able to dial a 1-800 number that I cannot dial direct
from Canada (which is most) this would extremely useful...  Could be taken
a step further, and with automated billing a person could dial *any*
number and charge it back to their calling card (though this would not be
fully anonymous, is there a use for this??  I donno... as Caller ID
becomes more prevalent... maybe...)   I know law enforcement agents
use something like this for undercover operations, though I doubt they
figure in a long distance factor very often...  Anyway, something to think

{I have been reading the list for about a week now...  This is my first
post...  I hope this is not a FAQ...}
I am looking for solutions to a situation that people may find familiar...
Say you have a text file that contains sensitive configuration data (in a
particular case, the cross-index of anonymous ids and real mail addresses)
taht you want a program to be able to read, but you want it stored in
encrypted format.  (Which means you will decrypt it each time you read it,
and rewrite it in encrypted form when needed.  It will only exist in
decrypted in the computers RAM.)  Is there some sort of scheme that will
allow this, without having to have a user present to enter the password at
startup (a pain if its supposed to be an unattended program, such as a
remailer) or having the password compiled into the program...
Also, I have seen a number of references to DC nets...  I must confess I
have never heard of the term before...  can someone enlighten me?

@_subject: Some source code for phone number coding... 
Here is a couple of message about my phone encoding format (giving
progressively more info to a person trying to guess the format) followed
by the complete source...  Use it well.  (TABsize was 3.)
Okay, well without giving you the source...  heres the biggest hint I can
think of...
0	string		\037\235	compressed data
Translating that to decimal and in 4 byte unsigned long we get
  (\037\235\0\0 == 31,157,0,0 == 0,530,382,848
                                 ^^^^^
(503) 241-9796  ext: 09
 ^^^                 ^
 ??   ?
If you know the rules for forming (valid looking) phone numbers...
Anyway, to finially give the whole thing away...
The file that is hidden starts with these 4 bytes...
1f 9d 90 54 == 0,530,419,796
Well.. I like puzzles... (as long as the answer is eventually revealed) so
I'll let you think it over for a bit, before I send you the source... ;-)
Okay well... lets assume that all valid phone numbers must be in the form
   [2-9][0-1][0-9]  [2-9][0-9][0-9]  [0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]
This is the form of my encoding... now if you take a sample number, like
  1,234,567,890
and try encode it into a phone number, you would get
  (123) 456-7890
   ^^
And you notice that the 1 and the two are out of range...
Well.. as it happens, for 32 bit unsigned numbers the range is 0 to
4,294,967,294...  The first digit will always be 0-4, half of which are
illegal in that position, so I decided to swap the first two digits...
That doesn't fix all of the range problems, thus whenever there is an
invalid digit in position 1,2 or 4 I move it to the extension and put a
special indicator value (the higest of the legal range) in its place.
Thats the whole secret...  Code will follow soon...  :-)
 unsigned long getbytes(FILE *fp);
int main(void)
                                                  pn[3], pn[4], pn[5],
                                                  pn[6], pn[7], pn[8], pn[9]);
void putbytes(FILE *fp, unsigned long val);

Anyone know anything about Motorola's new phones (models VST 100, VST 350,
VST 550, locally priced at $179, $249 and $299 Canadian)?
This is what the ad says:
- Motorola's newest telephones add nothing to cellular, but do set a new
standard for Cordless Technology.
- The Secure Clear (tm) Technology is the only Cordless Telephone to
virtually eliminate any possibility of eaves dropping.
- Motorola Cordless Telephones project a scrambled signal making it
virtually impossible to monitor a conversation with other Cordless Phones,
scanners or baby monitors.
- The Motorola Secure Clear (tm) Cordless Phones are available in three
models:  VST 550, VST 350, VST 100.
- The New Secure Clear (tm) Cordless Telephones meet the same rigid
quality and durability standards demanded of all Motorola products.
There are pictures and feature lists... and then a phone number, which I
have been trying to get through fo 2 hours...  1-800-668-1117
{As if it was obvious... the bottom line says:
   Secure Clear (tm) and Motorola are Trademarks of Motorola Inc.}

@_subject: USENET newsreaders and cryptography: features/suggestions/questions 
I know you put a disclaimer, but I'll warn you that the above code is very
dangerous...  strcat() concatenates to its first argument, and the value
returned by getenv is not a suitable argument in this case...  the fix:
char enccmd[100];
strcpy(enccmd, getenv("CRYPTOPROGRAM"));
strcat(enccmd, " -m foobar");
However, I still find this unsatisfying, as the'-m' is probably a PGP
sepcific option, and it seems to me that a more general solution would be
either some form of template in the environment variable:
CRYPTOPROGRAM="pgp encode=-e decode= sign=-s stdin=-f text=-t ascii=-a
conventional=-c userid=-u %u forcepager=-m pagemode=-m wipeorig=-w
recoverorigfilename=-p detatchsig=-b leavesigintact=-d adresseelist=%a
...and so on..."
or a set of environment variables, such as:
...and so on...
Either way is a lot more work, but probably a lot more general as well...
This is a piece of code that only needs to be written once...  would take
more work to do the documentation that the code...  Any takers, or should I
put this on my TODO list as well?

Today, in one of those profound moments, I had a thought...  I'm still in
pain, so my therapy is to share with all of you.
Canadian money is not only colorful, its bar coded...  I'm so poor that I
don't have two of the same bills handy to compare them, but I suspect that
the bar codes only help identify the denomination (for vending machines
and the like) and not the serial number on the bill.  The serial number
would, however, be very easy to read by OCR...  after akk the numbers were
printed by a machine and should all be the same font, size, etc.
What are the odds that banking machines are actually tracking which bills
they give you.  If the banks then later checked out where the money was
coming from, they could do some very interesting demographics... and it
would be a great way to help catch bank machine criminals...
Anyway, I know I'm just being paranoid...  aren't I?

I have shied away from any "political" action against Clipper because I am
unsure how a Canadian can help...  I would like to think that the Canadian

@_subject: CryptoStacker, long term vision 
Hmmm...  I have a suggestion to make keeping the key in memory a little
more safe, though I don't think there is way to prevent a properly
resourced person/agency/enemy from getting it (or any other data in the RAM of
the computer).
You first need a machine which has a supervisor state, which *only* the OS
can run in.  Your cryptostacker will be part of the OS and as such, user
processes cannot access its memory.  This way, the attacking agency will
have difficulty just running any old program to copy all of the CPU's
memory to a disk.  The only way to add new programs to the supervisor
state (OS) would be if the machine is power up in a special way (with a
certian boot disk for example) so that once the machine is running there
is *no* software method to read any OS data.
You would also want to avoid storing the crypto key at a fixed memory
location.  Allocate some memory at a variable location at each startup and
store this location *only* in a register.  This should make it even more
difficult to get the key, because you would need to be able to check the
supervisor stack to find the right register to find the location of the key.
This raises the question of just how much work an agency goes through when
it is first confiscating a machine to ensure that they can get at all the
machines data.  If the first thing they do is turn the machine off to be
able to pack it up, then you are all set.  (Assuming you didn't manage to
turn it off before you lost control of the machine.)
What kinds of things can you do to your home machine to make more tamper
proof?  If you have an "easy access" case, how about installing a micro
switch that will reset the machine (or power cycle the system) when its

@_subject: CryptoStacker, long term vision 
This probably goes without saying, but just to make sure...
Since you are talking about using a partition, and partitions do not often
change in size (it implies a lot of backup and restore work to change a
partition size normally) then you could generate all the keys for all the
(known and fixed number of) tracks in advance.  The first thing the user
should do after generating all the keys is to make **many** backups,
perhaps all with different keys to encrypt the keys.  No one wants to lose
a whole partition because a floppy wore out and broke down!
The other interesting thing about encrypting per track... it exemplifies
the trade offs often associated with computing...  Usually they preach that
all files should be contiguous (all sectors on the same track if possible)
but for the most secure encryption of a file in this cryptostacker you
would want files to be on as many different tracks as possible.

I read this, and without knowing if anyone else has replied, it looks like
a need for an explanation of how to get more environment space in DOS.  Is
it that you don't know how to increase the DOS environment size, or does it
still not work even if you have increased it?  OBdisclaimer:  I don't know

@_subject: random access into an encrypted file? 
There are two possible ways to encrypt the file as they go to the disk,
and I think which you choose would determine what problems an fseek would
As I understand the conversation so far, the talk is to make the encrypted
disk software a device driver.  Imagine what a typical device driver must
do.  The operating system wishes to see all files as long strings
(streams) of bytes and the disk drive wishes to see all "files" as a
collection of sectors (of a fixed size).  The device driver converts a
request for file position 'x' to a request to locate sector 'y'.  Even if
you only want one byte from the file, a whole sector gets read in.
So heres where you have to decide which way you are going to encrypt the
file.  If you are going to encrypt each sector in isolation, then when the
operating system requests a certain file location, that maps to a certain
sector which is read in, decrypted (in isolation from the rest of the
sectors) and then a particular byte is readily available.
If however you use a different scheme whereby the whole file is encrypted
as a single entity (which would be difficult to impossible to do using the
device driver metaphor, but there are other ways to wedge encryption into
the system) then presumably you need to decrypt from the very beginning
any time you need to seek into the file, which is what I think you were
worried about.
If you are familiar with data compression products, then here is a
comparison of the two techniques:  If you use something like stacker,
which is implemented as a device driver, then you have access to any byte
of any file at any time.  If you use something like pklite (the .exe
compressor) then you can never seek into the file (to load an overlay for
example).  You have to read the whole file and decompress it in order
access the bytes individually as uncompressed data.
(That is not a perfect metaphor, as pklite files are self decompressing
when they execute, not when the operating system accesses them, but it
does serve to show the limitations imposed my higher level file management.)

@_subject: PGP question 
I am working on an interesting application using PGP.. and I have come
upon a snag.  I want to have a message with more that one "pgp block" ie
more than one file encrypted and then all the encrypted files concatenated
as one new file.  If you just use "pgp file" it tries to overwrite the same
file each time.  If you give it multiple -o specifications, it only takes
the last one, and tries to keep overwriting it.  If you use -p, it names
each file based on what the original encryptor called it, but in this
application that would allow for the files to still overwrite each other. What I really need is a way to specify a "base" that is modified for each
(eg  base="file" and output files become "file.1" "file.2" "file.3" etc)
Is this possible...  can anyone give me *any* suggestions to improve the
situation...  This has to be an unattended operation.

@_subject: REMAIL: problems 
I had another suggestion that might be helpful for people that are
chaining through many remailers, but it would require an addition or two
to existing remailers.
I'm not sure how to make clear what I mean, but lets start with a proposed
sample message:
   ::
   Request-Remailing-To-Remailer: hh at soda.berkeley.edu
   ::
   Request-Remailing-To-Remailer: remail at tamsun.tamu.edu
   ::
   Request-Remailing-To-Remailer: hfinney at shell.portal.com
   ::
   Request-Remailing-To: cypherpunks at toad.com
   {Message body goes here}
I'm sure you caught the change... You identify for the remailer when the
next hop is supposed to be a remailer.  Just by itself, this is of no
extra help, but hopefully of little extra bother because the old style
would still work.  Now how do we make it more reliable?
If the remailer knows that the message is going to another remailer, it
can expect a 'reply' from that remailer once the message has been
processed (forwarded), say within 48 hours.  Give each message a serial
number and the remailer a memory...  If the message is not acknowledged
within the timeout period, it skips a hop and goes to the next remailer
(or the destination).
This could also be expanded to let each remailer tell other remailers
about itself... it could maintain a database of known remailers.
The problem with this approach is that the remailer must store messages
locally for up 48 hours (well more if all of the hops were down)...  I
can't see (as Sameer alluded to) a way to have reliability (which sort of
implies, especially with the above approach, storage) and secrecy (which
implies quick and dirty 'less safe' message handling).
I have source code for serializing things (file access is what it was
designed form but I have found lots of neat uses for it).  It really quite
simple code, and not completely portable (well it uses flock(), not all
versions of un*x support flock()...)  I wrote the serializer to make sure
that my mail alias did not allow more than one copy of my email processing
script to run at once (thus creating very nasty log file collisions!).

@_subject: A anon remailer addressing suggestion 
I 'm way behind on my cypherpunks mail..  I just hope this hasn't been
recently discussed...
How about implimenting an anonymous remailer where the return address is
some sort of hash to the original id...  maybe based on time or count of
messages from that id, or something...  Thus, two messages sent from the
same person would have "differnt" return addresses...  and you would never
really keep an anonymous id...  it would be constantly changing...  but you
could always be reached, even at your "previous" addresses...  This would
beg for some sort of pseudonym option, in case you wanted a stream of your
messages to appear to come from the same person (granted with diff
addresses).  This could even be taken one step further, to include a small
portion of your original message in any replies... but thats probably  bit
too much...  :-)
crude example:
Am I just blowing hot air...  or is this a worthwhile idea?

{I realize I'm a mere two weeks behind in my mail...  please ignore me if
I'm way out of date on this...}
I agree that this is a great idea... and looking ahead into the mail I am
behind in, it looks like it is being done...  I'd also like to be able to
tell which mail list t he mail was from... I'd like it if the remailed
mail from the list had CYPH: prepended to the front of all the subjects...
On another note.... Tony... Please don't requote a large post, just to add
a one line reply...  It wastes a lot of bandwidth...  I hope that no
mailers still exist that do not allow you to edit the text that it
includes from an original message when doing a reply...  5 minutes of
editing for one person saves hundreds of people from wasting their time
skipping a redundant post...

@_subject: ADMIN:  allowable use 
I just putting this out to test the "temperature" of the cypherpunks
I am considering posting a questionaire that I would like each cypherpunk
to answer...  Its not written yet, thought I do have a good idea of what I
want to ask, and I suspect it would be a little lengthy (I can think of a
good 10 questions, each requiring a paragraph or two to answer).  My goal
of the questionaire would be to see what type of people use
cryptography... (Quite a simple goal...  but not easily met...)  I will of
course make the results available to the group, and optionally the raw
data (the person filling it out would have the option of not having any
"written" (more than a yes or no) answer "published").  Would the majority
consider this good use of cypherpunks bandwidth, or are you all too secretive?

@_subject: ADMIN: Handling of "tags" 
Just a suggestion about the implimentation of the "redistributer" program
that runs this list.
I noticed a goodly number of people are using "tags" like the "ADMIN:"
tag in my subject...  I think this is good.  I'd love to see it go one
step further, and have every cypherpunks message have a "CPUNK:" prepended
to the subject, so that I can read this more important mail first.  Also,
I notice that a lot of people reply to messages without editing the
subject, and the subject gets "mangled" to "Re: ADMIN: ..." instead of
"ADMIN: Re: ..."  Would it be possible to have the redistribution
software changed to do the first and correct the second?   Are these
changes worth it to anyone besides myself?

@_subject: A few different topics 
I have a couple of different things I want to talk about, so I'll make one
large post rather than several smaller ones.
I posted a link encryption post a while back, and one of the responses I
got back implied I was very naive in using a "shuffle" as part of the
initial manipulation of the packet to be sent.  I have spent some further
time thinking about this, and I still fail to see how reshuffling the order
of the data is anything but a good thing.
If the encryption algorithm generates one output character for each input
character, then I can see a situation developing where an "interloper"
could cause the message being sent to be changed:
   sender  --->  interloper  --->  receiver
                  ^
                  Knows senders password, but sender
                  is unaware.  Changes sent message
                  without senders knowledge.
Now this situation is a possibility any time a store and forward (such as
email) situation exists and someone (other than the sender and receiver as
appropriate) knows the password(s).  This could still be a problem in a
real time link, unless the data is sent in a nonlinear (shuffled) order. The implication is, that if the data has to be rearranged to be
understood, then the interloper is going to have to gather more than one
packet, and rearrange them to understand whats being sent, in order to be
able to know what changes to make to the message to make it have an altered
meaning for the receiver.  Collecting the packets would cause a delay that
would (should) be noticeable on a real time link.
I still don't like the idea of trying to use timing as the only control,
given the modern communications can be filled with arbitrary delays, but I
don't know of any other approach that will offer any hope of detecting
that someone knows your password.
This is probably another problem that would be solved by a "more powerful
mailer", but not having one on hand I do not know this to be the case:
I have a second thought about the subject handling of posts to this (and
other) email lists.  In my Bitnet days, I used to be on a number of
Listserv lists.  One of things I liked about them was that the messages
always showed up as being from the list.  The email I get now, all appears
to be a collection of private mail from a collection of individual people... The problem occurs when someone replys privately to one of my posts.  It is
impossible for me to tell which mail is sent directly to me, and which mail
has been redirected by the list.
I am about to start "spec"ing a software licensing system using public key
technology.  I would like any comments...  this is not something I have
seen discussed on the list in the short time I've been subscribed.  What I
propose is that the software would require (say in an environment
variable or a special file some where) an "activation key".  The
activation key would be some licensing data that was encrypted with a
private key by the software manufacturer (say a serial number, licensee's
name, and a license duration (or expiry date)).  The software would have
the public key compiled into it, and only if it could decode the
activation key, and it had not expired, would the software run.
The majority response on "should I try my survey" was positive (in fact I
only got one "count me out").  I was warned that it may end up meaningless
because everyone will submit anonymous responses...  I don't see where
that will be a problem, unless someone submits multiple responses or
unless hiding behind anonymity means someone still feels inclined to be
untruthful.  I guess maybe I'm just being foolish by assuming that
allowing anonymous posts would make people feel more secure in telling the
truth about themselves...  In any case, I will start collecting my
thoughts and form some questions...

It also gets (analog, I don't know if digital is available elsewhere, its

one of the towers instead...  This may be handy if you want to be
anonymous, and you have access to a cellular phone...  (And can afford the
prime time rates...  :-)  Its not my phone, I had a friend test it for me...

@_subject: Something just sunk in... 
I have been way behind in my email, and I've been catching up...  I was
just reading some of the Clipper mail (To be called the "Huge Clipper
Email Burst of 93"???? ;-) when something just sort of sunk in... Asumme for a minute that Clipper was enforced and it got to the point that it
was embedded in *every* phone...  What of the poor (this is sarcasm) law
enforcement agency that has to tap a family such as my own.  We have (at
last count) 6 phones on two lines.  Thats two lines to monitor for one of
6 different unit keys.  Are they going to get one court order for each
phone? or will the one court order do for all of the keys...  Am I
supposed to pay to replace all 6 phones??  I didn't see any mention of
having more than one chip with the same key (not that I would want that
anyway)...  Have they considered this?
