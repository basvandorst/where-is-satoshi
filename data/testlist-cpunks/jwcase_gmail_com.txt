I'm not an engineer, but unless your fiber can transmit a house in less
than one second, it may already be obsolete in light of this scientific
And you called them "junk."

Hey Al, You’ve got to have a pretty thick skin to be on a mailing list - sometimes people post several messages in a row that may be over your head,  in regards to people or events you have  no knowledge of, or just plain boring. In these cases it is best to just buddha-up - find your delete key and go with the flow. If you really can’t see why the members of this particular list might be interested this particular “celebrity’s” correspondence in this matter — if you truly have “no idea what it is about” — then perhaps you should save your comments until you do have some inkling of what’s going around you. Then you won’t appear petulant or uninformed when you wish to participate rationally at a later time. Good luck!

i am unable to access the slides, or any of the PDF files from cryptome’s front page using google’s chrome app for the iPad. chrome says that the site is behaving “strangely” and that i “cannot proceed” …. this is chrome’s red malware warning page, without an option to proceed at my own risk.

Lord Kelvin, died in 1907, before there were "accurate computer models" that could show anything at all. Certainly that makes this a meager and unsatisfactory quote. There is abundant research, of the scientifically valid kind, showing that the climate is changing, and indeed it would be strange if it were not. You are illustrating the op's point nicely, w/r/t politicized scientific bullshit.
