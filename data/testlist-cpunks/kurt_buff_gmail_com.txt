While I understand and share the sentiment, I'm beginning to wonder if
it might make sense to simply ask "why?", and keep asking that until
some straight answers emerge.
Because, as mothers everywhere ask "if some of your friends jumped off
a cliff, would that make it the right and smart thing to do, or merely
the popular and stupid thing?"

Certainly that's the current bias, but web  browser as platform isn't
really all that it's cracked up to be, IMHO - all browsers suck, and I
don't see them getting better any time soon, especially if they run
javascript and plugins.
Certainly better than public/commercial clouds - at least until proven
encryption becomes the norm.
Eh - good sysadmins with good managers/policies can secure Windows
just fine, though I do like jails under FreeBSD...

In which case, they should be able to justify, to me, why they're
jumping - I'm reasonably intelligent, and can usually follow along...

That's pretty easy. Fire up wireshark, look for packets heading to
google-owned addresses.
Kill off processes one by one until you see those packets stop.
You have found your culprit.

Bitlocker for Win7 requires the Enterprise or Ultimate editions, as
applicable. (
Bitlocker for Win8.1 requires the Pro or Enterprise edition
Bitlocker for Win10 requires the Pro, Enterprise or Education edition,
and it's unclear whether the Mobile, Mobile Enterprise or IoT Core
editions support it.
All versions Windows with editions less than Enterprise also don't
support Applocker, though Software Restriction Policies can be used,
even if they are not as easy to implement.
For those wanting always on connectivity to their own mothership
(businesses, mostly) will also require the Enterprise version of
Windows for DirectAccess. It's extremely handy for those who need it,
and can afford the infrastructure.

A mole in the home - nice.
And why should it be smart? AFAICT, "smart", anymore, WRT to all
thnngs consumer/IoT, means nothing more than "spies on you".
I don't care about that - I've got a 1080p projector and a bluray
player, and buy disks from the bin with cash. If and when 4k
projectors come down to a reasonable level I might (maybe) buy one of
those and a matching player.

Anarchism is hard for some people to differentiate from nihilism.
Try reading Lysander Spooner, Benjamin Tucker, Ludwig von Mises and,
most especially, Murray Rothbard. Maybe a bit of David Friedman, too.
Once you've made your way through their works, you can call yourself
educated in anarchism.
Ignore Emma Goldman, the various Russian anarchist, the
anarcho-syndicalists, etc. - they aren't serious.

Yes, I'm serious, including about von Mises. He's extraordinarily
influential, and Rothbard cites him as a primary influence. You must
grant him (as you must with other historical figures, especially those
of intellectual stature) the limitations of his time and place. See
especially He was not prepared to take the last few steps toward repudiating
government, but he laid the foundation for those who would.
Libertarians (both big and small 'L') usually postulate some form of
minimalist government - usually of the "night watchman" strain.
Nihilism (as opposed to both regular libertarianism and individualist
anarchism) seems to eschew both personal responsibility and the logic
of causality, preferring the dream state of absolute freedom, without

There's a difference between cowardice and understanding that
some/many/most actions in support of liberty are
[un|counter]productive. Plus, as we age, we accumulate obligations,
some of which (marriage and children especially) are vastly
inhibitory. This is not to say that action for freedom is worthless,
but it does mean that one must be judicious in choosing those actions
which will productive and worth the risk.
It's important to realize that not all actions which are morally
legitimate are reasonable. Take for instance the writings of Richard
Slomon, who advocated for a number of (in his philosophy) morally
legitimate actions (cf "retaliatory recapture"), but who didn't
actually undertake those actions, for various reasons.
Lastly, one should realize that your first obligation is to yourself,
then to your [chosen] family/friends, and finally none at all to
"society", which is a construct of dubious utility, and which doesn't
exist on its own. It's not a matter of "every man for himself and
devil take the hindmost", it's a matter of "there's only so much one
can do, and the most important things come first".

The characterization of Darwinism as egoism and pitiless struggle is
so odd as to be not even wrong, though it was popular.
Evolutionary theory (and Darwinism) is about differential
reproduction, not the Hobbesian war of all against all. It certainly
admits of, and has been demonstrated to use, cooperation.
