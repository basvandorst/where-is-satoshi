Tor Weekly News                                        October 2nd, 2013
Welcome to the fourteenth issue of Tor Weekly News, the weekly
newsletter that covers what’s happening in the much-discussed Tor
Tor Browser Bundle 3.0alpha4 released
Multiple users wrote to the help desk asking for guidance setting up
hidden service sites. The most straightforward documentation for hidden
services is in the torrc file itself [14]. A more in-depth guide can be
found on the Tor Project website [15]. The website also documents how
hidden services work [16]. Technical details can be found in the
Rendezvous Specification document [17].

Mike Perry published his new GPG public key, adding: “this new key will
be used to sign email from me going forward, and will be used to sign
software releases until such time as I get around to creating a second
set of keys on a hardware token for that purpose” [23].
  [23] David Fifield updated the Pluggable Transports bundles using the latest
Tor Browser Bundle [24]. In order to benefit from the improvements and
security fixes, please update!
  [24] intrigeri sent a release schedule for Tails 0.21 [25]. The first release
candidate should be out on October 20th.
  [25] Roger Dingledine sent out “a list of criteria to consider when
evaluating pluggable transports for readiness of deployment to users”,
asking for comments on his initial draft [26].
  [26] If you have the necessary hardware and want to help Tails out, please
test two upcoming features: persistent printer settings [27] and support
for more SD card readers (the “sdio” type) [28].

References: The Tor Project responds:
You might reply 'well, they would say that, wouldn't they', but I think
the Tor community has long assumed that the authorities have something
like what Andrew Lewman describes and would be shocked if they didn't.
Also, this guarantees nothing, but Edward Snowden, who presumably knows
exactly what that QUICK ANT tab does, still has enough confidence in Tor
to have the logo stuck on his laptop lid.

Tor Weekly News                                      September 3rd, 2014
Welcome to the thirty-fifth issue of Tor Weekly News in 2014, the weekly
newsletter that covers what is happening in the Tor community.
Tor Browser 3.6.5 and 4.0-alpha-2 are out
The Tails team released [5] version 1.1.1 of the Debian- and Tor-based
live operating system. As well as upgrading key components like Tor,
Iceweasel, and Linux, this release disables I2P by default when Tails is
booted, in response to the vulnerability recently disclosed by Exodus
Intelligence [6]. Like Truecrypt, “i2p” must now be specified as a
parameter on booting by users who wish to use it.
A number of other security fixes and routine improvements make this an
important update for all Tails users. See the full changelog in the
team’s announcement, then update from a running copy of Tails 1.1 if you
have one, or head to the download page [7] if you don’t.
  [5]:   [6]:   [7]: Helping Internet services accept anonymous users
Yawning Angel released [26] a new set of experimental Tor Browser builds
containing the proposed obfs4 pluggable transport, along with a
changelog; “questions, comments, feedback” are welcome on the email
thread or the bug ticket tracking the deployment of obfs4 [27].
 [26]:  [27]: Arturo Filastò announced [28] the release of version 1.1.0 of
oonibackend, the tool “used by ooniprobe to discover the addresses of
test helpers (via the bouncer) to submit reports to (via the collector)
and to perform some measurements that require a backend system to talk
to (via test helpers)” [29].
 [28]:  [29]: meejah posted [30] a list of tasks to be completed in order to bring Tor
Weather to a deployable state, following the recent rewrite effort and
the Google Summer of Code project by Sreenatha Bhatlapenumarthi.
 [30]: Israel Leiva submitted a summary [31] of work completed as part of the
“Revamp GetTor” Google Summer of Code project: “The plan for now is to
keep doing tests and deploy it asap (hopefully during September).”
 [31]: Mike Perry posted [32] an updated version [33] of the proposal for
website fingerprinting countermeasures which he co-authored with Marc
Juarez as part of the latter’s Google Summer of Code project.
 [32]:  [33]: Lunar gave a talk [34] at this year’s DebConf on the effort to build
Debian packages deterministically, which is inspired in large part by
Tor Browser’s use of the same technology [35]. Major progress was
achieved during the conference [36].
 [34]:  [35]:  [36]: David Fifield submitted a breakdown [37] of the costs incurred by the
infrastructure that supports the meek pluggable transport [38] since its
introduction. The total to date from both the Google App Engine and
Amazon AWS front domains? $6.56.
 [37]:  [38]: Thanks to P D [39] and Daniel Pajonzeck [40] for running mirrors of the
Tor Project website and software!
 [39]:  [40]: Also on the subject of mirrors, Roger Dingledine alerted [41] the
tor-mirrors mailing list to the fact that the Tor Project website
(specifically the distribution directory) will shortly be increasing in
size to eight or nine gigabytes, as a result of the
soon-to-be-implemented Tor Browser updater [42]. Mirror operators will
need to ensure that they can provide enough disk space to accommodate
the change.
 [41]:  [42]: whonixqubes announced [43] the release of an integrated version of the
Whonix and Qubes operating systems: “I look forward to helping make
Qubes + Whonix integration even tighter and more seamless throughout the
 [43]: Tor help desk roundup
Anony Mouse wanted to know why Facebook shows the location of the user’s
last login over Tor as Baghdad or Dhaka [45], instead of the real
location of the exit relay. qbi posted a screenshot showing this
issue [46]. According to Facebook, this information is based on an
approximation, but this approximation locates all Tor exit relays either in Baghdad or in Dhaka.
 [45]:  [46]: user3500 wants to contribute to Tor and asks how this can be done as an
inexperienced developer [47]. Jens Kubieziel replied with several
possibilities, including reading the volunteer page and Tor Weekly News:
in particular, the section containing easy development tasks might be a
good start. Roya pointed out that any contribution is better than no
contribution, and encouraged user3500 to just get started. Umut Seven
recommended writing unit tests.
 [47]: Kras wants to use FoxyProxy in connection with Tor Browser Bundle and
asks if it is safe to do so [48]. At the moment, there is only an answer
saying “yes”, without any explanation. What is your experience? Is it
safe for a user to install and use FoxyProxy?
