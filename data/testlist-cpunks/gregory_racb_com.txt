Hi, Uwe
I am glad you are reading my letter. I decided to send you a
mail and invite you to build relationships with me. I am a woman who
wants to create a loving family, have children, live in love and
happiness. I will give all my tenderness I have in my heart to the man
who will be my husband. Do you want to build relationships with me?
Waiting for your reply
