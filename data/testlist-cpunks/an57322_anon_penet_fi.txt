It is interesting to read all the recent posts about Oceania, because it is
of course the story of Sealand, an independent country that was founded in
the Seventies. It would be wise if the promoters and future citizens of
Oceania studied the failure of Sealand before putting another dime into
their  doomed project.
Shortly after Sealand was funded on a large surplus housing platform in the
oil fields of the North sea, Sealand began issuing its own currency,
passports, and stamps. The results were predictable: nobody wanted their
money, no other country accepted their passports for entry, and the
international postal organization refused to deliver their mail. IMHO,
there can be little doubt that Oceania would suffer the same fate-if the
project ever gets a far as having a platform.
The nations of the world are like a very exclusive country club: no new
members accepted. Occasionally, a former member gets readmitted, or one
member dies and her two children take her place, but there will be no

Yes, read that note again. Who cares about 42,000 right-wing extremists in
a country in which the government is so fascist to make it illegal for
someone to tell you how to start your own paper? And just in case you were
wondering: Germany is considered a democratic country. Now you know where
the US under Clinton is heading.

@_subject: Clarification RE: Nazis on the Net 
Sorry for being unclear. This is what I was trying to say:
I am an anarchist and don't like Nazis. However, I believe that everyone
should have the right to say what they believe needs to be said. By making
it illegal to let certain parts of society know how to start a newspaper
(assuming this is true), the German government employs the very same
principles it is trying to fight. Furthermore, I believe that a government
in power that use fascist methods (such as taking away one's right to
publsh a paper) is more dangerous to society as a whole than some juvenile
hotheads, whose crazy ideas probably would be rather discredited than being
help by putting out for everyone to read.
As for the analogy to the US: I see the constant increase in attempts to
censor the media as a warning that perhaps some day soon it may be illegal
to tell someone in the US how to go about publishing your own paper.

That may be true, but the benign autocrat of today will all too soon be
replaced by a not-at-all-so-benign fascist, who then has the power to keep
critical post of the net "for the common good".
Just say NO to Usenet moderation.

Routine implants of transponder devices into humans are not a question of
if, but only of when. I predict that they will become routine before the
end of the decade. First they will be voluntary, used primarily  in
children to facilitate identification in case of abduction, some years
later they will become mandatory for all drivers, to combat the use of fake
driver licenses, and soon thereafter transponders will become the primary,
if not sole accepted form of ID for all business transactions. A generation
from now transponders will be mandatory used not only for identification,
but for routine tracking of the movements of every citizen. If you think
this sounds crazy, go to Germany, where you will find a camera on every
major intersection, tracking your every move.
