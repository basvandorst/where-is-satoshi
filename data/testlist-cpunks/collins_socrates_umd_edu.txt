@_subject: Cypher: Subject naming proposal 
Can I suggest that any messages posted to cypherpunks start with "Cypher:"
in the subject line? The mail from this list is getting mixed in with all
my other mail, cause my newsreader (elm) can't sort on "To:" fields.

@_subject: Cypher:Subject naming- SUMMARY 
Ok, here's a summary of replies regarding sorting of mail by To: fields,
or more in general, grouping all list mail together by mailing list.
Thanx to all who responded. As you can see, there are a variety of ways
to approach this problem.
All of these replys were posted to Cypherpunks already, so re-posting
is kosher.
I've cut out the extra header stuff and the PGP signatures, and edited
the messages for brevity.
     I use the following .forward file to make slocal "sort" my mail based
upon the contents of the .maildelivery file below.
