  WASHINGTON -AP- Negotiators resolved a dispute over media ownership,
removing the last major hurdle to an overhaul of laws governing the nation's
communications industry.     Once approved by Congress, the White House pledged to sign the legislation
into law.     ''This is an extremely positive development for the U.S. economy, for
individuals and for consumers alike,'' Vice President Al Gore said during
an interview in his office.     President Clinton, who had threatened to veto earlier provisions of
the measure, will sign what Gore called ''a centrist bill for the 21st
century.''
