        There is a company called Optoelectronics that markets a radio reciever          called the Interceptor.  This is a broad band (several hundred MHz)          device designed to lock on to the most powerful signal around,
         regardless of frequency.  As supplied, it only has a rubber duck          antenna, but a broadband, directional antenna (Log Periodic?) could be          attached.  There are AM and FM versions that output audio and a version
         called the Scout that controls a scanner.  These could have outboard          devices hung on to them to decode digital signals, record the          conversation ... all for less than $1000.

The demo of the Interceptor I saw seemed to show it jumping from 150 MHz to 450 MHz without any external adjustments, it locked on the strongest signal.
Granted, it can only receive one frequency at a time, but there shouldn't be any
significant delays when the phone hops a frequency.  The Interceptor's frequency readout is a bargraph style LED.  The Scout, from what I can
see in Optoelectronics' ad doesn't have any frequency controls on it, it does
have a digital frequency readout.  As far as timing is concerned, the Scout might be less useful because I think it feeds the frequency into the scanner for
reception.  Most scanners take a significant amount of time to change
Merry Christmas

@_subject: 900 MHz phones 
It seems like the hornets nest has been stirred.  I was merely trying to point out a possible consumer grade hole in
some of the FH phones currently on the market.  If the Interceptor or Scout can
be used to listen to a FH phone, then surely it is being done.
I used to work with a guy who would program his scanner to all of his
neighbors cordless phone frequencies, then he would call them to
verify his programming.  A six-pack on a Saturday night and the scanner would
be more entertaining than the bug light.  Personally, my concern is with my next door neighbor listening to me talk to my
girlfriend, not the NSA.  If I want to arrange delivery of PGP to the Russians of where I should pick up my next 50 kg of cocaine, I'm *not* going to use my
home phone.  Because of these concerns, I refuse to own a cordless phone.  So    if the 900 MHz phones are resistant to these consumer grade attacks, they might
be worth the money, otherwise the neighbors will just upgrade.
