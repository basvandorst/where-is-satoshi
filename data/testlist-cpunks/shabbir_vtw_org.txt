@_subject: CDT Policy Post 2.28 - FBI Director to Testify at Senate Crypto Hearing 
I would disagree with you here jim.  Perhaps you have a selective memory,
but representatives from all the organizations attended the Clipper II
hearings at NIST in Maryland and gave the pro-GAK folks a good drubbing.
(with NIST's microphone too.  They're such good sports...)
Person after person got up at the first of those (and subsequent ones) and
grilled representatives from the FBI, NSA, NIST, and the White House.
The ACLU, EPIC, EFF, CDT, and VTW were all there and pitched in.  Somehow
I don't think that getting grilled is what's missing.  The thing that's holding us back here is that we're all pretty sold on
our arguments.  When the White House comes to their senses, or Congress
overrules them, or the market makes them irrelevant, then we'll have some

THE LATEST NEWS
In the opening round of what promises to be a no-holds-barred fight
with the Clinton Administration and the Intelligence community over
cryptography policy, Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and Representative
Robert Goodlatte (R-VA) presented bills today that intend to:
 	 available software such as Phil Zimmerman's "Pretty Good Privacy"
The topic of cryptography exports is crucial to the continued growth
and security of the Internet and online commerce.  The success of the
information economy in many cases hinges on the ability to employ
strong encryption techniques to protect confidential data.
The two bills come at a crucial time after the Clinton Administration
has put forth two flawed encryption proposals, Clipper and Son of
Clipper.  A third plan, this time in the form of legislation, is in the
works if one is to believe the rumors in the press.  So far the only
reason the Clinton Administration's flawed "Clipper" plans have been
paid any attention to at all is because they offer relaxed export
controls in return for storing your keys with government agencies or
quasi-government agencies.  The best part of the Leahy bill, though, is
that you can use the encryption export provisions without ever thinking
about using escrow.
Leahy's bill will ensure that few consumers, if any, ever consider another
Clinton-mandated encryption scheme ever again.
The Leahy/Goodlatte bill allows the export of most of the cryptographic
products you and I would would like to use, without any of the Clipper
requirements.  Without the lure of relaxed export for "Clippered"
products, nobody will pay attention to Clipper products.  This will
surely be the deadly blow to all present and future "Clipper" plans
that rely on the Clinton Administration's strongarm export policy
A new Clinton proposal on encryption is rumored to be in the works.
However, judging from the way they've bungled the first two proposals,
VTW believes the newest Clinton proposal will be created with a similar
process, with little regard for the concerns of business, industry and
the public.
One thing is certain; there will be movement on encryption policy this
year.  It may be legislative or it may be regulatory; we're in a far
better position driving legislation we endorse, rather than lobbing
bombs at legislation being driven past us.
VTW believes this legislation is an excellent initiative.  We have long
advocated the decontrol of cryptography export laws based on the
following principles:
 	 from.
The way Leahy/Goodlatte addresses export of cryptography is consistent
with our principles. VTW will keep you informed of its progress.  As
anyone familiar with the legislative process knows, a bill rarely ever
looks the same at the end of the process as it did at the beginning.
This bill is good for the Internet, and we intend to monitor it like
the watchdogs you expect us to be, to ensure that it does not
significantly deviate from the basic principles outlined above.
In doing this, it will be crucial for the Internet community to speak
up.  Big business will weigh in on this bill to protect their rights to
sell products with encryption in them.  However nobody will speak up
for your right to have a private conversation except you.
We're counting on you to find that voice, and use it over the next few
months to ensure that your present right to use encryption *of your
choice* isn't amended out of the bill.  There are some powerful forces
out there that will be lobbying heavily on this legislation.  The White
house is rumored to have their bill ready.  The law enforcement and
intelligence communities, who would rather you couldn't use strong
encryption, will be employing their usual scare tactics.  Worst of all,
the Clinton Administration, particularly Vice President Al Gore, who
should be a voice of reason for these issues, will, if the example of
Clipper and Son of Clipper is any indication, pander to law enforcement
and the anti-crime vote in an election year.
We predict that the White House will do everything in their power to
prevent Senator Leahy from liberating PGP.  He will need your help to
push forward.
Over the next few months, VTW will be coordinating a coalition of
names, many of which are already familiar to you.  This coalition will
ask you to call and write to Congress, expressing your opinion, and
threatening to back it up with the ultimate legitimate weapon of
democracy, your vote in this election year.
We're counting on you; we know you're up to it.
We urge you to visit our homepage at  where we'll
keep you updated on current events involving the bill.  If you haven't

ANALYSIS OF ENCRYPTED COMMUNICATIONS PRIVACY ACT
The Leahy and Goodlatte bills are not exactly alike.  For the moment,
we will concentrate on the Leahy bill for purposes of analysis.  We
find it to be fleshed out in many areas.
AFFIRMS OUR RIGHT TO USE CRYPTOGRAPHY OF OWN CHOOSING
The bill affirms that "Americans should be free lawfully to use
whatever particular encryption techniques, technologies, programs, or
products developed in the marketplace they desire in order to interact
electronically worldwide in a secure, private, and confidential
manner".  The bill also affirms our right to use cryptographic products
that do not have key escrow functions in them, or to choose not to use
such functions.  If we do choose to use escrow holders, the bill
affirms our right to use key holders of our own choosing.
DEREGULATION OF PUBLICLY-AVAILABLE CRYPTOGRAPHIC TECHNOLOGY
The bill addresses the "PGP problem" by making software that is
"generally available", "publicly available", or "public domain"
exportable with NO LICENSE REQUIRED, unless it is "specifically
designed for military use".
CREATES CRIMINAL PENALTIES FOR MALICIOUS KEY HOLDERS
If I designate a local business to be my key holder, it is important
that they take that responsibility seriously.  The bill creates
criminal penalties for key holders that behave recklessly with my
decryption keys.
Recently the Administration suggested that such individuals must be
licensed by the US Government, and in some cases, be required to
possess security clearances.  This would make them little more than
puppets of law enforcement.  The bill creates criminal penalties with
monetary fines if a key holder releases a key recklessly or
inappropriately. Reasonable rules for an escrow agents conduct are
described in the bill. These are discussed further below.
RAISES THE STANDARD FOR A COURT TO OBTAIN YOUR DECRYPTION KEY
Currently a court needs to only issue a simple search warrant to obtain
a copy of your key for decryption of your communications.  This bill
raises the requirement to be equivalent to that of a court-ordered
ENCOURAGES KEY HOLDERS TO SERVE THE INTERESTS OF KEY OWNERS WHEN
 PRESENTED WITH A COURT-ORDER
If you have chosen to use a key holder, they may find themselves in a
curious predicament if presented with a court order at some point in
the future.  They really don't want to simply hand over your decryption
key, since once it is divulged, it might be used to decrypt more
information than what is required under the court order.
The bill instructs a key holder to provide law enforcement with as
little information as possible, in order to satisfy a warrant request,
while still protecting as much of the key owner's confidentiality as
The bill accomplishes this by instructing a key owner to attempt to
deliver decrypted communications only for the times specified by the
warrant to law enforcement as a first step.  If the key holder is
unable to produce the decrypted communication for law enforcement, only
then, as a last resort, should a key holder relinquish your key.
This allows a key holder to work to protect the confidentiality of your
decryption keys, while still fulfilling both the spirit and letter of
the court order.
DISCOURAGES THE USE OF ENCRYPTION TO THWART A FELONY INVESTIGATION
This is probably the one provision we wouldn't have put in the bill,
were we drafting it.  Clearly added to appease law enforcement, it
creates a new crime to "willfully" attempt to thwart a law enforcement
investigation by using encryption.  VTW feels that such a crime is
unnecessary, but we're happy to see this is a fairly narrowly-tailored
statute.  It only applies to individuals who are engaging in a felony
and using encryption to communicate information while in the commission
of the felony, and whose intent, in using encryption, is to foil a law
enforcement investigation.
If you and a friend are talking with an encrypted phone, and you
mention that you think some mutual friend is cheating on their taxes,
you are not liable under this provision.  If you are planning the
Million Man March using encrypted email, and fear that you may be
investigated because your cause in unpopular in some law enforcement
circles, you are not liable because you are not committing a felony,
even though law enforcement may find it annoying that they cannot read
your mail.
This provision only applies to you if you are using encryption to
specifically foil a law enforcement investigation AND the communication
relates to a felony AND you are using the communication to commit the
felony.  VTW feels this is a fairly narrowly drawn statute that is not
likely to be easily abused.
Although this bill is the best thing we've seen in Congress on this
issue since ex-Rep. Maria Cantwell's (D-WA) export-of-encryption bill
was introduced to the 103rd Congress two years ago, there are still
some issues in the bill that bear further examination.  Let it be
understood that we think the balance of this bill right now will help
the net far more than hurt it and the net should step forward and help
Leahy and Goodlatte in their fight against the Administration over this
issue.  Nevertheless, our suggestions for tuning this bill are included
BILL SHOULD INCLUDE AN EXPLICIT SUPPRESSION PROVISION
Although the Fourth Amendment is the law of the land, it is important
to note that it a applies to communications decrypted after an
erroneous warrant has been issued.  VTW feels that such a provision
should be enumerated in the bill, just to clarify any concerns a court
might have about such evidence.  It is also clear, however, that such a
provision is nearly impossible to obtain in the current Congressional
climate, though we will continue to urge the bill's sponsors to add
THE BILL SHOULD CLEARLY INCLUDE ENCRYPTION PRODUCTS FOR STORED DATA
The bill addresses encryptions products used for wire or oral
communications, per the Electronic Communications Privacy Act.  Since
many encryption products are built for just this purpose, it includes
many of them.  However, we think it is appropriate to specifically
include products that are used only for encrypting stored data.
THE BILL SHOULD INSTRUCT ESCROW AGENTS TO REPORT DISCLOSURES AS WELL
The bill currently requires law enforcement to notify the Office of the
Courts as to the number of court orders served on key holders and for
what crimes the court orders were obtained.  The Office is required to
make this information public annually.
VTW feels that accountability should never be in short supply.
Requiring key holders to notify the Office of the Courts whenever they
are ordered to disclose a key will allow the public yet another way of
making sure that appropriate procedures are being followed to protect
the public.
We suggest an inexpensive reporting method such as registered mail so
as not to burden key holders needlessly.  Presumably, when the Office
of the Courts totals up its numbers every year, the number of
disclosures reported by law enforcement will add up to the SAME number
reported by key holders themselves.  Should there be a discrepancy, the
public will be grateful for the additional accountability.
NEW CRIMES ARE NEEDED TO DISCOURAGE MISREPRESENTING YOURSELF TO A KEY HOLDER
Currently the bill relies on existing laws that cover police
misrepresentation to punish law enforcement officials that misrepresent
themselves to a key holder with an improper or forged warrant to obtain
a key or a decrypted communication.
The majority of law enforcement officials are good people that would
never consider such an act.  Consequently, they should have nothing to
fear from such a statute.
VTW believes that a new statute is needed to dissuade those few
over-zealous law enforcement officials from violating the public's
trust in these matters.
On the whole, we believe that this bill is a win for the Internet
public and Internet businesses that require strong market-driven
cryptography.  VTW urges you to become familiar with it and support
Leahy and Goodlatte in their efforts.

CHRONOLOGY OF THE 1996 LEAHY/GOODLATTE CRYPTO BILLS
Feb 26, '96	Sen. Leahy (D-VT) and Rep. Goodlatte (R-VA) introduce
A FEW QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Q: Does this require, or even urge individuals to use third parties to
   hold their decryption keys?
A: No way.  You can use the liberal export provisions in this bill with
   out ever allowing your keys to leave your "cold dead fingers".
Q: Does this advance the Clinton Administration's Clipper scheme in any way?
A: No, in fact this bill cuts out the very heart of the Clipper program.
   The two Clipper programs had the potential to be adopted because Clipper
   products were intended to receive preferential export treatment.  This
   allows the export of non-Clipper products.  In the global marketplace,
   the Clipper products will not be able to compete.  This bill is probably
   the final nail in the coffin of the Administration's flawed Clipper
   proposals.
Q: Bills change during Congressional deliberation. Could this bill
   change in such a way that VTW would no longer support it?
A: Absolutely. In fact, we consider it our mission to monitor the
   legislation to ensure that it isn't amended to act against the right
   of Internet users and businesses.
Q: Wasn't Goodlatte one of the bad guys on the Communications Decency Act?
   Why is he sponsoring this bill, and can we trust him?
A: Goodlatte did indeed introduce the fatal amendment that made the House
   version of the Telecomm Bill unsupportable. Nevertheless, VTW has found
   that a Congressperson's vote on one sort of bill is little indication of
   his or her stand on others. VTW wil closely examine any change in the
   language of the bill throughout its Congressional life.
Q: Does this create a requirement for key holders to exist, or for me to
   use programs that store keys with third parties?
A: No.  The bill affirms your right to use encryption without such a feature,
   and if you do use software with such a feature, to self-escrow the keys.
   In fact, key holders can exist today.
Q: Does this create a new obligations for key holders to disclose keys that
   they wouldn't have to comply with before?
A: No. In fact, this bill makes it harder for a law enforcement official to
   retrieve a key from a key holder, by requiring a wiretap request instead
   of a simple search warrant.

This is a pretty good improvement in the situation, and will hopefully
pave the way for the "whole enchilada".  It's not good strategy though
to criticize this because it's not the ultimate crypto bill.  Let's be
honest with ourselves here, this is Congress we're talking about and
this is a pretty bold step.  We need to educate them to see the facts
we understand so thoroughly: that crypto export controls do not work,
endanger our own requirements for confidentiality, and aren't helping
contain this technology in the rest of the world.
Forcing Congress to have this debate will lay bare these facts and
hopefully embarass the Administration for their absurd policy
approach on encryption.
They say that liberty is seldom lost all at once, but a little at a time. Regaining it is probably done this way as well.  In this case, the
Leahy bill gives us back a mouthful.

I read Tim's comments with enthusiasm, as I think we agree on many things.  I, as well, wish for a world where there is crypto so
heavily proliferated that all the regulations in the world cannot
either hinder or help get it into the hands of the public.
In the meantime, Tim advocates putting good code out there for people
to use, racing to the point of no return.  I don't disagree, but that's
not where my talents lie.  Mine lies in keeping Congress from doing damage
today, a strategy which Tim may call very short term (getting good code
out and well-deployed is long term) but hey, it's what we do.
Let's hope we both arrive at that end in time to retrospect about
strategy.  I must agree though, watching legislation is a lot like
watching sausage being made...

@_subject: So, what crypto legislation (if any) is necessary? 
I think this is a very important area to consider, and I thank Tim for
putting his thoughts into this very organized form.  My replies:
Unfortunately, this is not an option.  Legislation will happen, with our
endorsement or without it.  One good example is the Grassley computer
crime bill earlier in 1995.  Nobody advised him on this, as far as I can
tell, he just went out and drafted it.  Lo and behold, he drafted a
provision that basically criminalized all crypto, including rot13.
We have to wake up and learn from the fight against the net censorship
legislation.  This is realpolitik.  Congress will legislate crypto,
whether we want them to or not.  This is not news anyone wants to hear,
but we have to face up to it.
Congress has discovered the net, and partly though the widespread fame
of this list, they have also discovered crypto.  Simply saying, "we don't
want any laws that address crypto" may be the ideal solution, but that won't
stop them from passing laws that govern the domestic use of crypto.
Unfortunately, many U.S. software companies don't agree with you.
While I agree with you (I've got PGP, what's the problem?), several of
these companies are working through their trade organizations to introduce
and push crypto legislation to allow them to raise the key length in their
Put ourselves in their shoes for a minute.  They're sitting there, with
their 40 bit products, knowing that it blows chunks.  They want to
produce stronger crypto, but know they won't be able to export it.
They talk to the company's attorneys, who speak to speak to the
lobbyists, and poof, a crypto bill.
This is actually very important.  The Leahy bill forces Joe's Key
Warehouse to only divulge your key when they've been presented with a
warrant that's on par with whatever they used to get your original
communication.  That means that Louis Freeh can't issue an
administrative subpoena to get your key, after he's got a judge to
allow the FBI to search your house.  They have to get a judge involved
for both parts.
It's better than where we are today, where Joe's Key Warehouse is vulnerable
to every law enforcement joker that can write an administrative subpoena.  We
haven't yet had an incident that demonstrates this, but we will.
Of course, if you're the sort of person who thinks that the FBI and the
Department of Justice are involved in a big criminal conspiracy to begin
with, we shouldn't even be talking about due process, as you don't believe
it exists...
I think this indeed is what Leahy was aiming for.  A quick glance at the
bill will prove this out.  The approach that "things are fine as they are"
is like saying "I'm on a freight train, heading for a cliff, but they're
still serving me caviar so it's OK".
Sure, it feels ok, but the train's still moving, no matter how far you are
into your denial. I can't say this enough: the net has moved into realpolitik.  Congress
has found us, and their first step is to regulate us.  Then, they'll outlaw
us.  Let's hope we convert enough legislators to netizens before they outlaw

When everyone in the world seems to disagree with you, isn't it a good

Your misunderstanding of how interceptions are done is dangerous to
what is otherwise a rational, intelligent argument.  Indeed, there are ways to conduct a wiretap without a judge.  They require
dispensations from people like the Attorney General, for example.  And
this is certainly not a normal practice.

THE LATEST NEWS
Today, a core contingent of the US Senate proposed legislation that
would free public domain software such as Phil Zimmerman's PGP (Pretty
Good Privacy), allow for the export of products that have competitive
encryption abroad, and limit the government's ability to propose
another Clipper-style standard.
The latest proposal, sponsored by Sen. Burns (R-MT) is the third in a series
of bills this year that blatantly attack the Clinton Administration's
policies of restricting the export of encryption that is already found
outside the United States.  Text of the legislation is now available on
 and  as soon as we get it.
In another bold move, Senators Conrad Burns (R-MT) and Patrick Leahy (D-VT)
have scheduled online chats to discuss this legislation with the people
who understand the issue the best: the net community.  As a part of
the Whistlestop96 campaign by VTW and CDT (Center for Democracy and
Technology) to bring members of Congress in touch with the net community during the 1996 campaigns, Senators Burns and Leahy will be attending
live online chat sessions on HotWired and America Online.  The schedule

BI-PARTISAN SENATORS INTRODUCE NEW CRYPTO BILL
                  S.1726 PROMISES TO FREE ENCRYPTION FROM
                     COLD WAR REGULATORY STRANGLEHOLD
      Please widely redistribute this document with this banner intact
THE LATEST NEWS
In an effort to improve privacy and security on the Internet, a bi-partisan
group of legislators recently introduced a bill to encourage the widespread
availability of strong, easy-to-use encryption technologies.  The bill,
known as the Promotion of Commerce Online in the Digital Era (Pro-CODE) act
of 1996 (S. 1726), would relax Cold War era export controls which have
constrained the development and use of strong privacy and security technologies.
Encryption is one of the technologies that will allow us to visualize a secure
Internet, an Internet useful for conducting all sorts of private business
from communicating with one's doctor, loved one, or spouse, to checking
one's bank balance.
S.1726 is sponsored by Senators Burns (R-MT), Leahy (D-VT), Pressler (R-SD),
Wyden (D-OR), Ashcroft (R-MO), Dole (R-KS), Faircloth (R-NC), McCain (R-AZ),
and Murray (D-WA).
The Pro-CODE Act resolves to:
1.  Allow for the *unrestricted* export of "mass-market" or "public-domain"
    encryption programs, including such products as Pretty  Good Privacy and
    popular World Wide Web browsers.
2.  Requires the Secretary of Commerce to allow the less restricted export
    of other encryption technologies if products of similar strength are
    generally available outside the United States, roughly up to DES
    strength.
3.  Prohibits the federal government from imposing mandatory key-escrow
    encryption policies on the domestic market and limiting the authority
    of the Secretary of Commerce to set standards for encryption products. A copy of the legislation can be found at each of the WWW sites listed at
the bottom in the "For More Information" Section.
WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW
As more and more people come online, the need for - and lack of -
strong privacy and security is becoming increasingly critical.  This
legislation represents an important step towards ensuring that the
Internet develops into a secure, trusted medium for political,
commercial, and private speech.
The co-sponsors of S. 1726 have taken a political risk and are challenging
the White House, the NSA (National Security Agency, and the FBI (Federal
Bureau of Investigation) in a policy battle to protect your privacy. They
need your support.
Please familiarize yourself with the bill (pointers to background
information are listed below), and then take a moment to call, write, or

CRYPTO FACTOID
According to a 1993 study of encryption products worldwide, there are
193 products in 18 countries overseas that are sold with DES-strength
encryption built into them.
American companies and American programmers are today restricted from
selling products with DES-strength encryption to the overseas market,
or even distributing them domestically on the Internet.
It is becoming extremely difficult for American companies to compete
in the global market against competitors who do not labor under such

SENATE COMMERCE COMMITTEE SCHEDULED TO VOTE ON PRO-PRIVACY
       ENCRYPTION LEGISLATION (S.1726) ON THU SEPTEMBER 12, 1996
          CALL THE COMMERCE COMMITTEE (PHONE NUMBERS BELOW)
      Please widely redistribute this document with this banner intact
THE LATEST NEWS
On Thursday September 12, the Senate Commerce Committee is set to vote
on legislation designed to enhance privacy and security on the Internet.
The bill, known as the "Promotion of Commerce Online in the Digital Era
(Pro-CODE) Act," (S. 1726) is the best hope yet for real reform of U.S.
encryption policy, and its passage by the Commerce Committee would signify
a critical step forward in the struggle for privacy and security in the
Information Age.
The bill faces significant opposition from the Clinton Administration,
who continues to cling to a cold-war era view of U.S. encryption policy.
IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THE COMMERCE COMMITTEE HEAR FROM SUPPORTERS OF PRIVACY
AND SECURITY ON THE INTERNET. Please take a moment to contact the committee
by following the simple instructions below.
WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW
It's crucial that you call the Commerce committee members below and
urge them to pass S.1726 out of committee without amendments.  (This is
also known as a "clean" bill.)  Any opportunity for amendments (even if
they are good) opens us up to the possibility of hostile amendments
that could restrict the use of encryption even further than today's
abysmal state.  It could even prohibit the use of encryption without
Clipper Chip-like key 'escrow' technology, which includes built-in
surveillance and monitoring functionality.
1. Call/Fax the members of the Senate Commerce committee and urge
   them to pass S.1726 out of committee "cleanly".  Do not use email,
   as it is not likely to be looked at in time to make a difference
   for the markup on September 12th.
   Use the sample communique and directory listing below to make it a
   simple TWO MINUTE task.
2. Sign the petition to support strong encryption at
      !  Join other cyber-heroes as
   Phil Zimmermann, Matt Blaze, Bruce Schneier, Vince Cate, Phil Karn, and
   others who have also signed.
3. Between now and Wed. September 12, it is crucial that you call all
   these members of Congress.

BACKGROUND / WHAT TO EXPECT THIS WEEK
For the past 3 years, Cyber-Rights Activists, citizens, and industry
leaders have been working hard to reform US encryption policy.
Support has been building behind several legislative proposals this
year because they send a clear signal to the Administration about the
need for security and privacy in the Information Age.  The digital
revolution is currently being held hostage by the White House's Cold
War restrictions on privacy-enhancing encryption technology.
Now, with Congress less than a month away from adjournment, everyone
who supports encryption and privacy is working to see this bill leave
committee in order to send a clear message to the White House that they
are on the wrong side of the encryption issue.  Although this bill may
not become law this year, its passage out of committee will be a
landmark event that will clearly tell the White House that the
Congress, the public, and the computer industry care about security and
privacy, and need strong, reliable encryption technology in order to
make the Internet a viable platform for commerce, education, and
Success for our side is not certain, and the next week is not without risks.
On September 12th, the Senate Commerce committee will hold a "markup",
where the bill is examined, voted on, and if there are enough votes,
passed out of committee.  Two things could happen:
Any amendments are not likely to be friendly, and in particular, quiet
sources have told privacy activists that the Clinton Administration has been
readying a legislative assault on your right to use encryption for several
weeks now.  A Clipper-like amendment could be attached to the bill if
our side does not have enough votes to block all amendments.
It is crucial that all netizens who consider privacy and security important
take a moment to call members of the Commerce Committee right now and
urge them to vote S.1726 out of committee without amendments.
DESCRIPTION OF S.1726, PRO-CODE BILL
Privacy-enhancing encryption technology is currently under heavy restrictions
kept in place by the White House.  Encryption that is currently allowed to
be exported is not sufficient to protect confidential information.  This
policy acquires an "Alice-in-Wonderland" quality when one realizes that  strong encryption products are available abroad both for sale and for free
download off the Internet.
The Pro-CODE Act resolves to:
1.  Allow for the *unrestricted* export of "mass-market" or "public-domain"
    encryption programs, including such products as Pretty Good Privacy and
    popular World Wide Web browsers.
2.  Requires the Secretary of Commerce to allow the less restricted export
    of other encryption technologies if products of similar strength are
    generally available outside the United States, roughly up to DES
    strength.
3.  Prohibits the federal government from imposing mandatory key-escrow
    encryption policies on the domestic market and limiting the authority
    of the Secretary of Commerce to set standards for encryption products.
CHRONOLOGY OF PRO-CRYPTO LEGISLATION
9/12/96 (scheduled)
Senate Commerce committee will hold markup of S.1726 and hopefully pass it
out of committee with no amendments.

free public-domain encryption software (such as PGP) for export, free much
commercial encryption for export, and reduce the government's ability to
push Clipper proposals down the throats of an unwilling public.  Original
sponsors include: Senators Burns (R-MT), Dole (R-KS), Faircloth (R-NC),
Leahy (D-VT), Murray (D-WA), Pressler (R-SD), and Wyden (D-OR).
3/5/96: Sen. Leahy (D-VT) and Rep. Goodlatte (R-VA) announce encryption bills
(S.1587/H.R.3011) that significantly relax export restrictions on products
with encryption functionality in them, as well as free public domain software
such as PGP (Pretty Good Privacy).

THE LATEST NEWS
Sometimes things work out better than imagined.  This was the feeling
tonight as I waded through my email from people all over the country that
called the commerce committee.  This was the feeling as I heard from visitors
to one Senator's office who, while waiting for a few minutes in the lobby,
listened to the receptionist take two quick calls from netizens calling
about the bill.
Receptionist, cutting the caller off: "S.1726?  Yes, I'll pass that along
to the Senator, thanks.  We've been getting a lot of calls."
Another netizen emailed us saying that he also called his Representative.
It turns out this Rep. has some friends who have co-sponsored HR 3011, the
House version of Pro-CODE.  The calls and elevated publicity from this phone
campaign have convinced him to consider co-sponsoring HR 3011.
This is great, but our success has mobilized the anti-crypto forces
into action as well.  The Clinton Administration, who has long opposed
the right of citizens to use non-Clipper encryption, has begun working
behind the scenes to make sure that the vote on Pro-CODE (S.1726) never
To have the Senate Commerce committee go on record that encryption exports
should be loosened, against the will of the Administration, would be
an embarrassment to the White House.  They have begun pushing hard to
pressure Democratic Commerce Committee members to put the brakes on the
bill, and do everything they can to prevent the vote this Thursday.
To see the business community, the industry, and the public line up the
Administration would be extremely hard to take and still seem
It's crucial that we continue to make noise and ring those phones.  By
pulling enough favors with members of the Senate Commerce Committee, it's
possible that the White House could prevent this vote from happening.
WE MUST NOT LET THAT HAPPEN.  Appropriately forward this to everyone you
know until the expiration listed above.  Go to work, bug your neighbor

THE LATEST NEWS
The Senate Commerce Committee vote on S.1726 (Pro-CODE) originally set for
today (Thursday 9/12) has been postponed. We have been told that the change
was largely due to committee scheduling issues, and the Committee staff and
have indicated that they are still committeed to marking up S. 1726 within
the next.  More information should be available shortly.
Senator Conrad Burns (R-MT), co-author of S. 1726, asked us to forward the
following note to the net.community:

   Subject: Open Letter to the Internet from Senator Burns
     The Commerce Committee markup on Pro-CODE, S. 1726, that we had
     expected to have held on Thursday, September 12 has been postponed.  I
     am fully committed to taking Pro-CODE to markup, out of committee and
     onto the floor of the Senate in this Congress.  I believe that this
     legislation is vital to ensuring the continued strength of America's
     high-tech community and the privacy of its citizens.  I would like to
     thank the many thousands of Netizens who have expressed their support
     for Pro-CODE.
     Sincerely,
     U.S. Senator Conrad Burns
It is critical to keep your phone calls and faxes coming into the offices
of the Committee members listed below.  Based on the feedback we are
receiving from callers and conversations with Capitol Hill staff, the
response from the Net has been strong and continuous.  Thank you to all who
have taken the time to call Congress to voice your support for encryption
policy reform.
If you have not yet done so, please take a moment to call the committee
members below.  If you have a little extra time on your hands, between now
and the middle of next week please make an effort to call all the Senators
on the list below.  Your help and support is critical to the future of
privacy and security on the Internet.
Finally, please don't forget to sign the petition in support of Encryption
Policy Reform --    More than 4000 Netizens
have already signed, including encryption experts Phil Zimmermann, Matt
Blaze, Phil Karn, and others.
WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW
It's crucial that you call the Commerce committee members below and
urge them to pass S.1726 out of committee without amendments.  (This is
also known as a "clean" bill.)  Any opportunity for amendments (even if
they are good) opens us up to the possibility of hostile amendments
that could restrict the use of encryption even further than today's
abysmal state.  It could even prohibit the use of encryption without
Clipper Chip-like key 'escrow' technology, which includes built-in
surveillance and monitoring functionality.
1. Call/Fax the members of the Senate Commerce committee and urge
   them to pass S.1726 out of committee "cleanly".  Do not use email,
   as it is not likely to be looked at in time to make a difference.
   Use the sample communique and directory listing below to make it a
   simple TWO MINUTE task.
2. Sign the petition to support strong encryption at
      !  Join other cyber-heroes as
   Phil Zimmermann, Matt Blaze, Bruce Schneier, Vince Cate, Phil Karn, and
   others who have also signed.
3. Over the next 7 days, it is crucial that you call all these members of
   the Senate Commerce Committee.

BACKGROUND / WHAT TO EXPECT THIS WEEK
For the past 3 years, Cyber-Rights Activists, citizens, and industry
leaders have been working hard to reform US encryption policy.
Support has been building behind several legislative proposals this
year because they send a clear signal to the Administration about the
need for security and privacy in the Information Age.  The digital
revolution is currently being held hostage by the White House's Cold
War restrictions on privacy-enhancing encryption technology.
Now, with Congress less than a month away from adjournment, everyone
who supports encryption and privacy is working to see this bill leave
committee in order to send a clear message to the White House that they
are on the wrong side of the encryption issue.  Although this bill may
not become law this year, its passage out of committee will be a
landmark event that will clearly tell the White House that the
Congress, the public, and the computer industry care about security and
privacy, and need strong, reliable encryption technology in order to
make the Internet a viable platform for commerce, education, and
Success for our side is not certain, and the next week is not without risks.
On September 12th (or sometime soon after), the Senate Commerce committee
is expected to hold a "markup", where the bill is examined, voted on, and
if there are enough votes, passed out of committee.  Two things could
        -the committee could pass the bill as written,
        -the committee could pass the bill with amendments.
Any amendments are not likely to be friendly, and in particular, quiet
sources have told privacy activists that the Clinton Administration has been
readying a legislative assault on your right to use encryption for several
weeks now.  A Clipper-like amendment could be attached to the bill if
our side does not have enough votes to block all amendments.
It is crucial that all netizens who consider privacy and security important
take a moment to call members of the Commerce Committee right now and
urge them to vote S.1726 out of committee without amendments.
DESCRIPTION OF S.1726, PRO-CODE BILL
Privacy-enhancing encryption technology is currently under heavy restrictions
kept in place by the White House.  Encryption that is currently allowed to
be exported is not sufficient to protect confidential information.  This
policy acquires an "Alice-in-Wonderland" quality when one realizes that
strong encryption products are available abroad both for sale and for free
download off the Internet.
The Pro-CODE Act resolves to:
1.  Allow for the *unrestricted* export of "mass-market" or "public-domain"
    encryption programs, including such products as Pretty Good Privacy and
    popular World Wide Web browsers.
2.  Requires the Secretary of Commerce to allow the less restricted export
    of other encryption technologies if products of similar strength are
    generally available outside the United States, roughly up to DES
    strength.
3.  Prohibits the federal government from imposing mandatory key-escrow
    encryption policies on the domestic market and limiting the authority
    of the Secretary of Commerce to set standards for encryption products.

WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW
HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE TO VOTE ON "SAFE" PRO-INTERNET PRIVACY BILL
The House Judiciary Committee is set to vote on a bill designed to protect
privacy and promote electronic commerce on the Internet as early as the
second week of May.  The SAFE bill will also be considered by a Judiciary
subcommittee this week and is expected to pass without difficulty.
The House Judiciary committee vote on HR695 will mark a critical stage
in the effort to pass real reform of US encryption policy in a way that
protects privacy, promotes electronic commerce, and recognizes the
realities of the global Internet.
Although no bill is perfect, Internet advocates including CDT, EFF,
EPIC, VTW and others, including the Internet Privacy Coalition, have
expressed support for the bill.  Supporters agree that the SAFE bill
holds great promise for enhancing privacy and security on the Internet
and have offered their strong support and suggestions to improve it in
a detailed letter at Please take a moment to read the attached alert, and make a phone call to urge the committee to pass the bill.

BACKGROUND ON SAFE (HR 695)
In early May, the Judiciary Committee will be voting on whether to send
HR 695, the Security and Freedom Through Encryption (SAFE) Act, on to the
full House of Representatives.
The SAFE Bill, introduced by Reps. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) and Anna Eshoo
(D-CA), would promote privacy and security on the Internet by:
* relaxing current export controls on encryption technologies;
* prohibiting the government from imposing "key-escrow" or "key-
  recovery" inside the United States, and;
* addresses concerns from law enforcement about the use of encryption
  in the furtherance of a crime.
The SAFE bill enjoys broad bi-partisan support and currently has 78
Although no bill is ever perfect, the SAFE bill, along with Pro-CODE, a
similar bill in the Senate sponsored by Sens. Burns (R-MT) and Leahy
(D-VT), represent the best chance yet of passing real reform of US
encryption policy.  The Senate Commerce Committee is expected to hold a
markup on Pro-CODE soon.
The Clinton Administration, through the FBI and NSA, is working hard
behind the scenes to block passage of SAFE and Pro-CODE. The
Administration favors an approach which would limit the availability of
privacy-protecting encryption technologies and compel American Citizens
to ensure law enforcement access to their private online
By passing the SAFE bill and sending on to the floor, the House
Judiciary Committee will send a strong signal to the Administration
that Congress is serious about passing real reform of US encryption
policy, and would represent an important victory in the fight for
privacy on the Internet.

ALERT - SENATE COMMITTEE SET TO VOTE ON BILL TO GUARANTEE GOVERNMENT ACCESS
TO YOUR PRIVATE ONLINE COMMUNICATIONS
On Tuesday June 17, Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Bob Kerrey (D-NE)
introduced legislation which would all but mandate that Americans provide
guaranteed government access to their private online communications and
stored files.
The bill, known as "The Secure Public Networks Act of 1997" (S.909)
represents a full scale assault on your right to protect the privacy and
confidentiality of your online communications. Please take a moment to read
the instructions below and, if your Senator is a member of the Commerce
Committee, please take a moment to call your Senator TODAY!
Though offered on Capitol Hill as a compromise, the McCain-Kerrey bill is
virtually identical to draft legislation proposed earlier this year by the
Clinton Administration while doing nothing to protect the privacy and
security of Internet users. The bill closely mirrors  draft legislation
proposed by the Clinton Administration earlier this Spring.
Specifically, the bill would:
 * Compel Americans to Use Government-Approved Key Recovery Systems
 * Make Key Recovery a Condition Of Participation in E-Commerce
 * Allow Government Carte Blanche Access to Sensitive Encryption Keys
   Without a Court Order
 * Create New Opportunities for Cybercrimes
 * Codify a low 56-bit Key Length Limit on Encryption Exports
 * Create Broad New Criminal Penalties for the Use of Encryption
The full text of the bill, along with a detailed analysis, is available
online at WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW
On Thursday June 19, the Senate Commerce Committee is scheduled to hold a
vote on S. 377, the Promotion of Commerce Online in the Digital Era
(Pro-CODE) Act - an Internet-friendly encryption reform bill sponsored by
Senators Burns (R-MT) and Leahy (D-VT).
Senator McCain, the Commerce Committee Chairman, is expected to try and
substitute his proposal for Pro-CODE - gutting the proposal and inserting
provisions which would all but mandate guaranteed government access to your
private communications.

Encryption technologies are the locks and keys of the Information age,
enabling individuals and businesses to protect sensitive information
as it is transmitted over the Internet. As more and more individuals
and businesses come online, the need for strong, reliable, easy-to-use
encryption technologies has become a critical issue to the health and
viability of the Net.
Current US encryption policy, which limits the strength of encryption
products US companies can sell abroad, also limits the availability of
strong, easy-to-use encryption technologies in the United States. US
hardware and software manufacturers who wish to sell their products on
the global market must either conform to US encryption export limits or
produce two separate versions of the same product, a costly and
complicated alternative.
The export controls, which the NSA and FBI argue help to keep strong
encryption out of the hands of foreign adversaries, are having the
opposite effect. Strong encryption is available abroad, but because of
the export limits and the confusion created by nearly four years of
debate over US encryption policy, strong, easy-to-use privacy and
security technologies are not widely available off the shelf or "on the
net" here in the US.
A recently discovered flaw in the security of the new digital telephone
network exposed the worst aspects of the Administration's encryption
policy.  Because the designers needed to be able to export their
products, the system's security was "dumbed down".  Researchers
subsequently discovered that it is quite easy to break the security of the
system and intrude on what should be private conversations.
This incident underscores the larger policy problem: US companies are
at a competitive disadvantage in the global marketplace when competing
against companies that do not have such hindrances.  And now, for the first
time in history, the Clinton Administration and members of the US Senate
have proposed DOMESTIC RESTRICTIONS on the ability of Americans to protect
their privacy and security online.
All of us care about our national security, and no one wants to make it
any easier for criminals and terrorists to commit criminal acts. But we
must also recognize encryption technologies can aid law enforcement
and protect national security by limiting the threat of industrial
espionage and foreign spying, promote electronic commerce and protecting
What's at stake in this debate is nothing less than the future of
privacy and the fate of the Internet as a secure and trusted medium for
commerce, education, and political discourse.

WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW
On March 26, 1997, the Clinton Administration proposed draft legislation
which would, for the first time, impose DOMESTIC RESTRICTIONS on the
ability of Americans to protect their privacy and security online.
In its current form, the draft bill seeks to impose a risky
"key-recovery" regime which would compel American citizens to ensure
government access to their private communications. Law enforcement and
national security agents would not even need a court order to access
private decryption keys.
Congress is currently considering three separate bills which would
prohibit the government from imposing "key-recovery" domestically, and
encourage the development of easy-to-use, privacy and security tools
for the Net.
As more and more Americans come online, the Administration's plan is a
giant step backwards and would open a huge window of vulnerability to
the private communications of Internet users.  Americans expect more
when conducting private conversations with their doctors, families,
business partners, or lawyers.
Please read the Alert below to find out what you can do to protect your
privacy online.

@_subject: SAFE Bill discussion 
The Administration hates this bill, because it threatens their ability to
roll out Key Recovery.  They've said as much in the letter Declan forwarded:
   "The bill could be read as prohibiting the United States government
    from using appropriate incentives to support a key management
    infrastructure and KEY RECOVERY." [emphasis added]
Do you think that if this bill helped the Administration, that they'd be
out there urging the subcommittee chairman to stop it?  I think not.
I'm also puzzled by the fact that CDT is being criticized pretty much
solely, even though the entire Internet Privacy Coalition, and several
other groups all wrote a letter of support of the bill with only a
criticism of one provision.  However the overall statement was of support.
(see As far as I can tell, everyone criticizing the bill either thinks that:
           is needed and are doing the best they can with what Congress has
           written.
You're pretty hard on CDT, but EFF, EPIC, the ACLU, VTW, Americans for Tax
Reform, the Association for Computing Machinery, Computer Professionals for
Social Responsiblity, Eagle Forum, the National Association for Criminal
Defense Lawyers, and PGP Inc all signed this letter.
Can you consider, perhaps, for a second, that critics of SAFE are being
unreasonable?  I would think so, as critics of SAFE include the Clinton
Administration.  Is that the kind of company that cypherpunks keep?
Here's a great excerpt from the Internet Privacy Coalition letter:
  The pending bill provides a positive framework for the reforms that are
  long overdue in this critical area. It makes clear that the sale or use
  encryption, a vital technique to promote network security and individual
  privacy, should not be restricted in the United States. This is the view
  widely shared by users of the Internet and the computer and communications
  industry. It was also a central recommendation of the
  report of the National Research Council last year.
Looks like widespread support from people who study this issue for living.
I'm glad to be counted among them.

Ah, so here is the source of all the conspiracy theories:
The Internet Privacy Coalition letter, which said, (paraphrased) "we support
this bill but have concerns over the criminal provision" was coordinated by
EPIC, not CDT.  Hey, if you don't believe me, here's an excerpt from Audrie
Krause's NetAction notes (see   Earlier this week, EPIC staffers again sent out an E-mail alert, this time
  to members of the Internet Privacy Coalition requesting their signature on a
  letter to Rep. Robert Goodlatte (R-VA) [..]
  Again within a matter of days, EPIC was able to deliver a letter signed by
  25 organizations, including NetAction.  The letter is on the Web, at:
  .
If you don't believe EPIC coordinated this letter, give Marc Rotenberg a
call at 202-544-9240. He's the one who called VTW to sign on, and when I
called him back to say thank you for distributing the letter, I asked him
to signon VTW.  Of course, the ACLU also signed the letter, saying they
support the bill but have concerns over the criminal provision.  You can
call them here in New York at 212-982-9800 (I think).  Barry signed the
letter, ask him.
By attacking the supporters of the bill, you're attacking CDT, the ACLU,
EPIC, VTW, EFF, Eagle Forum, Americans for Tax Reform, and PGP Inc.  You're
saying that all the Internet advocates have turned against crypto?
I don't think so.  I think you're sense of perspective is out of whack.

Declan, I can't believe you did your research so poorly.  Go look at the
Internet Privacy Coalition letter at
 or go to the crypto.com SAFE
bill page at  and read the pointer from
You'll see that CDT signed the very same letter that EPIC, ACLU, EFF, ATR,
Eagle Forum, VTW, and PGP all signed.

Actually, I think you do.  There aren't any other groups out there who sent
letters urging the entire subcommittee to start hacking on the bill at the
subcommittee level.  Even the IPC letter to Goodlatte said to address the
issue at the full committee level.
That seems to be the strategy everyone is pursuing, so if you're going to
attack CDT for it, you had better include VTW, the ACLU, EPIC, EFF, et al.

Thanks Marc, for the efforts at clearing things.  The CDT letter was sent
to the subcommittee, for reasons we've all already talked about (that these
issues are better handled at the full committee).
The Internet Privacy Coalition letter, which we all signed, was sent to
Goodlatte and contains the following quote:
   For the reasons set forth below, we recommend that this provision be
   reconsidered when the COMMITTEE considers the bill. [emphasis added]
Note, that Committee means full Committee, not subcommittee.

ENCRYPTION BATTLE HEATS UP IN THE HOUSE
On May 14th, the House Judiciary Committee approved a bill designed to
dramatically enhance the ability of Internet users to protect their privacy
and security online.
The bill now moves to the House International Relations Committee, where it
is expected to face tougher opposition from the FBI, NSA, and the Clinton
Administration.  The International Relations Committee is expected to
consider the bill soon.
The Security and Freedom through Encryption Act (SAFE - HR 695) will
prohibit the government from imposing mandatory law enforcement access to
private online communications inside the US, affirm the right of American
Citizens to use whatever from of encryption they choose, and relax current
export restrictions which prevent the development of strong, easy-to-use
encryption technologies.
The Clinton Administration, led by the FBI and the National Security
agency, opposes SAFE and is pushing for a policy of domestic restrictions
on the use of encryption, guaranteed law enforcement access to private
communications via government designed "key-recovery" systems, and
continued reliance on out-dated, cold-war era export controls.
For the first time in history, Congress is close to passing real encryption
policy reform legislation which will protect privacy, promote electronic
commerce, and recognizes the realities of the global Internet.  Pointers
to additional information on the SAFE bill and other efforts to reform
U.S. encryption policy are attached below.

CRYPTOGRAPHERS AND COMPUTER SECURITY EXPERTS ASSAIL GOV'T. KEY RECOVERY PLANS
On Wednesday May 21, a group of leading cryptographers and computer
scientists released a report which for the first time examines the
risks and implications of government-designed key-recovery systems.
The report cautions that "The deployment of a general key-recovery-based
encryption infrastructure to meet law enforcement's stated requirements
will result in substantial sacrifices in security and cost to the end user.
Building a secure infrastructure of the breathtaking scale and complexity
demanded by these requirements is far beyond the experience and current
competency of the field."
The report substantially changes the terms of the ongoing debate over US
encryption policy.  For more than four years, the Clinton Administration
has pushed for a policy of continued export restrictions on strong
encryption, and the development of global key escrow and key recovery
systems to address the concerns of law enforcement.  The study, the first
comprehensive analysis of the risks of key recovery and key escrow systems,
calls into question the viability of the Administration's approach.
The Report's authors, recognized leaders in the cryptography and computer
science field, include Hal Abelson, Ross Anderson, Steven M. Bellovin, Josh
Benaloh,  Matt Blaze, Whitfield Diffie, John Gilmore, Peter G. Neumann,
Ronald L. Rivest, Jeffery I. Schiller, and Bruce Schneier

has pushed for a policy of continued export restrictions on strong
encryption, and the development of global key escrow and key recovery
systems to address the concerns of law enforcement.  The study, the first
comprehensive analysis of the risks of key recovery and key escrow systems,
calls into question the viability of the Administration's approach.
The Report's authors, recognized leaders in the cryptography and computer
science field, include Hal Abelson, Ross Anderson, Steven M. Bellovin, Josh
Benaloh,  Matt Blaze, Whitfield Diffie, John Gilmore, Peter G. Neumann,
Ronald L. Rivest, Jeffery I. Schiller, and Bruce Schneier

      Stop the Government From Building Big Brother Into The Internet
      What You Can Do
            -Please contact four leading members of Congress
      Background
      About This Alert
STOP THE GOVERNMENT FROM BUILDING BIG BROTHER INTO THE INTERNET
In 1948, George Orwell described a future world in which Big Brother
peaked over the shoulder of every citizen -- watching every move and
listening to every word.
Now, in 1997, the FBI is pushing the United States Congress to pass
legislation which would make George Orwell's frightening vision a reality.
Next week the House Commerce Committee will meet to consider a
proposal that would require all Americans to provide the government
guaranteed access to their private online communications and business
transactions.  Taking a page out of Orwell's 1984, the FBI-spawned
proposal would require that every part of the Internet -- from the
software on your computer to the network provider that carries your
messages around the net -- be jury-rigged to divulge your private
conversations immediately on request by the FBI (see below).
Unfortunately, this is not a work of fiction.
The amendment, to be offered by Representatives Mike Oxley (R-OH) and
Thomas Manton (D-NY), is a serious threat to your privacy and represents
the first and final step in the construction of a National Surveillance
A vote is expected on September 25.  The future of privacy and security
in the information age is in the hands of the Commerce Committee, and
they need to know that folks are watching and care about the outcome.
On Monday September 22, please join thousands of Internet users all across
the country as we call on Congress to stop big brother.  With your help and
support,  we can ensure that George Orwell's 1984 does not become a reality.
All the information you need is attached below.
WHAT YOU CAN DO
1. ON MONDAY SEPTEMBER 22, pick up the phone and call as many of the four
   leading members of the Commerce committee as you can:
     Chairman Thomas Bliley (R-VA)         (202) 225-2815
     Ranking member John Dingell (D-MI)   (202) 225-4071
     Rep. Tauzin (R-LA)                    (202) 225-4031
     Rep. Markey (D-MA)                    (202) 225-2836
2. Ask for the staffer that handles the encryption issue.
3. Say that you're calling to urge the Congressman to pass SAFE (HR695)
   without amendments.
   Specifically, say that you "OPPOSE THE OXLEY/MANTON BIG BROTHER AMENDMENT.
   Americans should not be required to give the government keys to the front
   door of their house, and they shouldn't be required to give the government
   the keys to unlock their private online communications."
Other amendments may be proposed.  Please urge the Congressman to pass SAFE
"as is" and oppose any amendments. Feel free to use your own words though
here are some points you might want to stress:
- Oxley/Manton is a dramatic expansion of law enforcement power.  It would
   give law enforcement "immediate" access to private online communications
   and business transactions without any notice or knowledge to the user.
- Oxley/Manton is NOT A BALANCE BETWEEN PRIVACY INTERESTS AND LAW
   ENFORCEMENT CONCERNS, as some supporters have argued.  It gives the FBI
   broad new power while stripping Americans of their Fourth Amendment right
   to be secure from unreasonable searches and seizures.
- Oxley/Manton would give the Attorney General authority to dictate the
   design of Internet services and software to suit the needs of law
   enforcement.
- Oxley/Manton would not stop crime. Strong encryption without "immediate
   access" features is available today at home and abroad.
- Oxley/Manton would increase opportunities for cybercrime as criminal hackers
   attack vulnerabilities in the key recovery access system.
4. Let us know how it went!  Go to one of the following web pages, depending
   on who you called, and tell us about the conversation.
   Rep. Bliley        Rep. Dingell       Rep. Tauzin        Rep. Markey     5. Forward this ALERT to your friends and colleagues.
6. Feel good about yourself!  Know that you've stood up for privacy, and
   contacting Congress is more than most people take the time to do!
The House Commerce Committee is considering a bill known as the "Security and
Freedom through Encryption Act" (HR 695, a.k.a. SAFE).  SAFE would
encourage the widespread availability of strong, easy-to-use encryption
technologies in order to protect privacy and promote electronic commerce on
the Internet.  SAFE enjoys broad support from Internet users, civil
liberties advocates, and over 250 members of Congress.
Last week, the Commerce Committee delayed its vote on the SAFE bill in
order to give the Committee more time to study the implications of the
Oxley/Manton amendment, which would change SAFE to ban encryption which
does not contain features that provide law enforcement with "immediate
access" to the plain text of encrypted information, including private
communications and business transactions (visit
The Oxley/Manton amendment would for the first time impose sweeping
restrictions on the ability of American citizens to protect their privacy
on US soil. Specifically, the amendment would:
* PROHIBIT THE DOMESTIC MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF ENCRYPTION PRODUCTS OR
  SERVICES WHICH DO NOT PROVIDE INSTANT ACCESS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT: The
  proposal would prohibit the manufacture, sale, import, or distribution
  within the United States of any encryption product unless it allows
  "immediate access" to the plain text of any user's messages or files
  without the user's knowledge.
* GRANT BROAD NEW AUTHORITY FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO SET TECHNICAL
  STANDARDS FOR ENCRYPTION PRODUCTS: The proposal allows the Attorney
  General to set standards for what are and are not acceptable
  encryption products. The proposal's requirement of immediate access to
  plain text would seem to seriously limit the options available to
  encryption manufacturers seeking approval of their products.
The amendment does not specify whether the immediate access "features"
could be activated (or not) at the option of the purchaser or end user.
Nonetheless,  requiring that such a capability be installed in all domestic
communications networks and encryption products is the equivalent of
enabling a national surveillance infrastructure and asserts unprecedented
control over the design of Internet software, hardware, and services.
The amendment is analogous to the government requiring surveillance cameras
in every new house built in the United States, which could be turned on
remotely by the police if you were ever suspected of committing a crime.
Worse yet, such "key escrow" or "key recovery" technologies pose
significant risk to the security of the Internet -- providing new
points of vulnerability for hackers, terrorists, and industrial spies
to exploit.  A recent study by 11 of the worlds leading cryptographers
concluded that the large scale deployment of such technologies would be
too complex and too insecure to meet the needs of an Information Age
society (see Despite widespread opposition from Internet users, civil liberties
groups, privacy advocates, and the computer and communications
industries, Oxley and Manton plan to push for this FBI spawned amendment
at the Commerce Committee vote.  If it is adopted, it would
represent the first and final step in the development of a national
surveillance infrastructure.

As each committee gets their hands on the bill, they do their own changes
to versions and then they are all merged later before going to the floor.
So, no, we're not asking people to urge passage of the SAFE bill with all
the awful National Security amendments.
It's a good suggestion, which we'll make clearer next time.
