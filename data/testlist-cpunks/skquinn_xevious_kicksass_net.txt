For a firewall, I'd recommend OpenBSD over just about anything else. Unless of course, there is hardware you need to use that isn't supported under OpenBSD.

@_subject: Multiple copies of messages 
Just today, I started getting multiple copies of each message. Am I the only person this is happening to?

I noticed something similar when I voted in the primary this year. I
voted in the Republican primary, and there were *two* choices for
president: Bush and "Undecided" (or maybe it was "Uncommitted").
Anyway, my question: can you decline to vote on an office-by-office
basis, or is it all or nothing?

I was off the list for a while, and only rarely posted when I was on it. I just didn't have the time for the better part of a year. But, now I'm back into studying security/privacy/cryptography stuff so I'll probably be on the list again for a long while.
