Clinton's Job Approval Rating Up Broad Support for Strikes By Gary Langer
ABCNEWS Polling Analyst
Aug. 21 ï¿½ Americans overwhelmingly support
the U.S. strikes against suspected terrorist sites
in Afghanistan and Sudan, and by a 2-1 margin
they reject the suggestion that President Clinton
ordered the attack to divert attention from the
Monica Lewinsky scandal, an ABCNEWS poll
has found. Job Approval Up
Eighty percent support the missile attack,
and 64 percent believe Clinton ordered it
ï¿½mainly to fight terrorism,ï¿½ not because
he wanted to turn attention away from the Lewinsky case.
Thirty percent subscribe to the ï¿½Wag the Dogï¿½ theory;
thatï¿½s been about the size of Clintonï¿½s hard-core
detractors since the Lewinsky scandal broke.
        Thursday nightï¿½s survey found a five-point increase
in Clintonï¿½s job
approval rating,
to 65
best in ABC polling since early April. And 68 percent say
they trust him to handle the U.S. response to
terrorismï¿½even though, in an ABCNEWS poll
Wednesday night, a record low of 24 percent rated him
as ï¿½honest and trustworthy.ï¿½
             Support for the strikes
                                  Yes
                                       No
 Support the missile strike
                                 80%                                       14%  Trust Clinton to handle terrorism
                                 68%                                       28%  Approve of Clinton's job performance
                                 65%                                       32% Will Strikes Reduce Terrorism?
The public divides evenly on whether the missile strikes
will reduce terrorism directed against the United States, or
increase it. Among those who expect the strikes to reduce
terrorism, 98 percent are in support. But even among
those who expect it to increase terrorism, 68 percent
support the U.S. missile strikes nonetheless. Support also
is non-partisan, drawing eight in 10 Democrats,
Republicans and independents alike.         Finally, 55 percent said they do think the Lewinsky
matter is interfering with Clintonï¿½s ability to serve
effectively as president. But considerably fewerï¿½about
half that numberï¿½think itï¿½s interfering ï¿½a great deal.ï¿½
        This survey was conducted by telephone Thursday
night among a random national sample of 510 adults. The
results have a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 points.

This brings to mind again a method of distribution that I've thought for
some time and has probably been discussed on this list before.  In this
distribution method, as long as there is the opportunity to cooperate ahead
of time and out of band, there is the potential for retaining the ability
to provide access any binary data that would be subject to unwanted control.
The scheme is just a variation of secret sharing and all that is necessary
is for several different entities to replicate portions of the desired
software, which portions in and of themselves cannot be subject to any
For (a trivial) example take the image of PGP zipped up for download.
Three different sites create a unique portion of that image for themselves,
for example, each site takes every third byte, and throw in some additional
obfuscation by each site XORing their portion of the image by some
additional data available at a fourth site such as a collection of
cypherpunk list text.
It then is trivial to reconstruct the desired image from the independent
sources, while none of the sources themselves can be subject to controls
without having to go down the rat hole of having to define what really
constitutes the restricted material -- either in all possible forms, or in
terms of all possible transforms applicable to the partitioned source
material.  Otherwise it could be argued that there is a function and that
takes the image of an ASCII representation of Herman Melville's Moby Dick
into the image of PGP.ZIP and therefore Moby Dick is an export controlled
item.  Or is the transform the export-controlled item?  Or what?

there must be something here that I'm missing.  At the core of this
protocol seems to be the establishment not of crypto anarchy but of a
crypto elite. in this scheme only the processors of computing power  have
economic power.  Now I realize that our current economic system is based on
economic power being invested in a closed community of powerful elites, and
is by no means egalitarian, but this looks to be like simply substituting
one group of "haves" for a different group of "haves"
I have to admit not being familiar with the Orthodoxy of crypto anarchy,
but if the premise is a centerless self organizing system of free agents
this protocol seems to miss the mark. or what is it that I am missing here?

the point is not to hide anything; the point is to expand, arbitrarily (and
this was a trivial example), the f() that takes bits from a controllable
image to one that is not.
in a cruise missle, there will be certain parts -- e.g. the warhead
explosives? -- that are still identifiable as controlled.  taking apart the
missle by n people where n is the number of 'parts' will result in some
subset of participants possessing components that implicate them in an
illegal act.  this is simply not true of bits.  What is the bit sequence
that defines "munition"-ness?  My point is that there is no hard point at
which that can be defined, when you start talking about mappings from a
controlled image to some other images which cannot be controlled. You're just asserting the assumptions I am trying to examine, and this is
not helpful.  You're also assuming a single participant, with
accountability.  I am assuming multiple participants, and that they're
acting independently; let's expand this to say that one individual provides
the 'algorithm' for the mapping, and any other participants are free to
obtain their image out of band legally, and implement this algorithm on
some portion of the image, publishing the result.  Whom do you arrest?
Where is the culpability?
If the algorithm defines that there be 256K subimages of the original, one
for each byte, say...can I be arrested for choosing to post f(byte
123,456)?  Or do I get arrested for publishing f(byte 123,456) PLUS the
information that identifies this byte as corresponding to byte 123,456 in
the reconstruction of the original?  I honestly don't know where this goes,
but to just make a blanket statement like you did doesn't really add anything.

Natrificial's "Brain" product did the same thing, silently, or at least via
a nonobvious option setting that was not explicitly documented.  The
transmittal of all your URL's to the mother ship was how they would inform
you that you were hitting a page specially enabled for their S/W.  Totally
unnecessary, as the page, if so enabled, would be perfectly capable of
notifying the browser with the addition of a trivial plugin, e.g. or other
thing.  I raised the issue of disclosing this kind of thing and got the
usual "we're technology users too and we'd NEVER do anything with that
information..." response, like it's no big deal.  I stopped using and
recommending the product, even though it looked like with the proper option
setting I would no longer be reporting my bizarre habits to Natrificial.

Text of RFE/RL President Kevin Klose's Statements
Prague, July 4 (RFE/RL) -- The following is a text of introductory remarks
by RFE/RL President Kevin Klose today at Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty:
On this Independence Day, 1996, the two-hundredth twentieth celebration of
the United States, we are also celebrating the second anniversary of the
decision to move Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty to the former federal
parliament building here in Prague. We are deeply honored that Mrs.
Clinton has chosen our headquarters from which to make an historic,
Indpendence Day address. History has taught that democracy cannot live in an information vacuum.
indeed, a well-informed citizenry is essential for democracy and free-market
economies to flourish. This powerful historic truth guides our radios each
day. Our servces in 23 languages provide accurate, objective news and
information to millions of people across 11 time zones. Citizens in newly-emancipated lands can be freed from the past by the power
of information itself to establish civil societies. The stakes are enormous.
Civil societies that guard human freedoms across our broadcast regions can
guarantee a stable, peaceful future for all of Europe and the world. Our
mission to assist democratic change, to combat nationalism and racism, must
not falter. Here at the radios you will find 350 Czechs and Americans, and men and
women from more than 20 other countries, working in harmony and partnership
to broadcast truthful information for the sake of our homelands and the
futures of our children. Thank you, one and all. Thank you, Mrs. Clinton, for joining us to
celebrate our Independence Day.                                        ï¿½ 1996 Radio Free Europe / Radio
Liberty, Inc.
