Pete StarkWell look at this! Just like Lieberman, Tom's top donor is Citigroup which stands to lose $3 billion in the Enron debacle. So it's really about the congressional whores attempting to salvage whatever monies available for their corporate masters. Yes, keep digging you idiots, the corpses are buried everywhere. Enrongate, we can hardly wait.
