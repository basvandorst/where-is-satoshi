@_subject: PHILIP ZIMMERMAN ARRESTED [NOT!] 
This is an April Fools' Day prank.  I spoke personally to Phil
and he is sitting comfortably in his own house (with the phone ringing
off the hook).

Philip Zimmerman, writer of the popular encryption program PGP, has been
arrested! He is being held on $1,000,000 bail. The charges against him are as follows: 1) Violating PKP's patent on RSA.
2) Allowing PGP to be distributed outside of the US.
I have just heard about this, since I work for the FBI (which is why I am
posting this anonymously), and will post more information when I can get it.
You may wish to set up a fund to help pay Zimmerman's bail.
