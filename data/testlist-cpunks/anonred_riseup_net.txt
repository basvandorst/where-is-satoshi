I think Adam really hit the nail on the head, here.  One of the most
significant, growing concerns people have had about the activities of
the NSA et al has been that it presents a great deal of risk.  No
security is perfect, and there's always a way in.  Given enough time,
some foreign threat (Chinese hackers?) will, almost certainly, find
their way into a datacenter and have access to an overwhelming amount of
I think that point makes for a strong case for regulating spying
programs.  The fact that this activity is so detrimental to privacy
rights is a much deeper and more important issue, in my mind, but both
are worth arguing for the sake of regaining control.
I also agree that, at the end of the day, the technology we use has to
do the job of keeping users secure- it's always been that way.  Adequate
legislation is also necessary, of course, but as others such as Richard
Stallman have recently said, laws have and will be ignored when they're
inconvenient for powerful parties such as the NSA.
Interesting times, indeed.  I for one am very excited about how
technology has and continues to change(d).
