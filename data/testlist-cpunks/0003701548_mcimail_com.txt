You might also want to check for low computron usage if you can and
generate a bunch of keys for later use when the machine is fairly
idle. (if it's ever in such a state - don't know if you are on a
multiuser system or not). that way, during peak times, you aren't burning big-time cycles generating keys. TM> As an aside, this is my general approach to things: I'll start off in

the above is how i code. of course, i'm not a professional - just
having a good time.

@_subject: 'brief' macro for invoking pgp 
hello all,
does anyone out there have a macro for the editor _brief_ by borland (last time i checked) that will invoke pgp to sign a message in the buffer. i've been using _brief_ as my primary editor since they were owned by _underware_, (no joke), and would like to be able to sign messages by pressing a hot key. i've been trying to do this off and on for some time, but my programming skills are almost nonexistant. preferably it would be filename independant. that is, it would work on the current buffer. the package was written
to be able to compile files while within it, so it should be
any help would be greatly appreciated.

true. thanks for the reminder of seals. i need to work this analogy into my
current 'lecture' on the usefullness of encryption.
_puzzle palace_ makes reference to british intellegence making use of people
trained into the use of people trained to reproduce seals. this is something for us to look out for from the fine folx at nsa. if there is a way to spoof
signatures (as mentioned in another thread recently), they will be perfecting
and perhaps using these methods if they feel the need is great enough.
i promote encryption using pgp with a lot of stress on the privacy and
veracity of documents in business settings. how strong is the hash used by pgp? do you think it will eventually be
hashed out in the courts in our favour?(pun semi-intended)
i'd like digital signatures w/verifiable timestamps be recognised in a
court of law. i don't know of any cases revolving around this issue.
if anyone out there knows of one, i'd be interested in hearing of it
so i can track it's progress.
btw: though it is a pain sometimes to weed the noise off this list due
to my (very) limited net access, it has proved to be an excellent
resource. my thanks to the regulars.

the most reasonable and easiest to implement solution to eliminating the
need for west's page number system is to just number each paragraph.
anyone can do this.

Hmm, how hard could it be to eliminate West page numbers?
There couldn't be more than a couple of cases on each page, if each page number were replaced by links to each case, a
lawyer could tell on the first glance which of the three was
right and mark it, assuming a reasonable HTML/SGML editor or
something.  Seems like it could be done as a part of daily work
and the results accreted somewhere.
