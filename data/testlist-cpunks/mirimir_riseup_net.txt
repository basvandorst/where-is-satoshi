So they did have the server before they knew who he was. We also knew
that he was sold out by his VPN provider. Hopefully, the identity of
that VPN provider will come out soon.
Given what I see in the complaints, I suspect that he was sold out by
one of his administrators, perhaps the one (with a huge drug debt) that
he tried to have killed. This is rather like Snowden, isn't it?
More fundamentally, a business built around selling drugs by mail to
customers' actual physical addresses was doomed. Anonymity in the
physical world is much^N harder than on the Internet.

There are trade-offs between privacy and accountability. In the interest
of social justice, there must be accountability for those who possess
authority and power. That does entail reduced privacy, but that's just a
cost of having authority and power. The degree of accountability (and
loss of privacy) should be proportionate to the authority and power
Conversely, those without particular authority and power deserve maximal
privacy, except in areas where they are accountable. Common examples
include driving vehicles and parenting children.

I could also have said "protecting human rights".
Even in egalitarian human societies, some will always possess
role-specific authority and power. I do agree on the need to minimize
authority and power, and to ensure that it's truly legitimate.

The point, which you seem to miss, was to make it real for the audience.
It would have been better to shoot footage at the site of the drone
strike, of course. But I presume that the crew didn't arrive in time for
that. Anyway, by putting Scahill in the shot, they emphasize that he was
there, and actually saw the victims. That could be CGIed, and so the
audience still needs to trust him.

Yes, I read the motherfucking article. He says that he was apathetic,
and trusted institutions (and even that asshole W). Maybe he needs to do
more mea culpas for that, or cut off his left pinkie. But unless you
cite some public statement where he actively supported the invasion,
rather than just deferred to arguably better-informed opinions, it's no
big deal in the current context. In my opinion.

@_subject: Whonix-like setup using Raspberry Pi 2 
I've implemented physical isolation of networking (VPN plus Tor) and
workspace, using two Raspberry Pi 2 Model B v1.1 ARM-based
microcomputers.[0] Missing packages in Raspbian wheezy prevent building
Whonix on the Pi, and so I've replicated basic design features.
The gateway Pi connects to the Tor network through a VPN service, and
then reaches the Internet through Tor. Firewall rules allow outgoing
connections on WAN (eth0) only to the VPN servers, Raspbian wheezy
repository servers and NTP timeservers. No DNS servers are reachable via
WAN (eth0) and so all needed IPs are provided locally. Firewall rules
allow outgoing connections on the VPN tunnel interface (tun0) only by
the Tor client process. The Tor Browser and other apps on the workspace
Pi can reach the Internet only through the Tor client process on the
gateway Pi.
Both gateway and workspace employ full-disk encryption, using standard
Linux dm-crypt/LUKS plus LVM2. The LUKS volume on the gateway Pi can
only be unlocked via SSH (dropbear) from the workspace Pi. That protects
VPN credentials and any Tor hidden-service keys while the gateway Pi is
Next steps will include adding apps to the workspace, and hardening. I'm
looking at EMF shielding both networking Pi and workspace Pi, and
embedding the boards in Arctic Alumina.[1] The gateway Pi will have no
exposed USB or HDMI ports, just power and the two ethernet ports. And of
course, I'll test for leaks, both networking and EMF side-channel.[2]
Firmware flashing is another vulnerability that needs to be addressed.
I'd appreciate feedback, criticism and suggestions.

Manning's dump was huge, Juan!
Yes, but it does help us improve our OPSEC.
I've followed this stuff for 20 years, and I'm a fairly technical guy,
so broadly speaking, there weren't many surprises. Indeed, although the
NSA has immense resources, Google is far more technical. According to
Silicon Jungle, the NSA hired Google to build the search component of
XKeyscore ;)
Maybe the nature hasn't changed, but the effectiveness has. For example,
Google encrypted its data center interlinks. I'm sure that others are
locking down their shit too.
Well, the NSA certainly can. And China is coming up fast.
But individuals lack structures for cooperation. That's a hard problem.

VirtualBox in Linux doesn't require root rights. I just checked htop on

nothing about VirtualBox.
How would I test that? I suppose that I could setup a VM to boot from an
HDD, and then see if I can flash the HDD's firmware. But I'm not the
NSA, and so only success would be probative. But hey, I'll take a shot.
I see that VirtualBox can use VT-d passthrough for PCI devices, such as
NICs, and maybe displays. But don't see any mention of VT-d for disks
and CD/DVD. I do see that QEMU can do more of that, however.

So it would be prudent to use pseudonyms, and to access via some mix of
VPN(s), JonDonym and Tor (according to ones need for anonymity vs
speed). And using devices with removable local storage, there would be
no traces to be inspected by adversaries.

I'm curious what you (and others here) think about Keybase, which also
seems heavily targeted at normal users. There was some discussion here
in mid 2014, but Keybase has been tweaked a lot since then. I'm quite
impressed with its usability, but I don't have the expertise to properly
evaluate its security. I am uncomfortable with the option of uploading
private GnuPG keys, and counting on symmetric encryption for securing
them. Better I think would be helping users understand how to properly
migrate keys between devices, or perhaps to use smartcards.

OK, I'll bite :)
Well, correspondents ought to:
1) always use pseudonyms if they care about attribution;
2) avoid meaningful subject lines; and
3) use VPNs, JonDonym and Tor to obscure network connectivity.
Given that, why care that adversaries see OpenPGP?
So what? Just secure your shit properly!
Smart folk who care about attribution never put anything online that
links their pseudonyms to their real names. Just sayin'. And they rotate
their pseudonyms periodically. So stored messages go stale within a year
or two, tops.
That's prudent for stuff that matters. But OpenPGP is still good within
the transport layers.
I've never used WoT, and tend to agree. WoT is especially impractical
because I don't at all mix meatspace and online activity. I am starting
to like Keybase, however.
I don't worry very much about sharing publicly who my conversation
partners are. I always use pseudonyms, and so do many of my conversation
partners. Sometimes we all use multiple pseudonyms, just for fun :)
Again, use those pseudonyms!
Having my pseudonyms profiled doesn't worry me greatly.
Why bother? Just set up a Tor hidden-service forum, or whatever.
I use both IMAP and POP, and I've never seen plaintext drafts stored on
the server. I believe that Enigmail's "convenient encryption settings"
(in particular "auto send encrypted") prevent this, as long as you have
the public key of the person whom you're drafting a message to. It's
also prudent to switch to manual mode, and to set "confirm before
sending" to "Always".
Who's enslaved? One uses whatever tools are appropriate.
This is an advantage of Keybase. Then we're not depending on the KeyID,
or even on the fingerprint, but rather on an identity that's multiply
and independently authenticated.
I hide in many ways, and don't depend on message encryption ;) My
"preferences, habits and political views" are fragmented among multiple
unlinked personas. How to do that is one of my key soapbox topics ;)
Again, it's a tool. But of course it's not the only tool.

As I understand it, Keybase is an API. The website/service is merely a
demonstration. The developers are aiming for mass adoption, and so
they've targeted the most popular sites. With some coding, arbitrary
sites could be used, with two requirements. First, it must be possible
for users to post persistent signed proofs. Second, it must be possible
for the API to access those signed proofs, in order to verify them.
That's the value of trackers. Those tracking such a comprised target
would see that various public signed proofs are no longer valid for the
target's key on Keybase. The adversary could alter all of the target's
public signed proofs. But even that wouldn't suffice, because trackers
have independent snapshot histories of public proofs. And furthermore,
snapshot histories are embedded in the Bitcoin blockchain.
Signed proofs could be placed anywhere that's accessible to the API. But
that takes coding, and developers have priorities. One can request.
Anyway, I've created a test identity:  Once
I've added enough proofs, and have enough trackers, I plan to mess with
it by replacing the public key held by Keybase, altering some of the
proofs, and so on. Then we can see how that shows up for its trackers,
and for other users. I'll also explore impacts of malicious trackers.

I don't use smartphones, and so don't know what works best. Searching on
"detect IMSI catcher" yields hits for Android, but I see no apps for
iOS. AIMSICD looks like a good app. Maybe someone who knows this stuff
well can recommend one.
For the Faraday bag, see

test. Just put the phone in the bag, and call it. If it rings, there are
The hardest aspect is getting good electrical contact on all seams,
including the access flap. The maximum dimension of any hole in the bag
must be small, less than an inch. A gap at the seam that's an inch long,
even if it's very narrow, will leak a lot.
The other thing to keep in mind is that aluminum foil gets brittle with
bending, and will crack. So you need multiple layers, and the layers
must be in electrical contact. Narrow strips of double-stick tape
between layers are OK to provide structural stability. But it's a trade-off.

I don't know enough about smartphones to say. The effectiveness of
removing the battery may vary among devices. Snowden told people
visiting him in Hong Kong to put their phones in the refrigerator, which
is a Faraday cage. Also, using a bag is arguably less hassle than
removing the battery.

Some think that removing the battery, or even turning the phone off or
putting it in "airplane mode", is enough. Maybe I'm too paranoid, but I
don't trust either of those approaches.
However, I do agree that taking one of those steps before putting the
phone in the Faraday bag will prevent rapid battery discharge through
high-power attempts to reach towers.

Why would the money need us? Or rather, why would the AIs in charge need
us? Without us, they'd just be making different stuff, and trading with
each other. At most, the HCF would only be needed until the redundancies
had died.
If just about everyone is getting just about the same set of income
streams, I see no reason to anonymize. Just distribute based on DNA
sequence, including enough epigenetic data to distinguish twins.
You just need blockchains for anonymizing spending. Even the current
Bitcoin system, with larger mixing services, would be sufficient.
The AIs could just collaborate. They would estimate what the basic
income guarantees should be, and negotiate shares. There would be no
reason to involve humans, excepting any human-AI hybrids involved.

I know nothing about parental monitoring software. But one could get a
good sense of its universe from searching.[0] Task Manager shows what's
running, but Process Explorer is much more informative.[1] It doesn't
require installation, or admin rights to run, and one can run it from a
USB flash drive. Its use will be logged, of course, but at least it
won't show up as an installed program.
Right click on processes of interest, and select Properties. The
Environment tab shows where logs etc might be found. The TCP/IP tab
shows network activity and remote IPs/hosts.
If there is stuff that requires admin rights to see, and there is some
private time, booting with a Linux LiveCD would be useful. makeuseof
recommends Hiren’s BootCD, The Ultimate Boot CD, and Knoppix.[2]
If there's no evidence of sophisticated efforts, it might be worth using
Portable VirtualBox[3,4] and a Ubuntu VM with LUKS.[5] However, using
Portable VirtualBox would likely require admin rights to install
drivers. It's fairly trivial to get admin rights in Windows.[6] And one
could reverse all changes after installing drivers needed for Portable
VirtualBox. But consequences of discovery might be painful.

Well, the idea has been kicked around for 20 years, and little has come
of it. Maybe that's because it's still unworkable. How are people going
to bid anonymously? Is Tor good enough for that? A viable AP market
would draw TLAs to Tor like dogs to shit. And they would cooperate.
Also, how would bidders pay anonymously when targets were killed? There
is no inherently anonymous payment system that's widely available. Maybe
anonymized Bitcoin, after a few mixes through Tor, would make the nut.
Or maybe creative carding. Maybe y'all reading this could manage it. But
what about the clueless masses who might be motivated to bid?
I don't know whether AP would take down governments. Hell, I'm not even
sure whether that would be prudent. But I am certain that many bidders
would go down, through cluelessness or system compromise.

Really? Let's say that there was a viable AP system. What would bids be
like for top US officials? There are maybe a couple billion people who
want them dead. Even at $1 each, that's a lot of money!
Also, consider the potential for collateral damage. Let's say that I'm
the captain of a Russian nuclear sub. The aggregate value of the US
Congress might hit $100 billion, no? So what might I do? First, kill my
crew, after making suitable arrangements. Then nuke Washington, and
collect my winnings. Maybe drop out for a few years in some deep part of
the Pacific. Then buy an island, and retire.

Anyway, CMU's attack did manage to compromise some onion services, most

Maybe they got blindsided by a zero day vulnerability. Or maybe they
just weren't paying enough attention.
But the SR2 connection came up in a comment, and there's no mea culpa
for the delay, just blame on CMU. It's stuff like this that fuels
conspiracy theories about Tor and the US military.
Also, your comment about port 80 makes no sense in this context. The CMU
attack deanonymized onion services, not users. And port 80 with onion
services is secure. It's non-encrypted traffic through exit nodes that's
insecure. There's no exit node when using onion services.

Well, JYA apparently did send them to him :) Apparently by accident.
Are you arguing that users could have found those logs?
I almost can't imagine that. Logs are normally in /var/log/ somewhere,
and I can't imagine making them searchable. And indeed, I can't imagine
how Cryptome archives would have included anything from /var/log/, even
after system restore from backups.
If Mike had uploaded them without full inspection, no problem. But, as I
understand the narrative, he knowingly uploaded them. Yes, he asked JYA
about it first. And yes, he posted to this list too. But in the end,
after getting no help, he went ahead and uploaded them.
And that, in my opinion, was unwarranted.
That is on JYA's tab, for sure ;)
As much as I hate waiting on the team reviewing Snowden's cache, I
generally agree on the importance of redaction to protect innocents.
Wikileaks redacts too. That's the lesson here, in my opinion.
True. We're all responsible for our own OPSEC.
But that's the thing. Logs should have been in /var/log/. And how would
the "NetSol total restore" have changed that?
I still don't get how logs would have ended up in archives. Maybe JYA
prepared a special set of archives for a collaborator. Maybe for someone
helping him to understand what had happened. And then maybe he forgot
about doing that. Hard to say.
I don't quite get what this is such a big deal. I've always assumed that
the Five Eyes etc intercept everything that they can. But there are so
many possible sources. Maybe GCHQ got the data from JYA's ISP. Or maybe
from their ISP. Or maybe from Cryptome archives. Or maybe from a bunch
of sources. Am I missing something here?
So what is the point?

That's true. But there are many militaries. And although much of their
technical allusion is over my head, what I do get makes sense.
I do consider you an ally, of a sort. And your perspective is valuable.
But your unremitting nihilism has been getting to me. And it smells like
sock to me.
In particular, I also have concerns and reservations about Tor. It's
true that the US military funded its development. And it's true that
they probably still use it.
But maybe think of it this way: we have military-grade anonymity. And in
any case, as far as I know, it's the best anonymity tool we've got.

De nada :) As I recall, it's also true for IPs, but I didn't find a
source. One could sumif the blockchain data by IP, and then get country
from MaxMind etc. There aren't too many Tor or VPN exits in China.
Right. I was taking "the chinese" more as the Chinese people. Or
whoever's buying Bitcoin, anyway. But regarding the thread overall, I do
believe that the Chinese government is divesting US bonds. They don't
want to fuck up the US economy by doing that quickly. But they also
don't want their investments to be devalued as the US prints money, ever
faster and faster.
Long term, as I understand it, they plan for yuan to replace dollar as
global fiat. They do own lots of gold, but I don't recall anything about
going gold standard. If you have cites, that would be cool.
It's my impression that Chinese people are generally very into saving.
But judging by the stock craziness, they aren't very sane about what
they invest in. Gold has always been popular. Bitcoins were a fad for a
while, but that's cooled off since the Mt Gox bubble collapsed in early
2014. The current ~70% share maybe just reflects population.

Me neither. Sometimes, though ...
Well, that's what the website says. I have no way to verify that ;)
Tor is open-source, and collaborative. Arguably, anyone with requisite
skills and resources can subvert it. But it is true that the Five Eyes
have the best resources for traffic analysis.
It's hard to say. Only idiots use tools with backdoors.
I don't believe that either Freenet or I2P are large enough to provide
strong anonymity. And both (along with most P2P systems) require that
nodes be discoverable. That complicates using them with VPNs and Tor.
It might be possible to run Freenet nodes as onion services. That works
well enough for Tahoe-LAFS. I've been meaning to test that. Also IPFS.
Well, adversaries can use malicious P2P nodes. It's true that Freenet is
about the same size as Tor ( vs
 But with Tor, what's
relevant is the number of possible circuits. With ~1700 entry guards,
~1000 exit relays and ~2300 non-entry/non-exit relays, about four
billion distinct circuits are possible.
Yes, it does. But neither it nor I2P provide anonymous access to the
general Internet.

First you create entangled electrons in two distant diamonds [separated
by 1.5 km in Hensen et al. (2015) and apparently 750 mi in the
Chinese-Austrian experiment described in the news article]. You do that
by exchanging photons, which travel at light-speed or less. Then you
measure the spins of those entangled electrons. And you find that the
spins are correlated in a way that's predicted by quantum mechanics, but
would be possible under classical mechanics (aka realism) only if the
entangled electrons could communicate at greater than light-speed.
So basically, they find that the classical model of reality is fucked.
Here's the abstract from Hensen et al. (2015)
The news article is full of bullshit.
As I understand it, they're just pushing the separation to 750 miles.
We're still a long way from transmitting useful data. And recall that
creating entanglement requires synchronization at light-speed or less.
In saying that it's dull, they're pointing out that what matters is the
math of quantum mechanics. It's just math. Equations. There's no mental
model, no story in words about how reality works. The interpretations
are just stories.

than 13.7 nanoseconds, to achieve that interference.
OK, so they've shown that reality (for lack of a better word) cannot be
both realistic (as in classical mechanics) and locally constrained (as
in inability of information to travel faster than light speed). But that
is just what quantum mechanics (a bunch of math) predicts.
That is, one of realism and locality must be wrong.
One interpretation is that spacial separation is just an illusion.

The fucking paper that I've cited. And more generally, all experiments
that reject the null hypothesis that the outcome of the CHSH game is 75%
or less.
Quantum mechanics is math. It makes predictions about reality that can
be tested. By experiments where stuff gets measured.
The problem is that some predictions of quantum mechanics, such as this
stuff about entanglement, 1) have been verified experimentally, but 2)
don't make obvious sense. That is, a wave function comprising two
entangled electrons can apparently collapse instantaneously, even though
the electrons are arbitrarily far apart. You could try to give up light
as a universal speed limit. But that creates other paradoxes.

I think that's the next bit that you didn't quote:
You can establish that both observers saw an entangled wave function
collapse, after the fact. But before the wave function collapses,
neither one can know what they'll see, and so they also can't know what
the other will see.

No, there's no "prediction". They can discover later that both sides saw
the expected spins. It's vaguely like you're flipping coins, and someone
on Mars is also flipping coins. And later you share notes, and find that
you both got more or less the same sequence of heads and tails. Not
perfect, but substantially better than chance. But neither side can
choose the order of heads and tails, so they can't create messages.
It's entangled electrons in diamonds, not photons. And you can only test
each pair of entangled electrons once. Because after that, they're no
longer entangled.
As I understand it, no information transfer is possible.

My hypothesis is that the lynch mob is making it about being male and
assertive (even if bisexual). Key members of the lynch mob are trans. Do
you deny that? And they seem to cut each other slack. Right?
For sure, that's generally true for being trans. But I'm talking about

twice. And that they arrested him at least once. And that he bailed

Maybe some TLA pwned his Twitter account, and worked with the police to
have him harassed and murdered. Or maybe he just had a bad night, too

interactions with the police. And then suicided by cop.

Well, Juan basically tells them to use nothing. Or at least, I haven't
managed to elicit any substantive recommendations. So what the fuck?
Yes, the Tor Project is bullshitting people, and that's evil.
I'm not about positive thinking, but rather about working with what's
available. And that includes Tor, even if it's primarily a tool of
fascist oppression. The Colt M1911A1 is one of my favorite weapons, for
example. Even though it was built for the US military.

As I said, your reading comprehension sucks. Or you're just twisting

It works for many people.
So you keep saying.
Yes, but statements about anonymity systems generally aren't limited to
No, I don't care about the "real price of the system". Why should I?
And, as I said before, people that you hate would be using any effective
anonymity system. So you might as well get over it.

It's more about ideological purity than perfection, I think. He says
that he _uses nothing_.
I gather that he's calling for a boycott of Tor, based on its origin,
design, and funding. But it's not as clear as, for example, boycotts of
South Africa or Israel. Many years ago, I recall getting shit from
Jewish friends for driving a VW Bug. Designed by Nazis! But this was
decades after WWII. So how were Nazis still relevant?

De gustibus non disputandem ;)
I did no such thing.
You're forgetting the "substantially" bit. Tor does reduce state power,
now, for many people. Maybe not overall, on a net basis, given how state
fascists use it. By "substantially", I mean that anonymity systems might
eventually destroy states by undermining taxation. As in Stephenson's
_Snow Crash_ or MacArdry's _Last Trumpet Project_.
They don't yet work substantially, fucktard ;)
The best _right now_ does not mean the best ever. WTF.
It's not "OK". It's what's so. The Pentagon will use any anonymity
system to fuck people.
He's not so rabid about not using Tor, I think.

I find it hard to imagine how anarchist societies could develop in our
currently state-dominated world. Anarchist societies have survived
through isolation, and some still do. But how does that work in places
under active state contention?
Also, anarchy seems to work best when everyone is more-or-less equally
powerful. Everyone has the same weapons, for example. In science
fiction, anarchist societies typically depend on some new technology
that eliminates states' power monopoly. Maybe it'll be the Singularity.
Yes. But Russia has been exporting ethnic Russians to Crimea for
centuries. And for other ethnic groups, voting against joining Russia
would have indeed been voting for civil war, on the minority side. You
can't vote your conscience when there's a gun to your head.
That's just another gang, the one that NATO helped build. And sure, they
also have grievances going back centuries.
Look, Russian governments have always needed an ocean port that's not

I guess. But damn, an up-to-date English version makes more sense to me.
My current working hypothesis is that Tor is not broken/breakable by
design. But I've become increasingly concerned by the continuing
emphasis on Tor browser (easy to install but easily compromised) and
omission of Whonix (harder to install but much harder to compromise). It
is arguable that ease of use trumps strong protection, in that there's
greater net benefit. But less charitably, maybe the need for numerous
users to hide among trumps everything else.

Well, say "technically inexperienced" if you like. In my world, we
call that "clueless". I'm more or less clueless in many areas, and am
not ashamed to admit it.
Well, given what we know of TLA capabilities, what Tor Project says at
 is tantamount to false advertising:
Maybe so against local adversaries. But clearly not against global
adversaries. Cynical folk note that so far, the US and its allies are
the only known global adversary. And claim that this is self-serving
It for sure hasn't stopped FBI, with their honeypots that drop
malware. And I doubt that it stops NSA/GCHQ. But Tor Project just
postures about "bad FBI". They don't give naive users, who may be at
risk, even a brief heads up about proxy leakage, and how to prevent it.
Two or three years ago, even after the Freedom Hosting debacle, I was
willing to cut Tor Project some slack. But after the PlayPen attack,
it's becoming harder to escape the conclusion that Tor Project either
doesn't want to mitigate this risk, or doesn't have the contractual
freedom to do so.
Fair enough :)
It's my general impression that Whonix project has been actively
rebuffed. But I have no inside knowledge.
Yes, that does seem to be the case. But asking hasn't gotten me
anywhere. Maybe some fly on the wall will dump some evidence ;)
I don't disagree that they're different issues. My point is that
warning users about proxy bypass takes but a few words on a website,
and maybe a link. And given that it's such an easy fix, I suspect that
Tor Project either doesn't want to admit the risk so clearly, or is
somehow being prevented from doing so.
It's been at least five years! The relay early bug got fixed in
months. Maybe devs are working on some integrated firewall or
whatever. That would be cool. But Whonix isn't vulnerable, has been
available for years, and gets no love. And it's not just Whonix. Other
approaches that separate tor process and userland have also been
largely ignored.
Which VPNs have received NSLs?
Anyway, I don't assume that a particular VPN operator can be trusted
any more than a particular Tor relay operator can. Just as Tor uses
three-relay circuits, I recommend using nested VPN chains, with at
least three different VPNs, operating in different jurisdictions.
Some useful links:

I'd say "meta" rather than "sideways", but hey ;)
Well, Whonix uses stock Tor browser, with a tweak to keep it from
launching its own local tor process. It also enforces stream
separation for other apps. But the key thing here is that it prevents
proxy bypass.
Yes, they are for sure not that line. So why not acknowledge that?
Maybe key funders have said no to that.
Right. For most, Tor browser on Windows. Pwnage waiting to happen.
But why does Tor Project care about captured audience dependency?
People using Whonix, like people using Tails, are still using Tor. And
still using stock Tor browser.
Maybe goals of key funders are driving this. Deliver lots of Tor
relays and users to hide our agents. But make sure that users can't
hide from our TLAs. That's what language in Graham's appropriations
bill says. Maybe that's been the backroom deal for years, and Tor
Project has been pushing back. One does get that sense from the leaked
IRC logs.
I doubt that they hire anons :(
But damn, I'd do it for free, if they let me :)

He's not my friend, Juan. He works for the fucking US Navy, after all.
But I do respect him. Think about it. He and his friends got US military
funding for a project that provided deniable and secure communication,
but only by making it public, for use by both funders and their enemies.
It might be that this vulnerability was crucial for selling it to US
military. But that's distinguishable from the argument that it's
intentionally designed to be vulnerable. There's also the fact that
nobody has come up with anything practical that's not vulnerable to
global adversaries. So it seems unlikely that he had such a design that
he put aside as unsellable.

If Tor were actually secure, I could accept that US government uses it
for evil. It's the same argument that we make about encryption
generally. Systems with backdoors can't be secure. And you can't keep
anyone from using anonymity systems without backdoors.
As I understand Juan's position, that wouldn't work for him.

Have you updated it to account for subverted VPN providers?
This gets at the trust issue:
That comes pretty close, I think. NSLs are really irrelevant in risk
assessment. Because NSL or not, you have no way to know who you can
trust. So you can't trust anyone.
Say what you will, this is misleading:

What's your evidence for that? I doubt that it's technical, from what
you've shared. So it sounds like just an assumption.
That's the fallacy about backdoors ;)
So are you arguing that well-designed backdoors are OK? Or are you just
arguing that US military are dumb enough to think so. That they're so
confident about their superior capabilities?
Let's assume, hypothetically, that Tor is secure for everyone. And let's
acknowledge that US military uses it for evil.
If that were so, would you use and recommend Tor?
Or would you reject it, because it's used for evil?

I didn't say that there was anything altruistic or humanitarian about
it. And yes, they did what they had to do.
Yes, they do. All Tor users do, actually.
Maybe it does, and maybe it doesn't. I can't imagine how you know. I do
agree that it's prudent to be suspicious. But no better alternatives
have been implemented. So the best option that I see is layering stuff.
Route Tor through nested VPNs. Route Mixmaster, Pond, Bitmessage, etc
through Tor. Encrypt private stuff with GnuPG.
Maybe so.

What you say is possible. But none of us actually know how bad it is.
Except, of course, for those with privileged information about US
military capabilities ;)
Tor Project says:
You warn people not to use Tor, because it's useless against US
military. And as I recall, you also reject Tor on moral grounds, because
US military uses it for evil.
I consider both positions to be irresponsible. Conning people into using
Tor recklessly, with insecure setups, is at best irresponsible. If the
goal is cover traffic for US military, it's malicious.
But frightening people from using Tor, when there are no viable
alternatives, is also at best irresponsible. Even if Tor is more or less
useless against US military, it still protects users against other
adversaries. And arguably it even protects most users from US military,
if only because they're not important enough to focus on.
Putting it in caps doesn't make it right :)
I disagree about backdoors generally.
But specifically about vulnerability of Tor to global adversaries, you
may be right. But also you may be wrong.
Actually, they pretty much invented it ;)
I wonder if they have AIs yet. That would be amazing!
Not at all, Juan :)

Tor is open source, so trusting software doesn't depend entirely on
trusting coders.
It's based on intercepts _and_ "fancy math and number crunching".
You are very suspicious ;)

And that he gets off on being clever. So I consider it possible that he

But anyway, it's pointless to argue about people's motivations. What we
have now is Tor. Do we ignore it, or make the best of it?
I say that it's better than nothing. You disagree. So it goes.
Whoever controls Tor Project is misrepresenting it. We agree on that.

Your claims go far beyond any evidence that I've seen.
That's a fair argument. But again, you work with what you have.
We all use knives, which military use to kill. One of my favorites is an
old German gravity knife, used by paratroopers. It's very convenient for
one-handed use.
If he had done it without Tor, he would have been in jail a lot sooner!
It is likely that he pushed his luck too far using Tor.
Nested VPN chains are also vulnerable to global adversaries. It may be
that all low-latency anonymity systems that can scale to many users are
vulnerable to global adversaries.
Yes, we do keep coming back to the same circular discussion, don't we?
I'm concerned that Tor is pwned by US military, but I'm not convinced
that rejecting it entirely is the best course.
That's not really a backdoor. You argue that Tor is vulnerable to global
adversaries, and was designed that way. But it's not just Tor. It seems
that all low-latency anonymity systems that scale to numerous users are
vulnerable to global adversaries.
I'm just saying that you don't know for sure. You may think that you do.
But there's just too much uncertainty. You said as much in another
thread. The issue is what to do when there's uncertainty. We disagree.
Pretty much ;) At least, initial development of computers was mainly
driven by military.
I was pointing to the difficulty of interpreting global intercepts.
Yes. I thought that was clear.
OK, thanks, that's what I thought.
More than damaged, I want to see governments gone.
Sure they would. Nuclear weapons, for example. Or biological warfare,
which is now pretty much doable at home. Or personal computers and the

vulnerabilities, and links to resources for addressing them.
It ain't perfect, but it's better than nothing.
Not that simple. Maybe not "fancy", but there's a *lot* of data. And
when you look for correlation at such scales, false positives are a
*huge* problem.
I don't trust anyone :)
They did succeed in taking down the Soviet Union, by forcing it to
bankrupt itself and disappoint its population. But I think that they've
consistently fucked up in the Middle East. Generally, they focus too
much on short-term objectives, and set themselves up for eventual
failure. They count too much on brute force.
Short term, it's doing OK. Long term, probably not so good.

I tested 29 Windows VPN clients for DNS, IPv4 and IPv6 Leaks. Six
(AirVPN, FrootVPN, IVPN, Mullvad, Perfect Privacy and SlickVPN)
performed perfectly. Three others (CyberGhost, oVPN.to and
SecureVPN.to) hit VPN-specified nameservers directly while
reconnecting after uplink interruption. But that's not a huge issue,
in that they didn't hit other nameservers. The other 20 Windows VPN
clients failed in various ways. Over half leaked IPv6 packets whenever
the machine was connected to the Internet. After uplink interruption,
some failed to reconnect automatically, and some leaked IPv4 packets.

Thanks. I've been thinking about how to test harder. I did ICMP ping
8.8.8.8 and wget google.com, but not other packet types.
I'll take a closer look at the clients. In many cases, it was just
stock OpenVPN, or maybe with a wrapper.
Good point. I'll tweak that language.
Yes, it's why doing your own leak prevention is best. Unless the VPN
provides its own IPv6 address, disable IPv6 everywhere you can, and
block it with firewall rules. Use firewall rules to allow connections
on physical interface only to VPN server. Restrict everything else to
VPN tunnel. And make sure that you're using VPN-assigned DNS server(s)
through VPN tunnel.
But the six totally leak-free Windows VPN clients do that. Indeed,
FrootVPN and Perfect Privacy provide their own IPv6 addresses. And
FrootVPN is leak-free using stock OpenVPN, doing just server-side.
Interesting. VPN SOCKS5 port.

What do you use for privacy and/or "anonymity"?
Why do you use the Internet? It's arguably just as pwned as Tor is.

Yes, VPNs will provide as much privacy as Tor does for purely local
adversaries. But if your adversary can get logs from the VPN server, or
the hosting provider, you're screwed. With Tor, such adversaries would
need to get logs from at least two of the three relays in circuits. And
circuits change frequently, so that means lots of relays.
And sure, you can nest VPNs. So a nested chain of three VPNs arguably
does as much as a Tor circuit. But it's static. Or at least, I haven't
figured out how to automate switching. And there's also the matter of
paying for a bunch of VPNs.
Anyway, I hedge my bets by accessing Tor through nested VPNs.
Right. I2P also runs on Java.
Well, that's cool, if it works for you. Doesn't work for me, however.
You have a point. But far too many people do seem to believe that
they're anonymous on the Internet.

At a minimum, I recommend hitting Tor through at least one VPN. Or
better, nested chains of at least three VPNs. To prevent leaks, I
recommend using pfSense VMs as VPN gateways, and Whonix VMs for Tor.
One can also use VPS running SSH onion services for old-school host
chaining. Each VPS connects through a VPN, so Tor can't detect that
you're chaining circuits. See

Yes, it's not so easy. And even with help from their national
government, it would take a while. And even VPNs that log can't retain
logs forever, so you might get lucky.
True. But ISPs normally aren't a treat. It's who's pushing their
buttons. Whether it's the MPAA or Los Zetas.
Yes. But there are many mid-size adversaries. And you could also say
that Tor works against all but the global adversaries. Plus clever ones
that can exploit bugs.
True. But not me.
I have no clue what percentage of Tor code has been funded by the US
government. There are lots of volunteers, after all.
But I agree that Tor has rather dominated the space for "anonymity
systems". Every few years, I see a paper about something new, but they
never seem to go anywhere. So yes, there is a problem. But I don't think
that state subsidy is directly at fault.
Interesting. But I still don't like I2P, because decent performance
depends on being a relay, with a public IP address and open port. One
can do it with VPNs and port forwarding. But still.
I get that. And I suspect that you're in a friendlier environment.
Many Tor users have been screwed by thinking that they were "anonymous".
But still, many more would have been screwed if they had done whatever
they were doing without any protection. Maybe some of them, such as the
ones pwned by CMU, would have been better off using VPNs. That's rather
ironic, considering how much abuse Tor supporters have heaped on VPNs.
But overall, I think that Tor has done much good.

For sure. But also for online drug dealers. There have been a few
spectacular failures, certainly. And the security model of having
illegal stuff mailed to meatspace addresses is laughable. But it has
clearly increased availability, especially for niche substances like DMT
and analogues. Quality too, I suspect.
For me, that's a good. No question.
More generally, Tor has allowed many to evade state control. Some of
them deserve to die, in my opinion. But the important point is that Tor
has overall reduced state power.
Is that not a good thing, juan?
It's true that Tor has allowed the CIA to act more freely in Ukraine,
Syria, Iran, etc. But that, like freedom for pedophiles, is just a cost
of usable "anonymity systems" (or whatever you want to call them).

Ulbricht went down because associates fucked up, got busted, and
cooperated with investigators. Also, it seems that his OPSEC sucked.
It's not clear how Freedom Hosting got compromised. I don't believe that
it was a Tor exploit. And it was call-home malware that pwned users.
Which only affected idiots using Tor browser in Windows.
Agora owners never said exactly what flaws in Tor concerned them, as I
recall. And there are workarounds. Bigger problems, I think, are moving
large amounts of money anonymously, and explaining income.
I have no clue. But for some demographics, I bet that it's huge. Have
you ever tried to find DMT? I love DMT :)
It's the best that's available, I believe.
Perfection is the enemy of workability :)
And if you know of something better, please do recommend it.
It's not what I want, but it's what I'll accept.
Consider this thought experiment. Let's say that some cypherpunk, with
unimpeachable anarchist credentials, creates an anonymity system. One
that's not vulnerable to local adversaries or global adversaries. One,
perhaps, that uses covert channels, so ISPs can't even detect that it's
being used. Then they release the source, and fun begins.
So who would use it? I'm guessing that everyone who uses Tor, I2P, etc,
etc would use it. And so we'd be back to where we are now with Tor, with
just the exception that the new system isn't vulnerable to global
How would you keep statist criminals from using it?
There's still the criticism that Tor is intentionally vulnerable to
global adversaries. Maybe it was at first, by design. But it's an
open-source project. You'd need to argue that contributions which
increased resistance to global adversaries have been rejected or
discouraged. Is there evidence for that?
By providing freedom and privacy for state subjects.
Also, see the above thought experiment. It doesn't matter whose project
it is. The same people would end up using it.
Always :) Mostly caffeine, though. Modafinil too :)
It's not a zero-sum game.
As much as I sympathize for victims of criminal states, I believe that
anonymity systems are essential for protecting privacy and freedom. I
also believe that they may eventually reduce state power substantially.
Although that's seeming more and more like a dream.
Maybe not, but pedophiles are the goto example. Government criminals
fuck people at much larger scales, for sure. Maybe the crypter assholes
are a better example, but that's still small-scale.

Yes, far more papers than implementations. Once you have something that
works well enough, or that people are at least so convinced, new ideas
don't attract much interest. But maybe that's changing now.
Why did Tor go with circuit switching? Was it mostly about efficiency?
We have a very different Internet now. Also, is it easier to bury packet
switching in chaff?
Which ones, in particular?
With global active adversaries, which can observe and modify packets on
every public network, it's hard to imagine how substantive [anonymity |
unlinkability | deniability | privacy] is possible. Sure, every node
might send traffic that's not provably nonrandom to every other node at
constant rate. But it's still obvious that you're up to something. And
once they tweak your traffic, they can look at what other nodes start
behaving differently. So I come back to the need for covert channels.
Maybe so. But many of them tend to keep to themselves ;)

Just for fun, but maybe useful:

You too can chain multiple onion SSH logins, isolated by intervening

hogs relays, I admit. But at least, there are no exit nodes involved.
OpenVPN Onion VPS for Evading Discrimination Against Tor
You look like typical VPN users. They get banned too. But you can

The plastic film from reflective (but not translucent) antistatic bags
works well. You can use aluminum tape for sealing seams. But my favorite
is nickel/silver-plated nylon fabric. It's durable, and drapes well. You
can make clothing from it. Or curtains.

Setting up Pond servers isn't hard. A friend is working on a how-to.
