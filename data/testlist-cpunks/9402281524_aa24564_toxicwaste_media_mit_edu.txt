But is there ever going to be a future version of PGP?  Even if there
was, it would probably be ViaCrypt and we wouldn't even be able to see
the source :(  I don't mind if Phil makes some money (he deserves a
reward for what he did!) but it's a shame PGP won't be the open system
that it was before.  Maybe some netters would like to get together and
work on it to keep the free spirit of PGP alive...
