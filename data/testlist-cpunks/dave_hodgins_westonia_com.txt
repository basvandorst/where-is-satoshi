KJ> Subject: Re: unsubscrive
  I didn't keep the article, but there was a fairly recent post to
the risks digest that mentioned that someone somewhere has set up an
automated address grabber/spoofer of subscribe messages for several
high volume mailing lists.  This assumption was based on the large
number of subscribers being added to the list, who were then complaining
that they had never asked to be added to the list.
  Since the cypherpunks list is a rather high volume list, it shouldn't
be surprising that it may become a tool for annoying people unfamiliar
with mailing lists.
  Regards, Dave Hodgins.
  P.S.  To unsubscribe from the cypherpunks mailing list, send a message
addressed to majordomo at toad.com   with
unsubscribe cypherpunks
  in the body of the message.  the subject is ignored.

  As a lurker (I've only sent 4 messages to the list in the last 3 years),
I agree completely with Adam Back's post.
  I'd also like to point out, that I rarely read all of the messages, and
tend to select which messages to read, based on the subject.  Because of
this, I missed the message announcing that the moderation had started, and that there was a new, unedited list.  I didn't realize the moderation
had started, until I noticed the lack of autobot insults, and then looked
at some of the messages from the moderation thread.
  I get the list via email, through a pcboard bbs, mixed in with all of
my personal email.  I wrote a program, to separate everything from the
list into separate folder.  Switching over to the unedited list, will
require a bit more for me, then just unsubscribe/subscribe.
  I'll wait and see if the moderation continues on the main list.  If it
does, I'll go through the bother of switching to the unedited list.
  Regards, Dave Hodgins.
