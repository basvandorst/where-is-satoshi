I know for sure that Soviet KGB did a lot of work in graphology and kept samples of print of every typewriter there was in the country.
   It might be easy to write a program that would randomly modify spacing,
indentations, punctuation styles, spelling, replace words with random
synonyms, reorder words in phrases, etc.  It can eliminate most of the
clues, excluding the concepts.
You will have to compromise between the accuracy of the message and its
privacy protection, but it is still something...

I am grateful to both people who sent me the mail I lost;
I don't think I have a right to disclose their identity  ;-)
but I am grateful to them anyway, as well as to all those who
might want to send it to me later - please don't - too bad I'll
never know your names... Thanks anyway!
BTW, I missed the point when people started using prefixes in message
titles; was there an 'official' suggestion for it?

What about encoding a message by chnging spacing between the words?
It is surely not the most compact method, but one might be able to transmit
a pretty long message hidden in the text of "Alice in Wonderland" that
would still be neatly formatted and *word-to-word* indistinguishable from
the original.
 Alex.
