@_subject: Is it true that PGP 5.X is not secure? 
My humble knowledge does not permit my answering your question.
However, I suppose your question is problematical. It is difficult
to define security, or more precisely a scientifcally rigorous
measure of security. I don't think that it is sensible to talk about absolute security without reference to a context (environment). In my view there is no 'perfect' encryption system in the practical
world. If by 'not secure' you meant something that malicious persons have secretely manipulated to cause you damage, then I also don't know but I guess that to be highly unlikely, given the good historical record of PGP. M. K. Shen
