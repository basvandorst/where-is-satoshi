References: but AOL being the only access provider in town just means that you buy a
TCP/IP feed off of them, ie use them as your PPP connection.
You then run your mail off a.n.other service provider. AOL has great
connectivity worldwide - all the people I know that use AOL just use it for
IP not mail...
