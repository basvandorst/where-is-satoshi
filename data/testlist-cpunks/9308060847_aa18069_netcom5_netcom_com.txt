My apologies - I guess I wasn't clear.  Waht I meant was, does she honestly
think that people *won't* do what I suggested, just because there are laws
forbidding it?  If she does, she is surely living in a dreamworld.
Not to mention the infamous 'netphone' :)
At the risk of stating the obvious:
I think 'could' can very probably be changed to '*will*'.  So, how are
they going to keep '"unbreakable codes' out of the hands of criminals and
terrorists'?  Laws are obeyed by the 99% of society who are law-abiding
(generally speaking, that is), yet laws are made targeting the 1% of the
population who couldn't care less.
Yes, but remember, most hams are law-abiding, since a ham radio license
is not a right.
Of course it is!  But that won't stop anyone but the DAvid Sternlights of the
world from using crypto.  Can't the folks in DC plainly *see* that??
Time to go to bed - I've got an 11 AM interview.  Anyone know of any sysadmin
contracts out there?? :)
