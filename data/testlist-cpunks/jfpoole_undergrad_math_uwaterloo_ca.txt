@_subject: ASM vs portable code [WAS: Re: Java DES breaker?] 
This discussion sounds similar to the "C vs. Assembler" thread that's been
raging on comp.lang.c for the past couple of months. The general consensus
seems to be that on an x86 processor, using C for most of your program and
using assembler sparingly is the best way to go. Plus, most compilers will
produce code that runs about 1.2 - 1.5 times slower than your average
assembler code. You mileage, of course, will vary.
