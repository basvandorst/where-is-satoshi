   (recently deceased) FreeS/WAN project have started a [1]new company to
   develop and support the successor of the Linux IPsec code under the
   name of [2]Openswan in a "Cygnus style" business model. They
   [3]announced the new version at CeBIT which fully supports the new
   Linux 2.6 native IPsec stack. According to the [4]Openswan website, it
   was started 'by a few of the developers who were growing frustrated
   with the politics surrounding the FreeS/WAN project.' There is a
   [5]FAQ that explains how the various parts of IPsec on Linux work
   together. I guess that means US citizens can finally submit patches,
   and that distributions like RedHat/Fedora can now include it in their
   distribution. FreeS/WAN has always had the most features and most the
   most user-friendly configuration. It is good to see that will
   continue. And their [6]mailing list finally seems to refuse spam too."
