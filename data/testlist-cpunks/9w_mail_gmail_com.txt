I can't answer to all your concerns separately as it seems you have got one very big problem: you are into computers, but you have trouble compiling - merely compiling - programs for OpenBSD.
You are in the same boat of Karpeles and Ulbricht, they also were barely able to code some interpreted language and they were overwhelmed by the intricacies of the systems they were building. Until they finally brought disaster for themselves and everyone that depended on them.
In order to grasp the seriousness of things, you gotta start with something simpler which doesn't require so many security skills, like games. Then you build up your knowledge until one day you can make your own exchange.
But until that point, it is irresponsible to try as you have well noticed.
Regarding the rest of your concerns, everything can be dealt with properly, but it takes years of learning. There's a reason computer security professionals are amongst the most well paid employees which big corporations and rich governments only can hire.
