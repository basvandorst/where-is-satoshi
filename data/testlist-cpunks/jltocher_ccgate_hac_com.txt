@_subject: 2048 bit key generation with 2.6.2 
I changed my system date (Ho! Ho! Ho!) in order to test the generation of      2048 bit keys. Key view shows the key as having 2047 bits. Can someone tell      me what's goin' on? Please reply by E-Mail; I'm currently not on the list      because of the volume.
     Regards,
     John

From Edupage:
     REPLACEMENT FOR CLIPPER
     AT&T and VLSI Technology Inc. will collaborate to develop microchips      that use a triple-strength version of DES (data encryption standard),      which previously had been rejected by the National Security Agency.      VLSI is the designated contractor to make the government-favored      Clipper chips, but this latest announcement reveals their doubts over      whether there's a market for the Clipper. "These companies have      basically made the determination that Clipper is dead and there's      going to be the proliferation of encryption anyway, so they might as      well take advantage of it," says one observer, who predicts the market      for such technology "could reach hundreds of millions" of dollars in      annual sales by the end of the decade.

     THE NEW ETHOS OF THE NET
     A professor at St. Cloud University in Minnesota calls for overhauling      business school curricula to stress ethical concerns in the electronic      age the same way they stress finance or economic theory. The end      result? "Information systems will be protected because most people      will no longer be willing to purposefully contaminate a program or      network; they will protect others' confidentiality, privacy, and      copyright as they protect their own; they will refuse to plagiarize,      fabricate, and perpetrate other types of fraud; and they will not      tolerate such activities in others." The alternative is bleak: "...We      will degenerate into secretive, encrypted, overly protective      information hoarders, unwilling to share and disseminate knowledge --      except for profit." (Information Week 2/6/95 p.64)      But, how do you really feel...

From Edupage:
     TO BUNDLE OR NOT TO BUNDLE? THAT IS THE MICROSOFT QUESTION      One of the fears Microsoft rivals have is that Microsoft will build      directly into the Windows operating system various applications      software packages (such as encryption for financial processing over      the Internet), because customers would be reluctant to pay for      products that do more-or-less the same thing as an installed product      that they get "for free." Although it's unlikely that the government      would consider breaking Microsoft up into separate companies, it is      conceivable that it could force Microsoft to limit what it includes      with its operating systems.

     ONLINE SPYING
     While you're connected to your favorite Web page, it's also connected      to you, and could be copying all sorts of information off your hard      drive, say industry experts. In fact, it happened last year when      Central Point Software used registration software developed by      Pipeline Communications, and inadvertently also gathered descriptions      of the users' systems -- the type of microprocessor, the version of      DOS and Windows, the type of display and mouse, and the amount of free      space available on the hard drive. Customers squawked, and Central      Point had Pipeline change the software. However, Pipeline reports that      at least one of its clients is using the scanning feature now -- but      only after getting the owner's permission. The lesson? "If you can't      trust it, don't connect to it." (Forbes 2/13/95 p.186)
