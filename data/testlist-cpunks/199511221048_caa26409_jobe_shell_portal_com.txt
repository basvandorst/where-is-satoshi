What I'm trying to say is that if someome posts from watson.ibm.com,
and IF they are talking about OS/2, we will not accept that they are
not speaking independantly of the knowledge they have garnered from
It just doesn't work that way.
In the same way, someone who writes from Netscape.com or AT&T, or Sun
and tries to disclaim that they are speaking for the company, when
they step out as an employee of a company is deluding themselves.
When in the press have you seen a reporter claim as a source, an
"unnamed Senator"?
Alice de 'nonymous ...
                                  ...just another one of those...

P.P.S.  I just sent email to Steve Bellovin from AT&T.  I thought I'd         settle the question once and for all, as to whether he IS         reading this mailing list or not.
