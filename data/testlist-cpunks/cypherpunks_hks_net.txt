Not exactly;  that's how the thought train began, but something that was
just for circumventing the rule would have a slightly different solution:
generate a new key for each post, sign with the key, and throw it away
(so that no information would be contained in the signature).  The
signatures from the current system does contain some information.
I might yet still implement something that does the above: at this point,
it's pretty trivial, aside from hacking PGP to generate a key with a smaller
than 384-bit modulus (to conserve computrons).
As an aside, this is my general approach to things: I'll start off in
a particular direction and then vary it as I think of new things.  I
only mention it here because I often state that I'm going to do something
and then the result is somewhat different than my original summary. I've done this a couple times here, and I'm hoping that explaining this
will make me appear, well, less flakey.
