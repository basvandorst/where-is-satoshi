@_subject: Espionage-enabled Lotus notes. 
I've come up with a new term to describe the type of 'improved' security
in the new International edition of Lotus Notes:
It's specifically built for export, and has a backdoor to enable USG agents
to read the messages more easily. From the viewpoint of a foreign purchaser,
'espionage-enabled' seems an appropriate term.
If we spread this term sufficiently, we may be able to discourage the widespread adoption of this half-measure, and increase the pressure for
good, unencumbered crypto.
speaking only for myself,
