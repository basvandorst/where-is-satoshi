Cryptography, in particular public-key cryptography, has emerged in the
las 20 years as an important discipline that is not only the subject of
enormous amount of research, but provides the foundation for information
security in many applications.  Standards are emerging to meet the
for cryptographic protection in most areas of data communications.
key cryptographic techniques are now in widespread use in industry, especially in the financial services industry, in the public sector, and
individuals for their personal privacy, such as in electronic mail.
This Handbook will serve as a valuable reference for the novice as well as
the expert who needs a wider scope of coverage within the aread of
cryptography.  It is a necessary and timely guide for professionals who
practice the art of cryptography.
The _Handbook_of_Applied_Cryptography_ provides a treatment that is multifunctional:
* It serves as an introduction to the more practical aspects of
  both conventional and public-key cryptography
* It is a valuable source of the latest techniques and algorithms
  for the serious practitioner
* It provides an integrated treatment of the field, whil still
  presenting each major topic as a self-contained unit
* It provides a mathematical treatment to accompany   practical discussions
* It contains enough abstractoin to be a valuable reference for
  theoreticians while containing enough detail to actually allow
  implementation of the algorithms discussed
This is the definitive cryptography reference that novice as well as
developers, designers, researchers, engineers, computer scientists, and
mathematicials alike will find indispensable.
