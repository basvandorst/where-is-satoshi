@_subject: Linking = Showing = Transferring? 
Here's my question, and a thought to ponder: If it is/becomes illegal to
have links on a homepage to pornography because it is ruled as the same as
having the pornography there; then can you have links to pages with links
(the same as having it) to pornography? This repeats, so would it be legal
to links at all?

@_subject: CyberAngels 
not sure if this is the right place.
I agree with allen, about the issues of 'nym. But looking at other aspects
of these cyberangels I'm unsure how to feel. On one hand they seem resonable,
protecting only the children. "Acts bewteen consenting adults are okay" say they. But the protect the children was what the CDA hid under.

@_subject: FL Demonstrates Fatal Flaw in Logins 
Sorry to all, but I'm not seeing what would appear to be obvious.
There seems to be a lot of talk about FV "new program" that undermines
security of computer login/credit cards over the net and such like that. I
don't know about you guys, but I wrote stuff like that in sixth grade on
the old apple IIe. It's pretty simple to write a programs that attaches
itself to the keyboard driver and logs the text types, or only logs certain
parts, what is the large deal? As it applies to internet security, I don't
see how it can make a difference. It must be run from the local computer,
at system level. If I'm on my home computer, I know what's running, and
feel safe that a loging program isn't amung them. What would enable a
remote site to pick up my typings.
However, I don't know much about Java, would it be possible to make such an
applet with Java?

@_subject: secure WWW on UNsecure servers 
It seems like it could be done by writing a plug-in that passed the
encrypted page to pgp (or had it internally) and used that to decrypt it.
The plug-in could store  the pass-phrase locally and clear when the user
It *might* also be possible to do this with java. I don't know enough java
to say for sure, but couldn't you build an interface that took the
encrypted data passed it though whatever and then displayed it on the local
screen. The applet could produce a viewer with a 'sigoff' button telling
the applet to forget the pass-phrase. Comments?
