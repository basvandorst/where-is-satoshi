Reply-To: then hopefully this post is a paroxysm of joy for you JP! ;) :
the deduction of the e-gold spend fee is not included in velocity the distribution of any incentive payments per
is not included in velocity numbers. the *only* thing counting as a in "e-metal spends" is an e-metal spend (aka payment) from one account another initiated by a user doing one of:
a) manually signing into his account and performing a "Spend"
b) checking out at a merchant using e-gold SCI
c) using phone access to make a spend
d) using a program and the e-gold Automation Interface to make a spend
those velocity numbers are totals for the amounts users are spending
to other users. they do not include any other thing like fees, storage
charges, or incentive payments.
possibly the most informative, accurate and timely economic statistics
on earth - possibly the universe!! ;)
