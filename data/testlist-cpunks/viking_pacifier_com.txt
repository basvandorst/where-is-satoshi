The interesting thing about PGP is that any incriminating cypher text one
might have on his or her hard disk would, most likely, be in someone else's
public key.  So, even if they had your secret key the only thing that could
be uncovered would be cyphertext that someone else had written to you.
Granted, that this could be incriminating but, then again, not necessarily.
I'm sure that for the purposes of conducting a criminal investigation, your
own cyphertext would be far more incriminating than someone else's. (The
above is only true unless you use the single key encryption option offered
for personal files in which case your files would be readable.) What one should be more concerned with is sloppy handling of plain text files
used prior to encryption.  A good example of that is if you're using Windows
based applications such as MS Winword.  It has an auto-store function that
generates a "Temp" file.  Such files aren't wiped in the same fashion that PGP
uses when it wipes a text file prior to encryption.
I think that the paramount thing to consider is if you have something to
hide then it is best to store it is inside your head.  Any computer based
storage system is bound to have certain limitations that may be bridged by a
determined government agency.  The other alternative is to ensure that
potentially incriminating files be purged regularly to avoid such potential
