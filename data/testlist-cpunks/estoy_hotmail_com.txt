@_subject: How to eliminate liability? 
This is just an idea I thought I would throw out and see what happens.  There has been considerable discussion recently about datahavens, how no one physical location in meatspace is safe, and how there is no single place on earth that a datahaven could exist that would accept all kinds of information.
Well, what about spreading the information out?  Something simple like doing a matrix rotation on the scrambled data in 8 byte blocks and splice it by bit to split the data up, add ECC (error correction code) to it, and spread it to several servers.  This way no one server has all the information necessary to recreate the "offending" information and if one server gets "hit" (killed), the information can still be regenerated from the the information and ECC from the other servers.
The bit splitting I'm talking about would go something like this.  The data would be set up in clusters of eight bytes and then these eight bytes would be rotated, error correction applied, divided byte by byte to separate queues (for separate destinations), resequenced to include the ECC overhead, and sent on it's merry way.
Original encrypted information:
Cluster A               Cluster B...
Byte 1: 01001011
Byte 2: 10101110
Byte 3: 10010110
Byte 4: 10110111
Byte 5: 01011100
Byte 6: 10111011
Byte 7: 10001101
Byte 8: 00110110
After the matrix rotate:
Cluster A               Cluster B...
Byte 1: 01110110
Byte 2: 10001000
Byte 3: 01010101
Byte 4: 00111101
Byte 5: 11001110
Byte 6: 01111011
Byte 7: 11110101
Byte 8: 10010110
Add ECC:
Cluster A               Cluster B...
Byte 1:   01110110 1
Byte 2:   10001000 0
Byte 3:   01010101 0
Byte 4:   00111101 1
Byte 5:   11001110 1
Byte 6:   01111011 0
Byte 7:   11110101 0
Byte 8:   10010110 0
ECC byte: 01000000 0
Divided up:
Cluster A         ECC-A  Cluster B ECC-B
Byte 1: 01110110  1      10100011  0
Resequenced into separate queues by byte in cluster:
01110110 11010001 10......
...and distributed to the servers.
These are just my ramblings, I'm not a programmer (or at least I haven't been for a long time).  Nor do I claim to know if this form of distribution will escape the legal issues of storing certain data on on servers in specific areas of meatspace (I'm no lawyer (kill the lawyers)).  At the very least, it seems that this scheme (or something like it, if this form of ECC is not sufficient) could be used to keep data from being lost if one or more servers gets whacked by armed forces or a nuclear bomb.  I'm not even going to think about how this data could be distributed.  You guys can do that...
Feedback and flames welcome.

Thanks for your response.  Such a simple idea, I kinda figgered (was hoping) that it was already thought of, but I hadn't heard of it.  I have been meaning to buy Schneier's book...
One of my points, however, is that if the division of the encrypted information is done properly, even if the private key were deduced by whatever means, all they would find is (for instance) the high order bits and some ECC, but nothing that could be used to regenerate any meaningful information without the other parts.  Because of this, I have been asking myself, how could any one datahaven operator be held responsible for holding classified, porn, or other information if they only have a meaningless slice of it?
Perhaps this is more a legal question (even more out of my league) than anything...  Any comments?
