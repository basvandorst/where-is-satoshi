All professional alarm systems have an "armed state" and "triggered" warning so the property owners can shut it off before any action is taken.  I'm sure something appropriate can be devised to handle false IDs.
As for the firemen, this would indeed be a weakness.
BTW, open source face recognition SW is available from Intel.
Does anyone know of open source SW which could be adapted for target tracking and fire control?  Imagine how feature-face recognition could be married with targeting and anaonymous open broadband wireless access (commuication is encrypted and only used when a possible target match has been identified) to identify, target, authorize and eliminate vermin.  OpenJackal anyone?
