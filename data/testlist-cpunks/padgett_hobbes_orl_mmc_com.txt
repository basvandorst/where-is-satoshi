This would take care of anything sitting on Int 09 or Int 16 since it would

@_subject: Protecting the innocent on the nets 
About a year ago I came up with a mechanism to allow subscription or
controlled circulation magazines to be distributed on the net. Not
saying is new, just was new to me. Seems like it would be a mechanism
for anyone to communicate/access Web pages without crypto, yet allowing
protection of such things from those requiring such protection.
Concept works like this: LZ (or most other) compressed files have two elements - a data dictionary and ordered pointers to that dictionary.
Now say you took a large number of text files/.Gifs/.Jpegs/whatever and
created a universal (well nearly) data dictionary that would fit on a CD-Rom. Using large patterns and good ordering techniques could achieve
good throughput.
Now to a group of subscribers/friends/whatever, the disk is distributed
in a controlled manner.
Once distribution is made, then what is sent on the net/put on the Web
page are just the pointers to the data dictionary plus any patterns not
in the dictionary (low enough not to create anything intelligable).
What you have is a gigantic book code with a copyrightable book for which
you can control the circulation. Those under age need not apply. If they
obtain one, then it was illegally and you have made a "good faith attempt"
IMNSLO to protect the innocent.
Can even change the CD-Rom dictionary *order* yearly/montly/whatever if
you want.

Oh Heavens to Betsy, I was not trying to describe *crypto*, that might

Figure it this way: can duplicate CD-Roms for a quarter. If a subscription
costs $19.95/yr then who is going to bother with cloning it ? "controlled
circulation" magazines would save postage. Web pages could be posted with nothing but pointers (don't tell me you have never sat waiting for a
little red bar to reach the end) and assurance that only a specified audience
could look at the pretty pictures (which compress the best of all 8*).
Further, if the intent is to satisfy a law then would this not be a "good faith" attempt to do so ? Zippy's friends have decided what is not safe to be
on the net in the clear but they have not said what it takes to protect the
innocent while allowing consenting adults their freedom to communicate.

OK you is rong.
This is normal when no parent is around.
No, most in law enforcement at the working level have no opinion one way or the other. Many I talk to know what it is but few have ever seen any more complicated than Lotto tickets. The prevailing attitute (which
I happen to share so am biased) is that >most< criminals are not very
intelligent else they would not be criminals.
Secrets rarely enter into law enforcement. Determining what the truth is
in the face of conflicting data is more often the case
At the same time, we have a massive division in this country (do not know about others) in which the aim of most citizens is to avoid any contact
with the government if at all possible since invariably the citizen loses
in the exchange.
Dangerous attitude to take. The law is never wrong because it is the law.
The fact that a law exists may be wrong but that has nothing to do with the
law itself, it merely is. The law's enforcer would be derelect in his/her
duty if she/he did *not* enforce the law.
(Now sometimes the *enforcement* is over zealous but that is a human matter.
 That is the definition of natural law, Is the great strength of the US.
No must, they do.
Disagree. There may be times when laws are violated with just csause but the violator must do so with the expectation of retribution else the law is meaningless.
However Pavlov proved that perceptions may be distorted. What is good
today may be evil tomorrow and a lack of stability leads to insanity.
To me "selective enforcement" is a cop-out.
Law enforcement is not restricted by the constitution, law *enactment*
is ("Congress shall make no law...").
No one needs to agree to the compromise. However I believe that good
crypto with key escrow (provided the escrow holder is trusted) is
compelling for a number of reasons, mainly because it provides a means to protect information that has no protection today.
Everyone screams about porn on the net. Personally I find the *concept*
of pornography to be an indication of a social problem that no one is willing
to admit to. Crypto provides a means to shield children from the "adult
conspiracy". Haven't seen any mention of that. Crypto will provide the
essential mechanism for Internet Electronic Commerce as MasterCard/Visa
have announced. If I send my 1040 to the IRS on the net, I *want* the gov
to be able to read it.
Public crypto is necessary for the US government to comply with its own
regulations. It will exist. Now there are three basic elements that must be understood as a foundation
for discussion. a) we are guarenteed free speech
b) there is no requirement that anyone must be able to understand it
c) we have no right to tell anyone not to listen. Look at these three items. Anything that denies one or more of these elements
is wrong. May take a while to realize why but will happen.
One corollary: every citizen is responsible for the effect of exercising
his/her right to free speech. You have the right to shout "fire" in a theater
or to threaten the sax man but may be arrested for it. This is not a restriction on free speech since each is narrowly defined specification.
"Libel" also carries very specific  specifications that must be met. Does anyone here think that a libel suit is a restriction on free speech ?
At the same time nothing compels speech - "You have the right to remain
Moving right along, the next question would be "could the government
restrict crypto ?" The answer is essentially no since the government
would have to first define what crypto was e.g. prove that Navajo was in fact crypto. The compelling problem is that given any random string of bits, I could come up with an algorithm/book code/OTP from which *anything* could be extracted.
Want a pedophile .GIF to extract from the Gettysburg Address - no problem.
Want to extract the Communist Manifesto from ITAR - hokay. The fact is
that anything could be shown to be an encryption of almost anything else
since good crypto is indestinguishable from random noise. The corrolry being
that it would be impossible to prove that something *wasn't* crypto.
In fact it would be possible that given an encrypted message, using one key,
a first message would appear, given another, a second. Which is the real
message ? (see the fifth amendment)
Thus it would seem to me to be (not a lawyer or a politician so what do I know
- we used to have an ordinamce near here requiring alligators to be leashed)
very difficult to legislate anything concerning crypro since first crypto
would have to be defined and second it would have to be able to be detected -
a requirement for all text to be in third-grade flat ASCII won't fly.

Don't forget the other side of the conversation. While the government cannot (notice I did not say they might not try) effectively control
communication, there are other points at which control may be exerted:
1) communications *with* the government (IRS, Social Security, etc).
2) communications using someone else's equipment/network (university,
   employer, etc)
3) communications with anyone (Internet merchant, etc) who says "this
   is not what  approves..."
Each of these may have compelling reasons for complying with what the
government wants even if it is not law. IMNSHO "law" is just a means
for exacting retribution/revenge - if you have to resort to it, you

Motorcycle helmets (required in Florida as is seat belt use) are another matter. Requiring the lights to be on is different - that makes the bike
easier for others to see. Helmet and seat belt laws are purely economic
in nature: the state wants them to reduce the load on the state supported
medical structure, motorcycle manufacturers (and auto manufacturers) support
them to keep insurance rates low (high insurance rates affect sales).
In this case the laws are "special interest" and have nothing to do with
the individual though the rationale is often "for your own good" (have been

Is something I have been saying for years & has nothing to do with "free
speech", rather it is "property rights" and in the USA they always *must* win
because when you get down to it the US is based on property rights. One
of the most basic is that "citizens are not the property of the state".
"We hold these truths...all men are created equal" referred to the separation
of nobility from the "common man". Is part of the reason Amurricns may not be
titled. However computers and networks are not people, they are property. All are owned by someone who exercises control over them. To say "you must let me use yours as I wish" is to deny "all men are created equal" (and coporations enjoy the legal fiction of being an entity. Some time in the future we may have to consider other beings (porposes ?) but not yet just as at one time slaves and "injuns" were conveniently denied.
Now if an employer/university choses not to exert any control, that is their
decision but does not mean they have given up anything (AFAIK "adverse possesion" has never been applied to a computer or network) so why be surprised
when some exercise those rights ? I agree that proper notice should be given
but that is only to stay out of court in the first place. *Every court case
I know of has been decided in favour of the property owner*.
Remedy exists. If you do not like the rules at one site, choose another. In
most places you can find a PPP provider for $20/month unmetered who will let
you do what you will. True, if you want to use the web properly, the price of
a PC has gone up from $25 since Windoze and a 256 colour display is needed,

Okay, obviously I need to drop down a gear & explain *my* feelings:
Part of the definition of a "sovereign nation" is to define and carry
out both high and low justice over it's domain - the absolute right
of a sovereign. Is not mentioned in the US constitution because it was a given. Further, the purpose of the US Constitution is to:
a) define what the sovereign was (three branches - rock, scissors, & paper)
b) set forth certain limitations on that sovereign ("Congress shall make
   no law...")
c) define certain duties of the sovereign (regulation of foreign commerce...)
(am simplifying so please bear with me)
There are some things which for which the rationale is not apparent since
the times have changed ("corruption of blood" is a "Congress shall not"
that related back to English law of the time). What "Attainder" was
is not mentioned since it was well understood.
No this gets us back to the question: to me, "regulation of foreign commerce"
has two elements - one is to prevent illegal commerce or traffic in goods that are contrary to "the public good". The other is to promote American
trade and intrests overseas. The two go together and is the point I made
at the NIST gathering in December. Quid pro quo.
"Free speech" means that a citizen is free to speak (communicate) anthing,
anytime, anywhere. This is the right guarenteed by the first amendment. This
does not relieve the individual from being liable for the consequences of the exercise of "free speech".
However, the government is under no obligation (though in the silly seventies
it seemed that we were going that way) to aid or abet in the exercise of
free speech. If it were properly and legally decided that communications with anon.penet.fi is against "national interest" then the sovereign has not only the "right" but the *duty* to block/monitor such communications.
Now as to the second part of the question, I have never said that the conditions mentioned above could not legally exist (though I have my
doubts about legality internally and between citizens - is part of the
reasons American Corporations have never had a problem getting a license
for use with foreign offices). What I said was that any such regulation
would be impossible to enforce for two reasons:
1) While current crypto advertises its presence, crypto exists which
   is indestinguishable from random noise and would be impossible to
   prove was used. Further it would be necessary to specify what was
   not crypto (and the law frowns on negatives). Navaho, Basque, PKZIP,
   and EBCDIC are examples that fall readily to mind.
2) The second objection is more obscure but should be considered in places
   that lack our constitutional protections: given a message, any message,
   I can demonstrate a OTP or algorithm that will turn that into any
   message desired. Therefore just the existance of a message and a
   decrypt would be insufficient to prove the "chain" that one led from/to
   the other.
Thus in the one case, I referring to the obligations/limitations that our constitution places on the US government (is what it is really about). In
the other I was referring to what it is *possible* for the government to do without considering legality (if they can't, does not matter if legal). Does this clear up the confusion ?
ps just to add some more wood "any law that can not be demonstrated to be
   universally enforceable with the resources allocated should be repealed".

2) Using secure channels
3) With good application filters (could be created - that I do not know

traffic and what of the I'net's capabilities they are willing to give up
to achieve that goal.

be done from what *should* be done. This is a "can" and is also considering
the fact that a sovereign nation has the *right* to do this unless it gives

Now in the case of extra-National communications, I believe that in certain
cases the Nation-state has not only the sovereign right of control but the obligation to control. For example just to pick a popular example, France might negotiate a trade agreement with the USA that included an agreement to block all PGP communications between the two countries. That would be legal.
What the US does not really have is the *ability* to control communications.

@_subject: Numbers don't lie... 
Have finally gotten around to reading the Jersey Seven paper on keylengths.
Is rather amazing since if anything they are being conservative with some
of their numbers - are using 30 Mhz for the FPGA where I have been using 40 & using 200 Mhz for ASICs where I would use 300 (year and a half ago I used
150mhz based on what I knew *had* been built, not what I knew X-ray lithography is capable of.
In their figures, they do seem to gloss over a couple of minor points:
The most compelling to me is "how do you know when you broke it ?". Bruce
has always used the "known plaintext" approach, however using modern techniques for messaging, *every* message has a different session key,
negotiated using assymetric keying so the only message that will be broken
is one that you already have - not terribly helpful.
The second point is that their scalability seems to be based on costs per
chip alone, cost for which the engineering cost has been recovered and for
which the yeild is significant, hardly givens when you are talking pushing
the state of the art, given this 200 Mhz Pentiums would be U$10.00 also
(well, maybe U$25.00).
Finally, no cost is allocated to the sustem required to program/evaluate
the ponderings of these 100's of ASICs. As anyone who has ever programmed
a massively parallel computer (which is what they are talking about in their
brute force machine, it is the boundary communications that kill you.
True, each machine could operate on a specific portion of the keyspace with
bits fixed as a function of its address, but each will need to be loaded
with the plaintext to match and have some means to communicate success.
You also have to consider that dividing the keyspace may result in some
processors running slower than others due to the values used. Another minor
problem in parallel processors.
The cost is given of U$300,000 to build a SOA machine that could break DES
in 3 hours. Using the 200 Mhz (2*10^8) figure and assuming 1 trial per clock (being nice), a single chip will test 2.2*10^12 keys in that period.
2^55 is otoa 3.6*10^16 so will require 16,680 thingies running
in parallel. If they can get the chips for U$10, they will be able to allocate another whole U$10.00 per chip to the support structure and basic
programming to stay inside the budget. Since this will hardly be a production process, I suspect that the cost might be a tad higher.
Now often banking and EDI (as opposed to EC) does make the mistake of using the same key for more than one message. Similarly a firewall<>firewall
connection might beep a single keyed channel open for multiple sessions.
This would be at risk. But for individual messages.
The paper does make an appropriate observation: the cost is essentially
fixed per key (scaling is not perfect but can ignore that for the moment
- has to do with why Crays are circular and Grace's "nanosecond"). This means
that the strength of cryptography should be appropriate to the value of
the information protected. If less than U$10,000, the message is individually
encrypted, and has value only today, then DES is probably "good enough".
Strategic information of higher value arguably needs "more" but how much ?
64 bits is 256 times stronger than DES. This would indicate effective
security up to say U$2.5 million. More is better but I would not be quite
so alarmist nor would I dismiss the cost of engineering. Non-trivial.
Do agree that 40 bits is the same as no crypto at all (reminds me of Bob
Clampett's "No Bikini Atoll" but is another hobby entirely).
Still, at what point is it simply easier/cheaper to buy someone who knows the secret ?

a) chips do not need makeup
b) t'were me, I would just fix the chip so that instead of 2^56 (DES) keys

Oh I agree it *can* be done (thouse who follow RISKS and SCI.CRYPT will note
that I was talking about cascadable single bit boolean processors and DSPs
for brute force engines several years ago. We seem to be miscommunicating
a bit though. I agree that such an engine is easier to design than something like a MASPAR or Alliance since each set of kerchunkers can operate independantly once started and all that is necessary is to be able to
signal success and pass the found code.
Still, the logistics of initializing each processor set (and ones I have
dealt with have primarily been matricies of single bit devices), providing
communications, power, and control is a non-trivial task: once you have
a general purpose ASIC, you are only half way there, particularly if it is
to be usable for more than one fixed algorithm/key length.
Will further stipulate that a single PC (8088 even) would probably be sufficient to load/start/retrieve data from such a beast but design of the
I/O would still need to be accomplished. Not difficult, just necessary.
My point was not that it couldn't be done, but that the costs mentioned

setup for each run would probably take longer than the cracking ( assuming

Subj:	Re: ViaCryptPGP 4.0?! (was Re: PGP integrated into Z-Mail) For those who have joined us recently, PGP v 2.6x is essentially free for
individual use under MIT's (and the gov's) exemption/permission for the
use of patents helt at the moment by PKP/Cylink/RSA (not even going to
get into that mess).
For commercial use a license to use the RSA and IDEA components is
necessary through fate or some such ViaCrypt obtained such a license
before PGP became a Big Thing and with Phil's blessing formed a commercial
unit to distribute what is called ViaCrypt PGP.
Because of what I do, I spent the money to purchse the first product,
ViaCrypt PGP v2.4 (PGP 2.3 analogue). In due course, when PGP v2.5 and
2.6x came out, Viacrypt followed suit with v2.7 and then 2.71 for Windows
and I upgraded.
Because the next "public" release is scheduled to be 3.0, the next ViaCrypt
which will include the corporate featured (with escrow capability) Business
Edition will be known as 4.0 with versions for PC, Mac, Unix, and VMS.
Both 2.7 and what I have seen of 4.0 (not released yet) have a switch that
allows backwards compatability if desired (know back to 2.3, not sure about
earlier ones).
The most compelling features of 4.0 are the floating toolbar or "Enclyptor"
which allows use inside any Windoze program that supports cut & paste (have
used it inside a Telnet session with a remote host and inside ccMail) and
the "group" feature.

@_subject: Copyrighted code and executable ASCII 
Since several have asked and it serves several points, I present
the following (also am interested in coderpunks - does this
constitute a qualification ?).
Point the first. A couple of years ago questions arose concerning
executable ASCII. I had played with the concept back around the time
I was doing memory maps of Bendix 930s and Mil-Std-1750s but never went
very far with it. The concept was ressurected c.a. 1988 with a concern
about multi-platform viruses (not talking macros or portable source,
but true multi-platform binaries - can to the conclusion that dual
platform was doable, triple possible but very difficult, and four
bl**dy unlikely.
Around 1990 some people in Germany developed a program (sorry, I do
not recall the citation but wanted to acknowlege the fact - believe the program is on SimTel mirrors). That program was buggy and not
suitable for E-mail through certain gateways and recipients.
In 1994, there was a flurry of concern about E-Mail vulnerability
and the subject came up again. We have had "ASCIIrizers" for some time:
TekHex was one of the first I was aware of, then UUencode, PGP "Ascii
Armor", and others. All required an client side file for decoding or
the even cruder DEBUG scripting mechanisms. Looking at an Intel CPU
instruction map, it became apparent that there was an entire class
of instructions contained wholly within the RFC-822 compliant area.
The result was my 1994 "Christmas Card". Since then I improved the
algorithm somewhat reducing the first 129 character line to 64 characters
(not sure why that was a target other than the max & min terms said
yes and that is what UUencode uses so is known to work).
This brings up the second point. Rewriting Copyrighted algorithms as
is being discussed in relation to Royal Crown Cola (tm). Was once told that one test was that at least 20% of the code must be different.
Now when using a compiler this is difficult to demonstrate because the included libraries make up much of the code. Assembly programming is
different. Sometimes things must be done in a particular order to work
at all. The enclosed code is an example: the bulk of the program is trivial, compression is lousy but that was not the intent. The key is in the first lime of code that makes it all possible, operable on
everything from an 8088 to a 486 (do not know about Pentium - do not have one, nor a power PC but no one who received last year's card
It may be possible to change some of the registers and possibly
some of the order but the stack is the stack. So here is a question:
can that first line be changed sufficiently to satisfy the "independantly
developed" tests whatever they may be. No credit for lengthening the
line. Kudos for shortening but would be surprised if more than a couple of bytes could be removed while maintaining the functionality
(some things were done to maintain compatability with the different
pipeline mechanisms used by Intel and at least one kludge was necessary to avoid a bug in the Intel microcode).
For those who would like the source code: sorry, it does not exist,
all programming of the first line was done using DEBUG. There is
an .ASM of the whole file but it contains a long "DB" directive.
I have signed the code for authenticity. The executable file must start with the first "X" as the first byte (could have put logo in front. Didn't.). All the "P"s were deliberate.
Will only work with true .COM files up to about 30k. Does not need to be so limited, just is & has nothing to do with the first line, just
is a PoP & I was lazy 8*).
Coderpunks are also welcome to comment.
ps have launched .COM directly from ccMail attachment before.

The ones I know who could, don't. Is considerably harder to write an

You missed my point (and my canary trap). When a Pentium starts up it is
in 8086 "real" mode and is limited to the same 1 Mb basic address space
(know about the 64k - 16 bytes, is different from 8086/8).
What I was referring to was the "640k limit" imposed by 1-2-3 waaaay back

It is not that they are written badly, just that most virus writers lack
experience and their worldview is narrow - the [Mich] we mentioned - is

all he/she/it/other knew of were either 360k or 1.2 Mb. "Nightfall" writer

write a .VXD - not easy). Take Michelangelo (please) is a member of a
class of viruses the is very difficult to detect: you have to read one
word at 0:414 from DOS to know something is wrong.
True, in early '92 when [Mich] came out things were more difficult - not
everyone had 640k in their machine so the user acurally had to have a clue
how much memory was supposed to be there. Today is there anyone with 512k ?
Detection has *always* been easy, it is removal that is difficult and
*automated* removal that is even more so - know what it takes to determine
that there is a macro that might be a virus in a WORD document ? One bit.
(Of course things are made a bit more difficult by the fact that MicroSoft
considers that bit's location or even its *existance* to be "proprietary"
and requires an NDA before they will discuss it - I refuse to sign it).
In recent months I have had all sorts of software blow up in Windows. On this machine alone (a 486DX-100 w 8 Mb of RAM & Win 3.1, 1 Mb SVGA
and nothing special), Reachout 5.0, FTP Onnet 2.0, QEMM 8.0 (Windows Manager),
and several name brand programs  have required massage to get to play together - and these are the programs from people I consider expert at what
they do, in fact each is IMNSHO the best in their class.
And you tell me that someone is going to spread a virus on the net that will
capture keystrokes on any machine it hits without anyone noticing ? It is to laugh (and if they can, they are wasting their time with credit card (Did I mention that the documentation those signing the M$ NDA have been receiving has been *wrong* ?)
Not going to say you could not make one machine act that way - that is easy, not even going to say you won't make a number of machines act that way, but
spread with a virus enough will self-destruct on enough machines that intelligent people will get suspicious and some will react creatively.
Fact is that the greatest protection the net has is that no two machines are
alike, may even start that way but after six months, no way.

MasterCard conrols MarterCard numbers by issuing all of them (and I suspect

Today, each person generates their own PGP key. While it is unlikely that
any two will match, it is likely that at some point some two will match

Next rage might well be "vanity" PGP keys. While at the moment it is not known
how to create a specific match key to a sequence, if you generate enough
keys, there will be some interesting sequences found. Possibly some PGP
signatures will even be in violation of the CDA (now that should start a

For some time I have been concerned about the scalability of PGP. It works
well in small groups but after trying once to create a 6,000 member keyring
(took over three days on a 386 & was several meg when done) I decided that
areas were going to need work to be a real anyone/anywhere/anytime mechanism. Not saying I have a good answer, just that at some point there

Derek rites:
I disagree but then my worldview is different. For personal use the
compact distributed system is workable however when you start thinking
in terms of a large distributed organization, the quanta changes.
Mention was made of the difficulty of handling 20,000 keys. I am looking at
over 80,000 today and over 200,000 tomorrow *for a single organization*. For
quantities like this, a hierarchial system of management seems inevitable.
First, I am not about to give up my personal PGP key, it is trustworthy and
effective for my needs. It is not necessarily incompatable with an organizational structure.
However *for the organization* something else is needed. I can see a future in which the bulk of the population has only two keys: their own
and the punlic key of their post office (not talking USNail - private ones
though not saying the US might not operate one as well).
Messages are composed with addressing and encrypted with the PO key. PO
decrypts message key (NOT necessarily message but that will have to rely
on trust - nothing will stop double wrapping anyway), checks address list,
retrieves key for each adressee, adds header & sends copy (may use single mailing for group at distant post office but that is getting ahead).
If recipient key is not found, adressee wil be removed from list and
notice sent back to originator. If plaintext is desired, special operation will be required.
As noted, a hierarchal mechanism will be needed for key retrieval - only local
keys and "frequent fliers" will be kept locally. Not new concept, just
not used by post offices that I know of today.
Will need a bit of fleshing out and expect the end-state to be 2-4 years out

Is nice to plan for each up front but often the succeding generation risks
only become apparent after living with the preceeding generation solution
for a while. This should not prevent anyone from implementing the first
because of what *might* happen in the second. "Doing nothing" is a sound
solution only for politicians. Besides the purpose of "duress codes" is not just to provide an avenue for
use in case of threat, it is also to deter the threat in the first place
by reducing the "win" probability for those who might issue the threat.

Actually can think of several phleneomum that would satisfy but
first need to separate transactions into relating to electronic items
and relating to physical items.
In the case of physical items, pickup for shipping is probably done in batches (example: for FedEx the last pickup typically at 5 pm). It is not necessary to verify transactions instantaneously but rather when the order
is processed /shipped. This could be done in a batch mode syncronized with
order processing.
In the case of electronic media there are two choices: either immediate access
or delayed access. In the first case either access can be granted or immediate
verification can be done. In the case of immediate access, it should be
limited to items of restricted value. In delayed access the same batch
processing mode can be performed (during the 0-dark hours most likely).
This leaves only cases where immediate access must be granted and I suspect

However I suspect that Markoff really meant to be referring to mathematical

Microsoft's CryptoAPI seems OK. PGP would seem to fall under both (i) and (ii).
     "(3) SOFTWARE WITH ENCRYPTION CAPABILITIES.-The Secretary of Commerce       shall authorize the export or reexport of software with encryption       capabilities for nonmilitary end-uses in any country to which exports       of software of similar capability are permitted for use by financial       institutions not controlled in fact by United States persons, unless       there is substantial evidence that such software will be-

Thank you MasterCard/VISA for SET. Note that it does not seem to say that

Realy two questions - will treat each in order
It is possible to design a "prophylactic" environment that would control
the interaction between your web browser and the PC. As was determined with
FV's keystroke monitor, it only worked because nothing prevented it, not
because nothing could prevent it. Such links can be prevented from
gathering information but I suspect it would be more creative to feed it
information that you would like others to believe.
This is a different question. By nature, web transactions are interactive
which means that both sides must know how to reach each other. You could set
up a limited proxy and load it with the preferred information but I suspect
it would be easier to just send $20 and a requested username/password to a local provider for a PPP account. Would not be "anonymous" but if done carefully, the provider would not have to know who was using the account.
In the case of my local provider, no proof of my identity was ever required
and the entire set-up was done over the telephone (and I was not at home
at the time). Did not try to hide my identity but could have.

  Well if we *must* use D-H that is a way, but why do that ? Instead of
  using a binary assymetric key, why not a triple ? (Just because I do not
  know of any does not mean that one does not exist).
  Consider a function such that Alice has a key such that given a message M,
  when encrypted by Alice may be manipulated by T such that Bob can decrypt
  it. Similarly, Bob has a key that when manipulated by T' can be read by
  Alice. Assymetric but not binary. The advantage here is that while "T"
  is trusted by both, he/she/it/other is not able to read either message,   rather acts as a catalyst.
  Such a mechanism could be as indicated or could be circular e.q. a cipher   such that A can generate a message readable by T who can generate a message   redable by B who can generate one readable by A. True you could do this with   three pairs of keys distributed alternatively so that a single person can
  only write left and read right.
  As to why you would want such a curiosity, consider a corporation with 80,000
  mailboxes. It would be desirable for each person to be able to send E-Mail
  to any other person but not desirable for each person to have to hold all
  80,000 keys.
  Given a triple (tertiary ?) function each individual would only need their
  receive key and a "post office" transmit key. On sending a message, it would
  be encrypted with a session key and the session key encrypted with the
  post office key.
  The post office would have all 80,000 receive functions but through the   assymetic keying would only be able to convert the session key to something
  each intended recipient could decode but not be able to decode the message
  itself.
  This would meet both criteria (not key escrow but that is under "management")
  D-H is wonderful but has difficulties with scalability. If such a function
  existed (has anyone looked ?) it would solve the problem.

Agree, problem was that to get into E-Mail had to cut/paste in 255 bytes
segments but the quoted part is what I got off VTW with minor line
length adjustment and separation of elements for clarity. No, what the wording seems to outlaw was the use of encryption to obstruct the commission of the crime, not the investigation.  Read it again please.
Thought the gotcha was down in the part about the Secretary of Commerce. My reading is that the secretary will still be required to grant
approval for commercial export. Is past the part about no regulation
inside the US (which is true now - still would be nice to see a "Congress
shall make no law..."). The puzzler is the requirement that a comperable foreign product must exist before permission to export will be granted.
Will this be like "comparable product" price matching in discount houses ?
Somehow there never is one...

@_subject: Bootable disks 
Have made some small study of that area and would be somewhat surprised if
possible as advertised (BIOS would need some reason to look for disk on
parallel port).
What *might* be possible is to create a floppy that would install a device
driver that would install directly on top of the BIOS intercepts that
would transfer the boot to the Syquest but this would only work for an OS that did not replace the BIOS access with "something else" unless
you had a driver for *that*.
If you *really* wanted to go overboard, it would also be possible to create
a PROM that could be plugged into the "bootp" socket of a NIC and do the
same thing but the floppy route would be lots easier. A prom is how Iomega
used to be able to make Bernoullis the boot disk - went into a socket on
the PC2B (and earlier combo) card.
Incidently more than one "hard disk encryption system" using this method has been broken once I have grabbed the intercept out of a booted system. Is
also effective for recovering from CPTs.

@_subject: Bootable disks 
Several years ago Insite had a "floptical" drive that could handle both
regular 3 1/2" and special 20Mb flopical drives. Iomega followed suit and
there was an industry spec. Compression would yeid 40 Mb capacity to
a marketeer. (Can tell a floptical disk easily - the write protect slide is on the other side).
Was a great idea then that was marred by U$500 for the drive and U$20 for
the cartriges. Never flew.  Three years development would give 80 Mb easily (100 Mb Iomega "ZIP" disks
could have been put in a normal 3 1/2 case - is a lot of waste space
on either side. Think it was kind of dumb that they didn't but suppose
there is a marketing reason - probably the same marketeers that insisted
that each new Bernoulli be incompatable with earlier ones.)
Major difference is that the floptical could be made bootable but then
it had a special SCSI card, did not plug into the normal floppy controller & have to tell the BIOS that drive B was not there. The card
then added a BIOS extension similar to what I mentioned in an earlier post to access the disk.
For that matter, any drive that has a controller on the bus *could* be made
bootable with a PROM. It is only those that plug into the parallel port
- all of which require special drivers - that would need "help".

the [boot] section. This is the default 16 color driver installed by Windows to be compatible with every 256k 640x480 VGA card.
This makes a decent GIF or JPEG  - even "64 gray scale" such as the
QuickCam produces - look like olifactory solid waste products.
To do better, you need three things:
1) A video card with higher resolution (usually at least 1 Mb of video    memory is necessary).
2) A video monitor capable of supporting the card's output.
3) An increased resolution (at least 256 colors as the first responder
   mentioned) video driver to replace vga.drv (YMMV).
If any of these are missing, see the second paragraph above.

@_subject: Leahy and Mrs. Bemmis (now that's a subject line) 
First, would like to comment that some people do not like some of my
beliefs. Tough. Do try to be honest and consistant about them. One of
them is that while the US is imperfect, it is better than anything else
I have seen (and have seen more than a few) and has the potential to remain great. Do believe in the "sovereign right of nations" to be a fact. Also believe
in human rights personally but do not expect governments to agree merely
because I say so.
Some favor direct action. I prefer the "theater of the absurd" & have found that most people are able to recognize absurdity when they see it, particularly if carried to extreems. Most of life is absurd to those who
are able to really enjoy it.
The Leahy bill is flawed in two areas. Sent a message with proposed wording
to Sen. Leahy via his web page but have not gotten a response. Have a bad
habit of reading laws without thought since this is how LEA and prosecutors
are told to enforce them - as written, not as believed. If an area is
vague, a court is required to decide how to interpret it, not LEA. If badly
written *everyone* loses.
At the same time am pragmatic enough to accept the idea that it will have
no effect unless it passes and to be passed today it must have something
like the criminalization statement. The goal here should not be to throw
it out since that would simply cause the whole bill to fail, but to word
it carefully enough that it satisfies those who reguire laws while being
narrow enough to avoid exploitation. IMNSHO the best way to do that is to
require that: 1) A felony occured (curiously misdemeanors were ommitted)    and
2) That the individual to be charged was an active participant (before,
        during, or after the fact)    and
3) That encryption was used in furtherance.
Note: that in the US (1) and (2) seem sufficient for a criminal charge to be brought, so does (3) really add anything except words or possibly severity ?
Seizure seems to be a great concern of the group with the point of the
Bemmis Pontiac being brought up. For someone providing a free remailer,
that is a valid concern since the first question a court might ask is
"what was the motivation". I suspect that someone providing a remailer
and charging a reasonable fee to all who might want to use the service
might be in a much better position (not a lawyer so not allowed to know). One indicator might be easy to check: Has there ever been a seizure involving a rental car (Hertz, Avis, etc.) and if so, what was the disposition ?

Next you need a backplane with an input mechanism to prime each of those
