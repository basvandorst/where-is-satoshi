What's there to reject in "Yeah, I'm happy with what I want, so fuck
you?" (Which is essentially what this reclaming stuff is). Of course,
I see nothing wrong with rejecting postmodernist intellectuals :-) but
they have stolen some good ideas.
Let's not forget memoizing, either. Kinda space ineficient, but with a
decent virtual memory system you can cache perviously-used solutions
and go real fast. Hmmm, like, say you were for some reason trying to
factor a multitude of large composites. Precomputing everything would
probably be rather inefficient, but once you've factords something,
why throw it away? (I knew there would be some crypto relevance in
here :-)
