I agree with Mozena. I like to hunt down and slaughter people who
use the word 'reference' in their posts, and I'm getting damn tired
of wasting my valuable time because some assholes want to remain
  I always knew I was above average, and now I have *proof*.

Please be advised that the "Psycho Killers" in Austin, Texas, have
already drafted Tim C. May. However, if we lose too many players in
trying to 'enforce' our 'right' to have him play for us, then we
may be open to trade negotiations.
