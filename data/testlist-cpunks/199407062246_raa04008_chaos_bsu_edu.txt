Can anyone tell me if one can use PGP 2.6 with an online service [America
Online]. From what the FAQ says, I need an actual UNIX account rather than
just an E-Mail Gateway. Is this true?
If not, then how do I encrypt without attaching the pgp file [which goes only
to other AOL users] or without using BinHex and inserting THAT into my
message body? Not all of my peers use AOl or possess BinHex.
