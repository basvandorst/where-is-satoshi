   [1]SonOfGates writes "Well, the Aussies have invaded Boston but at
   least they're not throwing tea into the harbor. AU-based nonprofit
   [2]CAcert Inc has spent the last few days at [3]USENIX '04 registering
   new users by the truckload. They bill themselves as a 'Community-Based
   CA.' Could this be the begining of a true 'open' certificate
   authority? See the [4]O'Reilly story and [5]press release."
