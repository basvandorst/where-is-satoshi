@_subject: Ms. Nym's stigmata 
A quick review of the patent stigmata:
Frequent Biblical allusions, particularly fond of apocalyptic references.
Attempts to mask underlying obsession with veneer of rationality.
Fixation on multiple personalities (tentacles, "pseudo-anonymity").
 [ and later ]
Frequent mention of Perry Metzger.
Standard unit of torment: Perry Metzger.
Tireless apologist and supporter of government.
Paranoia never far below the surface.
