# you write:
Good idea in theory but won't work in practice. The stats generated by the
anonymous remailer show that less than 40% of the messages passing thru
are encrypted. Most people would find being forced to encrypt a huge
inconvenience. BTW everyone, when I say stats, I mean the primitive stats
generated by the remailer and are available to anyone sending email to
remailer at jpunix.com with the subject being remailer-stats. Don't start
asking me if I get these stats by logging! I don't log. You are talking about fortress remailers. This is currently under discussion. Stay tuned.
Good in theory once again, but bad in practice. This would entice the
abusers to jeopardize several remailers instead of just one. Every
remailer that spam/proprietary-stuff goes through would be potentially at
risk also. If remailers are going to be legally jeopardized, I would think the impact would be less if it were one instead of many. But, there is also safety in numbers. Hmm...

@_subject: premail 0.30 
In a previous message, Michael K. Sanders said:
That's interesting that it works that way on your system. I have premail
installed here as /usr/lib/sendmail and I still have a ~/.premailrc that
premail reads. I have aliases installed in my own ~/.premailrc that allows
my messages to be automatically encrypted to the recipients in tha alias
list. Are you SURE yours doesn't operate this way also?

@_subject: Elm and premail (long) 
jpunix.com. Since there have been some questions about how to do this type
of thing, I thought I'd give a blow-by-blow description of what I did and
the pro's, con's and alternatives to what I did. 1) I installed premail as a wedge to the sendmail daemon. In other words,
per Raph Levin's instructions in his README file, I renamed sendmail to
something else and then renamed premail to sendmail and have it pointing
to the renamed sendmail. I realize this requires system admin privs and is
a big step to take, but I have testing premail working as the sendmail
program with great success and at this point I have no qualms about
premail/sendmail being one in the same. 2) I created the ~/.premailrc file in my home directory per Raph's README
file. There is an option at the bottom to create aliases and that is what
I did at first. Then, I discovered that the alias database created by Elm
is compatible with premail!! 3) I edited ~/.elm/aliases.text to make changes similar to the following: The alias raph = Levin; Raph = raph at kiwi.cs.berkeley.edu
raph = Levin; Raph = raph at kiwi.cs.berkeley.edu^key=raph at cs.berkeley.edu
parses it just fine!  I could have added a ^chain=3 also, but I decided
that I may not want to email Raph through a set of remailers every time. I
decided I would add the extra header during message creation. More on this
later. Raph, it will automatically be encrypted with his public key with no further intervention on my part! When I want to chain the message through some remailers, I just take the H)eaders option from the Elm pre-send menu and add a header line:
Chain: 3
remailers before it gets to Raph.
creation of encrypted messages for people NOT in my alias file, signing messages, and reading PGP encrypted messages that are not MIME compliant.
These scripts are mailpgp and morepgp. These Perl scripts were published with version 2.3 of PGP but work fine with 2.4 and up. In Elm, I went to the options menu and replaced the default editor with mailpgp as well as the visual editor. I also replaced the default builtin+ display parameter with morepgp. These two Perl scripts are listed at the end of this message. The mailpgp script will allow you to encrypt and sign messages right before they are sent. The morepgp script will decrypt/verify incoming messages on the fly. The really nice benefit of these scripts is that you can reply to cleartext version of PGP encrypted messages.

@_subject: New Remailer feature 
Hello Raph,
to point out that jpunix supports a feature not mentioned in your
message/finger mechanism. Jpunix.com also supports the ability to have
messages encrypted to the recipient by the remailer itself. This will
protect cleartext messages sent back to the sender via reply blocks. By
Encrypt-Key: yourkey
to the header list for jpunix.com, jpunix will encrypt anything following a ** on a line by itself with that key.

@_subject: MX'ing and jpunix.com 
individuals that want to run an anonymous remailer but don't want the
domain they are operating from to be immediately apparent. By making
application to perry at jpunix.com, a remailer operator will be granted a DNS
MX record pointing to the domain address of the requestor's choice and will appear to reside in the jpunix.com (alias.net) domain. to myriad.pc.cc.cmu.edu. What good does this do? I have an agreement with
myriad.pc.cc.cmu.edu (Matt Ghio) where myriad will take the MX-pointed
record and additionally alias it through the smail daemon on myriad. This
function adds the unique benefit where determining the actual location of
the remailer in question will be foiled when using nslookup.  Since an
additional alias is performed the result of an nslookup will always point
to myriad. The actual location of the remailer remains hidden inside the
alias on myriad. Lastly, Matt has the EXPN function of his sendmail daemon
disabled so the identity of the remailer can't be determined by alias
expansion. step whereby the MX-alias process will cause a version of Raph Levien's
premail to post-process the message to add one or more random remailer
paths the the overall path that the message travels. This step in still in
the planning stages and has not been implemented yet. email to: perry at jpunix.com or ghio at myriad.pc.cc.cmu.edu

@_subject: retiring my remailer.. 
permanently shortly after I send this message. I spent my holidays fighting spams, running out of disk space because of spams and people sending HUGE binaries, and running out of swap space. mature or developed enough for remailers. The intended purpose has been
completely ignored while abuse is growing almost geometrically on a daily
basis. I have concluded that running a remailer on the Internet is like
giving a bunch of terrorists a nuclear bomb and then telling them "But
only use it for good!". There just doesn't seem to be much point in
thrashing my disks and computer to aid somebody in net abuse. I hardly
ever (never) see any use of the remailer for the purposes it was intended. BTW as I type this, mailgate.mail.aol.com is hammering my port 25 every 30 seconds. The contents of the spam being passed thru my system essentially says:
          THIS IS A MAIL BOMB!!
          **** BOOM ***
