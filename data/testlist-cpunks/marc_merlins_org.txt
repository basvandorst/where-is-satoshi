There is no magic involved, it's just time consuming and virtually no
companies have staff they are willing to spend on it.
Also, that's a server distribution with fewer than 200 packages.
My laptop:
gandalfthegreat:~$ dpkg --list | wc -l
server magic:~$ dpkg --list | wc -l
server gargamel:~# dpkg --list | wc -l        You get the point, it's time consuming, especially if you're checking /
stripping each package first, including fixing parts that make the package
non invariant on rebuilds.
We also had a package diff-er that accounted for zipped man pages, pyc files, and other files that changed each time you rebuilt them.
But really, not rocket science.
