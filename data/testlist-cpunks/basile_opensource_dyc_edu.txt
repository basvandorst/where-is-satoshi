@_subject: tor-ramdisk MIPS 20090828 released 
Hi everyone,
I want to announce to the list that a new rlease of the MIPS port of
tor-ramdisk is out. Tor-ramdisk is uClibc-based micro Linux distribution
whose only purpose is to host a Tor server in an environment that
maximizes security and privacy.
This release implements the changes included in the recent i686 release,
but for the MIPS architecture:  tor was updated to 0.2.1.19, busybox to
1.14.3 and the kernel was reconfigured to provide FILE_LOCKING required
by tor's new 0.2.1.x branch.  Tor node "mufasa" is running this release
in the wild.

Hi everyone,
I want to announce to the list that tor-ramdisk MIPS 20090710 is out. Tor-ramdisk is an i686 or MIPS uClibc-based micro Linux distribution
whose only purpose is to host a Tor server in an environment that
maximizes security (hardnened binaries and kernel) and privacy (no
logging at any level).  Everything runs in RAM so no information
survives a reboot except fot he Tor configuration file and RSA key which
can be imported/exported via FTP.
Change Log:
This MIPS release implements the changes in the i686 release of
20090627. Tor was update to 0.2.0.35. Busybox was updated to 1.14.1 and
the kernel was updated to 2.6.28.10.  It has been tested in the wild:
node "Mufasa" is running the image on a Miktrotik rb433ah board.

@_subject: Tor-ramdisk 20091123 (i686) and 20091124 (MIPS) released 
Hi everyone,
I want to announce to the list that new rleases of tor-ramdisk are out.
Tor-ramdisk is an i686 and MIPS uClibc-based micro Linux distribution
whose only purpose is to host a Tor server in an environment that
maximizes security and privacy.  Security is enhenced by hardening the
kernel and binaries, and privacy is enhanced by forcing logging to be
off at all levels so that even the Tor operator only has access to
minimal information.  Finally, since everything runs in ephemeral
memory, no information survives a reboot, except for the Tor
configuration file and the private RSA key, which may be
exported/imported by FTP.
These releases update tor to 0.2.1.20 and busybox to 1.15.2 on both
architectures.  Users are encouraged to upgrade since these updates
address issues which may effect the memroy-restricted ramdisk environment.
Nodes "simba" and "mufasa" have been running the i686 and MIPS versions
for about one week in the wild.

@_subject: Anyone running Tor on routing/switching hardware ? 
Close, take a look at the MIPS port of tor-ramdisk:
    General Information:              MIPS Specific Information: Node "mufasa" has been running this last March I think.  Its a Mikrotik
RB433AH which sports an Atheros AR7161 which is a MIPS processor.  If
there is interest, I can port tor-ramdisk to other router archs.

Hi everyone
I want to announce to the list that a new release of tor-ramdisk is out.
Tor-ramdisk is an i686, x86_64 or MIPS uClibc-based micro Linux
distribution whose only purpose is to host a Tor server in an
environment that maximizes security and privacy. Security is enhanced by
hardening the kernel and binaries, and privacy is enhanced by forcing
logging to be off at all levels so that even the Tor operator only has
access to minimal information. Finally, since everything runs in
ephemeral memory, no information survives a reboot, except for the Tor
configuration file and the private RSA key, which may be
exported/imported by FTP or SSH.
This release adds scp functionality using openssh-5.6p1 to export/import
the configuration file and private RSA key. The build system was
reworked to build dynamically linking binaries rather than static. Also,
tor was updated to 0.2.1.27, busybox to 1.17.4, and the kernel to
2.6.32.25 plus Gentoo's hardened-patches-2.6.32-30.extras.

This release incorporates an important security fix from upstream
following a breach of some Tor project servers.  Only tor was bumped to
version 0.2.1.22 while everything else remain the same as the 20100115
release.  The change was made to the i686, MIPS, and x86_64 images.

This is an early release to address a bug in the dhcp client for the
i686 port only. We did not update tor which remains stable at 0.2.1.26,
but we did update busybox to 1.17.2 and the kernel to 2.6.32.23 +
Gentoo's hardened-patches-2.6.32-22.extras.

This release addresses a heap overflow in tor which allows arbitrary
remote code execution. Tor was bumped to version 0.2.1.29 to address
CVE-2011-0427. Busybox was bumped to... 1.18.2 and the kernel to
2.6.32.28 plus Gentoo's hardened-patches-2.6.32-37.extras.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Tor banned in Pakistan. 
Very disturbing.   I wonder if its possible to hide encrypted traffic as
seemingly unencrypted http traffic in much the same way as a gpg key is
rendered as ascii armored, or stenographically inside images.  Although
such methods may be inefficient, they may be good enough for some purposes.
It would be good to know what technologies these ISPs will implement to
do the packet inspection for encrypted tunnels.  Half the problem is you
don't really know what they'll be looking for and so you don't know how
to circumvent.

Tor was updated to 0.2.2.37, BusyBox to 1.20.1 and the kernel to 3.4.2  plus Gentoo's hardened-patches-3.4.2-2.extras. The MIPS port also  incorporated these changes, but for this architecture the kernel was kept at vanilla 3.2.5.
