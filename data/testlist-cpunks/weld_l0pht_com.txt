I don't think that the  Interceptor is going to be much use with spread spectrum reception.  Unless you are really, really close to your target other non-ss signals are going to be much stronger.  The freq range of the device is 30MHz-2GHz.  It is also legal to sell even though it is great at picking up the cellular phone conversations in the car you are tailing. There is also the plausible deniability in a device like this because you don't know what frequency you are listening to so you don't know if it is one of those "illegal ones".
A directional antenna isn't much use with a device like this because
it will pick up many other stronger signals that will overwhelm your
target transmission.  I am speaking of suburban or urban areas here.
This may work if you are in a rural region where there are no cell
towers, braodcast towers, or repeaters in use.
The Scout is a just frequency counter so you must have a scanner or
the Interceptor  to actually listen in. - Weld Pond -

Netscape Commerce Server Security Broken
Integrated Computing Engines Inc. (ICE), in Cambridge, Mass. announced it has cracked the 40-bit DES [huh? not RC4] encryption in the Netscape Commerce Server.  Unlike a similar security break-in [talk about bad terminology] by a French university student last August, which required eight days, 120 workstations, and two supercomputers, ICE said it used a computer that cost $83,000 and compromised the Wold Wide Web server's security in 7.7 days. [Hey, what about the Cypherpunks crack that only took 31.8 hours?] Netscape Communications Corp. officials were not surprised by the security crack. "We've known that 40-bit encryption is breakable since we shipped the server.  That's the reason it's allowed to be exported," said company spokeswoman Rosanne Siino. "We need to keep lobbying to get rid of the U.S. governments 40-bit restriction on what can be exported."  Within the United States, Netscape sells products with 128-bit encryption.

That raises an interesting issue.  How difficult to use or how time consuming can a program or method be to be considered "a universal decoding device or program."  Can I give the feds a program that will crack my messages in a few days when run on one of their supercomputers?
If this is not acceptable what will be their rational?
Will they have to invent a huge new bureaucracy to manage all these devices and programs?  Theoretically, every person in the US could submit many different devices and programs.  One could bank on the feds losing or misplacing your program if they were innundated enough.  Can you destroy your only copy of the "universal decoding program" after giving them their copy?  Does every message or file I encrypt need a cleartext header that describes which of my escrowed devices or programs wil decrypt it? There are many problems with this idea of Government Access to Devices or Programs (GADOP).  A toolset that could build many different encryption and decryption variations based on psuedo-random input may be a good tool to fight this nonsense.

 Since Microsoft Corp. products are usually robust, I was looking forward to seeing what type of security features the company implemented in Windows NT Workstation Version 3.5. But after walking through the system with Microsoft product managers and developers, I was dismayed to find how woefully short on security features Windows NT is.      Despite the fact that the U.S. government is expected to certify Windows NT as a secure operating system, Microsoft's first serious venture into security is not very impressive. Windows NT may pass muster with the federal government, but it does not meet the real-world security needs of corporations running complex, heterogeneous networked environments.

Frank O'Dwyer sez:
Almost right -- it was the UK surveillance service (GCHQ) snooping on
Irish official traffic carried on US-supplied crypto equipment.
Apparently, the equipment in question had a "back door", courtesy of
the NSA; when GCHQ found out that the Irish govt were using this
equipment, they had only to ask their NSA pals for the details.
I only heard the details myself via a popular-science program on crypto

weakened algorithm, it may have been a set of keys from an key-escrow
repository or some such.

video  I think the large gray area here is the phrase primary purpose.  The primary purpose of a device is in the users mind only.  Videotape copying of noncopyright materials is done on a vast scale now due to home camcorders.  But even if only a few people had camcorders they should be able to purchase equipment that can be used legally.
Introducing the concept of "primary purpose" makes law abiding citizens suffer because some people are breaking the law.  If an item has any legal purpose it must be allowed.
This trend to take technology that *can* be used to commit crimes out of
the hands of citizen units is growing.  We see it with crypto export
controls and recently with the PA law and Federal law making it a crime to
posess devices and software to reprogram cell phones. When this doesn't make a dent in the number of these crimes I predict we will see licensing of technologies such as eeprom programmers, spectrum analyzers, frequency counters, and yes of course strong crypto.

This is from the Sept 11, 1995 Inter at ctive Week:
Netscape Communications Corp.'s freely distributed browser is getting commercial-grade encryption, making it safe to use in the U.S.  The change comes two weeks after Inter at ctive Week disclosed that the free version contained reletively weak encryption that had been cracked by a European user.
Meanwhile, in an as yet unannouced move, the company said it would place its commercial browser online for free downloading.  THat move apparently comes in direct response to an Inter at ctive Week article that highlighted the fact that all shareware versions of the browser contain the so-called 40-bit key encryption software which was recently proven insecure.  THe commercial version, sold only in the U.S. contains an unbreakable 128-bit encryption scheme.
Netscape said it received word last week that the State Department had cleared that version for release on the Net, but only within the U.S., owing to current export laws banning the export of encryption schemes stronger than 40 bits.  THe company could provide no details by press time on how it would ensure that the 128-bit version wouldn't leak beyond U.S. borders.
[end excerpts]
I love how Inter at ctive Week pats themselves on the back for making people aware of the problem. I guess the cypherpunk media hacking is working.  Doing things behind the scenes and making the press think they are the internet users salvation looks like a good tactic.
The cypherpunks forced a situation where Net users now have better encryption available to them.  I'd say this is a big win.

Excerpt for the web impaired:
     ``Zimmermann never exported Pretty Good Privacy, so the U.S. Attorney seemed to be missing the point. Unfortunately there still is no
     clear ruling from our government as to whether or not making software available on the Internet counts as exporting it,'' said Simson
     Garfinkel, who wrote a book about the program.      Zimmermann's supporters argued that without encryption, government could do widespread eavesdropping, perhaps for political
     reasons, scanning for words and phrases it considers subversive. They acknowledge that a few criminals may use programs like PGP
     to hide out in cyberspace, but believe that concern is outweighed by free speech and privacy rights.      ``The case was part of the government effort to crack down on good technologies for privacy. We hope the government's decision
     signals a rethinking of federal policy in this very important area,'' said Marc Rotenberg of the Electronic Privacy Information Center in
     Washington, an on-line civil rights watchdog group.      Others see the 2-year investigation of Zimmermann as intimidation.      ``It seems to me is that all the U.S. Attorney is saying is that they don't want the public relations nightmare of prosecuting Philip
     Zimmermann, but they still want everyone scared so that they won't exercise their Constitutional rights,'' Garfinkel said.

But take away the inputting of the credit card number via keystroke and the flaw disappears.  How would your program deal with a scheme like this?  Programs needing secure entry create a "secure entry field" which is
really just an imagemap with the digits (and alphas if required) placed
randomly about.  The user then uses the mouse to click on these numerals. Ideally the graphics that represent the numerals would be drawn from a
random pool and are misformed to thwart any OCR attempts. The graphics could be made even more difficult to OCR by mixing in words and pictures to represent the numbers.
An even better solution may be to have the imagemap generated by the server and just the mouse clicks sent back to be decoded on the server.  That is how server side imagemaps work now over the web.  It shouldn't be hard to take credit card numbers this way.

Under the Lotus plan, U.S. agents will be able to access the escrowed portion of the key but would still have to decrypt the rest to obtain a clear-text message.  Althought the NSA has not said it can decrypt 40-bit DES encryption, many postuylate that it can.
