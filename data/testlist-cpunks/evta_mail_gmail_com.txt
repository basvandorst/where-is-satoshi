@_subject: [cryptography] The next gen P2P secure email solution 
References: Although technical solutions are feasible, we ought to consider some things:
- Email is older than the web itself;
- Email has three times as many users as all social networks combined;
- Email is entrenched in the offices, many a business is powered by it;
Given the enormous energy necessary to remove such an appliance and replace it with something better. How could we make a secure solution that plays nicely with the current tools without disturbing too much what is already established?
