Given Clark's position, I believe it is a reasonable assumption.  Unless of course you hold that the Corp. as a legal entity could have a seperate position. In that case then WHO speaks for the corporation?  Some lower level PR person?  I don't think so.... Tim Cook, Mindsource(tm) Librarian.

I think you've made our point. He has to make that distinction at the time he says it, or most of us will ASS-U-ME it's company policy as well. Especially when the statement deals so directly with the company's product.

Find out if yours ( or any ) representative or senator voted for the CDA.  Send me email with the subject CDA-YES.  Put their name and where they are from in the body. I'll compile the list and post it.
When this is over they'll wish they realized how powerful the internet REALLY is.
Besides, what makes the US Congress think they have any control over a worldwide network?

That is a good point Mike. From a smart business perspective though you would want to ask current customers to send a list of the ones they read BEFORE you start dropping them.
