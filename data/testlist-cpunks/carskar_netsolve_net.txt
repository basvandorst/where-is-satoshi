How about a business case for relaxing intellectual property regulations? If
you could put together a good persuasive speech on that one, I would like to
see it. Or you could do a persuasive speech on the economic advantages of
more lenient cryptographic export restrictions. Or you could do what I did when I had that project in school (and this is my
personal recommendation) - blow off class to go hang out in the gallery of
the House, get there and remember it's tourist season and they are rotating
people through in five minute intervals, and decide to go downtown and get
drunk. I then had to deliver a persuasive speech the next day on why it was
more important to skip class and get drunk than to do assignments, which
didn't impress anyone and earned me a failure on the assignment. Or you could subscribe to the speech writing mailing list (I'm sure there is
one) and ask them.

It is possible for you to receive a freeze order that will compel you
to maintain referenced records. These orders (generally received prior to a
pending subpoena) can be rather general, so this generally serves the
purpose of preventing you from going on a shred/rm/wipe/degauss spree before
the authorities get what they want from you. However, I do know of at least
one case where someone challenged such a document on the basis that it was
obtuse. Can't cite off the top of my head, though. If you would like to see
some copies of documents that are generally used by feds to accomplish these
goals, let me know. I will see if I can neuter some for reference purposes.

FindLaw doesn't show anything for 'computer logs'.
Other than destroying them because they are evidence of a crime I am not
aware of anything that might require anyone to keep them. There certainly
wasn't any sort of requirement for folks like myself at the time of the CJ
trial to keep records for any length of time.
The flip side is that if you go around destroying all your logs as they
are made the security of your system comes into question.

Here's the source for the data preservation requirement:
Preservation is not a new idea; it has been the law in the United States for nearly five years.  18 U.S.C. 2703(f) requires an electronic communications service provider to "take all necessary steps to preserve records and other evidence in its possession pending the issuance of a court order or other process" upon "the request of a governmental entity."  This applies in practice only to reasonably small amounts of specified data identified as relevant to a particular case where the service provider already has control over that data.  Similarly, as with traditional
subpoena powers, issuance of an order to an individual or corporation to produce specified data during the course of an investigation carries with it an obligation not to delete or destroy information falling within the scope of that order when that information is in the person's possession or control. 18 USC 2703(f)
(f) Requirement To Preserve Evidence.--
   (1) In general.--A provider of wire or electronic communication services or a remote computing service, upon the request of a governmental entity, shall take all necessary steps to preserve records and other evidence in its possession pending the issuance of a court order or other process.
    (2) Period of retention.--Records referred to in paragraph
(1) shall be retained for a period of 90 days, which shall be extended for an additional 90-day period upon a renewed request by the governmental entity.

Yes, if you receive a subpoena, there will be information with the document
that instructs you on how to contact a clerk that will make travel
arrangements for you if necessary. The rule here is that they will
compensate you, or outright pay for, the cheapest method of transportation.
In other words, if it is cheaper to drive, then they will not pay for a
ticket. It does not mean that you will be riding in a goat truck or
something of that nature. Any additional expenses associated with testifying
can be indicated on a form that you will generally receive when you arrive.

When I was served with a subpoena in the CJ Parker trial, I had had a party the night before and let a friend of a friend sleep over in my living room. The process server showed up around 7:30 am the following morning and my houseguest let him into the foyer. Grr.
When I was subpoenaed in the Parker trial, I did not give any pre trial statement or affidavits or whatnot. (There's no incentive for me to do so, and presumably little incentive for list members to do so, unless they see it as a way to avoid further involvement.)

Agreed. My understanding of Hettinga's (and this list's, for the most

shortest path between two elemnts via increased individual capabilities and
reduced reliance on low-efficiency centralized control, as opposed to the
concept of eliminating or reducing centralized control in general just for
the sake of itself. I am only part of the way through the geodesic economy
texts, myself, but I like to think of the particular form of geodesic
architecture implied therein as incorporating some distributed
infrastructure as a means to an efficiency gain end. But then, I know fuck
all. Am I mistaken?

When Jews are murdering small children in reprisals against stone throwing by young men, and Arabs are blowing up school buses, then anti semitic statements against both Arabs and Jews become legitimate, indeed required.
Are you an anti semite, or are you indifferent to the murder of children.  Choose one.

@_subject: Questions of size... 
Comments below:
I would disagree with the supporting logic here. You could theoretically
that such systems were geodesic in nature if you really wanted to, but it
would be
due to the fact that there is a minimum economic distance (cost, perhaps) in
between participants. I don't think it is safe to say that these
transactions are canonically geodesic, unless you are also willing to propose that the
"surface" of the economic
structure is bound inseperably to the geography of the planet. I believe
that when we are talking about a distance metric associated with the structure of economic
transactions (we are
talking about transactions, right?), the most natural metric to be used in
economics would be cost. That's not to say that I have, at this point, read
any material
that makes a great logical case for the geodesic nature of the economic
transactions that
Mr. Hettinga describes. I am currently operating on a little blind faith and
a big hunch when assuming for the sake of conversation that Mr. Hettinga's proposed
transactions would
be reduced-cost. It just seems to make sense. I agree with you, Mr. May,
that a seemingly geodesic economomic system can be achieved through localization of the
market and direct trade. I do not believe that localization is a defining element of a
geodesic economy.
It seems that a broad move toward localization being in-efficient in our own
economy (one would have to prove this, and why), the concepts that Mr. Hettinga
proposes may
provide a working substitute for localization, by proposing a means of
direct interaction
between parties that breaks geographical limitations, and thereby reducing E.D. (economic distance). Again, one would have to prove that cost
is a
good metric for E.D., and then one would have to prove that Mr. Hettinga's
result in reduced cost in transactions. It's a tough case, but my hunch
sides with Mr.
Hettinga.

If I could find out where this stipulation is coming from and figure out the

don't believe I have ever heard one of those (the marketing favorite,

I remember running into a case where there was a system in place that worked

put a single employee in charge of the key. So then (not seeming to have
truly learned from their mistakes) they gave copies of the new private key
to members of the executive team. Then an executive left. I will not soon
forget hearing of thousands of pages of documentation being systematically
decrypted with the old key, and re-encrypted with a new key. The process
apparently took quite an amount of time. I also remember my squeamishness
about the fact that the CVS-like system was designed to encrypt and decrypt
on the fly based on some cheesy authentication, so as to provide a way to
maintain this system without having to talk to the key holders every time
you needed to make a change. The entire system was a big messy nightmare,
and when considered carefully, really didn't provide much in the way of
security. It would have been much easier for them to put a system in place
that required multiple people to sign off on a document for it to be
encrypted or decrypted. I took a lot of notes at the time on how I thought
this sort of system could be implemented... I should dig it up and see what
I was thinking.

I beleive it was Eric Hughes who at a Cypherpunks meeting about four
years ago, said "the solution isn't key escrow, it's document escrow".
Which makes sense- a business doesn't (or shouldn't) allow employees
to keep a single copy of an important document on their hard drive.
It should be replicated in other known places in case of disaster (drive
failure, stolen computer, employee hit by bus, etc).  Just because
documents are encrypted doesn't mean that this practice is abandoned.
One can envision a system where there's a corporate "document czar" who
is regularly given docs from various employees and who then encrypts them
in his own key.  When and where the docs get decrypted is determined by
corporate policies.  No key escrow required.
I don't know of any existing system like this, but formal corporate
document control isn't my field.

that the Republicans average roughly 49.85058296 and the Democrats average
roughly 47.27853081 on the Wired News scale, with one representative being
independent (Bernard Sanders), and one representative with an "A" for their
party designation (Spencer Bachus). Here's my Republicans vs. Democrats
breakdown of the Wired News chart:
Party  | Republican  | Democrat    |
     Again, it is entirely possible that my information is incorrect. I do
recommend that you do the research yourself, as relying too much on these
numbers means relying on numbers collected by a media source and in turn
sorted and re-calculated by some punk-ass on the cypherpunks mailing list.
     To the best of my knowledge, however, this looks right. What alarms me
is that though there is a slight difference in the overall score between
Republicans and Democrats, neither party has a very strong leaning one way
or the other, which illustrates the frustrations that a two-party system
creates for those of us who would like to see a strong stance (either way)
on the issue of government regulation of technology. I anxiously await any
speculation that might take place on this list regarding how Libertarian
representatives might have voted had they been in there, but the fact is
that we live in a two-party system for the time being, and if we feel
strongly about these issues, we need to accept that our representation may
not be hearing us. Is it because we aren't speaking loudly enough on these

At Wired News, we've compiled a list of the technology voting records of each member of the U.S. House of Representatives.
That meant picking seven tech bills and grading all 435 legislators -- at least the ones who showed up those days -- on their floor votes. If they chose to take a hands-off approach, they got a "1", while regulatory votes got a "0." (If you disagree with us, flip the scale around.)
Here's the list sorted by last name (scoll down to find your legislator):
   Sorted by score, with the two California reps with 100 percent at the top:
   And a summary of the results, with some methodology:
   Some interesting results: Purported privacy advocates like Democrat Ed Markey didn't score well, getting a 33% of 100%, in part because of his opposition to financial privacy legislation. Republican Bob Goodlatte, Internet caucus co-chair, got just 43% because of his support for speech and gambling restrictions.
The floor votes scored:
HR2031: A vote to restrict online sales of alcohol. (No is 1)
HR3615: A vote to create a new federal agency to spend $1.25 billion on rural TV service. (No is 1)
HR3709: A vote to extend a temporary federal ban on Internet taxes. (Yes is
HR3125: A vote to prohibit Internet gambling. (No is 1)
HR1501: A vote on an amendment to restrict the sale of violent material such as videogames to anyone under the age of 18. (No is 1)
HR10: A vote on an amendment to protect financial privacy by restricting government monitoring of bank accounts. (Yes is 1)
HR1714: A vote to allow the use of electronic signatures. (Yes is 1)

How do they subpoena records from garden supply stores looking for people
who buy too many grow lamps or hydroponic setups? Do they just subpoena all
of these stores on a regular basis? What do they claim they are looking for
in the subpoenas? My understanding is that you pretty much have to know what
you are looking for and be fairly specific about it in the subpoena. If you
do not already know who is buying "too many" grow lamps or hydroponic
setups, how do you structure the subpoena? The only signed subpoenas that I
have seen that were grossly general and unsure of what was needed were
either A) Internet related (taking advantage of a seeming lack of knowledge
on the part of judges) or B) a case where the person who is being subpoena'd
is actually a victim of the crime being investigated. Do you have more
information on the garden supply store thing?

Interesting - the article is a little confused on a few points - specifically, this is not the first time this has happened, the DEA subpoena'd records from a publisher of mushroom growing books back in the mid 90's. They also subpoena records from garden supply stores looking for people who buy too many grow lamps or hydroponic setups.
Also, it doesn't sound like they're talking about a search warrant - those aren't issued by DA's, nor do their targets have an opportunity to argue about what's searched prior to the search, because the searches take place without notice and at gunpoint. It sounds like they're talking about a subpoena, which does afford the recipient a chance to get an attorney and argue about it prior to releasing information.
Still, it's a good reminder that it can be dangerous to trust even good people with sensitive information - the good people may not willingly betray you, but they may be forced to divulge the information on pain of losing money, property, or their life, or it may simply be stolen by armed Greg Broiles

Scott and I have been discussing (from a theoretical standpoint) the
possibility of a third party that focuses on privacy and personal freedom,
and the difficulties in gaining creedence for this third party, as opposed
to the difficulties associated with influencing existing major parties
(either of them) to take a stronger stance on these issues. Assuming that
you could reconcile your differences with either Democrats or Republicans in
order to gain a strong Washington D.C. presence on a few key issues, would
that approach be easier than creating a viable "third" party? What
percentage of the voters do you think are holding on to a very few key
issues from their party of choice, and would be willing to vote for another
party that could give them equally strong representation on those issues?

Hi Rush,
I mentioned the "third party", inspired by my frustration with the two
leading parties, and their apparent lack of understanding about technology,
and privacy issues.
Some thoughts about the current parties:  Al Gore's populist rhetoric about drug companies which completely overlooks
the fact that we're on the eve of incredible discoveries and it costs lots
of money to research and bring new drugs to market.  Despite what Gore has
indicated, big pharma spends about 4 times as much on research as they do on
George W. Bush's hints at dropping the Microsoft suit (and the tobacco suit
for that matter.)  The recent Republican (I think) proposals to link Social
Security information to IRS information.
Our government is (probably justifiably) paranoid about attacks from
external and internal terrorists.  It is easier for terrorists to cause
problems than it is for the government to prevent them.  Each time an
incident happens, people call for more preventative measures, thus we have:
Secret searches (and bugging) of homes, no-knock entries, the Carnivore IP
monitoring system, etc.  Did you see the recent HBO special about extremist
groups and their use of the internet to encourage action by "lone wolf"
sociopaths?  Nobody wants to appear soft on this kind of crime.
Libertarians have some cool ideas (at least they sound cool), but I can't
imagine withdrawing all of our military force from the world and limit
ourselves to defending our borders.  Our enemies would have a field day.
Further, while I'm pro-business, I'm all for them playing "in bounds" and
only a strong referee can keep some of them from dumping PCBs at the local
The Reform Party is basically an old-time circus freak show, and I mean no
disrespect to circus freaks.
A number of issues are no longer "Right" or "Left".
So, back to your question:
The third party route would probably be very difficult.  It's not clear
whether it would actually dilute efforts to influence the major parties.  I
offer this hypothesis:  The way the system works now, with third parties
being excluded from debates, often excluded from matching funds, the
electoral college that makes for artificial "landslide" elections for the
major candidates... all of these things tend to squash the life out of any
third party.
I believe that people interested in the new issues are growing, and we might
find allies in unexpected places.  For example, my southern baptist friends
were not very happy with the long census form.
I have used the following techniques with some success:
Letter writing to congress still works.  I have written to other
representatives in the state if they happened to be the only one on a
committee, or even representatives for other states.    is an excellent example of publicizing issues
and encouraging people to write letters.
I don't think phone calls work quite as well, but I recall influencing an
issue in this way.  It was a niche issue, and I got some attention with a
careful explanation.  (The issue was:  For a while, songwriters and authors
were not able to deduct business expenses unless they were able to relate
directly to the song or work that was produced with that expense.)
One of my favorite things to do is write a short, punchy (often satirical)
letter to the editor.  Their paper starts out blank every day, and I have
yet to get one rejected doing it this way.  If it's a technology issue, you
might be the only one writing in on that topic, and thus more likely to get
in print.
Give money, either to candidates or groups like EFF or whatever.
There's some random thoughts for you Rush, and you can repost any of them if
you see fit.  Thanks for your questions!   What do you think?  What are the
most important issues in your mind?
  Scott,      Thank you for the link and the clarification of my info. I agree about
your assertion that a "third" party may better see to our concerns, but do
we think it would be easier to create a third party and give it enough
creedance to fill our needs, or do you think it would be easier to influence
existing party members to take a stronger stance? My assumption has been
that existing party members are not very concrete about the technology
issues. I don't think there is an old school party line in regards to
technology in and of itself on either side. Do you think that we can sway
them? Or are we forced to create a new party just to get an issue addressed
as we wish it could be? Possibly a harder question still is whether we could
live with either of the parties even if they did take a strong stance on
technological issues... Maybe a question for the entire list, but I didn't
want to stick your private reply up there without asking you. What do you
think, though?

Yeah, there is the Libertarian party, and they get a lot of electoral
votes. In fact, I think that our next president will be Harry Browne. Our
work is done. Let's go get a drink.      Seriously, what we are discussing here is the feasibility of
establishing a credible power base for a third party. I don't think (and
maybe you disagree with me here) that the Libertarian party has achieved
this at all. I don't think that the current Libertarian party CAN establish
this kind of voter confidence. The current presidential candidate for the
Libertarian party, Harry Browne, has done little to gain voter enthusiasm
with such bold and impractical claims as the statement that his first action
in office would be granting executive pardon to drug offenders.      I am familiar with the Libertarian party, to the extent that I was a
member for the past several years, and have attended several state and
national Libertarian party conventions, and spoken with Congress-people as a
representative of Libertarian interests. The fact of the matter is, in a
discussion of strong representation of issues within a viable Washington
D.C. power movement, you can only be bringing up the Libertarian party as
either an example of failure in the third party strategy or a recommendation
for a third party to endorse.      As for the possible assertion that the Libertarian party is an example
of a failure to succeed at activism outside of the two-party arena, I think
that any failure (perceived or real) may in fact be due to the outrageous
demands of the LP (as an activist, I have been embarrassed by them many
times), and the complete stubborn demand for overnight change without
compromise. These facets of the party may be sexy to guys like you and I,
but don't engender the public, or establish a foothold in Washington.      As to the possible recommendation of the Libertarian party as a viable
alternative to the two party system, I just don't see how that answers my
question. Sure, the Libertarian party seems to be fairly interested in
privacy and personal freedom. That still doesn't tell me whether you think
it would be easier to get the Libertarian party enough power to actually
protect our interests, or convince existing partisan powers to take up the

Are you guys still talking about the feasibility of a cipher that implements

Provided you were actually using the same key with each stage of the
encryption, then your system is only gong to be as secure as the key of the
first algorithm. In fact, it seems that if the key is compromised at any one
point, then the entire system is shot, given that you know the algorithm
(Kerckhoff's principle IIRC). Maybe I am misunderstanding. Rush Carskadden

o Long term protection is required (30+ years)
o You are in a position to properly secure the terminals at both ends
0 Efficiency is not a concern
For example, a chief of state's personal diary, an opposition leader's communications, best and final bids on large projects, etc.
In a way I see this question as how one should manage the transition from 3DES to AES. Does one keep using DES until the big day and then switch to AES? Or does a blended solution make sense in some cases?
While I think there may be a use for something like a Paranoid Encryption Standard in very unusual situations, I don't wish to waste more of people's time arguing with those who say there's no need for it at all. I don't have any compelling evidence.  It's pure I am really more interested in the theoretical "why not?" question, i.e. is there any real downside in combining ciphers in this way, besides efficiency?  Conventional wisdom seems to be more cautious than I think is justified and I am trying to prove that.

Glad to hear that all it takes to "get your vote" is a reckless
executive pardon of criminals that is designed to utilize executive power to
bypass the checks and balances system and negate the efforts of the
legislative and judicial branches of government (known in some circles as
"saying 'fuck the constitution'"). So to clarify (because I am completely
baffled), you are saying it doesn't matter what the outcome of any
legislative effort is at all? You seem to be saying that you are in favor of
voting on your own "concious" (conscience?) regardless of outcome. So when
they take every freedom you have, when your social security number is bought
and sold amongst governments and big businesses, when every facet of your
life is documented and displayed publicly, with any attempt at obfuscation
deemed illegal, you will say that it is ok, because you voted with your
conscience, and it didn't matter if your cause won.
     Of course it matters. At least to me it does. You may not agree, but I
would like to see my privacy and personal freedoms protected by the
government (in addition to my own strong efforts at defending them myself).
That is not the case right now, and the Libertarian party has done fuck all
to change it. So my question to you, posed for the third time, is whether
you think it is easier to give a third party (you seem to think that it
should be the Libertarian party, and I tend to agree with you) viability in
Washington with our efforts (or rather MY efforts, as you are quite content
to lose the fight), or whether it would be easier to convince an existing
power to take up our cause. I am not currently trying to start a third
party. I think I was very clear in my initial email about the third party
talk being theoretical. I am in no position to be in the business of
redefining political partisanship, and if I was, I would not have achieved
that position by asking opinions of people who assert that crypto anarchy
will make governments obsolete in the near future. In short, thank you again
for your Andy Rooney moment, but you seem to have abandoned the question
completely. Rush Carskadden

Well, that gets my vote!
Why should I vote for someone who doesn't stand for what I beleive
in just because the media says that they're "not electable"?
That's the kind of loser attitude that's gotten us a contest
that'll assuredly elect either an idiot (Bush) or a fool (Gore).
Unfortunately Americans are more interested in voting for a "winner"
than they are in voting their concious.   A "Libertarian Lite"
party wouldn't get the principled voters away from the Libertarian
party and wouldn't get any more mainstream voters than any other
third party gets.
But if you really want to do it, go ahead.  The cipherpunks list
isn't a very good place to discuss it though, as most posters seem
to think that the Libertarian party isn't radical enough, and besides,
crypto anarchy will soon make governments obsolete.

Cool. I have to think about this some more and see if I can provide you
with a proof either way, but for now you're right. I am operating entirely
on conventional wisdom. That is not sound. My assumption here (offered for
your opinion) is that provided a working knowledge of the actual ciphers and
a copy of the key (compromised through a weakness in one of the ciphers),
that I could use that same key, along with the respective decryption
algorithms, to completely unravel all of the encryption. Granted,
step-by-step analysis would almost definitely not include plaintext related
attacks (as deciphered text from one algorithm simply results in
unobfuscated text resulting from the previously implemented cipher), but my
knee-jerk reaction here is to think that if one could compromise the last
cipher applied and derive the key, then the entire scheme would be blown. If
this is the case, then the strength of the entire cipher is only as strong
as it's weakest link. On the other hand, I would think that some chain of
ciphers that all used different keys (preferably not derivative) would seem
stronger to me. At any rate, please keep me posted on your thoughts.

That is the theoretical question that I am asking. What you say appears to be the conventional wisdom, and I am claiming that it is wrong.  As long as there is some way to make sure that none of the ciphers in a chain are inverses of the others, or close to an inverse, in some sense, then I claim as long as one of the ciphers is strong, there is no way to get any information out about the keys from the other ciphers, even if they are all designed to reveal that As a practical matter, you may as well derive the sub keys from the master key using a one-way hash, but I am questioning the theoretical justification for doing that.  Massey and Maurer base their paper on oracles that give you the key for all component ciphers but one. I am saying such oracles cannot exist if one of the ciphers is strong and "inverses" of the strong cipher are excluded.

@_subject: authenticating Real Life(tm) - rhetorical bogosity 
to be reckless with logic, then you might be able to say that in a perfect
world, trust of the proof may result in implicit trust of that's proof's
application to an ideal (though this is technically flawed), but the trust
is not transitive, nor commutative. Trust of a proof may result in trust of
a proven concept, but the two are not indistinguishable. Further, the
colloquial connotation of the word trust, which seems to me to be the major
rhetorical nightmare here, appears subjective, and thus hard as hell to do
anything with from a logical standpoint. Attempting to make a shaky logical
argument about someone else's trust (in the colloquial sense) of anything
may indicate some properties of the subject's method of assigning trust with
which I am not at all comfortable. Defining trust in this sense would
require a massive amount of data from the subject, which I (for one) am
unwilling to collect. Might we, instead, ask the subject how their trust
differs between proof and protocol, and inquire about the potential
differences in trust assignments? Granted, this list is a bogon sink.

This still seems sketchy. I will take a stab at definition, and we can work
from there. Keep in mind that my definitions are rough draft and completely
off the cuff. Let us say that "trust" is the reliance of any existent upon the integrity
of any other existent.
Let us say that "integrity" is the state of subject when the value of each
element within the set of all observable elements of subject is a member of
the pre-determined element-respective statical set of values. Let us say that a "proof" is the evidence or argument by which an assertion
is shown to be true.
Are these definitions acceptable for the purposes of this discussion?
