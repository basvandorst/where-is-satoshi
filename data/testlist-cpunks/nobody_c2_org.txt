@_subject: A Helpful Tip for Impatient Souls 
Welcome back, Tommy, we missed you!  Hope you're enjoying your new (CSUA) "home"... (Time for everyone to update their "chain.ini" file, BTW.)
But Tommy ... if we did that, we wouldn't be able to read *YOUR* posts, either.  Perhaps anyone who had a fetish for "ease-of-use", or was troubled by even seeing "cryptographically INcorrect" ideas (the analog of "politically correct") would tire of Cypherpunks altogether and just read the party line from Sternlight and Co. (tm). The other problem is that if some brave, anonymous soul wanted to, let's say, "leak" the Clipper algorithm to the net, he'd have to forge e-mail from one of the "approved sources" above to gain an audience.
However, despite your anonymity, Tommy, don't I see your tongue firmly implanted in your cheek?  I sure hope so...  I find the posts from the "approved three" individuals highly informative.  OTOH, if *THEY* did as you suggested, traffic would be drastically reduced because it would only consist of those three talking amongst themselves.

I've taken the liberty of sending the text of the two recently-filed RSA
lawsuits to this list, assuming that most of you would be interested.  The text was obtained by scanning and then OCR'ing my paper copies, so you shouldn't be surprised to see an error from time to time.  Also please note that I've reorganized the footnotes in the interest of readability, as the page & section boundaries are not obvious in the OCR'ed copy.
You should be receiving the following three documents.  (Note that I have not included the Schedules attached to the complaints, which are quite voluminous, and are not really required in order to understand what's going on here.)
First, the Cylink complaint against RSA, filed June 30th.  This suit is very Second, RSA's relatively swift motion to dismiss the Cylink complaint, filed July 25th, and desire a hearing on or soon after September 9th on this motion.  This document and its enclosed memorandum of supporting points, written by RSA, is substantially longer than the complaint itself and is quite interesting reading.
Finally, I've enclosed an immensely interesting and in-depth complaint filed on July 26th by Roger Schlafley, which is probably the best of the bunch.

@_subject: cfs & remailers 
Collusion wouldn't be necessary.  If an interested party, such as a "TLA" were to follow the chain backwards, seizing the logs at each successive link, they could eventually find the originator of the message.  (This assumes that the logs were detailed enough to record each incoming and outgoing message, and match them up.)
It is useful against after-the-fact snooping.  If they're monitoring you in advance, then no, it wouldn't be of much help.  But let's say that someone were to anonymously post a portion of the classified Clipper algorithm to Usenet, with an indication that the rest was to follow in multiple installments.  There would be a very strong incentive for some TLA to attempt to trace and arrest this individual before the algorithm was further compromised, even if full-time monitoring of remailers wasn't already on their agenda.  If logs were not kept, or were securely destroyed often enough, then by the time the message came out in the clear, the data needed to trace through the early links in the chain would already be gone.

SUBJECT:  CRAY COMPUTER CORP. AWARDED DEVELOPMENT CONTRACT FOR CRAY-3/SUPER
          SCALABLE SYSTEM
  COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., Aug. 17 /PRNewswire/ via INDIVIDUAL, Inc. -- Cray
Computer Corp. (Nasdaq: CRAY) and the National Security Agency (NSA) have
entered into a joint development contract, valued at up to $9.2 million, to
produce a CRAY-3/Super Scalable System (SSS).  The CRAY-3/SSS will be a
hybrid high performance system that will offer vector parallel processing,
scalable parallel processing and the combination of both.  Under the terms
of the contract, Cray Computer Corp. will be paid up to $4.2 million for
development costs, and the Government will provide approximately $400,000 in
software consulting services.  The company is responsible for the balance of
the development costs.  In addition, the company will have rights to use
certain Government technologies.
  George Cotter, chief scientist for the NSA stated, "NSA selected Cray
Computer Corp. to develop the CRAY-3/Super Scalable System because of its
advanced technologies and the CRAY-3 architecture.  This is an important
initiative of the Federal High Performance Computing and Communications
(HPCC) program."  Chuck Breckenridge, executive vice president for Cray
Computer Corp., noted, "The CRAY-3/SSS will provide unparalleled performance
for many promising applications.  We are pleased to participate in this
transfer of Government technology and we are eager to help potential
customers explore and develop appropriate applications."
  This development project is based on a September 1993 feasibility study
recommending a hybrid supercomputer composed of a CRAY-3 and a large number
of Processor-In-Memory (PIM) chips, developed by the Supercomputing Research
Center (SRC: Institute for Defense Analyses). The SRC will provide
significant technical assistance in both the software and hardware aspects
of the system.  The Government's technology transfer program is intended to
maintain the country's technology leadership position by providing a cost
sharing arrangementfor development and commercialization of advanced
Government technologies.
  The high performance system will consist of a dual processor 256 million
word CRAY-3 and a 512,000 processor 128 million byte Single Instruction-
Multiple Data (SIMD) array.  This CRAY-3/Super Scalable System will provide
high-performance vector parallel processing, scalable parallel processing
and the combination of both in a hybrid mode featuring extremely high
bandwidth between the PIM processor array and the CRAY-3.  SIMD arrays of 1
million processors are expected to be available using the current version of
the PIM chip once this development project is completed.
  The scalable array will connect to the CRAY-3 memory interface and will be
addressable as standard memory to facilitate use of the SIMD array with
minimal delays for data transfer.  The PIM chip, containing 64 single bit
processors and 128K bits of memory, was developed by the Supercomputing
Research Center for NSA, and tested on a Sun/SPARC workstation with a
parallel version of the C language.  Cray Computer Corp. will package PIM
chips utilizing its advanced multiple chip module (MCM) packaging technology
that allows the CRAY-3 to operate with a record breaking 2.08 nanosecond
clock rate.  The PIM chips are manufactured by National Semiconductor Corp.
The CRAY-3/SSS is expected to be demonstrated in the first quarter of 1995.
After this initial demonstration, interested parties will be invited to try
out other applications.
  The CRAY-3 memory interface bandwidth will allow the application specific
SIMD array to provide dramatic performance improvements over existing
architectures for bit and image processing, pattern recognition, signal
processing, and sophisticated graphics applications. A notable strength of
the SIMD processor array is variable precision floating point for those
frequently occurring applications requiring less (and sometimes more) than
the standard 64 bit IEEE floating point arithmetic.  A substantial
applications base is available for the CRAY-3 and Cray Computer Corp. is
committed to working closely with customers to develop traditional high
performance vector and scalable applications.
  For suitable applications, the SIMD processor array option offers up to 32
Trillion Bit Operations per Second and provides price/performance
unavailable today on any other high performance platform.  The CRAY-3 system
with the SSS option will be offered as an application specific product and
will be well positioned in the evolving supercomputer marketplace.
  Seymour Cray stated that, "The CRAY-3/SSS development project leverages
the Company's existing technologies and accelerates our program to develop
parallel architectures and software to reach the TeraFLOPS performance
level.  I see a strong SIMD architectural component as crucial to a complete
parallel supercomputer capability."
  Cray Computer Corp. is engaged in the design, development, manufacture and
marketing of CRAY-3, CRAY-3/SSS, and CRAY-4 supercomputer systems.

@_subject: Cash, cheaters, and anonymity 
(my apologies if you've seen this twice -- whizzywig)
I thank Hal Finney for his thoughtful reply, and Tim May for
his excellent essay.   It looks like we can start to draw a stronger conclusion: there are serious holes in the assumptions made by offline digital cash protocols when applied to computer networks rather than manually operated smart cards.
Hal's comparison of coin theft to digital signature protection and repudiation is apt, but usually Irving only has one or a few keys to protect, while he might have thousands of coins, issued by
various banks.  I doubt digital signatures will ever be
used alone much for signing expensive contracts.  A
digital signature on an expensive contract, in addition
to being repudiable, will be suspicious, since if few people
accept such signatures as strongly binding (the initial
state), they will not be widely used on expensive contracts, and thus their existance on an expensive contract will be suspicous.  I predict it will become common practice, or even law, that digitally signed contracts over a certain amount are automatically invalid unless further precuations have been taken (signatures of notary witnesses, or perhaps some better crypto protocol designed for this purpose).
The trouble with offline cash in a network environment is that
the upper limit for fraud liability can be incredibly high.
If there are hundreds of thousands of vendors on the net, a situation CommerceNet predicts before the end of the decade, and they are using this offline protocol, then even with small transactions the fraud could run into the millions of dollars.  There's plenty of incentive for Irving to steal Jane's coins, run off to some place on the net that has no extradition treaty, and pump good change out of the vendors and into his Lichtenstein account to his heart's content.  We may yet find protocols to mitigate or limit this kind of fraud -- make change traceable if linked to double spending, do random
online checks as a cypherpunks poster suggested last year, or
similar precautions layered on top of the basic protocol.
But so far these problems haven't been put on the front burner
of digital cash design, and already we have people out there selling
offline cash on the network as a superior solution!
Reliance on law enforcement flies in the face of
cypherpunk goals, and indeed against the goals of good cops as well -- one of their most vocal complaints is about
people setting up systems that are vulnerable to crime, putting
them in unecessary danger.
It also goes against political reality to think that a startup
operation can lobby governments all across the globe to protect
a system that is ideal for money laundering and tax evasion.  Ain't gonna happen -- they'll let those "dirty money banks and money laundering net sites" rot; they may even give Irving a helping hand.
I disagree that "there is no excuse" for double spending.  If
the software is implemented badly (no fault of the user),
it might get mixed up with systems programs in such a way as
to cause double spending.  For example, if the system crashes
and one must recover from a month old backup, one has to
go through that old purse and determine which coins have been
spent.  If the software and/or user makes a mistake in this process, we get double spending.  If a network burps and
sends a vendor two coins where there should have been one,
we get double spending.  The possibilities for accident are legion and cannot all be foreseen.  "Shit happens".  A protocol that treats common
accident the same as criminal fraud, when the stakes are
so high, is pathological.
In the online system the consequences of double spending
(or million spending) are far more benign.  At worst
one customer is out stolen coins.  In a networked offline
system those same few coins are a potential loss for
every vendor on the net.  As Tim May noted, we may not even need to recongize fraud in online
cash -- just treat all online double spending as accident.   No bonding, secured accounts, investigators, ID badges
or cops with guns busting down Janes's door after
Iriving has million-spent her coins.  Here we both have a simple liability system and much less chance of fraud.
Tim May also suggested that most offline protocols are
intended for manually used smart cards.  This makes sense --
unlike an network environment with automated spending agents,
the scope of multi spending for manually used pruchases
in small amounts is quite limited.  On the network even
fraud of a few cents per transaction can quickly add
up to big $$$ across thousands of vendors.
What are the communications costs of online clearing anyway?
Don't credit card clearings cost about two cents per transaction
these days?  If clearing costs are less than plausible offline cash
fraud and fraud prevention costs, online cash is a winner,
both now and increasingly in the future as bandwidth becomes even cheaper.

Is the Nexus Bank still up?  Reference to it seems to have been removed
from the c2.org web page.  Also, what are the current money supply
figures for the various banks?   I, for one, would like to develop
for digital cash (perl, C, Unix, sockets, etc.) but I'm looking
for a bank that is commited to turning their barter tokens into an active
economy over the long term, so that I will have some choices
about how to spend those wages.
I think both service fees and the rebate are a good idea.  Two more good ideas might be :
- Loans, in NexusBucks, to independent developers of online services
who expect a future digital cash flow stream from their service
- Consumer loans to developers who expect a future wage stream
in NexusBucks
What is the best way to bootstrap the information services economic
cycle?   What is the minimal size of economy needed -- how many
online services, how many developers, how many skilled believers
willing to invest sweat equity to bring us to that pint?

@_subject: Making crypto use widespread 
One thing that's become apparent is that *convenience* is
all important.   If we made PGP much more convenient to
use, by integrating it seamlessly into our common offline mailers,
then folks would stop complaining about receiving encrypted
messages of a trivial nature, they would be much more
likely to sign their message, etc.  Getting the basic
functionality is only half the battle -- the other half is
making it so that the effort put into using it is less
costly than the value of most uses, which for most single
messages is slim.   Furthermore, we won't find the most
valuable uses until we've climed the learning curve by
massive experimentation with this software.  Small user
learning curves and low usage cost means convenience,
convenience, convenience.  Convenience is utterly
necessary to make crypto traffic mushroom.
Compare Nate Sammon's web page interface to the remailers
to the shell script interface (much less try to do the
encryption & nesting by hand) -- it makes all the difference
in the world!  Only one easily fixed problem there -- Nate's
remailer doesn't say whether it's doing the nested
encryption or mailing plaintext!  That one flaw, perhaps
just a tiny oversight, makes a system with almost nearly
perfect convenience much less user freindly.
(If it's really not encrypting that's a much bigger flaw,
but also correctable).  If folks fixed that flaw and
widely deployed Nate's server, remailer usage would mushroom, and we would have enough traffic to mix it up without long delays.
Why has Magic Money failed to take off?  It's very incovenient.  Far too much of the protocol is left
to the users to perform manually, and the command
line options as an interface are far too arcane, with
few affordances or strong clues as to the current state
of the protocol, or what action to take next.
This isn't a flaw in way Magic Money has implemented digital
cash protocols, it simply means that the software from the
point of view of users is incomplete -- soembody needs
to write a friendly client on top of the autoclient, and
a seamless anonymous messaging system between customer, vendor,
and bank.  This would make a huge difference in how many people are
willing to play with, and eventually use, the system.
Incidentally, Eudora developers told me at Internet World that they
plan to provide GUI hooks for PGP and PEM in a release due out
in late '94 or early '95.  This is easy for them to do, they just haven't considered it a high priority.  It is just not that hard for vendors to integrate encryption if they have customers
telling them that's what they want.  We as customers need to speak out to our software vendors and let them know what we want.
This is at least as important as political activism, probably

@_subject: Who Detweiler is *really* posting as 
Hello. I've been on this list for a long time and noticed some disturbing
correlations between Perry Metzger's and Detweiler's posts. Now, bear with
me on this. First of all, has anyone noticed how Perry flames Detweiler
with the most rabid virulence of anyone? But what is more interesting
is that his flames are always kind of lame. They don't have any cutting
comebacks. They're just filled with ad-hominem insults.
Now, if you recall how Detweiler was posting under tmp at netcom.com to the
newsgroups, he intentionally poisoned the reputation of one of his tentacles,
"Beavis Butthead", by having it hurl nasty insults, nasty words, and wallow
in degrading thoughts. That way, to ridicule a position he finds abhorrent,
he has Beavis take the position. An interesting "reputation cancellation"
effect occurs, quite like in Shakespearan prose when a slow-witted rioter
says, "First, let's kill all the laywers". Its a literary device.
So Detweiler, posting from Perry Metzger's addess as a "tentacle", is accomplishing several things. First of all, he hasn't been discovered since the inception of the list. And by flaming Detweiler tentacles so hotly, he maintains the illusion of being a distinct enemy, someone else who is repulsed by Detweiler stuff. And he's been more effective in starting massive flamewars
than Detweiler ever was. (In fact, when Detweiler was on the list under his
own name, they got into heated arguments over ridiculous issues no one
else cared about like "changing the cypherpunk name to something less radical").
But most of all, he has a "negative tentacle" to talk about ideas that he
really detests, and causes other people to detest by association.
Moreover: Have you noticed that "Perry" rhymes with "Larry"? And that "Lehman" (where he posts from) starts with "L"? And sounds a little like "madman"? Also, Perry talks about stock trading and digital cash. I think this reflects Detweiler's well-known interest in digital cash (he posted to the imp-interest
list for a long time). And Detweiler liked to smirk at Perry being the same as Parry, the paranoid AI computer program simulation!  I think he *built in*
this insult by design! It's his little "inside joke"!
Makes you wonder, eh? And has anyone actually MET Metzger?
I mean, of the people we can TRUST? He's in New York and has had NOTHING
to do with the CA cypherpunk meetings. And it's possible that the Metz
part of his name is just based on the NY Mets baseball team! Another
little "piece": he has been on the list forever, even when Detweiler
leaves (but always comes back). Detweiler is *known* to be drawn to this
list "like a moth to a flame". I think he was only *pretending* to go
away to start a flamewar while sticking around as Perry (and post from
Perry to help heat up the flamewar as he "left").
He reminds me of Sternlight. No one likes him. He has no reputation. But
he's immensely effective in starting massive flamewars. Detweiler loves
to hurl the ad hominem stuff all over talk.politics.crypto! Metzger
has *got* to be a Detweiler tentacle. It makes perfect sense. I've listed
far more reasons than those for Kragen (who I wasn't sure about).
I have heard of other reasonable-minded people leaving because of the
Perry flames, anyway. At least I hope the Perry-tentacle will tone down the routine scathing ad hominem face-slapping routine and posting lame drivel
no one cares about. Demonizing people rarely serves anyone's best interests.
BTW, I don't like what has been going on the list where there are anonymous
attacks on people in the list. Do we really want to bring this kind of
toxic rumormongering into cyberspace? If we had some reputation systems
our remailers would probably be less dangerous. In fact, that inspires
a Zen of Cyberspace joke:
Q. If a remailer is yin and a reputation system is yang, what is Yin without

Ironic what you say, Graham.  Given the fact that the subject matter is PORNOGRAPHY, often involving explicit depiction of sexual intercourse, which is somewhat of a "religion to some", maybe that's exactly what Nathan was asking -- for pornographers to keep their "fucking religion" off the net...
Just as adults can avoid reading what the consider "offensive" material, so can you, too, avoid lashing out in a blind fury at posts like this that YOU disagree with.  If one didn't know better, it'd seem that YOU are almost advocating censorship of ideas that you deem offensive.

Let's say I have a digital cellular phone.  I also have Anonymous Remailers,
PGP, and over 100 BBS numbers (structured for which day and which hour each
would be used) so that I can contact and talk to my "Friend."
Please tell me how the LEA's can find me and understand the transactions
between us? If I have several encryption programs, can I 'layer' each document [I PGP the
file, the I DES the PGP file, then IDEA for the final layer.
Does the NSA have to crack it one layer at a time, or can they bombard it,
crack the layers in whatever order the supercomputer finds?
If I am missing something, please let me know what I have missed.

Anonymous User scripsit
In the above scenario, I would never use my voice over the digital cellular
[and I would be always moving {nothing done at home}]...strictly PGP/E-Mail.
Even IF the parties are known, can they make their case? [How can they prove
X sent Y if using PGP and anonymous remailers?] Of course, if one of them
cooperates, that's different.
Can Tempest be used as I'm driving/on a city bus? How expensive is it to
maintain a Tempest surveillance in this fashion? This is a positive of
portable computers and portable communications..no one can pinpoint [even
remotely] where I'll compose/collect my pgp/e-mail. I am assuming that I'm
covering my tracks smartly, and the only thing they have is what they can
grab over the air, which is PGP, and that gets sent to some BBS [which they
don't know] for my friend to pick up.
The ESNs and the Keep Moving are really helpful, thanks.

GOVERNMENT WIRETAPPING, ENCRYPTION AND THE CLIPPER CHIP DEBATE
Thursday, September 29, 1994 4PM

The federal government says it is necessary to update America's wiretapping
capabilities to keep up with technological advances -- and that not doing
so could mean losing the battle against organized crime and terrorism.
Last year the Clinton Administration proposed the "Clipper Chip," a data
encryption plan which would put the "keys" for decoding phone, fax and
computer communications in the hands of the government.  The
much-publicized plan has met with strong opposition from privacy groups,
business executives and computer professionals, and has also been
challenged on technical grounds.  At the center of the debate is the
question of how to balance national and personal security concerns, on the
one hand, with the right to privacy and the need to maintain the
international competitiveness of businesses that use encoded
communications, on the other.  Recently, government officials have
expressed a willingness to compromise on some features of the Clipper Chip,
but the debate continues over what kind of encryption system should be
implemented and what role industry should play in the development and use
of a new system.  This forum brings together representatives of the FBI,
the computer software industry, and academic computer scientists who will
share their views and concerns about the Clipper Chip and alternative
systems of data encryption.

@_subject: This PROMISes to be odius 
Oracle should shange it's corporate motto to:
"Oracle, bringing Big Brother to life" or
something similar. The problem with this sort of
software is that it is virtually made to be abused.
It is very, very obvious that the profit motive and
the reassurances of LEO's have totaly blinded any shred of ethics the corporation might have once
My reaction to this is simple. In the 70's, it was
acceptible reasoning for computer professionals to
not work in certain sectors of the industry because
they didn't want to be a part of the "military industrial
complex". The 90's version of that is simply not to buy products
from vendors who engage in unacceptible practices.
Oracle clearly falls in this latter catagory.
I had been looking very strongly at specifying a DB made by one of Oracles competition due to experience
with it's nightmarish installation procedures, but this
pretty much clinches the deal where nothing else would.
The funny thing here is that since this is just a current
sale, and since there's allready plenty of technical reasons to look at competing products, I'd bet even money that over a relativly short amount of time I can offset ALL of the sales for this odious LEO
product alone.
I would encourage others to do the same.

The idea is simple. Since it is easy to increase the size of the

uneconomical to be a little overly paranoid over the size of my

Cpunks: I tried to find the perl script premail (v. 0.44) that is described at the Raph Levien's page. Unfortunately, EVERY place where it is purported to be is screwed up: ftp.csua.berkeley.edu does not respond to FTP commands, Levien's download page returns premail 0.43 instead of 0.44, and ftp.hacktic.nl does not have premail-0.44.

@_subject: Reasonable validation of a software package 
Fellow cpunks:
I am working on various software packages for UNIX and
Windows and since this is commercial work and prior NDA's
are involved, I can't include the source code for
absolute validation.
What would assure one that a package has not been tampered
with from the company to the user?
(Currently, I am using PKZIP's rather anemic AV protection,
as well as signing the archive with my PGP key.  I am wondering if there are any other steps I need to take to
assure that a package came from me, and wasn't damaged/altered/tampered with in transit.)
Thanks in advance.

Is there a possibility that the US version of Netscape 2.02 for
Windows 3.1 will be made available via this mechanism?
I run OS/2 in a WinOS/2 session under OS/2 Warp, and the 16 bit
version of 2.02 is the latest one that us OS/2 Warp users of
Netscape have been able to get working.  None of the 3.0 betas
will work, for some reason.
(If you have a "wish list" there, a native OS/2 version of Netscape
would be nice, too! )

This is very serious. Why has there not been more discussion about this on the list?
How close/far is this from becoming law?
If they are now trying to make it legal for the CIA and NSA to snoop inside the US  I would guess that it's happening already. Remember
wiretaps? Do it now and they will make it legal later.

@_subject: Hackerpunks and C2 
I think that the belief of the owner of hackerpunks that s/he won't
be discovered is somewhat naive. Even though your traffic analysis
ideas are right (see below), the most likely way to discover the owner is
his/her unintentional screwup. I just feel like monitoring traffic of all internet is too expensive.
Still, the secrecy of the location of the hackerpunks-owner is not such
an important thing (as long as the list is not located in some police
state not honoring free speech). The knowledge of said localtion is not even really important since the contents of this list may be
montored anyway by simply subscribing to the list.
[maybe I saw it on this list] How about this: that every remailer adds
a cookie of size X where
      S == size( message )
      X == 20KB - S + rand( 40KB ) if S < 20KB
      X == 40KB - S + rand( 80KB ) if 20KB <= S < 40KB
      X == 80KB - S + rand( 160KB ) if 40KB <= S < 80KB
and so on. This way, only 2-3 bits of information about size will
be available to traffic analyzers, instead of about 10-12. For the
most typical situation of messages being about 5KB in size, there
is no information leaking.
Of course, if an incoming message contained a cookie, it should be dropped by the remailer to be replaced by the new one on the next hop.
Same cookie feature could be added to premail.
Have fun.

Just read that the Supreme Court "struck down provisions of the 1992
Cable Act that require local cable companies to either ban indecent
shows from appearing on leased or access channels or place all
programs deemed indecent on a single channel and block it. Those
provisions violate free-speech rights, the court said. But the court
said Congress lawfully can permit cable operators to choose not to
broadcast such programs on leased access channels." [NYT]

@_subject: Happy shiny censors holding hands 
McPaper USA Editorial, March 21st, 10A:
Racism on the Net
Even in the wildest reaches of the Internet, where anything goes
and most things have gone at least twice, the flow of free
information is sometimes at risk.
Take this ugly battle: on one side, a band of racists wants a
formal place on the Net to discuss "white power" music. On the
other, a cadre of Internet users believes white power deserves
no such setting.
At risk is the wondrous anarchy of the Internets newsgroups.
These exist by the thousands in an Internet subject called
Usenet, where they are divided in two.
In the "alternative" category, newsgroups careen about
essentially without limits. In the other, qualified newsgroups
are organized into eight subject "hierarchies": politics,
science, etc. Membership in these is preferred because, for the
most part, these hierarchies are carried by the Internet's
networks without question.
In this case, a fan proposed that the "recereation" hierarchy,
which includes music sections, add a white-power newsgroup. This
would put the music -- and its central tenets -- smack in the
middle of the Net.
Then the fight commenced. Although the Usenet contains no real
structure, it is self-regulating. Newsgroups proposed for a
hierarchy are subject to a discussion period and then balloting
by interested Netizens.
In this case, opponents argued that white-power advocates
should hold their discussions in one of the "alternative"
newsgroups; that the hierarchies constituted a special garden in
the Net's "village green"; and that white-power music deserved
no bench there.
To be sure, racism deserves neither respect nor credibility. But
in this case, exclusion may have unintended results.
If offensive ideas by themselves are a basis for exclusion, then
who else should be locked out? Some would make the same argument
against the hip-hop and music-poetry newsgroups, where harsh and
violent rap lyrics may be discussed.
Without their own newsgroup, the white-power devotees will only
contaminate other newsgroups with their static. Give them a lair
to call their own, and at least you know where not to tread.
There are advantages to Usenet's ad hoc self-governance. It helps
protect the system from outsiders seeking to control its
carbonated anarchy. But if the system then turns against speech,
the result is the same: Free exchange of ideas is constricted.
Even in the ether -- especially in the ether -- that's something
to beware.

@_subject: Why I Pay Too Much in Taxes 
Nobody pays offshore for Mr. May. They pay a domestic corporation for his
services. The corporation pays Mr. May a sufficient taxable salary for his
domestic expenses. Anything above that (i.e. money that Mr. May don't need
right now) is paid to the offshore entity as (for instance) deductible license
fees. The payment should probably go to a jurisdiction with a double taxation
agreement with the US, like Holland or Ireland. In Ireland it's easy to setup
a tax free corporation that sends all it's income to an offshore trust, where
the money stays until Mr. May needs them.
They just deal with the vice president of a typical domestic consulting
corporation. That the CEO of the company is an alcoholic living on a park
bench (for the ultra cheep setup) is nobody's business. He's on permanent
vacation for all they care.
Only one individual and he's too drunk to remember anything.
Thanks, but I can afford Cuban cigars. I'm selling setup's like the above for
a very nice fee. And this is the kiddie version of serious tax planning. After
all, Mr.May would still pay taxes on his domestic spending.

@_subject: SMTP Server for sending to anonymous remailers? 
Does anyone know of an anonymous remailer that has an SMTP server
(hopefully unlogged) that I can specify in a special variant of the
"sendmail.cf" sendmail configuration file for sending mail to
anonymous servers?
I use a PPP connection, and right now I'm using my ISP's default
server and I don't like the idea of logs being kept, even though the
messages themselves are chained/encrypted.
Maybe I'm "paranoid", but if I wasn't, I probably wouldn't bother
with PGP, C'punk remailers, etc.

@_subject: Sendmail Question (was: SMTP Server for sending to anonymous remailers?) 
What settings do you use in sendmail.cf to accomplish this (sending
it directly)?  Is that the default behavior?  Specifically, what
goes on the "DR" and "DV" lines?  When I send mail from my PPP
account to my work account, I always seem to end up with a "Received:
ass-u-ming that if the host name shows up in the headers, it's
passing through that machine and is potentially being logged.
