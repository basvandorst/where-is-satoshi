@_subject: REMAIL: Anon. remailers 
One alternative would be to use the technology within its
own narrative..
If IP providers and other sysops are *annoyed* that an anonymous remailer passes "untraceable" email, why not
have a remailer that passes email with a trail of
encrypted SASE ??
That way, the identity of the person posting is preserved,
albeit not the physical location..
