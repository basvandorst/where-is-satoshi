Here's a thought,
While Java isn't a workhorse performance wise, it's very simple for anyone with a half decent browser to use java applets.  Writing an implementation of DES in Java should be fairly easy, however it will run slow on most browsers.  This performance drop will make it far easier for Joe Webuser to easily help break DES for us.
Previous efforts at breaking DES and RSA have done quite well, but the number of people involved can be greatly increased if you tell someone just go to this page and leave your browser on overnight, every night.
The applets would get a key range from the server, process them, and return a yeah or nay back for however far they manage to process before the user returns in the morning.
With JIT's (Just In Time Compilers) and the sheer numbers of users that this can attract, the efforts at breaking weaker cyphers can be increased.

Right, and Active X, if those machies were on the web, would not be Correct, however there is one thing you have forgotten... (next paragraph)
While ActiveX does support hand optmized assembler, there are Java JustInTime compilers which take JVM bytecodes and turn'em into raw assembler.  They aren't hand optimized, they are natively compiled code, but they are native code non the less.  A good optimizing compiler may not be 100% as cool and as fast as hand optmized code, BUT it'll be almost as fast.  And Java will run on just about EVERY platform out there.
And that is a bigger, more important point than a 10%-25% increase in power over non-optimized code.
Besides, I'm not arguing AGAINST an ActiveX client, there's no reason why there can't be both Java and ActiveX clients out there since there is both a compatibilty issue and a speed increase with ActiveX.

Forth!=Java.  Test it before you speak.
Sure it can, you just have to let your server act as a proxy and do a bit of work.  An applet snarfed over the net can only talk to the server.  But the server can talk to other servers.
Not as an applet, but as an application, sure.  Also why would you want a DES breaker to put stuff on the client's hard drive?  It's far better in terms of security - both for the client and for the server to store'em on the server.
In other words, you can't be lazy.  You have to write a good server that will handle some of the legwork, but leave the DES to the client.
Like I said - try it.
Or maybe Ray knows what he's talking about BECAUSE of that same implication. :)  As for inappropriate, ActiveX is inappropriate for most uses - any web page attachable code that when downloaded and executed can format your hard drive is inappropriate.  Regardless of performance.
Until Microsoft secures ActiveX in it's own sandbox and doesn't allow it to access things it shouldn't, it's not cool.
Anyhow, I will drop this topic here since it's becoming an ActiveX vs Java religious crusade and is inappropriate.

Simple.  Check out Windows NT, under NT you can write/run programs as services which log in as an account.  When you do this, that service program is limited to the security restrictions of that account.
If you're using the NTFS file system and give that account access only to one directory, it can't access anything but that directory.  (If you're using FAT, this isn't true and the program can read/write/delete anything it wants.)  Works quite well.
It can be done under 95 but Microsoft will have to write a Sandbox Virtual Machine (a Virtual x86 session whose API's are filtered to prevent access to certain things like the file system, and disables direct I/O.)  Not that easy under '95, but it already exists for NT.
The problem is how to deal with DLL's.  You don't know all features/functions of all DLL's.  It may be possible to write a DLL that runs outside the sandbox and can act as a proxy to the file system, so it's iffy unless you limit the DLL's and services that ActiveX apps talk to, and make them all live inside the sandbox.

To prevent ActiveX controls from formatting your hard drive while still being able to run native code to do fast DES cracking, why else?  Sandbox!=Virtual CPU emulator.  Sandboxes work at the supervisor/user CPU level deciding which calls are cool and which will result in a core dump.
Viruses can sneak into software.  Given enough time you will see them sneak into compilers which will then happily create virus infected or trojan loaded controls which will be happily signed.  I'll leave the test of that scenario up to your imagination.  There were cases of viruses making their way to production distributed disks back a few years ago because people weren't watching carefully enough.
Or you may find that shareware control authors won't bother to sign their
controls, etc...  Same situation.  At some point trust or no trust, once
your hard drive is wiped, so is the record of the signature that says "The
last control you downloaded came from XYZ.com and was written by Vulis." Right, so if that's the case, why would you allow ActiveX controls to run on your system?  It's the same problem whether signed or not as signatures only tell you the author's identity and not much else.

Which is what I've been saying; except for the impersonation feechur, you can do all of the above with a secure account.
That's funny, I could have sworn that services could log in as users.  Gee I must have been dreaming all along about the directory replicator which requires you to create a replicator user, and the scheduler service which though it can run as the LocalSystem account is better executed as another user with limited rights.  No, I must have been imagining them. And the services control pannel which allows you to set such settings, I've imagined that too. Gee I also must have imagined hearing that it's a bad idea to allow such services such as the scheduler to log in as administrator or LocalSystem account because then folks could run anything they like by using the AT command with the /INTERACTIVE switch.
Sure there is no sandbox, however you can easily install the RunAsService program from the ResKit and point it at MIE so it too runs as a limited access account which won't have access to the rest of your hard drives, but granted, if someone does use the Impersonate calls in the control, this isn't going to help much.
Welp, there you go.

And I'd be happier running the signed ActiveX control, written by Peter Trie, or anyone else within a Sandbox regardless of signature as it increases security.
You did however say this a few days ago:
"This thread branch seems to be based on bad assumption.  Why would
one want to run ActiveX controls in a sandbox?  If you need a sandbox,
use a Java applet, if you need native code level access to the system
use ActiveX."
The above says that you wouldn't want to run ActiveX in a sandbox while you would want to run Java in a sandbox.  The difference between technologies is that one runs native the other emulative.  I wouldn't want to run ANY foreign code outside a sandbox.  Java or ActiveX.
The whole point of this was creating a distributed network of DES crackers.  There is zero API security checking on a control that does nothing but math and integer operations.  The loss of performance occurs when the control or applet wants to read or write to the file system or tries to talk over the network, which a DES cracker won't do very much of, hrrrm?  In other words, an ActiveX sandbox will not slow down the DES cracker, and it will increase security.  What's your problem with it being used on ActiveX when you say it's cool to use on Java applets?
I back up my hard drives to CDR's.  While it is true that viruses can get into my system, I'd notice them quickly with the scanners, and if they did manage to wipe my drives, I'd have the data safe on CD where they can't write.  I don't store programs on the CD's, just data.
Precisely why you need to sandbox an OS.  A good operating system / virus
scanner doesn't allow programs to modify other programs, except for a
user approved compiler.  If you've ever used a Mac compiler and Symantec's SAM, you'll notice that if you enable certain features, you have to allow exceptions for your compilers - you as the user.
If a virus infects your compiler it is because you've allowed it permissions to do so previously.  (With my Mac, I have the virus checkers warn me, even when I compile. Yes, it is annoying, but it's much safer.)
How many users know how to download the jdk and run the java vm locally?  Yeah, all bets are off when you download an unsigned control, but having them downloaded into a sandbox means that even if they are written by VulisSoft, they won't damage anything of importantce.
It is not.  The sandbox runs in supervisory (Ring 0 for you intel freaks) mode, the code it allows to execute runs in user mode (ring 3 is an example) so no matter what the control does, it cannot get into anything the sandbox doesn't allow it to since it cannot switch to supervisory mode.
(Assuming you've implemented your sandbox securely and it lacks security At the same time, only I/O calls are hindered by the extra checking, so it's a moot point in the case of the DES cracker.
Now what you are saying is that if you don't trust the control, why should you trust the manufacturer of the sandbox?  The answer is that they are a highly more visible target for lawsuits than a possibly unknown author who wrote some control which you ran ten months ago that decided to wake up today and wipe your drive.
There's a big difference between protect the user wholy and presenting a dialog box where they can press Ok to download a destructive bit of code.
In one case the user is culpable for agreeing to download destructive code, the other prevents the problem from happening.
Also, the secure sandbox source code can be made visible (if such an entity as one that wrote it deems to do so in the name of trust.)  See pgp.  need I say more?  Would you trust PGP more or less than say Norton Whether or not you are qualified to analyze PGP source code isn't the issue, you at least have the ability to do so once you learn how.

Sure they can.  Get a file system that honors security and limit that applet's access to certain directories only where the data it needs lives.  Do not give it access to everything.  A sandbox will allow this.
Same difference whether you use the signature or some other thing to grant or revoke access to certain resources.  Though if you use a signature as in the author who wrote it as opposed to something like a CRC which is unique for every control - then you are opening a wider hole than you want.  With apps like that you want to set security perms for each application, not all applications that were written by Macrosoft. :)
Fine - how many game users who how to unzip the java classes into their classpath?  Question is of knowledge not of what action they will take.

As far as majordomo is concerned, - yes.  However, there are those who subscribe invisible and therefore wouldn't show up when you say "who cypherpunks" to majordomo at toad.com.
I will not argue on John's reaction since I do not know him, nor have I met him, however, the fact that Vulis posts and reads cypherpunks means he's still here.
If he had been ultimatly censored, shot, stoned, beat on, and cement-booted, he certainly wouldn't be able to post.  He's still here. So the above is bullshit.
It's not a question that he found a way to read from and post to the cypherpunks list.  He hasn't been prevented from doing so, therefore his unsubscription hasn't been enforced, so he's still here.
If before he was unsubscribed he was able to post messages and read messages, and now that he's unsubscribed he's able to post messages and read messages, what's the difference to the rest of us on the list?  As far as we can see, he's still subscribed.  Never mind that he gets his messages from usenet or elsewhere, he's still here.  There is NO difference to the rest of cypherpunks.

Let's see - since you came here, you posted many huge spams about various things, all of a sudden after your tiff with Tim, we started getting daily warnings about Tim May, followed more recently by daily warnings with ASCII art - in a recent message you responded to the question of ASCII art and thus proved your implication, the list has been getting much advertisement spam that starts wtih Fuck You Spams, and even more recently the list has been conveniently subscribed to several other lists, and now there is loop on the list caused by you.
I've been on this list since '93.  You've been here since what? early 96?  You're the first and only person to be kicked off the list officially - even Detweiler left by his own accord.

It's simple, if you are tired of this turd's posts, just send a message to PSI.  here's all the relevant info.
Don't bother sending complaints to postmaster at dm.com, vulis owns that domain so he is the postmaster of it.  However, to quote the last PSI guy I spoke to: "If he continues, it becomes contractual"  In other words, Vulis gets to find himself without a provider.

Only problem is that the Vulis^H^H^H^H^Hspammer could still mail flood the gateway dudes.  The gateway dudes should be ready for such attacks and should be able to handle them.
Such a flood could result in a denyal of post since if you flood someone with ten thousand random spams, then the posts worth delivering will get lost among those.  So the gateway dudes should be competent enough to deal with this sort of thing.
I wouldn't mind running such a gateway if it will fly and I have the time since I already provide this sort of filtering anyway.

Not only that, but what's the stop the anon users from claiming to be OTHER anon users and requesting tokens.
Say have one true user (Vulis) create 10 zillion tentacles and request 10 zillion tokens, one from each tentacle and then use them all to post spam?
Human review of posts is likely the only way.  Sure, some things can be filtered out, you can look for messages that are less than 1K in size and have the words "Timmy" "Mayonaise" "Maya" and various other derogatory terms nearby and reject them pronto, but that will only have Vulis change the spelling of those words slightly each day and have them show up on the list anyway.

You want me to crack your silly cypher?  Goading me with insults won't work.  Pay me to.  It'll cost you at least $8000 before I'll even bother with it.  and yes I have seen your page. It's supposedly "pseudo code" but looks suspiciously like Visual basic.  Learn a real language!
Give me the full cypher source code in C or C++ and a check for $8000 and I'll take a look at the holes.  If not, quit pissing on this list.  Cypherpunks get paid for their work and time.  We don't crack cyphers for free.  I recall the last time you offered your company to whoever cracked your lame ass cypher - it was cracked, but how come your company still is owned by you?  Nope, goading and insults won't work.  Pay me up front and THEN I'll crack your weak stream cypher.

One of the things you folks are missing is that this list is crypto-anarchy friendly.  Anarchy isn't chaos, it's self rule.  One of the things that us anarchists do is to deal with problems like Vulis.  The usual methods are to flame back, to ignore, etc.
If the problem doesn't go away, then we'll make it go away.  Those who have the ability to make it go away will.  i.e. the folks that have control over the list server.  And that's the beauty of it.

Simple.  Go back and read the Constitution of the USA.  You have the people carry arms and form militias which only act in the defense of the land if need be.  If the people carry arms, they can't be overthrown by a gun toting forceful government with such ease as you suppose.  The most civilized societies are those where everyone is armed.  You'd be surprised at the amount of politeness this encourages.

So, by virtue of declaring "this" area as a Drug Free zone, are they declaring other areas drug-unfree zones?  Does this legitimize the use of drugs in other zones? (could be an interesting flow of logic, only it's doubtfult it would hold "But yer honor, there was no sticker saying it was a drug free zone, so that means it's okay to do drugz" :)
So what happens if you're just hanging out and aren't doing drugs, say two guys wait for their friend or something, and have no drugs on them but don't disperse?
Can there a lawsuit be there against the officers who would arrest them for wrongful arrest?  (probably not)

Prove that he's doing it.  You're pathetic.
Actually, unlike you, I do feel sorry for you, for you truly have no life
and have nothing better to do than to start flame wars and such.  Do
yourself a favor, get a real life.  Go get off your fat ass and do
something with yourself other than masturbating.  All you seem to be able
to do is to hide under your doctorate and badger this list with your crap.  Maybe take a yoga class so you can do what you claim Tim is able to, and maybe you'll get a blow job that way...
And how pathetic are your daily warnings about Tim anyway?  Looks like your pots are blacker than your kettle, oh lord slackbladder!
As for Tim, this list wouldn't even exist had he not gotten involved with it in its conception.  How would you know the difference anyway, you weren't here back then, or were you?  Perhaps under the name of Detweiler?
You wouldn't know what a life is if one came up to you and bit you on your
ass. Oh tell us oh great one, and what is it that you know?  But spare us the flames and hate.  We already know that you are an asshole, of that there is little doubt.  What is at doubt is your degree, or is it a pedigree?  Shower us with your knowledge if you have any, for it is apparent that dazzling us with your bullshit isn't working.
And what by your definition is your level of life if all your output seems to be nothing more than flames and flame bait?  How much of a loser are you to resort to anonymous daily warnings about Tim?  Just how off topic and stupid was your message when you posted it?  Just how many plates of pork and beans do you eat each day to keep up your innane level of flatulence?
Apparently that "Doctorhood" of yours is good only for masturbatory self
congratulations, and when nobody pays attention to it, you turn around and
put others down so that in your oppinion, such as it is, you come out
smelling like roses.  Buddy, I've news for you, you aren't fooling anyone. You are the total absolute embodyment of shit.  No, before you
congratulate yourself on your achievement of shithood, you aren't even
even human or dog shit, no.  You are the essence of amoeba shit.  The
lowest of the low. You've a long way to go before you will ever achive the status of high human shit.  But I must admit, you certainly know how to strive for that goal.  It's too bad you'll never be more than low grade microscopic shit though.
And for that, you have my deepest condolances.  At least I hope this comforts you in your lack of life, for assuredly you haven't much of one.
At least at a minimum, if you get nothing else from this message, you'll get a tenth of an ounce of pitty.
But keep trying, I know it's hard, maybe if you try hard enough, you'll achive insect shit, perhaps even horsefly shitdom.  I believe in you Vulis, I know you can do it, come on, aspire to achive fly shitdom. :)
And maybe someday, if you are really really good you might even achive rat shitdom.  Then we'll be real proud of you for being rat shit, but until that time, strive hard and work long hours.  Hey, and when you reach rat shitdom and become emeritus ratus shitus, we'll throw you a party!   + ^ + |  Ray Arachelian    |FL|       KAOS KERAUNOS KYBERNETOS      |==/|\==

@_subject: Netscape Show - Security API 
I was at the Netscape show and attended the Security API.  Looks pretty impresive.  The slides for this should be available a week from now on  (?) for those interested.
This will be available in Netscape 4.0
Everything is a plug in module, and you can even replace the crappy DES and crippled RSA mods with stronger ones and even write a PGP signature checker/signed/encryptor, etc for both server and browser.  Very cool stuff. PGP was actually mentioned!
Catch is this: the international version is again crippled, however it is interesting to note that they got a module loadable crypto API to pass ITAR.  They did this by having the international versions check modules for signatures that say "US Export Allowed" :)
Possibilities around this (not that I am advocating any, just restating
what was said): export the USA version (of course breaking the ITAR),
modifying the code that checks the signature and allow it to load any
module, making a DIFF file between versions and exporting that (would this
be legal?)
They mentioned (someone asked) that the signature authentification methods that check a module are part of the same API, but hinted that they couldn't be overridden.  This could of course be tested, and hopefully they can be disabled. :)  But time will tell.
There was also some talk of expiring signatures - not sure if it was regarding modules or mail or key certificates.  If module signatures expire every six months that would make an interesting situation.
In the USA, you can write any module to do anything!  Would be cool to have a Netscape Mail PGP set of modules!!!  This could indeed solve the problem of having software that's secure and yet also easy to use.
What sucks is that someone in England couldn't write their own plug in modules to get better crypto for use in the international versions.  Perfectly legal in the point of view of international laws and ITAR, but crippled!  Netscape says they won't sign non-USA produced crypto modules for the international versions -- or at least that was the message they gave.
The folks at Netscape said that the US Government (NSA wasn't mentioned) did not want the situation to exist that someone from outside could build stronger crypto and have it be imported to the USA... Looks like we have an Iron (Crypto) Curtain situation here.  In the end
the USA suffers since we are only one country, but I won't start ranting
on that here since it's been discussed to death already. :)
Several folks from outside the USA, one guy from England actually did express concerns at this problem.
Some of the authentification methods they were showing were smart cards and such, and one of the comapnies there was giving eval models out!
Litronic had a couple of models - one a serial port one (9600 only with 512 bit RSA, also 768 bit, 1024 bit models will be due out in mid '97) the other plugs right into the keyboard grabbing your keystrokes before they reach the application! If you need eval models for your company to do development call'em at 714-545-6649 or go to contact them at litronic.com, whatever. :)  The serial port model is likely to be the most useful since it (should?) work on PC's (Running Linux too!), Suns, Macs, and even C64's. :)  Not sure if the API for this is software or an RS232 protocol, if the latter, these will work with pretty much anything.
Not sure how trustworthy they are, after all you can't disassemble the
smart cards and check their properties to make sure there are no holes,
but possibly a dual method would work.  That is, send a message to the
card, have it sign or encrypt the message with the private key, take that
signature/encrypted message, and also ask the user to type in a second
passphrase (or use the same hashed differently) that's handled on the
local machine.  If the user has both, even if the card is crippled, you
are secure, and even if someone finds the card they won't be able to use it. (I won't go into rubber hose key recovery here or any other details, see Tim C. May's excellent Cyphernomicon if you need background info on Over all, the message I got from this is that Netscape is doing the right thing, they are for strong crypto - but are forced to abide by the ITARs.  They are for voluntary key escrow for companies, NOT mandatory key escrow.  They'd like to provide strong crypto functionality to all and would if not for the ITARs.

I don't debate what Tim May has posted or not.  His value to this list far outweighs yours.  I debate that what you are posting here in this thread is nothing more than flames, and therefore off topic.
My ancestors are not a topic for the cypherpunks, and if you go and read
messages sent by me your way have zero refrences to your ethnic
background.  Your racially loaded, "dandruff-covered" vitriolic flames
have no place here.  However this is totally irrelevant since the subject
is off topic. As for "censorous flamer" you sir have done plenty to make my filtered list thrive.  I have received by far more new subscribers to the filtered version than ever before.  Why?  Because everyone is tired of you and your silly flames.  Were I mercenary enough to charge money for the filtered list, you, sir would have made me a rich man.
However, you are doing nothing to hurt me in any way.  I don't care what your oppinions are as to my ancestry, nor do I care to satisfy them one way or another by answering your cretinous flames.
Other than to point out that you need some serious growing up.  I've seen 3 year olds more mature than you Vulis.

Lesse now, you must be projecting. After all, you were invited to speak in San Fran, you declined backing out as only a coward would, not outright "No" but rather "When I have the time" and refused to plan this ahead, even months ahead.  Yet, you seem to have plenty of time to flame here, so you really have lots of free time - to flame and be cowardly.  And your ignorance is legendary around here.  You ignore netiquette and flame and cause flame wars and spam.
So what do you contribute other than copyrighted news postings and huge flames, and do so without the author's permission? Or do you have their written permission?
I have been on this list since 1992 and can attest to the fact that the above paragraph which you have written is false.  I have seen more personal attacks, flames, racial prejudice, and lies from you than from anyone else on here.  I guess you are of the belief that if you lie in every message about someone violently enough, eventually someone will believe your bullshit.
That someone isn't me Vulis.  An asshole is an assole, and you sir sure fart like one.  Get off this list.  Take your shit elsewhere, we don't want you here.  Be gone!

Right.  How many "crawzy Russians" messages have you seen from me?  If I've attacked you, it's your cowardice and your spamming that I've attacked.  Show me a message I've posted that attacks your ancestry?
Nice try.  Assassination Politics have little to do with your masacres, and I am not about to bring up the earlier massacre of Armenians by Turks.
There is of course a second side to every coin, but of course you fail to report on that, because your reports are of the yellowest form of journalism.
It is indeed a nice try, but all you are doing is posting spam news postings which are copyrighted.  And again, you didn't answer the question of whether or not you received permission to copy those texts and post them on line.
Had you brought up the question of how this applies to assasination politics, you might have gotten away with some of it, but alas, you didn't think of that until now
Next question - if that stuff has any relation to assasination politics, why didn't you bring it up until now?  Possibly because you needed some reason to justify your flames, right? :)  Your excuses are very very thin Maybe so, but you are the reason they have joined my list.  Doesn't that just warm the cockles of your heart?  You are actually helping my filtered list with your cretinous flames and spams.  Doesn't it make you feel good?
Judging at how you like to send 48Kb spams every once in a while - technically not written by you, yes - you seem to have a lot more racial prejudice than you would like others to believe.
Again, where did I bring up your ancestry?  And where did you bring up mine?  You seem to have little tiny balls, and one way you inflate them is by claiming to have been racially snubbed, but the truth is you are attempting to damage my reputation with racial slanders.
Tell me Vulis, and prove this, in what way am I responsible for the single death or maiming of any person?  Show us the evidence.  Not your flamed news postings, but real evidence.
I was not born in the region where that war exists, I never lived there.  In fact, my parents weren't even born there.  You see Vulis, my grandparents left that scraggy piece of land called Armenia while their families were masacred by the Turks.  So how is it that you claim that my ancestors and are responsible for wars going on now when they weren't even anywhere near it?
You also insinuate that by extension I am responsible for attacks against Muslims and Jews.  That too is slanderous and racist, as racist as any attack you claim has wronged you.
I'd call that accusation and lack of proof slanderous.  What do the lawyers on this list think? Hrmmm?
And why not?  If you libel my name, it will cost you. And that's not libertarianism, it's capitalism.  Just as trademark infringement and copyright laws are settled through money.  (Speaking of copyright, you've yet to prove written permission for your repostings sir.)

If that's the case, then why are you posting anti-Armenian flame spams? Your pots are blacker than your kettle?
The above paragraph is clearly slanderous.  Up until now you've danced around it.  Here you clearly state and implicate me in your racist remarks.  Congratulations, you can now be sued.  As for Californian, you've another thing coming.  I'm not in California.  You might be very
surprised to find out just where I live.  But don't worry, you will have to deal with this in a court of law.  Have a nice day Vulis.
So there you have it folks, a clear and outright slanderous remark.  We have lawyers on this list, who wants to hang Vulis out to dry? As for his previous remarks, I've saved them too.  There's more than enough to get a nice tidy bunch of bucks out of him, I understands he runs D&M consulting, right?  I'm sure his business makes a tidy profit, so there's a nice go there.
That's because you're not a crypto person and have no clue as to who are.  I'm not about to sit here and trumpet the things I've done for crypto.  Neither will Tim.

@_subject: Cypherpunks Lite Info Here. 
Very well, I will be lazy, and post the info out of my help file.  Enjoy. :)
Help is here! Hi there, as requested, here's some info about the filtered cypherpunks
list which I run (by hand with the help of a couple of mailbots)
This list is NOW running from: sunder at brainlink.com.
Basically, I use the 'bots to keep the list of recipients, then forward
any message to this list of usernames which I find interesting, and
usually noise-free... Since, I do this by hand, AND since there is no majordomo mailing list
software, and since I get a lot of mail, it's a good idea to make sure the
subject of any messages you send to me stand out.  i.e. make the subject
line:     "***000 Personal junk mail for the human, not the bots ***"
(The 0's are there to make sure that when Pine sorts the messages on this side, they come up on top, making sure I'll see them immediatly.)
There is no automated filtering of any sort...   Whatever message I find to be interesting, news-worthy, or technical (theoretical crypto, actual code, etc) gets handed over to the bots, which send it to this list.
If you use some sort of filtering program to move messages to a folder, look for the string "FCPUNX:" (without quotes) in the subject field.
There will usually be a propagation delay of one day to a week days -
sometimes as long as two weeks between the messages on the actual
cypherpunks list, and this filtered one.  This is because I may not always
get the chance to log in every day, and also because I may have to wade
through tons of noise/spam/flames from the real list. :-)
Occasionally, if I see something interesting from another list (such as
Cyber Rights, coderpunks, etc) I will forward it here if I feel that it
pertains to Cypherpunk interests, or that you'd like to see it. You should unsubscribe yourself from the real list by sending an
"unsubscribe cypherpunks" message to majordomo at toad.com - that is send a
message with no subject and just that single line - no signature either,
so as to unsubscribe.  - Unless you wish to continue to receive messages
from the real list as well as copies of those messages from here. :-)
All filtering is again according to my whims so if you dislike what I send you, sorry.  I might eventually work something out where this list will be broken up into many tiny lists so you'd subscribe to whatever subjects you're interested in.
This is a free service, no strings attached, just tons o'mail, but less mail than the unfiltered list...
Also note that the bots I run may sometimes be slightly buggy and may do unexpected weird things.  Appologies in advance if this happens.  But please by all means do report any such runaway bot occurances.
If you wish to unsubscribe yourself from this list, just send a message with the subject "unsubscribe fcpunx" (no quotes) and the next time I log in, one of the bots will handle the ubsubscribe.
You can re-subscribe yourself as many times as you like, you'll only get
one copy of each message, but as many copies of the request response as
you've sent.The 'bots hone in on your address and send mail only there, so
subscribe yourself from whatever account you want to receive mail. If by accident you subscribe from two different machines, the bots won't know the difference and you'll get two copies of each filtered message, so be careful.
This also means that you can only unsubscribe yourself from the same
address you subscribed from.
To get help, send a message with the subject "help fcpunx."
To subscribe yourself (if you see this, you are subscribed) send a message with the *SUBJECT* "subscribe fcpunx"
NOTE: THE BOTS ONLY RESPOND TO THE SUBJECT LINE, NOT TO TEXT IN THE BODY OF YOUR MESSAGE!
The bots only look at your message's subject and your mailing address so it doesn't matter what you put in the body.
Whenever the 'bots honor a request from you, you'll see a response mailed from them (under my name.)
Since the bots are only active when I log in and run them by hand, the message acknowledging your request may take several days to get to you.
*ALL COMMANDS MUST BE SENT IN THE SUBJECT OF THE MESSAGE!  The body (text) of the message are ignored.
Commands available:
 subscribe fcpunx           - subscribes you to the list and you are                               visible to fcpunx who requests
 subscribe invisible fcpunx - subscribe but don't let others know
 digest fcpunx              - receive the digest version (visibly)
 digest invisible fcpunx    - receive the digest invisibly
 unsubscribe fcpunx         - unsubscribe from the list or digest
 undigest fcpunx
 who fcpunx                 - receive a list of (visible) subscribed users
 help fcpunx                - sends a help file (you're looking at it)
If you're already subscribed to the list and want to switch to the digest version, you can do this by sending a digest fcpunx message; the reverse is also true.  Notice that you cannot subscribe to both the digest and the list.  Sorry.  If you'd like that feature either use two different accounts to receive them, or complain to me and I'll add it in.
The unsubscribe and undigest commands do the same thing, they take you off the list no matter which version you're subscribed to.

Yep, matter of fact that's what the light versions of cpunx are for.  's matter of fact I happen to run one of them and my subscribers are happier without all the noise and flames here.  :)  as for me, I don't mind the noise or the flames, I tend to hit the "D" key quite often. :)
( to subscribe to it, send a message to my address with the >SUBJECT< "fcpunx subscribe" or "fcpunx help" for help.)
Especially since Cypherpunks isn't the only list I subscribe to.  I go through about 200-300 messages a day, and 80% of them get delted without a single look.  I tend to read the 1st few messages of a topic, and if it's noise, it gets axed. :)

Another thing you can do: generate huge key pairs all day long and submit them to the NSA.  If enough people do this, they will be flooded and overworked, of course they may ignore them, etc, or make it hard to do so, but if everyone generates a 4K key every hour or two and discards it, but gives the key pair to the NSA anyway, they will run out of storage space, or at least it will make it much much harder for them to figgure out which key you are using for conversation X.
You can also generate a lot of /dev/null traffic by sending encrypted random garbage through remailers signed and encrypted with those random discard keys - apparently to yourself - but instruct the xth remailer in the chain to just drop it.
Make it hard for them to know which of your 10000 keys is the one you truly use. :)
This assumes many many things: like you are allowed to generate your own key, you are allowed to make the submissions electronically to the NSA, etc, so caveat emptors are all over the place here. :)  Still, it's one  + ^ + |  Ray Arachelian    |FL|       KAOS KERAUNOS KYBERNETOS      |==/|\==

This is wonderful in theory -- and in practice up until now, but what happens when someone decides "Oh, I hate this list and Tim, let me write a spam bot to anonymously spam the this into oblivion?"  There is such a thing as denial of service via spamming.  It's quite easy to do for someone who knows how to run sendmail and knows how to write a shell script or a small program.  Hell, I could write one of those in less than 1 minute.
As for me being banned, I doubt it, I'm not posting daily Tim warnings and such spams.  yeah, banning someone off the list for their political or even crypto views is silly.  Banning someone for spamming is another There is no reason we can't allow posts from those who are not subscribed to the list.  There's also no reason that we can't have someone moderate those posts before they make it to the list to remove the spams - mind you not to moderate the contents, but to remove repeating annoying spam and advertisement.
As for me, I don't personally give a shit, for as long as assholes like John Anonymous Mac keeps posting "Tim Warnings" I get more users on my filtered cypherpunks list. :)  But it's getting really old.

Thanks for the correction of that typo, yes, that should be >badly< not nadly. :)
If "Dr." Dimitri Vulis, aka "Vebis, The Great Spamholio" can work for the KGB, then it is no wonder that Russia fell apart.  Then again, the word is that the NSA's human resources department hire by the same guidelines. Care to share what you know about this?
Gee Vulis, I didn't know you were Armenian!
Like I said, badly written chimp code, what else can be expected from you?  If indeed you wrote that code; more likely you snarffed it off some usenet group.  Its text smells suspiciously of an old IBM PC (yes, PC as in the predecesor of the XT) program called nSults.

---------- Forwarded message ----------
Theoretically, for a "complete" brute-force attack on the DES hashes we need to consider a 56 bit ( 7 chars x 8 bits) password space. This space is the maximum we have to worry about because of the 14 char password to two independent 7 char DES keys split. The timing overheads of checking both the 8 char hashes during a brute-force attack are relatively trivial.
Now the crunch. Theory is fine, but in the real world there are constraints on the password space - in reality it gets much smaller e.g.   1) chars below 0x20 can't be entered in the password dialogue box   2) alphas are uppercased prior to being used as DES keys so you      can also ignore 0x61 to 0x7A. Correcting the case of any alphas      after finding a LanMan password is a quick and relatively      trivial task using MD4.
That much is guaranteed even if you (reasonably in 99.99% of cases) start throwing away characters that are difficult to quickly enter on a keyboard e.g. anything that needs an ALT-0-nnn sequence to enter (more or less everything above 0x80 subject to country).
Finally 3-4Gb disks are now relatively inexpensive so the amount of diskspace required for a precomputed attack is not much of an obstacle. It has been also been suggested that if you are short of diskspace you could always keep sequentially sorted sections of the precomputed file on a backup tape. Then, as you mention above there is compression. My main point is that you don't need an exceptionally fast machine or impossible amount of disk space. If I can write code to do this then you can guarantee that other people have, and that theirs is both cleverer and runs faster ;-)
"Greater password complexity" is a good idea for many reasons but not much help in this specific case. The LanMan hashes are simply far too easy to attack and you should concentrate your defences in preventing access to them. Finally, we need to put this in proper perspective - this attack and the associated IE 3.0 SMB and NTLM problems can EASILY BE AVOIDED with a few simple network administration policies.

Windows NT 4.0, with Microsoft's Client Services for Netware, or
Novell's IntraNetware Client for Windows NT, writes plain-text user-id
and password information to PAGEFILE.SYS.  The user-id and password
apply to Netware, however, users commonly use the same logon information
for both NT and Netware.  It is possible to then recover the plain-text
information by using a disk editor.
Tests have been performed  (with more pending) on these systems:
Windows NT Workstation 4.0 w/SP1 and IntraNetware Client for NT (970214)
     Pent. 133 Laptop  24MB RAM  50MB PAGEFILE.SYS
Windows NT Workstation 4.0 w/SP1 and Microsoft Client Services for
     Dual Pent 166   64MB RAM  80MB PAGEFILE.SYS
Novell Netware 4.11 Server
1.  Set /MAXMEM=12 in BOOT.INI so as to force swapping.
2.  Load NT; Authenticate to NT and Netware (I used the same ID and
Password for both systems.); Verify connection by mapping a drive.
3.  To ensure that sufficient swapping takes place, run a large program
(this forces the user-id and password information stored in RAM to be
placed into PAGEFILE.SYS.)
4.  Exit NT; Boot to DOS; diskedit PAGEFILE.SYS
5.  Search for one of the following strings (do NOT include the ""
 IntraNetware Client:        NWUserName="user-id"
     WlMprNotifyPassword="password"
     "UserName"    (if the username is alone, the password will follow
very closely)
 Client Services for Netware
     nwcs"password"    (the password is all CAPS and will immediately
follow nwcs)
In a "real-life" environment, most likely there will be enough swapping
on the system that setting the /MAXMEM switch will be unnecessary.  The
switch is only to help confirm that this hole exits.
If anyone has any knowledge of this, please post it to the list.

@_subject: Encrypting same data with many keys... 
What are the dangers of taking a small block of data - say upto 1K in
size, then producing many files, each being the same data encrypted by
other keys? A known plaintext attack won't help you to break the keys unless you have
one of the eight keys, but will having many keys that encrypt the same
data significanltly weaken the security of that tiny chunk of data?
And no, I don't mean, there's N keys so the odds of brute forcing the data
is now N times easier.  Assume we're using 128 bit Blowfish/Idea or
better, and discarding weak keys.  Are there any differential or other
cryptanalysis methods to use the eight resulting cyphertexts to get at the
data other than brute forcing it if you don't know any of the keys?
What if instead of using a private key cypher, we used a public key
cypher?  Would that make any difference in attack methods?
The data won't contain any text, or identifiers (i.e "GIF89" in GIF files,
"MZ" in wintel executables, etc...)  known or guessable to the attacker...

So if I wanted to do this and use RSA, how could it be shielded from
attack?  I take it switching to DH or MH won't help.   Would Eliptic

Maybe a random session key in the middle would help?

@_subject: Encrypting same data with many keys... 
In terms of padding does it matter WHERE I put the padding info?  Is it
better to put random stuff in the front or at the end?  The reason I ask,
say that you're going to encrypt an N byte block where N is bigger than
your block cypher's key size?
If my intution is correct, and you have the same data encrypted with many
keys (even RSA) but have the padding at the end, the 1st block would still
be breakable.  I suppose putting the data at the end would also result in
the same kind of problem, though it might be a bit harder to attack than
putting the data 1st...
Would it not make sense to scatter the random padding throughout the
block?   How is this normally done?  Front?  Back?  Middle?  Scattered?
These are some of the same thought threads that I went through when I
designed WhiteNoiseStorm - (Do a net search for WNS210.ZIP for more info
on it.)  Basically, this cypher uses random block sizes called windows-
(it's more of a stream cypher at the input, but a block cypher at the
output) and mixes random noise with the data.  The bits it hides in the
ramdom noise source are scattered throughout the window AND encrypted.  It
turns out this is useful for stego use and that's what it turned into.
But this may be another use for it...
Since an attacker doesn't know the window size and since the window size
varries randomly from window to window, it's very hard for the attacker to
use known or chosen plaintext attacks.  If you encrypt the same data N
times, you get N different cyphertexts.
It's never been cryptanalized (far as I know - could be the spooks have
done so already) so its strength is unknown...  But I suppose using
something like WNS would be ideal for encrypting the same data with
different keys...
The big disadvantages though: you need a really good source for random
numbers and the size of the cyphertext is much much bigger than the
plaintext... anywhere between 1.5 to 10X depending on the security level
you chose. :)  (And it's a symmetric key cypher, CBC only...  If I can
figure out a way to turn it into a PK system, it would really be
usefull...) .+.^.+.|  Ray Arachelian    |Prying open my 3rd eye.  So good to see |./|\.

@_subject: Memme: Crypto=Bullet Proof Vests 
I came up with this while on a bio break....
ITAR classifies crypto as munitions, but this is the same thing as telling
someone who wishes to travel to a warring country that they may not buy a
bullet proof vest, but they may buy an vest that will stop pebbles being
thrown at them.  This is equivalently reasoned that such vests could be
used to rob banks and the theives could get away from the police - but how
many bank theives have you known that were shot by the cops and not caught
by other means?
It believes that only the USA has bullet proof vests and it is a matter of
national security that no one else have bullet proof vests.  These aren't
tactical weapons equivalent to 20MegaTon nukes, these are devices that
help save lives.  Meanwhile other countries have also created bullet proof
vests, some that protect against high velocity bullets.
We can understand that vest piercing bullets kill policemen and that they
are reasonably outlawed, but if someone built a vest that would stop those
we wouldn't be able to mail them to those fighting for democracy outside
of the USA.
In the case of crypto, crypto is a tool that saves your privacy.  Why are
we not allowed to have the ability to ship the tools needed to help
protect privacy of say the students in China (for example) where any
suspicion of disidence would be instantly punishable by death.
For a country that is intent on making the world safe for democracy,
we are sure doing a very bad job.
Sure, a bullet proof vest can be used to protect a pornographer or a
terrorist, but it will also save the lives of citizens, freedom fighters
and children.  How many parents who live in bad neighborhoods would object
to their kids being able to wear bullet proof vests, could they afford
them, while going to school?
The recent bills thrown around in congress are attempting to do the
equivalent of outlawing bullet proof vests, and only allowing pebble proof
vests to be sold, or bullet proof vests that can be pierced by police.
Would you want your kid to wear a vest that can be pierced by police fire?
Maybe a stray bullet aimed at a drug dealer hitting your kid?   Or maybe a
criminal getting their hands on the same type of ammo and shooting your
kid?  We need our kids to wear Strong Bullet Proof vests!
Next time they yell "But if it saves the life of one child" give them
this.  "But if strong crypto can save the life of one child
freedomfighter, who are we to limit its use?  Support strong crypto and
protect the kids of the world!"
(Preaching to the choire of course, but who knows maybe the crypto=bullet
proof vest arguement will be useful to someone who can talk sense into the
crypto clueless cognresscritters.)

Okay, so let's modify it to be domestic then and say "only cops can buy
body armor" etc... instead.
Welp, using such arguements whenever possible, whenver the media and the
kongress will list will help monkeywrench domestic anti-crypto
legislation, or GAK only legislation.  This is still a valuable tool to
use in addition to making it ubuquitous. :)
Here's another project: if we can get enough $$$ to burn thousands of CD's
burned with Crypto on them and then get Software ETC and Egghead, and Rat
Shack and others to give them away as freebies the way that they give away
Netcomm and Prodigy and AOL CD's, we could reach quite a few folks.
I've done some of this a few years back at various PC and other Expos on
floppies, but getting Win95 and Mac versions of PGP wrappers and stuff to
fit on a floppy isn't feasable. :)
What would be cool is if we could ship an EudoraLite with a freeeware PGP
built (or some such), a crypto IRC client, an anonymous remailer client
(like the mixmaster java applet) and other such "internet access tools" on
this CD and tout it as Secure Internet access tools or some such. :) And if we can get a bunch of ISP's to allow us to use their client
software, say Netcom and such (not that I want to give them money) it
could be pretty useful for Joe Sixpack "I wanna get on the 'net thing" True, but when they scream "save the children" we can use the above and
show that our own government forbids us to "save the kids" from bullets by
making wearing of body armor forbidden.   We can then say crypto=body
armor and take it from there possibly getting both released.  (That and
three quarters will buy you a cup of coffe, but we have to try.)
The arguement can be raised, why can't normal citizen units purchase
bullet proof vests?  If this isn't a clear cut hint that we've been living
in a police state, what is?  Cops sodomizing black men on the street with
toilet plungers and beating the shit out of them?  Gun laws? :)

This is really Guiliani's fault for hiring so many damn cops.  NYC now has
so many cops that if you walk down the street in most neighborhoods for
more than 5 minutes you'll see at least one cop car.  In their rush to
hire cops, they also hired scum as cops.  Who knows how many such
incidents go unreported or are covered up. :(  Damned police state if I
ever saw one.
As for stopping crime, they ain't doing shit.  They're picking on small
things like parking tix and such, but as for going after mobsters and drug
dealers, the piggies are snarfing donuts.  All I've ever see them do is
ticket cars and tow them away.

Sure I can blame them.  If they're unwilling to support the constitution
and do what's right and proper by it, they don't belong in the police
force, they belong in the congress with all the other political scum
sucking bastards.
Probably for the same reason you didn't chose to remain in Russia and came
here. :)  Whatever crimes he might have been arrested for and allegedly
commited don't mask or negate that the police raped him.  Pure and simple.
Did you mean "white" instead of "while"?  I believe the pig^H^H^cop
involved was hispanic not white, so your racist comment is out of place,
but whatever... IMHO, Dinkins was a weak mayor, probably a puppet to
someone else.  Just dig up some old news bulletins and speeches of his and
you'll see he's very meek and afraid.  I doubt he had any control over
this city. While under his regime, city hall was constantly surrounded by cops almost
daily.  I used to work near there and saw it durring lunch.  Bomb scares
and all that I think...  Gee I wonder what he was afraid of?
I wasn't around there that much when Guiliani came so I don't know if the
blockades remained or not.  Perhaps some other knowledgeable punk can
answer that.... Still, all he did was battle with the UN and inflict a police state on us
which does nothing but put tickets on windshields and steals cars parked
on the public streets to sell them for profit, or holds them hostage for
you.  Obviously the laws of diminish returns apply to hiring cops as
well..  at a certain point all the good cops are already hired and all
you're left to hire is pure scum.

if you care to be a part of the following.
The info that the PI will obtain will consist of (for Sanford W) DOB,
DMV, Car type, Tag Bank accounts, home number, cell number, phone
calls made in last 30 days, childrens name, home address, SSN, bank
cards held, credit report, etc.. I do not have $1,000 this year to throw at this but if you are
interested in helping out or have better ideas let me know. I will put
in $250. No checks will be sent to me, all to the PI if we come up with
the necessary $1,000. Also will need some good volunteers to put out
some web pages with the info I post. It is up to whomever to use the
info as they see fit. It is not my responsibility.

@_subject: Anonymous Remailers 
If I recall correctly, Eudora uses standard mailbox format just like Pine,
Elm and other unix like mailers, so it is possible to write a filter
program that would go through the mailbox file and do stuff for you, such
as stripping away headers.
Here's a question for those that use Eudora: is there a way to have Eudora
run stuff for you on incoming mail?  That is when it goes out and connects
to the POP3 server and downloads the mail, can it launch another
application to munge the new inbox?  If so, it should be easy enough to take the incoming mail and process it -
say using perl, VB or whatever, and you can probably just append stuff to
the outbox. (Other question, can Eudora be told to send outgoing mail at
certain hours?  If not, you'll have to have the program telnet out for you
to port 25 of the SMTP...)
I've done similar things in Perl (not using Eudora) for the bots that run
my filtered cypherpunks list.  One bot scrounges through my mailbox
looking for admin requests, another sends filtered mail out when enough
has queued up. Would be trivial enough to turn them into a remailer by glueing PGP to the
mix.  :) .+.^.+.|  Ray Arachelian    |Prying open my 3rd eye.  So good to see |./|\.

The elected scum are far from being human.  Apparently you haven't been
paying attention to lovely incidents involving plungers.  Is that
demonizing them?  Yes?  Good!
What compassion did they show?  Toilet plungers?  Bullets in the head,
flame throwers and tanks?
Unquestionable?  The very fact that I'm replying to you rather than
sending out the toilet plunger brigade should give you a hint.  What would
the LEA's do were you to present the same arguement to them and cause
enough noise that others took notice?
Right.  Same thing they must have been feeding the FBI the morning of the
Waco incident.  I believe the key phrases were "gun toting child
molesters."  Nevermind that they fried to a crisp those same kids they
supposedly were going to free from the clutches of the evil gun toting
child molesters, and the supposed molesters.
Incorrect: this process is objectively identical to the process
experienced by all HUMANS when faced with a horrid freedom destroying
government.  That it coincidentally is the same for the jackbooted thugs
before they are told to attack.
The difference is that no one is telling me to hate or feel rage.  The
actions of those who abuse freedom are my only inspiration.
Better that than standing in the auditorium and having Philip Zimmerman's
face displayed on the screen, interposed with a film of keys and cyphers
encrypting data and screaming wordlessly durring the Two Minutes of
Hate.  At least the former is based in honesty, not governmental orderes
under the threat of thoughtcrime.  It's not enough to fear Big Brother,
you must love him.
Still doesn't lessen the enemy's action, nor will it help the wrongs they
commited any.
Who said I'd be in the trenches or murder the enemy?  Who said I would
pick up a weapon and use it?  Hating them is not the same as taking
actions to quench that hate.  That should give your panic pause for
Do what you think is necessary within your ideals.
Erm?  What Jihad?  Since where are we so organized and sacred?  Hell, I
don't even own a gun, I don't know where you get your knee jerk reaction
from.  You certainly don't see me renting a Rider Truck and buying
fertilizer.  So where do you get "sacred" and "jihad" from?
Am I supposed to silence my hatred for the crimes against humanity that
the scum in power have commited, or for their incessant attempts at
destroying our freedoms because you can't deal with another's hatred?
Because you imagine and fear that hatred will lead to action?  Isn't that
what CENSORSHIP is about after all? I wouldn't think, nor hate, this way if it weren't for thinking about my
family and loved ones and their freedom.

They already make themselves less than human by their actions, not by

Untrue, the victim remained human, the cop was inhuman in his treatment.
It doesn't matter what his thoughts were, his actions made him inhuman.
An eye for an eye, a toilet plunger for another.  That's the only true
justice there can be. Distinction: cypherpunks don't want to control or take away your privacy.
Cypherpunks don't use toilet plungers.  Cypherpunks write code. :)
FBI should NOT exist.
Everyone.  Not in my world, but everyone's world.  The only law that
should exist is "do what you will as long as you harm none."  By harm I
only mean the following: physically (i.e. beat, kill, maim, etc.) and
property (i.e. theft, damage.)  Everything else is just excess bullshit.
There are a billion and one ways to harm a person physically.  You don't
need a billion and one laws to state that it is wrong.  One is sufficient.
Who does?  Who deserves less than basic human rights?  And yes, unlike the
scum that run the FBI, I include total privacy as a basic human right.
Just as important as the right to speak, think, or breathe air.
I understand your fears, but hating the enemy and knowing the enemy isn't
becoming it.  Revolutions aren't about taking over, they're about freedom
from the injustices done by the older regime.  Sure, in time the political
scum will rise to the top and another will be needed.  We've seen that
here already.

@_subject: passing on a chuckle (fwd) 
Noah's Ark... If it happened today
   And the Lord spoke to Noah and said,  "In six months I'm going
to make it rain until the whole earth is covered with water and all the
evil people are destroyed.  But I want to save a few good people, and two
of every kind of living thing on the planet.  I am commanding you to build
An Ark."
   And in a flash of lightning, He delivered the specifications for an
Ark. "Okay," said Noah, trembling with fear and fumbling with the
  "Six months, and it starts to rain," thundered the Lord. "You'd better
have the Ark completed, or learn to swim for a very long time."
  Six months passed, the skies clouded up and rain began to fall.
  The Lord saw that Noah was sitting in his front yard, weeping.
  And there was no Ark.
  "Noah," shouted the Lord, "Where is the Ark?"
  "Lord, please forgive me!" begged Noah. "I did my best.  But there were
big problems.  First, I had to get a building permit for the Ark
construction project, and your plans didn't meet code.  So I had to hire
an engineer to re-draw the plans.  Then I got into a big fight over
whether or not the Ark needed a fire sprinkler system.
   "Then my neighbor objected, claiming I was violating zoning by
building the Ark in my front yard, so I had to get a variance from the city
  "Then I had problems getting enough wood for the Ark, because there was
a ban on cutting trees to save the Spotted Owl.  I had to convince the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife that I need the wood to save the Owls.  But they
wouldn't let me catch any owls, So, no owls.
  "The carpenters formed a union and went out on strike.  I had to
negotiate a settlement with the National Labor Relations Board before
anyone would pick up a saw or hammer.  Now we have sixteen carpenters
going on the boat, and still no owls.
  "Then I started gathering up animals, and got sued by an animal
rights group.  They objected to me taking only two of each kind.
  "Just when I got the suit dismissed, EPA notified me that I
couldn't complete the Ark without filing and environmental impact
statement on your proposed flood.  They didn't take kindly to the idea
that they had no jurisdiction over the conduct of a Supreme Being.
  "Then the Army Corp of Engineers wanted a map of the proposed
new flood plain.  I sent them a globe.
  "Right now, I'm still trying to resolve a complaint from the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission over how may Croatians I'm supposed to
hire. The IRS has seized all my assets, claiming I'm trying to avoid
paying taxes by leaving the country.  And I just got a notice from the state
about owing them some kind of use tax.  I really don't think I can finish the
Ark for at least another five years," Noah wailed.
   The sky began to clear.  The sun began to shine.  A rainbow
arched across the sky. Noah looked up and smiled.
  "You mean you're not going to destroy the earth?" Noah asked
  "No," said the Lord sadly.  "The government already has."

@_subject: Welfare Solution #389 
Making things more expensive rarely works.  Infact, it has the opposite
effect.  Case in point: I recall many years ago back in high school one of
the first business simulations out there came out; the class was split up
into different teams, each a company selling competing products.
Our team won by raising the cost of the items to the highest price
possible.  We still had enough simulated suckers purchasing the product to
make more money than all the other corporations. Not that this is reflective of real life, but the point is that if you
make something very very expensive and hard to get, then you will still
have people buying it, not as many as if it were free, but if there is
enough demand, you'll make a lot more money than if you were selling
volumes of the stuff.  Hence the illegalization (is there such a word?) of
drugs serves only to make the drug dealers rich.  The mob got rich the
same way durring prohibition.
Want to end the drug problem?  Sell the drugs dirt cheap.  Treat driving
while high the same as driving while drunk.  Treat drugs the same as
alcohol.  Treat junkies the same as alcoholics.  The dealers will go out of business, or give them drug selling licenses -
same as liquor licenses, and yes, the junkies will get even more addicted,
but at least the ones that OD will be evolution in action and will be
removed from the gene pool.   Certainly, you'll no longer have drug
related murders, or dealers buying BMW's.
(On a side note: Though I still think selling alcohol on Sundays should be
legal, especially to non-xians.  This is one law that certainly crosses
the separation of church and state...  If one isn't Xian, non drinking on
Sunday mornings being enforced is discriminatory against non-Xians.)

Maybe I am too slow brained (ha!) Lemme get your model straight - and it
is your model:
Okay, so now everyone is down to 5 units.  Now say that Joe takes a
plunger to Bob as well and everyone is down yet another 5 points,
therefore all humans, including both Alice and Bob are down to zero points
making them all inhuman.
At this point the perpetrator, uninvolved and the victim are all
inhuman.  In the above case, Alice is uninvolved, yet in your model she is now
inhuman.  Further, poor Bob is left with two punctures to his butthole and
is deemed inhuman as well?  Well, that's certainly equal treatment for
victim, perpetrator and uninvolved.  Given X humanity points to all humans
and given over more than 4,000,000 years of existance, I'd say we'd all be
in the negative humanity points by now.
Solution to your model in trying to keep Humanity Points:
Now if Bob pulled out a gun and humanely put both Paul and Joe out of
Bob's misery, humanity's humanity points wouldn't be effected.  Thus in
your model, killing all the perpetrators (in a humane way of course,
without malice) would solve the problem.  Better yet, humanely nuke
everyone off the planet, that way nobody can possibly commit any crimes,
thus keeping humanity points constant.
Sorry, I don't accept your model as it is clearly invalid.  Are you
begining to see how silly this is, or do I need to send the toilet plunger
troops after you?  :)
So quit trying to push these silly assed morality models on us already.
You came up with this shit, I've twice more than clearly shown you how
silly it is.  Give up already and quit bothering us with illogical

Good question... I'd like to know where you got it so I can smoke some
too... must be some good mind altering shit....
How's that again?  Earlier you were saying that if any human considers
another human inhuman, all huamns lose humanity points, I showed an
example whereby all of humankind's inhumans action (by your model) would
calls all humanity - including the cop - to lose their humanity points to
the point of having negative humanity points therefore being human.  Why
are cops an exception to this?
OTOH: By your new example:
If you now take a blood sample from the plungee, is he human as well?  If
so, then both the cop and the plungee are human, therefore neither has
lost humanity points, and if someone else came with a chainsaw and cut the
cop's head off, and you now take all three persons' blood, they all are
human.  Whether or not the chainsaw dude did it with malice and thought the cop
inhuman, all three blood samples will still show human.
So what's your point now?

@_subject: Security of Encrypted Magic Folders 
If it is exportable, then it is weak encryption by definition.  The
question is how weak.  Reading their marketting crap provides more
insights in just how lame this is:
In other words: security through obscurity.  Smells like snake oil, looks
like snake oil, it even has bits of snake scales in it.  Heck, if they say
that the key size is not important, it's likely very tiny, or regardless
of what key size you'd use (if you had any choice), it's such a weak
cypher that it wouldn't get you anything.
Whoop.  so the key is the location of the data?  At most, this means a 32
bit key on most file systems, 64 bits on newer file systems.  This assumes
that your file is long enough for that.  But as a key, this is totally
useless as the key is the location which is visible to all.  Likely they
would be wise to "mix" this location key with the passphrase.
This offers little more than CBC would.  The only difference is that CBC
is based on the previous block, where this is based on the location of a
byte in the file (which is known) whereas a CBC depedns on knowledge of
the previous block.
If they did it the right way, they'd use the passphrase to build a lookup
table of large keys based on the byte location within a file, but because
this depends on your passphrase, your security is still that of the
passphrase at maximum.  There may be ways to weaken this.
This is total bullshit.  It's Grade A, government approved exportable
snake oil.  Just because they are small and obscure it doesn't guarantee
you any extra safety.  Just because nobody has bothered to write a brute forcer for their code
doens't mean nobody can do so.  And no, this would not violate any of
their copyright if the author of the brute forcer proggie wrote it without
copying their code.  It might violate intellectual property laws if they
had a patent on it, but they can't get one since they're going by
security through obscurity.  They claim to be applying for a patent, but
if they do, their code is published and their weaknesses will be
It might violate trade secret laws if someone who has the source or the
algorithm shares it, but not if someone reverse engineers it (depending on
reverse engineering laws of course.) Just because they could "rewrite" the code in the next update against
cracking or brute force attacks does not buy you security.  FYI: If you
use this crap and someone steals a copy of the encrypted files off your
hard drive, it doesn't matter what new updates this company produces.  The
fact is you used the older breakable version, the attacker has your
cyphertext and will decode it. Translation: We don't use CBC, because that would be more work and slow
down our crappy cypher.  Deeper translation: break any portion of any
encrypted file and you'll likely break the whole thing if not huge parts
of it.  "Established encryption methods (sic)" use CBC because it adds security. Their algorithms are well published and well known so people can find
their weaknesses and publicise them.  Whatever weaknesses there are in
this thing are hidden from those who can't or won't reverse engineer it. But there are plenty of those who can and will, and have no qualms about
releasing it anonymously, or worse: keeping the expolit to themselves so
as to exploit those stupid enough to use this lame shit.
It only takes one cracker with a good disassembler to reverse engineer
their code and find all the holes, and they'll be out of business.  If
what protects your data is the cypher, and not the key, then breaking the
cypher is all you need to do.
Heck, I'd bet they use something really shitty like this: (since "key size
is not important", and "depends on location".)
char code(char *passphrase, char data, long location);
  int i; char c;
  for (i=0; passphrase[i]>0; c^=passphrase[i++]);
  return (data ^ c ^ (char)(location & 0xff));
Gee, I probably violated their "intellectual" property by guessing their
code, heh.
Not if you use an encrypted disk driver.  then, all your data is encrypted
all the time.  (You get into other issues such as keeping the passphrase
or key from falling into the pagefiles, etc...)

Actually, a quick browse through several machines' registry revealed this
key as well in a list of cyphers. The bitch lives in:
Along with shit like the following under Ciphers.
RC2 128/128
RC2 128/40
RC4 128/128
RC4 40/128
RC4 64/128
Tripple DES 168/168
Interestingly all the DES and RC2/RC4's have the same value (0xffffffff)
for the enable key (including TrippleDES).  Skipjack, and RC4 64/128 have
different values (0x30, and 0x3f respectively).  Null has an enable value
of zero. Adjacent to the ciphers key, there is a key for hashes listing MD5 and
SHA, next to that is a KeyEXchangealgorithms key listing:
Diffie-Hellman, PKCS, and Fortezza.  All of these except Fortezza use
0xffffffff as the enable value.
The Fortezza and Skipjack keys have the same "Enabled" key values! Additionally there is a ServerHandshakeTimeout value on the Fortezza key
of 60000. Likely this "enabled" value is a link to some DLL that contains their
There is also a key called Protocols listing: "Multi-Protocol
Unified Hello", PCT 1.0, SSL 2.0, SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0.  All of these have
subkeys of "Client" and "Server" with no values set.
Adjacent to this key, is a key called Certification Authorities, showing
shit like AT&T, GTE, MCI, Keywitness Canada, Thwate, and of course
I've sniffed around schannel.dll and it is what builds or looks for these
registry entries.  It also looks for rsabase.dll and crypto32.dll and
cryptodlg.dll(?).  In schannel.dll there's a string that says: Fortezza
(DSS/SHA).  So SHA is there.
IMHO, From the looks of it, these are just stubbs without any code behind
them since the RSA code contains the RC2/RC4, RSA, etc. code.  (Though I
could be wrong.)
It's not SP3.  I've got two servers with SP3 and IIS3.0with ASP and no
Skipjack keys, so that leaves IE4 or IE3 as possible suspects (or some of
the hotfixes.)  The non-Skipjack entry machines do have all the other
cyphers, so something in ie4 and/or iis4 is what adds them in.
Interestingly enough this entire subkey isn't in Nt5Beta1. :)
Likely what it could be is a hook to a device driver that talks to a PC
Fortezza card or some such.

"The grapes are probably Sour" says Vileus.
Sorry Kook, your spam doesn't make it to the filtered list, though I'd hate to admit it, your sane posts, the ones that you write once every blue moon, do in fact make it on the filtered list.  You are only complaining because people chose to not hear your inane spam, lies, racism, and blatant homophobic banter.
And no, my complaints about you, which you claim are lies, do not get sent to the filtered list, they get sent to your ISP for their racist slants.
Hey, if you want cypherpunks mail with spam, subscribe to cypherpunks at toad.com, want it without spam, subscribe to one of the filtered lists.  Since filtering will soon be done at toad.com, you will have the choice there.
Oh, of course, since you spammed the list with so much vitriol and flames,
you can't subscribe, so you'll just have to get your cypherpunks mail
under a pseudonym, or from usenet or the web archives or whatever.  Also, since you do not consider yourself a cypherpunk, nor are on the list (except to flame it), your oppinions are as useful as a steering wheel on a fish's tail.
As for being a Jew or a homophobe, you are welcome to be whatever it is
you like to be, even an Armenian hating racist, and you are free to
discuss your religion, ethnicity, racism, and sexual prefrences with
whomever you want in the appropriate forums - if they happen to have cyrpo
relavance, feel free to post them here, otherwise find another place to
vent your angst.  Hell, you are free to create al.fan.vulis and discuss yourself there! Cypherpunks is for crypto-anarchy oriented posts ONLY regardless of what you claim, believe or bitch.

Filters aren't intelligent enough.  How do you propose to filter out the anonymous dialy warnings about Tim May?
while they originally came with a fixed subject which one could filter, they are now popping up anonymously with random crypto related subjects.  If you filter all anonymous mail, you lose the good anon mail you might want to read.  Yeah, you can look for "Timmy, Mayo, Maya" and other clues, but these will prevent you from reading other posts which contain those words.  Least you expect us to use A.I. filtering which require trainng and don't really exist.  Feel free to write one if you are so Even our friend Vulis has sane posts when he takes his medication (though I suspect he does so rarely.)  Filtering out everything he posts doesn't make sense, as reading the sane stuff will have some value.  I don't want to miss what he says when it is worth my time to read it.
For the same reason that you don't watch all 150+ cable channels on your TV (assuming you have a TV and cable) at the same time.  It is a waste of your time to attempt it, you have no interest in 99% of it.  You want to read what is relevant to your interests, if you have subscribed to cypherpunks, it is because some of the material posted here is of interest to you.  This material has to do with crypto, crypto-anarchy, some politics as it relates to crypto, and crypto related news.  IF you want to find out about the mating calls of seaguls, you subscribe to whatever mailing lists share that interest; not everyone who subscribes to cypherpunks wants to read about seaguls.  Or mad rants about the sexual prefs of folks on this list, especially when posted with malice.
Or for that matter tons of posts advertising various crap sent to "Fuck_You_Punks" and other such users.  These were clearly requested to us by folks who claim their names to be "Fuck_You_Punks"; advertising doesn't belong here either.  If you want to advertise on the list, fine, pay the list owner for air time.
As for me, I do not read newspapers or watch the news on TV since to me they are depressing, boring and useless.
The proposed scheme should not affect anyone in any way.  Those who want the filtered list will get it, those who want the spams and flames and ads and turds will get them, those who want it all will also get them.
Why are you so opposed to giving people a choice to pick between the moderated and unmoderated lists personally?  Just as there is freedom of speech, there is the freedom to ignore, to chose to filter or tune out flames and turds.  The proposed scheme of having three mailing lists empowers the readers of this list to chose for themselves.
Are you so afraid that no one cares about what you have to say, that they won't have to listen to you?  Or are you just paranoid and see flashes of censorship before your eyes?
Think about it this way: if a device existed that allowed TV viewers to not see commercials, would they purchase it?  Why shouldn't you allow them to chose to ignore commercials?  Maybe because you're an advertiser and are paying for the commercials?  Maybe, but I think most TV watchers would love to have such a device; some won't want it, or would want to watch the commercials.  But they would have a choice.
How is this any different?

Sandfort isn't the only one who will do this, there will be a pool of moderators. Regardless of your personality conflict, I am sure that Sandy will remain fair and allow appropriate posts from you through. i.e. anything to do with crypto. :)
What makes you say that there is only one scheme that can succeed?  Why is
having a moderated list and an unmoderated list bound to fail?  The plan
actually (unless it changed without my knowlege) is to have 3 lists.  1
moderated, 1 rejects, 1 unmoderated.  This can be optimized as 1 moderated
and 1 rejects as you propose, since asking for all is the same as asking
for moderated+rejects. What difference does it make if a message is delayed for 10-30 minutes?  Why is it a bad idea or suspicious?  If you post something and it doesn't make it at all, you can complain about it.  Is that what you fear?
The point was to optimize the sendmail to send moderated messages first.
Bad faith comes from the thousands of unsubscrive and such messages posted here.  People have no clue as how to do things.
In the interest of cutting the crap off this list which has virtually brought the list down to its knees because of our friendly KOTM dude, it is best to bring a bit of civility here.  If people want to see crap, let them subscribe to it.
It's bad enough to have spammers and advertisers on a list, but if we have
the majority of the subscribers immune to their spams, the spam will die. If everyone had the ability to filter out commercials, especially the
annoying ones, advertisers would go away.  The difference here is that the
ads don't support the station with $, they flood it with crap which
alienates discussions. You have a personal problem with Sandford, it doesn't mean that Sandy will be unable to be a perfectly able moderator.  I'm sure Sandy will do a fine job, but that is my oppinion and it doesn't match yours.  From the looks of it, it's more the case that this is a clash of egoes rather than a complaint about the moderation.

What kind of concealed human involvement?  Running a raw list + a moderated list doubles the traffic.  Running a moderated + flames list keeps the traffic the same.  What's there to conceal when a flames list If your threat model is that paranoid, what's to stop someone now from intercepting traffic from toad.com from the sendmail queues?

Internet censors blocking Jersey's 'sexy' counties By Jeff May
Newark Star-Ledger
July 1, 1997 With its tractor pulls, pig and poultry exhibitions, and demolition
derbies, the Sussex County Fair is almost a parody of wholesome fun. But to some programs that parents use to block pornographic material
on the Internet, the Web site for "New Jersey's Best Fair" might as well
be a pit of sin. The problem: Sussex contains the word "sex." To a computer
searching for smut, that's all that's needed to raise a red flag. Most filtering programs rely on key words, and sex is at the top of the
forbidden list. Children who try to log on to the Sussex fair site might
as well be trying to dial up Playboy online. Essex and Middlesex counties have the same problem. The free
program that America Online provides for its subscribers, for example,
blocks online access to both Essex County College and the Essex
County Clerk's Office. "We're as G-rated as a Disney movie," protested Patrick McNally, the
county clerk. Passport information and property tax tips hardly make for racy
subject matter, and McNally said he was "somewhat amused" that it
would be considered as such. Web surfers apparently agree: Since the
site was created earlier this year, only 2,958 people have visited it. "Probably 2,900 are me," McNally said. But McNally said he understood the impulse to use parental control
programs, which are expected to become more popular in the wake of
the Supreme Court's decision to strike down government control of
indecent material on the Internet. "As a father, I certainly don't want my children to stumble across
something they shouldn't on the Net," he said. "I could see where it
would be a problem." Most problems with the screening devices occur when parents rely on
the broadest keywords possible, said Gordon Ross, president and
CEO of Net Nanny, one of several programs on the market to screen
out objectionable content. They usually disappear as users become
more knowledgeable about the system. "Unfortunately, some people don't read the manuals," he said. Parents may not need to by 2000. Advances in artificial intelligence are
expected to make the cybercensors a lot more discriminating, Ross said.
"A lot of the decisions will be made by the computer itself," he said. Some companies say they've already reached that point. A spokesman
for Surfwatch, Jay Friedland, says the popular program uses "pattern
matching" to weed out references to sex but not acceptable ones such
as the poet Anne Sexton. "The key focus for us is real simplicity," Friedland said. "Even if we
were overblocking accidentally, it is very easy to turn off." But most e-mail requests to the company ask for advice about blocking
sites, not unblocking them, he said. "It's about 100 to one," he said. For now, sponsors of the Sussex County Fair aren't overly concerned
about children being unable to scroll through the festival's web site. The
site is a little more than a year old, but the fair doesn't rely on it for
promotions, said spokeswoman Kathleen Cafasso. Dropping the web site address's reference to Sussex which, like the
similar county names, is derived from the Saxons of old England isn't
an option, Cafasso said. "We wouldn't even consider it," she said. "It's not worth the lack of
identification."

** INNOVATIONS: SPYING SAUCER **
Sikorsky Aircraft in Stratford, Conn., has designed and built a small,
round rotary-wing pilotless aircraft that can locate and follow objects,
flying down urban streets or peeping into windows.  The Cypher is
propelled by two rigid motors, one above the other, that revolve in
opposite directions.  The outside shell of the aircraft is rounded, like
a donut, giving the machine some protection when it bumps into tree
branches, or the sides of buildings. It can stay aloft for about two and
a half hours, using advanced software made by Lockheed Martin and
Northrup Grumman to find and trail enemy soldiers, or scout out an urban
setting for potential sharpshooters.  A video camera mounted on the
aircraft can peer through windows when engineers on the ground signal the
Cypher to land on a nearby rooftop.  "The beauty of Cypher," says the
aircraft's project leader, "is that it can fly low and slow."

Yep - and it takes the blame (or so historians believe) of the witch
hunts.  Idea was you'd go to someone's house, they'd cook food made with
the grains that were contaminated, you'd have an acid trip and claim them
to be in league with the devil and get them killed. :)
While we're on the topic, let's not forget that we'll need some sort of
crypto as well -- we should have the little buggers only produce the drug
on demand when given a signed PGP message. :)  That way if the feds knock
down your door, they'll find no evidence.  Whenver you need your hit, you
ask the buggers to make you some, and you use it immediatly.
OTOH, there's something to be said about having fast acting yeast that
feeds on grass and other foliage (real grass, not canabis) and produces
tons of illegal substance. You could then simply fling this into the back
yards of LEA's everywhere, then call the cops on them.
Anyone know enough about DNA machine code to port PGP to yeast? .+.^.+.|  Ray Arachelian    | "If you wanna touch the sky, you must  |./|\.

Also Sprach Ray Arachelian:
Actually - and you can forward this to relevant parties - woad, the
infamous herb used by the Celtic warrior in the form of blue body paint, when mixed with urine (which is how they applied it to their
bodies) causes a reaction very similar to cocaine and most amphetamines.
The reduction in pain that is felt from wounds and the ecstacy brought
on can easily be confused with a typical beserker reaction. The term
beserk originates from "bare sark" - the beserkers wore little if no
armor and the Celts are particularily famous for going into battle
"in the altogether" except for the blue war-paint. The feeling of
invulnerability that comes from the woad "high" led to this custom.
Other semi-legal although dangerous "highs" can result from the ingestion of too much nutmeg or jasmine, both hallucenogens.

@_subject: If You Build It, They Will Con (fwd) 
July 15, 1997
 If You Build It, They Will Con   by Declan McCullagh  �����  ���� Perhaps the thinking behind DefCon went something like this: Lure
hundreds of hackers to Las Vegas in the middle of the summer, ply them with
cheap beer, talk about packet sniffing, and observe. Last year the result
was self-organizing chaos, capped by an event where the hired strippers
were upstaged by a band of exhibitionist conferencegoers. "The pimp was
like, 'Oh my God,'" says Dark Tangent, DefCon's organizer. ���� Last weekend's fifth annual DefCon may have been a little less
raucous, but it was no less important as a place where hackers from around
the world gather to socialize, gamble -- and glance around furtively trying
to spot the government agents who infiltrate the convention. (Bonus: If you
guess correctly, you can take a prized "I Spotted the Fed" T-shirt home
with you.) ���� Naturally, DefCon has always been populated with a slew of specialized
talks on "Hacking Novell Netware" and uses of "embedded microcontroller
applications." But this year, speakers such as Richard Thieme spoke of
finer points: For instance, how hackers should avoid merely imitating their
predecessors' exploits. Instead, they should learn the intricacies of
computer systems themselves. "This is really functioning as a call to
excellence," Thieme says. Then there was Carolyn Meinel, who maintains the
"Happy Hacker" mailing list. "You don't need to break the law to be a
hacker," she told me. ���� Maybe not, but the DefCon crowd -- mostly teenagers and
twentysomethings -- wasn't listening. Some tried to pass counterfeit $20
bills when registering. ("We'll beat your ass," Dark Tangent warned
afterward.) Others tried to snatch the DefCon banner from the convention
hall. By the time the conference began, the hotel's antiquated phone system
had been penetrated and instructions distributed on how to call long
distance for free. The hotel's radio frequencies quickly appeared on the
DefCon mailing list. On Friday evening, security guards booted two revelers
after a hallway skirmish led to blows. And someone was carrying around a
door to a GTE truck -- I never found out why. ���� All of which might explain Las Vegas's growing reluctance to host the
event. Dark Tangent says the convention has become virtually blackballed.
"You're dicked. There's no place to go," he says. This year, Dark Tangent
had to rename the convention "DC Communications" and take out $1 million in
liability insurance. He also moved the conference to the Aladdin, a
ramshackle hotel -- complete with faded purple carpets and cheesy lounge
singers -- that seems the only venue now willing to risk hosting DefCon. ���� Still, the Aladdin seemed a choice venue for Winn Schwartau, the
"InfoWar" crooner whom many hackers love to hate. He showed up to host two
rounds of Hacker Jeopardy. Teams of digerati took turns heckling Schwartau
and competing in categories such as National Security for $300: "A: The two
possible meanings of DOS. Q: What are Denial of Service or Disk Operating
System?" Or, "A: The assistant director of the FBI who handled the TWA
investigation and was behind the Clipper Chip. Q: Who is James Kallstrom?" ���� Bruce Schneier, author of "Applied Cryptography" (and the star of his
Hacker Jeopardy team), spoke on Saturday about "Why Cryptography Is Harder
Than It Looks." He warned of overconfidence when designing a cryptosystem:
"The math is perfect. The computers are bad. The networks hideous. The
people worse." Says Schneier, "We need to recognize the limits of the
possible." ����Sameer Parekh, president of C2Net, spoke the next day about offshore
crypto-development: "We export jobs, not crypto." Jobs seemed to be what
many in the crowd were looking for. As one generation of hackers gives way
to another, a new batch of self-anointed "security consultants" appears on
the scene. Of course, there are never enough scouts in attendance to hire
them all. ���� Dejected, and unable to hack more than the hotel PBX, some found
solace in the seamier side of Las Vegas. I saw a note inviting everyone to
a "StripperCon" that was being held down the street at the Tropicana Hotel
on Saturday night. I went gambling instead. ���� Short $75, I wondered whether next year's DefCon would be worth
attending -- that is, if it happens at all. But surely there will be a
DefCon 6, and since Internet Underground has gone to pasture, who else will
there be to cover it? So I poured another shot, dialed 9# on the wall phone
and placed a long distance call to the editor. On the house. �

I'm probably wrong on this, but the "pr" at the end stands for public
relations, "nw" could be "news wire" or some such.  (And for the clueless,
IRS stands of course for evil jackbooted thugs that eat most of our
paychecks for breakfast...)  :)
For one thing, I suggest we setup a nice big form letter and spam them
back with it stating that we do not condone spamming and that we intend to
sue their asses for using our private emails to distribute government
propaganda.  (The quartering of soldiers and all that shit would be a nice
constituional point to include.)  Any lawyer like folk willing to write up
such a beast?  I'd gladly attach my email address to it as it's being
It could also be a mailing list, if it is, sending email to it will at
least confirm the theory...
It's interesting that I've tried two or three different networks and

Talk about giving them more credit than is due.  This is government you're
talking about.  Try 6 months to several years. :)  And don't forget about
the year 2038 problem (Unix rolls over dates on that date for 32 bit
systems...) Also, the year 2000 isn't a leap year, but most
PC's will think it is.
IMHO, come October 1999, take all your savings in the form of a cashier's
check and wait until Jan 2nd to redeposit it.  Good luck with credit
cards.  You might want to clear them off first..  And if you've got
mortgages, good luck if you don't wipe them off by then!
One easy fix to the problem (if the software supports it) is to convert
the two digit years (if they're stored as characters) into a 16 bit
unsigned integer.  That would be good until the year 65535, and still let
you use 1802 as a year.  But some warez use a single byte - which isn't
easy to extend...  Some RDBMS and DB's won't let you do this easily.  Life
sucks when corporations use code over the time it was meant for (like DES for instance) what can we say. :)

I offer the above as points because of all the recent exports of 128 bit
cyphers being allowed.  (It is possible they've other limitations they're
not allowed to tell us about such as the same string being encrypted in
all communications, or limits on PRNG's, but we don't know yet.)
The side note that Freeh supports GAK, but she doesn't only shows that
they speak for different agencies.  We know which one Freeh speaks for, we
believe we know who she speaks for.
If the whole point of GAK is to catch stupid criminals anyway, it will
lose.  The only criminals that aren't going to be caught are the smart
ones.   We've argued this with her for years, but she's stuck to her party
line, and all of a sudden she changes the party line.  People don't change
their minds without reason, and an NSA mouth piece isn't likely to defect
and live to talk about it or reverse their position publically.
This might add some weight to the recent "leak" about the NSA being able
to break 128 bit cyphers in 30 minutes, then again who really knows? Could
be conspiracy theories, or FUD.  IMHO this is bullshit unless they've a

Bullshit.  I've had accounts on escape, dorsai, and now brainlink. Neither forced me to prepay or sign any contract. I've seen plenty of
offers from NetCom and other providers for a free month of access.  Even
AOL gives free demo hours.  Any ISP that forces you to pre-pay for access or sign a contract isn't a
decent ISP by definition, and therefore any censoring they do is also
unimportant since they already by definition suck. There's enough competition between mom & pop ISP's out there that it
doesn't pay for them to censor or piss off their users.  The users can
simply tar their files and leave.  i.e.  Escape.com - when I was
subscribed to it had a broken trn, and after two-three months of asking
them to recompile it, I canceled my account and went elsewhere. (They had
tin, but I prefer trn.) There are also free and not so free news servers that one can point to,
DejaNews and other archive sources.  If your ISP precensors your feed, you
can get other feeds.
This is a silly arguement when the clients themselves can simply say no to
sucky censoring ISP's.
For example with my own accounts I refuse to subscribe to any ISP that
won't let me have a shell account.  PPP is nice and fine, but I want to be
able to run stuff from a shell. :)  (I wonder if the next volley of
censorship messages will say "Oh, that must mean you censor the ISP's
because you won't subscribe to ones that don't offer shell - to which I'll
answer fuck yes!)

@_subject: McVeigh 
There are those who would say that since the day care center catered to
employees of the building, etc. McVeigh didn't make a mistake there, as
reprehensible as that part of it was.
A better question, and a bigger issue is this: what plausible explanation
was given for the lack of BATF agents in the building on that day?  Could
it be that they knew about the attack?  If they did, why did they allow it
to happen, thus killing those kids in the day care center.  If they did,
we know who the true criminals are.  But this is a good question.  Will we
ever know the truth?
IMHO, If McVeigh did what he did, frying or lethal injection is
acceptable, he decided to take an action that would potentially cost him
his life, gambled and lost.  Like all terrorists, the price of killing
many is the price of being killed.  Etc.  It's a fair trade from one point
of view (though my money says he's shitting bricks right now), unfair from
the victim's point of view.
On one had we have the "faceless" evil governmet that McVeigh and Co. are
against.  On the other we have the day care center and media fodder, etc.
Somewhere in between lies reality.
What happens in the future and what results come out of this are yet
unknown.  Many threads of action by Uncle Sam are possible, unfortunaly,
he's likely to have forced the "faceless" evil ones to be yet even more
fascist and restrictive, which in turn would fuel the next set of
terrorist activities, and the impending revolution the militia is seeking.
Let's see what happens.
The unfortunate truth is that people will not put up with fascist behavior
for very long.  They may call for it to the point of a military state
citing crime statistics, unsafety and such...  But at one point you'll see
them scream "freedom" and grab the nearest weapon - be it a tree branch or
an A1 Abrams tank. :)  And that is something America once knew - now, it
knows "let's legislate the fuck out of the sheeple.  More laws.  This
should be illegal"  Or advertisements for things like circuses that say
"This much fun should be illegal" illustrate the point.
Life sucks.  Death sucks even more.

You do not know for a fact if he is guilty of murder.  You only know that
he was judged guilty.  Whatever the truth is, you and I, and everyone else
discussing this, cannot know.  McVeigh himself knows if he did it.
Witnesses (if any) would also know.  This is all speculation.
If indeed he is guilty, it's a fair trade.  X number of lives for his own,
for his cause, etc.  IMHO justice is what you make of it.  Were you in any
way affected by his actions?  Did you lose relatives in that bombing?
Personally, I didn't.  I don't call for slow torture because to me, it
isn't justice or injustice.  I was not affected by his actions.  If he did
set off the bomb, life in death, or execution is a valid punishment.  I do
question your reasoning for calling for torture though.  How is that fair
punishment and justice?

@_subject: BAD ADVICE WARNING from Kent: Access to Storage and Communication Keys 
write the following bad advice:
BBBBZZZZZZZZZT!  Wrong!
Passphrases can be memorized.  4mm DAT tapes hold several gigs and are
tiny.  Ever see one?  Fits in your pocket.  It's smaller that an audio
cassette. Fairly easy to guard, but, if your data is backed up in
encrypted form (cyphertext), and not clear text, you don't even need to
bother protecting the tape. (That is unless your backup software uses a
weak cypher as most tend to do.)  [FYI: Your knowledge of tape
technologies is severly lacking. 4mm tapes hold 2-4Gb.  Exabytes 5Gb-10Gb. Mamouth Exabytes (same size as 8mm camcorder video tapes, smaller than
audio cassettes) hold as much as 40Gb in a very small form factor.]
Or if you are afraid of loss to EMI and such, backup to MO media, or to
CDR media.  You can get 4Gb MO's these days fairly cheap, and since
they're just like hard drives you don't need to use backup software.
They're impervious to accidental wiping by magnetic waves, and they're
rewriteable, which means you don't have to pay much money to do new
backups.  OTOH, they are rewriteable, you might want to burn CD's, which
only store 650M, but two of them will easily store 1.2Gb, and prevent
loss by erasure.  At less than $6 in bulk this is very cheap.  You sti.l
have to protect the media from heat, direct sunlight, dust, scratches,
liquids, etc...
The best way to go is to have an encrypted volume, unmount the volume
before backing it up, and backup the sectors on the volume instead of
individual files.  To be safe, I'd run several backups since if the tape
goes bad on a spot that holds inodes, you've lost several directories...
But you can leave the tapes unprotected in clear view of the world. They're useless to those that don't have the passphrase.  Hence it costs
you $0.0 to secure tapes that hold strongly encrypted information.  It
costs a lot more to protect that said piece of paper.  (I would still
advocate keeping a set of tapes offsite in case of fire or other local
physical disaster - but the security risk of keeping them unsecured is
still zero if you are using a good hard drive encryptor that uses strong
crypto.)  If you are paranoid, you could encrypt your backup with a
different cypher.  (i.e. use IDEA on the hard drive, then backup and
encrypt the encrypted drive with 3DES and Blowfish, all using different
Yes, you can write your passphrase on paper, but if someone finds it you
are screwed.  Giving such advice is dangerous.  It is as if you told
someone to put a PostIt(tm) note with their account and password on their
monitor, or to use their birthday as their password, or their dog's name.
Paper is very easily compromised.  Weak passwords and passphrases are also
easily compromised.
If you want to protect your passphrase agaist memory failures (human
memory that is), break it up with a secure split function, and save it to
disk (or print it out in hex), then give a piece to each of several
trusted parties - who do not know each other. Something along the lines of
a K of N system where you'd need 5 pieces out of 8 to restore the
passphrase.  Oh, and those trusted parties should not be government agencies for the
simple reason of how beurocracies work. One could be a safety deposit box,
another could be a family lawyer (but make sure it's not a big agency),
another a cousin in a differnet city, another a neighbor, etc...  (I.E. I wouldn't leave anything with the CIA - see the news headlines for
all the reports of double agents bought off by the Russians, etc... though
it is more likely that the NSA would be safer place to store, either
because it has better controls on the data, or more likely because reports
of double agents there never reached the media...)  Still I wouldn't go
that route, though you personally might.  In general, you don't want to
leave them in the hands of corporations/agencies where folks getting paid
$5.50/hour can be easily bribed, or leaned on, or rubberhose persuaded, or
sold to the "If you knew what I knew" and "I'm from your government and
here to help you" lines.

MAJOR THREAT TO STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT CAPABILITIES
State and local law enforcement bodies have begun to find it difficult to procure the latest in Title III equipment, i.e. equipment "...primarily useful for the surreptitious interception of ... communication".  Unless action is taken at the highest levels of the federal government, there is no question that serious harm will be done to the abilities of state and local law enforcement to properly perform technical surveillance.
This is an extremely serious matter, and I urge you to take the time to
study this information.  Law enforcement's ability to properly perform its
duties faces a serious and a real threat, and correcting the situation will
not be easy, but it is something that MUST be done.
We're in this sorry state for two real reasons and one possible reason, viz:
Real Reason   The federal law that deals with monitoring that which has
been transmitted by radio is irrational, poorly written, unthinkably
stupid, incomplete, technically impossible to enforce, vague where it
should be specific, specific where it covers unenforceable prohibitions,
and primarily of value to vendors of cordless and cellular telephones
(because they can lie to their potential customers telling them: "nobody
can listen to you; it's against the law).
Real Reason   Some federal government entities have chosen to reinterpret elements of a law enacted almost thirty years ago (and amended many times since then).
Possible Reason.  There is great suspicion that some privileged companies
are steering some of the federal government's minions toward small
companies in order to remove possible competition from the marketplace --
in other words it is possible that the law is being selectively enforced
for the benefit of some firms.  Professionals who know their way around in
this arena are aware of some targeting that had been orchestrated by
entities that, although they deal in a big way with Title III equipment,
have remained unaffected by the federal government elements that have
suddenly developed real zeal to punish those who they say sell Title III
Background.  During the past TWENTY-NINE YEARS (since passage of Public Law
90-351, "The Safe Streets Act of 1968"), law enforcement at all levels in
this country has benefited because of a reasonable interpretation of the
elements of that law.  That has now all changed.  To allow you to
understand the situation we must first cover the specifics of the law, and
the way it has been interpreted over the years.
First, the prohibitions.  The law proscribes the use, possession and
even advertising of equipment "knowing or having reason to know that the
design of such device renders it primarily useful for the surreptitious
interception of ... communication".  Obviously there are categories of
people who are exempted from these prohibitions - such as the very law
enforcement people who would use it in investigations.  However, one of
those exemptions is now being reinterpreted.
I refer specifically to the interpretation of the exception relating to
"...an officer, agent, or employee of, or a person under contract with, the
United States, a State, or a political subdivision thereof..."  For almost
thirty years that phrase has been interpreted that honest businessmen
(manufacturers or dealers) who sold Title III equipment only to law
enforcement agencies were "agents under contract to...".  Small business
entrepreneurs and their dealers have, since passage of the PL 90-351,
operated under the belief that, if their customers were federal, state or
local law enforcement organizations, they were operating legally when they
designed, built and sold such equipment (or marketed it as agents of the
builder). Never having had any notice by any government body that a specific item
could be considered "Title III", sellers felt no compunction to refrain
from advertising and no concern about selling to non-law enforcement (except for obvious Title III items such as body wires).  This dogma has been reinforced and solidified by almost thirty years of practice.
Before covering the 1996/7 reinterpretation of this law, let's review
some recent events.
Enforcement History.  In 1991 or 1992 several businesses received a
certified letter from the FCC that began "It has come to our attention that
you are marketing..." and went on to accuse all of us of various felonies.
My written request to be told the specific product and the specific accuser
is to this day still unanswered.  However, one man, whose letter was
ignored and whose FOIA inquiry was ignored, finally inquired through his
congressman.  He was then informed that his FOIA action was sent to the
wrong address (!), and that the FCC accusations were based on "anonymous
telephone tips".  Yeah, Right.  (Those of us who are knowledgeable of the
players have a good idea of how those "anonymous" tips were received; we
remember seeing the guy who was siccing his FCC toady on various exhibitors
at more than one trade show.  Ah well.)
Then about two years ago a bunch of stores with "spy" in their names
were raided by the Customs Department for importing and selling forbidden
radio transmitting equipment.  (Personal comment: Good riddance; they were
mostly rip-off artists preying on people who wanted to spy on others.)
However, the serious reinterpretation that is tying up resources started
last year.  In 1996 and 1997 there has been a lot of activity based on 1)
lawyers pretending to be all-knowing technical experts and 2) a
reinterpretation of the exception clause quoted above. Current Status.  To the best of my knowledge, the first activity in this
"reinterpreting" arena was the indictment of Gilbert Walz and Jude Daggett
by US Attorney Michael J. Yamaguchi in the US District Court of Northern
California.  The indictment accuses them of selling devices "whose [sic]
design renders them primarily useful for the purpose of the surreptitious
interception of wire, oral and electronic communications".  (The paper I
have in front of me is called "SUPERSEDING INDICTMENT" and is dated May 2,
There is no reference in this indictment - or in any of the other
government papers I have - to the expert on whose opinion these indictments
are based.  Therefore, I have the terrible suspicion that Michael J.
Yamaguchi took it upon himself to make the kind of determination that can
only be made by a technical expert with education and experience in the field.
Both Walz and Daggett have been "out on bail" until the very recent
past.  Then, within the past few months,   it appears that various players
in this arena have been pressured to "set up" those gentlemen.
Walz took a telephone order for a piece of equipment, ordered it shipped
from Canada, and was arrested when it arrived in the hands of the man who
ordered it.  He never saw it, never touched it, never got paid one cent,
but was arrested and jailed for about one month before bail was set at one
hundred thousand dollars.  (By the way the man who ordered the equipment
and who received it, is still free as a bird.)  Daggett also was arrested (after also apparently being set up) and
jailed, but released after a week or two on personal recognizance.
I think it is important to note that these men have been selling these
items for years, and had asked one government official after another if
there was any question as to their legality.  The only answers they
received were non-committal.
Deleterious Results from These Actions.  These (and possibly other) actions
by various entities at the federal level have caused the "unarrested"
members of this community to pull in their horns.  They will no longer even
admit to possessing equipment that might be capriciously classified as
Title III.
The net result, unless some sensible order is created from this miasmic
mess, will be a set back for state and local LE bodies of five to ten years
in procurement of Title III equipment.  I say that because some of the
federal people involved have stated that "only people under contract to the
federal government" are covered by the exception noted above.  Even if that
is softened to the state and local governments as specified in the law, any
law enforcement agency that needs Title III equipment will  have to totally
technically specify its needs in a request for proposal, distribute the RFP
to a list (Where does it come from?) of competent firms, take proposals,
evaluate proposals, award contracts, evaluate products delivered; and
finally, years after the need was recognized, receive the product.
MY PERSONAL INVOLVEMENT
Last month, while Jude Daggett was locked up in jail, his partner
Gilbert Walz called and asked for my help in getting him out.  Jude called
also, and I agreed to do what I could.  The letter I sent to Jude's lawyer
follows.   Dear *******,
I am writing this on behalf of Jude Daggett, an honest man and a good
friend of more than ten years.  However, the opinions I express are not
generated by that friendship; they are based on my education and experience
and are totally consistent with my stated positions, writings and testimony
over the years.  Let me introduce myself and briefly list my qualifications
to comment on this case and the law under which it was brought.  I am an electrical engineer with almost fifty years of professional
experience in communications and electronics.  (A short resume follows.)  I
have been called as an expert witness in federal and state courts in civil
and criminal cases relating to electronic communication, eavesdropping,
etc.   The Office of Technology Assessment of the United States Congress
contracted with me to study and report on the vulnerability of our
telephone system to secret monitoring.  I believe I am the only engineer
ever to provide an expert opinion in federal court on the meaning of
"...knowing or having reason to know the design of which renders it
primarily useful for the surreptitious interception of ... communications"
as it relates to a specific item of electronic equipment. The law that applies originated as the Safe Streets Act of 1968, PL
90-351.  The specifics relating to "primarily useful for" were printed
under the heading "Title III" in that law, and that equipment has come to
be known as Title III equipment by those in this field.  90-351 and its
later versions were attempts to codify questions relating to monitoring the
communications of others, but all are flawed in many, many ways - primarily
due to the influence of lobbyists for the cellular telephone industry and
cordless telephone manufacturers.  They wanted to be able to tell their
customers "No one can listen; it's against the law."  In truth, despite any laws that can be written, that which has been
transmitted by radio, can and will, be listened to.  That is as immutable
as water running down hill.  Common, ordinary and essential electronic
parts and systems, useful for many other purposes, can be used to monitor
radio transmissions; and no series of laws or regulations can change that
verity.  There will always be people who will listen, regardless of any
laws on the books or lies told to potential customers.
People who choose to broadcast their thoughts by radio should not be lied
to; they should be cautioned that every word can be heard by others.  In
fact, the United States Supreme Court, in an eminently fair and reasonable
ruling, said that the man who had been imprisoned based on material his
neighbors heard him say over his cordless phone had "no reasonable
expectation of privacy".   The court ruled that no one invaded his privacy,
but, rather, that the signal received by his neighbors' cordless phone had
been transmitted by his deliberate act, and the content of his messages was
in no way privileged.
Radio transmissions are radio transmissions, and although cellular
transmissions are on different frequencies and handled differently than
cordless, they are still transmissions that can be received by anyone.
I'll opine that, when the law regarding cellular is tested at the supreme
court level, the ruling on the validity of the law will be the same as it
was in the cordless phone case.
So, I present the idea above as something that could be called a "global
defense" of Mr. Daggett and anyone else caught in the net that has recently
been cast.  However, let's consider the specifics of Mr. Daggett's case.
With regard to the specific case at hand I believe the most important
consideration is the legislative history of the federal law in question.
Although I do not have a copy in front of me as I write this, the essence
of the legislative history that applies is:  "...Because this is such a
specialized field, it's obvious that the services of an expert will be
required in considering whether the design of a device renders it primarily
useful for surreptitious interception of communication."  I have read the documentation on this case, and I am appalled at the fact
that technical laymen with no education or experience in this specialized
field have bluntly stated as a fact that the devices under consideration
are primarily useful for surreptitious interception of communication.  In
my opinion such statements are a travesty.  As a man with an education and
a lifetime of experience in the field, if I were asked that question, my
answer would be that I would have to:
have possession of each device for some time so I could operate it and compare it with other, technical equipment with similar capabilities, evaluate the cost vs. benefit of each possible equipment for the many
possible uses, (to explain, let's consider the monitoring equipment that
could be used on fax transmissions: There is a two-channel fax monitoring
system from Denmark that costs $60,000 and has the capability of
recognizing the formats used by all fax manufacturers.  Also, it is
possible to use a $30 tape recorder and $150 fax machine to reproduce faxes
transmitted by a machine of the same make.   With no other information to
influence my opinion, I would conclude that the person trying to collect
information illegally on someone else would opt for the inexpensive
approach; and that the company that needs to monitor communication between
the headquarters and divisions located in countries all over the world
would use the expensive system so as to be sure it can decipher all
messages from all machines.)
discuss uses with others who have had experience with the equipment for various functions; and finally, spend time to allow my brain to reach a logical conclusion.
the unsupported technical conclusions of laymen - laymen with no education
or experience in even basic design of electronic communication equipment
much less the kind of specialized electronic communication equipment
referred to in this case.
Based on what I have learned about this case, I believe this was a setup,
designed to result in the arrest of Mr. Daggett.  There was absolutely no
intent or effort on his part to violate any law; in fact, material I have
in hand indicates that he and his partner had frequently asked law
enforcement people and even a US Attorney to tell them if any of their
equipment fell into the Title III category (primarily useful for...), and
were always answered ambiguously.  Mr. Daggett was the target, and men who
were being pressured to do so by law enforcement authorities arranged to
meet him in a place that had been prewired so as to videotape the whole
activity while they pressured him into assembling the equipment and turning
it on - while not a word was spoken about any illegal use of the equipment.
Perfectly legal equipment can be used illegally.  An ordinary hammer can
be used to kill someone, but that doesn't mean it is primarily useful for
killing a person.  The bayonet I was issued in WWII, on the other hand, is
designed for just that purpose and no other.  In this case, serious
consideration should be given to the "primarily useful for" clause.  Is
someone interested in illegally eavesdropping on cellular conversations
going to buy  a $100 scanner or an instrument designed to fight cellular
toll fraud that costs thousands of dollars?
I have no idea whether the following thoughts are material, but I present
them because, as a legal layman, I regularly wonder about the uneven
application of some criminal laws.  For instance, while Jude Daggett is in
jail for possibly having sold a Title III piece of equipment:
the Martins (who said they had monitored and recorded Newt's conference
call that Rep Boehner was on with his cellular) were fined $500 each for
the deliberate illegal recording and distribution of a cellular phone
conversation.  Where's the justice?
Westinghouse (and a raft of other companies) advertise Title III
equipment regularly and continuously.  In that such advertising is also
proscribed by 18 USC 2512, I wonder how they get away with it.  Does our
federal law enforcement shy away from the bigger companies because they
have bigger budgets to defend themselves with?  Where's the justice?
Finally, let me go back to my original comments about this law.  It is so
ambiguous as to be farcical.  Examples:
It uses the word "intercept" incorrectly so it has to contain a special
definition of it.  It refers to "audio subcarrier" a complete nonsensical combination of
words - audio is sound, a longitudinal wave and subcarrier must be RF, a
transverse wave.  It could even be interpreted in some circumstances to mean it is a
federal crime to "intentionally" listen to Muzak while on an elevator or on
hold on the telephone.
POST SCRIPT
Additional Considerations.  Since writing the letter above, I have
continued thinking about that silly law.  Sure, the legislators will tell
you they passed it to protect our privacy.  That's hogwash.  If they were
honest, they would have listened to Bob Grove when he was invited to
testify.  Instead they pilloried him, accusing him of all kinds of nasty
Had they listened to him, or to anyone with education and experience in
this field, they would have heard that the law is unenforceable.  That
which has been broadcast  by radio will be monitored by parties other than
the intended receiver.  Unless encryption or some modern modulation
techniques are used, every broadcast can be monitored - despite the lies of
the sellers.
Two more possible lines for the defendants to take:
  I am an expert and allowed, therefor, to offer an opinion in court
testimony.  However, when I have offered an opinion, I have buttressed it
with arguments and even demonstrations.  I doubt the lawyers who have
expressed opinions as facts have done, or even can do, the same.  There is
nothing in their writings other than unsupported conclusions.
2.  I think a careful evaluation of the words in the law and the
legislative history might lead to the conclusion that the " communication"
referred to by the law writers is solely communication between humans.  If
that's so, the operation of the specific item should be carefully examined.
For instance, the cellular monitoring systems print out tons of
communication between the CMTs and the MTSOs (cellular mobile telephones
and mobile telephone switching offices).  Line after line on the printout
specifies the status of all active CMTs in its area, and the details of
what number called what number, etc. etc.  If these things primarily
monitor machine communications, can they be called "primarily useful for
surreptitious interception of {human} communications?
TWO POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS
  The congress could pass a new law - one based on inputs from people
who know what they're talking about and have the interests of our citizens
in mind.  (The elements of this law that cover monitoring [the law calls it
"intercepting"] of radio broadcasts is not necessary.  47 USC 705 has
served us well for many years, and makes sense.)    As long as the stupid law stays on the books, the federal government
should establish a qualified, non-government body of experts to rule on
what is and what is not a Title III device or system. This would allow
manufacturers and dealers to know who they can sell to.
James A. Ross
+++Moderator's Note+++
I agree with Ross. The law IS unclear and can result in select prosecution of anyone who manufactures Title III equipment OR ANY TYPE of communication equipment that could POSSIBLY be used for interception...
Several years ago I asked a personal friend who was the BOSS of a "three Letter agency" (Federal) in New York City for clarification of TITLE III because I had developed a new surveillance device and wanted to manufacture and sell...
My friend told me (after checking with Justice Department Legal Counsel) that there was "no license" which would "hold harmless" a "surveillance device" manufacturer or distributor. That they operated at the discretion of the government and could be indicted at any time... He advised me (as a friend) against developing the new device since I could be indicted for simply offering it for sale to "bona fide" law enforcement agencies...
The fact of the matter is "certain" companies that are on the "in" thrive while circulating "false" data about competition and "dropping dimes" to the feds to cause competitors "problems"...
Ma Bell should also be indicted as well as MANY other companies for "manufacturing" devices which allow the "interception" of communications...
See how stupid this gets?...
This type of case affects us ALL... I hope the list will support Daggett and Walz and let there Congressman know about this farce... [Security List info deleted.  ]

Three weaknesses in your scheme come to mind:
The bank could turn you in if you cash in the digicash (i.e. sting
operation would be to track a certain piece of digicash). So you'd have to
pass it on to others and not spend it.  Failing that, the LEA's would then try to blast your reputation by saying
they are Joe Dimebag and that they sent you money, but you ripped them
off.  They do this enogh times, your rep goes down the tubes and everyone
will fear sending you e$.  If not the LEA's then your competitors, etc.
Third hack into your scheme: someone with loads of digicash and loads of
time (LEA, who else?) could buy lots and lots from you.  Eventually a
physical pattern would show itself in your drop boxes.  If you ever reuse
a drop location, you could easily be nabbed.
As long as the goods you deliver are physical, the above are huge factors
and make it not worth your while to do.

I'd keep those.  Never know what they might be worth to a computer junk

You got it.  Compression won't happen.  But you can compress the data
before you encrypt it.  i.e.  use PKZIP or whatever to zip up your data to
a nice big zip file, encrypt the zip file with PGP or whatever, and backup
just the zip file.  (I'd do all this on an encrypted volume and set the
temp variable also to the encrypted volume so you won't have data
fragments leaking all over your drive in plain text for the spooks to
snarf up later.)
All the DAT drives I've seen are SCSI.  There are internal ones out there.
I'd stay away from the weird ones like HP or Sony, and get some generic
one.  Get a DDS2 drive if you can.
Run them through a degauser several times then auction them off or

Okay, so if format and fdisk won't get to it, then it must live in the
master boot record - (otherwise how would it run?)  Booting off a floppy
and running FDISK /MBR would wipe it.  If not, then a low level format
would.  If you lack the software for a low level wipe then a program that
zaps every sector of a drive including the MBR, and partition table would
fix it.  (If it lived on the boot sector than replacing it with the SYS
command would be possible.  If it lives in any other area, it can't
Installing Linux with Lilo in the MBR would also zap it.  Can it work with
other operating systems?  Say NT, or Solaris x86, Linux, or OS/2?  It's
useless if someone can simply install a non-compatible OS.  If it still
works with other OS's, then it only runs durring the bootup processes.
Which means that you simply don't plug your modem on the phone line while
you boot up and that's that.  If it's only compatible with Win95 or DOS,
then you install NT or Linux, or Solaris, and that will bypass it.
[The other (unlikely) possibility is that it would live in the BIOS for
FlashBIOS machines, but this is not likely since if it were to go there,
chances are there would be bugs and incompatibilities between their
software and the BIOS that would damage the computer. ]
The 1st thing a smart theif would do is to remove the modem from the
notebook computer and sell it separatly.  That way until the sucker with
the stolen notebook buys and uses a modem, he's untraceable.  And he can
sell the modem to someone else.
What if the notebook HASN'T been reported as stolen?  Then this software
can be used to track the location of the notebook computer, and as such it
is a privacy intrusion device.  I don't want some piece of software, even
if it protects my computer from theft to report on where I am at a given
time.  It is none of Computrace's business.
As for the silent modem functionality, I can simply attach a phone monitor
on the line.  A simple $19 box from RadioShack that hooks up to a tape
recorder can be hooked up to a powered speaker.  If the theif hears the
notebook dial the phone, he'd know it's there.
In any case, I'm not as worried about notebook loss as I am about the data
on it, so having a good hard drive encryptor is more valuable to me than
losing $2K for a notebook computer.  I don't trust this hackish bit of
software, especially if it will keep tabs on my location when the thing
isn't stolen.
(And yes I have that same sentiment about the LoJack car transponder, and
the EZ-Pass toll paying system, and cell phones.  Each of these
technologies can report on your whereabouts and thus pinpoint your
location at any given time.  They're all invasion of privacy things that
the masses are suckered into buying for either protection or convenience.
Uncool stuff.  I'd rather get comprehensive theft insurance, and pay tolls
in cash. FYI: I do have a cell phone, but I keep it off so it can't
transmit anything when I'm not using it.  Of course toll boths take pix
of the licensplates that pass by, but that's something I've no control

My point exactly.  Why should anyone have access to my machine or my
records and be able to pass it on to others?  Sure the insurance companies
will squeal that they should have access to my DMV and health records, but
should they have the right to take that info and pass it on publically?
What recourse do you feel you should have?
What would YOU do if someone did post all your personal info online?
things like credit records, home address, phone number, DMV records,
health records and such?  What would you WANT to do?  And what control do
you currently have over this?
Mind you, with your credit card info, any one of the "ankle biters" of the
Bevis & Butthead mentality would be able to purchase a dozen toilets and
have them shipped to your home, and other such abuses.  Or report all your
credit cards stolen right before you decide to entertain someone to dinner
and find you can't pay for it... etc...  These are all well known pranks.
Do you see my point and why I'm vehemently opposed to yours?
Or do you believe that "Oh, I have nothing to hide, I'm a good person and
have nothing to fear from anyone?"

That would be nice.  You should have put that in your article.
But here you have a choice, you can chose to not accept that job or attend

choice have you to control TRW or the DMV's, or your criminal records if
you have any?  Those aren't on your computer.
You can always attend the classes under assumed names.  This has been done

It's still early in the morning.  I'm sure the thread will explode pretty
soon. Yes, but what about the information that others can get to on your
ISP?  Do you control that info?  We've always advocated protecting our own
data, but this doesn't mean that we should invade the privacy of those who
are clueless, or suck it in when some rogue piece of software (see the
netscape thread) endagers our privacy. I'm not saying pull your shades up and stand butt naked infront of your

your home without your knowledge and then publish pictures of you in

I still disagree, and not just online.  There is plenty of information
that you have no control over but should.  Your credit card transactions
for instance can be looked up by any scumbag willing to pay money to TRW
and it's ilk.  Your DMV records, your health records.  In theory only
those that need to know this knowledge should be able to access it, and in
practice what have we seen so far? If I give XYZ corp any info I expect them not to sell that info without my
permission.  Verily, that information is valuable, therefore if they want
to sell it, they should get my permission, and should pay me for it.
I don't necessarily want government restrictions on privacy, however I
would want a constitutional amendment to privacy that says: all I do is
private unless I explicitly share it with others, and if I do share it,
they may not pass it on to others without my permission.  This is on a
personal level, not on a corporate or governmental level.  Why I feel this
way is an excercise for the reader.  Hint: Uncle Sam works for us since we
pay him from our income.  We don't work for him (most of the time.)
How many loons have used DMV records to stalk their victims?
How about the nice Netscape hole that allows sites to surf your hard drive
as you're surfing their sites?
Yes, I do take privacy seriously, and I do protect it.  But to say anyone
has the right to snoop my machines and see what I have there is NOT cool.
What I leave on my computer is my private business, and NOBODY HAS THE
RIGHT TO SURF IT WITHOUT MY PERMISSION.  Whether or not they have root.
As for Radio Shack weasels, I don't give them info, or give them
misleading info.  What's on my hard drives and in my machine's RAM is NONE
OF ANYONE'S BUSINESS!
At the last PC Expo, I registered as H.P. Lovecraft.  When I buy things
that are purchased by credit card I know that info will leak out, and
don't do this unless I'm willing to leak it out.
So, I still disagree with your view.  Even after reading the whole

that I believe there should be a constitutional right to privacy in terms
of shared information - a built in Non Disclosure Agreement between all
interactions.  One does not exist, IMHO it should. If I chose to speak in public - as in this forum, I expect that my words
will not be private.  That's a given.  If I speak to XYZ Bank and apply
for a loan or credit card, I want that information to be private.
If I purchase a printed magazine, the publisher doesn't expect me to scan
it in and post it on the net, free for all to access.  In fact, if I were
to do that and persist in doing it, I would get sued for copyright
I don't believe in software patents, but I do believe in copyright.  I
believe that what I do, or say should be copyrighted by default.  This
includes spending patterns, and such.  Very much ideal and non-reality,
yes, but it is my belief still.  I also believe Congress shouldn't be
populated by a bunch of money and power hungry slime bags.  That is also
ideal to me, but a non-reality.  Doesn't mean I shouldn't believe it, nor
does it mean I shouldn't have the right to disagree with someone that says
"Congress should be populated by weasels." Nor do I believe that TRW or the DMV should have the ability to sell my
information to others without my permission, or collect it for that matter
without a contrat that states how it will be used and who it will be
shared with. Can you name one Credit Card company that DOES NOT share its
info with TRW?  Yes, I can get a debit card, but information about
transactions on it will wind up in the hands of TRW.
That would be an ideal. Unfortunatly, I have been forced to give up some
privacy for things like credit cards and a driver's license.  I don't see
that I've had any other choice than to give up the ability to drive and
purchase things without having to carry large sums of cash.  I was forced
into giving up privacy.  Same as you I suspect.  That doesn't mean I agree
with the system.  It means I didn't have any other choice given basic
needs.  It doesn't mean that given the chance to change it by voting, I
wouldn't. Back to the strawman beatings:
I later cited the Netscape hole (or feature if you are paranoid) as an
example of something that could escape my machine and stated that whether
or not I secure my machine, if information escapes it by such methods, my
privacy has been violated.  This was given as a hypothetical example of
protecting one's privacy, yet still having it violated by leaks.
I cannot verify that Netscape's browser won't violate my security.  I am
forced to put some level of trust in it if I chose to use it.  Were I to
ask a Netscape representative whether their software were secure before
this bug/feature was discovered, would they say no?  Sure, I could use IE
or some other browser, but unless I carefully analyze the source code, I
wouldn't know if it had holes.  This paragraph is moot and I'm sure you
understand all this already.
The keyword here is "leaks."  It doesn't imply with permission.  It
implies the opposite; and here is where I brought the Netscape bug as an
example of a flaw in your thinking.  If they, whether on purpose or not,
have the ability to snarf anything my browser is willing to give them
without my permission, this too is a breech of my privacy.  In this
example, even though I have taken precautions to disable cookies and
DIDN'T enter information as to my email identity, it is still possible to
grab it off my hard drive without my permission.  Ditto for the ActiveX component that those German hackers wrote to grab
info out of Quicken. Was it the fault of the person surfing that some dork
at Microsoft misdesigned their software?  And because of that, some hacker
got my credit cards and went shopping?  What recourse do I have against
that happening once it does?
How do these breeches fit into your ideals?  You can brush them off and
say "oh, those were bugs or flaws" but privacy has still been violated.
How do you feel they should be dealt with?
Shall we accept rogue software, and Big Brother Inside software as mere
flaws?  True, Netscape will say these were unintentional.  But if they
weren't, -- if they were intentional, would we stand for them and accept
Earlier I asked you a similar line of questions, which you haven't yet
answered (at the time of this writing.)  Again, what recourse do you feel
you should have against such invasions of your privacy?  What
protection(s) do you feel you should have? (Other than stating, if you
don't want it to leak, don't let it - for which I've shown you plenty of
examples of exceptions.)
In yet another message you've stated "chmod 700 ~" as a cure.  Very funny.
A whole lot of good that would do against someone who obtained root, or
managed to grab my ISP's backup tapes, etc...  Doesn't mean I do not
understand that my ISP can't do this.  Doesn't mean Mitnick won't get
out of jail and break into my account.  It means I don't want them to.
Sorry, I still chose to DISAGREE with you.  You might be able to convince
me otherwise with logic, but you won't be able to do so with words such as
"clueless" and "if you only read the whole thing." (Granted the same does
apply to me using the "Fuck you" subject, but hey, free speech and all
that. :) .+.^.+.|  Ray Arachelian    | "If you wanna touch the sky, you must  |./|\.

@_subject: FUCK YOU: There's no general right to privacy -- get over it, from Netly 
So, say that someone got your DMV records, found out where you lived, and
murdered you.  Would your family be able to sue the DMV?  Sure it's public
knowledge, but should it be?  Should breeches of privacy be limited to
"Breaking and Entering" or "hacking?"  Isn't the fundemental problem not
simply trespassing, but rather invasion of privacy?  If I broke into your house, but didn't touch and thing, and didn't damage
anything, I'd still be trespassing, but would you mind?  If so, why?  I'd
bet because it invades your privacy, because it wasn't with your
permission. That's the root violation.  Trespassing is a side issue.
If the tree does fall in the forrest and no one hears it fall, it has
still fallen.  Whether it makes a noise is a question for Zen students. That it has fallen is unquestionable.   So I break into your house and
leave no traces and you don't know about it, would you care? What if I release the pictures of your house to the world?  What if I take
them using a telephoto lens from a distance?  What if I use IR scans of
your house to see what you're doing?  Or use microwaves bouncing off
metal objects, or IR lasers bouncing off your windows to listen in? At
what point does it become an invasion of privacy?  And what point would
you say I've gone too far?
Personally, I'd say it's too far when someone's going through my trash and
parking a van outside my house.  But that's my oppinion.
If they are public records that were generated with my consent.  And yes,
I do agree with the above paragraph.  It's a big IF though.  But do I
consent to the DMV giving out my info?  Would I consent to the IRS giving
out my tax return?  Would I consent to TRW giving out credit reports to
anyone who is willing to pay the $50?  Not fucking likely.  Doesn't mean I
have any choice in the matter.  At no point did I sign any piece of paper
telling TRW they have the right to give out my info to anyone willing to
cough up the money.
Depends on what that info is and how it was obtained.  If your dossier
contains my credit cards, I can turn around and sue you, even though you
might have paid TRW to get that info or whatever.
If my phone number is unlisted and I share it with my CC company, and they
in turn release it to TRW, and you get it from them and post it to the
world, then I could sue my CC company, but it would be too late.  Sure, I
protect my info, but if someone didn't respect that, what recourse do I
have against them?  Once the info is out, it's out.
Depends on what that information is.  There are robot rule files for your
web site that say "Don't catalog this," and web masters do get pissed if
it does.  Public postings are public. This is granted.  I'm not saying
what I write in public is considered private.  I chose to retain copyright
on it, but waive the distribution restrictions. This is granted. Further, if you are making money off my information, and if that
information was not publically available, but you sell it, should I not
have the right to get a slice of your profits - assuming I even agree to
let you sell it?
The question is, should you have the right to collect info that I do not
relese to others publically, and make it public.  After all, if not for
protecting our privacy, what reasons would we need encryption?  What
reasons would we have for the existance of cypherpunks were not cyphers
ultimatly useful in obtaining privacy?  For the coolness of their
mathematical properties only?  For signatures only? Not fucking likely. Ask yourself why you favor the use cyphers, Tim.  If you don't say
"privacy" then get the fuck off this list.  Ditto for Declan.  (Of course,
this can't apply to the NSA since they have a different agenda on this
list, but that too is a given.) :)
I must admit, I am surprised at you, but no I don't robospam folks, and I
wouldn't borrow one from Vulis.
Perhaps you can turn around and say "Ray's on the rag" or "gone loony",
but I do feel strongly that information that I share with others should be
kept private unless I say so.  Ditto for "private" email.  (Quotes placed
to indicate how easily it is for bad folks to snoop unencrypted email.)
Perhaps I may be overly sensitive to the issue because Vulis (you did
bring his name up, so live with it) posted whatever public information he
could gain in a nice easily digestible package - much like Tim's Dossier
Service could and threated to send my employers weird email, and in the
same postings posted racist crap, but that was only PUBLICALLY available
info.  I retaliated by doing the same, but imagine how pissed I would be
were this info that wasn't publically available - like credit card
numbers, tax return info, etc... So yes, you can say, you need to live in a society that is free and open,
and yes, I can disagree with you and say you're scum for thinking that you
can freely collect info I consider private and then sell it.  It is after
all my right to disagree with this, and my right to freely say that I do. And of course this is a publically posted message, so go ahead and place
it in your dossier. :)

Should it include your address and phone number?
Then we don't live in an open and free society.  Do we have open records
into what the CIA and NSA and such do? etc.?  Very few. But should the public know Joe's phone number and address and date of
birth?  Gee, weren't we screaming this sucks to easily accessible Texas
DMV records a few days ago?
See CIA comment above.  What of the likes of TRW, and health records?
Should these be open knowledge to anyone who is a credit card agent or
health insurance co?  If it is vital to have this info to keep the
governments in check, why does the government have privacy?  If the
government has privacy, why shouldn't we?  Neither do we, nor the
government have absolute privacy, however, the government controls the
information it deems to keep private.  Why should we not do the same?
Should detailed building plans be made available of all buildings so that
theives can look at them and break into banks more easily?  Perhaps there
are reasons some of these things are available to the public.  Perhaps
there are reasons why not all should be.

I'm making the case that information I share with (for example) the DMV
should not be viewable by those OUTSIDE of the DMV and NYPD without my
consent - i.e. if Joe Insurance Inc. wants to insure my car, they need my
permission to have the DMV release the info; but some folks have taken
this to other weird tangents, such as polarizing one's point of view into
either libertarian or stasist.  I hold neither.  And I've given up on the
cluelessness of the same folks, so the topic I've dropped. :) .+.^.+.|  Ray Arachelian    | "If you wanna touch the sky, you must  |./|\.

Well then, so much for asking the phone company to NOT list your number in
the phone book.  If someone wants to find you, all they have to do is
cough up some dough and register themselves as an insurance broker or
whatever and they can look at DMV records to get your phone number.
Thanks but no thanks.  You are being too dense on this.
NSA I'll grant you might be a straw man.  FBI and CIA records should be
open to all to read - except ongoing current stuff, but I don't mean that
they should be open 50 years after the fact.  Government abuses DO and
HAVE occured.  I neededn't cite things like Waco and Ruby Ridge, do I?
What threat were those events to National Security?
That is quite telling of your beliefs.
Why should I accept being pidgeonholed into one category or the other?
Get a clue.
Um yeah, sure, and if you've nothing to hide why ask for privacy right?
Why don't you like put cameras in your home and monitors on the street so
anyone who wants to listen in on you and watch you can do so?
There should be no privacy issue.  Privacy should be a right as should the
right to use strong encryption WITHOUT GAK.  That is the point of strong
encryption without GAK after all: Privacy.  End of Story.

Thanks for the compliment.  I burp in your general direction.
Asking the state to protect my privacy by not disclosing the information I
disclose to it is not asking the state to engage in secret activities with
select members of society.  It is asking it not to release information
that I am forced to give them in return for certain goods, services, or
privilidges - driving for example.  Having a driver's license doesn't mean
I wish to share the information that the DMV requires to provide such a
license to the world.
Paying taxes doesn't mean I wish to disclose my 1040 form to the world.
And tell me dear William, in what way will you prevent the government from
taking capricious actions against a free and open society by allowing
anyone to find out a phone number that is unlisted by simply calling up
DMV records?
This isn't keeping tabs on the government, this is keeping tabs on the
people which the government choses to infringe on.
If the DMV wasn't giving licenses to certain types of people and one
believed that this was the case, one should ask those people who felt that
they were discriminated against.  One should not have the ability to look
at EVERY record in the DMV databases - no matter how noble the thought.
This is not to protect the DMV, this is to protect those listed within its
Again, by your oppinion, not mine.  And no, I don't believe in a "free and
open" society.  I believe in a "free and private" society.
As for these, IMHO, once a criminal has completed their sentence they
should be allowed to have a life.  Having these records available to all
is a means of discriminating against them for having commited a crime as
judged by a jury.  Not necessarily having commited the crime, but being
convicted of doing so - as is well known mistakes have been made and lives
have been destroyed by such mistakes.
IMHO, repeat offenders will wind up in jail again, and will be punished
again.  This should not infringe on their right to secure jobs or the
right to rent, or buy homes.
The idea of the justice system is to correct these wrongs, not to punish
for life.  Once the debt is paid, it is paid.  There are some who believe
that offenders should not be re-released into society because they will
commit more crimes, and/or that the communities should be notified when
they are allowed to move there.  If it is the case that person X is likely
to commit more crime, then that fact should play a factor in person X's
parole hearing.  IMHO, if the danger is there, don't let the bastard out.
If it isn't, then let them go and let them live in peace and privacy.
These too can be both a benefit and an infringement on privacy.  Whatever
information these records hold might be used for other purposes.
Why?  What is the purpose of having these records available in forms other
than a number?
I agree here.
Sure, but only so far as to say "Yep, person X has this license" not "and
they live on xyz street, have three kids, and a poodle."
Granted, but which specific records?
clue: You mean etc as in "Et Cetera."
I agree that there is ALSO a problem that the government has its fat
fingers in everything and is allowed to do things that others aren't
allowed to do.  For instance many places where gambling is illegal provide
lotteries with astronomical odds against the player.  Were the things done
by casinos, nobody would play.
I agree that what the state does and whom they interact with should be
public knowledge.  I do not agree that by virtue of interacting with the
state that I should be force to give up my privacy.  I do not have the
choice of not interacting with the state due to lovelies such as income
taxes and drivers licenses - I should not be forced to give up privacy as well because of this.
Based on what you say everything the state does should be public.  Fine,
but if anyone were able to see anyone else's 1040 forms, you'd have a lot
of invasion of privacy.  This is what you fail to see or understand.  This
isn't a strawman, it's plain fact.  If I can see your return, I can see
how much you make, whatever deductions or exemptions you claim can give me
a slew of information as to what you have purchased and your general life
style.  The address info and SSN will give me even more keys into your
info.  Birth and Marriage records will tell me who your mother is, then I
can look up her records, and find her maiden name, then I can take your
SSN, your mother's maiden name, your date of birth and hand them over to
TRW and see your credit card purchases, etc.  This is the thing that
should not be that you are advocating, the thing I and fighting you on.  I
think that it is indeed the case that you require a few clues.
Then DMV records should not be fully visible, neither should 1040 forms,
for example.  But the key is "that do not directly involve the state"  The
problem is that the state directly involves us into their activities and
we directly involve them through our votes.  That is the key that will
unlock the records into the activities of the citizens, and unlock their
privacy when they should not.
For the most part we agree - the government's activities should be public
knowledge and should be watched and reviewed carefully.  However in your
eagerness to make this happen you would also strip away the privacy of the
citizens only because the government interacts and forces itself on
interacting with them.
And that is the clue you fail to get.

Gee thanks for quoting my entire message.  You know, I really love to see
the stuff I wrote before over and over again when I reply to it.  *NOT*.
If you reply, please don't quote the entire messages.  Just what you're
replying to.  [Mass Snippage]
Watch them carefully.  If they do what they're not supposed to do, word
will eventually leak out in most circumstances, not all, and most
certainly not in spool related things.  But leaks do occur.  Watching what
they say and do will give you that info.  Same as any of the reporters
will do.  Ask Declan if need be. :)
Conduct your own independant census and see how big a difference there is.
If you can't, then conduct random but smaller spot checks and see how they
match.  Count the number of entries in the phone book.  You shouldn't be
too far off from the actual number of residents within an area though
you'd be missing unlisted numbers.
Ask the voters to anonymously re-vote, take polls.  Etc.
These aren't done by Uncle Sam, they're done by AMA or whatever.  As I
said licenses should be available to you in terms of yes, he's had a
license, or no he ain't got one.
Court procedings, not criminal records.  Hmmm, caught me there ya did. :)
Good question.  Any other suggestions as to how to protect the privacy of
someone who served their time?
I'm not asking for laws to be passed to "protect" privacy.  I'm asking
that privacy be recognized as one of the inalienable rights.  In other
words, a constitutional amendment much like the 1st that says you have the
right to privacy.  Not necessarily what happens when it is broken.  If
it's broken, you sue Unlce Sam.
I'm not asking for public information to be hidden.  I'm asking for
information that is personal and should be private to be private- i.e. driving records, health records, addresses, phone numbers, and
relationship records to be kept private. I'm not asking to hide what the
government does.  Not all information that is public is personal - such information should
remain public.  The actions of the state, the actions of public
corporations should be public.  Information on citizens should not be made
public WITHOUT their consent.

Since your page claims it has been deemed exportable:
Which public key cypher does it use?  what key lengths are available for the public key cypher?
Which secret key cypher does it use?  If DES, which mode and how many rounds?
Which secure hash do you use on the passphrase to protect the private key?
Is there a stronger, non-export version?
Can the cyphers used by SecureFile be replaced by ones of our own design? (Say if I want to add RSA-2048, or DH, or Elliptic Curve PK cyphers, or
Idea, or Blowfish, or 3DES, or superencrypt with several secret key
Is it crippled in any way? Is source code available for review?
Any hooks for key recovery?  If someone loses their key can they get it back? You rely on Internet Exploer's DLLs to be available on your machines.  In light of the recent holes discovered will those affect your product? Which IE DLLs does your product use?
It's available for 95 and NT, that means an Intel version.  Have you got any Alpha, MIPS, or PPC versions for NT on those platforms?
How does your product compare to F-Secure's Desktop?
Why would we trust your product?

@_subject: VulisBOT FAQ 
Of course, this is more Vulisware generated bullshit.  How can you tell if Vulis is lying? He writes messages.
How does VulisWare operate?
VulisWare 1.0 is a lame AI spamming device whose only purpose in life is to generate havoc on mailing list.  As of this writing the VulisWare bot is only running on the cypherpunks list.
It generates rants, raves and lies about whomever it targets resorting to
ethnic, racist, homophobic, pedophiliac, dandruff oriented, and sometimes
outright outrageously bizzare made up stories.  These are selected by a
complex Pseudo RandomNumber Generator which uses its wife process's PMS
cycle as a seed. Failing that, it points out spelling errors.
It does net searches to find out info on the target, then posts the target's phone number, address, and employer info online asking that all spam the target and their employer. If that fails to have any effect, it sends its lies to the targets employers and calls up its target employer to find out information on them, or to slander them.
If it can't find out anything about the target, it makes up lies of outrageous proportions (such as quoted above) and posts them.  [Apparently the VulisBot has recently watched a Babylon 5, where the Big Lie algorythm is used agains B5 - of all things, the big lie issuers claimed those who run B5 had cryogenically frozen people.]
It keeps a database of lies used on each target, then repeats the lies over and over again - this is attributed to the KGB Big Lie Algorythm (TM of the KGB, copyrighted and patented by the KGB).  For those unfamiliar with this algorythm, the idea is that if you repeat a big lie enough times, people will believe it.
Because of this, it must constantly post anonymous - and tentacle versions of the same lie.  Following the tentacles of these other folks leads back to dm.com.
Further, one mutation of the VulisBOT is stuck in a loop posting small anonymous slander several times a day aimed at Tim May.
Anything the VulisBot says should carry the following warning "WARNING: The Surgeon General has determined that reading Vulis sent mail can cause stupidity, brain failure, and sometimes laughter.  At no time are you to believe anything sent by Vulis or its tentacles."
The VuisBot's only purpose in life is to cause havoc and chaos.  It gets pleasure from this.  At times if it is really bored, it will send huge texts of crap to the list in hopes of filling up the mailboxes of those subscribed to the list.
In truth, the VulisBot has only succeded to strengthen the  cypherpunks movement as several mailing lists have now been created.  Where originally there was one, there are now three!  VulisBot believes it is hurting the list.  In truth it is helping the cypherpunks movement, though granted it is causing much spam and noise, it has only made us Short of an accidental NYPD hollow point bullet striking by accident in
vecinity of 67-67 Burns Street, Forrest Hills, NY 11375 (718) 261-6839,
there is a known cure: To receive VulisFree mail (*) you may subscribed to
one of several filtered mailing lists.  Info on one such list is available
by pointing your web browser at  This list in particular has grealy grown in size due to VulisBot's
activities. Other cures: setup procmail or another mail filter and immediatly delete anything with the word Vulis in the header.
(*) Even though Vulis is known to be insane, as all insane people are known to, even Vulis occasionally (once in a blue moon) will post a coherent, sane, and useful message.  The filtered cypherpunks list reserves the right to forward such mail.  Granted, this almost never happens, do not be shocked if it does.

@_subject: Analysis of proposed UK ban on use of non-escrowed crypto. 
Sure there is.  The HR department of Big Well-known Company, Inc. can sign the employee's keys.  What's the problem?  If you want to order something you do so by generating a P.O. or by using a credit card.  What does the web of trust have to do with this?
If you need approval, it's simple, you ask for it.  When you get it, you order your 10,000 pencil erasers.  You don't have to use PGP signatures for orders, but you can if the infrastructure is there between both No shit.  Both are possible.  Whichever your company wants it will use.
I claimeth not lawyerhood, but IMHO, it can stand up in court if both parties agree to it by analog signatures infront of a notray.  Any lawyers care to comment?
Not if it is agreed by all parties involved and their lawyers to honor such signatures. (IMHO)
Really? you must not have been gotten infected by the slew of Word and Excel viruses out there.  Might be a very good lawsuit against Micro$oft that they allowed such things to happen.
Standards for a company are standards for a company.  Which standard has more weight or importance is up to that company.  Sure, it is on a bigger scale that installing XYZ OfficeWare and getting your ass fired, but it is still a standard.
Is there any reason that a specific company CAN'T decide to use PGP? (or PEM, or some other scheme) if it so choses?
So what's the problem?  You hire people to keep track of assigning, escrowing, and signing keys for your employees.  You have IS staff and security staff to watch for breeches.  You can automate tons of this with good written scripts that automatically scan all email for valid signatures and raise alarms when signatures don't match.
Where is this not useful?  For a small company a locked safe is plenty.  For a large company, you hire HR/Security folks to be your "Key Agents" or whatever.
Yeah, ditto.  We agree on this.  We also would want something sent offsite incase of nuke, flood, fire, or mass suicide. :-)  (sorry had to throw in a Heaven's Gate ref somewhere.)
Because there are laws that force such standards on the company.  So far are there any laws that say you can't use anything but DSA? (Or Clipper, or whatever NSA backed scheme d'jour is being pushed?)  If there were such laws in progress, they would be fought. :)
So we agree. :)
It would be cool by me to impose a minimum provided that the current state of
hardware could process such keys without too much of a delay factor, but not
a maximum.  If I am sick enough to want a 16384 bit RSA key, why force me to
use something lesser?
But within a company, were I insistent enough for whatever reason to use 384 bit RSA keys, as weak as they are and that was my company's policy I should be able to allow it.  (Just as employers can read email if you expect that you have no privacy on the company email system.)
Ours is a bit more paranoid.  We offsite a tape on the 15th and last day of every month.  Every few months we burn a pair of CD's of the important stuff, keep one in the local safe, one offsite.
It helps (looking at my own flame resistant shorts...)

Baltimore Technologies shipped the first copies of its Java
cryptography product J/CRYPTO at the Java Users Group meeting at
Communications '97. J/CRYPTO is the world's first cryptography class
library written entirely in Java and implements RSA, DES, Triple-DES,
SHA1, MD5, Diffie-Hellman and other common cryptographic functions. It
plugs into the Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) and will comply
with Sun's Java Cryptography Extension (JCE).
J/Crypto includes a range of Java classes including: highly optimized Multi-Precision Arithmetic Modules;
cryptographically secure Pseudo-Random Number Generation; RSA
key generation & encryption; SHA-1 & MD5 Hashing; DES and
Triple-DES encryption; Diffie Hellman Key Exchange Mechanism.
J/Crypto includes many advanced features which provide commercial
grade security for applications. These features include:
full-strength key sizes (512,1024, 2048 bit RSA keys, 112-bit
Triple-DES); fast format RSA keys (Chinese remainder theorem &
Fermat-4); eeeelimination of weak & possibly weak DES & RSA keys;
bfuscation of secret keys and other sensitive data;
compatibility with PKCS      sample applications
and benchmarking.
Future developments for J/CRYPTO include implementation of Secure
Sockets Layer (SSL), IDEA, RC2, RC4, BSA4, BSA5 ciphers and a range of
high-speed stream ciphers.

@_subject: Building a Tempest Interceptor (fwd) 
This was on the Surveillance List...
by Frank Jones
aka SpyKing at thecodex.com
Copyright 1997
The is very little public knowledge about TEMPEST. Most infomation, including how to safeguard against monitoring, has been classified by the government.  You can view an article I wrote on TEMPEST at:  and another at: In order to protect computers and CRT�s from electromagnetic emission monitoring (interception, recontruction and viewing) it is necessary to use shielding. This shielding is available in several forms but that is another article... Once the shielding is installed, how do you test it for leakage? It is necessary to see if you can monitor the device yourself.  Since TEMPEST monitoring equipment is normally very expensive and hard to come by, here is a simple way to construct a �simple� monitoring device that will help you detemine if your computer can be �snooped� on by outside sources... this device was designed for �defensive� purposes and should NOT be used offensively... it does not have the distance capability of my DataScan device but it WILL work as a laboratory benchtop demo device...
Like Van Eck and Moller, I have deliberately flawed the article for the technically challenged... After all, we don�t want everyone to have one of these, do we?
TEMPEST Interceptor - Follow my instructions...
You need to learn something about electronics to make this happen. The first lesson will be to construct a sync generator to drive the computer monitor without any signal or video. To start this you must take your spectrum analyzer, turn off every appliance in the area. Put the analyzer near the computer monitor, turn on the monitor but NOT the computer. Start searching around 15Khz. You should get a strong signal somewhere between 14Khz & 17Khz. Log that frequency. Next try looking around 30Hz to 60Hz. Which is stronger 30 or 60?  Log that. Next we�re gonna build a �computer sync generator�  (video gear will not work). Most technician�s who have tried to build a TEMPEST interceptor have been trying to use �off-the-shelf� products. Don't believe what you read or hear, they won't work. You�ve got to build a computer sync generator. It isn't really so hard to do. Get yourself a copy of the "CMOS Cookbook". It's around.  In there it shows how to build a 555 timer. It is a small and simple circut. Maybe 5 components. The 555 has in it all the clock and electronics to make a timer from 1Hz to 10Mhz. Follow the instructions and make a variable timer (it is really simple).  Make the first one run at the exact frequency of the monitor, say 16 Khz. Next make a seperate one at the second frequency say 30 Hz. Then tie them together with a .o1 Mfd cap. The output should drive your monitor (generator is done).
Two minor things I forgot to mention. The output of the 555 is about 5 to 12 volts. You will need to attenuate it to about .3 volts. Several resistors will do.
The other thing is that you need a negative pulse out of the 555. The normal output of a 555 is a square wave. On and off . You must vary the duty cycle to create a square wave which is most of the time on and the sync duration off.  You now need a seperate dedicated computer monitor. Open the input plug and find the shielded cable inside. Attach the output of your circut to the center-conductor and the battery minus from your circut to the shield. You have a solid black screen on the monitor. Turn up the brightness. There should be no rolling and weaving. If so... adjust the pot in YOUR CIRCUIT not the monitor, to stop it.  Next step. Collect the signal you hear and see on your anaylzer/receiver. Take the output of your reciever tuned to those frequencies. Connect the output through a .01 mfd cap to the output of the sync generator and �viola� you should start to see the monitors radiated signal on your monitor. Shielding your viewing monitor from the recieving monitor and small adjustments in your generator frequency should do it. In fact no adjustments should still do it. The antenna that you use is critical. Make sure you use the right one...  ;-)

I'd predict that in such cases mom & pop candy stores and small grocery stores wouldn't bother with record keeping, while big huge stores with marketting spam budgets would.
Though all things considered some record keeping is needed for inventory tracking, employee pay, etc.

Fictionally speaking, if the Prof. (when did I earn that title?) does hack Cyberpromo, the Prof wouldn't delete all the files, for doing so would simply cause them to restore their files from tape thus cause not much to happen.  No, were I to do something like that (and I wouldn't) it would have to be something that would keep them down for a long time, not for eight hours while their tape drive restores stuff.
Any suggestions as to what this would be for those out there willing to do
such a deed? :) My own suggestion would be to hack into the routers
surrounding them and set them up to connect any attempts to connect to
machines outside cyberpromo.com on port 25 back to cyberpromo's own sendmail
server.  Setting up their sendmail configs to do the same would also be a
nice backup.  That would be IMHO a proper hack.  (Anyone care to share router
hacking techniques, and how to do such a thing?-- Again, not that I would do this myself.)

A very Zen answer (and quite a slippery one at that.) What if Igor was simply curious as to your views?
If not what difference does it make whether he supports or opposes your view? We are all free to our own opinions.  Why do you care whether or not a
person is enlightened by your response?  If you truly are following Zen, then
it is not for you to decide what will or won't enlighten others since this would mean taking responsability for another person's karma.
IMHO, your response isn't one of potentially enlightening others, but rather
fear of sharing your opinion.  This is two fold.  If you fear he will oppose
it, you are seeking the approval of others. If you fear he will agree to it,
you fear that those who oppose his views will oppose yours.  You could take
the hidden third option and claim privacy, however it is too late to do so
since you have already shared some commentary - and thus this path is closed
to you.
Your responses so far were to the ethical and moral standards of spamming the
spammers.  I wasn't interested in such.  I am comfortable with my own morals
and take responsability for my actions.  However, the point of this paragraph
is that you have tried to share with us your morals, and thus thrust them
upon us, later, here, you say you lack the will to share your views with us,
and thus back out of passing judgement on our hypothetical actions.
And at this point I am no longer interested in your oppinion on this matter for it is jaded by fear, so please, don't even bother to reply. :)

Yeah, and he's applied a patent on the idea of /dev/null. Since it produces zeros, he plans to sue every unix var on the planet for patent infringement right after he gets the patent.  (Little does he know about EOF - but soon as he gets a clue, he'll sue on the concept of EOF as He's working on a beta of a program that produces 1's.  That's  secret project he's working on next. :)

Exception1: Unless you are fragmenting incoming data into chunks equal to or smaller than the size of your static buffer less 1 byte for the NUL character terminator. :)
Lemma1: Never assume anything about incoming data sizes, or formats.  Example: The SBM client being able to do the equivalent of "cd .." on the root level of an NT share.
Lemma2: Always make sure when expecting data to time out if you do not receive what you expect.  Example: telnet to port 135 of unpatched NT server 4.0, type 10 characters, hit ENTER and disconnect.

Filtering isn't the point.  Just as you have the right to free speech, you also have the right to ignore someone else's speech as it is aimed at you.  If you don't want Cyberspammo to spam you, they should honor your request to take their crap elsewhere.
The problem I have with them is that while they do say "Send email here to never be spammed again" it doesn't work.  They don't honor the deletion requests.  You wind up on some other dweeb's spam queue also from cyberspam. :(

Agreed.  While I will restrain my oppinions of our unfriendly KOTM with a doctorate from the KGB, I'm tired of these spams.  Yes, they include the ones that IMHO come from Vulis, the ones to which Graham replies, the anonymous ones that reply to Graham, the permutations of them that spam Toto, and these.  :(
If you want to rag on Tim or Vulis, please do so, but not by setting up spam bots.  Granted some of those are funny the first time you see them, but automating them makes them as welcome as listening to an annoying fly buzzing over and over in your face.
Hell, the nice bomb making spam too is also a bitch being posted here.  One could give the poster the benefit of the doubt, but it smells quite of the tactics used by the Postal fiends that mail child porno to an unsuspecting citizen unit, then arrest that citizen unit upon receipt.  Lets not give the evil onesof the government more horsemen to ride over us. :(  A url to the stuff and a summary would have sufficed.  (And I'll restrain myself from saying that this was done by Vulis, though IMHO, it smells of his style of spam. :)

To elaborate:
Point is that in every one of their posts that I've gotten they have a "send email to this address with subject cancel" only it doesn't do shit.   They place something that makes it look like they will not spam you if you ask them not to, but they do anyway.
Yeah, they use the "cancel" messages to send you more spam instead of shutting off all spam.  This is called false advertising, no?
If you want to take it further in to the land of the creatures of theory, who owns your email?  Do you?  If so, by right of ownership can you decide who isn't to send you email?  You can certainly achieve this by filters.  If the spamming scum says "I will stop if you ask me to" and you ask him to stop, but he doesn't, what rights have you got against him?  What if he is using your email for commercial purposes without your consent? etc.....

If you can't come up with anything entertaining like you used to, don't bother.  You're repeating yourself like the broken KGB mouthpiece that you are.  To quote Monty Python "I fart in your general direction.  Your mother was a hamster, and your father smelt of elderberries."

Of course.  That would be the perfect time for it.  Martial Law and all that.  Oppose it and you get thrown in jail...  or labeled a spy or something...  What else is new?  Declare martial law, then put the screws in.  Once in place they're almost imposible to remove without leaking loads of blood.
Welp, go for it.  Do whatever you think is appropriate to undo the law.  I'd bet the people will agree with you, but the political scum that is, will not, nor is it likely that the media will allow you to speak your words. More likely weird allegations of child molestation, drug abuse, and plans of A.P. will "leak" out, and possibly a Jim Bell style raid on your house. :)  Asking your kongress kritter to undo this law is unlikely to result in much more than laughter.  So where does that leave you?
*Burp* Sorry, I'm too busy with living my life to do a Heaven's Gate special. :)  Since the money is taken out before we even see it, most people won't fight it, since it is already gone.
Well, then organize the many to do something if that is your wish.  Nothing is holding you back.
I myself consult out.  Consulting out means that the money isn't taken out at all.  You just have to pay it back come April 15.  Day job, being a full time job, money gets taken out automagically by the evil agents of the IRS critters.  Consulting money, come the 1099 form, gets taxed So even if you manage to upturn this law and get to keep the money until April 15, it wouldn't affect me much.  IMHO it's much easier if the money gets withheld, then having to pull hairs out doing tax forms come April.
Now if you can somehow repeal income tax, that would be a useful achievement. :)
I'm not opposed to taxes.  I'm opposed to their use without my say.  That is I want to tell Uncle Sam where the money goes.  If I decide my 30% that they chop out goes to the next stealth bomber, then that is where it should go.  If I say it should go to the schools, then that is where it should go, etc.  You think them kongress kritters will accept such a thing?  And no, not one cent of my "voluntary" contribution would go to kongress, were I to have it my way.  Hell, if I could even decide on 1/2 of that, it would still be progress.
IMHO, this is nothing but a pipe dream, and I don't have any interest in politics.  I've too many other concerns to deal with.
But do whatever you feel is appropriate.  That in a nutshell was my opinion.  *Burp*
In the case of taxes, Uncle Sam
For a billion things such as stealth bombers, for kogress salaries, for
bullets, for $3K military issue toilets that will survive nuke blasts, roads,
toll bridges, tax forms, black budget stuff, shipments to other countries,
jails, new draconian laws, bribe money, money to pay the prostitutes at the
congressional parties, "Just Say No" anti drug campains, trading coke for
guns, etc, etc, etc... Welp, that's simple.  Quit your job and become homeless.  If you don't produce any money, they can't take any away from you.  They certainly can't put you in jail for it, and hell if they do, guess what, you get free food and a free place to sleep, and a big boyfriend named 'Bubba to keep you warm and fuzzy at night.
Work for the mob or something equally salacious, or get paid in cash and say you're unemployed, then go on welfare while you work, etc...
So put your mind to it and do something about it instead of yapping about it to us.  We don't give a shit.  If we did, we would have done something about it already.
A few years back, the men in white would be called with a padded wagon, or

Yeah, and I have the root password for the machines I've installed and run.  Whoop Whoop.

Hey, I have a bottle of Tabasco(tm) sauce on my desk.  Someone might come out of the woodwork and claim that I was planning to put that in the water supply.  Hehehehe... :(

@_subject: How much you lose under Social Security -- socialsecurity.org 
This is really a double tax since if you own assets, you've already paid
taxes on those said assets in the form of income tax.  If it's an
inheritance, that too was taxed, so what the fuck?  What's the
justification behind this other than exit rape?
I suppose one way is to take loads of trips and loads of AmEx traveler's
checks, then gamble on things with 50% chance of winning, take the
winnings and dump'em in accounts outside.  Repeat until nothing's left,
then exit with very little.
So let's sue the system.  Might fail, but maybe we can get it the fuck out
of our income taxes.  One less tax to bother with.  Since it no longer
does what it is supposed to, might as well get rid of it.  One way is to
calculate how much you've put in it, and what is expected you'll receive
on retirement.  Compare the two, then sue the bastards.   (I donno what
I've been smoking, but I should get more of it, that's for sure. heheheh)
Not worth wasting the disinfectant IMHO.  I'd say take the money, purchase
the favors of AIDS infect whores and throw congress and the senate a
really big party. :)  Oh, and make sure the condoms have holes.

I have been asked by Steve Crocker, CyberCash's Chief Technical Officer,
to post this message concerning security of CyberCash's software.
The following should appear in its entirety if it's printed at all.
Permission is granted to repost this message as long as the entire
message is reposted unaltered with the PGP signature intact.
The following message appeared on the net.
We have taken this quite seriously and have put through a full release
of our software which will be available Monday 11/24 for three
platforms and others shortly thereafter. The flaw was in the
debug logging function, not in the protocols or core
implementation.  Nonetheless, the effect was an unnecessary
exposure of potentially sensitive information, and it shouldn't
have gone out the door that way.  We're tightening our internal
processes to avoid this in the future.
That said, here's the actual exposure.  The credit card information
that's in the clear in the log comes from "merchant-initiated"
transactions, which means the merchant obtains the credit
card number from somewhere -- phone, mail, fax, SSL-protected
Internet interaction, or unprotected Internet interaction.
The merchant thus has the same info in the clear already.
If the card number was provided via a wallet, then the card
number is blinded at the consumer's end.  It is therefore
not in the clear as it passes through the merchant's machine
and the reported exposure does not apply..
In order for the unprotected log to pose a risk of exposure,
someone has to be able to gain access to the merchant's machine.
If the machine is well protected, viz behind a firewall and/or
carefully configured, presumably an outsider won't be able to
gain access.  And in terms of the *additional* exposure the
open log represents over existing risks, if the same information
is accessible in the clear elsewhere on the machine, eliminating
from the log or encrypting the log provides little or no real
protection.  We continue to advise merchants to take strong steps
to protect their machines.
To our knowledge, the exposure documented above has not resulted
in the actual loss of any customer data or other security incident.

Not so difficult.  Remember that Bell stink-bombed those offices

Play that part up, and the ludicrousness of everything else he was

the bad ass terrorist view of him.  We need to push the "he was a
misguided kid" or "this was all fantasy" bit.  Hell everyone whose ever
dealt with the IRS can sympathise with his desire to stink bomb them.
The big bad thing is that they haven't yet sentenced him.  If they do,
it'll be very bad for him, however, it will be that much worse for the
IRS (perhaps another reason for the delays, or it could be they need to
break him so he confesses terrorist plots first...) it can generate "IRS
throws Bevis like kid in Jail for Stink Bombing" headlines.  (Sure, he's
no kid, but make him look like one.)
Perhaps a timeline article of all of the IRS's abuses with this one as the
final point would add to the fuel...
How do we further force them into that position?

@_subject: Quoting Portions of a Signed Document 
Or use a MIME attachment to store secure hashes (heck, these could even be
CRC32's if you're not too paranoid which you could pack into 5 bytes of
ascii or something) of each of the lines in the body, then a valid
signature of all the hashes at the end. When you reply to such a message, you'll need to reattach the hash
attachment to the reply along with some sort of translation table that
says line 20 in this message is quoted from line 502 in the original.
You'll also need some way to do quotes that won't interfere with the hash
testing... maybe using block quotes such as
or delete the ">" chars.  But you'll get in trouble with auto text
i.e. reply signature mime attachment:
*Quoted Lines used: 15=234, 16=235, 17=236, etc...
*From Original Mime attachment:
*Begin body hashes
line1hash line2hash line3hash line4hash line5hash.... lineNhash
*Begin body hash signature
*End signature
Or when you quote the message, you could have the begin_quote blocks have
the line translation in them.
If you don't mind shoving HTML in the text, the begin quote blocks in the
body of the reply could include the line number.  i.e.
(using square brackets so those using HTML readers will see this.)
Problem with this scheme:
But, then what do we do about quoted quotes from the reply of the
reply????  We could recurse the stuff through, but then deep replies will
have a large number of attachments if we chose to retain them...  Possible
solution, don't keep quoted quote signatures, or just keep the message
id's of them so they can be verified from an archive server or
While you will need special mailer clients to decode the attachments and
verify the quotes, you still want some compatibility with regular mail

Ooh, ooh, something I was trained in once.
Tempest protection is the ability to prevent undesirable signals from
escaping a computer system.  In the old days, electro-mechanical teletypes were used by the military.
 Someone discovered that placing a signal analyzer on the power feed
shows what character is represented by each signal spike.  Automating
the translation gives you a mirror output of each message someplace
else.  Electrical filters (not just transformers which can pass these
signals) prevent this.  Present day keyboards and mice also radiate
signals, readable even though the device is within the FCC part 15 class
A or B device signal emanation restrictions.  Both tube-type and LCD
displays are big transmitters, and can be read by receivers connected to
similarly phased displays.  The receivers can be in a nearby building,
van, plane or satellite.  Makes you think twice when typing PGP messages
or 'accidentally' hitting a 'can be used against you' newsgroup.  Search
for 'Van Eck' for more data.  Physical metallic shielding (and thorough
testing) fixes this.  Network wires and equipment are also major radio
transmitters, metallic types are readable from a distance, and of course
networks can be directly tapped, even glass fiber.  (It's been found in
military environments, a simple wire was surreptitiously stretched above
a ceiling, and which would act as a retransmitter.)  All cables are
guilty of transmitting readable signals if not properly shielded and
filtered.  Van Eck/tempest exploiting devices are used in the
military/spy/wire-fraud/'drug war' business and in both government
sponsored and private corporate espionage.
Don't confuse EMP (Electro-Magnetic Pulse) protection with Tempest,
since EMP is a high-energy pulse (such as created by a nuclear burst)
that generates a high-voltage electrical pulse in both plugged in and
off-line electronic equipment, and typically frys all unshielded
electronics.  Same effect as a power surge, but affects all circuits,
even parts sitting on shelves.  HERF guns do the same thing.
Damn.  I'm also guilty of contributing to the noise and 'firewalls-list'
demise of NTsecurity list.

Shut up Kent, yes, we know it is you posting this rant.  The above fails
due to one single little key word "his personal key." If it is his

indeed is a corporate key you should have said so, and he - the employee

principals, if that wasn't done, the company is stupid and doesn't deserve

Correction: not only will they look incompetent, but in reality this

something every company should consider.  It's the same with filing taxes

Hi Matt,
first - the last 2-3 days I've been 'BEHIND' the list - had to read some 200
mails to get by.  ;-)()
So maybe someone else did anser just your first question.
Right, one of the new features of NT 5 is the EFS (Encryption File System)
including a feature called data-recovery.
The EFS is an additional layer above good-old NTFS to allow users to encrypt
single files, directories and whats below or whole drives. One reason
Microsoft added EFS was to nihilate tools like NTFSDOS --- reading an
NTFS-volume just by booting it on a DOS-disk in the NTbox. Another is
protection of -lost- notebooks and the like ...
As the whitepaper on the M$ site shows, the made up a pretty easy to handle
and ?? pretty secure ?? to deal with system. Using asymmetric cryptography -
i.e. private and public keys - they are up2date in technology and supporting
weak and strong encryption 40/56 bit DES they confirm with the US export
restrictions on cry. An migration path from 40 to 56 bit is mentioned too -
if restrictions will lower down. (Hope so !)
The second aspect of EFS ist the ?option? to data-recovery (not key recovery
or key escrow). There is one/more Security Agents -the Admin or delegated
persons- whose public key will be used in an additional encrypted-block to
give companies the possibility to restore the !! DATA !!! encrypted with the
public key of that Sec-Agent.
NOTE: The private key of the user will not be used or made public to anyone
at anytime !!  (Replace anyone by Company, Manager, Hacker, Government, FBI
or the like) By this it seems to be true data-recovery as should be. The
open question states itself - what backdoors did/had to M$ implement to cope
with US.
Kerberos v5 is something completely different ! It is build up to replace
the silly plaintext and the clever (but broken) challenge/response protocols
of older versions of NT. [Call for Hackers]
On the one hand you will loose lots of compatibility but gain lots of
security. It is strongly used in the authentication of the new directory
structure of NT 5 (another withepaper to read). Kerb v5 also points in the
direction of DCE / *NIX compatibility.
IMHO the effort of M$ is quite good but not nearly completed as there are
several needed features not implemented yet and announced for NT 5.x or 6.
And its a BETA if you have it !
As you can think I'm really hot to get the NT5 beta to test those new

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
I am replying to the "security problem" report in pgpverify written by

including BUGTRAQ and Best-Of-Security. Normally I'd simply ignore
this article, but this is so breath-takingly ridiculous that I have to
set a few facts straight.

This is plain bullshit. pgpverify is working just fine and there's no
security leak or malfunction in the script.
The real story behind this 'report' is as follows: Lutz is the
moderator for the german language de.* USENET hierarchy. One of his
duties is to send out regular checkgroups and other control messages.
What he did is that he didn't include the Message-Id and Date header
into the signature of the control messages that he posted. He only
signed headers like From and Subject. So he posted control messages
with incomplete signatures for maybe a year, until this was first
noticed and publicly addressed by Ralph Babel.
The problem with these control messages is that anybody is able to
re-post them with a new Message-Id and Date. Due to the correct PGP
signature, most INNs will simply execute them, thus deleting all
changes in the hierarchy since the checkgroups was posted originally.
While this is not a major problem, it certainly is a problem, as all
groups that have been created past a certain date can easily be
removed, etc...
When his mistake became public, he didn't stand up for it and created
a new key to start posting correct control messages, rendering the old
ones useless, he put the blame on Tale and his script instead.
So please don't believe this "security flaw". pgpverify is working
just fine and if the responsible person will use PGP correctly, there
is no problem at all.

There has been quite an interest in EMP. Very simply EMP is a broadband

projects. I have some of the wooden nuts and bolts from the antenna towers
and the wooden runways used to taxi aircraft for testing. He related EMP
pulses to a near miss lightning strike. As far as vehicle disabling, There
are claims that auto manufactures have built in a shut down frequency into
the computers in certain vehicles. We wound a large coil on a carpet paper
tube and put an oscillator on it and it would flood a vehicles electrical
system to shut it down, but it was huge. The easiest way to learn about
EMP is to find the International TESLA society web site and interpret the

Frankly among certain crowds many backdoors and other bugs have been

crypto on the back door, but even so, you now know their formats, and can
also disassemble the code.  When you do, you've got the hole and can
publish it. Once you publish the hole and break the program.  Who will have confidence
in that program after it's broken?
After the evil laws, our jobs will be to break ALL GAK'ed software.  How
will they prevent that?  Passing more laws to make the exposure of bugs

According to trade reports, the 21264 will be available at 800MHz by mid 98
but the die size (a .25 micron die) will need a signficant shrink to make
the speed practical (heat and power consumption will be monsterous).  It
will need a die shrink to a .15 or .18 process in order for 800MHz + Alpha
CPUs to be inexpensive enough to produce in volume. A smaller die size
increases the number of chips that are "good" per waffer and decreases the
finished chips power consumption and heat dissipation.  Other methods for
dealing with CPU speed (which don't address power or heat directly) include
using CMOS alternatives like BiCMOS and Gallium Arsenide.  Gallium Arsenide
is very expensive, and the element Gallium is a rare earth element, so high
production using it is not possible.  As for the existing Digital freon "lab" chips, the 1.2GHz frequency has
actually been surpassed twice already, with some reports saying that the
last test with a non-production (beta 21364?) chip reached 2.6GHz. I don't
know if at that frequency the processor was at sub-zero (in Celsius)
temperatures, but it was at least a liquid nitrogen machine.  One question
no one seems to ask is "how fast were the external buses to memory and
cache running on these testbeds?"    Xray lithography has already produced (in very limited quantity) operable
memory and processors with die sizes of below .000001 microns, a size that
could accomodate about 1000 21264 processors  in a package that would
appear to be little more than a single "chip."  The problem with implementing Xray lithography is that almost none of the
existing process tools for producing chips can be used.  The precise photo
lithography masks (most of which are used with ultra-violet light) don't
work anymore (Xray just goes right through) forcing you to use alloys of
lead, bismuth and zirconium in the masks, a considerably more expensive and
complex method.  Ionizer units and other tools would have to be built for
dealing with incredibly low tolerance.  When Xray lithography is finally implmented, there will be a quantum lead
in the frequency (multi GHz) while simulataneously reducing power
consumption and heat dissipation.  SMP and massively parallel machines will
be portable boxes that will weigh only slightly more than the case and
screen (if the TFT panel itself does not fall prey to light weight
projection glasses) force it to be.   The other option for new memory and processor devices is to "grow" them.
Nanotechnologies that may be available in the next 10 years could allow
microscopic machines in combination with biologic engineering could produce
processors and memory of sizes at or below those of Xray lithography, with
significant implications in other industries as well. One issue very rarely addressed in trade mags is the system bus speeds for
the system bus (or any seperate cache, memory and I/O buses).  Without a
fast external bus speed, the system cannot necessarily provide more usable
performance, particularly when memory becomes bottlenecked and saturated
even at todays low frequencies.  High internal CPU frequency does can not
provide a linear increase in performance in and of itself.  At about
400MHz, you have reached the maximum frequency an electrical bus can run.
The next option for connecting the system bus to the processors is through
optical buses.  Optical buses don't suffer from the interference and noise
that electrical buses do, and can operate at up to many thousands of GB
without the error rates.  Optical buses will connect all cache, memory and
storage devices (directly without I/O adaption) in multiple segments with
parallel access to all devices.  The problems with doing this are the speed
of the embedded switches which convert electrical signals into optical
pulses are currently much too high in latency.  A die shrink, the use of a
high speed silicon or GA switch (or some new Selenium technology) could
make the speed between electrical and optical buses practical.   The other implication of more advanced methods for producing memory and
processors is that the sluggish mechanical disk drive becomes totally
obsolete.  Massive non-volatile memory storage could be added to a system
directly off the memory bus without the need for additional I/O buses.
Hologramic optical storage devices (which store data as an image in 3D
space) will replace most of the mechanical drive based multi-terrabyte
installations with multi exabyte storage that will be 1000 smaller than
existing storage devices. The entire world could place all its currently
existing data and archives into a hologramic memory device the size of a
lunch box.  If it all sounds far fetched, its been proven possible already.
Lets give it 10 years.   Kirk R. Erichsen

@_subject: Why GAK is uncool - preaching to the choire 
Reasons why it sucks:
* It assumes that everyone is guilty until proven innocent.  The only way
to prove you're innocent is of course to have them look at your
* It is the  cyber equivalent of installing cameras, microphones, and other surveilance gear in every room of your house (for a desktop machine)
and in your car (for your notebook/pda).
* When people buy crypto enabled software they do so because they have a
need for privacy.  GAK puts a back door into their need for privacy which
makes them not trust the software since Big Uncle can violate that privacy
at whim.
* People will not trust American produced crypto, American software
companies will go out of business.
* People who need truly secure communications will have to decide between
privacy or being law-abiding.  Not only does GAK assume everyone is guilty
before it being proven, but it will FORCE some to break the law.  It
criminalizes a right that's as basic as breathing.
* It will not stop any crimes, criminals will simply use strong crypto
developed on their own, or older non-GAKk'ed products.  Those criminals
will not be caught through crypto, they will be caught through their
actions in the real world - i.e. shipments of cocaine stopped at the
border by rug sniffing dogs, etc.
* Even if the criminals or terrorists don't use unGAKed software, they
will simply develop code phrases that look like "Hi Mom, everything is
fine at Camp 5, the food smells bad" to mean "send 5 tons of cocaine" and
"Hi Dad, life is good at school, can you send me a pair of socks" to mean
"send two tons of pot" or some such.
* It installs a Law Enforcement Agent in every crypto software.  That
Agent is dormant until the LEA's decide to wake it, but it is the
equivalent of quarterring LEA's in every crypto software, remote
controlled or not, that's what GAK is.
* If the DOD can't be trusted to be honorable when it comes to paying for
software (see blurb in CommWeek - or was it ComputerWorld where the SPA
reports that over 50% of all software intalled on DoD computers is in
copyright violation!) how can the LEA's be trusted to get honest warrants
for listening in?  * And let's not forget the honorable DoJ and the Inslaw affair.
* Well we, all know that the LEA's can easily obtain warrants by simply
saying any combination of the following "suspected of:  illegal drug
trafficking, child porn,amassing weapons, or terrorist leanings." More
likely, they'll simply listen in to all traffic the way the NSA listens in
to all telegrams.  If their charter doesn't allow it, they'll co-operate
with the Brits and have them pass the info back to make it "legal."  The
Feds will simply listen to all traffic, if they see something interesting,
then they'll get a warrant and listen for more. * The TLA's have to realize that the cold war is OVER, and that the
American people against whom they wish to spy is their employer.  Our Tax
money pays these people to spy on us.  We're their boss, it's time to give
them new orders by voting against GAK. (Not that at this point voting
means shit.)

@_subject: y2k as ideological opportunity 
I once worked for the city version of the evil corrupt state mechanism
here in NYC.  It's not as bad as people think it is, it's actually FAR
Here's my experiences:
The sysadmin there had quit unexpectedly and took a severance package.
Because the dude took severance, this closed the "line" for the job, which
means there was no longer a sysadmin postition available.  So they were
forced to hire me as a "special consultant" for supposedly two weeks -
took them two months to recreate the position.
When they were going to create an ID (no big deal, just a kodak like
camera with a laminator and some pre-printed text - for which they use
typewriters, yes typewriters to create) I had to wait a few days to get
one.  To quote the Human Resources weasel as to a reason "Because the temp
who makes them won't be here until Wednesday" (this was a full time, full
fledged gooberment employee.  The temp was expectedly a high school kid.)
After about another two months, I had to go through a "background check."
I had to pay for said background check.  All this being mandatory, failure
to do so results in instant firing and never being able to work there
again, etc.  I had to pay for this with a POSTAL money order. No check, no
bank money order - because those expire in 90 days and these buttfucked
people take longer than that to cash them in.  So not only do you get to
bend over for the city to peek into your ass, you have to pay for it too,
in a weird way.
All the forms are paper, xeroxed and re-xeroxed and re-xeroxed from
ancient type written forms, and they're mostly illegible.  One of the
forms was for politicians that clearly states that working for the city
means you're a public figgure and that you can expect NO PRIVACY and that
they may snoop on you in any way shape or form including health and credit
records, etc.
The beurocracy was legendary.  They were running on 286's with DOS and
Windoze 3.1 with 2 megs of ram and 20 to 80Mb hard drives...  This was in
the time of Windows 95 and pentium machines...  Viruses everywhere.
The network was the shittiest thing I ever saw running all 300 machines of
that department on 10b2! Yes! Coax, with Coax hubs.  50% of the time spent
was tracking down a loose connection that some ditz seccy had kicked out
(no offense to secretaries, but these folks were as smart as bricks.)

various departments ordering say, 386's or 486's and having those rerouted

CDROMS, sound cards, and other standard stuff ordered there was re-routed

was prevalent, even for server software.

(By the way, did you know there is such a thing as a sewer tax that
businesses pay for, and that bakeries can get a discount on, because
baking makes most of the water they use evaporate and not go down the
sewer?  Such was the trivia there...)

That all depends on how they are set up to accept such key requests.  Fer
instance, say they set up a nice litte web site that takes in credit

Suppose they set up a mail in system where you have to mail letters to

requests to that address.  As most mags will happily send a free issue
this will do wonders...  Send them to "Joe Smith, Care Of Key Escrow..."

If they set up a system whereby mistakes have to be refiled, then we
simply all march down there and demand that we get our keys registered and
we always make mistakes in something or other, or we forget our ID's.

is about to take (well meaning but ill-informed?) policy decisions
that would result in the curtailment of our rights to export OpenBSD
as we know it.
Apologies for the short notice but it appears that the
Canadian government may be trying to put a fast one over
by having a sham "public comment" period before going
ahead with their own agenda. Possibly not. In any case,
the DEADLINE FOR COMMENTS IS APRIL 21, so please act on

I'm uncertain as to their intentions.  They do have what seems to be
interesting information as to how Law Enforcement works, but after
subscribing to their "F9" mailing list out of curiosity, it seems that
every other email is a call to join them in their "battle" against
whatever vague enemy they believe they have and to set up "cells."
I don't know if the value of their material and the validity as such,
perhaps a local LEO on this list can verify its accuracy, however,
IMHO, it's best to not get involved with them as they're either very
honest about their intent and thus are in great danger and are a
great danger to others, or are a front for something evil.
What's interesting is that I've not received any more of the F9
messages in a long while, so something is up with them, either that
or because I've shown no interest in joining their "cause"  they've
stopped sending mail.
They're certainly a lot more than just a site put up by freedom loving folks, and the web site doesn't display that.

One of the things to consider in order to be successful in this at any level is
that we need to automate some of the features of including such keywords in

remove the chaff emails.  (Think of the way spam gets filtered based on
Certainly if we use the same tag in every email, they can filter us out by the
email address.  This does have a nice unexpected side effect: being labeled a
kook makes for the NSA not wanting to watch your posts, and then you would have
a bit more privacy, however, don't count on this: far more likely is that they
do archive everything and then use a smart search engine.
We could rotate the tags around, but if we send too many of these, they can
throw you into the above category.
You could post them anonymously, which makes it much harder for them catalog,
so they will be forced to look at the traffic, when and if, they need to search
You could have some program randomly alter your email address, but patterns
would be found to filter you out that way.
We could also use remailers to create lots of cover traffic going to

current event keywords.  Then again, they could filter the messages that go to
We are of course talking about doing something as evil as spamming in that it
does generate lots of traffic and eats up lots of bandwidth.  This has the side
effect of wasting lots of our resources and little of the NSA's.  There is the
obvious problem of how many people are willing to do such a thing.  If say, ten
or twenty of us start running such spookbots, it will eat lots of our
resources, but few of theirs.  If lots and lots of us run spookbots, it might
create a small dent in Echelon which they'll simply address by adding more
hardware.  (Keep in mind that the figure of their yearly budget is several
billion, for which you pay for in the form of taxes.  Comparatively to one

Unless there is a large scale effort, we'd be doing nothing more than the
WASSENAAR protest.  Sure, some would say, we'd be calling undue attention to
ourselves, but if you're on this list, or receiving it, you're already calling
undue attention to yourself.  If Echelon is indeed as large as it is reported
to be, the mere reading of Cypherpunks is enough to flag you.

@_subject: Changing to Moderated Cypherpunks -- How? 
Hi there, as requested, here's some info about the filtered cypherpunks
list which I run (by hand with the help of a couple of mailbots)
This list is NOW running from: sunder at sundernet.com
GZIPped versions of the digests are available from:
        Basically, I use the 'bots to keep the list of recipients, then forward
any message to this list of usernames which I find interesting, and
usually noise-free... Since, I do this by hand, AND since there is no majordomo mailing list
software, and since I get a lot of mail, it's a good idea to make sure the
subject of any messages you send to me stand out.  i.e. make the subject
line:     "***000 Personal junk mail for the human, not the bots ***"
(The 0's are there to make sure that when Pine sorts the messages on this side, they come up on top, making sure I'll see them immediatly.)
There is no automated filtering of any sort...   Whatever message I find to be interesting, news-worthy, or technical (theoretical crypto, actual code, etc) gets handed over to the bots, which send it to this list.
If you use some sort of filtering program to move messages to a folder, look for the string "FCPUNX:" (without quotes) in the subject field.
There will usually be a propagation delay of one day to a week days -
sometimes as long as two weeks between the messages on the actual
cypherpunks list, and this filtered one.  This is because I may not always
get the chance to log in every day, and also because I may have to wade
through tons of noise/spam/flames from the real list. :-)
Occasionally, if I see something interesting from another list (such as
Cyber Rights, coderpunks, etc) I will forward it here if I feel that it
pertains to Cypherpunk interests, or that you'd like to see it. You should unsubscribe yourself from the real list by sending an
"unsubscribe cypherpunks" message to majordomo at toad.com - that is send a
message with no subject and just that single line - no signature either,
so as to unsubscribe.  - Unless you wish to continue to receive messages
from the real list as well as copies of those messages from here. :-)
All filtering is again according to my whims so if you dislike what I send you, sorry.  I might eventually work something out where this list will be broken up into many tiny lists so you'd subscribe to whatever subjects you're interested in.
This is a free service, no strings attached, just tons o'mail, but less mail than the unfiltered list...
Also note that the bots I run may sometimes be slightly buggy and may do unexpected weird things.  Appologies in advance if this happens.  But please by all means do report any such runaway bot occurances.
If you wish to unsubscribe yourself from this list, just send a message with the subject "unsubscribe fcpunx" (no quotes) and the next time I log in, one of the bots will handle the ubsubscribe.
You can re-subscribe yourself as many times as you like, you'll only get
one copy of each message, but as many copies of the request response as
you've sent.The 'bots hone in on your address and send mail only there, so
subscribe yourself from whatever account you want to receive mail. If by accident you subscribe from two different machines, the bots won't know the difference and you'll get two copies of each filtered message, so be careful.
This also means that you can only unsubscribe yourself from the same
address you subscribed from.
To get help, send a message with the subject "help fcpunx."
To subscribe yourself (if you see this, you are subscribed) send a message with the *SUBJECT* "subscribe fcpunx"
NOTE: THE BOTS ONLY RESPOND TO THE SUBJECT LINE, NOT TO TEXT IN THE BODY OF YOUR MESSAGE!
The bots only look at your message's subject and your mailing address so it doesn't matter what you put in the body.
Whenever the 'bots honor a request from you, you'll see a response mailed from them (under my name.)
Since the bots are only active when I log in and run them by hand, the message acknowledging your request may take several days to get to you.
*ALL COMMANDS MUST BE SENT IN THE SUBJECT OF THE MESSAGE!  The body (text) of the message are ignored.
Commands available:
 subscribe fcpunx           - subscribes you to the list and you are                               visible to fcpunx who requests
 subscribe invisible fcpunx - subscribe but don't let others know
 digest fcpunx              - receive the digest version (visibly)
 digest invisible fcpunx    - receive the digest invisibly
 unsubscribe fcpunx         - unsubscribe from the list or digest
 undigest fcpunx
 who fcpunx                 - receive a list of (visible) subscribed users
                                * THIS IS DISABLED CURRENTLY FOR PRIVACY
                                  PROTECTIONS OF THE SUBSCRIBERS ON THIS LIST *
 help fcpunx                - sends a help file (you're looking at it)
If you're already subscribed to the list and want to switch to the digest version, you can do this by sending a digest fcpunx message; the reverse is also true.  Notice that you cannot subscribe to both the digest and the list.  Sorry.  If you'd like that feature either use two different accounts to receive them, or complain to me and I'll add it in.
The unsubscribe and undigest commands do the same thing, they take you off the list no matter which version you're subscribed to.

It eats up your valuable time.  You might not see it for what it is, but
it is an interruption of normal service.  It's annoying as having your
pager go off durring sex and having to call back your boss instead of
ignoring it.  (Presume you can't shut off your pager.)  It takes away
from the continuity of life.
Further, some of us use ISDN to get their email and transferring the
extra junk adds to the pay/minute connections.
There are nice technical solutions to this.  If sendmail didn't transport
things unauthenticated it could be done, but at a cost in CPU cycles on mail
Have every sendmail server use a PK scheme to talk to every other
server and authenticate the connection.  Have every sendmail server accept
mail only from those whose key is verified.
Anonymous remailers would still work and these could be set up to accept
unauthenticated email, but then use their own credentials to send out
the mail, so it will auth with your servers.  Also have the anon remailers
not accept too many messages from one source within a certain time frame to
different destinations.  i.e. if I send out 50 messages to cypherpunks in
one hour, that's cool.  If I send out 50 messages to 50 different users
everywhere within an hour, it's not cool.
This way the spamming bitches would be forced to still register domain
names and send mail from them, and you can have your mail server block
them as needed and be certain of where they came from.  If you have
problems with anon users, you can block unsigned (and/or signed but
unrecognized) messages from anon users, while still allowing signed
messages of anons you know well and accept mail from.  [Note: I said known anons, this prevents Spamfuckers from genning
10 billion key pairs to spam you with.]
(I won't get into persistant anonymous identities and reputation capital
as that's been beaten to death already.)
IMHO with such a scheme it will be possible to reactivate email relaying
again, it just requires everyone to gen their own DH or RSA keys.  The
mailer software can handle this for users, so it's of little issue.
The other side of the coin is that ISP's should include AUP clauses that
state if you spam, you pay extra $$$ and make it enforceable via contract.
Say, you pay shit.net $10/month for access, you'll have to sign a thing
that says if you use your account to spam, you'll have to pay $500,000
or something just as prohibitive, or release their real world info, (or whatever can be legally used to deter the fuckers.)
If any ISP's don't do this, or allow way too many spams, they get
filtered from your servers.
Mind you, this won't totally stop spammers, but it will make it hard for them.  Food for thought.  IMHO, with such fascist anti-encryption
laws today, this is unlikely to take off. :(
OTOH, the idea of pledging not to buy anything from spammers helps in
the long run, but there are enough sheep out there that will accept
any crap thrown in their mail.  Further, spamming them back helps.
If they put 800 numbers on the spam, call them and talk to them for
hours and waste their time.  If they put fax numbers in there, send
them orders with fake addresses.  If they put up net addresses, block
them from your router and/or flood them with extra traffic if you can
or want to.  If they put up PO addresses, subscribe them to many weird
magazines by sending in the fall out cards with their address on
it.  (seek legal advice before trying these, I'm just ranting and venting.)

I didn't. Anonymous did.  Until someone else gets a throw away $10 account and uses it to spam, right?  By the time you track'em down, they already gave up
that account.  All ISP's do is to delete the spamming account, which
the spammer doesn't care about anyway.  So you achive nothing.
Further one can generate fake headers and you would not know exactly where
it comes from, though you could have some idea since it would be one of
many sites it was relayed from.  One could send messages from an ISP
that doesn't mind spammers who won't help you track down the bitch that

Bullshit.  PK auth with a central repository would be Big Brotherish.
Having each user gen their own PK pair is what I suggested. That
would allow anon users to have persistant (or even throw away)
identities, but prevent Joe Spambitch from telnetting to port 25
and spamming that way.
Even if Joe Spambitch does gen PK pairs and uses them, he can't
gen a pair for every message he sends, the recipient servers won't
recognize his PK pair and might have been instructed to block messages
from bad (and possibly unknown PK's), or at least refuse to relay
messages from unknown PK's.  Relaying is a big problem.

Show me one place in the email you replied to where I mention that I would
any sort of governmental action in terms of passing anti-spam laws.  I did
contracts between ISP's and subscribers at one point, but did you see anything
about someone passing laws?
If I am forced to pay for something that I don't want to buy, it is a theft
of my money.  If you send me garbage without my asking for it, then you're
wasting my money.  If I subscribe to a mailing list and don't want to see
your messages, it's a different story since I have to take other steps to
not see what you post.  In other words, in one case you are targetting me
with spam, in the other, I want to receive cypherpunks minus one user, but
that user isn't directly targetting me.
Ditto as the response above.  I will accept any non commercial, non moral
pushing message.  i.e. there are those who like my home page and email me
to tell me so.  There are those who hate it and tell me so.  There are
those who ask for help, or offer help.  No problemo there.
But there are those who see the upside down pentagram and send me email
stating I'm in the wrong religion.  Thems I consider spam because they
try to pursuade me to their belief system.
Makes no difference what you throw in.  A mail exploder that auto subscribes
everyone on the planet without their consent IS a source of spam.  A mail
exploder that sends email to those who wish to receive it is not because there
was consent.
Spam is unsolicited broadcasts.   Pure and simple.  If you spam me with
a scheme to make you money, it's spam.  If you spam me with "Jesus loves you"
it's a spam.  If you spam me with chain letters promising whatever or warning
of great virus plages, it's still spam.  Content is a valid criterion for spam
and so is consent. It's the unwanted content of these messages that makes
them unwanted.  If they were useful to the recipient, they wouldn't be unwanted
hence would not be spam.
Problem is every dickhead who buys into the "Make Money Fast on the Net
By Spamming" theory has dollar signs in his eyes and thinks his message
is the most valuable, most useful, most cuddly lovely bit of info on the
planet and that he's doing everyone a service by shoving it down their unwiling throats.
I posted a very nice technological way to deter spam, and you go and read
governmental interfearence in it.  READ the message you reply to before you
respond to it.
No shit.  And that's what I posted earlier.

1)From: "George Martin" NEWS FROM THE LIBERTARIAN PARTY
2600 Virginia Avenue, NW, Suite 100
Washington DC 20037
Do you have any privacy left when Big Brother can spy on
you from space -- or through your walls?
WASHINGTON, DC -- Spy satellites. Gamma ray scanners. Thermal-imaging devices.
It's not science fiction -- it's a list of the exotic, high-tech surveillance equipment the government now uses to monitor, track, and arrest American citizens, the Libertarian Party pointed out
"Yesterday's science fiction has become today's political reality,"
said Steve Dasbach, the party's national chairman. "High-tech military
equipment that was once used against foreign armies is now
being used against American citizens on a routine basis."
As a result, the Fourth Amendment's protection against "unreasonable search" is under technological siege, he warned -- and government agencies are rushing to take advantage of this new power.
"Most people don't realize it, but law enforcement agencies are now
spying on us through the walls of our houses, taking high-resolution
photographs of us from space, and conducting drug tests based on trace
elements of chemicals in the air," said Dasbach.
Paranoid fantasy? Not at all: Such high-tech surveillance equipment
is becoming an increasingly common tool for law enforcement, according to reports in USA Today and the Wall Street Journal.
Here's a sampling of how state and federal agencies are using this
terrifying technology to spy on Americans:
* In North Carolina, county governments use high-resolution spy satellite
photographs to search for property improvements that might increase
property tax assessments.
* On the Mexican border, police use a "gamma ray scanner" to check
tanker trucks for contraband, scanning right through the vehicle's metal
* The Naval Surface Warfare Center has developed an "ion sniffer,"
a metal box that analyzes the chemical makeup of the air -- and can detect,
for example, traces of cocaine through the skin days after drug use.
* In Georgia, the state's Department of Revenue will start using
NASA satellites to examine the state's 58,910 square miles for illegal
timber cutting.
* In New Jersey, California, and other states, police use thermal
imaging devices to scan houses for unusual heat sources that could indicate
indoor marijuana growing operations. Houses can be scanned while police sit
in their cruisers on the street.
* And in Arizona, the state's Department of Water Resources uses
spy satellite photographs to monitor 750,000 acres of state farmland, and
compares the images to a database to discover which farmers don't have
irrigation permits.
Even worse: The federal government will spend another $4.5 million
this year to develop even more intrusive surveillance equipment.
Currently under development by the Justice Department: A "super
x-ray" -- combining traditional x-ray technology, ultra-sound imaging, and computer-aided metal detectors -- to reveal items hidden under clothes from up to 60 feet away.
The courts are currently wrestling with the implications of the new
technology, debating the limits of the government's power to "search"
individuals from a distance with high-tech gadgets. Several contradictory
court decisions have already emerged, for example, about whether
thermal-imaging searches are Constitutional.
Meanwhile, Republican and Democratic politicians continue to look
for new uses of the technology -- with some government officials already
talking about using satellite surveillance to track items as small as
backyard porches to check for zoning violations and construction permits.
"In the name of fighting crime, politicians seem eager to obliterate the
protections against unreasonable search, with equipment that Americans used
to only read about in Tom Clancy technothrillers," said Dasbach. "It's time
for the American public to wake up and realize that Big Brother is here
today -- and he's got a gamma ray scanner in his hand."

4)From: mkw-detective at t-online.de (MK-Wirtschaftsdienst GmbH)
The german online-magaine "Com!" (author: ulrike.duhm at t-online.de)
brought an article about the report of the european parliament.
Here a summary:
The european parliament reported, that the american secret service NSA
is monitoring emails, phonecalls and faxes. The informations are
forwarded from London and Menwith Hill via satellite to Fort Meade in
Maryland. Menwith Hill in Yorkshire, England, is the biggest spy post of
the world, that for the NSA collects political, economical, military and
private informations from europe and the former Sowjetunion.
The 48 year old Glyn Ford, member of the Labour-Party is behind this
report. Author of the 100 page document is Steve Wright of the
Manchester Omega foundation. The complete report can be found under:
For the first time, the european parliament confirmed the existence of
the spy network Echelon, the american part of the spysystem UKUSA.
1948, the USA, England, Canada, Australia and New Zeeland signed a
secret contract, the so called "United Kingdom - United States
Agreement" (UKUSA). Goal of it is the collective espionage. Via an
international ring of agents, the partners are exchanging informations.
The german hackers "Chaos Computer Club" ( thinks, that the
european eMail-user is trapped in a net of foreign forces. They are
concerned, that the newest versions of the encryption software PGP are
in part not compatible with older versions. The result: The exchange
between different versions is not possible. For the computer club, that
is no coincidence: the hackers from Hamburg, Germany,  believe, that a
contract between USA and Germany exists, that Germany is not allowed to
use a software, that the NSA cannot look in."

Gives you a way of tracing the spammer and avoiding forged headers.
Hey, ISP's do suffer damage from spammers.   If they let too many spammers on,
they'll get black listed and none of their users will be able to send mail to
some sites that chose to drop all mail from spam supporting ISP's.  This way
it's an incentive for them to drop spammers.
There being a contract between the ISP and the throw away account requiring
the payment of damages caused, it would provide teeth to prevent spamming.  If
spamming occurs, the spammer gets to pay for their advertising.  Right now,
spamming is relatively free for the advertiser.
No, there is no need for a central server.  It's more than enough to require
the user to gen keys of a certain minimal length.  This takes CPU time to do
and enough so to prevent spamming.  If they use the same keys, the servers
will recognize and count the total, thus limiting them to a fixed number of

Sounds good to me, except that it's a huge pain for the senders to send

As does my scheme.
Pushing crypto over legislation is worthwhile in any case, and pushes
towards anonymous reputation capital systems.
With a count of users.  If Dick Spammer is spamming someone he doesn't
much give a shit about 5 minute delays.  It only prevents massive massive
spams.  As long as the sysadmins don't notice you can send a fuckload of

(From the SpyKing Security Mailing list)
2)From: Mike G This was taken from the Computer Privacy Digest 1/4/98 V12
Very interesting.
The Swedes discover Lotus Notes has key escrow! (Win Treese)
The article describes the reaction when various people in the Swedish
government learned that the Lotus Notes system they were using includes
key escrow.   They were apparently unaware of this until Notes was in
use by thousands of people in government and industry.
Besides being an interesting reaction to key escrow systems, this
incident reminds us that one should understand the real security of a
  Secret Swedish E-Mail Can Be Read by the U.S.A.    Fredrik Laurin, Calle Froste, *Svenska Dagbladet*, 18 Nov 1997
One of the world's most widely used e-mail programs, the American Lotus
Notes, is not so secure as most of its 400,000 to 500,000 Swedish users
believe.  To be sure, it includes advanced cryptography in its e-mail
function, but the codes that protect the encryption have been
surrendered to American authorities.  With them, the U.S. government
can decode encrypted information.  Among Swedish users are 349
parliament members, 15,000 tax agency employees, as well as employees
in large businesses and the defense department.  ``I didn't know that
our Notes keys were deposited (with the U.S.).  It was interesting to
learn this,'' says Data Security Chief Jan Karlsson at the [Swedish]
our Notes keys were deposited (with the U.S.).  It was interesting to
learn this,'' says Data Security Chief Jan Karlsson at the [Swedish]
defense department.  Gunnar Grenfors, Parliament director and daily
e-mail user, says, ``I didn't know about this--here we handle sensitive
information concerning Sweden's interests, and we should not leave the
keys to this information to the U.S. government or anyone else.  This
must be a basic requirement.''
Sending information over the Internet is like sending a postcard--it's
that simple to read these communications.  When e-mail is encrypted, it
becomes unintelligible for anyone who captures it during transport.
Only those who have the right codes or raw computer power to break the
encryption can read it.  For crime prevention and national security
reasons, the United States has tough regulations concerning the level
of crytography that may be exported.  Both large companies and
intelligence agencies can already--in a fractions of a second--break
the simpler cryptographic protections.  For the world-leading American
computer industry, cryptographic export controls are therefore an ever
greater obstacle.  This slows down utilization of the Internet by
businesses because companies outside the U.S.A. do not dare to send
important information over the Internet.  On the other hand, the
encryption that may be used freely within the U.S.A. is substantially
more secure.
Lotus, a subsidiary of the American computer giant IBM, has negotiated
a special solution to the problem.  Lotus gets to export strong
cryptography with the requirement that vital parts of the secret keys
are deposited with the U.S. government.  ``The difference between the
American Notes version and the export version lies in degrees of
encryption.  We deliver 64 bit keys to all customers, but 24 bits of
those in the version that we deliver outside of the United States are
deposited with the American government.  That's how it works today,''
says Eileen Rudden, vice president at Lotus.
Those 24 bits are critical for security in the system.  40-bit
encryption is broken by a fast computer in several seconds, while 64
bits is much more time-consuming to break if one does not have the 24
bits [table omitted].  Lotus cannot answer as to which authorities have
received the keys and what rules apply for giving them out.  The
company has confidence that the American authorities responsible for
this have full control over the keys and can ensure that they will not
be misused.
On the other hand, this (assurance) does not matter to Swedish
companies.  On the contrary, there is a growing understanding that it
would be an unacceptable security risk to place the corporation's own
``master key'' in the hands of foreign authorities.  Secret information
can leak or be spread through, for example, court decisions in other
countries.  These concerns are demonstrated clearly in a survey by the
SAF Trade and Industry security delegation.  Some 60 companies answered
the survey.  They absolutely do not want keys deposited in the U.S.A.
It is business secrets they are protecting.  These corporations fear
that anyone can get a hold of this information, states Claes Blomqvist
at SAF.
Swedish businesses are also afraid of leaks within the American
authorities.  The security chief at SKF, Lars Lungren, states: ``If one
has a lawful purpose for having control over encryption, it isn't a
problem.  But the precept is flawed: They ought to monitor
(internally), but the Americans now act as if there are no crooks
working within their authorities.''
In some countries, intelligence agencies clearly have taken a position
on their country's trade and industry.  Such is the case in France.
One example, which French authorities chose to publicize, was in 1995
when five CIA agents were deported after having spied on a French
telecommunications company.

BONNERS FERRY, Idaho (Reuters) - An FBI sharpshooter has been ordered to
stand trial on charges of involuntary manslaughter over the 1992 standoff
at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, in which three people died, prosecutors said
Wednesday. Idaho Magistrate Quentin Harden ruled there was enough evidence to allow
the sharpshooter, Lon Horiuchi, to face trial on charges he acted with
negligence when he fired a shot that killed the wife of white separatist
Randy Weaver at his cabin. The standoff near Weaver's cabin turned into a rallying cry for extreme
right-wingers who condemned what they saw as federal government excesses
and held up Weaver as a hero. Boundary County prosecutor Denise Woodbury last August charged Horiuchi
and Weaver's friend Kevin Harris with the deaths of two people killed in
the standoff. The charges against Harris were later dismissed on the
grounds that he had already been acquitted of those charges in federal
court. In filing charges against Horiuchi, Woodbury accused the sharpshooter of
using a gun in a reckless manner by firing through the front door of
Weaver's house without first determining whether anyone other than his
intended target was behind the door. Horiuchi could face up to 10 years in
prison if convicted.
The standoff began Aug. 21, 1992, when U.S. Marshals approached Weaver's
cabin to arrest him for failing to appear in court on gun charges. U.S. Marshal William Degan and Weaver's 14-year-old son Sammy were killed in a
gun battle near the cabin, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation was
called in later that day.
The next day, Horiuchi wounded Weaver and Harris and killed Vicki Weaver. Weaver and Harris surrendered 10 days later and were acquitted of murder
charges in the killing of Degan in a 1993 federal trial.
Weaver said in a telephone interview from his home in Montana that he was
pleased by Harden's ruling. ``It's taken a long time, but sometimes the wheels of justice grind
slowly. We are looking to see some justice in all of this,'' Weaver said. ``To be honest I hope that he (Horiuchi)  eventually sees that he is just
one of two scapegoats and that eventually he will tell the whole truth.''
Horiuchi's lawyers were due to appear next Monday before a federal judge
in Boise to ask that the case against the FBI sniper be moved to federal
court. Horiuchi was scheduled to be arraigned Friday, Feb. 13, in Idaho district
court in Boundary County, but that could change if his case is remanded to
federal court. Neither Horiuchi's lawyers nor Woodbury were immediately available for
comment on Harden's ruling. 16)From: SpyKing at thecodex.com

Germany to restore bugging banned since Nazi-era
BONN, Jan 8 (Reuters) - German political leaders agreed on Thursday to
allow police to bug apartments of suspected criminals, restoring a
crime-fighting tool banned since abuses by the secret police in the Nazi
Leaders from Chancellor Helmut Kohl's centre-right coalition and the
opposition Social Democrats (SPD) said they had reached a deal allowing
police to plant microphones in private homes of suspected criminals for
the first time since 1945. Both houses of parliament are now expected to quickly pass the
long-debated measure, which police have argued was needed to better fight
organised crime and bring the country in line with other nations that
allow electronic surveillance. Germany, which reacted to the Gestapo's abuses with some of the Western
world's most extensive civil liberties laws, has long resisted any
relaxation in constitutional protections that have kept police out of
private homes.
Interior Minister Manfred Kanther said the agreement would give police the
necessary tool to fight organised crime.
"This is a decisive step towards more effectively fighting crime," Kanther
said. "We can now keep surveillance on suspected gangster apartments and
we will be able to better fight money laundering." The opposition SPD, which controls the upper house of parliament, the
Bundesrat, said it would support the measure after the government agreed
to partial exemptions for some professional groups such as priests,
attorneys and journalists. Police will be required to obtain advance court permission for any

concrete evidence that a serious crime was about to take place. Now authorities will have the power to use eavesdropping methods far more
extensively and will also for the first time be able to bug apartments
after a crime has been committed to obtain evidence.
Germany's post-war constitution barred police from electronic
surveillance, telephone taps and intercepting mail. The bans on telephone
taps and mail intercepts were relaxed in the 1970s amid a wave of
left-wing guerrilla attacks.

Total Bullshit.  I've seen Perry more than thrice, once at a speech
he gave for the Libertarian Party where Duncan also was, and also
at PC Expo a few years ago, and at a few NYC Cpunx meets.  Perry does exist.
Nobody gives a rats ass who the TLA spook 'bot, tentacle, or other
happens to be.  We all know and expect that this list is monitored
heavily by many TLA's including the NSA, FBI, and IRS.  There were
several IRS subscribtions to my filtered list a while back.  I guess
they couldn't deal with all the flaming and decided to get info on
the tax evaders without the flames...  I suppose either the NSA and
FBI know enough to have bought AOL or netcom accounts, or read the
list unfiletered.
IMHO, this is a well known fact, and I welcome them on this list.
Let'em sniff all they want, there's very little here that goes on
that isn't considered public knowledge anyway.  Heck, who knows after
reading much of Tim's posts, maybe their points of view will be
swayed and maybe they'll figgure it out for themselves.  Whatever.
IMHO, I've never met Vulis, so I can't say for sure.  It would interesting
if Tim/Dimitry were the same, but I doubt it.  For that to happen, Tim
would need to know a lot about NYC and be here a lot.  Although it would
be possible for Tim (as you propose) to do "Dimitry", from my experiences
of Dimitry, that's highly unlikely.  Dimitry did quite a bit of social
engineering of Earthweb to get info on me.  He also tried several attempts at calling me at home and getting info.  There was also an
NYC meeting where someone very suspicious (i.e. almost demented) showed up on his behalf, and mentioned lots of stuff about Xenix and
massacres....  So IMHO, "Vulis" had to be in NYC.  A while back a few folks said they
met him in person.  I'll let them comment on his description.
I will also add that I heavily complained to dm.com's upstream provider
and didn't get too far. It's possible that by the time Guy had complined,
that there were so many complaints against Vulis that psynet decided
to yank the coor.  Or, could be that Guy=Vulis. :)  Whatever.  Either
way I don't give a rats ass.
I've never met Tim, but have spoken with him since the early days of
the Cypherpunks list, back when Vulis didn't exist.  While I'm not
saying that Tim isn't a 'nym, I am saying that he's got far more
reputation capital than Vulis, or Guy.  Based on this, I do not believe
that Tim=Vulis.  Again, that's my belief, and have no evidence for or

@_subject: When write high-speed implementation, 
It's actually expressed as a set of complex numbers with lots of data in the
imaginary side.  These are displayed with fixed point decimals (or static
point decimals) expressing a width and height for the rectangle hence the term
S-Box.  Since DES works on 64 bit blocks using a 56 bit key, you can use either
56 decimal places, or 64 for more accuracy, but far less speed.
For purposes of optimization to extreme high speed, you should take your key
and sort it (be sure to use Quick Sort here, and not bubble sort!), that is put
all the 1 bits to the right, all the 0 bits to the left, and the naughty bits
in your head.  Then take the result and express it as 2^X-1, and extract X. Once you have X, repeat the process until X=2.
With me so far?  Good, now you have to extract the naughty bits from your mind,
and let N express them.  Your S boxes are now comprised of X+Ni which you can
simply express as 2+Ni.  Now, if you recall, Ni is the symbol for nickel, which
is what this algorithm is worth $2.05 payable in Monopoly dollars.  If you've
been following the news, you'll know that Microsoft is a monopoly and therefore
weighs the same as a duck.  Since ducks float, and wood also floats, ducks must
weigh the same as wood, and therefore are witches.  Multiply this by the flight
speed of an unladen African swallow, and divide it by the flight speed of a
laden european swallow, then add your favorite color, and substract your name.
Okay, so that's the high-speed write implementation, don't forget that the high
speed read implementation is the opposite of the write, so reverse the sort and
this time, make sure you use random sort. (That is toss the bits up randomly,
and if they wind up in the order you wanted, you're done, otherwise keep
tossing.)  And don't forget that tossed bits require Ranch dressing or Italian,
with onion crutons, but never Russian (because the USSR never used DES.)
Now that we've told you the secret of high speed DES, your assignment is to
come back in a week with source code to the above written in SNOBOL which can
run on CP/M 6502 machines.  Of course you'll need to roll your own CP/M 6502 OS
as well as a SNOBOL compiler and assembler, but heck, that's easy.  Oh, one
catch, make sure your CP/M runs on all C64 and Apple II's, or you can't
properly consider it a portable DES implementation.
Good luck.

     Thank you for bringing this up for our attention. First of all, let me
assure you that the undocumented access level for the LANplex/Corebuilder
products are purely for support reasons then anything else. We have many
cases where customers will forget their passwords or userids and find
themselves in a spot as they could not get in to the console. This is the
only way we can help them to recover from this situation without losing
their entire configuration. As far as I know, many vendors also have some
kind of special access methods to assist their customer under such
circumstances.These special access methods are for 3 Com support persons
only and are revealed to customers under very special circumstances.
Because the CoreBuilders/LanPlex are typically deployed at the core of a
network, the config for these equipment is typically complex and very
important to the customers. As such, these method can safe the customer a
lot of time and inconvenience by recovering their proper access to the
equipment. If we have to set these equipment to factory default every time
a customer lose his/her password, we will be in a lot of trouble.
As for the stackables, I believe we do not have this access method. That's
because these equipment is plug n play and do not have many parameters to
reconfigure. In the event, a customer loses his/her password, we can just
set everything back to factory default.

This is still unexcusable.  It would have been just as simple to include a
hidden reset switch in a pannel somewhere that would zap all the passwords
on the router without zapping the config, and maybe send some alarms out
via SNMP incase it wasn't something that was wanted.
That would be something the client could do themselves without opening
security holes.
That doesn't mean that the ankle biters won't find them.  For example, I could
put a sniffer on the network coming into the router and call up tech support
and say "Hi" I lost my password, here's my IP address, help, help.
I can then do the same thing a week later with the same router incase the
hash is time dependant, and then later with another router with a different
serial number, and I'll have much info to get started on how your hash works.
Piece of cake.

Yep, I ignore them completely.  A few of those search here type things did

they're large, annoying, and animated.  Typically, soon as I see the page fully
load I hit ESC or the Stop icon to prevent these evil horrors from popping up.
A much more evil thing that I've seen when visiting pages of tripod or other
free web site members and now warehouse.com are actual Java Japplets or
JavaScripts that pop up another window with an advertisement.  Tripod or one of
those (I tend to try and forget the ads as hard as I can) has also taken to
putting a TV like lower right corner logo that hangs around, even when you
scroll the window -- what's really nasty about these fucking things is that
they scroll a bit with the window, then jump back to the bottom.
What's next?  In your face pop up Gif89 movies with AU/WAV sound tracks that
can't be dismissed until they play completely before you get to see the content
Some places (like Wired?) are annoying since they have a window that's 1/3
content with ads on top and on the side and bottom.  I'm trying to read the
fucking article, not trying to be distracted by the flashing, flickering eye
sores to the right and left. :(
Some of the really fucked up sites actually have porno ads with porn in them,
which makes them real welcome if I ever visit a page from my work.  I wouldn't
mind the pr0n if I was at home, but such things are frowned upon at work, and
fuck, I didn't even ask to see the shit... :(
Talk about feeping creatureism.  This is about as bad as flashing HTML was in
its inception.
Sure you can disable JavaScript, but if you do some sites won't work at all.
Ditto for Japplets.
Might be nice to have some sort of filter list for browsers that says "If GIF89

@_subject: Goldbach's Conjecture - a question about prime sums of odd numbers 
Well, I suppose negative numbers can't be included because 1 can't be included:
1*1*1*1=1 and the idea is that a prime can only have itself and 1 as factors,
where 1 can be factored by itself over and over to an infinite number of 1's,
and by that definition you can exclude -1 since -1=(-1*1*-1*1), and so if
we take -5 and factor it to -5 and 1 it's good, but it can also be factored
to -1 and 5.  IMHO 1 and -1 being shunned in this way is a bit silly, but
whatever... :^)  (Same applies to zero since 0=0*0*0*0*0, but zero has the
built in difference of that it can't be divided by itself at all.)
So I guess I have to take back 7+5+(-1) and go with Jim's 1+3+7, but fuck,
that won't work either since 1 isn't a prime...  So I guess Igor is right on
this one.  Sorry Jim... Any other ideas on 11?

Actually the issue is 1=1*1, 1=1*1*1 ... 1=1^n.  If 1 is prime, then -1 must
be prime since -1=1^n where n is odd and 1=1^n where any n is used.  The fact
that 1 can be factored from itself recursively is the issue.
(If the above weren't true, then -1 could be prime without affecting whether
-3's lack of primality: -3=-1*3 and -3=1*-3.)

Reply-To: Bob Margolis Sender: owner-spooks at qth.net
February 26, 1998
Senator Lauch Faircloth
317 Hard Senate Office Building
United States Senate
Washington, DC 20510
Senator Faircloth:
I am very concerned with recently published reports, which conclude that the Central Intelligence Agency was not involved in drug activity in connection with their activities in Latin America.
As a former Central Intelligence Agency officer I had direct knowledge of matters which may be relevant in this matter.
During the period of January 1986 until July 1990 I was assigned as the lead Computer Systems Analyst Programmer to a facility which was initially called Project Koral during the building phase in 1985, but upon activation was known as BYJURY within the Office of Communications (DA/OC) although this designation was later changed to OC/MIAMI. Our callsign was KKN39 and our routing indicators was RUEG and RUEGMI. Because it operated under the guise of being a U.S. Army facility it was also known as the United States Army Regional Communication Agency/National Communications System and telegraphically as RRF MIAMI. However, at no time did the facility ever support any DOD efforts. The primary mission of this facility was to support the activities of the Continuity of Government project which was identified by project cryptonyms as CHALLIS, FESTIVE, FENCER, FEDDER, PEGASUS and ZEUS and in this role the name of the facility was Atlantic Relay Facility I (ARF-
1). The overall umbrella organization for this effort was initially known as NEISS, later as NEISO and finally as SIO and at one point had space located in the basement of the Tysons Corner mall in Vienna,  The facility itself was located on U.S. Government property, which was known locally as the Richmond Naval Air Station. This same property was also the location of a University of Miami Primate Research Center, a Marine Corps Reserve unit, the Central Intelligence Facility and another NEISO activity which was identified as a unit of the U.S. Army 7th Signal Corps but which was known with NEISO as CPIC-East.
The OC/MIAMI facility was staffed with approximately 15 people. A facility manager, a senior watch officer, a station engineer, a programmer analyst, three electronic technicians, an administrative assistant and 7 communications officers. Because the activities in support of the NEISO operations was minimal in peacetime, the facility was used by the Office of Communications as a major relay to provide linkages between several CIA facilities in Southern Florida (LA/MIAMI, FR/MIAMI, Miatech, FBIS Key West) and several other sites in the Caribbean and South America. In addition we also periodically provided telecommunications service to other CIA facilities whose primary relay was the Office of Communications relay facility near Culpepper, Virginia which was known for years as YOGURT but was later known as BYJAMS and still later as OC/BRANDY with a callsign of KKN50 and a routing indicator of RUES.
By now I hope you realize that I did have access to the information which I am about to convey. The information given above can be verified by the CIA, although they will be extremely reluctant to do so since the extent of the NEISO project was withheld from Congress
About a 18 months after my arrival at the facility we were informed that we would be the primary relay facility for a small station which was established on Swan Island in support of a variety of operations which were being conducted as part of our support for the CIA's efforts in Nicaragua. This facility was centered on an airstrip, which was used as a base of operations for pilots who were dropping supplies to the rebels, which the CIA was supporting.
The communications setup for this facility was something that we called a flyaway package. Basically it consisted of a HF transmitter/receiver a PC-based communications terminal and a KG-84 encryption device.
The KG-84 was considered to be one of the most secure cryptographic devices in use at that time. It came into universal use by the CIA after it became known that the Walker's had compromised the KW-7 in 1985. When the encrypted signal was received at BYJURY, it was decrypted through one of our KG-84 devices and from there the signal was passed to the SPARS message switch in unencrypted form. However, much of the traffic, which was transmitted on this circuit, was super-
enciphered with One-Time-Tape (OTT). This was extremely unusual under the circumstances since electronic encryption was considered quite adequate for secure CIA communications. I know from personal experience as a communications officer prior to becoming a computer programmer that except for annual exercises to maintain proficiency in one-time-
tape techniques, there was essentially no usage of one-time-tape for circuits which had secure communications circuitry. The fact that this particular station was using one-time-tape over a secure circuit was noted by all of the communicators at BYJURY and while we did not have any means whereby to decipher the messages further, it was broadly speculated that there was something happening on Swan Island which was so sensitive that it could not be entrusted to normal electronic encryption. When you consider that most Talent Keyhole and Rapport data was only afforded normal encryption, the volume of one-time-tape usage by this station can only be viewed as extremely noteworthy.
If Congress decides to investigate this matter further, I also need to add that the CIA will probably state that the messages, which were transmitted to and receive from this station are no longer held. This is totally inaccurate. All message traffic into and out of CIA Headquarters is held in local storage for several weeks and after that time is no longer routinely available. However, for many years now there have been backup copies of the traffic which are transmitted on a daily basis to an off-site storage facility at Station A of the Warrenton Training Center where it is transferred to magnetic tape for permanent archives. It is highly likely that the CIA will deny that this archiving takes place because even the head of the Office of Communications probably does not realize that this is occurring since this is considered a low-level routine administrative task and quite often CIA managers above the GS-14 level simply do not have any understanding or knowledge of the actual working of the communications network. If the CIA does deny that the archiving occurs you may wish to use the power of congress to pursue the matter until they admit that the records do exist. While the actual magnetic tapes may have been replaced by more permanent storage such as CDROMS, I can pretty much assure you that the storage does exist.
I am providing this information because after the extremely harsh and discriminatory treatment, which I experienced during the period of 1989-1992, I no longer feel any sense of loyalty to the CIA nor do I feel that I have any obligations to them. They were wrong in treating me the way that they did and demonstrated that they preferred to take the word of a senior manager who habitually drank alcohol while performing in his position and they preferred to protect those who were engaged in sexual improprieties. On top of that they also manipulated the federal court system to ensure that they received decisions which favored their point of view. There are apparently several federal judges and U.S. Attorney's who have profited enormously by making decisions, which prevented my case from ever being adequately heard in If congress is interested I could also provide information which would tend to indicate that senior officials within the Office of Communications engaged in misuse of government funds and in which official books were manipulated to make it look as if money was being spent for official purposes when, in fact, it was being spent for the benefit of senior managers in a fraudulent and wasteful manner.
After all of these years I still remain angry over the treatment I received. When I became a government employee I fully intended to serve an entire career in government service, but when I was faced with treatment which was so harsh, punitive and discriminatory and when all recourse was denied to me by the so-called statutory Inspector-General of the CIA and his minions, I was placed in a position in which I had to leave government service for my own protection since I could no longer predict the capricious actions by those who held the power to make the live of an employee miserable. They were wrong in what they did and there is simply no excuse for permitting managers to have such power to destroy a human being. I can never forgive their actions and at this point the only way that I can deal with my anger is to communicate exact details of matters which I experienced as an employee in hopes that I can bring shame to the Agency. As a human being I deserved a certain level of dignity and I received none. Government agencies should be held to a standard whereby no employee is discriminated against for any reason.
Please contact me if any additional information is needed on this subject. All information in this letter is in the public domain and may be disseminated freely.

Reply-To: Bob Margolis Sender: owner-spooks at qth.net
BT condemned for listing cables to US sigint station
     4 September, 1997
     A judge has lambasted BT for revealing detailed information about top secret high capacity cables feeding phone and
     other messages to and from a Yorkshire monitoring base. BT admitted this week that they have connected three digital
     optical fibre cables - capable of carrying more than 100,000 telephone calls at once - to the American intelligence base
     at Menwith Hill, near Harrogate.
     Menwith Hill is run by the US National Security Agency (NSA), which monitors the world's communication for US
     intelligence. NSA acknowledges that "the Hill" is the largest electronic monitoring station in the world. Over 1,200 US
     civilians and servicemen work round the clock at the base, intercepting and analysing communications mainly from
     Europe, Russia and the Middle East.
     Much of the information reaching the base comes from spy satellites. The base has 26 large white golfballs or "radomes"
     for space communications, making it an inescapable landmark in the Yorkshire dales.
     In a courtroom fiasco this week, British Telecom's solicitors first sent documents and a witness to give details of the
     cables to York Crown Court, where two women campaigners were appealing against conviction for trespassing at the
     station. The next day, they sent a second solicitor to attempt to silence their own witness and to withdraw evidence
     already given.
     Judge Jonathan Crabtree agreed to grant public interest immunity "BT had no business whatsoever to disclose anything
     of the kind", he said. He then ordered Mr R.G. Morris, BT's head of emergency planning, not to give any more evidence
     about the secret cables.
     After being privately briefed in his chambers by BT's second solicitor, the judge said that it was immaterial if Menwith
     Hill was spying on British citizens and commercial communications and may have cost British companies in billions of
     dollars of lost sales.
     "The national interest of the United Kingdom, even if if is conducted dishonestly, requires this to be kept
     secret", said Judge Crabtree.
     "The methods of communicating to and from Menwith Hill, whether military intelligence or commercial spying, is clearly
     secret information. The governments of the United States and United Kingdom do not want this information to be
     divulged", he explained.
     But he said that BT's list of secret cables in and out of Menwith Hill could not be withdrawn from the case. "Half the cat
     is out of the bag. The contents of the letter are now in public domain. I just don't know what BT think they were doing",
     he added.
     According to the letter, the Post Office (now BT) first provided two high capacity "wide bandwidth" circuits to Menwith
     Hill in 1975. They were connected on a coaxial cable to the BT network at Hunters Stones, a microwave radio station a
     few miles from the US base.
     During the 1970s and 1980s, almost all Britain's long-distance telephone calls were carried on the microwave network
     of which Hunters Stones is part. The existence of the cables connecting the network to Menwith Hill has been known
     since 1980, but the authorities have always refused to comment. BT now claims that the cables were connected directly
     to the United States via undersea cable, and did not link to other parts of the British system.
     The system was upgraded in 1992, says BT, when a new high capacity optical fibre cable was installed. This linked to a
     different part of the BT network, but was also carried directly to the United States via undersea cable. Since then, BT
     revealed, the capacity of the system has been trebled by adding two more optical fibre links. These could carry more
     than 100,000 simultaneous telephone calls.
     Lawyers for the two women campaigners, Helen John and Anne Lee, say they were astonished by the company's
     sudden change of heart. They said that the letter giving details of the cables may have been written for PR purposes, and
     appeared intended to suggest that BT wasn't helping NSA tap telephones. This, BT said, was a "misapprehension which
     is damaging to this company's reputation".
     BT staff also hinted that other British communications companies are supplying tapping capacity to the American base.
     Even as BT's solicitor was seeking to have his evidence prohibited, BT's witness was outside court giving further
     information to the women's solicitor implying that other British communications companies were also involved in the
     spying activities at Menwith Hill. "You should ask me about other companies", he said before he was silenced.
     Tony Benn - who was the Postmaster General at the time cables were first installed connecting Menwith Hill to the
     British communications network - also gave evidence. He said that although a Cabinet minister and privy councillor, he
     had been told nothing of the secret arrangements with the Americans.
     BT were ordered to pay the legal costs caused by their change of heart. The judge accused them of giving away
     confidential commercial information and national secrets. "If I had a burglar alarm system, I would now think twice about
     having it operated by BT", he said.

@_subject: propose: `cypherpunks license' (Re: Wanted: Twofish source code) 
Untrue.  Person P may make proprietary versions of the program, however,
the program's users may simply chose to not use them and instead take
the original public domain program, write their own modifications as needed
and do what they will with them.  In fact, they may even develop a function
clone of Person P's program and put it back in the Public Domain if they
so chose.  How does this restrict anyone?  Oh, they can't code you say?  Well, too bad,
if they want to use other people's code, let them learn.  If one choses to
learn to code, one frees himself.
Nobody is forcing those users to use Person P's code any more than
anyone is being forced to use Windoze 98.
Cypherpunks Write Code is something I believe in, and practice.   For
example, someone today needed to modify several bytes in a binary file
that got corrupted in transit.  Not having any sort of hex editor he asked
if I knew what I could use.  I told him to try gdb or adb and such, but
he wasn't able to, so I wrote the bit of code following this message.
Now, I could make this trivial bit of code proprietary and charge money for
it, but others could simply spend some time and write their own.  I could
make it GPL, and thus let everyone use it, but nobody would be able to
copy this code and incorporate it in their code if they didn't want to make their code GPL'ed.  So instead, I am making this available as
public domain.  Do what you like with it.  Hell, if you'd like go ahead
and modify it and GPL it, do so, but that won't stop anyone wishing to make
commercial versions of it from finding this original bit of code rather
than the GPL.  Nor will it stop anyone who just wants to use the code.
So what's the point?  As long as public domain software exists and can
be tracked down and use, it frees everyone.  GPL on the other hand does
not.  Sure, it frees the users, but limits the authors.
Of course the GPL has one advantage that you forgot to mention (or that
I haven't noticed.)  Should Microsoft decide to grab Linux and produce
Microsoft Linux (with or without the GNU utilities) they'd have to
produce their sources.

What pisses me off is that in NYC the gas prices are ridiculous high...
$1.35/Gal is the regular gas, drive just a few miles over a tunnel or bridge to n NJ, it's $1.00 or $.99 depending on which pump you hit...  go a bit south,
say VA, and in some areas it drops as low as $0.87 a gallon!
Shit, if it weren't for the tolls and the drive, I'd be getting my gas out of
NYC all the time, but doing so wastes enough and costs enough in tolls to not
make it worth the effort...
Just out of curiosity what are prices around where you guys live?
Yep... saw one at Barnes & Noble a while ago bitching about how he got a
plastic bag.  We'll, if he's worried that plastic is bad for the environment,
he should worry about the murdered tree in his hand that he just purchased...
Ditto for militant vegans... it's one thing to do it for health reasons, it's
another to be an asshole about killing fuzzy animals.. hey veggies are alive
too.  If you're gonna murder veggies to live, (whose growth results in the
death of millions of insects who would devour the veggies if not for
insecticides) you may as well quit being a hypocrite and murder animals too...
The only way for a consciencious objecting vegan to not be a hypocrite is to
simply stop eating and drinking and breathing... after all, every time he does
so, he inhales, ingests, or otherwise murders billions of microbes... :)
(Whenever someone asks if I have special dietary needs, I say "I'm a carnivore,

By far the worst is the recycling law in NYC.  If you don't recycle your trash,
you get fined.  If a homeless bum sticks his hand in a recycling bin and grabs
a paper he gets arrested for theft of government property, etc...  If someone
throws a can of soda in your trash bins infront of your house, you pay a $50

@_subject: Spot The Fed / ICMP, UDP, and traceroute 
Not quite true.  traceroute does use DNS.  If you do traceroute it will use dns to resolve it to an ip.  If you do traceroute 10.0.0.1, it
will use dns to resolve it to a name.   At every hop, it will use reverse
DNS to resolve the ip's to names.  If a hop doesn't have a reverse, you see
it's ip.
Traceroute under unix uses UDP on some high random port.  Traceroute on NT
(TRACERT.EXE) uses ICMP.  In both cases, it sets the TTL field to 1, and sends
a message.  The router dropping the message responds with ICMP telling your
host, "packet dropped due to ttl" -- this returns that router's ip address to
you.   (For non TCP heads - each packet has a TTL - time to live field that
gets decreased as the packet "hops" across a router.  When the TTL reaches
zero, the next router to receive it drops it and returns an error to the
sender.  This mechanism is used to prevent router loops from brining down all
the networks in the loop among other things like tracing a route...)
One can hide routers by making them ignore ICMP or not respond to ICMP.  In
such cases, you simply get time outs (a line with 3 *'s)...
A good test is to use traceroute from NT/95 and another from unix so you can
tell what's filtered.

@_subject: Larry Gilbert, AOLers, and the Hyper-real flamer 
Right.  Considering the scum that have drifted on here from AOL, I'd say
there's a distinct pattern.  As an EX-AOL user I can attest to the fact that
AOL is prime grade USRDA shit.  At the time I got nothing but busy signals and
crashes, when I logged back in, I was told I was already logged on and had to
call the customer unsupport people to get credit for my hours used by a ghost
connection.  Further, in the last few weeks I had my account, I received
hundreds of spams, the "You've Got Mail" soundbite caused me to twitch every
time I heard it.
Paying $20/month for shit service with a shit browser and shit connectivity
isn't my idea of a good ISP.  A few weeks after, I found a local ISP that gave
me a shell account for $10/month and I got no busy signals and no bullshit
software and no craploads of downloads of images ("artwork") or fifty ads
popping in my face upon connecting.
So yeah, maybe there are "smart" people on AOL, but they're clueless when it
comes to ISP since they're using the worst of the worst.
I don't speak for that "nobody" but I will speak for myself and will speak from
PERSONAL experience.  Aol is shit.  Anyone who is stupid enough to put up with
shit service is either masochistic or isn't aware they're getting shit service,
no matter how intelligent they may otherwise be.  besides, from the cluless
fuckwads that have indeed drifted here, I'd sooner hug the hotmail users, even
the single celled one who spews about Misty than see an AOL luser's email
address in a post!
If you're so smart, find a local ISP who will give you better service and costs
less.  Shit, if you insist on paying $20/month and $5 hour, tell you what,
switch to a cheaper ISP and send me the extra $5/hour you are now wasting, I
sure could use the money!
Just my $0.02 worth of flames.

I see this as well and agree with it.  The recent stock market rocking back and

I don't necessarily see this.  What do you base this on?  Outside of where I
live, there is an elementary school.  Young kids these days are made to wear
UNIFORMS and carry ID's and can only go to school with see through bags and
must pass through metal detectors and/or be frisked.
Further, one of the local newspapers (Times? Daily News? Post?) here in NYC had
some story about how the city school security will be taken over by the police
department, effectively turning schools into jails.  IMHO, this won't turn out
delinquents, this will turn out slaves who are used to being treated as slaves,
are used to having no freedoms and don't expect them; they'll live without
privacy and they'll like it.  Those are your kids America: sheep!
Mindless slaves rarely rebel; unless you take away their MTV and their Sony
Playstations I doubt this.
Doubt it.  Unless they can't get food or money, or IF there are massive
blackouts they will riot, but will do so to break into stores and loot.

What's this bullshit, eh?  Just overwrite the BIOS roms in your machine to
return all zeros for the sectors you don't want to show them.  Have some
special passphrase you have to type in while in the BIOS setup program to
deactivate this.  Most newer notebooks have flash upgradeable ROMs anyway.
Better yet, simply have it report a drive size that's much smaller than what
you really have.  i.e. install a 4gb drive, but have the bios only see it as a
1gb disk.  When software tries to read or write beyond the 1gb space, have it
return errors like a real disk would.
Anyone who knows x86 assembly can do this sort of shit.  If you want to get
real wicked on this or are afraid they'll have software that talks directly to
the IDE controller, take apart the disk controller card on the drive itself
and give it this type of functionality (much harder.)  Hell, even if they
switch to taking out your hard drive out of your notebook and duplicating it,
as long as the HD itself reports LESS space than it really has, they can't get
to it, they can't scan it, they can't copy it, they can't overwrite it.
Don't want to do that or can't?  Okay, boot their software in a Virtual CPU
box, and if they try to access I/O directly, have your code intercept and
emulate the access.  They try to run privilidged opcodes, trap'em and make it
look like they're running fine, etc...
Let's get this nice and clear once and for all: Software running on untrusted
(i.e. your notebook) hardware cannot be trusted as it can be fooled and
modified by it.  It doesn't matter how sophisticated their scanning software is
as long as the hardware DOESN'T COMPLY with it's requests.  Software always
asks the hardware to do things for it.  The hardware doesn't have to obey. :)
The solution to getting around this bullshit is in hardware or firmware.
I will ignore Anon's idiotic idea of them comparing blank space before and
after.  That's stupid for one of several very obvious reason: temp files.  If
that's not clear enough, here's another: defrag.

Ah hem! To quote myself:
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
By "this" I mean the method of not allowing access to the hidden cylinders.  By
deactivating, I mean disabling the routine that hides the hidden cylinders,
thus letting you access the partition.
This means that you wouldn't be typing in the special passphrase in front of
the Customs official.  It means that when >YOU< wish to use your encrypted partition (in the privacy
of your hotel root), you would type in the passphrase to activate it's
visibility and accesibility to the rest of your machine.  Further that BY DEFAULT, the hidden space on the drive (preferably a partition)
would normally not be reported by the bios hiding the true number of cylinders
from the OS's.
How?  You won't type in the passphrase in front of them.   You'll let the bios
do its thing and HIDE the extra partion from their scanner.

All stego methods are weak approaches at hiding data.  The point is to hide the
fact that there is hidden data and make it look like the notebook is a
perfectly normal unmodified notebook.  There's no perfect stego method that
cannot be detected by a determined analyzer.  You can hide all the data you
want in the low bits, but they naturally have biases (low entropy) that if not
present indicates stego (which has high entropy.)
Who the fuck is gonna run a tempest scanner on your notebook again?  Let's
stick to the scope of this: UK scans of your notebook using bootable floppies.
And tell me, if you were to modify your BIOS to get around this, WHY would you
need a tempest monitor?
Why would you need to collect BIOSes?  You only need to modify a single BIOS -
the one on >YOUR< notebook.  The camouflage code would be a few hundred bytes
at most unless you do something overly elaborate.
An EEPROM burner (which for flash upgradeable notebooks isn't needed) is fairly
cheap. JDR sold them for about $200 or less.  For flashable BIOSes this is
Disassemblers (debuggers) are fairly cheap. DOS and WIN95 come with a simple
one called debug.  BIOSes run in 16 bit mode since booting requires that PC's
run in 16 bit mode and there are plenty of books and info on 16 bit x86
programming.  You don't need to disasemble everything in the BIOS, you just
need to disable the checksum routine the bios uses on itself, and you need to
slightly modify the place that detects the size of the IDE drive to not go
beyond a certain number of pointers.
Further, PC bioses do support BIOS extensions, you generally wouldn't need to
modify the existing BIOS very much at all.  If you can add a BIOS extension,
the existing BIOS will happily run code from it.  This is how SCSI adapters
provide booting capabilities from SCSI disks.  Of course it's a bit harder in a
notebook computer, but it too can be done.
Back in the days of the Commodore 64 which had only mono sound, it was fairly
comon to piggy back and solder a second sound chip on top of the existing one
with the exception of a few of the pins, and turn your C64 into a stero
machine.  (One of the pins was an address pin, the other were sound out.)  A
similar thing might be done with an EEPROM.
The way BIOSes work is that they can be set to either detect the IDE drive size
always, or just once.  Set them to NOT detect.  They store the drive type
(0-47) and size params in the battery backed up CMOS.  An easy, but less effective thing to do is to simply write over the CMOS data
that says X cylinders, Y heads, Z sectors/track, and modify the partition table
a bit.   You can do both from DEBUG.  You'll have to write a tiny bit of
assembly, but not much.
But again, if they bypass the BIOS and talk directly to the IDE controller,
none of these techniques - short of modifying the IDE controller or drive,
won't work.
You forgot to say "If you get caught." :)  With successful stego, nobody other
than the owner knows that it's there.
If you visit France and have a notebook computer, expect the Ministry of
Whatever to sneak in your hotel room when you're not there and copy your
notebook's hard drive anyway.  Such things have been reported as industrial
espionage.  (Talk to the folks on the spyking list about getting refrences.)
One thing all you fine folks are forgetting is that there are MANY MANY types
of notebooks out there.  My money says that if they can't scan Mac's they also
won't be able to scan Sparc books, Alpha Books, Newtons, Palm Pilots, and many
WinCE palmtops either.  Just buy something exotic.
You don't need to over engineer this, keep in mind: what they're using are
use-once floppies which are discarded.  A floppy at most holds 1.7Mb of code. This code is used to SCAN your disk for contraband.  I don't know what they
scan for, but they aren't going to be able to fit decoders for EVERY type of
file system and every file format out there.
So far the viable non-bullshit, non-fictional solutions in order of ease of
0. Don't go to the UK with a notebook computer.
1. Use FedEx.
2. Store the data on some other form of media (PC card disks, CD's, books, etc)
3. Use a non PC notebook that they can't scan, or one that can't use floppies
   or PCMCIA floppy drives in case they've got some around.
4. Modify the CMOS values in your notebook and your parition table.
5. Modify your BIOS to report a smaller disk
6. Same as 5 but prevent writes to the hidden space.
7. Have your BIOS not boot from floppies and boot only from the hard disk
   but make it look like it's booting normally, then run some sort of sandbox
   or emulator and let their software run under your code's control.
8. Modify your IDE controller or the controller card on the disk.
I say choice 0 is the best choice. :^)  Can we end this noisy thread or are
there other bright ideas?

Come on guys, this is silly. Why the fuck would the UK tempest scan your notebooks?  Manufacturers produce new machines every month, each with modified
BIOSes for the features in their new notebooks, with hardware variations and imperfection, with different power levels of batteries, different PC cards
installed, different CPU speeds, different options and other inconsistencies
you get a very difficult situation.  Your speculation that someone out there will tempest scan to see if you've

Steganography is the art of hiding data.  Hiding disk partions IMHO falls
under this.  Hiding data in the LSBits of bytes is only an EXAMPLE of stego, it
doesn't define stego.  Even the subject of this message says Stego Empty hard
drives conforming to this definition.
Why would they implement it when they can simply have their software scan the
BIOS code if that's what they feared?  It may cost them $10k each, but it'll
cost them millions to design and scan every notebook type on the planet, and
then they'll have to get their hands on newer models as soon as they hit the

Why should YOUR BIOS need to contain encryption code or device drivers for that

certain value.  As rusty and as fucked as my x86 code is this shows the general
You patch your BIOS by replacing a few bytes of code with CALL's and NOP's. Maybe 4-8 bytes at most to modify.  The routine that checks for the track range
is only several bytes:

re                      RET
Homework: Someone please take this code, optimize it for size and build a TSR
patching INT 13 that JIM can install and run under DOS.
Whoop... that takes less than 25 bytes of code to implement for each of the INT
13 functions.  If you don't believe me, run debug and type in some similar
code.  All it needs to do is to check if the hack is in place, if so, check the
cylinder/track # being accessed.  If it's bigger than your limit, return an
error, otherwise allow it.  Where's the big fucking several K of code there?
A few more lines of code to implement the hidden switch code and you're set. Maybe modify the routine that checks for ESC to skip the memory check or DEL to
enter the setup, what another 25 byte patch?
Once you find out where the bios does it's checksum, you NOP that entire
section out, or recalculate the checksum yourself if you want to be anal. This
doesn't add any extra bytes.
Or if you're truly insanly paranoid, modify the bios password routine so that
if you type in a certain password it toggles the hacked mode on or off.  Maybe
a 100 byte patch at most.
Semantics.  I can use debug to disassemble a ROM bios and trace through it.  It
does the fucking job.  Sure, it doesn't translate symbols or do anything fancy,
but it's enough to do what >THIS< project requires.
Yeah, and each of those hundreds of types of notebooks have their own MODIFIED
BIOSES with various patches and flash updates.  Good luck collecting a copy of
EVERY version of EVERY bios for EVERY brand of notebook made in various
countries with various languages, options, and other permutations.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, next thing you'll tell me is that they'll start to stick
people in MRI machines to scan for drugs.  Sure, you can do whatever you like
if you've got infinite resources.  Show me someone who does.

Yes, and depending on the threat model this was about 5-6 on the last I've last

controller, or you build a CPU emulator.  There is one that's freely available
called Bochs which will do this.  They can happily boot from their floppy and
talk directly to your virtual "hardware" and you still get through.
Yeah, I know, ol'e paranoid Jim will reply to this using the word "Tempest"

MRI and XRay scans of your body?  Hell, why don't they buy electron tunneling
microscopes just incase you might have encoded your data on the surface of that
perfectly innocent looking CD jewel case in which you're carrying your music?
Shaaa, now that I've shown you how, of course you already know how to do that. Now that I've shown you the code and told you how it works, of course to you it
would stand out like a sore thumb because you know what to look for.  The
question is will it stand out to the minimum wage customs drone?  You seem to
think these guys are actually super spies, not clueless overpaid (for their
level of skills) bored burrowcrats working on an assembly line.  You're over
estimating their abilities by at least four orders of magnitude there.
Gee, I bet you use RSA with 65536 bits too and superencrypt with 3DES, IDEA,
and Blowfish and Misty.

Police Superintendents' Conference: Stewart Tendler on how science is catching
up with the criminal. DNA detectives will fit a face to a flake of skin A SINGLE flake of dandruff
will soon be enough for scientists to build up a criminal's photofit, police
commanders were told yesterday. Experts believe they will be able to create
"genetic e-fits", using information gleaned from a DNA sample to build a
picture of a suspect's race, build, eye and hair colour, and even behavioural
characteristics. Within a year, forensic scientists will be able to take DNA
samples from minute scraps of skin left at the scene of a burglary and from
such surfaces as the steering wheel of a stolen car, the keyboard of a
computer and the outside of a drink can. They will be able to identify DNA
from the
wrappings round illegal drugs that dealers and couriers had hidden in their
bodies. The photofit will be available within a decade. It will include the height of
the suspect and other details including the shape of the ears and chin and
inherited physical defects. The DNA advances were forecast yesterday by Kevin Sullivan, DNA research and
development manager for the Forensic Science Service, speaking to the annual
conference of the Police Superintendents' Association in Bristol. He said that
genetic profiling was the "Holy Grail" for scientists but would be achieved
within ten years, aided by international work on gene identification. Dr Sullivan, who worked on the identification of the remains of the last Tsar,
Nicholas II, said that the breakthrough in taking DNA samples from dandruff
would allow investigators to take material from the tiny particles of human
skin that are found at every scene. He said: "People are constantly shedding
skin cells. The majority of household dust is made up of dead skin and we know
we can get DNA from an individual skin cell." He said that an armed robber could be tracked down by DNA evidence taken
within 12 months from flakes of dandruff left behind in a discarded
balaclava. It
is a person's DNA, contained in every cell in the body, which predicts an
range of characteristics including skin, hair and eye colour, bone structure
and even propensity to some illnesses and personality traits. He told the conference that DNA testing had become "1,000 times more
sensitive" in the past decade. Whereas ten years ago scientists needed a
bloodstain the
size of a 10p piece to conduct a test, they now required just a pin-prick
invisible to the naked eye. DNA samples would soon be used to re-examine unsolved sex cases and could even
be used in miscarriage-of-justice cases. Scientists were working on ways of
extracting DNA from sperm samples taken many years ago and still being
stored. New developments meant it was possible to identify bodies that had been hidden
for some time. DNA can be taken from hair shafts in the skull, from bone and
faeces and matched with the mothers of possible victims. Work was developing on portable DNA testing facilities which could be used at
the scenes of crimes to speed up investigations. Dr Sullivan said mass
screening in major inquiries had grown. Since the first screening in 1987,
in a double murder case in Leicestershire, there had been 91 screening
in Britain involving 26,000 samples. Offenders were identified in 30 cases and
in one case a suspect walked into a police station and gave himself up when
DNA screening was announced by police. Dr Sullivan said that in the next five years scientists would improve the
collection of DNA samples from blood and saliva left on surfaces such as
cigarettes. Further work on identifying DNA in animals would begin next year.
He said this could be used to solve crimes against humans. Children who were
assaulted sometimes left hairs from their pets on the clothing of their
attackers, which could be used to identify suspects. Tim Robarts - t.robarts at btinternet.com -
6) From: Will Smith Hi there. Do you know of any stealth program's the will stop my
movement being tracked on the net  i.e.:  where in surfing, what sites i'm
going to, what OS i'm running ect, my e-mail address ect...
like a real-time netshield or fire-wall?
to keep the $pooks from trackin me online?

Simple.  You set the bios to boot off the hard drive.  You could even set your
notebook to sleep, then when they ask you to turn it on, you wake it and have
your emulator boot from the floppy.  This is especially effective if you
scratch up the case of your notebook and make it look older by modifying it's
case to look like it's a 486 or 386 to account for the difference in speed.
Shit, if you had the source to something like SoftPC or Virtual PC, you could
modify it to work on a Mac notebook (of course the nice Apple Logo would give
you away, but I'm sure you can figure out how to modify the case and the apple
I'll worry about them using TEMPEST scanners when I hear reports that say
they're using it.  Until such time, you're being overly paranoid.
Until they start, this point is moot.  In any case the answer to that silly
idea is tempest shield your box, but include RF transmitters in various places
outside the shielding to emit the frequencies that a normal unaltered notebook
would transmit.
