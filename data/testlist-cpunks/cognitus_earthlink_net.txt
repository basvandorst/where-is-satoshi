Also, even the private-switch operations selling cash-paid calling cards
have records of the calls made on their systems, though those records
might not be in a form that makes them readily linkable to the orginator
of a given call--it all depends on how much it's worth to the pursuer to
pursue you.

I remember discussing the changes with a friend around 1991. At the time
I was reading the changes noted to the law in IRS publication no. 17. I
believe it is also noted on Form 1040 (look in the area used for
children's SSN, it should be ref. in the instructions). Between the two
of these, you should get a pointer to the code, and all of these are
available online. The IRS is the only agency, that I have know, of using
this law and, again, I think that congress made it law c. '91.

Yes, perjury, conspiracy, and other possible felonies seem to be much
more in evidence--for now.

[...body of text snipped...]
It strikes me as alarming at times, when considering the condition of
civil liberties in this country and just how close government tries to
shave off freedoms that are not *explicit* in the bill of rights, how
poorer our liberties would be defended without those ten, basic
amendments; and further, that they were added as an after thought,
ridiculed by many, demanded by some, but they have proven to be one of
the last lines of defence between our liberties and this centralised,
law making den in Washington.  These ten are not nearly enough.

I take a view of liberty as I believe it exists under natural law.  Some
people view the constitution and bill of rights as the alpha and omega
of liberty on earth.  I am not one of them.
Most likey you're right.  In fact, most of the "founders" would be as
well, especially Patrick Henry! ;-)
