Recently, I wrote about forging mail and introduced the idea of

to which Jim McCoy responded:
That sounded reasonable to me until Crim Tideson asked:
So honor may after all have meaning in cyberspace, as some code of

James A. Donald, whose thinking I tend to respect, points out that,
I'm glad to take your word on this. But I still think that the cryptographic system can be broken: subversion, torture, and "truth
serums" come to mind. If someone strong enough wants your secret
badly enough, they can probably get it, as long as at least one keeper of the secret is alive. This argument relies on one's
adversary having no scruples. Since, as I mentioned before, I have
little knowledge of the mathematics of cryptography, but still share
the cypherpunks' interest in liberty, I'm focusing my efforts on the
social end of the solution. As I said:
to which JAD responded:
What do you mean by "dishonorable"? Is walking through a security
hole like walking through a stranger's insecure door? The latter is an invasion of privacy to me, something I would consider damaging to me and would label a "dishonorable" act.
Consider reputation systems, kill files, and the famous "If no one

and one that many people admit to imposing.
