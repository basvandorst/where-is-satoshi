: } Hi
: } : } Apologies if this is too much of a beginner's Q.
: } : } Does anyone know how to backup a "SecureDrive" partition onto tape : } quickly and easily.
: } : } HPACK is really slow.
: } : } PKZIP and then PGP is slow.
: } : } RAWDISK, seems to be quite complex (perhaps I am just stupid!), and I : } am terrified of making some sort of terrible mistake.
: } : } I have about 100MB in the partition.  I have a pretty out of date : } computer which is a 386 33MHz running Windows.
: : : Ease of backup is one of the strengths of CFS which is a cryptographic
: filesystem for various flavours of UNIX and Linux.
If you have Linux installed, you can backup your dos securedrive partition
by doing
cat /dev/hda2 >/dev/ftape
         ^^^^
         (or whatever your securedrive partition is)
No decrypting necessary.  If the partition is only 100MB then it ought to fit on a standard qic-80 tape.
