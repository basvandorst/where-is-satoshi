Security doesn't work that way.  Keeping your system secure is like
walking a tightrope across a gorge filled with ravenous tigers every
morning.  There are a billion ways to fuck up and get owned/eaten by the
tigers, and asking someone who's successfully walked the tightrope every
day for 40 years "tell me your secret?" completely misses the point.
The expert can share advice and point out when you're about to step off
the tightrope, but no kind of advice can substitute for your own caution
and experience.  Pretending that a magic balance bar, or a magic
technique that can be applied without careful thought, or a magic shoe
that will make you stick to the rope, will save you is the kind of thing
that works in a fairy tale but not in real life.
The analogy breaks down, though, because in fact you can get totally
owned, through and through; exfiltrated, impersonated, and strung up
by a prosecutor before a secret grand jury before you even learn that
your security has failed.  At least the tiger has the courtesy of giving
you pain when you fail.

I believe that there's no law or regulation preventing anyone from
writing open source implementations of GSM in the US.
However there definitely are regulations preventing the sale or
operation of unlicensed intentional emitters, and the FCC definitely
cares about the GSM bands.  Getting a license for an open source
implementation of GSM would likely be a large expense, which AFAIK no
open source implementor has even started to try to undertake.
There is also federal law prohibiting the sale of equipment which can
intercept wireless telephony communications.  Many scanners have
filters or programming/configuration jumpers which prevent reception of
the specific frequencies covered by the law.  Depending on the reading
and the zealousness of the prosecutor, such a law might be seen to be
relevant to an open source GSM platform.

I believe it's just a guess based on fit.
Suppose I'm the manager writing this document, reporting the expected
accomplishments of my group.  We do cryptanalysis.
If we're projecting success against FooBarCo chips' encryption sub-core,
and everybody knows FooBarCo chips are used in both encryption and
non-encryption products, it makes sense to cite the specific
applications where FooBarCo chips are used.  So "for FooBarCo chips used
in VPN and SSL" makes sense, even if FooBarCo chips are not *solely* VPN
and SSL.
However, in "for FooBarCo encryption chips used in VPN", the
"encryption" seems to me to denote a special purpose chip, rather than a
general purpose chip with an encryption sub-core.  I've seen worse
manglings of language in similar documents, though, so I would not put
it past said middle manager to write "for Intel Ivy Bridge encryption
chips used in VPN and SSL", even though that's a bit of word salad to
anyone who knows the technology.
"Cavium Networks" or "Cavium Nitrox" are approximately the right length
to fit.  Other vendors that might be interesting include F5, Barracuda,
Riverbed, Cisco SCA 11000, Radware (an Israeli/American company), and
everybody listed on The document looks like Word and appears to be fully justified; anyone

are perfectly aligned, to the sub-pixel antialiasing limit; while

for both, an enterprising DTP jockey could use -clean-1.pdf to tune the
document settings precisely, and then use -project.pdf to search for
better unredaction matches.

In reply to Declan tweeting about this discussion (shame on you, Declan,
if you're reading this and trying to take the discussion to the public),
Kevin Poulsen points out
that the Times' comment on this redaction appears to imply that the
redacted text names two chips:
    Large Internet companies use dedicated hardware to scramble traffic
    before it is sent. In 2013, the agency planned to be able to decode
    traffic that was encoded by one of these two encryption chips,
    either by working with the manufacturers of the chips to insert back
    doors or by exploiting a security flaw in the chips' design.
VPN gear lasts in the field for 2-5 years post roll-out.  Design wins
into large provider's hardware will often see the same chip being
manufactured for 2-5 years after it ceases being available at retail.
(ark.intel.com has an "embedded option available?" field to denote the
chips they support this for.)
"Complete Enablement" is jargon with a specific meaning.  I'm not
certain I understand it, but I *think* it means "we have plaintext
access on any targeted session".  I don't think it means "we can get
plaintext for an arbitrary previously recorded session" and I don't
think it means "we automatically get plaintext for every session we can
hear".  Suppose a NSA chip backdoor receives its triggering command by a
specific sequence of TCP retransmits (dropped packets) and after being
triggered, leaks the key by varying the timing or ordering of outbound
packets.  By my reading, this would count as "complete enablement" even
though a session which was not triggered would not be eavesdroppable.
To specifically respond to your point, "Complete enablement" is also
time dependent.  Productionizing a timing side channel attack could
result in complete enablement only for new flows and would still be
complete even though there was no enablement before the attack was
Especially taking the NYT commentary into account, I'm even more
convinced you're right.  "Intel and AMD" is about the right length...

All that said, there are still things that one Cannot Say when one has
$CORP on one's business card.  Just as a simple example, the doctrine
of "judicial notice" means that if an officer of a corporation makes a
public statement about something and the corporation does not publish a
correction, a court can assume that the statement is true in a later
civil proceeding.  The company can counter the presumption or clarify
the necessary context by presenting evidence, but it's expensive and
means you're burning minutes/pages on refuting nonsense.  So execs need
to be careful not to say, for example, that "$CORP has poor network
security" because that's food for a nuisance lawsuit.

I don't see any evidence or claim that the investigation touched,
investigated, or influenced any Tor relays in the published documents
about the Silk Road arrest.  Do you have any basis for this

less torture them, as the phrase "rubber hose" indicates) to install
The complaint and the indictment are stunningly silent on that part of
the investigation, and the press coverage I've seen also doesn't shed
much light on exactly how the machine in "a certain foreign country" was
located.  A few possibilities have been raised:
 - an investigator exploited the Silk Road software stack via its public
   web UI and caused the server to disclose its IP by connecting to a
   service outside of Tor.  This seems quite plausible, to me.
 - the investigation already had Ulbricht targeted, but without a
   smoking gun, and watched his SSH traffic using a standard wiretapping
   warrant.  This should have shown up in the arrest complaint if so.
 - a NSA/GCHQ capture was used to locate the server, and the public
   disclosure so far is an example of "parallel construction".
 - a vulnerability in the Tor network let the investigators find the
   server, possibly assisted by the investigators running some number of
   Tor relays.
 - the IP was known to any of the several criminal elements known to be
   interested in Silk Road, and the investigators got it as part of a
   deal (to drop another investigation, or harass someone's enemy, or
   similar).
Given the shoddy quality of the rest of Ulbricht's security posture, I
strongly suspect that a "phone home" vuln in the SR server was the
trigger.  "Never trust anyone who's programming language of choice is

It seems that rnd_wavein uses a small window (you document 256 samples
as the default).  One common silent-failure mode of video capture
interfaces is to intermittently provide the same frame (around 1 MiB of
data) twice!

I'm not at all sure "uniquely insensitive to tampering" is true against
an attacker who can influence the RNGs physical environment.  Suppose you're
timing alpha particles, using a clock accurate to microseconds, and the
attacker puts a microgram of 210-Polonium a few centimeters from your
detector; you'll have an event to measure every microsecond and your
detector saturates, resulting in an unending stream of 1s.
A similar attack (saturating a detector which is supposed to be secure
based on a "physical principle") defeats some "quantum key distribution"
systems (which seem to be snake oil for the most part); for example,
Certainly it's possible to add complexity to the system to ensure that
"everything is as it should be" and "nothing odd is going on"; this
complexity negates the putatively "simple" nature of systems that are

@_subject: what has the NSA broken? 
Tinfoil hat time ...
With today's disclosures, the question turns to -- what has the NSA
broken?  Unfortunately the journalists bowed to pressure from the
espionage-industrial complex and decided not to publish specific
details of what's broken; and the Snowden documents don't include all
the compartmentalized details anyways.  So all we can do is speculate
based on what is already known and the high level overview provided.
I don't believe that NSA has a complete AES break.  Call me foolish if
you must, but it's just not consistent with what we know so far.  I
believe that a correctly implemented, truly randomly keyed AES-256-CBC
or -CTR cipher is robust against cryptanalysis.  It seems just barely
possible that AES-128 has a complete break, since I suspect NSA can do
2^80 work on 2^60 bytes if it gives them decrypts of all the AES-128
they can sniff.
However, virtually nobody properly keys their ciphers with physical
entropy.  I suspect that correlated key PRNG attacks are almost
certainly a significant part of the NSA/GCHQ crypto break.  Many
deployed systems expose a significant amount of correlated output of
and serveral TFLOPs of built-to-spec supercomputers [1], this seems like
an obvious place for a hidden advance.
Also, retrieving key material from endpoints is a high return activity.
Nearly nobody uses PFS ciphersuites, many HTTPS privatekeys are used for
multiple years, and a single 1 KiB leak of key material is sufficient to
decrypt all traffic under that key.  (You don't even need the whole key,
just half the bits are plenty to reconstruct RSA keys using attacks in
the open literature.)  Insiders copying privatekey files after hours,
DRAM remanence after "hardware failure" in SSL offload boxes, bugdoors
leaking key bits in subtly biased entropy from crypto accelerator
hardware, on-disk encrypted keys decrypted due to low entropy
passphrases, etc.  Any key stored on a US-based VPS is obviously
compromised.  (Doubly so if your VPS is linode.)  Radio emissions from
colocated boxes are a nearly completely unexplored area of research.
Server-class IPMI baseboard coprocesssors have undisclosed access to
host RAM at runtime, and often unaudited access via provider
management-plane Ethernets.  If I had to get the keys out deniably, I'd
be scanning RAM for high entropy key schedules and leaking key bits in
the timing of heartbeat messages.
It seems fairly likely that NSA is at least a decade ahead of academic
RSA factoring.  I've heard second-hand stories of $10M machines of
custom ASICs built to attack RSA before 2005, and third-hand stories of
machines far weirder than that.  RSA-1024 I'd treat as dead, RSA-2048 is
probably robust enough that if NSA have an attack it would be too
valuable to risk exposing under anything but an existential threat
Non-AES legacy/proprietary ciphers are probably toast.  People switching
to RC4, stahp!  A5/2, lulz.  Maybe GOST and twofish and Salsa20 are
secure; I've met djb and all my checks for NSA minders came up negative.

@_subject: [liberationtech] Random number generation being influenced - rumors 
I agree with some of your premises, but disagree with the conclusion you
seem to be drawing.
Yes, it's just a fear of uncertainty.  We do not have evidence, nor even
a claim based on knowledge, that HWRNG backdooring has occurred.
However, I claim that the fear is well founded and should be taken into
account by all threat models.
HWRNG is a nearly-uniquely difficult security problem to crack.  By
definition it is impossible to prove that a black-box HWRNG is safe.
This is different from the security properties of a blackbox AES or
MODMUL accelerator, which can be demonstrated to conform to a known
specification.  If your AES instructions don't do AES, then testing
against a software implementation will show it!  The AES logic unit
will have a hard time leaking the AES keybits since there's nowhere
nondeterministic to put them.  etc.
By contrast, a properly functioning HWRNG cannot be tested in a way that
distinguishes it from the output of a stream cipher seeded with a
backdoor key.  And there's no way to test the behavior of HWRNG on an
ongoing basis; even if you had a test to run, it might switch to "stream
cipher mode" under the covers.
This is not to say that RdRand is completely unusable.  Putting RdRand
entropy into a software pool implementation like /dev/urandom (or
preferably, a higher-assurance multipool design like Fortuna) is a cheap
way to prevent a putative backdoor from compromising your system state.
Now, there is a way that we can learn that a backdoor was included; if
someone does a tear-down of a HWRNG and finds circuitry that has no
purpose other than being a backdoor, that would be conclusive.  AFAIK
nobody has tried that experiment.
Weighing towards distrusting HWRNG we have the fact that NSA is reported
(yesterday) to have intentionally backdoored Dual_EC_DRBG, and to have
spent significant amounts of money to backdoor chip implementations,
with enough success that they brag about it in administrative summaries.
So, I put a lot of credence in distrusting HWRNG black box
implementations.  But unfortunately we need a lot more reliable entropy.
A fully open source, nothing up my sleeve hardware entropy source would
be a huge improvement.

That's the claimed design, yes.  I see no particular reason to believe
that the hardware in my server implements the design.  I can't even test
that the AES whitening does what it is documented to do, because Intel
refused to provide access to the prewhitened input.
Providing accessible "test points" (software interfaces to the innards
of the implementation, with documentation of expected behavior between
the components) would be the absolute minimum to provide believable
assurance of the absence of a backdoor.  Better would be documents from
Intel of how the chip is designed at the mask level, and a third party
mill-and-microphotograph of a retail chip showing that the shipped
implementation matches the design.
Intel will never go for that, of course, since their chip masks are
their jealously guarded IP.  Since they can't provide evidence of a lack
of a backdoor, any reasonably cautious user should avoid depending on
Intel's implementation.

@_subject: [tor-relays] Getting max bandwidth out of a relay 
There are three main sinks of CPU usage in a well-configured large Tor
1. doing AES and SHA.  This scales with the network bandwidth used.
2. doing Montgomery multiplication for circuit creation requests.
3. bookkeeping.
(4. kernel TCP overhead etc.)
Until the August botnet hit,  was the primary user of CPU on most
relays.  A single Xeon core can do about 150 MB/sec of AES, or with
AES-NI around 700 MB/sec.
With the vastly increased circuit creation load currently in progress,
 and  have become a larger problem.  The bookkeeping, in particular,
has grown significantly.  On noisetor right now, 17% of all CPU cycles
are being spent in a single bookkeeping routine,
circuit_unlink_all_from_channel, according to "perf top".
This increased circuit-create-and-destroy CPU load reduces the CPU
available to do useful AES, so as a result, currently many Tor relays
are showing increased CPU usage with decreased bandwidth usage.
You'll have trouble getting a single Xeon core to run much more than 300
Mbps even with AES-NI, even without the botnet increasing CPU load
without increasing throughput usage.  In the current state, with so much
extra bignum work and bookkeeping, a single daemon will have even more
trouble pushing much bandwidth.
Best practice for maximum bandwidth is to run one Tor daemon per
physical core, each on a distinct IP address.  Plan for each daemon to
push about 15 MByte/sec.  They can do more like 20 or 30, but planning
for lower leaves some headroom.
Your boxes, with 12 cores and 70 GB of RAM, are quite a bit overpowered
for running 500 Mbps of Tor.  If you ran a Tor daemon per core, you'd be
able to push around 2 Gbps of Tor traffic, easily.

I'm a significant proponent of open source, and the benefits you
enumerate here are definitely true.  Open source can be helpful in
reviewing code, in grokking developer intent, in providing a hash-chain
guarantee of code lineage, in providing change history and justification
when reviewing new releases of a previously audited program, and in
fostering positive engineering practices.
However --
Your "proprietary program" strawman is full of holes.
The intellectual labor of decompiling a program delivered as a binary is
not especially large compared to the labor required to do a thorough
systematic review.  Given IDA Pro and a non-obfuscated Win32 or Linux
app, people I trust say the decompilation process is on the order of
10%-20% of the total effort of a review.
Binary patches are not great by any means, but they are definitely a
feasible method of deploying fixes, and this method works and is well
tested in the real world.  Some kinds of deployments basically require
binary patching, no matter what the underlying source management
technology.  (The Linux Ksplice project provides one prominent example.)
Backdoors are an enormous problem for both open source and
binary-distribution codebases, and claiming that open source will save
you from backdoors ignores the reality of the situation.  Just to start,

So you want to target a HTTP session that you have high assurance

For targets who have a Google account, Google has helpfully assigned
cookies which associate the user's account with the HTTP stream.  These
cookies are initially established over https, but are linked to YouTube
cookies for unencrypted http so that YouTube can provide valuable
advertising services at lower cost than serving over HTTPS.
The general technique is flexible to any targeted vulnerable network
software, but to make my description more concrete, the Flash one is
very understandable.  The Flash plugin has hundreds of unpatched RCE
vulns.  The exploit for these vulns is generally a sequence of a few
hundred ActionScript bytecode instructions.  The YouTube webpage serves
a very standardized Flash .flv file which is nearly identical for every
video.  So as the QUANTUMINSERT vendor, you code up a module which takes
the .flv off the wire from the server, patches it to include the
exploit, and puts a new .flv on the wire to the user.  Then you wire
that up to an inline capture appliance which uses an FPGA running at
10GigE wire speed to match HTTP responses that contain the desired
cookie, and just wait for your target to desire a fuzzy kitten video.
I don't know any details of any fielded systems, so the following is
just my description of a sensible way to build this product.  (I have
some experience building products with these technologies.)
The injection is extremely low level, at the Ethernet frame processing
layer.  The FPGA has the responsibility of running at line rate and
forwarding all frames except those belonging to a stream marked as a
When the regex engine running in the FPGA sees the Cookie: header of the

At the higher layer, QUANTUMINSERT wants to keep youtube.com happy, so

it just arrived 150 milliseconds later than expected (due to the
QUANTUMINSERT flv editing software).  From the point of view of the

of the Mukhabarat, they've got a backdoor into the PC of another
dangerous twitter user.
(OK the Bahraini Mukhabarat don't use QUANTUMINSERT, they are a Hacking
Team customer.  Same difference.)
Any specific attack is platform+browser dependent, but the general
technique works everywhere where you have 0day RCE vulns.  (ie
everywhere.)  Browser and OS vulnerability mitigation techniques like
ASLR and (especially) sandboxing highly vulnerable components like Flash
can help enormously by raising the complexity of exploits, by reducing
the supply of known+weaponized 0day, and by requiring more complicated

My mitigation would be to make auditing a default-deny rule, rather than
a default-allow.
Security auditing needs to be a holistic analysis, starting by
re-engaging with the requirements, verifying that the design is a
sensible and minimal approach to addressing the requirements, and
verifying that the implementation is a sensible, safe, auditable,
version controlled, approach to the design.
If the auditor at any point says "Well, I wouldn't have *recommended*
that you implement your JSON parsing in ad-hoc C with pointer arithmetic
and poor and misleading comments, but I can't find any *bugs* so I guess
it must be OK" then that is an immediate fail.
This is the default deny: we default to assuming the system is insecure,
and any sign that this might be true results in a failure.
Versus the current auditing method of default-allow: we run the audit,
and if no *concrete* exploits or bugs are found before the auditors run
out of time, then we trumpet that the system "has passed its audit".
Only if the design is sane, the implementation is sane, the development
team is following best practices and defensive coding strategies, with a

commit logs signed and committed to W/O media) in a development

I strongly disagree.  There are implementations that are Just Too
Complicated and are Impossible To Audit.  Such implementation choices
*do*, empirically, provide cover for bugs; and as we as a society build
more and more software into the fabric of our life-critical systems it's
imperative that "the implementor liked this complexity and refuses to
change it" gives way to the larger goals at stake.  The auditor
absolutely must have leeway to say "no you don't get to write your own
string processing, you are going to use the standard ones."
This kind of feedback is precisely what happens in the higher quality
audits that are becoming standard practice for security-critical
As a satisifed iSec customer (at a previous job), I have a bit of
insight here.  iSec is a leader in this space and definitely leads by
example.  Across the industry, the average quality of discourse in the
source auditing business is pretty good in my experience; only the
bottom-skimming truly awful auditors reduce their customer-facing
feedback to just a binary pass/fail.
However, inevitably, in the societal analysis of software quality for
practical purposes, reductive reasoning happens.  (This is not a bad
thing, it's absolutely necessary -- we humans don't have the cognitive
capacity to hold a complete decision tree in our head while doing this
reasoning.)  Thus statements like "you should use $OSS_CRYPTO_PACKAGE,
it has passed its audits" end up playing a role in the discourse.
We as domain experts have an obligation to ensure that our contribution
is given appropriate weight in the debate and decisions -- in both
directions.  For example if an auditor sees their results being
mis-interpreted in customer marketing material or media coverage, the
auditor has a moral obligation to correct that and insist that the
mischaracterization stop.  (And yes, I believe that this moral
obligation would override an NDA between the customer and the auditor;

many of the OMG WTF bugs and design flaws that have plagued other disk
encryption systems (looking at you, ecryptfs).

ecryptfs is a complete joke.  It intentionally does not encrypt *ANY*
metadata execpt the filename, leaking modification times, filesizes
(rounded to the block), write patterns, file ownership, permissions,
etc.  Because it's design is such a joke, it hasn't gotten any serious
crypto review, so I'd be surprised if it doesn't have critical
implementation bugs in the parts that aren't broken by design.
Please don't use ecryptfs.  It's not even better than nothing.

Not meaningless, although of course open source would be preferable from
a trustability standpoint.  I've got the executable code for the
proprietary WhatsApp apk installed on my phone, and can reverse engineer
it if I so choose.  (I'm running CM11 so extracting the APKs is fairly
straightforward.)  I also have automatic app updates turned off, so I
know when the code is supposed to change.
Of course it would be Best (TM) if everyone could use a completely
free operating system and had complete freedom to inspect all the code
we depend on.  But given the world we live in, 600M users with access to
E2E encrypted messaging is better than 600M users without such access.

Have you heard of the phrase "harm reduction"?  You can't solve a
social/technical problem by insisting that only perfect solutions are
acceptable.  You must provide incremental solutions that can be part of
a broad based move from the horrible place where we are now, towards a
more safe future.
I mean, *you* can do whatever you want, but users are going to ignore
solutions that don't connect to where they are today.  "Incremental
steps with continuous improvement" is a model for advice that actually
works in improving outcomes for real populations.  "Burn everything to
the ground and start over" is a model for advice that lets activists
maintain ideological purity without dirtying their hands with actual
people's actual problems.

Agreed on the first point, disagree on the second.  Any system that
claims to be secure will attract uses that are inappropriate to its
assumptions.  Documentation is not enough to dissuade this.
A colleague and I, both interested in modern cryptographic systems,
started to collaborate on a new project, using Pond.  Months later, we
realized that we had communicated useful information early on, over Pond
exclusively, and the "social norm that communications are deleted after
a few days" resulted in us losing important notes about the early days
of our project.
Even though it was clearly documented and I had simultaneously advocated
Pond to other experimental users for exactly this feature, I didn't
think through the consequences of this design feature for my use case.
I didn't even realize that I *had* a use case, until much later.
For this scenario, it turns out we wanted a modern secure communication
system more like Prate,  .  Except
perhaps with email-sized-message semantics rather than chat semantics
(or email in addition to chat?).
Generalizing from this specific example, you can find many other
examples of a security system being used outside of its designed
ssh is widely used for login to ephemeral hosts, reducing
TOFU to single session duration.
ssh is used with github as merely a bidirectionally-key-authenticated
transport layer ("git clone git at github.com:kragen/prate") rather than
its original remote shell purpose.
HTTPS x509 DV certificates have the mostly verstigal x.500 (iirc?)
Location/organization/etc naming support, the CN/sAN fields being nearly
the only operative ones.
HTTPS virtually never uses the many varied client authentication
mechanisms supported in TLS (client certificates, SRP, etc), instead
Rails and the many other web-app frameworks implement user
authentication over the top using passwords and cookies etc.

You know, the people who are involved in these stories are actually
humans, with real lives, families, and friendships.  If you watched
CITIZENFOUR without realizing that, I am terribly sorry for your
inability to releate to others on a human level, and I'd recommend that
you talk to someone with a more mainstream level of emotional
intelligence about these issues.
While Snowden is the object of significant official pressure, the rule
of law is still respected at least occasionally in the USA, and Lindsay
is not accused of any crimes.  There's no reason to suppose that she
would be prevented by USG from traveling, and any such restriction would
be front-page news.  (I'm not disputing that surreptitious tracking of
her and others is quite likely to be occurring, of course!)
Your insinuation that Snowden could not have had a girlfriend before his
trip to Hong Kong is baffling and inexplicable; he was leading a
perfectly normal life for someone in his position.  Both social and
economic documentation of their relationship exists.
(And your bringing up of her hobbies in this context seems to betray a
kind of naiive mistrust on your part; a majority of my friends who are
atheletic and in the 25-35 age bracket have tried out pole or other
circus arts.  It's fun!)

Plenty of sites switched *to* RC4 during the BEAST attack mitigation.
Some may not have switched back.

Note that the BEAST mitigation consists of moving RC4 to the front of
the list.  RC4 was always a valid option on most server implementations.
So if you're "checking for RC4" by looking at the preference list,
you're overcounting.  Instead you need to look at what the existing
client implementations will choose when connecting to the given server
preference list.

I contest this claim.  BRCM SoCs are probably not the *worst* SoCs in
the market (that distinction probably belongs to Mediatek or a chinese
vendor we've never heard of) but they are almost certainly not in the
first ranks.
Unfortunately I can't make a strong argument as to which SoCs are in the
first rank.  I'd give some of the TI chips a higher chance, but
brand-hunting is not the route to safety -- some of the TI chips are
almost certainly as bad or worse.
I am concerned about the following --
1. existing SoCs CPUs certainly have errata (known errors or
undocumented "features") that are not disclosed to the public, and never
fixed in patched chip releases.  Some of these are likely to cause
security issues.  Previous SoCs (circa 2008) have had undisclosed bugs
in instruction decode allowing privilege elevation, for example.  Even
Intel and AMD, who have a *much* larger team working on these systems
than places like Broadcom and Mediatek, still manage to ship security
bugs from time to time... I don't give BRCM much of a chance of shipping
bug-free silicon.
2. SoCs contain a multitude of "Intellectual Property Blocks" such as a
DRAM controller, an Ethernet controller, USB, SATA, AC97 Audio, etc.
These are all connected together by an interconnect bus.  Each block
comes from a different development group, often purchased from a
different company.  The company that sells you the SoC often doesn't
even know what the features and bugs of their purchased IP cores
*are*... and that undocumented ethernet core may well have a "feature"
that would allow arbitrary access to the interconnect.
3. SoC interconnects don't have much in the way of security.  When the
Ethernet controller bug lets a Evil Packet onto the interconnect, it's
probably just a hop skip and a jump to main memory.

References: The privaTegrity (PT) backdoor is significantly more malignant than the
Tor dirauth issue.
If you pwn the Tor dirauths, you can sign and publish a false
"consensns" to clients that will cause them to use only your relays for
new connections, thus breaking anonymity for new connections.  Doing so
leaves a trail of bits showing that this was done (mostly just on the
target system).  Tor is actively seeking solutions to make their system
more privacy-preserving and if a better option shows up in research,
they will likely adopt it.
If you pwn the PT overlords, you can retrospectively deanonymize
connections that you recorded in the past.  If PT were deployed at scale
with a, say, 12-month deanonymization window [1] then every connection
during that interval would be silently deanonymized by APT0 who has
stealthily exfiltrated the overlord private material.
[1] the whole point of the PT backdoor and its claim to "break the
    crypto war stalemate" is that a lawful investigation could go back
    and ask "who sent this bomb threat".
If PT were deployed at scale and a vulnerability were found that used
the backdoor, the developers are left with an uncomfortable choice --
fix the vuln and thereby break the backdoor, or leave users vulnerable
and preserve the so-called "lawful" access?  This is not a conflict that
I want my privacy technologists to have to navigate.
Now, cMix seems like an interesting technology (much like the tech bits
of eCash were interesting back in the 90s, a previous   I
chatted with one of the coauthors yesterday and there's clearly an
interesting performance improvement to existing mix networks; read the
paper[2] for more details.  But the PT system built on it is predicated
on an unrealistic model of datacenter security, international
geopolitics, network economics, cyberwar, and network reliability.
