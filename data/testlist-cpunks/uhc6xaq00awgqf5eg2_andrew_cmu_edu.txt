@_subject: Apology to Graham Toal & Cypherpunks 
I'd like to apologize for stating that the post made by Graham Toal
 was a forgery.  It has now come to my
attention that it was not.
Graham Toal had always posted from  until today,
when he suddenly posted from: "gtoal at gtoal.com"
, talking about a racist post by TC May that
I had never seen, and asking to be removed from the list.  Naturally, I
got suspicious.
I still don't know what's going on with the email address switching, but
I guess the recent events on cypherpunks have made me a bit overly
paranoid.  Hopefully, I haven't made a complete fool out of myself over
this misunderstanding.
I guess we have another good reason to sign with PGP...
