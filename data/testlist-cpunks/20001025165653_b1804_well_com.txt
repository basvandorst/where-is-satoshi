The problem with act utilitarianism is that in whatever form it takes it leaves itself much to open to the problems of personal view point. Hitler felt himself completely justified in murdering all the jews because he felt they were causing an enormous amount of pain to the rest of the population. He would have been justified under your framework IF it could be shown they were causing sufficient pain, although that would necessarily be enormous amount of pain.
This is a problem with any formulation of act utilitarianism.  Any formulation of act utilitarianism inherently falls victim to a set of extreme circumstances that result in outcomes which are clearly immoral (see the Hitler example above for a counter example).  That's why I'm not an act utilitarianist....
