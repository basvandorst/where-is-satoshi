@_subject: Attacking Clipper with timing info? 
Remember those carefully-chosen S-box numbers for DES and how, years later,
how they just happened to turn out to be optimal for defending against the
newly-discovered (in non-military circles) technique of differential
cryptanalysis... :-)

@_subject: Is Dr Fred Cohen a Loon??? 
In that case, look at the last two pages in "Applied Crypto - 2nd ed", where
Wiley puts ads for related books.  You'll find:
- "E-Mail Security", also by Bruce Schneier
- "Protection and Security on the Information Superhighway", by Frederick B.
- "Digital Money", by Daniel Lynch and Leslie Lundquist
I am neither attacking nor defending Fred Cohen; I don't know him from Adam,
and haven't read his messages or his book.  But since you asked for where
you can find Cohen's published work, there's one answer (assuming it's the
same Fred Cohen).

@_subject: Answer: Windows Eudora and PGP 
Run, don't walk, to check out:
Qualcomm's own Eudora support team recommended it, and it works seamlessly.
To use it with Eudora, important point: after installing WPGP, go into
Options|Select Keystrokes and  make sure "Use Capture mode" and "Use Select
All" are selected (and "Use Memorizer" should -not- be selected), otherwise
you'll get errors about 'no selected text'.  That's it; you're up and running.
Example of using WPGP: After writing your message as usual in Eudora, to
encrypt simply click on WPGP's "Enc" button and then click on the window
containing your message; that's it, very slick.  Another example: If you get
a PGP-encrypted email and want to reply, just hit Eudora's Reply as usual
(this will ">"-quote the entire original email as usual including the PGP
block), click on WPGP to "Dec"rypt, and click anywhere on your reply
window... it will pick out the PGP block, decrypt it, inform you about valid
signatures etc., and automatically paste the reply back into your window in
the proper place WITH PLAINTEXT PROPERLY QUOTED, as if you'd got the message
straight in the clear and hit 'Reply'.
Highly recommended.

@_subject: The Lotus Position 
On Friday morning, Whit Diffie took five minutes to announce a report that
he and other big names (including Rivest, Wiener, etc.) produced a week or
two ago in Chicago.  The subject of the report was recommended minimum
symmetric key lengths... the paper should be published at (Whit threatened them if they didn't get it up by Monday morning, but the
BSA site currently just says that they'll add a pointer to the report within
the next week).
To avoid keeping everyone in suspense, here's the basic result Diffie
announced: the world's leading cryptographers (outside the walls of the NSA)
agree that 75-bit keys are the minimum (I think this was for protecting
commercial communications).  To build in time-sensitivity, add one bit per
year... i.e. if the information needs to be kept secret for 20 years, use at
least 95 bits.
That said, talk to the NSA about 40-bit keys -- and to Lotus about its max.
64-bit keys, for that matter!  When he made the announcement on Wednesday
morning, Ray Ozzie (of Notes fame) knew he might get flak about keeping
Notes at 64 bits, so as soon as he mentioned it he added a phrase something
like (going from memory) 'but let's leave aside for now the question about
whether 64 bits is enough.'  Interesting comment in light of Diffie et al's
answer announced two days later. :-/
In answer to a question from the floor, Ozzie did say that yes, the
agreement reached with the NSA was scalable -- IOW, that you could use
128-bit keys and give the government 88 of them, instead of 64-and-give-24

@_subject: Blacknet & Lotus Notes 
I think people are missing the point... even if we assume the absolute worst
case, that the private key is broken and becomes publicly available,
international Notes users are no worse off than before.
That said, it shouldn't happen soon.  One of the things Ray said in his
announcement was that the government agreed to both generate and then guard
this key with the same diligence with which they guard their most important
secrets (he specifically mentioned nuclear missile controls).  While it
makes for a nice sound bite, I'm comfortable that there's probably also a
lot of truth to it.

Careful... what would YOU have done, with your customers demanding stronger
crypto today and you unable to legally give it to them?
Again, folks, try to remember that this is NOT key escrow... international
Notes customers are no worse off than before, and a darn sight better off
against everyone besides Uncle Sam.

@_subject: Let's *NOT* "Raise their Awareness" 
Gee, that's funny.  I grew up in a household where we always spoke only
German, and not only that but I had to write one page of German daily to
keep my writing skills up; I was fluent in it at three.  I grew up in a
neighbourhood where we always spoke English; I was fluent in it at four.  I
grew up in a school system that offered me French immersion for about six
years, so for several years most of my classes were in French only; I was
fluent in it at fifteen.  I now speak and write all three languages (though
I'm most fluent in English and the French is rusty).  I was born in Canada
and have lived here all my life; I don't see the problem.
PMFJI the middle of this, but assuming the above account wasn't taken out of
context it seems awfully ludicrous to me.  Just MHO, of course.  I've never
yet seen a child who can't pick up a language common in the area just by
being around people who speak it... especially if it's the language used and
taught in school!  I have friends who've come from countries in Africa where
there are many tribal groups in addition to the widely-used official French
and English languages, and I was impressed when I saw these teenagers come
over here already fluent in five or six languages... until I was told that's
normal where they come from and everyone knows at least four just to get
around from day to day.  It boggles the mind to think that speaking one
language at home exclusively would have any sort of impact on a child's
development, AFAICS.
To state a REALLY controversial opinion: I've always felt one reason many
kids are so bored with school is that our school systems just plain don't
challenge them, and I'm afraid I see the above as a perfect example of
swaddling and coddling.  Kids are amazing and are guaranteed to surprise
you, when someone takes the time to work with them and set them achievable
If you'll excuse a European joke: "Q: What does a European call someone who
speaks four languages?  A: Gifted.  Q: Three languages?  A: Bright.  Q: Two
languages?  A: Normal.  Q: One language?  A: American." :-)  (No, this isn't
a snub, it's just meant in good humour; it applies to a lot of us Canucks
too even though we do have two official languages.  Heck, I apply it to
myself; my French is rusty, I haven't used it in over 12 years.)

@_subject: Why Americans feel no compulsion to learn foreign languages 
Hold on, hold on... :-)  As the first to post along that line, may I
reiterate I'm in no way "anti-American"?  It's just that some Americans (and
some Canadians, and especially some Englishmen) do have a reputation in the
world for going places and expecting the natives to speak their language.
It gets interpreted as arrogance, sometimes unjustly.  Hence some of the jokes.
Funny thing: I rarely hear someone who does know another language argue that
it's not desirable and beneficial; only among the unilingual do I regularly
find such strong feelings.  As a wise man once said (sorry, source unknown):
"If you do not know another language, you do not know your own."  There's a
lot of truth to that... I never knew English as well as I do now before I
learned French, and German in particular helped immensely.  Fact is, once
you know a couple of languages in that group, the others (e.g., Italian,
Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, Swedish) are relatively easy to pick up because
now you start seeing the underlying patterns -- that in itself being a big
part of knowing your own language better.
Or, as a more contemporary souce (I ) would put it: "Speaking with only
one language is like seeing with only one eye."  But try to explain colour
to a blind man... :-/
I agree; I haven't used French practically at all in over 12 years.
However, had I never learned it, I would have been diminished (and, worse,
never known my ignorance).  A language is not just about word-communication;
it is about thought, expression, and especially point of view.  There are
things you can say in English that you could never say the same way in
German, and vice versa; which means that there are ideas and viewpoints you
could never fully appreciate without another language.  If some folks feel
this is unnecessary, well, they can get through life quite well with just
one tongue... that's their decision.
Anyway, apologies for starting this tangent here, since its crypto relevance
is zero or less. :-)  I only wanted to express why the word "compulsion" in
this thread's new title already speaks volumes to me, and to help explain
why this sort of thing sounds to outsiders like another form of isolationism
(not that many countries haven't been getting accused of that recently,
particularly in the East; it's not just a Western thing).
