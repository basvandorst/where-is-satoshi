@_subject: Human scum in the crypto/security industry industry 
lots of Human scum, snake oil peddlers etc in my industry,
back at Sunsoft in 1994 I used to have to work with
 as he was writing the initial
versions of Firewall-1(was being done on Solaris 2.4 at the time).
He had a desk in Bldg 5 at Sunsoft also
Gil as Wikipedia states( and as
Bamford writes was a member of the Mossad linked Unit 8200.  He was
extremely eager to get FW-1(which Sun had NO source to at that time)
into the hands of Sun Customers.. LOTS of SUN customers.
And given what I was doing at the time for the 5 Sun Companies, I was a
Sun Industrial Relations 'skunk' as in skunkworks there was a bit of
pressure for me to use Fw-1 at my offsite lab(s) and my home lab(NOT), I
already had alternatives.
Fortunately as I was also working with SunLabs we had internally
developed alternatives which we did control all sources for
ie Sunscreen-1, unfortunately there was an insistance we use BSAFE(which
I ALWAYS had a LOT of resistance to) for the SKIP crypto tunnels, as we
are coming to find out..  there were evil reasons for this. Skip had
some internal defenses against such skulduggery such as rapidly
switching out keys.. use of DH.. and both Ashar Aziz and Whit Diffie had
their hand in the design. But if there were flaws in the random number
gen that were not known to us then this puts a whole different light on
things like none of the defenses mean anything when keys were predictable.
     and I used to think John Young had finally skipped over the edge

Well Kids,
    the RSA Conference is coming to the Bay area yet again,
So far F-secure is worthy of Honor they have chosen to boycott the
conference, as EVERY HONEST security and crypto firm/personnel should
 do.. the next few months will tell both us and the public who we can

Bravo to F-Secure and  Mikko Hypponen, the beginning of Honest security
consulting firms..
 his reason quoted below
“I don’t really expect your multibillion dollar company or your
multimillion dollar conference to suffer as a result of your deals with
the NSA. In fact, I'm not expecting other conference speakers to cancel.
Most of your speakers are american anyway – why would they care about
surveillance that’s not targeted at them but at non-americans.
Surveillance operations from the US intelligence agencies are targeted
at foreigners. However I’m a foreigner. And I’m withdrawing my support
from your event.”

So for those of us using the Lower cost tier of SSL cert provider(s) are
definitely hosed at this point(but I figured the NSA had an intermediate
CA in the browser chain someplace,and this is getting to be an old story
and with that Intermediate CA allowed to sign wildcard and same name
certs(in fact with the intermediate CA cert in possession this can be
done on the fly with certain equipment) even private keys correctly
handled(locally generated) fall in the face of this kind of attack. Now
of course I am wondering for folks who knew this and then used the
onsite generator for private key gen as opposed to locally generated
keya via openssl simply had the private key copied off to NSA under the
authority of an NSL.(and given the above scenarios of a MITM cert
generating Intermediate CA does it even matter which way you get fucked?).
      startssl and cheapssl both being US based means a LOT of folks and
 firefox has a browser plugin to detect changes in the server cert BUT
if all looks plausible MOST of us will click right on through(the SSL
infrastructure and governance being hopelessly broken from any rational

Doesnt Surprise me,
    During the original publication cycle of PGP an effort was made to
reach out to mitch kapor and john perry barlow for aid from EFF but Jim
Bidsoz was already there with his lies that PGP was stolen/purloined
code and thus mitch/perry washed his hands of PGP. FUCK THEM..
FUCK MITCH KAPOR, FUCK JOHN PERRY BARLOW!!
and yes this list and so called movement(HAH!) was founded on Media
Manipulation/Braggarts/BS if you will) of the highest order, It even got
a greater push after we viewed an Inforwar Con V  presentation  in 1994
 called Red Teaming(it was an information attack on the structures of
the press(propaganda with a twist)).
And given Internet Sockpuppets :) its remarkably easy to be ones one
greek Chorus(and press army)..  in fact Anonymous vs the rootkit.com
founder was over "greek chorus" type of sockpuppet software that the
firm was developing , and while javascript turing scripts did pose
initial problems for same(sockpuppet software) when facebook and others
tried implementing them, call outs to the "mechnical turk" and later to
the Selenium plugin nowadays for the amateur efforts quickly solved that
technical issue.
Anonymous remailers have also been remarkably effective in hoodwinking
both the press corp and the public and even members of this list
 to swallow both the malware nostrums(mcafee and others)(hook) and later
PGP/other crypto/security crap (line and sinker).
This kind treatment of the truth was drove our first list foil Detweiler
stark raving bonkers and sent him raving on the list about tentacles of
MEDUSA especially after list participants picked up and started remailer
bombing him with a procmail script that someone thoughtfully published
to the list that would email him several (n+1)slightly different copies
of his own posted mail each time he posted.
Detweilers final demise from his position as one of the privileged
Sysadmins at the University when he carelessly replied to a type one
remailer block that contained his direct supervisors spouse's(wife)
email address among others(the chancellors of the university  email
addresses were included in that block.) thinking that he was instead
replying to one of his sockpuppet harassers(I believe it was tentacle
 who copped to this).
Badda bing Badda boom,, all 83 email addresses he had been abusing from
the university  position where he was employed were gone in 1 hour
etc...as was his job and privileged position from where he abused the
rest of the list.
David Sternlight was made of much stronger stuff :) ... Lance Detweiler
was MUCH more careless and thought he was one of the rulers of us..

Hello, I have been hearing some rumors about the cypherpunks
being `penetrated' by some spies and areas of the Internet
(mailing lists, newsgroups, private mail, journal articles, etc.)
being targeted with `tentacle' infiltrations. I thought this was
kind of fascinating to contemplate how they would behave. It
seems to me that loyalty is very hard to judge by mere email
messages alone, and that these hypothetical spies might take that
to their advantage. Here are some of the things that either
cypherpunk loyalists (cyberanarchists) or cy{b,ph}erwonk spies
might say to gain credibility and further `intelligence' from
- L.Detweiler is insane, has sent death threats, is behind
S.Boxx, is involved in cyberspatial guerrila warfare, is the
mastermind of a spy plot, etc. He is the only person in the world
who cares about pseudospoofing. (All the complete ad hominem
fantasy stuff).
- `T.C. May and E.Hughes and J.Gilmore are all outstanding and
upstanding net citizens, have never pseudospoofed or done
anything wrong, and are the target of an anonymous smear campaign
by terrorists.'
- `I have been to cypherpunk meetings and parties, and I have met
all the people who have been accused of being tentacles, and they
are all real. In fact, I saw their drivers licenses.' `Someone
accused of being a tentacle actually lives with me.'
- There are no conspiracies whatsoever going on inside the
cypherpunks, including drug use by `leaders' or pseudospoofing or
other illegitimate activities.
-  Lies are liberating. `We have a right to lie to the media and
other people through tentacles.' One can make a game out of
infecting respectable media outlets like Wired and NYT with
elaborate deceptions.
- Pseudospoofing is liberating. `You are only as good as the
number of identities you can project on the internet; this is a
feature, not a bug.' The Enders Game book (Orson Scott Card?) is
an example of the liberating effect of pseudospoofing on freeing
people from their arbitrary prejudices about human identity and
- There's no big deal about black marketeering or tax evasion.
Everyone does it. It's a survival tactic in a brutal world of
corrupt governments and massive corporations out to oppress the
little guy. We are entering a New World Order where anarchy will
rule and all governments will crumble.
- Blacknet is a harmless and visionary cyberspatial experiment
done by T.C.May.
- `Please take these annoying discussions about secret
conspiracies elsewhere.'
Of course, if any of these statements are by the spies, they are
just trying to build up your trust so that they can betray you
later when they have the proper opportunity. Or, sometimes, there
is the dictum that `intelligence is more valuable than
liquidation' and they may continue to deceive you just for the
valuable intelligence indefinately.
* * *
Then there may be some `tentacles' out there that are being
driven by the counterrevolutionaries bent on destroying the
Cyberanarchist movement and interested in getting some of their
own propaganda out there. These would be indistinguishable from
cy{b,ph}erwonk loyalists.
- L.Detweiler is brilliant, has made stellar net contributions,
has never sent death threats, no evidence exists that he is
behind S.Boxx, he has spoken out against cyberspatial guerrila
warfare, is the mastermind of a new mailing list but talk of a
spy plot is preposterous, etc. He is one of many in the world who
cares very seriously about pseudospoofing as all his writing in
e.g. RISKS and CUD attests.
- `Very little is know about T.C. May and E.Hughes and J.Gilmore
as far as their personalities, and in fact J.Gilmore has admitted
publicly to drug use, and all vehemently resist making
unequivocal public or private statements on pseudospoofing,
although they do seem to be the target of an anonymous smear
campaign by the anonymous person S.Boxx, but with some disturbing
elements of truth.'
- `I have never been to cypherpunk meetings and parties, and I am
suspicious of the behavior of many of the `people' L.Detweiler
has accused of being tentacles, because of the lack of verifiable
information and a sort of `cardboard cutout' flavor to their
personalities. There seems to be some desperate damage control
going on.'
- There seem to be some actual conspiracies going on inside the
cypherpunks, including drug use by `leaders' or pseudospoofing or
other illegitimate activities.
-  Lies are lies. `No one has a right to lie to the media or
other people through tentacles.' Anyone who makes a game out of
infecting respectable media outlets like Wired and NYT with
elaborate deceptions is malicious, depraved, and perverted.
- Pseudospoofing is perverted. Statements like `You are only as
good as the number of identities you can project on the internet;
this is a feature, not a bug.' are depraved and deluded. The
Enders Game book (Orson Scott Card?) is an example of the very
dangerous effect of pseudospoofing on manipulating people in
their assumptions and presumptions about human identity and
accountability, and for mind control and brainwashing.
- Black marketeering and tax evasion are evil. Though many
promote it, it is toxic to social harmony. Those that promote it
are all hypocrites who claim that they have found new societies
that are free of it, but have found only societies of poisonous
distrust and paranoia. The whole purpose of governments and
corporations is to serve people, and if they fail to do so they
need to be adjusted but not destroyed.
- `Please don't censor these fascinating discussions about secret
conspiracies and cyberanarchists.'
* * *
It's quite a pity that in Cyberspace, to borrow a phrase that is
rapidly becoming a cliche, no one knows if you are a spy. Perhaps
we can work together to build systems that minimize this kind of
rampant paranoia. It's really a shame that someone with a grudge
against any mailing list or its leaders could so disrupt its
smooth flowing operation with no repercussions. I have some ideas
for preventing this, and in fact I encourage anyone else who does
to join the Cy{ph,b}erwonks list and discuss these issues
associated with Electronic Democracy.
``The first casualty in war is the truth.'' There is a saying in
war, `shoot them all and let God sort them out.' Perhaps in these
turbulent times, this message represents a `list all the rumors
and let the People sort them out.' I hope the truth prevails in
Cyberspace as it does in the real world. Our own controversies,
such as those above, will serve as an interesting experiment.

@_subject: Pretty Curved Privacy.. ECC Curve p25519 util(Bernstein approved 
Pretty Curved Privacy (pcp1) is a commandline utility which can be used
to encrypt files. pcp1 uses eliptc curve cryptography for encryption
(CURVE25519 by Dan J. Bernstein). While CURVE25519 is no worldwide
accepted standard it hasn't been compromised by the NSA - which might be
better, depending on your point of view.
Caution: since CURVE25519 is no accepted standard, pcp1 has to be
considered as experimental software. In fact, I wrote it just to learn
about the curve and see how it works.
Beside some differences it works like GNUPG. So, if you already know how
to use gpg, you'll feel almost home.
Lets say, Alicia and Bobby want to exchange encrypted messages. Here's
what the've got to do.
First, both have create a secret key:
 Alicia                             Bobby
 pcp1 -k                            pcp1 -k
After entering their name, email address and a passphrase to protect the
key, it will be stored in their vault file (by default ~/.pcpvault).
Now, both of them have to export the public key, which has to be
imported by the other one. With pcp you can export the public part of
your primary key, but the better solution is to export a derived public
key especially for the recipient:
 Alicia                             Bobby
 pcp1 -p -r Bobby -O alicia.pub     pcp1 -p -r Alicia -O bobby.pub
They've to exchange the public key somehow (which is not my problem at
the moment, use ssh, encrypted mail, whatever). Once exchanged, they
have to import it:
 Alicia                             Bobby
 pcp1 -P -I bobby.pub               pcp1 -P -I alicia.pub
They will see a response as this when done:
 key 0x29A323A2C295D391 added to .pcpvault.
Now, Alicia finally writes the secret message, encrypts it and sends it
to Bobby, who in turn decrypts it:
 Alicia                             Bobby
 echo "Love you, honey" > letter
 pcp1 -e -i 0x29A323A2C295D391 -I letter -O letter.z85
 cat letter.z85 | mail bobby at foo.bar
                                    pcp1 -d -I letter.z85 | less
And that's it.
Please note the big difference to GPG though: both Alicia AND Bobby have
to enter the passphrase for their secret key! That's the way CURVE25519
works: you encrypt a message using your secret key and the recipients
public key and the recipient does the opposite, he uses his secret key
and your public key to actually decrypt the message.
Oh - and if you're wondering why I named them Alicia and Bobby: I was
just sick of Alice and Bob. We're running NSA-free, so we're using other
sample names as well.
There are currently no packages available, so pcp has to be compiled
from source. Follow these steps:
First, you will need libsodium:
 git clone git://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium.git
 cd libsodium
 ./autogen.sh
 ./configure && make check
 sudo make install
 sudo ldconfig
 cd ..
Next, pcp:
 git clone git://github.com/tlinden/pcp.git
 cd pcp
 ./configure
 sudo make install
 cd ..
Optionally, you might run the unit tests:
 make test
To learn how to use pcp, read the manpage:
 man pcp1

And for now I will be testing pcp as I prefer conventionally compiled
and linked code for crypto I use in C/C++.
I will have to see about static linking for pcp :)
More Contenders for curve 25519 replacements to gnupg and openpgp crypto?
     All the best and Thanx for making us aware of PBP
     GH
ps can you see about compatibility testing PBP with enigmail/thunderbird?

Hi Stef,
it seems its gnupg command line options you would want to emulate.. pgp
left the command line abandoned sometime ago..:(

That seems to be a no for now.. I have been testing both and after some

I will have some observations later for the authors...

DJ Bernstein and Tanja Lange did a study on which ECC curves are safe to
implement and use, found at YMMV as per the snowden releases but for now curve p25514 appears to be
safe AND accessible in at least 2 cli type implementations.
To be avoided at present is SECCURE-0.4 and below(no safe curves as per
the bernstein document)

Hi Stef,
      Consider this an invitation to you and Tlinden to converge on file
formats and key representations in both implementation(s) if this is
technically possible.
It would give folks a choice at least.

    thats kind of an interesting read.. especially using the technique
of tagging the wallets with another easily recognizable amount to make
them easy to trace.
It would seem the the blockchain which protects against double spending
but is entirely public and unblinded(in a chaumian cryptographic
blinding sense) and the fact that one can unilaterally pay a particular
wallet a recognizable amount..
It would seem that one simple could leave that amount behind(since it is
EASY to identify and simply transfer the rest of the funds into ever
smaller wallets and exchange those face to face at buttonwood meetings etc
    formerly we used to classify an electronic anonymous currency
by saying "its good enough for assassination politics"..
   Bitcoin is not NEARLY good(safe) enough for AP... sorry

this might benefit from a technique such as golay encoding or other ECC

 for
radio telemetry from drones..)   it seems ok on longer runs of bytes but
gets frequent errors on shorter runs

@_subject: using Curve p25519 cryptography for type 2(Mixmaster) and type 
So it seems because we are using a decades old technology(email) that
another 2 decade old technology is still useful for anonymous dissent
where email based lists are concerned.
I am looking at resurrecting
mixmaster, mixminion and nym.alias.net nymserver designs from the
various code wastebaskets and retrofit them with some newer encryption
technology based on curve25519 and poly-1305 libsodium based algorithms
and routines.
Do these ideas sound interesting and viable to the coders on the list
and of course worthwhile? or are they best left to the trashbin of
history being mostly used by trolls and those damn pesky voices of dissent?

Actually except for map all inputs and outputs types of adversaries.. I
wont tend to agree with you.
Thing is as long as there are mailing lists  and email,
 remailers and nymservers will continues to be effective for personal
and political usage.
Just with rabbi(len sassman) dead(the last maintainer of the mixmaster
code) there is no one to champion same(mixmaster) or even those left
alive(nick matheson and few others(lucky,noise etc) who understand the
tech well enough to make competent changes. The type 2 remailer network
is still alive and working  and new code will attract new operators and
I plan the mods to support either old format or new format(once this is
designed) type 2 and type  especially in the face of the NSA
monitoring...if nothing else than as a "FUCK YOU" gesture...
The other problem is the by far and large disappearance of private email
servers where one can experiment without the upstream complaining..
mostly this is confined to university or to elderly  holdouts like moi
who actually own long term persistant servers and fund their operation
privately , comcast tries very hard to block port 25 and other email
ports to force one to use only their outgoing email servers
And again anonymous type 2 and hopefully type 3 remailers and nymservers
again are useful in politics and other skulduggery(outing politicians
etc) their safety or non safety depends on ones activities and ones
nah been there done that for past 24 years etc..
even was one of the first 2 "persons of interest" in the cypherpunks
anonymous remailers are much more fun and mischievous than helping one
handed morons view the latest porn at low latency.

Hi All,
Unfortunately there are NO guarantees of NSA proof claims,
Phil above all knows this after having designed version after version of
insecurity with pgp, bassomatic and web of evidence being only 2
examples that went public,(dont even get me started on the DSA key mess...)
Similar bumps in the road were noted during ZRTP development..
Now in the secure phone case .. there is NO way to know that you are
secure against NSA TAO even if ALL source code to the phone apps and the
base band processor firmware is published.. not even if the VHDL code
for the IC design is published..
does mean we stop trying and give up?? hell no...think of it as a
economic problem even classifying enough crypto at realtime speeds for
capture turns into a major pain the the ass even on Narus boxen.
And enough PFS-type systems ie DH ephemeral key exchange systems
deployed and the headache grows even more...
but all claims of NSA proof are indeed basically somewhat fraudulent as
its a guarantee that no one checked out the chip design software for
auto insert logic additions to their cell libraries. And with TAO
placing teams of engineers its almost a sure bet that the  IC libs are
contaminated either with active flaws or simply important ones that
never got reported. And etc ad nauseam from the silicon on out..
we should just stop using loaded language like "NSA Proof" and resting
on past laurels to assure folks that such is a fact(it isn't).
       gh(who is now finally picking up the python language in a serious
ps "Violent Python"(the book) rocks!
next will be taking pbp routines and formats and creating a new
curvep25519 version of type 1 and type 2 remailers with a nym.alias.net
clone in python using Curvep25519 keys to emulate a type 1 reply
block(have to see what mixminion does for reply-blocks if any)
ps2ps: PCP and PBP developers need to make up their collective heads
about external representation key formats for public keys(I will be
using pbp as its already in python) I am kind of dependent on these(key
format representations)
