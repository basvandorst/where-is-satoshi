     This makes little sense. There are a great many .22 pistols which
have external hammers or an sufficient safety. Why would you have to
rack a slide, other than when you first loaded. With most, if not all,
semi-auto handguns, you always carry a round in the chamber anyway, for
one, to be ready, for two because it's one more round.      Nobody, but nobody, walks around with an empty chamber, whatever
the caliber.

Hmmm, I'll bet it'd just spoil their day if that first round jammed
at the chamber mouth, eh? As .22's are want to do, especially the first
round, when the mag spring is at it's tightest and the slide not coming
quite full force. Sometimes a .22, being a soft lead bullet, jams
particularly hard and is a bitch to clear quickly.     But you already knew that, right?

Well, very low frequency could be used quite easily by almost anyone, in
fact, the simplest, cheapest, most portable transmitters would use VLF and
morse code. It's something any 10 year old kid could rig, and you get
excellent propagation all over the world. Hams use VLF around campfires just
for kicks.
And if you used it in burst mode with a pre-recorded tape or digital input of
an encrypted message sent in morse -- who knows?

I don't think I heard much of anything that hasn't been already discussed here. They ended it with someone talking about this whole idea (that the anthrax was being spread by
domestic groups, not al-quaida) being simply the result of the compartmentalization and bureaucratic nature of the FBI -- the departments whose bailiwick is investigating foreign
groups will just naturally push the idea that it's done by them, and likewise, the FBI departments who investigate domestic groups will try to push their trip. They all want the
glory and media attention, eh? And the whole thing ended up with a good bit of talk about how actually they have no clues or leads whatsoever in any direction or towards any group

On a long road trip one night, I heard an extremely interesting long
discussion amongst a group of psychiatrists, sociologists, and other
scientists,  regarding a study which showed, firstly, that large numbers of
attractive young women married unattractive, frequently older, boring, but
financially well-off men.
      No surprise, that, eh? But then, the study showed, that a large
percentage of these same women also tended to have adulterous relationships
with what was termed "dangerous" men -- losers, outlaws, reckless adventurers,
     Another surprise was that this was a cross-cultural phenomenon, and the
gist of the discussion was that this wasn't merely thrill seeking or whatever
on the part of the women, but was actually subconscious darwinism in action,
i.e., the woman formed the permanent alliance with the man who could best
support her offspring, then got herself impregnated by the males with the
strongest, sexiest, genetic makeup -- thereby insuring that not only would her
children survive, but they, like their true father (and also like the mother)
would be very attractive and likely to mate.
      An extremely interesting idea. Some might find the articles in the most
recent Wired about the high percentages of autism among Silicon Valley
children to be interesting --

<3C023C52.2ADD7495
     Kinko's got sued over selling the "student packets", there was a
big flap over it a few years ago in academia, but as I recall the end
result was that professors are more careful to have written permission
from the publishers in hand, and the packets are still being sold.
    Most publishers are cooperating -- it's simply that the material is
in the library, the portions of the books used is not large enough that
students would buy them anyway -- as opposed to actual "textbooks" that
they do purchase, so it seems a reasonable "fair use" compromise. In
most of these cases the publishers realizer that they aren't going to
sell more books by refusing, the authors realize that they'll get more
exposure, more recognition, and the students don't have to spend hours
in the library waiting for someone else to finish copying the materials.
    But as I said, most professors are being much more careful about
getting permission beforehand and most copy places are being more
careful about what they sell.
   At the biomedical library I worked at, the copiers only worked if you
had a special card, and only students and faculty had the cards, since
copying the medical texts and selling them to law firms and clinics
was/is a lucrative business and was a principal income for the library.
Don't know how the DMCA has affected them.

I can't remember what the exact deal was with Kinko (and they were the

careful. Here, in fact, Kinko totally moved out of the student/university
area, went off to suburbia, and I see no signs anymore at their new site
about student packets.
    Plenty of other, no-name copy shops to fill the gap.

        Not true at all. Biodiesel is being marketed in the US today at
competitive prices, and obviously, like anything else, economies of
scale would bring down that price. Ethanol is another one. Brazil run a
large portion of
it's vehicles on ethanol.
      Besides which, the true cost of gasoline at the pump would be
$10-15 @ gallon without all the gov't subsidies to the oil industry.

     No, it wasn't debunked at all -- no evidence was given, only
unsupported suppositions. If you only take one subsidy alone, the military
cost, oil has an absurd price, and that cost is rapidly going thru the roof.
     Biodiesel is a much better alternative than ethanol, but each has it's
place. All farming is subsidized at this point, biofuels have the potential
to make farming profitable again. Besides, as long as the oil industry has
even greater corporate welfae payments, why not? Speaking of program
subsidy, how about this:

Where do you get that from? Are you saying that farmers aren't growing
canola oil at a profit? Farmers are also growing corn and that corn is turned
into ethanol at a profit.

     No, it points out that they are not taxed at nearly as high a rate,
that's part of the subsidy.
     True - but most of their points are pretty damning. Let's get rid of all

I'll bet close to $10.

Of course you're ignoring the fact that sometimes the reason that they
are "starving on their own retched little plots of land." is because of NAFTA
and huge multinational corporations importing so much US factory farmed corn
and other ag products into that country that they can't compete. We've been
thru this discussion before.
      All else being equal, there is no logical reason in the world why they
should be "starving on their own retched little plots of land." Peasant farmers
have been making an adequate living on "their own retched little plots of
land." for at least since before any recorded history, and, for that matter,
can still do so.
      The average size farm in the world is only 7 acres, and if you talk to
most of those farmers, they would much rather live and work on their little
subsistence farms than move into a city and work in a factory. I myself lived
for many years on a very small farm and most definitely, as soon as humanly
possible, am going back to doing just that. Moving from your own piece of land
in the country being you own boss to living in a hovel in the city working as a
wageslave in a sweatshop for peanuts is not an improvement by any stretch of

farmers in the 3rd world who leave their land and go to work in sweatshops

What? You're talking nonsense here. Of course they make part of their living
selling crops --- what's all the bs about "forging his own metals" etc. Total straw
man arguement. The point was that they aren't "starving" for one thing, and, if it
were up to them, they'd stay put.
      Look, I'll try to explain it in terms that perhaps even a city boy like you
can understand. You don't have to go to the 3rd world, just go talk to small
american family farmers. There are thousands of them out there who simply don't care
that they aren't making lots of money -- the important thing is that they can keep
their farms and do their own thing. What's wrong with that?
      You know what destroyed the small family farm in this country? Education -- ag
schools and the county extension agent. Funded, for the most part, by large chemical
companies. The old story of the country bumpkin getting conned by the city-slicker
salesman. Kids went off to ag school, came home and told Dad to do things the
"modern" way, factory farming with modern chemicals -- sure, go into debt, buy all
those new tractors and fancy equipment and we'll be rich.
      And then, of course, that little trick the Fed Reserve and the banks pulled
back in the 70's with manipulating the economy so that rural land prices went thru
the roof, farmers who had been mortgage free for generations got duped into
borrowing money on their land to buy that fancy new equipment that the ag schools
and extension agents told them they needed, then bingo -- the Fed played some more
tricks, land values dropped back down, and a whole lot of farmers lost their land.
       Is that what you call free-market economics? I call it fascism -- state and
industry working in concert to whipsaw the masses and get more control over peoples
lives. People who were very free and independant are suddenly wage slaves in the
city because they listened to the "experts" from industry and government. And got
      I know one heck of a lot of people who much prefer living in rural "poverty"
to living in a city making big bucks. Although my wife and I have been making a
whole lot more money in recent years than we ever thought we would, and live in a
big fancy house in the city, we consider it a serious mistake. Money isn't
everything. We were one heck of a lot happier when we earned about $4000.00 a year.
We will soon rectify that. Why make a bunch money and feed the fascist machine?
     One of my favorite cartoons was one of Snuffy Smith and his wife --- she says
"Pa, the world is passing us by." Snuffy replies, "It sure better!"
Damn straight!
"Tune in, turn on, and drop out."  Now that's real free market economics.

The best example I can give is the Amish. They *don't* send their sons to ag
school (don't even educate them past 7th grade actually) and don't listen to the
extension agents, and make money with small, totally old fashioned, organic farms. No
tractors, horses to plow with -- and make enough that when each son gets married, they
buy him a farm with cash.
They don't do the factory farm trip, don't get look for gov't handouts (which is what
*all* the big, agri-biz farms do), and compete very well.

Sure, but for the most part, they did alright, else we would not be here.
     Not so -- only because of corporate welfare.
       That's the point I was trying to make -- they aren't being "starved"
out. And, as I pointed out previously with the Amish, it isn't that they are
not mechanized enough, or not big enough. So why are they losing their land and
moving to the city to become wageslaves for some megacorp?
      In the US, it's been the swindle worked on them by the chem salesmen, the
gov't, and the banks -- non of which the Amish have any truck with, so they do
okay. In Latin America we see them primarily being kicked off their land by
"paramilitarys" usually in the pay of big ranchers and/or megacorp argribiz,
and sometimes by the army. Maybe kicked off is too strong -- frightened off by
all the rapes and murders and beatings, or, with the army, "relocated" to make
them "safe" from the guerillas (and to stop them from feeding the guerillas).
Remember -- we participated in this in Viet Nam? Our troops moved the peasants
off becuase it was "Viet Cong" territory, into camps where they could be
controlled -- and incidently provide cheap labor for some industry or other.
    Often, when the peasant tries to return to his land, he finds that the
local courthouse has been burned and all the records of ownership lost. In Viet
Nam, I personally know troops who killed villagers when they returned from
relocation camps. Not the first time, not the second time, but the third time

Their point is be disconnected from any central control, for one thing.
It's independance, not a total rejection of modern ways. They'll ride in cars,
for instance, just not, for the most part, own them.
      And my main point was that they do very well financially, where most other
small family farms are going under.
       Well, what's wrong with that? If you have a phone line in your house, it
makes it easy to bug you, doesn't it. I lived without a phone for about 18
years, it's not difficult. At one point, in fact, the phone company, without
asking, ran a buried phone line to the quite rural house we lived in, knocked on
the door and asked if they could install a phone inside. I said no, and, as soon
as they left, dug up the phone line in a dozen places along the route, cutting
chunks out of it.
       No paranoia here.  8-)

       But getting back to the "war of some terrorism" --- their whole

for Amerika.

This actually happened to me long ago when I was running a sawmill. One day I
showed up with a truck load of white cedar which was getting me around $800 @
thousand board feet. The man says, "Sorry, we're getting red cedar trucked
down from Canada at $300."  Hmmm.
     Well, red cedar ain't the same as white cedar by a long shot, but joe
backyard builder hasn't a clue, he just looks at the price.
    Yeah, I adapted (sold the sawmill quick, for one thing), but I also had a
lot of other options. OTOH, it took few years to figure things out, and I'm
still not happy with the outcome. And I had a wife who could make good money.
   Lucky me. The thing is, mostly I'm seeing fatcat whiteboys sitting on

them to the hinterlands of Guatamala and see how well they adapt.

VW presents new synthetic fuel strategy
In the context of its fuel strategy released at the recent Frankfurt IAA Motor Show, Volkswagen sees SunFuel as a key step towards environmentally compatible mobility. The new fuel offers considerable potential for the optimisation of conventional engines. SunFuel is also suitable for use in fuel cell systems with reformers.
On this basis, it will be possible to fill up fuel cell vehicles with a fuel produced from renewable resources without developing costly new infrastructure of the type which would be needed for hydrogen SunFuel is a synthetic fuel produced from biomass by a regenerative process. Natural photosynthesis is used for fuel production. Plants develop biomass from atmospheric carbon dioxide with the aid of energy from the sun.
To a large extent, this biomass consists of carbon and hydrogen. In the first step of the SunFuel process, these major constituents of biomass are converted into synthesis gas (H2, CO, CO2). This is then transformed into hydrocarbons in a synthesis reactor and processed as required to produce the "designer" fuel.
SunFuel is an extremely high-grade fuel, free from sulphur and aromatics. As biomass binds carbon dioxide during growth, the process is neutral with regard to carbon dioxide production. A variety of different types of biomass can be used for the synthesis of the new On the one hand, fast-growing, sturdy, resilient plants such as sedge (Miscanthus), poplars or willows can be grown. On the other hand, waste products containing carbon and hydrogen, such as sewage sludge, plastics or household refuse, can also be processed.
SunFuel must not be confused with Biodiesel. While only rapeseed oil is used for Biodiesel production, the SunFuel process taps the energy contained in the entire plant.
The use of SunFuel is highly environmentally compatible. In contrast to fossil fuels such as oil or natural gas, no additional carbon dioxide is produced during the combustion of SunFuel. As it is free from sulphur and aromatics, the new fuel also ensures a significant reduction in all types of emissions normally measured, especially particulate matter.
According to Dr Ulrich Eichhorn, Head of Volkswagen Research, "SunFuel opens up additional new perspectives. To date, engine developers have been forced to work with the fuel qualities available. Now, synthetic fuels of a variety of types can be produced.
"Not only petrol or diesel fuels can be synthesized from biomass. A number of intermediate stages are also possible. On this basis, there could be further rapprochement between petrol and diesel technology. In this way, the benefits of a diesel engine, such as low consumption, could be further expanded and combined with the very low emissions of a petrol engine with three-way catalytic converter.
"The designer fuel can be mixed with conventional petrol or diesel without any problems. SunFuel could therefore be introduced in a gradual transition process.
"In order to produce SunFuel for all the diesel-engined vehicles in Germany, it would be necessary to plant about 20 000 square kilometres. Currently, this area is certainly not available. However, the area of agricultural set-aside, about 10 000 square kilometres, could be used for growing energy plants for fuel production.
"The production of synthetic fuels from natural gas is a state-of-the-art technology. The properties of the fuel do not change. However, this type of synthetic fuel can result in a carbon dioxide saving if associated gas (for instance, the gas produced together with oil, which is normally flared) is used."
Volkswagen sees hydrogen as a possible fuel of the future. However, it will be best to combine hydrogen with fuel cell technology.
According to Dr Eichhorn, "There are still at lest three technological barriers to overcome: the regenerative production, storage and distribution of hydrogen. Volkswagen therefore believes that hydrogen technology will not be used before 2015."
Hydrogen will only result in a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions if it is produced from renewable sources. However, carbon dioxide reduction with regenerative energy production is not only possible if elementary hydrogen is used as a fuel. SunFuel can be stored and distributed using existing infrastructure and is less costly to produce than hydrogen. This is why Volkswagen sees SunFuel as a promising fuel for the future.

     Not true.
       Biodiesel is being sold in the US as we speak for anywhere from $.99
to $2.50 a gallon, depending upon whether it's made from waste or virgin
vegetable oil. Given the economies of scale working here, once they build
up a larger presence, those prices will drop. And, if I'm not mistaken,
much of Europe is already mandating that all diesel be sold with at least
20% biodiesel.
        You might also look at Brazil which fuels a large portion of it's
vehicles with ethanol already.
          VW's new fuel will be even cheaper.

    That's a common arguement used against biofuels which doesn't hold water. In
the first place, whether it's biodiesel or ethanol, you still have the vast
majority of the food left after you extract the oil or ethanol -- meal cake or
"brewer's grains" (a very high quality protein).
Right at the moment we have  farmers (US) being paid *not* to grow, and/or
growing at a loss. Corn is now by far the cheapest fuel for home heating.
    Right, but there's a tremendous amount available right now, and an awful lot
getting dumped in landfills and  illegally down drains.
   And if you start looking at gasification of waste biomass, there are amazing
amounts available at least in western countries.

   Here's a site comparing corn to other fuels:
And realize that organic/sustainable agriculture is gaining ground rapidly, at
least in the US and Europe, and they *can* grow crops with equal or higher
yeilds than chemically dependant farmers. So the environmental "issue" is really
a straw horse.
   Besides which, there are a great many other non-traditional crops which yeild
far better than corn. Take cattails, for instance.
Yields of 1000-4700 gallons per acre (depending on climate and how many crops
per year) are possible. Most farmers here in WI have portions of fields which
are unusable in wet years -- don't fight nature, go with the flow, stop draining
those areas and plant them to cattail instead. Simple stuff -- just a lack of
knowledge, really.

Global atomic agency confesses little can be done to
safeguard nuclear plants
Wednesday, September 19, 2001
By William J. Kole, Associated Press
VIENNA, Austria - Security is being tightened at the world's
nuclear power plants, an international watchdog agency said Monday,
but it conceded that little can be done to shield a nuclear
facility from a direct hit by an airliner.
Most nuclear power plants were built during the 1960s and
1970s, and like the World Trade Center, they were designed to withstand
only accidental impacts from the smaller aircraft widely used at
the time, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said as it
opened its annual conference. "If you postulate the risk of a jumbo jet
full of fuel, it is clear that their design was not conceived to
withstand such an impact," spokesman David Kyd said.
U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham was among delegates
from 132 nations who opened the conference with calls to better
safeguard nuclear plants and to keep nuclear materials out of
terrorists' hands.
Abraham brought a message from President George W. Bush to
the Vienna-based IAEA, urging the agency to keep pace with "the
real and growing threat of nuclear proliferation." The world "must
ensure that nuclear materials are never used as weapons of terror,"
Abraham said. "We cannot assume that tomorrow's terrorist acts will mirror
those we've just experienced."
In the wake of last week's attacks in New York and
Washington, governments have tightened security outside nuclear power
and radioactive waste facilities worldwide.
But Japan, which is heavily dependent on nuclear energy and
has 52 nuclear plants, warned Monday that although tighter security
is needed, nothing can shield the plants from attacks by
missiles or Conference delegates, who began Monday with a minute of
silence and a song from the Vienna Boy's Choir in memory of the victims of
the U.S. attacks, met behind closed doors Monday and Tuesday on ways
to improve plant security.
In the West, nuclear power plants were designed more with
ground vehicle attacks in mind, Kyd said. Although many were
designed to withstand a glancing blow from a small commercial jetliner,
a direct hit at high speed by a modern jumbo jet "could create a
Chernobyl situation," said an American official who declined to be
identified. However, the buildings that house nuclear reactors
themselves are far smaller targets than the Pentagon posed, and it would be
extremely difficult for a terrorist to mount a direct hit at an angle
that could unleash a catastrophic chain of events, Kyd said.
If a nuclear power plant were hit by an airliner, the
reactor would not explode, but such a strike could destroy the plant's
cooling systems. That could cause the nuclear fuel rods to overheat
and produce a steam explosion that could release lethal
radioactivity into the atmosphere.
The IAEA said it would work more closely with Interpol and
other police agencies to minimize the risk of nuclear materials
falling into terrorists' hands. Over the past 12 months, there have
been 13 known interceptions of trafficked nuclear material
worldwide, the agency said.
Officials said it takes at least eight kilograms (17 1/2
pounds) of plutonium or 25 kilograms (55 pounds) of enriched uranium to
produce a single nuclear weapon, but that only miniscule amounts of
those metals are known to have been smuggled in recent years.
"A nuclear weapon requires tremendous expertise. We have no indications that any terrorist group is that advanced," Kyd said.
Although nuclear waste potentially could be used to produce
a "radiological" weapon, it would take months or years to
kill, and it is far cheaper to obtain compounds that could be used to
create lethal chemical weapons, he said.

U.S. GOVERNMENT WELFARE FOR OIL INDUSTRY
$114.6 BILLION ANNUALLY
The U.S. federal government provides up to US$ 114.6 billion
in subsidies annually to support the extraction, production
use of petroleum, such as research and development and
financing. The federal government also spends up to $1.6
yearly on regulatory oversight, pollution cleanup and
costs connected to the oil industry, the group said. In
U.S. Defense Department spending allocated to safeguard
world's petroleum resources totals $55 billion to $96
billion a=20
year, according to the International Centre for
Assessment. Tax subsidies don't end at the federal level, as
group said most state income taxes are based on oil firms'
federal tax bills, which result in companies paying US $123
to $323 million less in state taxes.=A0 (C) Reuters Limited
The renewable energy and energy conservation industry
sectors are
concerned that the subsidies distort the free market and
make renewables
less economically competitive. They are calling for a

withdrawn from the oil industry. It is time, they say, for

    I've been training dogs for at least 35 years (not counting when I was a kid)
and it's pretty easy to have a dog that is both a good house pet, wonderful with
kids, and totally alert, totally on guard at all times. Depends what you start
with. I suggest Airedales as being willing to fight bears and lions (they are
used for that regualarly) and also being great family dogs, albeit needing a
_very_ firm hand and _lots_ of exercise. Best have two, then they wear each other
out, and provide twice as much security. Pair them with a mellow dog like a Lab
and they will drive it crazy.
      My cats ( all 5) love dogs. My dogs love cats.
     They never really sleep, and don't quit when the power goes out.
      Mine love my dogs - some (actually most) of my cats are feral cats who
first made friends with my dogs, then slowly allowed me to approach.
    What can I say? Except I can't imagine life without a dog. Or two, or
preferably 5 or so.
      hmm. well, why don't they go along? or why not cultivate a trusted someone
who can feed the dogs?
     Hardly.
     Hardly. Here, you get a $300 fine for feeding outside cats, $165 for
allowing a cat to roam.
     Well, that's the first thing you've said in this vein I agree with.
Cats (and dogs) know one fuck of a lot more about you then you know about them.
Speak kindly to them. We keep a bin feeder on the porch for cats, just like we
keep a bird feeder in the back yard. Don't betray them.
    Oh, and btw -- cats can also be great watchcats. I have a cat who absolutely
freaks when strangers come -- hides away where I can't even find him. If I come
home and he's in hiding, then I know.

   No, the point is that a lot of fairly old machines won't be obsolete for a
long time, at least running a decent OS.      Nope, I run gnome 4.0, and, I should say, I run it with 4 workspaces --
first one always has 4 gnometerminal sessions going, second has the latest
mozilla with at least 6 windows open, often acrobat reader as well, third one
has three gnometerminals and opera, which usually has at least a dozen sessions
open, and the fourth workspace usually has openoffice running.     I don't notice anything particularly slow. Compared to a 700mhz AMD at work
and a 1ghz I've played with, it's not bad. Oh, and also it's always running
apache, postfix, and usually mysql.     It would be nice to compile kernels faster. But even compiling them with all
the above running isn't that bad, and doesn't seem to seriously slow down the
   No, mozilla and opera.
   Well, this box (the tower case itself is about 10 years old) recently got
upgraded from a 200mhz to a 266 (actually it a 350 but the mb won't go that
fast, so one of these days I'll upgrade the mb, but I'm in no hurry), and it has
256 megs of RAM. DIMMS, of course. It also has a 16meg Matrox video card which
helps.     I suppose if you're a gamer or doing a lot of big graphics, you'd need more
power, but for what I'm doing. Heck, I can recall running a web server for a
fairly big library and a mail server for over 400 accounts on little 200mhz
boxes. Worked fine -- still would.     OTOH, if it looks like DRM is going to get mandated, I'll probably go out

   All quite true. I've got a 486X33 w/20meg that runs linux just fine,
commandline only, although I've got gnome working on it, I don't bother. Good
enough for firewall, router, etc. And I had a bunch of P100 w/16meg that I was
running for awhile as remote boot/NFS/NIS workstations. They worked pretty well,
but were slow with KDE or gnome so went with Afterstep. Also loaded StarOffice
very, very slowly, but Word Perfect popped up fairly well. Granted, I'd rather
use at least a 200, but those were good enough for reading email and websurfing.
   Actually I was recently working with a library that had all 486 machines,
486DX-100 w/32 megs -- running W95, and even they were usable for web surfing.    On my main home linux box, a 266, adding the second 128 DIMM didn't seem to
help a great deal -- mind you, I don't doubt that people can see clear
differences with benchmarks and all, but I can't recall the last time I ran any.
I've also got a dual-processor 200mhz (604e)  Mac with 512meg, it seems fairly
fast, good enough for watching DVD movies, although one of these days when I've
got a lot of loose change I'll probably stick a pair of G4's in that and add
another 512 of RAM, just for the heck of it. 8-)

  As a sysadmin in various libraries, I can attest to the fact that most library
software is set to drop the record of what anyone has checked out as soon as the
book returns. I know that most librarians are extremely opposed to the whole
concept of anyone knowing what other people are reading, know also of one case
of a library clerk being fired when it was discovered that they were spying on
the reading habits of other librarians. And when the FBI tried back in the 50's
and 60's to access library records they were almost universally stonewalled.    While I realize it would be possible to reset the software to keep the
records longer, if it were indeed happening, everyone working in that library
would be aware of it, and people would be talking. I don't know of any way it
would be possible to make the software keep track of just one person, it would
have to keep the records for everyone. Of course, someone could keep track
manually, but I'd be willing to bet that if this were happening at all, the ALS
would know about it and would be filing suit against the DOJ.

   Obviously you don't realize how pissed off librarians would be about it.
There would very quickly be a court challenge, just as there was a court
challenge to it back in the 50's, and just like there has been a court challenge
to everything else like this -- the filtering acts, etc.
   How would they serve this order? If they came to me as the sysadmin, I'd have
to talk to my boss, the director about and also to an attorney, before I did
anything for them. And if I changed the settings on the database to keep all
records, everbody in the library would know about it very quickly, and there
would be a some real pissed off people demanding to know why I had done
it. Furthermore, most libraries these days have joint databases with a bunch of
libraries in the area, and they would notice the change and would be jumping up
and down, demanding public meetings, etc.    So the only way they could have it done is to approach someone to have them
look at the system day by day and write down what the victim of the warrant was
checking out. And what if he didn't check it out, just read it in the
library? So much for that data, there'd be none. Or would the Feebs just have
one of their own come into the library each day and access the staff side of the
software -- people would certainly notice that too. People would talk, believe
me. You can't get people to do something that pisses them off and expect them to
really cooperate.    I'd be willing to bet that in most libraries if they didn't file a court
challenge the victim would get an anonymous phone call from a pay phone some
night.

How could the library have the info, it's SOP to *not* keep the info, as I said. Most libraries wouldn't dare keep the info, if other librarians found out about it there would be all sorts of nastiness. A library director of a library that kept that sort of info would be destroying his own career if he expected to go anywhere else. And I think cooperating with the feebs would do likewise.
    Nobody really believes the gov't anymore -- Asscruft would be spat upon if he entered most libraries. I think at this point most educated people recognize the Un-Patriot act for what it is - the USA Fascist Manifesto. There's lots of people in libraries who have no doubt at all that 9/11 was engineered by the CIA to give the military the pretext to invade Afghanistan and regain control of the opium market. That's what the "War on Some Terror" is all about, that and another big domestic power grab by the feebs, just like the "War on Some Drugs."

   You'd probably be surprised then, because I'd bet it has been
computerized. In WI and MN at least, even the tiniest libraries are on line. It
came about because of laws mandating that all public libraries belong to a
library consortium, and the consortiums run the centralized databases. If they
don't join the consortium, they can't get state funding, and since most
libraries are strapped for cash, they join. And the computer revolution has been
going on in libraries for a decade now -- I can recall libraries where the staff
was terrified of computers, but most of those people either got on board or
retired. I'm sure there are non-computerized libraries in backwards states like
AL or MS, where they don't even fund the public schools, let alone libraries,
but NJ? Hardly.
   It's a matter of policy not to keep records, that, and the fact that library
software comes with that turned off by default. In some cases I think it would
take custom programming to turn it on. And in most cases, since most systems
librarians are not really computer gurus and rely heavily on outside
consultants, they would have to call the software manufacturer or an outside
consultant to help them figure out how to turn on the retention of patron
records after the books is checked back in. And then explain to them *why* they
would want to do such a nasty thing. And, as I said, there would be immediate
outrage on the part of the other librarians with much shouting and wailing and
demands for explanations, and demands that it be turned off.
   I think most people don't realize what strong civil libertarians most
librarians are -- and how much privacy and freedom of speech is stressed in
library administration and library schools.

read/copy it right there, totally anonymously. Of course, in the past when the
fedzis wanted access to patron's records, it was more on the level of thought
crime -- were they reading commie lit. Is that what they're after now -- whose
reading Islamic texts? Put them on the list to be tortured.    Also I just realized that if they allowed the fedzis access to the staff side
of the database, so they could read the victim's records, they would then also
have the ability to manufacture evidence, check out books in that person's name.    Exactly. And most ISPs don't have the moral backbone that librarians do, they
all roll over without a wimper. I think the fedzis would have to be seriously
stupid in the first place to even attempt to get libraries to spy on patrons --
there's far too many old '60s radicals in libraries who would love the
opportunity to shout it from the rooftops, make a real cause out of it. It's
totally absurd for the fedzis to think that they can tell anyone not to talk
about it anyway -- there's no possibility that could pass constitutional
muster. Are they going to start arresting citizens as "material
witnesses" because they refuse to cooperate? That would go over real well. Maybe
we should hope they do, all the better to get protestors out in the streets.    It's pretty clear the courts are starting to really frown on the current
fedzi power grab, as is congress.

   We lived for a long, long time in far northern MN in a cabin with no
electricity or running water. When I had to pee in the middle of the night, I'd
just run outside and pee in the yard. Summer or Winter, it made no difference,
and I never found it a problem standing out there buck naked and barefoot at 30
below. Can't imagine that 40 below would be much different. And since my wife
objected to yellow snow right by the house, I had to walk at bit away, not clear
to the outhouse, but a piece.    OTOH, I did once when we lived up about halfway between Jasper and Prince
George, BC fall thru the ice in the Fraser River up to my waist (fully clothed
tho) and my legs lost all feeling almost immediately. Of course, that river up
there was pretty close to being straight off a glacier and was too cold to swim
in even in July or August. I likewise went thru the ice to my waist in N. MN

   Duh! You don't know much about biology, eh? CO2 makes plants grow. Plants and
animals interact that way -- they exhale oxygen for us and we exhale CO2 for
them.    I could care less what any report says, I get an immediate sick feeling from
breathing tobacco smoke. And a great many other people do as well.  (snip)
  No, actually, banning cars in cities is a great idea. And, as a matter of
fact, since I ride a bicycle a lot, I often *do* get a sick feeling from
breathing car exhaust, at least from some that are apparantly burning
"reformutlated gasoline".    Not for me it wouldn't. I'm overjoyed at the prospect of all the airlines
going tits up. At least if the USG would let them instead of pumping more
subsidies into them. I took my last commercial flight about four years ago --
never again.    Toxins? Particulates, yes, but not many toxins. And you're right, Mother
Nature will always win in the end.    "don't stand downwind" -- that's a pretty simplistic answer. Impossible to do
when you're moving down the street. The bottom line is this: No one has the
right to do something in their space that adversely affects my space, whether
it's smoking in public or the farmer next door who sprays pesticides which drift
over to my land, or puts chemicals on his land which get into my well.    Sure, I guess I could just walk around with a pellet gun and zap anyone
whose smoke bothered me, right? Why not? After all, I'm not really seriously
harming them, just more like a temporary annoyance.

people who got physically sick from the smell of certain perfumes. That's a lot
more rare than people who are affected by tobacco smoke tho. The feeling is a
lot like the one you got when you smoked your first cigarette as a kid.  Both my wife and I get a really unpleasant feeling just walking down the aisle

      So the native americans here before 1492 weren't free? They did, of
course, have private property -- whatever they could carry with them -- but the
land was held in common. The idea that individuals could "own" land was not
known to them.    You're right, and it's really too bad the indigs here didn't realize soon
enough that they needed to kill each and everyone of those euros who landed here
and thought they could "own" land.    People can smoke in public if they wear some sort of helmet which contains
all the smoke, otherwise they are using force to invade my body and I should
have the right to kill them for it.

   Right. Where is that? It's absolutely impossible to walk or ride a bike down
a city street without breathing tobacco smoke.    I'm always amazed at how many so-called libertarians don't get the concept
that their rights end where my nose begins. Everyone should have the right to
enjoy whatever drug they choose -- as long as their use of it doesn't interfere
with other people's rights to not use it.    So you really think some drug addict has a right to stand on the street
getting his fix and at the same time forcing it upon everyone else in the
immediate vicinity? I'm amazed that anyone too stupid to understand such a
simple concept is even able to type on a keyboard.    By the same logic, it should be alright for me to mix up some LSD and DMSO
and carry it in a little squirtgun to spray smokers with, right?

    Well, not between clans, certainly tho between various
tribes. Territoriality is quite a bit different than dividing it up into
individual parcels, however. Nor was it like communism where the government
imposes group ownership from above, since they really had essentially no
government. It was really a totally different mindset, and one that the euros
couldn't even grasp. Nor could the native americans understand the euros -- why
would the euros leave the land where their ancestors were buried? Why would they
think that any of the local "chiefs" had any authority to speak for anyone
except themselves, as in most tribes they only had their own personal charisma
to exert any influence on thier "followers". No kings or rulers at all in the
european sense, just councils of old men, or more often, old women, who got
together and reasoned things out and gave advice.

couldn't communicate even when shouting. We don't need a new law for this, the
cops seem to be able to ticket them with no problem.
   Or like the idiots who's car stereo wakes us up at 2am, rattling our windows,

ours. We do need new or more effective laws to deal with this however. (rest of nonsense deleted)

   "merely annoy"? Excessive noise, or smoke, or chemical pollutants are not
mere annoyances, they are detrimental to health and safety and are physical
assaults, and anyone has a moral right, at least, to use force to protect
themselves from such. If it weren't for the fact that I'd get arrested, I'd
certainly have no moral qualms whatsoever about blowing away a smoker on the
street, or the guy with the loud stereo, or the farmer next door whose ag
chemicals ended up in my well water. People who are that inconsiderate of others
don't belong in the gene pool.     And what I'm seeing a lot of lately are people who profess to be
libertarians who see nothing wrong with forcing others to smoke along with them,
or listen to their choice of music, or disturb other people's peace and
quietude, or even forcefully poison other people's land and water. Especially
when it's done in the name of profit, eh?     The LP's stance on the Iraq war was more or less the last straw for me, but
certainly the attitudes of people like yourself have helped me to see the error
of my ways, i.e., voting libertarian the last 15 years or so. And, of course,
the statements from idots like Hettinga rejoicing in the looting of Iraq's
museums so "it can all go to the highest bidder" helped a lot.     It's really funny how many people I've talked to recently who were all
excited about the libertarian freestate movement until I told them that those
people would sell off all the public parks to the highest bidder, not to mention
trash all the environmental laws.     But it's all pretty irrelevant anyway, as is the LP. Just another dead horse
that very few people will ever vote for. Crypto-anarchy might actually get

 Sec. 12407.
 Sec. 12407. - National Guard in Federal service:
 period of service; apportionment
 Whenever the President calls the National Guard of a
 State into Federal service, he may specify in the
 call the period of service. Members and units called
 shall serve inside or outside the territory of the
 United States during the term specified, unless
 sooner relieved by the President. However, no member
 of the National Guard may be kept in Federal service
 beyond the term of his commission or enlistment.

whenever and however they want? Well, I suppose there's good precedence for that
too -- ask any Native American.    It certainly is in this case, and, I'm sure, in many others. If you sign a

   No, that would be taxing the WAN, not the LAN. Which, BTW, they already do,
both fed and state. Not by throughput, per se, but there's a tax on the lines,
the T1's or whatever.    If they tax the actual LANs, they would either have to mandate a bit meter on
each LAN, or, if they are talking about a property type tax --- hmm, that could
actually be a GoodThing@ -- think about it, a property tax on the LAN would mean
that companies would be reluctant to buy new hardware, and, as their computers

   Right, in fact if sheep (and sometimes cattle) eat Phalaris sp., for
instance, they get the "staggers", depending on the time of year and other
environmental conditions, and also upon the alkaloid makeup of the particular
cultivar. Phalaris, of course, contains fairly large amounts of tryptamines,
like dimethyltriptamine (DMT), as do many other plants. And thank the Goddess
for that -- but sheep don't like it. Or maybe they do, and just aren't saying.

  The web boards (forums) like phpNuke, et al, are not nearly as useful as
listservs. The problem is that you have to go there. So, for instance, for the
lists I admin, if someone puts out an announcement of an upcoming event, and
people don't think to go look at the forum for awhile, they get the annoucement
too late. Not a good thing.    Another serious problem with them is that if you don't go there for awhile,
the messages pile up, if it's a fairly active list, and become overwhelming. The
tendency is then to just skip them. You also can't filter out the people you
don't like -- a real drag.     As for the lne.com blocks on "spammers", that bit me too. When my dsl line
ip changes, sometimes I can post to lne, sometimes I can't. So I just subscribe
to lne to get the spam free postings, and then post to minder.net.  -- Harmon Seaver

   No, it went to the correct address. I've set up and run majordomo lists, so
am fairly familiar with the procedure. The problem is that my email server sits
on an ameritech dsl line, and in the last year or so, a number of domains have
begun rejecting email from such. Some because it's a "block of IPs used for home
dsl lines", some because "someone on your network has been sending spam", etc.    IIRC, didn't you yourself have a problem awhile back mailing to lne.com? I
haven't been able to mail to it for a long time, but stayed subscribed because
of Eric's good filter, and just posted thru another node.     With other domains, like new.rr.com that reject mail from my server, I just
map it to go thru the ameritech smtp server, which works but is annoying. At
this point there are eight domains I've had to do that with. Could have done it
with lne.com too, of course, but prefered to not have my posts to cpunks going
thru the ameritech server with it's (probably) attendent carnivore box. Maybe
that's irrelevant -- maybe they have it on the gateway routers instead.

   Nope, not a chance. Most of the people out on strike were executives -- and
believe me, managers can never be considered workers. Talk to any working stiff,
they'd laugh their butt off at the idea. Having spent a good many years working
as a logger and other manual labor professions, I consider it an insult to the
working man to call execs "workers".    I think it's great Chavez fired them all. And actually, I'm even wondering if
they need any "scab" sysadmins. That might be very cool, to get a decent job in
what is beginning to look like one heck of a lot better place to live than the
US.    It's pretty clear by now that last Spring's attempted coup and the current
strike was all engineered by the CIA and the current whitehouse scum. Chaves

   No, not really. It's far too irregular for that, sometimes goes for over a

because it authenticates on the mac address of the cable modem. And dhcp can be
set up to always give the same ip to a certain mac address, but I don't think
the eoppp can, or at least they don't -- it always has to negotiate a
challange/passwd response which can be quite problematic -- sometimes the only
way to get it to work again is to unplug  the modem for 30 seconds or so, which,
of course, frustrates any script you have to automagically reset dns for your
domainname, or even just keep you online.    This would probably work okay, even ssh works despite ip changes, although it

and pork fat. And the Reich was rendering human fat.    Although canola oil is a much better source for fuel. And diesels a much
better IC engine for hybrids. Even in non-hybrids, VW builds some pretty nice
diesel cars, including the Lupo, on the market for a couple years now, which
gets 80mpg. And the prototype that VW's CEO drives around in that gets 280mpg.

   No, Tim is right. The Mormons might consider themselves to be "christian",
but are not recognized as such by any other denomination. In fact, they are
billed as a "dangerous cult" just like the Moonies, etc. by most christians.    If you really take a close look at Mormon, you'll also note that Lucifer is
considered the brother of Jesus and of equal, or even more important standing.
   And even more interesting are their rites for initiation into the Temple
(most Mormons never go thru this, only the elect) where the member, both male
and female, is completely disrobed, their body washed (every square inch) by
other people, then anointed, again, every inch, and painted with occultic
symbols, and they are then dressed in a sacred undergarment which they must wear
the rest of their lives. Even when bathing, at least one arm or leg has to stay
in the sacred underwear. They swear alligence to Lucifer during the ceremony,
among other things.    Tim is also right about the similarities to Islam. Joseph Smith was a con
artist who went to prison for scamming people with his "peep stone" which he put
in his hat, stuck his face into the hat, and was then able to read instructions
from the stone. Originally he was using it to "find" buried treasure, and this
scam got him busted, later he used the same "peep stone" trick to "find" the
"sacred writings", etc. Like Muhammed, he soon realized the necessity to have
mulitiple wives. He also, and some of the leaders after him, got the holy word
from god that told them that all the worldy goods of their non-mormon neighbors
belonged to them, and they went out raiding farms and towns, which got them run
out of New England, then run out of IL. which is how they ended up in Utah.    Bizarre group. Read their history -- fascinating stuff. So is the history of
Islam. A poor man, Muhammed married a rich widow old enough to be his mother,
got visited by angels, started Islam, decided men needed multiple wives, etc.

   Bullshit -- it's about the basic right to having your own personal space and
to not be assaulted by others, something that some knee-jerk rightwingers don't
get. Everyone has a right to use whatever drug they want, they don't have a
right to force others to partake of it.    Nothing could be more simple. But because we have a number of people in this
society who don't get it, and who are too selfish and inconsiderate of others to
observe common courtesies, we get laws to spell it out for them. It's like drunk
driving laws, zoning laws, etc. Yes, you can drink all you want, but no, you
can't then drive. Yes, you have a right to private property, but no, you can't
allow the house to fall down or do something else with it that adversly affects
my property value.    There's always going to be at least a minimal state that lays out these sort
of restraints, it's the only way large numbers of people can live in close
proximity to one another. Which, BTW, is what the thread started with -- the
fact that the state has to have some powers to deal with seriously infectious
diseases. And likewise that it has to have some power to restrain those who
don't respect the rights of others.
    I think that some of the people here have some fantasy that the state will
totally wither away and there will be no restraints on anyone's behavior except
economic ones. Or else believe in some equally fantastized society where
everyone will just willingly respect others and all will live in peace and
harmony -- which is absurd, especially given the fact that for whatever reason,
young people are increasingly oblivious to the rights of others and very much
unconcerned with anything but thier own gratification.

   That's obviously covered under the 1st's "freedom of the press". What does
that have to do with non-humans (corporations) having Constitutional rights? The
arguement always put forth is that corporations have the right to make campaign
contributions, because that's "freedom of speech". But I guess if those rights
are going to be extended to non-humans like corporations, then there's no way to
stop them from being extended to other non-human entities as well, such as
animals and trees. Or even rocks.

   Could be more sinister than that, an attempt to stigmatize thinkers as
weird. Especially when you look at the phenomenon of the rise of ADD. When I was
growing up, there was no such thing as ADD, and,indeed, I don't remember having
kids in my school who exhibited those symtoms. There were dumb kids, of course,
and daydreamers, but I don't recall the weirdly restless, buzzy kids you see so
many of now.    So what caused ADD -- something in the water, like flouride? Or some food
additive, or some form of pollution? We know that there are a number of
chemicals in the environment today that mimic various hormones which then cause
imbalances in animals, or, for instance, aluminum suspected in alzhimers.
Perhaps in the dumbing down of Americans -- and there is a true dumbdown, US
kids consistently get lower scores than kids in other countries -- those who
weren't exposed to the same nerve agents, say, need to be now demonized as the
"odd ones", the "weirdos", "too smart for their own good", and definitely "too
smart for *our* good" that the proles need to watch out for along with the other

   True, well, almost -- there was a lot of resistence and various areas delayed
until well into the 60's-70's. And some perhaps never did. At any rate, I don't
think I was ever exposed to fluoride until an adult.
    Aluminum pans are a serious no-no, regardless whether they defintely cause
alzhimers or not. Once I tried the "take a dark, well-oxidized cooking pan, cook
some tomatoes in it" test, I never cooked with Al again. Just read about the new
findings of good old teflon migration. Freaky.    Well, yes, I'm sure the inordinate amounts of sugar has an serious
effect. Not to mention all the other weird little additives in candy and pop
that humans never evolved with.     Yup, for sure. I like kids but I'd never want to teach K-12 these days, most
kids seem to have no discipline whatsoever, and I don't have that much patience.
   Well, that's sort of what I was getting at. ADHD becomes the norm and the
normal kid becomes the weirdo. I remember getting so involved in reading that

  By some. It is, however, a poison, and one that migrates into any even
slightly acidic food.   Nonsense. There are far too many very old people with no evidence of
alzhimers. They used to say the same thing about senility and dementia, until it
was shown that the primary problems were diet and/or a lack of stimulation. And
also a problem with -- can't recall the term, but it's a loss of stomach enzymes
that absorb B12.    Ah, yes, just think what the modern protective society is doing to the gene
pool. Eyeglasses is just one example -- how many people today would starve
quickly if thrown back into a hunting/gathering culture without their specs? Or
just look at the difference in the last 100 years or so, where children who were
"slow" were kept home on the farm, never married; whereas today they move out on
their own, meet others like themselves, breed. And I'm not even talking about
the welfare aspect, or the seriously retarded -- when I was a kid there were a
lot of families with members who stayed home with the folks, or went to live
with various relations, just a little too slow or too spooky.

   Or OTOH, it could have done some strange things to entire generations of
humans. Nerve agents being what they are, I wonder if there's ever been a
serious neurological study?    Yes, having lived for a long time in northern MN where there has never been
any spraying for bugs, and where they are far more numerous than in most of the
US, I've never been all that bothered by mosquitoes. Black flies are worse, but
for a shorter season. We also discovered that if you don't use scented soaps and
shampoos, perfumes, etc, you aren't bothered nearly so much. We also didn't use
repellent much at all, just a drop or two on the shirt collar and/or cap when
they were really bad, and, if you were working in the garden in the evening, a
bug headnet was great. It's also a matter of temperament, it was funny to notice
how tourists would start flapping around, attracting a cloud of bugs, while
you'd stand nearby unaffected, and using no repellent.    I doubt the indigs were bothered all that much. Of course, malaria and yellow
fever were a problem in the far south, but most of NA doesn't have that
problem. West Nile virus is now spreading around, but a large scale study of
dead birds on the East Coast determined that most were killed by ag chemicals,
not the virus.

   Certainly sugar has a large effect, chocolate, however, should be soothing.   definitely not Oshkosh, such inovation would never be allowed by city
officials. People here are too dumb to ever come up with such an idea anyway, it
would have to become the norm everywhere else for a few years before it would be
adopted here. When we were working with the local gov't community garden
committee, and suggested that they quit applying chemical fertilzers and
pesticides to the garden areas, noting that the Madison community gardens had
gone organic 30 years ago, one of them stated "Oh, but that's Madison." Finally
got them to stop the chemicals, but they still insist on coming in every Spring
with heavy equipment to plow up all the plots, and, given the wet clay soil
there, can't do that until very late, so people aren't allowed into their plots
until May 25 -- in an area where you want to plant potatoes and peas mid
April. Our suggestions that people just be allowed to do it themselves with
tillers or by hand as they do elsewhere came to naught -- "But we've always done

   Yup, for sure, but community gardens are a nice answer for city dwellers. We
own property in the city, but the house takes up 90% of the land, no room for
any real garden other than shrubs and flowers. We have no lawn to mow.
We also have 40 acres, half fields/half woods, in MN, but can't live there right
   Yes, that's what we've done this year.     Hmm, I've never seen that sort of a problem with community gardens
anywhere. The vast majority of the people work pretty hard on their plots. And
also there's no reason for tax dollars going into it, especially most places
where they don't plow, etc. In fact, it should be fee-generating. Each plot
costs $20 @ year here to rent.     Why would community money be handed out to the gardeners?

   And how does this constitute socialism? I guess it depends on the
neighborhood, but there certainly doesn't seem to be any of that sort of thing
here. Most of the gardeners here are Hmong, and I'd imagine that if such started
occuring, people would start doing guard duty.    OTOH here, we've had kids torturing animals at the zoo and recently some
decided to hack down a lot of the young trees in the main park. At any rate,
vandalism and theft certainly isn't socialism, unless it's being done by the

to take a few pieces of firewood and drill a big hole in them, put in a quarter
stick of dynamite with caps attached in each, then seal the hole with woodputty
and rub some dirt on it while still sticky to hide the hole. Leave on outside of
pile where theives will grab it first. Turns those cast iron stoves into

open sandals, no socks - and a spend a lot of time wandaring through the woods
hunting mushrooms. My favorite mushroom woods is just thick with poison ivy, I
don't even bother to try to avoid it, just wade thru it. And I used to be very
allergic to it years ago, but I think you must desensitize to it the more you're
around it. And as I said before, the mosquitoes really aren't that bad, just
quit swatting at them. I'll take bugs over smokers anytime.

    Sounds like a very poorly administered community garden. The only big city
gardens I've seen were in Portland, OR, and they were fenced and gated and
locked at night. The gardens themselves looked very productive and well
tended. As are all the ones I've ever seen in smaller communities. And as are
the ones in NYC that Tyler's reported on. For a short while I was on a list of
community garden administrators, I can post the address if you like, perhaps you
could get feedback on these particular gardens being the way they are. From that
traffic on that list, what you are seeing is not at all the norm.    5x9? Why the hell would I bother with a 5x9 plot? The plots in the local
gardens here are 20x40 and I had two of them, and even that isn't really at all
sufficient. We used to have one garden of 100'x100' down by the house, then
another 50x80 up above the house mainly for potatoes and berries, things the
deer wouldn't eat, plus my wife's flower gardens.    The problem with finding other garden plots around here would be that most of
the land is either being farmed or subdivided and built on. Even if you were
able to find a small corner of a farm field to lease, it would be heavily
chemicalized. Actually, some of the local Hmongs have joined together and bought
farmland so they can have bigger gardens.    5x9 -- geez, I garden more space than that on my porch roof in containers. Anyway, I think the community garden concept is a pretty good one. It gives city
people a chance to grow play in the dirt, and also an opportunity to meet and
talk to people who like gardening, see how they do things, etc. It's been really
interesting seeing how the Hmongs do stuff, and fun trying to communicate with
some of the older ones. And in fact it was my wife working with some of the
Hmongs who got the administrators to stop using chemicals on the plots - since
the vast majority of gardeners *are* Hmong, the powers that be finally gave in
when the Hmongs said they wanted to garden in their traditional way.

    It depends a lot on the size of the city, of course. For most smaller cities, none of that is needed. In the smaller cities around here, for example (50K-100K) the gardens are on the outskirts and there are no fences, etc. And the fees *should* be adequate to cover any admin costs. The Oshkosh community garden, for instance, is located on the grounds of the county work-farm, the plowing (which isn't needed, and, in fact, is counter-productive) and other minimal maintenance is done by      I think as Tyler has pointed out in NYC, it is the local people who do this themselves, it's not the gov't.

know are very pissed about this and have no interest in cooperating if at all
possible.    So far I only know of one instance of the pigs coming to a library and
demanding info on a patron. And it wasn't the fedzis, it was the local pigs and
they weren't after a terrorist, they were after some poor souls library records
because they suspected him of something to do with drugs. And I'll bet you that
the vast majority of pig demands on libraries are in the same vein.    This one was on the web:

attorney. When he could not be located in time, she contacted ALS and was
advised to give them the information requested since it was accompanied by a
court order."

interested if there is something to steal at the bust, like drugs or money, or
there might be property to grab. Just try and get them to do anything about

   Yes, I'm well aware of what it's trying to say, but it's really a very poor
analogy based on a faulty premise.    Not "may" -- they always do, just as dogs do. And not just in first meetings,
it continues virtually forever, including sometimes all-out fighting, but
sometimes too subtle for most humans to even be aware of.     We have three or four distinct groups of cats living here that we feed. Two
in the house, two in the garage/greenhouse who once lived in the house but could
not resolve the dominance issue between one male in the house and one alpha
female now in the greenhouse. Then there are the more or less permanent two
females that live on and under the front porch, who also have serious unresolved
issues with the Mama Fritz of the greenhouse (who does get outside during the
day). Dominance also goes down the line, watching the 3 young offspring of one
of the porch ladies makes that pretty clear, one of those bosses the other two,
but all are subservient to the two older females, and their mother, Shy, clearly
bosses Bobbette, the other older female. Neither of them take crap from Mama
Fritzi, in fact one day I watched Bobbette whup Mama's butt, but that hasn't
deterred Mama one iota.
    And then we have the feral toms who come to the permanent bin feeder on the
porch as well, who have their own inter-relationships.     If you read any texts on cat behavior, you'll find dominance a well studied
attribute. Most say there is *always* an alpha cat, even if it isn't apparent to
the casual observer.

understanding how we reached this point -- it wasn't even 100 years ago when
girls of 17 were considered in danger of becoming old maids if they weren't
married already. In fact, when I was growing up, the legal age for marriage in
Mississippi was 12 for girls and 14 for boys, with parents permission. Without,
it was 14 and 16. Many, many states had similar laws. And, in fact, back then at
least one state, Maryland IIRC, had a "statutory rape" age of 8.    So, while on the one hand, more young teens are having sex fairly openly, and
at younger and younger ages, even in preteen, some as young as 10 from what I
read in the press; the laws are becoming more and more repressive. And not just
the law, also the prosecutors -- in Racine, WI a month or so ago it was
announced that prosecutors had charged a girl and boy, both 15, with having sex
with a child -- each other. WTF is going on?     What else is this but religious oppression? Look, I can marry a girl (with
parents okay) on her 16th birthday here in WI, but if I just have her come live
with me, I could spend probably most of the rest of my life in prison. This is
insane -- on what basis, under what Constitutional authority, does the state get
to decide that the christer "marriage" vows are sacred and legal, and a pagan or

    You obviously have never done any door-to-door. People are quite often very
interested. We've had fairly good success organizing people on local issues
which affect them, like opposition to street widening. Voter registration is the
same thing.
   The mention was "giving talks in libraries", which works fairly well. The
local library is the logical meeting place for local groups to hold meetings and

Someone was just trying to tell me that the FCC, et al, won't allow encrypted
phones or even the old style scramblers to be sold anymore. Have there been any
moves in that direction?

    Uh, the last I heard bin Ladin and the rest of al-queda hated socialists,
which is why they didn't jive with Saddam. And, in fact, wasn't that exactly
what the jihad in Afghanistan was all about -- killing commies?

    Bumazhkas? I thought I was pretty familiar with most weapons of the world,
but not Bumazhkas. What calibre are they? I've always liked those CZ Model 52
pistols and Model 32 subguns in .30Mauser. Loaded hot with a teflon coated
bullet they should punch thru armor well.

       Whoops, that should be "Model 23", not model 32. The 23 - 26 series from
whence the Uzi got it's basic design, IIRC.

@_subject: Citizen Chics Must Put Out 
References:   This last Memorial Day weekend, I was heading off to work at my fun historical
reinactor job at a state historic site (I get to run a 150 year old sawmill) and
dressed appropriately. My wife's car was parked behind mine in the driveway, so
I pulled hers out and into the neigbor's, pulled mine out onto the street, where
there is no parking -- but hey, FedEx and UPS stop there all the time, so do
contractors who are working on homes in the area and can't get their vehicles in
the driveways, this is a historic district afterall and driveways are pretty
damn small -- so just as I was about to get into my pickup and drive away, an
Oshkosh pig pulls up behind me, lights on. He says, "Is that your truck?" and I
say yes, I was just switching cars in the driveway. He says, as he gets out of
his car, "Step over here, please." Asks for my license, "You can't park
there." And I answer, "I'm not, I'm just switching cars."    Then things get more serious -- "I smell marijuana, do you know marijuana is
illegal?", which is total BS since it's been far too long. Then he says, "Do
you mind if I search you?", to which of course, I replied, "Yes I do, you have
no right to search me." I started to say, "Yeah, and I smell pigshit." but then
realized that if I did, I wouldn't probably wouldn't make it to my job. Normally
I would have escalated the scene as much as possible by bad mouthing him and his
mother as much as possible, but I really do enjoy playing at the historic site
and getting hauled to the jail for a few hours, even as much fun as that would
have been being as obnoxious as possible and giving them continual lectures
about how evil they are, how evil dubbya and asskruft are, how much I think that
people like them need to be rounded up and put into re-education centers and
given lobotomys so they can never bother decent people again -- still, I really
wanted to make it to the job.     So we were standing there at a bit of an impass, me saying "no, you cannot
search me." Then he says, "Well, for my own safety, I have a right to search you
for a weapon." I really, really, wish it had been some other time, so I could
have forced the issue and made him call for reinforcements, because it would
have been obvious to all and sundry that what this was really all about was the
big 3 foot tall lighted 24/7 peace sign on the roof of my house and the bumper
stickers on my truck and perhaps my hair, but -- ah well, maybe I'm getting old

    My feeling is that Kerry won't be really any different, except possibly in
the areas of environment and education. He'll be about like Klinton, maybe
worse. And like Klinton, he's a lot smarter, so a lot more people will be
fooled. One thing about Dubbya, et al, is they make a lot of really dumb
mistakes. Look at Cheney telling Sen. Leahy to fuck himself -- these morons even
turn off a lot of Republicans.

   John Stauber spoke at the Midwest Renewable Energy Fair this last Solstice
weekend, and talked a good bit about the myth of "liberal media" -- there is
none. At least not in the corporate media world, and not even at NPR.    He had a pretty good rant.   So did Amy Goodman of
Democracy Now.

References:    That's for sure -- you should read the history of the strike back around the
early 1900's on Minnesota's Iron Range. The goons would surround a whole small
town, then go from house to house beating *everyone*, even children, with
axehandles. Killed a lot of people too.    Not to mention all the goons they still hire all over the 3rd world to break
strikes, kill organizers and labor leaders, etc.    Nonsense -- corporations are not humans, they have zero rights. Together we
could be a partnership, with 100K others we could be a partnership as
well. Corporations where the owners (shareholders) and employees are not liable
for the crimes and debts of the corp should be illegal. And there's nothing at
all socialistic or statist about that -- in fact, it's more that corporations
require statism to even exiest.     Why not? If Thomas Jefferson and George Washington had their way,
corporations would be illegal in the US.

    Humans don't lose their rights, but they also shouldn't lose their
responsibility either. If a "voluntary association" injures me, each and every
person involved in it should be liable.

   No, but if the "club", as an entity, does such, you should be. If the
corporation pollutes, all and sundry owners and employees should be equally
liable. Or maybe liability adjusted to investment or wage, i.e., the biggest
stockholders and highest paid employees get the longest sentences.    The concept that no one is actually responsible for the criminal acts of a
corporation is patently absurd. It means that they only recourse for justice is
thru anarchistic action, guerilla warfare, and constant terrorism. Essentially a
return to the dark ages -- just as we now see before us.

   Yas, yas, yas -- and the only place we can see this being enacted is in
Venezuela, where more people carry copies of their Constitution than carry the
bible, and not only carry it, but know it by heart. How ironic that a leftist
movement brought this about.    Or politicians in general. I'll alway remember a professor correcting me when
I said something about some pol being "so stupid", and he responded: "Don't ever
think that they are stupid, they aren't stupid -- stupid people can be taught,
they can be persuaded with facts -- these people aren't stupid, they are venal,
they are evil."
