I wonder if you could help me.  Have you heard of any "leads" to help me find 2 people to join?  Perhaps there is someone who has been gifted many times over who would help me.  I have been in one activity for 2 months and talked to 40 something people.  I simply don't have the friends or contacts to find people to join me.  They are too afraid; they don't like to talk about money; they are afraid they will lose it; they have heard so many negative things; or they think it is illegal, a pyramid scam or something.
I am a conservative Protestant Christian lady, divorced, who hurts financiallly since I was divorced.  I came back to Chicago from L.A. and got myself deeply in debt on 2 credit cards.  I don't know what else to do.  Someone said there were "leads" out there.
I could try and get myself out of the one I'm in - and opt out.  But I believe in the concept.  If this is people helping people, can't someone help the new people?  I have another friend who lost her job in September and has had a very difficult time.  She doesn't have 2 friends either.  Thanks so much for your help,
