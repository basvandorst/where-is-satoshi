Right, it is highly unlikely but not impossible, maybe the devs have copies and are digging through it. Which also won't exclude that Segelmann's PC itself was hacked in and the code modified after he e-mailed someone about having his job concluded and was delivering the goods.
Considering that the tinfoilers were right all along during an entire decade, I'm also on the fence with this.
