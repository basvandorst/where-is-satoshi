In my mind this is all about property rights.  He (the business owner) doesn't have a right to make a property, he has the right to say what persons can and cannot do on his property.  If they refuse to comply he has the right to ask them to leave and possibly resort to force to remove them.  If money has been involved in the exchange (ie, the lesbians bought a ticket) they have a right to demand compensation IF their actions were not explicitly banned.  The owners reasons do not have to be moral, reasonable, intelligent, or even rationale.  It's his property.
