Hey Tim, really interesting post, but...
---snip--- The hint of illegality? Well, of course this is a reason, but the question
remains that if all people had legal access to nationalsocialist
propaganda such as "Mein Kampf", would the fact that that mainpart of our
society disrespect right-wing radicals not lead to the same attraction? I�m
not sure.
Disrespect of authority? Sounds funny for Nazis! :-) But I know
what you mean.
But certainly, this is not the reason that young men join the
national-socialist cause. It�s about a feeling of superority, about
finding an adventerous group of people that I fit in. And about finding a
simple answer to the question why I don�t have a job, money(, or a brain).
Olav Stetter,
P.S.: Please don�t mind my English. I know what you think about it when I
read it myself. :-)
