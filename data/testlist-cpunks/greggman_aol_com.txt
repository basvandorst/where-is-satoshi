In a message dated 95-10-09 12:34:33 EDT, you write:
Actually not a problem for mess-DOS: just overwrite to the next multiple of
the allocation unit size. Trivial indeed.  What you must *not* do is just
write to the end of current file ... you have to extend.  Good idea too is to
flush file buffers/reset disk subsystem before the next file writes so that
buffer garbage doesn't get stuck in at end of last sector(s) of new files.

Why do people insist this is the case?
ABsolutely not true under MS-DOS.
I haven't personally verified under a VxD file system (like 32bit disk
access) but ask yourself: if I expand (by appending new garbage data) the
current file to the next allocation-unit boundary, will that overwrite the
tail blocks of the current file????  Folks: it's sooooo easy.

MS-DOS? Selectively overwrite data not alloc'ed to files?  Try this:  I do it
all the time:
open a file for output
write garbage to file until the disk fills
delete file
do it again
... what could be simpler?  This will fill all unused allocation units with
garbage.  Do it until you feel comfortable.
