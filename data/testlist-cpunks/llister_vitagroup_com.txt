@_subject: Do you know anyone looking for a Cryptography position? 
Dear R.A.,
I am a technical recruiter, looking of for a Senior Security Engineer /
Cryptography expert for an outstanding client of mine in Colorado. Your
name has come up as someone strong in cryptography so I was wondering if
you might know anyone who is looking for a full-time position in
cryptography and who may be interested in a new opportunity?
I am looking for a security engineer with strong experience in
developing systems using a variety of standards (RSA, DES, AES, and/or
PKI). Additional experience with DRM would be a plus, but is not
required. This is a visionary position so the most important piece is
in-depth and broad-based practical knowledge of the standards and their
uses in high-tech systems. This is an outstanding opportunity for the
right person - hands-on and leadership opportunity in a great company
with super benefits and work on the cutting edge of very exciting
technology developments.
Please feel free to pass on my information or to contact me direct if
you know of anyone who might be interested.
