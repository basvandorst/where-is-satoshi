@_subject: What can the judge do to me? (fwd) 
+ From: Black Unicorn + + "Contempts such as failure to comply with document discovery, for + example, while occurring outside the court's presence, impede the + court's ability to adjudicate the proceedings before it and thus touch + upon the core justification for the contempt power....  Similarly, + indirect contempts involving discrete, readily ascertainable acts, + _such as turning over a key_ or payment of a judgment, properly may be + adjudicated through civil proceedings since the need for extensive, + impartial fact-finding is less pressing."  International Union, supra + (emphasis added).
+ I think it's clear, the court literally spells this out, that holding + a witness indefinitely until he complies with court orders is within + the discretion of a judge.  Compelling through sanctions the + production of a "key" (though I'm not sure a crypto key is directly + contemplated) is likewise clearly permitted.
Producing a physical key may or may not be testimonial under the
"production privilege" doctrine established by the Supreme Court in
Fisher and the Doe cases.  Producing a *crypto* key -- if it exists
only in one's mind -- is indisputably full-fledged Fifth Amendment
testimony.  I refer you to the language in Doe II (joined by all 9
Justices) distinguishing between "the key to a safe and the
combination to a safe" -- the latter enjoying full Fifth Amendment
protection from forced disclosure.

Roger  Schlafly sez:
+    [quotes from]
+    DOE v. United States, 487 U.S. 201; 108 S. Ct. 2341 (1988)
+ ...
+ I conclude that in a criminal case, all of the supreme court
+ justices agree that a criminal defendant cannot be forced to
+ reveal the combination to a wall safe, or any other information in
+ his mind, by the Fifth Amendment.
Except that the Fifth Amendment is not limited to "criminal cases" in
the way one might ordinarily understand that phrase.  One may assert
the Fifth Amendment in a civil case, in an administrative proceeding,
at a legislative hearing, or, indeed, in the absence of any formal
proceeding.  See _Kastigar_. (I posted a summary of Doe II just the other day.  Did it not reach
the list?)
Also, "any other information" is a little too broad.  You can be
forced to reveal "pedigree" information such as name and DOB.  See
_Penna. v. Muniz_ (1990).  Asking an apparently drunk driver the date
of his sixth birthday (as part of a DWI test) is, however, an effort
to elicit Fifth Amendment "testimony"; given the added factors of
potential incrimination and compulsion (implicit in custodial
interrogation sans Miranda warnings), the privilege may be validly
exercised in response to such a question.  See ibid.
The much more interesting question, from a legal perspective, is what
happens if your key/password/passphrase is written/stored on physical

@_subject: Bernstein ruling meets the virus law 
Bill Frantz sez:
+ + If lawmakers are to come up with a rational law, a big if, they will have
+ to differentiate between a bug in a "tame" worm which lets it get loose as
+ a virus, and a virus which was meant to be destructive from the get go. + And then they will have to decide what to do about the virus that was
+ designed to write, "Hi Mom!" on as many screens as possible with no
+ malicious damage, and bugs in it.
18 USC 1030(a)(5) makes such a distinction, treating intentional harm
more severely than releasing a virus "with reckless disregard of a
substantial and unjustifiable risk" of harm.  The latter is only a
misdemeanor; the former, a felony.
The statute didn't always make this distinction.  In fact, it was the
RTM case -- brought under the former felony-only version of the
statute -- that inspired the 1994 amendment dividing the offense into
two separate offenses.
