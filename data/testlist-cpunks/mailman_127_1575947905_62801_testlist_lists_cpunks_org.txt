@_subject: Other choices in software might work better 
Before trying to defrag or run Scan disk, be sure to exit every
single application that may be runing in the background.
Right click all the little icons on the right side of your task
bar and exit those applications.
The Defrag and Scan disk that comes with Windows isn't
very good. I would suggest searching  for
others. There are many free or low-cost programs that will
handle this job for you much more efficiently.
