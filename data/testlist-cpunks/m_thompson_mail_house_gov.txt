Dear Friend:
Thank you for contacting my Congressional Office. Due to the tremendous
increase in emails I receive from Americans across the country, I have
closed this account. However, you can continue to email me by visiting my
web site,  Please resend your message there.
This format allows me to receive emails directly from constituents of the
First Congressional District and I will be able to provide you with a
response to any problem or question you may have. Again, thank you contacting my office.
MIKE THOMPSON
Member of Congress
First District of California
