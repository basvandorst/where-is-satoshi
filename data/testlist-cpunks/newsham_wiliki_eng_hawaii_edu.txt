@_subject: white house blunder 
Even though the white house proposal may seem bad it could be
used to your advantage in some ways:
swap keys with someone else...   if serial number isnt sent
in transmission this takes gives a big headache when they try
to decrypt your stream.
use another encryption before sending to clipper chip...
this way everything looks normal, and if they are playing according
to the rules (cross fingers)  they dont know anything is fishy
until they try to get a warrant and decrypt. First keys wont match.  When they do find the correct key they'll
decrypt and get a file encrypted in another system.
This might be great for averting suspicion of using another crypto-
system.   Everyone will be using clipper, and your message will look
like its from the clipper chip.  It wont look like an RSA file
or DES'ed voice or whatever.  The chip gives you a opaque (hopefully)
envelope to put things into.

@_subject: Amiga programmers. 
somewhere under 5 MIPS on DSP chips.  Instructions including
fixed point multiplies and accumulations (not counting divisions).
Thats quite a load for a 68020 to bear and still do encryption
and communications isnt it?
I have been working on an encrypted link protocol,  I have
written a unix end (w/ sockets for debugging) as well as
some prototype amiga ends (nothing nice yet).  It is basically
a term program with an encrypted mode built in.  I have released
the unfinished but operational unix end so far (link.tar.Z)
but have been too pressed for time to work on it lately.
I am also working with a DSP chip and plan to implement LPC
at bandwidths of about 2000 bps.  This will be low quality
(less than toll quality, but "good enough" for..  well for
me :)
I hope the end product will be reproduceable for under $50.
(I am using the ADSP 2105 DSP microcontroller which offers
10 MIPS for about $12)
Someone has mentioned that there is a ZYXEL chip that has
CELP built in to it,  this might be a faster way to go,
does anyone have more details?
I plan to incorporate the two when I am finished to allow
encrypted voice between two endpoints,  and hopefully
also over some networks (were delay time doesnt cause too
much problems,  long distances over packet switching
might not work so nicely).
  I have developed and implemented the protocol engine of
the link protocol and written a unix end.
  I have started assembling (but not programming) the DSP
board,  I plan later to add on-board d/a and a/d but
for the time being I will be importing samples from the
amiga, and retrieving LPC coded data.
I am encouraging other people to use my protocol engine
and incorporate it into terminal programs.

you can do two FFT's by using the fact that:
  FFT( x(t) + j y(t) ) =  Z(w)
then X(l) = 1/2 ( Z(l) + Z*(N-l))
and  Y(l) = 1/2j (Zl) - Z*(N-l)) Where x(t) <-> X(w)
      y(t) <-> Y(w)
N is the length of both arrays
j is sqrt(-1)
Z* is the conjugate of Z (a+jb <-> a-jb )

@_subject: encrypted irc 
I have implemented an encryption scheme with key exchange
in an IRC client.  It is now in working condition.  Here
are the details.  Mail me if you wish to have a copy
sent to you.
---- file: README ----------
this is a tinyirc client (client not written by me)
but I added in encryption..  Right now encryption is
done in DES for messages and RSA for key exchange.
To set it up,  unarchive (you probably already did this)
then type :
     make
this should make a program called 'sock'
now you need to go into the RSA directory and make yourself
a keypair.
     cd RSA
     make genrsa
     make genprim
     genrsa
this makes two files  'public' and 'secret'.  You need to install
     mv secret ..
     mv public ../
and give out your public key to everyone you want to talk to.
This lets them send their key to you.
run sock:
      cd ..
      sock
join the same channel as your friend you wish to talk to:
      /join send them your key,  this lets them read any message typed by
you (note you have to be in the same channel as them)
      /key (note the public key must be in the current directory)
your friend will receive your key, and now everything you type
can be read by him.  In order to send your key to your friend
you must have the file  in your directory that
is 's public key.  He must have the matching
secret key in the file 'secret' in his directory.  If your
friend changes nick's and the filename of his key isnt the
same as his nick you can specify the file:
       /key  thats it!  Everything you type is encrypted with the same key
which is chosen at random when you start up 'sock'.  Every time
you use sock a new key is used.  Every time you want to talk to
a new person you have to send them your key.  Anyone who has
your key can read any of your messages,  so if you dont want
people reading your messages dont give them your key.  Everything
you type is encrypted.
some public keys are already provided in pubkeys/*
copy them into current directory to use them.
  (1) serial number and DES key are generated with rand()
      after seeding with time value.  They are generated at
      the same time, and serial number is a publically known
      value.  This could allow people to brute force search
      through the pseudo-random numbers and find your key.
      This *should* be fixed, any ideas/
  (2) RSA key as created by 'genrsa' is not very long!  It
      is crackable right now.  This could be lengthened
      easily enough by modifying genrsa.c .  The rest of
      the program doesnt care what length key is used.
  (3) You can send alot of garbage to someone's screen by
      sending out wrong key's and/or sending out bad
      data matching keys already aquired.
      possible solution: header inside of the encrypted
      data.  1 character would give a 1/256 chance of
      this attack working.
  (4) probably alot more I didnt think about.
there are two types of messages,  one to send keys across
to other people, one to send across encrypted messages, all
messages are sent to the current irc channel, not through messages
to individual people:
   SKPJACK:xxxx:yyyy:zzzzz
        xxxx - the nick name of the intended recipient
        yyyy - the serial number of the key being transfered
        zzzz - ascii encoded RSA data
     messages of this format are used to send private keys (DES
     keys) to the recipient, ie   /key nick.
     Messages received are ignored if xxxxx isnt our current nick.
   CLIPPER:xxxx:yyyy
         xxxx - the serial number of the key used to encrypt
         yyyy - the ascii encoded crypted data (DES)
     messages of this format are used to send encrypted chat
     messages.  Messages received are ignored if we dont have
     the key corresponding to the serial number.    ascii coding:  each byte is broken into 2 nybbles (4 bits)
   and sent across as two characters,  the first nybble
   is sent as   hi+'a' and the second is sent as lo+'A'
   so alternate characters are always upper then lower then
   upper case and so on.  (byte = hi<<4 + lo)
   Keys are generated randomly and each key has a random    32 bit serial number associated with it.  The program
   uses the serial number to decided which key to decrypt    with.  The program keeps all the keys it receives.
   All messages you type are sent with your key,  all messages
   you receive are decoded with the key matching the serial
   number sent with it.
Alot of this software was not written by me, In fact my part
was minimal.  I stole code from the following people:

If you have the pc's aranged nicely there are very few packets that need
be sent.  You can use broadcasts on each net, or multicasting (broadcasting
to a group).  You simply need to send out the password entry to crack.
You could break up the job space by networks, and on each network have
the machines negotiate for portions of the sub-job space.  Alternatively
you could have all machines attacking the key space randomly which
is not as efficient but still quite workable.  Finally if/when one
of the boxes gets a solution, it shouts 'i got it'.  It can broadcast
the solution, which will turn off all the other boxes and get
put onto some consol window somewhere, or some file.

Introduction to BlackNet
Your name has come to our attention. We have reason to believe you may be
interested in the products and services our new organization, BlackNet, has
to offer.
BlackNet is in the business of buying, selling, trading, and otherwise
dealing with *information* in all its many forms. We buy and sell information using public key cryptosystems with essentially
perfect security for our customers. Unless you tell us who you are (please
don't!) or inadvertently reveal information which provides clues, we have
no way of identifying you, nor you us. Our location in physical space is unimportant. Our location in cyberspace
is all that matters. Our primary address is the PGP key location:
"BlackNet" and we can be contacted (preferably
through a chain of anonymous remailers) by encrypting a message to our
public key (contained below) and depositing this message in one of the
several locations in cyberspace we monitor. Currently, we monitor the
following locations: alt.extropians, alt.fan.david-sternlight, and the
"Cypherpunks" mailing list.
BlackNet is nominally nondideological, but considers nation-states, export
laws, patent laws, national security considerations and the like to be
relics of the pre-cyberspace era. Export and patent laws are often used to
explicity project national power and imperialist, colonialist state
fascism. BlackNet believes it is solely the responsibility of a secret
holder to keep that secret--not the responsibilty of the State, or of us,
or of anyone else who may come into possession of that secret. If a
secret's worth having, it's worth protecting.
BlackNet is currently building its information inventory. We are interested
in information in the following areas, though any other juicy stuff is
always welcome. "If you think it's valuable, offer it to us first."
- trade secrets, processes, production methods (esp. in semiconductors)
- nanotechnology and related techniques (esp. the Merkle sleeve bearing)
- chemical manufacturing and rational drug design (esp. fullerines and
protein folding)
- new product plans, from children's toys to cruise missiles (anything on
- business intelligence, mergers, buyouts, rumors
BlackNet can make anonymous deposits to the bank account of your choice,
where local banking laws permit, can mail cash directly (you assume the
risk of theft or seizure), or can credit you in "CryptoCredits," the
internal currency of BlackNet (which you then might use to buy _other_
information and have it encrypted to your special public key and posted in
public place).
If you are interested, do NOT attempt to contact us directly (you'll be
wasting your time), and do NOT post anything that contains your name, your
e-mail address, etc. Rather, compose your message, encrypt it with the
public key of BlackNet (included below), and use an anonymous remailer
chain of one or more links to post this encrypted, anonymized message in
one of the locations listed (more will be added later). Be sure to describe
what you are selling, what value you think it has, your payment terms, and,
of course, a special public key (NOT the one you use in your ordinary
business, of course!) that we can use to get back in touch with you. Then
watch the same public spaces for a reply.
(With these remailers, local PGP encryption within the remailers, the use
of special public keys, and the public postings of the encrypted messages,
a secure, two-way, untraceable, and fully anonymous channel has been opened
between the customer and BlackNet. This is the key to BlackNet.)
A more complete tutorial on using BlackNet will soon appear, in plaintext
form, in certain locations in cyberspace.

The following sounded appealing to me because it gives

Matrix Extensions of the RSA Algorithm
Chih-Chwen Chuang and James George Dunham
CRYPTO '90
A new matrix extension of the RSA algorithm is proposed which is based
on the Cayley-Hamilton theorem and a one-way function.  The security
of this algorithm rests on that of the RSA algorithm and the one-way
function.  The computational efficiency of the new algorithm depends
on the dimension of the marix.  The most efficient implementation is
the 2x2 case in which both the encryption and decryption use a single
modulo arithmetic multiplication and single evaluation of the one-way
later in the paper..
'Under a chosen plaintext attack on the key, the security of the new
algorithm is equivalent to that of the RSA algorithm.  Under a known
plaintext attack on the message, the security of the system rests
upon that of the one-way function.'

@_subject: The need for FREE cryptography ... 
What I would like to see is libraries from PGP, along with some
additions.  Why PGP?  It would be nice to be able to use the
optimized IDEA and RSA algorithms from PGP.  More importantly it would
be nice to write programs that use the well established key ring
files.  This would solve problems of key ring distribution.  It would
also mean that crypto programmers need not worry about their own random number generation,  with all random number generation handled
by the PGP libs.  The advantage of this is that there would be 1
random number generator that did things right rather than a bunch
of implementations that had subtle flaws.  If everything shares the
same implementation, that implementation can be strengthened much
The PGP library itself is not enough though,  it is missing some
things that should accompany it:  DES/triple-DES and DH key exchange
for example.

I have been working lately on a program to encrypt my modem
traffic between home and the unix.  I call the program 'link'
for link encryption.  Currently it uses DES and RSA,  RSA to
exchange a random session key and DES to encrypt all general
traffic.  I spent some time today cleaning up some of the
code so that it would be more modular and portable.  The unix
end  i is presentable now but would require a remote end to
work along with it.  I dont feel that my Amiga end is
good enough to even use regularly, there are some bugs in the
Amiga end, and I haven incorporated the most recent changes into
it either.  I wrote the code to be modular and hopefully
easily attached to other term programs in hopes that people would
patch some code into their favorite term program and use it.
If anyone wants the unix code I'm giving it out now,  It is
a bit long so I wont post it to the list unless I get enough
replies (aand not too many "dont post it!" replies).  If anyone
has an ftp site they wish to put it on that is fine too.  I'm

please.  Its in no way complete, I plan to add more features
and hopefully robustness to the code in the future.

@_subject: scheme 
I posted this to sci.crypt,  I would also like the opinion
of the people on this list:
I have posted about this before, but this time I decided
to whip up some code so you can all see what I'm talking
about and all the details.
This encryption scheme uses XOR to encrypt data 1 character
at a time.  Because of this it is suitable for protocols
where you need to send single bytes (or less) at a time.
Examples of this would be interactive ascii.  Also it
is easily applicable to crippled lines like 7 bit lines.
This is because if the plaintext is 7 bits you can send
just the 7 bits after the XOR.  Even more general you can
use it to encrypt any size at a time, down to single bits
if you just have 1 bit to send immediately and dont want
to wait for more data to become applicable.
Ok.  So what are its disavantages?  Syncronization, as
soon as synchronization is gone thats it, its all over.  Each
block of 'pad' is generated from previous plaintext,  if you
cant figure out the previous plaintext you are lost.
Notice it uses a hash() function,  this could be anything, ie
DES,  or perhaps a one way function (no unhash() is ever needed).
The algorithm is fairly simple, the beginning is a bit wierd
and could have been done several ways.  The first 8 bits in
this implementation are used for synchronization.
prog -e key file2
prog -d key file3
ok.. here it is..  poke holes in it.  What are the weaknesses,
is it totally unsecure?  Is it as secure as the hash function
(ie. if DES was used, is strength equivalent to the strength of

it is loaded.  In   how do you change keys?  only people who
know how to encrypt for that key can program the thing.  If a
public key scheme was used,  the processor could be built with
a private key inside, and you assemble and then encode in the
public key,  only the processor (and whoever else has the private key) can check the code.  Quite a bit of complexity, also how do you do encryption in small enough units for the
cpu to use?  How do you decrypt w/ random access any part
of the data?  If you choose too large blocks (ie. cache) how
do you keep enemy programs from grabbig already decrypted data?
obviously some data must go out as plaintext (for I/O)  then
you have to keep track of which data is to always remain crypted
and which needs to go to plaintext..   wow..  what a nightmare.
I think its probably possible...

I think a good idea for offline readers would be to build ontop of
currently implemented protocols.  One protocol worth mentioning is
IMAP2.  Right now IMAP2 usually runs over TCP but there is no reason
why it couldn't run over a serial channel instead (SIMAP :)
It allows for remote access to mailboxes from a mail server, and also
remote access to builitin-board messages (ie. USENET).  There are
several packages in development or already in use that use IMAP.
PINE for unix's and soon to be available for DOS machines supports
IMAP access.  PINE also supports MIME and could be extended nicely
to handle automatic PGP encryption/decryption of mail (or en/de-
cryption with other crypto-systems).  Macintosh already has a mailer
supporting IMAP, the name eludes me at the moment.   The mailers
in existence are written for TCP and would have to be modified for
use over the serial line, perhaps with a pseudo-packet driver in
the dos case.  I think this type of solution would be much cheaper
and much more feature filled than starting from scratch.

We need to get people to use common protocols!  CI$ will respond to what its users want.
If we got alot of BBS's to use IMAP then the users would
want CI$ to use the same.
If we made IMAP easy to use and helped BBS authors
get IMAP code running in their systems then BBS users would
use it
PINE is very easy to use.  It will be available soon for personal
computers to use.  That part of the solution is almost there.
How do we get BBS's to use IMAP?  they could support IMAP in
a similar way that they support Zmodem.  What needs to be done
is to write some code that does IMAPD functions that could easily
be incorporated into a BBS program, and figure out a way for
end users to run PINE from their favorite bbs program.
(and get PINE people to allow for a serial-line connection *or*
write a false-packet driver that just strips off TCP/IP headers
sends the data over the line and sends back ACK's to the TCP/IP

No fixation.  Just that IMAP is the best protocol for remote mail reading and pine is already available and supporting IMAP.  And
as a bonus it supports MIME.  This *is* something that BBS'ers dont
already have..  multi-media mail.
You dont need encrypted TCP/IP!  A good mail reader supporting MIME
could handle encryption packages automatically!  MIME also supports
many other things that "they do not already have".
I dont think its easier.  I think something like SLIMAP (serial line
imap) would be the easist thing to implement.  IMAP runs over a network
stream and there is no reason it couldnt run over a serial line stream.
The code written for imapd already runs on stdin/stdout...  It wouldnt
be hard to port to run on a serial line connection.
I dont think offering IP to the masses is the right solution right
now.  Its not appropriate for the BBS world.  Getting people to use
remote mail clients is something that the masses could take to
alot easier.  I think this would be the prefered way to read mail
since the user interface could be made more friendly,  sorta
the 'prodigy thang'.  I dont think it matters what protocol is used
in the end but I think its something that should happen, and something
that we as cypherpunks have an interest in seeing happen.

This is the basic structure of DES (if I didnt make a mistake, this
is from memory).  Anyway the basic idea is you take half the key
(called L and R for Left and Right, but hey, I'm lysdexic).  You
put it through an expansion, this just mixes up the order of the
bits and duplicates a few of them.  Then you XOR it with the sub-key
(the Key Generator is not shown).  Then you split it up into 8 6-bit
chunks and do a table lookup in the S-boxes, each Sbox has 6 inputs
and 4 outputs.  Then you re-arrange the bits in the P permutation.
Finally you XOR that value with the L to get next R, and put the
pre-XOR'ed value into the next L.
This is 1 iteration and is done 16 times in DES, and 16*25 times in
crypt(3).  Crypt(3) also has the salt values which cause the swapping
of two bits in the E expansion for every salt bit that is set.  Before
pulling apart the 64 bit input into 2 32 bit halfs (L and R) the data
is passed through an Initial Permutation (IP), and at the end of the
whole thing passed through (IP^-1) its inverse (this permutation isnt
cryptographically that significant).  The subkeys are generated
by taking the input 56 bits of key, mixing them up and then successively
rotating those bits, and passing them through a permutation.  It outputs
48 bits of key each iteration to match the 48 bits after the E expansion.
I hope I didnt make too many mistakes in the above discussion, but
you get the general idea.

@_subject: Secure comm program, Sockets + LINK 
I assume you're talking about the link program I wrote.
If so:   I never really considered the RSA exchange as authentication
although it can be thought of that way I guess.  The reason for
the RSA part was primarily to exchange a private session key.  Only
one side initiates the key exchange because of a flaw in the implementation right now (if both send key exchange messages at the
exact same time, both ends will end up using different keys).
Even though only one end sends a message, both ends must "match up"
in that they must both have 1/2 of the RSA key (the "encryption"
and "decryption" or "public" and "private" keys).  Hence if they
end up with the same session key you can consider it a match and
hence a sort of authentication I guess.
If (when) I implement DH key exchange I guess I should add some
sort of authentication.
I would like to put DH exchange in but I havent seen (or really looked that hard :) for good DH source.  Anyone know of a fast
implementation that is public domain (or that I have permission
to use) and preferably available outside of the USA already?

This is a matter of perspective.  You are thinking of the matching
keys as being 'public' and 'private'.  You can also think of them
both being half of a key, both being unknown to any third parties.
In such a case the mere possession of a matching key is a type of
authentication.   This because you only gave out one half to a
specific person in a private way, and you kept the other half for
This is half way true in the sense of my link program but not
totally true, because both halves were generated on one machine
and one half transmitted (probably over an insecure channel) to
the remote.  This second key is secure in that it only got transfered
once and then exists in only one place that may be secure.  It is
insecure in that it might have been observed in that window of
vulnerability.  Why is it that you want both sides to authenticate, btw?
In the case of a human<->human connection?
I can definitely add authentication (two way).

I will post here after I clean up and test
the code a little and get it ready for "release".
So if you're interested, basically just wait.
But I am looking for people who are willing

should need no porting, what needs to be done
really is to find a good P.D. term program in
source form and modify it (this is what I have

serial with encoding/decoding routines and
then outputting the results,  and small things
like providing the user a way to turn on

that would allow for "fun" use of digital cash systems while allowing a platform to test out ideas and put the system into
a somewhat "real" environment.
  All that is needed for a digital cash environment is a way
to earn money and a way to spend money.  The ideas proposed
so far seemed to be "send me real money and we'll give you
credits."   How about putting the digital money in a game/bbs
environment?  Example:  mud's could allow people to transfer
their funds between different games,  to give away some of
their game money electronically to others, etc.  BBS's might
let you spend your digital cash earned from a MUD for more
time or other services.  Maybe they'll let you earn money from
them in special ways.  A bank could be set up, and fixed sized
donations could be sent out to each service (BBS, MUD, etc)
participating.  Each service could then award its participants
with earnings as they play.    How could something like this actually come about?  Banking
routines for transfer of funds would have to be written
in portable code,  with an easy interface for software authors
to use in their packages.  Most people running BBS's, MUD's
and other services on the net have the technical knowledge
to patch something this simple into their programs.
  I am not a big fan of MUD's, and hardly BBS around, but
I think this might be a good way to get a system up and
running.  This will enable flaws in the system to surface,
and even under very bad circumstances, no one loses real

@_subject: tripple des 
Crypto question:
why was the following chosen for tripple DES :
   EN(DE(EN(data,k1),k2),k3);   The encryption would involve passing data through IP,
then doing 16 rounds forward with k1,
(factoring out the IP-1 and IP)
then doing 16 rounds backwards with k2
(factoring out the next IP-1 and IP)
then doing 16 rounds forward with k3
then going through IP-1
How would this compare with
   EN(EN(EN(data,k1),k2),k3);
which goes through IP,  does 16 rounds each with k1, k2 then
k3, then IP-1 ?
The only difference is that the key scheduler rotates backwards
(or another interpretation keys used in reverse order) for the
second stage.
Does anyone know the rationale behind this?

Hi ,  I was reading through some books at the library the other day
and came across this,  has anyone given any thought to implementing
this scheme?
   Matrix Extensions of the RSA Algorithm
   Chih-Chwen Chuang and James George Dunham
   CRYPTO '90 , page 140.
They suggest a matrix extension of the RSA algorithm which uses
much less computation time.  They go on to prove that the security
of the system is equivalent to RSA and the hash function used:
"Under a chosen plaintext attack on the key, the securityof the
new algorithm is equivalent to that of the RSA algorithm.  Under
a known plaintext attack on themessage, the security of the system
rests upon that of the one-way function."
Sounds like something worth looking into , as computation times
are *much* faster than that of normal RSA.

The biggest problem is CPU power.  The compression schemes that work
best are very computationally expensive.  Add to that the fact that
you need to do simultaneous encryption and compression, and if you
want full duplex make that simultaneous encryption, decryption,
compression and decompression.   You also have to send it over the
modem, and probably frame it too.
I'm currently implementing one scheme (LPC) on a DSP chip.  Hopefully
my end product will be <$50.  I plan put its own ADC/DAC chip on
board (to save computer<->DSP bandwidth).  Possibly some
high end CPU's like 486 and 040 could handle the load, but
wouldnt leave much cpu for anything else.

If this is so it couldnt do any computations itself.  Somoene
mentioned Xyxel's modems will do CELP in and of themselves.
There is no doubt that the CPU can handle the encrypion +
framing, this is what I plan to do.
I am using the ADSP2105 from Analog Devices.  The list price
is about $12.  It has internal memory (1 kwords instruction,
512 words data,  24 and 16 bits wide respectively), and
boots instruction memory off of an eeprom.  Minimum setup
would probably be ADSP2105, xtal, eeprom (4k), max232 (interface voltage levels), DAC/ADC chip and a power supply.

The number is transmitted in ascii at 1200 bits per second.  The
standard used to transmit the data is not the "normal" 1200 bps
mode of your modem.  Normally 1200 bps is accomplished by sending
300 symbols per second where each symbol conveys 4 bits of information.
The caller ID info is transmitted at 1200 bps by sending 1200 symbols
per second where one symbol conveys 1 bit of information.  The method
used is FSK,  one frequency is sent for a 1 bit, and another for
a zero bit.  I dont have the frequencies on me, but if you are really interested I can get them to you later.

data is most usually stored in a way that makes sense on the underlying
hardware, ie 24 bit palette.  Why 24? because it is 3 bytes per pixel,
one byte for R,G and B.  R G and B arent even weighted the same perceptually!
Why should they have the same amount of bits? Because it makes sense on
the machine!
Not everyone is trying to squeeze every last "bit" of performance,
take for example crystal clear fone lines over fiber optic connections
with extra noise added in to sooth the listener.
I'm not familiar with oversampling in CD players but where I am familiar
with anti-aliasing is in cases where it is easier to do anti-aliasing
filtering digitally than it is to do it with analog circuitry.  Maybe
you can tell me why there are 64 times oversampling playres.
The compression in these mini-discs is more of a coding scheme than
a compression I believe.  It eliminates elements in the sound that
are perceptually unimportant to the listener.

@_subject: DC-Net proposal,  comments requested 
Dining Cryptographer's (DC) net built on top of TCP/IP.
   To explore the problems in implementing a useable DC net.     The Net would allow connections to a PAD machine,  the PAD machine
   would be used to establish a "connection" across the DC-Net to
   another PAD machine which would then allow an outgoing TCP connection.
   The connection through the DC-NET would be transparent and untraceable.
   Machines that are part of the DC-NET could talk to each other    untraceably through the network.
   This net would allow a user to set up an 'untraceable' connection
from one point on the internet to another.  The NET would be made
up of one or more actual DC-Nets.  A DC-NET
   This net is broadcast in nature (data written by one machine can be
seen by all other machines on the network) but with the characteristic that it is impossible to tell which machine on a particular DC-Net wrote out the data (except if all other machines are controlled by the same person?).  The DC-NET itself is bit oriented.  Such a DC-network would
be the underlying layer for the packet network.  The actual DC-Network
would be made up of processes on various (or even the same,  for testing purposes) machines all connected together with TCP.  The Packet Net
   The Packet Network would be built with the DC-Net as a base.  In order
to send useful information across the network a single node would form
data into packets.  These packets would be outputted to the network a
bit at a time.  Since the DC-Net is bit oriented it is possible for
another node to send some bits after one node has started to write out
its packets.  As a node writes out a packet it should listen to the
network for "collisions" and if a collision is detected it would "give up" on the current transmission and wait for some time to start
again.  Packets from one machine to another must have some sort of
addressing.  The packet could be encrypted entirely in the public
key of the destination if there is only a single DC net.  If there
are multiple DC-Nets with packet forwarding between them then there
must be some sort of plaintext address information in the packets.
The return address should *never* be in plaintext.  Probably the
data and return address of a packet would be encrypted in the public
key of the destination or in a private key shared with the destination.
  Virtual connections can be built on top of the packet network in
the same way as they are on top of other packet networks.  Some protocol
like TCP (or even the TCP protocol) could be used.
Why should this be built on the internet?
    Writting and debugging a network of this sort on top of the internet
should be easier than writing it and implementing it from scratch.  Some
people have proposed neighborhood networks that would be used to
implement untraceable and unstoppable connections.  This is an excellent
way to develop and debug such a network.
What needs to be resolved
   Alot!  This is just something I threw together.  There are alot of
   questions.  In fact most of it is still a question.  The protocol
   of the underlying DC-Net needs to be written.  A packet layer must
   be written or adapted from current protocols.  The issues of addressing
   need to be addressed.  There are also sure to be alot of politically
   oriented questions as well.

Anon Said:
I would love to see this happen.  The programs I have written (Circ and link) are currently using an implementation of RSA
I grabbed off of the ghost site in italy.  It is slow and the
interface is poor.  I would love to have a library of routines
that will use PGP key files,  use PGP random number generation
etc.  It would also be nice if this library allowed access to the
math primatives as well, for implementing other schemes not
in the library like DH (which maybe should be part of the library).
Alls that needs be done is to rip out all the crypto routines, the
random number routines and the key management routines and placing
them in seperate modules.   PGP could be rewritten with this
new structure which would probably make it alot easier to manage
and find bugs in (due to modularity).  This would also ease
recofinguring PGP to do other encryptions (like triple DES).
The PGP command interface would just be a front end, and graphical
front ends could access internals directly instead of hacking
around the normal PGP front end.

What we need most of all is an interface.  This is basically what
you are proposing.  Since tcl add-ons are usually written in C
I think it would be best off to start with a C library calling interface.
Once this is made, you could build a tcl shell (or a wish shell) on
top of it.  I expressed what I would like to see in a C library
interface a few days ago.  It would be based on PGP routines and
the PGP "shell" would be re-implemented over it.  I have gotten
no feedback on the idea at all.  Are there any members of the PGP

This is an idea I really would like to see done, and which would

purpose: to make routines implemented and implemented well within
the PGP program available to programmers.
future purpose: to make a general purpose library of routines
helpful in implementing various crypto systems and protocols.
plan:  Take the PGP source and rip it apart into tiny pieces
and put it back together in an organized way.  Change the
Makefile structure to build various libraries and isolate
the main user interface routines into a seperate group of
files.  Basically a restructuring of PGP that will provide
various intermediate libraries that may be used by other programers
for linking within their program.
*IF* this becomes part of the standard PGP distribution all
non-portable code will be rewritten for various platforms and
you will be able to find a lib for just about any platform
you are coding or porting to.
I havent read through the PGP code myself, but I suggest
at least libraries for the random number routines (including
the system-specific keyboard routines for getting random
seeds), a library for the RSA and IDEA routines, and a library
of the lower-than-RSA math routines.
After this is done then various projects such as a tcl shell
can be written on top of the libraries.
If the library is successful then various additions can be made
to it to make it a true crypto library rather than just a
PGP library.  This could also benefit PGP if it is changed
to allow various crypto systems.
The benefits of this approach are many:  When implementing
PGP front ends you usually dont want the normal PGP front
end at all, and would rather just re-write your own on
top of the PGP code.  When you are coding simple crypto
libraries (like 'link' and 'Circ') it is nice to have a
drop-in cryptosystem library.  The advantages to import-
export are nice as well, you can write code that has no
crypto code in it at all and let the users grab the crypto
library to compile.
