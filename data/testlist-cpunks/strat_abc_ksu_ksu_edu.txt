@_subject: The need for FREE cryptography ... 
There is still a void in the arena of free public encryption systems for
regular human beings.  It would be wonderful if somebody would put a
reasonably secure package (much like PGP) and copyleft the source.  PGP has
never been a very useful tool to me as a programmer because of its internal
structure.  What I'd need, if I wanted to integrate this technology into
new platforms such as voice communication or an encrypted file system, is a
library of tools for shuffling this data around and piping it through the
"magic" algorithms.
I wonder if somebody on this list could outline what efforts are being made
in this area.
