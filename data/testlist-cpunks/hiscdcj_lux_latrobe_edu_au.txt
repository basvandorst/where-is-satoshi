Oceania is, but we may be able to set up the network soon, with a bit of

I may be able to. As in, I have a TCP/IP access and a very large

I've been told that any software I want to run I can install it myself,
so I _guess_ this means I could run a mailing list......

Sure, the masses wouldn't do it, but how many are needed?
How many users are thereb on the net, compared to how many sites?
All it would take is a dozen or so people in each city, and itt could be done. Don't know about intercity stuff, though.
A friend of mine is putting together some ideas regarding what he calls
'punknet', using a bundle of small, solar-powered relays, maybe microwave
links, or infra-red, or short-distance packet radio, whcih could
be manufactured in bulk and stuck all over a city, disguised as bits of
construction, ettc, so tthey would be hard to see, acting as switching devices
so that we could have a completely open and untraceable network within a city.
Serves me right for not reading through the message first. Yes, this is what
my friend was thinking of.

@_subject: distributed autonomous networks 
Hi guys,
   well, after reading through the backlog of spread spectrum stuff, I was
surprised to read about the radio-network-on-a-board (Julieboard) article
that someone posted. A couple of us here in Australia have been kicking
around the idea of a cheap network, running via repeaters in _very_
small boxes tossed all around a city, which would be indestructible through
sheer numbers (a la the arpanet).
   So: anyone got any ideas, schematics, information?
The main idea is a huge number of small, low-power and CHEAP nodes which
would handle through traffic which anyone with a radio modem could tap into,
with the nodes disguised and placed in extremely hard to get to places (tops
of telephone poles, buildings, on bridges and overpasses, etc).
   This would mean that it would cost an awful lot of money to remove each of these things, IF they could be found.
Possible power sources: batteries (but they need to be changed)
                        solar power (Australia leads the world in solar power
                                     technology, and I know people who know
                                     people).
                         Near Field Interaction and EMF pickups (stick 'em
                            near high-frequency power transmission lines).
                         Something that convert heat to electrical energy
       or combinations of all of the above.
The idea being that we would have an untraceable, unbreakable network. Sure,
you may have an address (perhaps we could set it up as a FQDN domain?), but
that address would not correspond to any actual physical location. And, it
would be free, aside from the cost of the equipment. No more phone calls
to pay for!
I have no idea how this could be done across interstate or international distances, but I'm sure people might have ideas. Bounce signals off
satellites (are those big shiny things from the 50's still about?); send
stuff encrypted via the internet, etc etc.
This could well mean that we would have a truly private network, with strong encryption and no centralised source of transmission (I mean, most
of the internet traffic into and from Australia goes via a single link, so far as I know).

Are these particularly common? Or only when there are meteor showers...
Right. what sort of computer? Would it be possible to run this sort
of setup from an 8088? They are pretty cheap at the moment.
Ahh. Well, I'll have to look into it.

Could an 8088 do this? (he says, having just asked this in a previous The thing would be to do it via as cheap and readily availabe a chip as is Erp. Right. Hmmm. I just thought it wuld be kind of nice to have an internet
address for some of the nodes, so we can mail to and from the internet,
while preserving the geographical invisibility that punknet would provide.

Hmm, not much use unless you had some sort of massivley parallel setup.
Still, it's an idea.
Yes, but I assume that we are talking about moving a bit more data than this.
I don't think the Powers That Be will get _that_ heavy...  :-)

That is why we try to make them as cheaply as possible. Then if they
are hard to get hold of (hidden/camouflaged/stuck up cliffs and flagpoles)
the cost to retrieve them will be prohibitively high.
Errrrr. Hadn't thought of that. Placement will be a major factor, I
Depends how you place them. If you put them _on top_ of things, you'd need a helicopter to shoot 'em.
This is true.
But if we make the things in thick boxes (well, slightly bullet-proof,
anyway), and put them in places where theyare hard to shoot at, then we should be right. We would only need a few each suburb.

Yeah, they are useful. I got on this list only a couple of months ago, so
I am sure I have missed a lot.
This is what I thought. If they are made so that they are self-powering,
and tuned via crystals, there is no reason why we couldn't have them
mass-produced wherever the hell they are cheapest to manufacture, as part of a big world-wide single order. My friend over here suggested
we  get
in touch with the ham radio set, plus the bbs scene. The more the merrier,
I say.
The advantage of crystals, or at least a tunable set, is that we can then tune them to whetever local frequency is appropriate...
Well, the smaller the better, I think. Ideally they'd be match box or cigarette packet sized, or smaller. But I have no idea how big the julieboard
Phone lines are underground, here. Power lines aren't, though  :-)
The EMF isea IS practical. Apprently they have things in the train stations which induce a hum in a loop in a hearing aid so blind people can navigate
the platforms. This is in the undergroun stations in central melbourne.
I know nothing about EMF, but my freind does, and he think it's practicable.
I don't know about the heat-to-power idea, and neither does he, he's just
heard of it.
This is what I thought. I thought of using IR lasers for the net-to-Internet
link. What sort of traffic can an IR laser carry, and how cheap are they?
Is this sort of stuff easily done?
Well, the idea behind this is that even if the authorities DID frown on
the whole thing, there is nothing they can do about it. there is no centralised switching mechanism, just lots of cheap nodes scattered (and
hidden) all over the place. The concept of ARPAnet as an uninterruptible net
was what set me off on this track. Even if they could find the nodes, we
just put more up. they could jam the links, but if we make them so that
we can remotely change the frequncy, or use spread-spectrum tech, then
what can they do?  The radio direction finding bunch in the government
here has been shut down due to cost-cutting  so there is bugger
all that could be done to stop it, in this country at least.
If we make the whole thing into suburban cells, and run each cell on a different frequency, then it wuld be impossible to jam the network.
Well, there is one over here, so i'll co-ordinate it if people are interested. People can mail me directly, and in a couple of weeks I'll have my own UUCP site so I can set up a maling list if the traffic gets too big.
I think this is a very good idea. Sure, we can encrypt our data, but we are still transmitting it over =someone else's net=
So, let's build our own!

I've been discussing this with my friend who came up with the idea,
and he said that if anyone wants to discuss this whole concept with him,
feel free, he just doesn't have a huge mailbox, so he hasn't subscribed
to the list.  His address is:
      jon at werple.apana.org.au
mention 'punk.net'  which is his term for the concept. I prefer it to
the current subject of 'spread spectrum nets' or whatever is the
current vogue.
Also, anyone know how to set up aliases under elm? Or is the list in
general happy with this discussion taking place under the aegis of
cypherpunks at toad.com ????
I'd set up an alias file under elm to handle this, and then we could
boot off cypherpunk (maybe post a weekly digest or something) but the
man page for elm is missing on this site  (derrr...)

re the proposed policy:
I read mail offline, usually. The mailer I use, an ms-dos mailer,

I can't get it to work. I sometimes reply online, a I am doing now.
  If I reply online, I can sign messages, I think, using elm. Although I
have no idea at all how to do this, but I'm sure I can find out.
However, if I use my offline mailer, my mail will be delayed.

something urgent, wrote a reply, and uploaded it immediately?
Anyone else in this situation?
