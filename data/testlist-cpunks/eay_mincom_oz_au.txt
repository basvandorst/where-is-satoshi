@_subject: SSLeay - Whats the story... 
I started writting the library back at the start or april.
It has been available for ftp for a month or 2 now but I'm still working on it.  I have only mentioned it on a few mailing lists and am holding off its anouncment on sci.crypt until we have the windows 3.1 DLL working fully (well, we have it working now but I'm still cleaning things up a bit :-).  It even compiles under DOS :-)
It is a free (for comercial and non-comercial use) complete implementation of netscapes SSL v 2.  The SSL part of the library is quite small, most of the rest is support routines for the x509 environment. I have routines for DES (my libdes library), RC4, IDEA, RSA, MD2, MD5.  I have support routines to generate RSA private keys and I have programs to generate, and certify x509 certificates.
Tim Hudson has put SSL in ftp, telnet, Moasic, httpd etc.  These patches are available from the same ftp site.
For those in the USA, you can build to use RSAref and can build with RC4 and or IDEA removed.
All code in this 'library' has been written by me from publicaly available material.  Documentation of the non SSL part is quite small since I have mostly been coding and nearly all of this work has been done outside of my normal work hours.
People have been using the library quite a bit, and we can interoperate with netscape secure servers and their clients (if we have a certificate signed by netscape).
Have a play and please send me any comments :-)

Do you have a copy of this?
Totaly agree, hell, I going to give the option for users and server to specify at run time which ciphers never to use :-).
The clear text I don't like, I agree.  But then when used for http, everything begins with a GET anyway.  The CRL verification is again to me a matter of implementation.  Currently my library does not support CRL (but I can load and manipulate them).  It is simply a function of the infrastructure to go with the library.  SSL v3 of the spec does alow for CRL to be passed along with the certificate heigherachy (a PKCS-7 object).
I'm mostly concered with any objections raised with the protocol, not the particular implementation around right now.  With my library I fully intend to make it possible to refuse to authenticate the server unless a current CRL is present.
Anyway, I'm intersted in hearing people complains so I can attempt to make sure none of the fixable problems are in my library :-)

@_subject: Doing the SSL challenge 
Boy, go away for a weeks holidays and every-one else has all the fun :-).
Just a few quick ramble about my searching of the top half of the key space in the first SSL challenge, please ignore if you are sick of this All these estimates of the cost in CPU time are a bit silly.  I started out using a few of our bigger machines at work but when people noticed I just stoped using them.  My main workhorse machines became desktop boxes that nobody used at night.  Quite a bit of my %50 keyspace was done by 5 dual processor sparc 20's that people around me had on their desktops.  Most of the rest was done by about 50 486's that I rsh'ed to each night (I just tried to rsh to every Solaris/x86 box in the company :-).  Out of a company of about 300 people, about 2 (who did not know about my attempt on the challenge) asked me about this processing and what was I actually doing, no-one else really noticed :-).
I was making no particular effort to use every machine I could but I was still able to do about %2.5 of the key space each 12 hour night and %12.5 each weekend.  If I made a real effort to harness the compute power at my work I would have probably been able to run at twice this rate but that would have required work on my part, alot more people would have noticed and it would have had an impact on people doing real work.  The way I was seaching had no impact.
I will also say that screen-savers running on the above mentioned 486's were a real pain, perhaps we will change xlock so they can only run the blank screen :-).
I personally feel that using mas-pars is cheating a bit :-).  People are aware that something is going on when a machine that big is grunting away all weekend :-).  There is so much CPU sitting on people's desktops that is just unused that there is very little need to use the big central boxes.
The relative speed on some of the machines I used is as follows (per CPU is in brackets)
6 CPU SGI challenge	37 (6.1)  5 (1.6)
2 CPU sparc 20		7  (3.5)  1 1 CPU 486 DX50		1
I could never realy get more that 1/2 the SGI but I could always get 5 sparc 20's and 50+ 486's without anyone noticing.
So I was getting the 2.5 6CPU SGI challenge's from idle machines on people desks.

Yes, this is all quite silly.  For my part, I've implemented SSL on my work machines (in my own time) and released it under my own copyright
and my boses don't mind (mind you, I'm not trying to make money from the code).  I've participated in trying to break the 40bit key on work machines (using only idle machines) and they don't mind.  I've run network raytracing programs (using only idle machines) and they don't mind.  Most places of work give employees quite a bit of lattitude as long as they don't do things that reflect badly on the company and if it generates publicity that is positive they don't mind.  If Joe Bloggs who works at Widgets Inc get's mentioned in the paper, thats free publicity for Widgets Inc and indicates that Widgets Inc may have some-one with some brain cells working for them (depending if they call Joe Bloggs an 'evil hacker' or not :-).

@_subject: Crypto DLL's/SSLeay 0.4.5 
Just in case people are interested, I've put the most recent version of my SSL (SSLeay) library up on ftp://ftp.psy.uq.oz.au/pub/Crypto/SSL/
The big differece with this realease is that it builds under Windows 3.1.
The DLL's for the libraries are there as well as the ported demo programs.
I've used Borland C 4.0 and the .IDE file plus source code are in the The DLL's contain routines for MD2, MD5, RC4, DES (every mode you could want :-), IDEA, RSA, SSL and all the X509 etc stuff that is part of life with SSL.  The library even compiled under MSDOS :-).
Since my code base will always be unix first, the code is not optimised for 16bit and probably never will be, but still, the algorithms work and the code is free for comercial and non-comercial use.  The applications need work to make them nice under Windows, but hell, I'm only writing a library :-).
On the PGPphone issue, I Personally I feel SSLphone would be a much better way of doing things.  If some-one has a 'voice' over modem program already, they should be able to slip SSL into it in only a few days.
For phone over modem, authentication is not really required and what exists in my library is everything required for the encryption side of those URL's again

:-) Agreed, it depends on how you use SSL and implement it, I have not added it yet but I'll put in my library hooks so an application can refuse to use certain ciphers that are in the library.  Currently you can specify your preference of cipher and there is a call to return the cipher being used on an SSL connection.  The most recent version of SSLtelnet of ours prints the subject name of the server and the cipher being used, just so you can know if you are using RC4-40 :-).
As for authentication, agreed, the key distribution problem for X509 needs work but still, if the audio is good enough, you should know who is on the other end :-).
none taken, my main support for SSL is that there is minimal work to be done to make an application support encryption (+ perhaps authentication) over a connection.  This means that any work done to improve the SSL library (as in certificate distribution and verification) will instantly be able to be added to all applications using that SSL library.  If each one of 15 different appliction has a different cipher/authentication package, there is 15 times the work to upgrade.
Hell, to put PGP type authentication in SSL would probably not be very hard.
It would require a new certificate type and a new 'verify certificate' routine and that would be about it.
Basically I'm a bit lazy, I like to write libraries and then keep on reusing them.
Again, if the voice is clean enough, you should know who is at the other end.
If you are talking about a program being at the other end, well thats another matter :-).

@_subject: Timing Cryptanalysis Attack 
Read the SKIP spec (SKIP is Sun's IP level encryption protocol).  It uses
Diffle-Hellman certificates.  That means fixed secret DH keys being used
in routers.  It is hard to thing of a better target for this type of
attack.  I have not done a complete read of the SKIP specification (only a
quick scan) so I could be wrong about SKIP but DH certificates sound like
a very very bad idea.  The other source for attack would be any networked
service that is on a local network.  Single user machines are far better
targes than multi-user systems.  That Web server sitting idle not doing
much, repeatedly hit it with https requests and if you are on a local
network, you should be able to get very good timing information. I for one will probably add a flag for conditional compilation of my bignumber library so that it will take constant time.  This may be a %10 slow down (using small windows exponentiation) which is trivial compared to the %30 speedup I will probably get when I implement a faster mod function :-).

Well lets put it this way, people have hacked machines through firewalls
via IP spoofing, broken a single SSL RC4-40 bit session after weeks of CPU
time, are you saying that perhaps being able to break a fixed
Diffie-Hellman key on a central router/computer would not be worth trying. Remember, if you broke this key, and had recorded the last 6 months worth
of traffic, you can now decode all of this traffic.  Once you have that
secret key and those packet logs, the decoding is a trivial and mechanical
process (trust me on this one).  One of the major advantages of choosing a
new secret key per HD negotiation is that you loose this capacity to
decrypt previous and future sessions. When we talk about taking 100s of
years to factor large primes, a system that may work after a month or 2 of
collecting data and statistics is definatly an easier proposition,
especially when the reward is all past and future traffic. Eric Young                  | Signature removed since it was generating

Granted.  For my particular library, there are no major 'if statements' I believe (I'll check) after you get out of the mod_exp function and into the mod and mul sub parts.  As for the multiplier, I just had a look at my old 386 book and yup, it does take an argument dependent time... I've been around pipelined RISC cpus too long...

SSLeay 0.5.1 is now available.
It should be quite stable and has documentation for the lower level
cryptographic routines.
It is incompatible with the previous version but has no global variables
of consequence so it should be a much nicer starting point for threaded
libraries.  The library should have no memory leaks and the general
cryptographic functionality has been filled out more.
Tim Hudson  will be updating the applications
available on ftp.psy.uq.oz.au in the next few days.
I leave for an 11 week holiday today so please address any problems and
questions to the ssl-users at mincom.oz.au mailing list (if it is of
general interest) or to ssleay at mincom.oz.au which goes to both
myself and Tim Hudson (who will be fixing any bugs while I'm away).
Anouncing software and then leaving for 3 months would probably not
normally be considered a good practice but 0.5.0 has been tested for
the last week or so and I have faith in Tim Hudson's ability to fix bugs after doing pre-alpha testing for the last 6 months :-)

To install this package, read the INSTALL file.
This library has been compiled and tested on Solaris 2.[34] (sparc and x86),
SunOS 4.1.3, DGUX, OSF1 Alpha, HPUX 9, AIX 3.5(?), IRIX 5.[23],
LINUX, NeXT (intel). For people in the USA, it is possible to compile SSLeay to use RSA
Inc.'s public key library, RSAref.  From my understanding, it is
claimed by RSA inc. to be illegal to use my public key routines inside the USA.
Read doc/RSAref.doc on how to build with RSAref.
Read the documentation in the doc directory.  It is quite rough,
but it lists the functions, you will probably have to look at
the code to work out how to used them.  I will be working on
documentation.  Look at the example programs.
There should be a SSL reference manual which is being put together by
Tim Hudson (tjh at mincom.oz.au) in the same location as this
distribution.  This contains a lot more information that is very
useful.  For a description of X509 Certificates, their use, and
certification, read rfc1421, rfc1422, rfc1423 and rfc1424.  ssl/README
also goes over the mechanism.

This library is reasonable stable now.  Version 0.5 has had extensive
rewriting since version 0.4.  The purify package has been used extensively
and I believe most if not all memory leaks have been removed.
There are no writable global variable so a multi-threaded/DLL version of
the library should be quite simple to write.
Look at TODO for a list of thinks I know I still need to do.

I was the person who put the encryption back into that version of kerberos (which is now called eBones).  They removed all encryption calls.
They had actually pulled out all calls to the des routines, so we had a 'working' authentication system that encrypted nothing.
This version was called Bones (they ran a program called parania over Kerberos, and that left Bones :-).  When I left, we had Kerberos working but I had not tested against 'true' kerberos.  I belive it has been fixed by 'those that have followed' and now fully interoperates with MIT kerberos v4.  So the 'international' version of kerberos is fully legal.
BTW I wrote libdes (my DES library) as part of this work.  Luckily I have     escaped from Kerberos/eBones when I left Bond Uni but my nights are
    still haunted with memories of trying to follow the code :-).

I too have though about this question.  While I write crypto code and know
some areas quite well, I also seem to be blessed with the ability to
displaying my total ignorance in other areas in very public forums.  Since
I have no professional reputation to protect (I don't work in the
crypto field) and don't really have any 'aspirations to become an
authority', I feel I can do this so long as I also make
an effort to answer the question in the area of my expertise and to
also share the information I gain.
The difference between ignorance and stupidity is that one decreases with time :-).

@_subject: 4096 bit strong prime for Diffle-Hellman 
A bit of a ramble about Diffle-Hellman parameters.....
Just for anyone interested, I 'found' a suspected 4096 strong prime (p and
(p-1)/2 are prime) for use with Diffie-Hellman, generator of 2.
If any-one wants for testing the primality, please let
me know if it passes.  I'm currently using the Miller-Rabin primality
test with my own bignum library.
I'm just generating some 'default' DH parameter sets for distribution
with the next version of my crypto library (SSLeay), I'll send out Phil
Karn's 1024 and 2048 bit values and this one if other people are happy
with it.
Some quick times (in seconds) for the use of a 4096 bit prime with DH on a
SGI (200mhz R4400).  The RSA operation is PKCS private key encrypt, the
DH operation is a PKCS public/private key generation followed by the
generation of session key, the maths routines are from SSLeay.
modulus     DH     RSA
 512      0.23   0.041
1024      1.71   0.248
2048     12.88   1.702
4096    102.18  13.150
The RSA times as you will notice are about the same speed for twice the DH
bit size.  This is due to the RSA operation being reduced to 2 a^b%m
operation where m has the values of p and q where (p-1)*(q-1) is the RSA
modulus, half the bit size. The DH operation is 2 a^b%m operations,
(generating the 'public key' and then raising by the peer's public key). Does any-one know of any tricks to speeding the DH operation up (not
counting implementing a better a^b%m function, I'm going to do this later
when I have time :-).  From what I can see, there is not much that can be
done except perhaps some tricks in the initial g^rand%p, since the
generator is a known value. Even if the private DH values are pre-calculated, this will only halve the
time of the DH operation and if this is done it looses the advantage of DH
in that if the private/public pair are 'generated on the fly',
pre-recorded session will not be able to be decoded if the private key is
revealed at a later point in time.  This is the major advantage I can see
of a DH key exchange over the use of an RSA based system so I would object to loosing this feature. With these times I think that 4096 bit DH is not going to be used for
quite a while :-).

Urk, that reads very badly what I ment is that since a different
public/private key is used per session, if a private key is revealed, any
previous and future comunication between the 2 entities is not
compromised, only the particular session using that public/private key pair.
Also since the key pair is generated on the fly, they don't need to be recorded on disk etc, so they only way to get the private key is to 'hack' the application at runtime (or modify it in advance).

Well, I left it running for about 50 hours over last weekend without a hit. Then I restarted it on Monday night and got a hit in about 12 hours :-).
(I thought it has finished sooner but I looked again at the 'script(1)' output and it did take 12 hours).
It is sort of hard to tell how longs things would take, due to the hit or
miss nature of this kind of search for primes. This is on a SGI with a
200mhz R4400 which is about the same speed as a 120mhz pentium when using
my maths libraries.
I'm doing the 'pick' an odd random number 'p', sieve p and (p-1)/2 over
the first 2000 primes, adding in steps until a number passes the sieve.
For a generator of 2, p mod 24 == 11 should be true.
When it passes, then do Miller-Rabin tests on P and (P-1/2) enough times
to be happy that the number is probably a prime :-). I believe that there are improvement that I can put in there for the
initial search for candidate primes
The actuall numbers for the search are as follows, 1057 numbers passed the 'strong prime sieve'. 7 numbers passed the prime test 1 number passed both the prime and strong prime test. I suspect the ratio of 132 cadidates for 'strong' prime testing for each
'prime' could be brought down quite a bit but since I only need strong
primes for DH parameters, I probably will not spend the time on improving
my initial sieve right now. PS, I just 'found' another 2048 bit strong prime last friday night,
2929 numbers passed the 'strong prime sieve'.
29 numbers passed the prime test (101 candidates per hit)
1 number passed both the prime and strong prime test,
4h12m run time.

:-) cute, the next version of SSLeay to be released will have the same thing, good to see great minds think alike (or is that simple minds seldom differ :-).
Currently the interface I will have is
EVP_EncryptInit(EVP_CIPHER_CTX *ctx,EVP_CIPHER *type,unsigned char *key,
void EVP_EncryptUpdate(EVP_CIPHER_CTX *ctx,unsigned char *out,int *outl,
void EVP_EncryptFinal(EVP_CIPHER_CTX *ctx,unsigned char *out,int *outl);
with a string to bytes function,
int EVP_BytesToKey(EVP_CIPHER *type,EVP_MD *md,unsigned char *salt,
this is upward compatable with PKCS and will generate a key and iv of the correct size depending on the EVP_CIPHER for a data string (the lengths are encoded in the EVP_CIPHER definition).
I also have all my Message digest routines using the same type of interface.
What makes this nice is that all my digital signature routines (open, seal, sign, verify etc) all take EVP_CIPHER and EVP_MD arguments so any cipher can be used and any MD can be used.  The ASN1 object identifiers are contained in the EVP_CIPHER/EVP_MD structures.
It also make the 'demo' program that supports all the above mentioned encryption modes (and also does base64 encoding/decoding) only 290 lines long :-).
Now, heres the rub, to use a cipher to encode in pkcs (which is what
S/MIME is using) one needs to have an object identifier (for use in the
ASN1 encoding).  I know of very few object identifiers.

EVP_des_ecb		1 3 14 3 2 6

Can anyone out there fill in the blanks?  I also supose the new version of SHA, SHA-1 will also have a different identifier as well which I will also need.
In the above, I always use 'ede' to refer to encrypt-decrypt-encrypt with 2 keys and 'ede3' to refer to ede with three keys.

@_subject: Cypherpunk Certification Authority 
I'm just making a quick comment on this point.  The current SSLeay setup, I would say no.  You can do it but you need to write more stuff to do it correctly.  It is a bit of an evil cludge.
The next version should be able to do this (I hope, depending on time).
The next version has (will have) several different ways to 'retrieve'
certificates which can be added via an run time API (the application can
'push' new methods into the library during startup). I will probably not
have time to put in a 'socket' based certificate server but it should be
simple enough for this to be written by other people. It should also be
simple enough for other people to write some routines that conform to the
API so that the netscape DB files can be accessed by SSLeay (along with
the current SSLeay 'hash directories' and the socket based lookup (if it
gets put in)). The most importaint change is that I will support CRL if they are present and probably generate an 'warning' if there is no CRL.  I still need to write a simple application to do a basic 'keep track of issued certificates' and generate a CRL if required.  The library routines to write a CA are present, they just need to be glued to a simple database (which I will probably do in my demo case via ascii files in directories).
This version will also hopefully support the concept of selecting a certificate/private key from a set of certificates, attempting to pick a certificate that is in the same 'tree' as another certificate.
This concept of multiple certificates for a person is useful for
SSLtelnet, so that each 'host domain' can issue it's own certificates (and
keep track of it's own CRL).  To let some-one login, just issue them with
a 'certificate' for that 'host domain'. Eric Young                  | Signature removed since it was generating

The one unusual thing is that the CA for /OU=internetMCI/OU=MALL is missing
(the ComerceNet is signed by one of the RSA certificates)
The CommerceNet certificate is only using a 678 bit RSA modulus, the other certificates are either 1000 or 1024 bits long.
If anyone wants the certificates I can send them.

For those that don't know, pkcs7 is used in S/MIME and is a superset of PEM.  The degenerative case of signedData is being used by protocols such as SSLv3 to transport X509 CRL's.

All speeds are in bytes/second.  The DES implementation is a 'standard'
fast DES (there are at least 2 DES packages on the net with this type of
speed) and the IDEA implementation is a 'standard' IDEA implementation
(similar speed to the reference versions) Both written in C.  I have
looked at how I could optimise IDEA but it does not lend it's self to vast
improvements the way DES does.  It may be possible to speed up IDEA by
%20 with good C compilers but that will still only be the speed of DES, I
do not think IDEA should be 'sold' as being faster than DES is software. It is not.  It has over twice the key length (128 vs 56) and that is it's
main benefit.

@_subject: NYT on Netscape Crack 
I will defend Netscapes code on the point about the RNG even though I have not seen any.  I assume the Netscape code is quite large and each release would have to pass various fuctionality tests.  How can you test that the RND seeding is wrong?  You have to actually look at the code, the number coming out are still random.  As of last week I was told by
Mike_Spreitzer.PARC at xerox.com that the random number generator seed routine in my DES library was only copying in 4 bytes of passed data instead of 8.  Given des_cblock data;, it was
it should have been
Rather hard to notice unless you know that des_cblock is passed as a pointer and even this can be compiler dependent.
Now I had not noticed this, my library runs like a charm and things appear random from the random number generator.  This sort of error can only be checked by reading the code and specifically looking at critical routines like this the RNG seeding routines.  The advantage of my code being public is that some-one like Mike can have a look and pick up problems like this.
The moral of the story I suppose is to be paranoid about checking routines relating to RNG.
What would be interesting is to see if packages like PEM use similar simple systems for generating random data.  Any of the systems that do digital envelopes are relying on libraries to provide random data for encryption keys.  At least with the old 'enter passwd' type encryption there was a bit of secret random data coming from a human, pitty about packet watchers seeing those characters as they fly over the net :-)

@_subject: Random Number State 
Some some ramblings on the RNG seeding issue, comments welcome.
I'm sort of in the position of Netscape in that I have an SSL library that needs good random numbers for both RSA key generation (soon DH)
and SSL sessions.
While most of the discussions have been how to generate random data, one solution I will probably follow is that when any 'semi-random' data is generated, make sure to save this for seed data the next time the
application starts.  I have faith in the RNG capabilites of my RNG (based on MD5) and my RAND_seed() routine only 'adds' to the RNG state (about 1k's worth is kept).  I can continue to 'mix' the RNG state at any point in time.  My RND_seed() xors into the existing state, it does not overwrite.
Because my SSL/encryption library contains 'everything', I have the
ability to put calls to my RNG_seed() routine in places like when I decrypt a private key.  I can pass both the password (if the key was encrypted) and the private key into the RNG state (making sure any data that goes into the RNG state can not be determinied if a 'core' file is generated).
I will probably also put the time() into the RNG state whenever an SSL_connect or SSL_accept is made (I think I do already).  I may also put in select data that has been read from the remote host
While most of this data can be determined by watching network activity, if it is just a delta to the initial random state it is somewhat more useful.
The first time use 'x' runs the application they are made to 'generate' some reasonable random data.  For all subsequent executions of the program, any more semi (psuedo?) random data generated can be mixed in with the initial random data.  The profile of the usage of the application would end up determining the random data to use.
I feel it is a bit much to try to generate good random data every time an application is run.
I believe this is the type of aproach PGP uses (I have not looked at the PS  I also do some 'evil' things in that I load 'garbage' bytes from the     stack into my RNG state whenever the RNG is called.  It may not be     random, but I bet it is hard to determine from the outside the     running program :-)  It can only help :-).

@_subject: Please send me SSL problems... 
A few commnets from Tim Hudson who has put SSL into telnet and ftp, he is not on this list but since he is my personal 'put SSL into applications' person (I just write the library :-), I felt his comments would be better than mine :-)
I agree with this statement - application of SSL at the TCP level for all
communication is possible but *not* desirable in the general case - i.e.
for internet communication.
A much better approach (and the one that I have taken for adding SSL into
TELNET and FTP) is to use *existing* negotiation mechanisms for dynamically
switching on SSL for a given link based on determining dynamically if
the server you are connecting to will support it.
Naturally you want options at both the server and the client that enable
you to:
    - fall back to "normal/insecure" mode if SSL is not available
    - drop the connection in the client if SSL is not negotiated
    - drop the connection in the server if SSL is not negotiated
My aim was when adding SSL (in the form of SSLeay) into an existing server
was *always* to be able to run the *one* server for both the "old" and the "new" protocol. I really was getting annoyed at seeing announcements
of yet-another-security package that could be installed that provided another potentially insecure access path into the system that only supported
connecting to it with it's own fixed protocol.
SSL can be seen in it simpliest form as just a nice mechanism for dynamically negotiating a *cipher* - this is how I initially set things
up so that the "normal" authentication mechanisms had to still be used
for connection - i.e. SSLtelnet still required the normal account password
to get access. This has since been "enhanced" so that you can switch on
an option that uses a certificate exchange as the security access mechanism (this is not switched on by default).
For TELNET the "best" place to start seemed to be the work done with
SRATELNET ... it already had all the hooks in the right places for using the RFC-defined TELNET extensions that enabled negotiation of authentication and encryption. (the documentation that came with SRAtelnet
was also nice and clear too).
For FTP there was a similar was of doing things so I used it too ... and
FTP is a *great* example of a protocol where doing things at the TCP
level (tranparently) would be "bad" - it used two ports ... one of which is
usually dynamically allocated ... and you certainly don't want to redo the initial SSL negotiation for each file that you transfer!
(SSLftp reuses the session ID).
Another thing that is worth noting (and worth looking at too) is the
different API offered in SSLREF and SSLeay (... naturally I prefer SSLeay
as I have influence over the author ;-) ... From what I know of the SSLREF
API, it takes the approach of providing wrapper functions that you use
*instead* of the "normal"  functions ... there is (not using the right
names) SSLaccept and SSLconnect that you use that perform the accept() and
connect() along with all the other things required in the SSL protocol
being hidden which sounds nice until you want to do something like FTP ...
where the connection for the DATA socket is formed in the opposite
direction to the CONTROL socket - with SSLeay you do the accept() and
connect() yourself ... as per normal and then run SSL_accept() or
SSL_connect() which does the "logical" SSL stuff ... so in FTP I can do a
connect() and then an SSL_accept() which looks funny but is the "right"
thing to do.  SSLeay has only 2 function calls that operate on socket file descriptors, a singe read() and a single write().  The most recent version will handle non-blocking IO if the application passes a file desciptor with it turned on.  SSLeay does not do a single setsockopt(), ioctl(), fcntl(), accept(), bind(), select() etc. If you haven't looked at SSLeay or looked and the SSL protocol itself then
you really should grab it and have a read (while ignoring the politics   and the WWW hype over SSL).
While there are problems with certificate distribution, this will be overcome.  Ever tried general inter-realm authentication with Kerberos?
Both SSLref and SSLeay interoperate.  From what I know of the SSLref API, our API's are quite different.  Just because SSLref may 'force' you towards a particular style of SSL use does not mean the protocol forces you to use it this way.

Everything needed to implement PEM is there, to do S/MIME I've got to do PKCS-7 but that is just a parsing and packageing problem which I will do (when I get time) for SSL v3. I'm also about to redo my X509_get_certificate routine so that an application can 'push' 'methods' onto the system used to lookup certificates.
I need to be able to look them up via an alias, subject X509 DN, and via Issuer and ID.  If I get time I'll probably put in a demo 'method' that will talk to a socket/host and ask for certificates (proably a simple perl server at the other end).
I'm taking the view that if I can put hooks into the library for other people to put in routines to retrieve certificates/CRL's I will not have to do all the work :-).  I just have to document everything so other people can have a play :-)

Put put it in a word, 'yes'.
This would be a very good system to attack.
Last year during the 'break SSL export' saga, I was able to seach 2^39 of
the key space mostly using networked workstations that were 486DX50's and
sparc 20's.  This took 2 week and basically I ran for 12 hours each night
and no-one at work really knew I was doing this. Well I now have a pentium
100 and they are starting to appear all over the place, they run my code 3
times faster.  This now means that some-one like me, working in a large
software company, if it was fitted out with lots of pentiums would be able
to definitly get your username and password in less than 10 days with
basically no-one knowing that this had been done. Hell, I still have my
software sitting around, it is automated, it would only take me a
month, with no intervention from me until I get the email with the
results. Please remember that I'm not talking about theory.  Besides the person working next to me, no-one at work knew I was participating in the brute force beaking attempt.  Well this is not totally true, the owner of the SGI with 6 R4400 CPU's noticed that I was using a few of the CPU's but they did not know what the programs were doing :-).
I would say that RC4 40 should not be used if possible, especially to do with anything to do with banking.

@_subject: DES as a stream cipher 
Have a look at cipher feed back mode.  I have functions I call cfb64 in my DES library that give a 'single' character interface to cfb mode DES using 64bit feedback.
This should be what you want.  I also have a triple DES version of cfb64.
In my SSL library also has cfb64 mode for IDEA.

@_subject: RC2 speed 
Just a quick RC2 update, since I have not seen anything about it's speed on this list.
I have implemented RC2 from the posting from (This is the 'text' description of the algorithm).
The following times are from C code using gcc 2.7.0 on a sparc 20 and
cc on 'some old slow alpha box'
rc4           4521k/s	3835k/s
des cbc        993k/s	 833k/s
des ede3 cbc   370k/s	 476k/s
idea cbc       862k/s	 726k/s
rc2 cbc        975k/s	1083k/s
Documentation I had seen previously about RC2 made the claim it was about
3 times faster than DES is software.  From my times it appears to be of a
similar speed (depending on the box).  It as has been speculated that RC2
was origionally written for effiecent implementation on 16bit hardware,
this could well be true, but for modern 32bit processors, it appears to
have no real speed advantage over DES or IDEA.
I'm mostly interested in RC2 because it is in the SSLv2 and S-MIME
specifications :-).
Any comments?
PS If RC2 was implemented in assember, it would obviously be faster
   due to direct use of machine rotate instructions.  I don't quite
   know how much this would speed things up but obviously the other
   algorithms would also benifit from hand coding.

@_subject: ASN.1 Tools/Compilers 
SSLeay contains a program asn1parse that will decompose ASN.1 structures.
It also has C routines to play with X509, CRL and certificate requests.
I did not write an ASN.1 compiler, I have written direct C code (using macros).  I decided it would be easier that writing a compiler but it has probably worked out about the same amount of effort.

@_subject: About Triple DES ...... 
I got carried away with adding triple DES to libdes v 3.21+ (listed at
most of the above mentioned sites) back in november.  It has routines for
triple DES in ecb, cbc, cfb64 and ofb64 modes.
The SSLeay package builds a utility called 'enc' which can encrypt/decrypt with optional base64 conversion in any of the above mentioned modes (plus more).  Infact, SSLeay has much nicer higher level 'by parts' finctions for the ciphers that are much easier to use.

@_subject: Edited Edupage, 24 March 1996 
Just a quick comment on the openness of SSL.  I have been able to implement SSL and support routines from internet available documentation.
There is only one part that I have had trouble getting documentation for.  This one part is a 'standard' but the only way I can get it is by either spending lots of money or by getting other people to send me their own online information.
I'm talking about X509/ASN.1.  I still am not sure of the format of the ASN.1 BOOLEAN type, and I have only just been able to get hold of the actual full specification of X509v3.  The UNIVERSALSTRING type?  Only found out about it's existance 3 days ago.
Netscape has not been in anyway an impediment to implementing SSL.
RSA inc and it's software patents are more of an issue.  Mind you, I would not have gotten off the ground if it was not for RSA's PKCS documents.  As some-one who started implementing SSL as a learning exercise with no money to spend, I have learnt to dislike the way some the 'standards' are not available (by which I mean available for the masses via the internet, ala rfc's).
eric (venting some frustration that build up during the just completed
      'quest for the X509v3 spec')

@_subject: Public domain SHA-1 in C 
Some times for this implementation
sha1 over a ~ 6 meg file, sparc 10
user time	5.23s 5.23s 5.14s
Replace your 'getc() into 256 byte buffer' loop with a 'read 16k at a time' (I actually put your functions into my sha1 digest program).
user time	3.79s 3.75s 3.72s
Use sha1 from SSLeay.
user time	2.32s 2.34s 2.24s
Using gcc -O3 -fomit-frame-pointer for all builds and I left out by B_ENDIAN advisory define; all permutations produced the same digest, so the 2 SHA1 implementations conform :-).
The key thing that speeds up the SSLeay sha1 is the avoidance of copying
in the SHA1Update() type function.  Have a look if you like (crypto/sha/sha_dgst.c.  The actually SHA1 digesting on 64 bytes is probably identical.  For most message digests, it appears the bigest problem is shoveling data into the algorithm fast enough.
PS 	The MD2, MD5, SHA1 etc implemented in SSLeay are all stand alone
For those on the cipherpunks list (which I don't frequent any-more), the
current version is SSLeay 0.6.4, it can be built as a shared library under
unix and will build as thread safe DLL's under Windows 3.1/95/NT.  It is thread safe under unix as well (only really tested under Solaris 2.5.1).
