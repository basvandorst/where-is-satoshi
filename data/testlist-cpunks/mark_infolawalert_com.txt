There is a story @
describing how Phil Zimmermann is trying to
retrieve all the rights to PGP from ViaCrypt
in order to jump start his new venture, PGP, Inc.
He's taking a sell out or get sued approach with
ViaCrypt, which until recently has not had much
success marketing PGP.

I'm almost certain that Murray is a consultant rather than
or in addition to an accountant. He's been saying these things
for years at conferences, in papers, on mailing lists, etc.
