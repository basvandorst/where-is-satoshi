An interesting exercise in anonymous and secure email is mixnym. It's
a fun afternoon activity, though the use cases are very thin. It hits
the "all peers must eventually receive the message" bullet.

References: "InformaCam is a mobile application for Android that enables users to
inflate image and video with extra points of data, or metadata. The
metadata includes information like the user’s current GPS coordinates,
altitude, compass bearing, light meter readings, the signatures of
neighboring devices, cell towers, and wifi networks; and serves to
shed light on the exact circumstances and contexts under which the
digital image was taken. With InformaCam the app starts to behave
almost like Adobe Photoshop or GIMP, supporting non-destructive,
layer-based edits to media built on top of Obscuracam."
There is a sub-project to standardize metadata called j3m.

References: I don't fully understand the model that excludes GPS data as a
provider of a "specific place". Would the GPS satellites and ground
units be an "external" data source? If so, is your assertion that GPS
data from a device's logging app could be forged in transit?

Jitsi does OTR too, though it's a little weird to set up. A small team
I work with is using SparkleShare, which you can set up to use an SSH
tunnel as a connection proxy and even make sshd listen over a hidden
service, so that's pretty cool though a bit of an esoteric process for
your unaware teammates. I still use PGP email (actually more over the
last 4 months) and Thunderbird and Enigmail still work on all

Woah woah woah. When did the message go out about changing Tor to a "low
latency" network? High latency is the number one criticism of Tor from
In addition UDP traffic won't even pass through Tor. This results
in low-latency real time applications like VoIP impossible over that network
Perhaps the author is not aware of these properties of Internet protocols?

Sounds like we need new terms for a high latency network that is a low
latency network or a low latency network that is a high latency network?
Perhaps store-and-forward versus stateful?
