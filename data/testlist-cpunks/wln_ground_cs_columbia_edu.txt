@_subject: DC Meeting this weekend? 
Hello, all...
If there is going to be a DC meeting this weekend, please try to
determine by this evening what it will be...  I won't have mail access
after about 9am tomorrow until the end of the weekend, and I will be
in DC (Although, since I'm traveling with others, I don't know whether
I'll be able to make it even if I do know, but if I have some sort of
contact information, that can be worked out in other ways.)
Please excuse the pushiness, just trying to get a hectic couple of
weeks organized...
