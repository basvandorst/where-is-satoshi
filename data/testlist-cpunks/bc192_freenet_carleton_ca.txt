I've been trying to figure out the method of encryption for OSR2 Win95 and
Win98 *.pwl files and I was hoping someone had some details about the
method used. I've been told that resources are encrypted using RC4 with
a MD5 hash of the password as the key, although I haven't had any luck
using this information to decrypt resources with a known password. Does anyone have it figured out?

Peter Gutmann figured out the old system. In reaction the system was
changed by the OSR2 patch and in all further releases of Windows. What
exactly it was changed to is the question.
