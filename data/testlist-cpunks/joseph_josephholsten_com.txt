@_subject: who are the service operators here? 
I'm currently working on both chef cookbooks and dockerfiles for a bunch of old services I used to run in the good old days (pre 2000) of cypherpunks. Boring stuff like qmail, tinydns, pgp keyserver. But I'm dying to know what fancy new services people are operating these days. Any distributed chat ops? Blob/file storage? Remailers? Bitcoin pools?
In another vein, what ops do you think a self-sufficient punk ought to be running? I'm thinking I absolutely need:
- Tor endpoint
- vpn endpoint (openvpn?)
- smtp/imap sever (what's modern?{
- file/blob server (tahoe-lafs, camlistore?)
- jabber server (ejabberd?)
(Yes, my homepage is showing a ruby script. No, I don't have time to fix it in situ. Thus setting up my own servers)

It is the user/client's responsibility. Otherwise, you are susceptible to tracking pixels. Which I include in most of my emails these days.
I say as I send from my work machine, with a client that is entirely vulnerable to the things I argue are terrible.

@_subject: NSA UTAH data center 
References: Due diligence for datacenters is hard. Power and network claims are easy to make on paper. It's easy to just pay for equinix or supernap, but how do you prove you can actually handle their reqs when competitive bidding doesn't involve setting up a proof of concept install and load test? Much less prove QoS or response time or other things that you can't possibly compare on paper. Though I imagine the fort's ability to vet SLAs in contracts and enforce those clauses is way beyond most legal entities.

To sidetrack entirely, what would you consider a reasonable system?

Yes. They already have.

Seems like their standard is from Barak & Halevi, “A model and architecture for pseudo-random generation with applications to /dev/random.”
– Resilience: an adversary must not be able to predict future PRNG outputs even if he can influence the entropy source used to initialize or refresh the internal state of the PRNG;
– Forward security ( resp. backward security): an adversary must not be able to predict past (resp. future) outputs even if he can compromise the internal state of the PRNG.
Seems like a lovely defense-in-depth goal, but I'd really like to read the original paper to figure out why I should care.

References: You've shot down the approaches of Snowden and Assange before. I feel like I mostly understand your argument, but I'm not sure I know what you would have them do differently.
Is there anything in particular you think they should have done differently to accomplish their goals? Or do you think their goals were misguided? If so, what should their goal been, and what should they have done to accomplish it?
I know this seems I'm just trying to encourage counter factual arguments against history. But there will be more leaks, and more folks who are in a position to distribute them. What should they do?

Want. Anyone got the SIP fu to tell me where I should start trying to build this? I assume asterisk is still the platform of choice?
