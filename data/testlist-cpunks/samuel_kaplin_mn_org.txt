@_subject: Fwd: Anonymous Long Distance Phone Calling 
I wonder how anonymous this will be once the subpoenas start flying. I
think that this is still traceable via this method:
1) The authorities have you under physical surveillance (A tail)
2) Since they know where you've been they pull the phone records and see
   all of the outgoing calls.
3) They get the records from this company and match the time or the number
   that the call was placed from. (800 billing records have this)
4) Now they know where you called.
You are relying on this unknown company to NOT cave in when subpoenas are
flying around. I wouldn't, especially at 30+ cents a minute.

Unfortunately Herr Bizdos is not dealing with the business community, he is
dealing with the INTERNET community. While all the sabre rattling may be
acceptable within the business community, it is not acceptable within the
INTERNET community. In effect Bizdos created his own problem. If the code
was stolen, he should have had better physical security on it. If a
licensee anonymously posted it, he should have included a means of tracing
the code back to the source of the leak, then pursue that individual, not
the whole INTERNET crypto community. If the code was reverse engineered,
that's one of the risks in not patenting it. Personally I'm tiring of the
whole affair.

Today I received four whole messages from the cypherpunks list. Is it my
system or are things mighty quiet lately. Maybe the roundup of us chronic
dissidents has begun.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

@_subject: SUFFERANCE remailers 
:Definition of SUFFERANCE REMAILER: A remailer that exists only so
:long as the U.S. Feds get around to outlawing it.; a sitting duck
:remailer. ; a remailer whose physical location may easily be found.;
:a remailer whose operator is vulnerable to the State's gun argument.;
:currently, the only kind of remailer there is.
:   Definition of FORTRESS REMAILER: A remailer whose physical location
:cannot be found. ; a remailer that does not require the consent of
:the State. ; a Freedom remailer.
How about locating it in a recalcitrant country e.g. North Korea, Libya,
Iraq, Iran.  During the Gulf war scuttlebutt has it that Iraq used encrypted
communications on the Internet to keep its C3 functions up. (Command,
Control, Communications) If they can't get at the remailer its pretty hard
to shut it down. Use satellite communications instead of copper and it would
be real hard to shut down.
