bell at pacifier.com The original Apple II floppy disk drive held 143KB, though you could use
extra tracks if you were ambitious. The drive was a marvel, and was
considerably ahead of its competition. I remember the Commodore 64
drives (1541?) that were just plain slothful.
You could also use the other side of the disk, of course!
