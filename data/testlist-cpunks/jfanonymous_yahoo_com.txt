That sounds like censorship to me.
     Way to restrictive, kinda like COPPA aka Children Loose their Right to Free Speech Online (CLRFSO), a voilation of the first ammendment and of the Universal Declaration of Human      As seen in my signature:
"He who gives up liberty for security gets neither."
 - Ben Franklin
     In other words, I'm 100% against any federal law restricting internet users.
PS: I am a 7th grader, and DO NOT have/have need of a license to read books. I was able to get a library card at the age of about Ryan M. McConahy
