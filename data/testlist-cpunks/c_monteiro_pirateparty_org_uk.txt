@_subject: [ZS] Looking for Zero state input - Google glasses and the pirate 
Hi All
Below is an email I just fired off to pirate party international general
mailing list. It covers the emergence of google glasses and how having a
pro 'privacy' stance is increasingly a unintuitive term to use to describe
pirate party policies.
I was wondering how Zero State had or had not tackled describing the
freedom of of its citizens (what I've hastily referred to as 'peer to peer
privacy') against the privacy from traditional corporations/governments? Is
the framework for Zero State so robust that no one needs protecting from
it, or does this simply reflect the fact that there are so few structures
within Zero State that one might require protection from, that this
apparent contradiction has not yet been addressed?
Apologies if I'm mischaracterised the movement in this question - but if
you've an existing plan to tackle this dicotomy I'd love to hear it :)
