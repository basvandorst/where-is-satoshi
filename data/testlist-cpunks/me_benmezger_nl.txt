It could be possible, though I think they must have done in a different
way. I don't think waiting 27 days is an option, specially for the
source. Freenet has a file-sharing service by default, that could also
have been used. Mailing is an option too, though you have a risk of
loosing the package, so registering would be needed (fucking his
identify). I am really curious about this, since he was not yet caught.
Also what kind of encrypted chat did he have with the journalist? Did
they already have a OTR or something similar? Or did he have to "teach"
them like Snowden had?

"'Our firm, like many firms, provides worldwide regist
ered agent services for our professional clients (e.g., lawyers, banks,
and trusts) who are intermediaries. As a registered agent we merely help
incorporate companies, and before we agree to work with a client in any
way, we conduct a thorough due-diligence process, one that in every case
meets and quite often exceeds all relevant local rules, regulations and
standards to which we and others are bound.""

Will they at least shut down Panama's offshore?
Here is a full statement by Mossak in English:
Another question I keep asking myself: how did the source leak this
information? 2.7TB is quite a lot when transferring Online through a
secure channel (and that's is if he transfered online). I am assuming
through Tor it would take quite a lot of time, nevertheless he did a
quite good job, since he was not yet found...

Not related though, but somehow this reminded me when I bought my domain
at Transip.nl, where I set fake details (such as address and etc, though
real name), and after paying, a day later I received an email requesting
a copy of my passport + bank card to make sure I was really how I said I
was, otherwise they would be forced to block my account and further
address this "fake" issue. It reminded me of how ICANN can really mess
you up too, and personally.
