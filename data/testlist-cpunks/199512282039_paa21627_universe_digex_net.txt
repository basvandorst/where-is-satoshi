A freestanding implementation of MD5SUM (compiled from that in the PGP distribution) for DOS is at
ftp://ftp.csn.net/mpj/public/md5sum.zip and on the Colorado Catacombs BBS at 303-772-1062.
I suggested to Phil Zimmermann that he should put this in the next PGP release along with the compiled DOS version of PGP, but there hasn't been a new release of PGP since then.
Happy New Year!
