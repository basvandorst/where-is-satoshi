Logically this is (trivially) true, since PD imposes no conditions
while GPL imposes some. One possibility I can imagine is that those
who favour GPL and presumably also the ideas behind it could be
a bit more motivated to achieve a better quality of the software (including maintenance) than those who put software in the PD.
Of course this is just speculation and I have no way of knowing the M. K. Shen
