Hi
     My name is Jacqueline McCormack and I would like to show you how
easy it is to really make a lot of money. I wouldn't be wasting my time doing this if I didn't know this system works,and all the money you invest is less than an evening at the movies for two. Anyone surely can afford that.
 I received a letter just like the one your reading now from a lady name Karren Liddel and the rest is history. Here is the email I received and judge for yourself if this will work or not. This is truly the one path I've found to financial freedom.              Thanks for your time                     Jacque
        I Never Thought I'd Be the One Telling You This:
I Actually Read a Piece of E-Mail & I'm Going to Europe on the
My name is Karen Liddell; I'm a 35-year-old mom, wife, and
part-time accountant.  As a rule, I delete all unsolicited "junk"
e-mail and use my account primarily for business.  I received
what I assumed was this same e-mail countless times and deleted
it each time.
About two months ago I received it again and, because of the
catchy subject line,  I finally read it.  Afterwards, I thought ,
"OK, I give in, I'm going to try this.  I can certainly afford to
invest $20 and, on the other hand, there's nothing wrong with
creating a little excess cash."  I promptly mailed four $5 bills
and, after receiving the reports, paid a friend of mine a small
fee to send out some e-mail advertisements for me.  After reading
the reports, I also learned how easy it is to bulk e-mail for
free! I was not prepared for the results.  Everyday for the last six
weeks, my P.O. box has been overflowing with $5 bills; many days
the excess fills up an extra mail bin and I've had to upgrade to
the corporate-size box!  I am stunned by all the money that keeps
rolling in!
My husband and I have been saving for several years to make a
substantial down payment on a house.  Now, not only are we
purchasing a house with 40% down, we're going to Venice, Italy to
I promise you, if you follow the directions in this e-mail and be
prepared to eventually set aside about an hour each day to follow
up (and count your money!), you will make at least as much money
as we did.  You don't need to be a wiz at the computer, but I'll
bet you already are.   If you can open an envelope, remove the
money, and send an e-mail message, then you're on your way to the
bank.  Take the time to read this so you'll understand how easy
it is.  If I can do this, so can you!
                       GO FOR IT NOW!!
                       Karen Liddell
The following is a copy of the e-mail I read:
This is a LEGAL, MONEY-MAKING PHENOMENON.
PRINT this letter, read the directions, THEN READ IT AGAIN !!!
You are about to embark on the most profitable and unique program
you may ever see.  Many times over, it has demonstrated and
proven its ability to generate large amounts of cash.  This
program is showing fantastic appeal with a huge and ever-growing
on-line population desirous of additional income.
This is a legitimate, LEGAL, money-making opportunity.  It does
not require you to come in contact with people, do any hard work,
and best of all, you never have to leave the house, except to get
the mail and go to the bank!  This truly is that lucky break you've been waiting for!  Simply
follow the easy instructions in this letter, and your financial
dreams will come true! When followed correctly, this electronic,
multi-level marketing program works perfectly...100% EVERY TIME! Thousands of people have used this program to:
    -  Raise capital to start their own business
    -  Pay off debts
    -  Buy homes, cars, etc.,     -  Even retire! This is your chance, so don't pass it up!
Let's say you decide to start small just to see how well it
works. Assume your goal is to get 10 people to participate on
your first level. (Placing a lot of FREE ads on the Internet will
EASILY get a larger response.) Also assume that everyone else in
YOUR ORGANIZATION gets ONLY 10 downline members.  Follow this
example to achieve the STAGGERING results below.
1st level--your 10 members with
2nd level--10 members from those 10 ($5 x
3rd level--10 members from those 100 ($5 x 1,000)..........$5,000
4th level--10 members from those 1,000 ($5 x 10,000)...$50,000
                                                   THIS TOTALS       ----------->$55,550
Remember friends, this assumes that the people who participate
only recruit 10 people each.  Think for a moment what would
happen if they got 20 people to participate!  Most people get
100's of participants! THINK ABOUT IT!
Your cost to participate in this is practically nothing (surely
you can afford $20). You obviously already have an Internet
connection and e-mail is FREE!!! REPORT shows you the most
productive methods for bulk e-mailing and purchasing e-mail
lists.  Some list & bulk e-mail vendors even work on trade!
        About 50,000 new people get online every month!
*******TIPS FOR SUCCESS*******
 *  TREAT THIS AS YOUR BUSINESS!  Be prompt, professional, and
follow      the directions accurately.
 *  Send for the four reports IMMEDIATELY so you will have them
when     the orders start coming in because:
    When you receive a $5 order, you MUST send out the requested
    product/report to comply with the U.S. Postal & Lottery Laws, Title
    18,Sections 1302 and 1341 or Title 18,  Section 3005 in the U.S. Code,
    also Code of Federal Regs. vol. 16, Sections 255 and 436, which state     that "a product or service must be exchanged for money received."
 *  ALWAYS PROVIDE SAME-DAY SERVICE ON THE ORDERS YOU RECEIVE.
 *  Be patient and persistent with this program. If you follow
the     instructions exactly, the results WILL undoubtedly be
 *  ABOVE ALL, HAVE FAITH IN YOURSELF AND KNOW YOU WILL SUCCEED!
              *******YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINE*******
Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:
If you don't receive 10 to 20 orders for REPORT  within two
weeks, continue advertising until you do.  Then, a couple of
weeks later you should receive at least 100 orders for REPORT  If you don't, continue advertising until you do.  Once you have
received 100 or more orders for REPORT  YOU CAN RELAX, because
the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue
to roll in!
THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER:
Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in
front of a DIFFERENT report.  You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS
by watching which report people are ordering from you.  If you
want to generate more income, send another batch of e-mails and
start the whole process again!  There is no limit to the income
you will generate from this business!
NOTE:  If you need help with starting a business, registering a business name,                 how income tax is handled, etc., contact your local office of the Small
Business Administration (a Federal agency) for free help and answers to questions.
Also, the Internal Revenue Service offers free help via telephone and free seminars
about business taxes.

     This program does work, but you must follow it EXACTLY! Especially the rule of not trying to place your name in a
different position, it won't work and you'll lose a lot of
potential income.  I'm living proof that it works.  It really is
a great opportunity to make relatively easy money, with little
cost to you.  If you do choose to participate, follow the program
exactly, and you'll be on your way to financial security.           Sean McLaughlin, Jackson, MS
     My name is Frank. My wife, Doris, and I live in Bel-Air, MD.
I am a cost accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make
pretty good money. When I received the program I grumbled to
Doris about receiving "junk mail." I made fun of the whole thing,
spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I "knew" it wouldn't work. Doris totally ignored my supposed
intelligence and jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun
of her, and was ready to lay the old "I told you so" on her when
the thing didn't work... well, the laugh was on me!  Within two
weeks she had received over 50 responses. Within 45 days she had
received over $147,200 in $5 bills! I was shocked!  I was sure
that I had it all figured and that it wouldn't work.  I AM a
believer now. I have joined Doris in her "hobby."   I did have
seven more years until retirement, but I think of the "rat race"
and it's not for me. We owe it all to MLM.

    I just want to pass along my best wishes and encouragement to
you.  Any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come
in. I even checked with the U.S. Post Office to verify that the
plan was legal. It definitely is! IT WORKS!!!
           Paul Johnson, Raleigh, NC
    The main reason for this letter is to convince you that this
system is honest, lawful, extremely profitable, and is a way to
get a large amount of money in a short time. I was approached
several times before I checked this out. I joined just to see
what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money
required.  To my astonishment, I received $36,470.00 in the first
14 weeks, with money still coming in.
           Sincerely yours, Phillip A. Brown, Esq.
    Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make
up my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I
am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that
there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at
least get my money back. Boy, was I surprised when I found my
medium-size post office box crammed with orders!  For awhile, it
got so overloaded that I had to start picking up my mail at the
window. I'll make more money this year than any 10 years of my
life before. The nice thing about this deal is that it doesn't
matter where in the U.S. the people live. There simply isn't a
better investment with a faster return.

    I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I
wondered if I shouldn't have given it a try. Of course, I had no
idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I
was e-mailed another program...11 months passed then it came...I
didn't delete this one!...I made more than $41,000 on the first

     This is my third time to participate in this plan. We have
quit our jobs, and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off
the interest on our money.  The only way on earth that this plan
will work for you is if you do it. For your sake, and for your
family's sake don't pass up this golden opportunity.  Good luck
and happy spending!
