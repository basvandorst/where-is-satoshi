All it takes is just one person to really learn that a

That was even harder.
I will be there next October, and will be credentialed

Mr. Jeff get real.
You company is now on the record for GAK.
It hadn't until then. But now you are.
Now all the lower levels can decry what Mr. Clark said,

And....if you're not, Mr. Jeff, this being the electronic

So would a lot of others.

It isn't only clearing latency that's a problem. FV has already
taken over 5 days to deal with a simple account problem.
Latency might be a Good Thing(tm) in remailers, but it's a
Bad Thing(tm) in financial services. It's a "repuation market"
kinda thing. First Virtual is starting to fall down on many counts.
I'd have paid more if I could have found a place that would have
cleared things faster.
And....inasmuch as these are "real-time" computers we're dealing
with here on the net, bad transacions and fraud can be stopped cold.
Or with only minor losses, at the very most.

As long as ya wanna deal with 'who' rather than what,
anything I post is irrelevant.
And the reality of realtime cash conversion isn't pretty.
And it makes no difference if it's Netcash, FV, CheckExpress
or whomever it is. FV just happened to be there. It's kind of
an illustrated example, for if I was really bitching, I'd cancel
my account with them, tack it on my .sig, and post it all over usenet.
For if you could sell shirts easily, you would. you aren't.
Latency problems in cash conversion is still why.

Here's your chance to protest ITAR and whatever other CPUNK thing you feel worthwile.
CONGRESSIONAL MAILBOT SERVICE
This service is provided to make it easy for you to get your message to
all members of the House or Senate that have E-Mail mailboxes.  By sending
a single message to the service addressed at HOUSE at MAILBOT.COM and/or
SENATE at MAILBOT.COM, your single message will be expanded and resent to all
members of those specified houses as if YOU had E-Mailed each and everyone
of them yourself.
Any E-Mail responses to your inquiries will be sent directly back to your
own E-Mail box.
WHERE DO I SEND MY E-MAIL TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN?
In order to use this service, you need to address your E-Mail to one or
both of the addresses listed below.
FOR MEMBERS OF TU          House at Mailbot.com
FOR MEMBERS OF THE US SENATE:
         Senate at Mailbot.com
WHO WILL RECEIVE THIS E-MAIL?
Your incoming message is sent to all currently known members of congress
that have E-Mail mailboxes.  The Congressional Mailbot System updates it's
list of members of both the Houses every 30 days.  At that time, new email
addresses are added to the Mailbot Server.
WHAT TO INCLUDE IN YOUR MESSAGE?
Most members of congress do not have the staff to deal with replies via
both regular mail and E-Mail.  Most would prefer to reply to your specific
request by way of regular postal mail.  In order for them to do that, you
need to include your NAME, ADDRESS, CITY & STATE so that they can send you
a response.
WHAT NOT TO INCLUDE IN YOUR MESSAGE?
Basically, your message should be short and to the point.  It is not wise
to include large amounts of text from other sources.  If you want to point
out to them about such sources, simply tell them where you saw it.
Imagine getting hundreds of email messages containing the same material
over and over.  The meaning gets lost.  Make your message clear and easy
to read.
Each member of the House or Senate which receives a message from you via
the Mailbot, will respond with a reply message.
           THIS CAN GENERATE A LOT OF EMAIL INTO YOUR MAILBOX.
If for example, at the time you send your request to the Mailbot, there
are 130 members of the specific house you select, you will get back 130
reply messages from those members when they receive your message.
Currently, the automatic replies are about 750 bytes in size and only
contain a header with no message body.
These replies are sent to let you know that the Congress Person you sent
the message to, has received it in their E-Mailbox.
Some users use systems that only allow so much email per month for free
and then charge for email sent/received after that!
IF YOU CANNOT HAVE THIS AMOUNT OF TRAFFIC IN YOUR MAILBOX
PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE!
WHAT IF I WANT TO SEND A MESSAGE TO A SPECIFIC Congress Persons?
THEN YOU SHOULD NOT USE THIS SERVICE!  This service is for E-Mail intended
for ALL members of the House and/or Senate.  Individual messages to
specific Congress Persons should be sent by other means.
This is a very popular tool....  Several rules need to be enforced to
ensure that this service does not overburden the systems that are
connected to it.  The following rules are in place...
    1 The Mailbot will reject any message that is larger than 5,000 bytes
in size.  This provides you with a total of 66 lines of 80 columns per
line for your message which is a whole page of information to make your
    2 Please limit usage of the mailbot to no more than one message per 72
hour period (one each to HOUSE and SENATE is ok).
    3 Abusive and obscene messages violate the purpose and spirit of this
service and WILL place the originator of such messages on a rejection
Users who cannot abide by the above limitations will be placed permanently
on a rejection list and all further attempts to use the service will
result that user's messages being rejected by the service.
PROBLEMS OR QUESTIONS?
If you have any problems or questions about this service, please direct
them to the following E-Mail address:  Mailbot at Mailbot.Com
TELL A FRIEND?
If you should tell a friend or colleague about this service, PLEASE
INCLUDE THIS MESSAGE.  This will save them time in knowing what is
permitted and will keep questions about the service down to a minimum.
This Service is Provided By:
                       MAILBOT SERVICES OF ARIZONA
                       (c) 1995 Mailbot Services of Arizona.

As fast as it takes to FTP it over there.
I have copies of every server Netscape's got,
although I haven't unpacked them or used them.
Will this take up another 75 megs on the HD?

PGP signed message, through a chained MIXMASTER remailer to
help Phil Z.," and they all came back, and we was talking about
packet-sniffing, reputation markets, key cracking, ITAR, IP spoofing, Diffee-Hellman session keys, RC4, MD5, and all
those wonderful things right there on the group W bench...

Is the cracking of Netscape SSL the equivalant of lockpicking,
as opposed to the keycracking stuff we did (making a key).
And further, we can do it rather fast, like in minutes?
I just want to make sure I explain it to Jill Sixpack correctly. OK!

@_subject: C'Punks meet the T*'s, T*'s meet the C'Punks! 
Washington, DC is not a cyberpunk town.    TheXGrrrl  (Jessica Xavier) You are absolutely right. It's not a cyberpunk town.
It's a cypherpunk town, and I ultimately deal in munitions.
PGP, the program that signed this message, is a munition.
It's illegal to export the stuff. So good, the military uses it.
I will teach everyone how to use it, and make what's called:
A WEB OF TRUST!
Having a ninety person web of trust, will get you farther
than millions and millions of dollars. This is affectionately
known as "a reputation market". I started a small transgendered
reputation market last winter. It has yet to be broken. A TRANSGENDER WEB OF TRUST, can and will do more than HRCF ever
dreamed of. And in no time at all! Once you make and start to sign other persons keys, THEN YOU CAN RELY on what is coming to
your computer, and THEY CAN RELY on what is coming from you.
This is what the Human Rights Campaign Fund has relied on:
They have relied on us being in a web of omission!
They have relied on us worrying about being in error!
The result is that we are out of The Employment Nondiscimination Act.
THE CYPHERPUNK WEB OF TRUST is absolutely kewl!
We went from cracking a key, to cracking a bigger key, to
CRACKING NETSCAPE inside of one month. How we deal with ENDA
will be NO DIFFERENT, once a WEB OF TRUST IS IN PLACE!
Each signed PGP message extends the WEB OF TRUST. Each new key
means that SEXUAL IDENTITY is as important as SEXUAL ORIENTATION.
It effectively stops the so-in-so told so-in-so told so-in-so
stuff dead cold. And as a result I can now issue two HEADLINES:
CAROL ANNE BEGINS TO EXPAND "TRANSGENDER WEB OF TRUST".
CYPHERPUNKS WATCH CAROL ANNE FLEX PGP'S MUSCLE FOR TRANSGENDER'S.
For when we are in DC, I will help you all make and sign keys.
And when we're done, somebody will go to Phil Z. to sign his/her
key. You can then resign each key, and send it to the keyservers
in total confidence. Then you too, become a munitions dealer.
You will be amazed at who your new friends will become. What they will give you. THIS VERY COMPUTER THAT I TYPE ON, IS A
LIVING PROOF THAT THIS WORKS. Go do a whois on bugtown.com,
this will show you where my new box came from. I started the
CYPHERPUNK list with an 8088 at 2400 baud. I'm now at 486/66
at 14.4. And soon they'll have a secure server for me to use.
We have Joe & Jill Sixpack, on the cypherpunk list.
Joe and Jill are typical end users of computers.
I am the embodiment of Jill Sixpack.
The Cypherpunks know I can't write a word of code.
But I can, and do, market the stuff really well.
Cypherpunks, meet the Transgenders. Transgenders, meet the Cyperpunks. What you are about to witness is the implementation
of legislation in Washington, using PGP as the information
dissemination vehicle. Something unknown to exist at present.
No Miss XGRRL, we don't need too much money. We now need only
use the weapons at our disposal. They have been bought and paid
for by the blood and sweat of the Cyperpunk Community. They are
as good as having a nuclear missile pointed at THE HUMAN RIGHTS
CAMPAIGN FUND. They are ours for the taking, using and learning.
Just as being transgendered is a learning process, being a
cypherpunk is also a learning process. Washington will be cracked!
And having Pretty Good Privacy (tm) will be a whole lot better
than lots of money and tons of gossip. Transgenders need facts,
because our bodies are at stake. Cypherpunks need facts, because
privacy is at stake. Many privacy rights are at stake in ENDA!
I must end my rant now. Thanks for reading it.
Love Always,
Carol Anne Cypherpunk

@_subject: HEY!!! WAS: The Next Hack 
Hey wait a minute!!!
You HAD stated a patch would be available by Friday.
Now we are at early next week.
I watched the stock rise in the face of bad facts.
Almost 25% of your stock changed hands yesterday.
For the moment, it seems to me, anyway, you're getting
a lot of work done here for dirt cheap. I don't know
cypher codes very well, but I know Wall St. codes really
well. And THEY ARE BEING VIOLATED! I am glad there is no
anonymity on Wall St. We are starting to get into the
realm of SEC action. And I could really care much about
what happens out on the list.
This is not a problem that lends itself to 'quick fixes'.
For the only "quick fix you can give is still insecure crypto".
That is the point of this.
You can't really fix it.
Most of us know it.
The lies mount up
on the stock price.
I normally couldn't care less, I'm a Coca-Cola trader.
My stock is at an all time high as I write this.
It's up over 1200% in 10 years. No one can match it. (even MSFT)
This is much worse than NEW COKE!
For you are now better off letting them break key after key,
server after server, until the laws change. I'd go back and talk to your management fast.
For now you've become a pawn in a political game.
And millions of dollars change hands daily as a result.
Soon they will halt your stock trading if this keeps up.
Something, in a way far worse than ever having Netscape cracked!
Think about it.
Love Always,
Carol Anne

ps On the asides kind of things, do you realize the Netscape stock    base of 5,000,000  shares is not a big sharebase? Coca-Cola's is
   1,300,000,000. And by standards, your stock is really unstable.
   If Coca-Cola moves 3 points there'll be a trading halt, for the
   buying/selling imbalance will be too much. Even if only for 1 min.
   The trading halt gets the good or bad news onto "The Street".

@_subject: Ruritania 
The Legend of Ruritania
There was once a far away land called Ruritania, and in this land there was
a strange phenomenon  --  all the trees that grew there were transparent. In the old days, the people had lived in mud huts.   But now, high-tech wood
technology had been developed,  and in this new age of wood, everyone in
Ruritania found that their homes were all 100% see through. Now, until this point, no one ever thought of allowing the police to spy on
someone's home. But the new technology made this tempting. This being a
civilized country, however, warrants were required to use binoculars and
watch someone in their home. The police, taking advantage of this, would
get  warrants  to  use  binoculars  and peer in to see what was going on. Occasionally, they would use binoculars without a warrant, but everyone
pretended that this didn't happen. One day, a smart man invented paint -- and the people found that if they
painted their houses, suddenly the police couldn't watch all their actions
at will. Things would go back to the way they were in the old age -- completely private.
Indignant, the state decided to try to require that all homes have video
cameras installed into every nook and cranny.   "After all", they said,
"with this new 'paint' development, crime could run rampant. Installing
video cameras doesn't mean that the police get any new capability -- they are just keeping the old one."
A wise man pointed out that citizens were not obligated to make the
lives of the police easy, that the police had survived all through the mud
hut  age  without  being  able  to  watch  the  citizens at will,  and that Ruritania  was  a  civilized  country  where  not  everything  that  was expedient was permitted. For instance, in a neighboring country, it had
been discovered that torture was an extremely effective way to solve
crimes.   Ruritania had banned this practice long ago, in spite of its expedience.   Indeed, "why have warrants at all", he asked, "if we are interested only in expedience?" A famous paint technologist, Dorothy Quisling, intervened however.  She noted that people might take photographs of children masturbating should
this new paint technology be widely deployed without safeguards, and the law was passed.
Soon it was discovered that some citizens were covering their mouths while speaking to each other, thus preventing the police from reading their lips through the video cameras. This had to be prevented, the police
 said. After all, it was preventing them from conducting their lawful
 surveillance. The wise man pointed out that the police had never before been allowed to listen in on people's homes, but Dorothy Quisling pointed out that people might  use  this  new  invention  of  covering  their mouths with veils to discuss the kidnapping and mutilation of children. Now, no one in the legislature  wanted  to be accused  of being in favor of mutilating children, but then again, no one wanted to interfere in people's
rights to wear what they liked, so a compromise was reached whereby all
homes had to have microphones installed in each room to accompany the video cameras. The wise man lamented few if any child mutilations had ever been solved by the old lip reading technology, but it was too late --
the new law was passed  and microphones were installed everywhere.
However, soon it was discovered that this was insufficient to prevent
citizens from hiding information from the authorities, because some of
them  would  cleverly  speak  in  languages  that  the police  could  not understand. So, another new law was proposed to force all citizens to
speak at all times only in Ruritanian, and, for good measure, to require that they speak clearly and distinctly near the microphones. "After all",
Dorothy Quisling pointed out, "they might be using the opportunity to speak in private to mask terrorist activities!" Terrorism struck terror
into everyone's hearts, and they rejoiced at the brilliance of this new
law. Meanwhile, the wise man talked one evening to his friends on how all of
this was making a sham of the  constitution of  Ruritania, of which all
Ruritanians were proud. "Why", he asked, "are we obligated to sacrifice all our freedom and privacy to make the lives of the police easier? There isn't any real evidence that this makes any big dent in crime,
 anyway! All it does is make our privacy forfeit to the state!" However, the wise man made the mistake of saying this, as the new law
required, in Ruritanian, clearly and distinctly, and near a microphone. Soon, the newly formed Ruritanian Secret Police arrived and took him off,
and got him to confess to crimes by torturing him. Torture was, after all,
far more efficient than the old methods, and had been recently instituted
to stop the recent wave of people thinking obscene thoughts about tomatoes,
which Dorothy Quisling noted was one of the major problems of the new age
of plenty and joy.

No, I'm not good at this sort of thing (we all know that)

It's better than a clock for everyone gets messages differently.
But you can change the s/n ratio and durations of s/n to generate

Kurnit is Back and Mining the Internet
  "Like Arnold, he'll be back. I've been listening to what
he has to say for a long time. If you listen to him, you'll
hear how the Web is the way and that the proprietary services
are a dead model. If you listen between-the-lines, you'll hear
a modified version of that vision. A best of both worlds
vision. You'll hear that he wants to develop easy to use,
functional services on the Web. Like easy to use chat.
Like easy to use bulletin boards.
Like AOL, but on the Web."
-Thoughts on Scott Kurnit in a piece regarding the failed MCI/News Corp
joint venture from Seidman's Online Insider for the Week Ending February
9, 1996.
Kurnit's back, and almost exactly a year to the day since the clip above
was written.  On Monday February 10, the new company Kurnit founded, The
Mining Company, will announce their plans to basically build AOL on the
Web.  I'm not sure about the choice of February 10 as the day to announce
this.  It is a day with special significance for me.
On February 10, 1972 I had a dilemma.  I was hungry for breakfast and
wanted some cereal.  I had cereal, but no milk.  So I called my mom at
work and asked her if I could run across the street to the convenience
store.  My mom said no because "the street" was more like a highway and
because I was 9 years old.
"You'll get hit by a car," my mom said.  As you might imagine, I went
anyway.  And as you also might have guessed by now my mother was right,
except no car was good enough for me.  I had to face off with a
ten-wheeler (it was an Amoco <  > Oil tanker.)
Twenty-two stitches in the head, a healed broken wrist and 25 years later,
I'm still hanging in there.  I don't remember anything about it, including
seeing the truck.  I've always wondered if I was pushed.  What I do
remember was waking up in the ambulance with quite a headache.  But since
then, seeing how I lived and all, I've always viewed February 10 as a GOOD
The Mining Company may not be a truck setting its sights on running down
AOL or even other Web content aggregators (even to some degree NetGuide
Live), but it is an interesting model.
*What It Is*
In effect, The Mining Company wants to be the biggest online service on
the Web, ultimately offering 4,000 special-interest areas in an
integrated, easy-to-use interface.  Whether you call these special areas
channels, departments or categories -- it's all the same thing.  Kurnit
wants to capitalize on the fact that it takes too long to find what you
want on the Net.  He wants to put it all in one place with one consistent
interface so that you can easily find what you're looking for and interact
with those who have common interests.
Each "channel" will have content, bulletin boards, online chats, links to
other good stuff on the Web in the particular area of interest.  You'll
also be able to search a site via Verity's search engine or search the
entire Net via Digital's Alta Vista.
While they are currently testing another chat product, they have decided
to move to the iChat chat client.
In the test system I had access to, the bulletin board system was very
easy to use, but painfully slow.  I'll cut them some slack since they are
still in beta, but users will need to be able to move around the boards
quicker than what I experienced or they will likely be put off.
*And Now for Something Really Different*
When Kurnit first ran the vision by me a couple of weeks ago, I said "To
me it seems like this is..."
"AOL on the Web," Kurnit interrupted.
"Not exactly," I said, "It's like AOL on the Web with a hint of Amway
thrown in."
One of the problems with providing editorial context for the Net is that
it winds up costing a lot of money.  Kurnit's previous venture with
MCI/Newscorp was iGuide.  They built a great guide to the Net, but
ultimately they scaled it back to just become a guide to entertainment on
the Net.  You've read the reports all over the place about scaled back
editorial efforts and rightsizing.  Good editorial doesn't come cheap, at
least not when done traditionally.
The Mining Company isn't going after the traditional model of hiring a
bunch of full-time editors and bringing them in house.  They plan to use
folks already out there on the Net.
Once upon a time while I was at IBM, I helped recruit Chris Locke, of
MecklerWeb notoriety away from the MCI/News Corp effort Kurnit was
While there are many things Chris and I do not agree on, I was very much
in synch with Chris when it came to the idea of communities of interest on
the Web.  Give remote people the tools to produce the content, Locke would
say, and you'd be able to easily build hundreds if not thousands of
communities of interest very inexpensively.  Locke who is now with a
hardware company in Colorado will no doubt take interest in what Kurnit
and the gang at The Mining Company are up to, because they are all about
providing the tools to produce the communities of interest inexpensively!
If your chosen as one of its forum moderators (they call them Guides),
you'll be given access to all the tools you need to build a site on the
Now you may be thinking, "Ah, GeoCities does that already!"  GeoCities
<  > gives free web pages and is organized around
certain communities of interest.  But their homesteader program is not
about setting up an all-encompassing online service.  And while it is a
great place to create a free web page, there's no real business model for
the person creating the page.  If you build a great site there, GeoCities
gets the revenue on all the traffic that goes there.  Because it has a lot
of traffic, GeoCities can send some traffic to your Web site.  But in the
end, the model for GeoCities is one to give you a free page on the Web.
This is good for you if you're just in it for the fun of it, and good for
GeoCities too.   I think GeoCities is great, but if I am looking for
something in particular, I wouldn't think to look there first.  The Mining
Company wants to create a space that no matter what it is you hope to
find, you'll look there first.
*They Call them Guides*
The Mining Company wants to create quality communities of interest.  And
for every community (channel) created, there will be a unique
moderator/editor.  The Mining Company calls them Guides.  It's looking for
more than just a few quality folks to become Guides and form their
service.  Starting Monday, they will begin accepting applications to
become Guides on the  service. There could be multiple sites about the
same thing during the start-up phase, but  ultimately it will be whittled
down to one Guide/site per special interest.
To ensure quality, they'll be a review committee set-up to make sure
quality standards are up to snuff, including some folks from the community
of Guides.  Kurnit believes between that, the natural inclination for
other Guides to point out areas of, um, weakness and user feedback,
they'll have a good handle on quality.
Additionally, there will be some in-house editorial to oversee major
groupings (like Technology, Personal Finance, etc.)
"The Mining Company is dedicated to serving the needs of its Guides and
users," said Kurnit.  "We give the tools and support to the Guides to help
users find what they want, trust what they find, and connect them with the
most valuable sites on the Net and with other interesting people."
"This model is now only possible because of the team effort at The Mining
Company to integrate the latest improvements in Internet technology and
the newly identified needs of users and independent Web producers," adds
*Getting the Guides*
Will it be easy to get the ultimately thousands of Guides necessary to run
this service?
"How much talent is out there," asks Kurnit.   "We look at the thousands
of pages out there on AOL, GeoCities, etc., and the rest of the Internet,"
Kurnit said.  "All we think we need to get is 2%-3% of the talent pool."
In certain areas it will likely be very competitive.  Everyone will want
to get there first.
"First there's the application process," said Scott Kurnit in a phone
Interview.  "You're going to show us your bio and you're going to write
some columns so we can see your writing style.  If you make the grade, you
make it to our orientation process," Kurnit said.
The Mining Company places its focus on training the Guides and giving them
the tools they need to make a site.   If you "make the grade" you
basically have 3 weeks (2 of which are the "orientation") to get a site
up-and-running on the service.
"The fact is, if you can't get it done in a reasonable time then you
probably don't have the dedication or time to get it done," says Kurnit.
Just how much time will it take for Guides to put together sites?  "We're
not looking for anyone to quite their day jobs," said Kurnit.  "We're
looking at about a 10 hour a week commitment to produce the sites."  But
Kurnit also says  that though there will be only one Guide per site, the
Guides will be able to line up assistants.
*What's in it for You?*
So why The Mining Company then?   Why not GeoCities or doing it on your
own?  Well, there are a couple of reasons.  One is the promise of
exposure, the other is the promise of MONEY.
There is a model here, especially if you're not looking to quit your day
job.  While I imagine it will have to shift its model somewhat, there are
some opportunities to make a buck or two for the Guides.  It might not be
much money, but if you're already throwing 10 hours or so a week towards
maintaining a Web page that lines up around a special interest or two, any
money is better than what you're probably getting now.
Basically, The Mining Company is looking to allocate 40% of all
advertising revenues back to the Guides themselves.  The real pool here is
30%, with the additional 10% being used for things like bonuses.  So, how
does it work?
Kurnit is looking to get quickly to a million or so page views a day (each
of the pages I saw had 2 advertisements.  By the end of the year, Kurnit
hopes to be in the 10 million - 15 million page views.  It sounds a little
ambitious, but if they're successful lining up quality Guides, it could
become a reality.  So let's say they're getting 5 million page views per
day.  Based on what I saw, that would net out to be about 300 million ads
running per month.
Lets say ad sales average out to $30/1000 (a $30 CPM).  Based on that,
you're looking at a cool $9 million a month in advertising revenue.  So
$3.6 million is in the Guide pool, but only $2.7 million is for the true
revenue split.  Now, let's say you're a Guide who got one-tenth of 1
percent of The Mining Company's overall traffic. You'd make a cool $2,700
a month for your efforts.  If you happen to be a guide in one of the
"killer categories" whether it be a parents site or a kids site or a
computing site, it's not unreasonable to think that you might get as much
as 1%.  That would be $27,000 per month!!
Some people will balk at the 40%-60% share, but I think that's pretty
fair.  Where I'd predict the model will have to change, however, is in the
cases where the cost per thousand (CPM) view being charged the advertisers
is much higher than the average of the overall site.  If the overall site
average is $30/1000, but your site is generating a CPM of around $90,
you're probably not going to want to be paid based on averages.
*Will it Work?*
In short, I think this could work quite nicely.  The premise of a front
door that links to content that is all packaged with a consistent look and
feel is a winning premise.   With AOL's recent move to flat-fee, one big
advantage a Net service has over a proprietary model like AOL is the
ability to create content far more easily and inexpensively. Much coverage
has been given this week regarding AOL beginning to charge its partners in
its Company Connection a $55,000 fee each year to participate.
Some in AOL are saying its reasonable since the areas amount to "free"
advertising for the companies, but realistically speaking, I think it is a
maintenance fee AOL is charging to offset the cost of dealing with these
forums.  I think it is reasonable to expect to see AOL begin to charge
similar fees for any content that isn't "must have" for them, now that the
hourly charges that once subsidized these areas are gone.  There is a cost
of throwing in-house support at these online areas and much of the cost is
due to the fact that it's a proprietary system.  Setting up new "forms"
and new looks just isn't easily accomplished by the content providers
themselves.  So, the timing may be good for The Mining Company.
There are at least two tricks Kurnit and Co. must pull off.  First, they
have to get the Guides.  That starts on Monday, when they begin accepting
applications.  The next will be to market the site in a way that gets
people to the front door.   Internet of the people, for the people and by
the people, it has a nice ring to it...  I'm sure we'll hear more about
this when the site officially launches in April.
For more info, check out <  >, sometime on Monday,
they will make a lot more information available there than the "coming
soon" that was there as of this writing.

wants to capitalize on the fact that it takes too long to find what you
want on the Net.  He wants to put it all in one place with one consistent
interface so that you can easily find what you're looking for and interact
with those who have common interests.
Each "channel" will have content, bulletin boards, online chats, links to
other good stuff on the Web in the particular area of interest.  You'll
also be able to search a site via Verity's search engine or search the
entire Net via Digital's Alta Vista.
While they are currently testing another chat product, they have decided
to move to the iChat chat client.
In the test system I had access to, the bulletin board system was very
easy to use, but painfully slow.  I'll cut them some slack since they are
still in beta, but users will need to be able to move around the boards
quicker than what I experienced or they will likely be put off.
*And Now for Something Really Different*
When Kurnit first ran the vision by me a couple of weeks ago, I said "To
me it seems like this is..."
"AOL on the Web," Kurnit interrupted.
"Not exactly," I said, "It's like AOL on the Web with a hint of Amway
thrown in."
One of the problems with providing editorial context for the Net is that
it winds up costing a lot of money.  Kurnit's previous venture with
MCI/Newscorp was iGuide.  They built a great guide to the Net, but
ultimately they scaled it back to just become a guide to entertainment on
the Net.  You've read the reports all over the place about scaled back
editorial efforts and rightsizing.  Good editorial doesn't come cheap, at
least not when done traditionally.
The Mining Company isn't going after the traditional model of hiring a
bunch of full-time editors and bringing them in house.  They plan to use
folks already out there on the Net.
Once upon a time while I was at IBM, I helped recruit Chris Locke, of
MecklerWeb notoriety away from the MCI/News Corp effort Kurnit was
While there are many things Chris and I do not agree on, I was very much
in synch with Chris when it came to the idea of communities of interest on
the Web.  Give remote people the tools to produce the content, Locke would
say, and you'd be able to easily build hundreds if not thousands of
communities of interest very inexpensively.  Locke who is now with a
hardware company in Colorado will no doubt take interest in what Kurnit
and the gang at The Mining Company are up to, because they are all about
providing the tools to produce the communities of interest inexpensively!
If your chosen as one of its forum moderators (they call them Guides),
you'll be given access to all the tools you need to build a site on the
Now you may be thinking, "Ah, GeoCities does that already!"  GeoCities
<  > gives free web pages and is organized around
certain communities of interest.  But their homesteader program is not
about setting up an all-encompassing online service.  And while it is a
great place to create a free web page, there's no real business model for
the person creating the page.  If you build a great site there, GeoCities
gets the revenue on all the traffic that goes there.  Because it has a lot
of traffic, GeoCities can send some traffic to your Web site.  But in the
end, the model for GeoCities is one to give you a free page on the Web.
This is good for you if you're just in it for the fun of it, and good for
GeoCities too.   I think GeoCities is great, but if I am looking for
something in particular, I wouldn't think to look there first.  The Mining
Company wants to create a space that no matter what it is you hope to
find, you'll look there first.
*They Call them Guides*
The Mining Company wants to create quality communities of interest.  And
for every community (channel) created, there will be a unique
moderator/editor.  The Mining Company calls them Guides.  It's looking for
more than just a few quality folks to become Guides and form their
service.  Starting Monday, they will begin accepting applications to
become Guides on the  service. There could be multiple sites about the
same thing during the start-up phase, but  ultimately it will be whittled
down to one Guide/site per special interest.
To ensure quality, they'll be a review committee set-up to make sure
quality standards are up to snuff, including some folks from the community
of Guides.  Kurnit believes between that, the natural inclination for
other Guides to point out areas of, um, weakness and user feedback,
they'll have a good handle on quality.
Additionally, there will be some in-house editorial to oversee major
groupings (like Technology, Personal Finance, etc.)
"The Mining Company is dedicated to serving the needs of its Guides and
users," said Kurnit.  "We give the tools and support to the Guides to help
users find what they want, trust what they find, and connect them with the
most valuable sites on the Net and with other interesting people."
"This model is now only possible because of the team effort at The Mining
Company to integrate the latest improvements in Internet technology and
the newly identified needs of users and independent Web producers," adds
*Getting the Guides*
Will it be easy to get the ultimately thousands of Guides necessary to run
this service?
"How much talent is out there," asks Kurnit.   "We look at the thousands
of pages out there on AOL, GeoCities, etc., and the rest of the Internet,"
Kurnit said.  "All we think we need to get is 2%-3% of the talent pool."
In certain areas it will likely be very competitive.  Everyone will want
to get there first.
"First there's the application process," said Scott Kurnit in a phone
Interview.  "You're going to show us your bio and you're going to write
some columns so we can see your writing style.  If you make the grade, you
make it to our orientation process," Kurnit said.
The Mining Company places its focus on training the Guides and giving them
the tools they need to make a site.   If you "make the grade" you
basically have 3 weeks (2 of which are the "orientation") to get a site
up-and-running on the service.
"The fact is, if you can't get it done in a reasonable time then you
probably don't have the dedication or time to get it done," says Kurnit.
Just how much time will it take for Guides to put together sites?  "We're
not looking for anyone to quite their day jobs," said Kurnit.  "We're
looking at about a 10 hour a week commitment to produce the sites."  But
Kurnit also says  that though there will be only one Guide per site, the
Guides will be able to line up assistants.
*What's in it for You?*
So why The Mining Company then?   Why not GeoCities or doing it on your
own?  Well, there are a couple of reasons.  One is the promise of
exposure, the other is the promise of MONEY.
There is a model here, especially if you're not looking to quit your day
job.  While I imagine it will have to shift its model somewhat, there are
some opportunities to make a buck or two for the Guides.  It might not be
much money, but if you're already throwing 10 hours or so a week towards
maintaining a Web page that lines up around a special interest or two, any
money is better than what you're probably getting now.
Basically, The Mining Company is looking to allocate 40% of all
advertising revenues back to the Guides themselves.  The real pool here is
30%, with the additional 10% being used for things like bonuses.  So, how
does it work?
Kurnit is looking to get quickly to a million or so page views a day (each
of the pages I saw had 2 advertisements.  By the end of the year, Kurnit
hopes to be in the 10 million - 15 million page views.  It sounds a little
ambitious, but if they're successful lining up quality Guides, it could
become a reality.  So let's say they're getting 5 million page views per
day.  Based on what I saw, that would net out to be about 300 million ads
running per month.
Lets say ad sales average out to $30/1000 (a $30 CPM).  Based on that,
you're looking at a cool $9 million a month in advertising revenue.  So
$3.6 million is in the Guide pool, but only $2.7 million is for the true
revenue split.  Now, let's say you're a Guide who got one-tenth of 1
percent of The Mining Company's overall traffic. You'd make a cool $2,700
a month for your efforts.  If you happen to be a guide in one of the
"killer categories" whether it be a parents site or a kids site or a
computing site, it's not unreasonable to think that you might get as much
as 1%.  That would be $27,000 per month!!
Some people will balk at the 40%-60% share, but I think that's pretty
fair.  Where I'd predict the model will have to change, however, is in the
cases where the cost per thousand (CPM) view being charged the advertisers
is much higher than the average of the overall site.  If the overall site
average is $30/1000, but your site is generating a CPM of around $90,
you're probably not going to want to be paid based on averages.
*Will it Work?*
In short, I think this could work quite nicely.  The premise of a front
door that links to content that is all packaged with a consistent look and
feel is a winning premise.   With AOL's recent move to flat-fee, one big
advantage a Net service has over a proprietary model like AOL is the
ability to create content far more easily and inexpensively. Much coverage
has been given this week regarding AOL beginning to charge its partners in
its Company Connection a $55,000 fee each year to participate.
Some in AOL are saying its reasonable since the areas amount to "free"
advertising for the companies, but realistically speaking, I think it is a
maintenance fee AOL is charging to offset the cost of dealing with these
forums.  I think it is reasonable to expect to see AOL begin to charge
similar fees for any content that isn't "must have" for them, now that the
hourly charges that once subsidized these areas are gone.  There is a cost
of throwing in-house support at these online areas and much of the cost is
due to the fact that it's a proprietary system.  Setting up new "forms"
and new looks just isn't easily accomplished by the content providers
themselves.  So, the timing may be good for The Mining Company.
There are at least two tricks Kurnit and Co. must pull off.  First, they
have to get the Guides.  That starts on Monday, when they begin accepting
applications.  The next will be to market the site in a way that gets
people to the front door.   Internet of the people, for the people and by
the people, it has a nice ring to it...  I'm sure we'll hear more about
this when the site officially launches in April.
For more info, check out <  >, sometime on Monday,
they will make a lot more information available there than the "coming
soon" that was there as of this writing.

Kurnit is Back and Mining the Internet
  "Like Arnold, he'll be back. I've been listening to what
he has to say for a long time. If you listen to him, you'll
hear how the Web is the way and that the proprietary services
are a dead model. If you listen between-the-lines, you'll hear
a modified version of that vision. A best of both worlds
vision. You'll hear that he wants to develop easy to use,
functional services on the Web. Like easy to use chat.
Like easy to use bulletin boards.
Like AOL, but on the Web."
-Thoughts on Scott Kurnit in a piece regarding the failed MCI/News Corp
joint venture from Seidman's Online Insider for the Week Ending February
9, 1996.
Kurnit's back, and almost exactly a year to the day since the clip above
was written.  On Monday February 10, the new company Kurnit founded, The
Mining Company, will announce their plans to basically build AOL on the
Web.  I'm not sure about the choice of February 10 as the day to announce
this.  It is a day with special significance for me.
On February 10, 1972 I had a dilemma.  I was hungry for breakfast and
wanted some cereal.  I had cereal, but no milk.  So I called my mom at
work and asked her if I could run across the street to the convenience
store.  My mom said no because "the street" was more like a highway and
because I was 9 years old.
"You'll get hit by a car," my mom said.  As you might imagine, I went
anyway.  And as you also might have guessed by now my mother was right,
except no car was good enough for me.  I had to face off with a
ten-wheeler (it was an Amoco <  > Oil tanker.)
Twenty-two stitches in the head, a healed broken wrist and 25 years later,
I'm still hanging in there.  I don't remember anything about it, including
seeing the truck.  I've always wondered if I was pushed.  What I do
remember was waking up in the ambulance with quite a headache.  But since
then, seeing how I lived and all, I've always viewed February 10 as a GOOD
The Mining Company may not be a truck setting its sights on running down
AOL or even other Web content aggregators (even to some degree NetGuide
Live), but it is an interesting model.
*What It Is*
In effect, The Mining Company wants to be the biggest online service on
the Web, ultimately offering 4,000 special-interest areas in an
integrated, easy-to-use interface.  Whether you call these special areas
channels, departments or categories -- it's all the same thing.  Kurnit
wants to capitalize on the fact that it takes too long to find what you
want on the Net.  He wants to put it all in one place with one consistent
interface so that you can easily find what you're looking for and interact
with those who have common interests.
Each "channel" will have content, bulletin boards, online chats, links to
other good stuff on the Web in the particular area of interest.  You'll
also be able to search a site via Verity's search engine or search the
entire Net via Digital's Alta Vista.
While they are currently testing another chat product, they have decided
to move to the iChat chat client.
