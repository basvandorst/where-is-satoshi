@_subject: Remailing 
Would it be possible to incorporate a ping into the remailer?  Say give it
a list of known remailers for the chain and have it pick one at random,
then ping it. If the remailer responds then send out the mail, otherwise
pick a new remailer, and repeat....
Or this there a flaw in this that I'm just too ignorant to see?
