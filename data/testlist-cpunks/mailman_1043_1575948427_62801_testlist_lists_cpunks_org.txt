   [1]MinimeMongo writes that the "Associated Press reports that China's
   police ministry on Sunday [2]handed out rewards of up to $240 to
   people who reported pornographic Web sites in a campaign to stamp out
   online smut...The online crackdown is part of a sweeping official
   morality campaign launched this year on orders from communist
   leaders."
