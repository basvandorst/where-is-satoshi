100 km.  This may of course change depending on technological development.  It has been suggested to me that one could have secure stations where interception and reception of the message would be allowed. [10]  This is possible, but weakens the �absoluteness� that is the appeal of quantum cryptography.  that Eve will not interfere on the public channel.  It could be very possible that Eve would set herself up between Alice and Bob on the quantum and private channels, and act as a relay station that I mentioned in the first point.  She would have to impersonate both Alice and Bob, who in reality might not even be on the same public and quantum channels, but merely think they are.  Public key methods could be used for authentication, but this destroys the motivation for the use of quantum �public�.  Meaning a random and public switching of public channels, phone numbers and such.  Even this may be subverted by a very powerful Eve who may also control the phone company�s switching circuits.  Perhaps further thought can resolve this issue, but the problem of identification and authentication on the public channel is severe.
attack.  If Eve wishes, she may destroy the unique and expensive quantum channel, or merely observe everything that goes by, not caring to read the information, just making it unsuitable for use by Alice and Bob.  Ekert�s concept of keeping shared EPR pairs in permanent storage (perhaps using a superconductor to warehouse keys when the quantum channel is open) is not yet feasible, and it will be necessary to keep these keys somewhere , but the security of keys is not a problem unique to quantum cryptography.  further  development of the technology that will allow quantum cryptography to become a �practical� security mechanism.

(the quantum channel) though I've never heard of it described in quite this way.  When I refer to the Public Channel, I am referring to the channel that Alice and Bob talk on so that they may compare the blocks or bits that they have both received.  Hence, a powerful enough Eve could insert herself in the private channel (this is very much discussed) as well as the public channel (which I haven't seen addressed.)
private channel and impersonating Alice (to Bob), and Bob (to Alice), but this results in a non-correlation of the measurements when compared over the public channel.
be possible to dupe Alice and Bob.  I expect what is important is the definition of what a public channel is?  (Still haven't got access to my original thoughts on this, will say more later.)
