I read this: "The unique identifying numbers of over half a million smartphones have been recorded by a network of recycling bins in central London. Hundreds of thousands of pedestrians walking past 12 locations unknowingly had the unique MAC address of their smartphones recorded by Renew London."
Maybe also it should be added to this list, some thought about MAC and DHCP randomness? Is this feature included in any of tools recommended?

what I try to say is, appears two men attack each other for 50 messages.
every message is short and only attack. maybe you are fake or not but
point is: this sucks for everyone else, the list becomes pure garbage pile.
two ideas:
1, make longer and more detail arguments. consider reader.
2, avoid personal attack. if not for respect to other man then respect
other reader that have made offended you (yet)
if who is anarchist and who is not is important to you, ok, but i ask
you please "take it outside."
if any mods here, agree?
sorry for my english.
