Why not wait for him to leave the house and then pick him off?  If
necessary, jam one of his video cameras or shoot it with a silenced
rifle from afar.  When he ventures forth to determine what's wrong with
it, shoot him in the head.
Once he's dead, frustrating the alarm company is even easier.  Then you
have all the time you want to disarm mines, ransack the compound, hold
an Iraqi/Libyan hooker party, and prank call the White House and the NSA
(just before closing time; no sense in being around when the feds show
up, though perhaps they'd give everyone a reward for eliminating TCM).
