I've seen the URL for the Stormfront White Nationalist Resource
Page listed at least three different ways.  I've never tried to
visit the site, but here are the three variations with the most
recent one I've seen listed last.

@_subject: Anti-Electronic Racketeering Act of 1995 (fwd) 
The use of terms such as "virus" and "hacker" in a context such
as this has little or nothing to do with what the terms actually
mean.  It's palpably obvious that they are being bandied about
here solely for the knee-jerk emotional reactions they evoke.
Even those more computer/net clue-impaired than Grassley (assuming
that such is possible) know from watching TV and the movies that
a virus is a Bad Thing (tm) and that hackers are evil!
Pseudo-digital demagoguery.
Or simply kidnap him and escort him back to the U.S.
It might be even more beneficial if Senator Grassley and the other
members of our august deliberative bodies would meet the internet.
My gut reaction to the recent tide of legislation is that they are
seeking to stangle what they fear and that they fear what they do
not understand.  (Too melodramatic?)
You don't recognize them because they are masquerading as "virus hackers".
Again, the main reason for playing the "terrorist" card is
for the emotional hot-buttons they can push by so doing.
Since Grassley didn't use it, look for someone to introduce
something this session titled, "The Avenge Those Poor,
Innocent, Bloody Dead Children Act of 1995".

@_subject: misfeasance in office (was: Re: Root Causes) 
While I recognize this to be the case, it remains exceedingly
frustrating.  It would seem that a textbook example of
misfeasance (not malfeasance) would be the act of introducing
and/or participating in the passage of legislation that a
member knew or should have known was unconstitutional -- at
least when misfeasance is defined as "the performance of a duty
or right which one has the right to do, but in a manner such as
to infringe upon the rights of others."  [anno. 20 ALR 104]

@_subject: Suing/Reputations (was: Root Causes) 
I composed my "misfeasance in office" post before reading this
thoughtful  and well researched message from Damaged Justice.
I had read all of the messages in my mailbox with "Re: Root
Causes" as the subject, but missed this one, since the subject
line had been changed.
Damaged Justice has looked into this in much greater depth than
I have, and raises some interesting possibilities.  (Obviously, IANAL.)

I'm posting this again, not because I think it contains any
particularly profound insights, but rather because I initially
sent it around midnight last night and it was not reflected
here so I suppose it did not make it out.

@_subject: NOISE: advice on applications 
I've just recently set up a PPP account, mainly so I could run Netscape.  I'm thinking of adding PC Eudora for mail.
Any advice on a good newsreader and any other applications
it would be handy to have?
