@_subject: Risk with the Mac OS X 10.4.10 version number (Yip, RISKS-24.72) 
I have several counter-risks here:
* writing applications that ignore the known (perhaps sometimes non-trivial)
  best practice, which is to detect the capabilities required by the
  application (and which, as I discover, has been supported by the Gestalt()
  API since Classic OS 6.0.4)
* if not using the best practice, writing applications that depend on a
  third point of the OS version;
* if detecting a minor OS version, writing applications that refuse to run
  instead of displaying a warning dialogue.
Having said which, the definition of MAC_OS_X_VERSION_ACTUAL does seem
incredibly short-sighted.
