What about an analog filter placed before the digitizer? Nowadays there
should be inexpensive single-chip implementations of multiple-tap equalizers
made for consumer audio. You just have to straighten up the amplitude
ignoring the phase rotation, because the power spectrum is a real-codomain
function (being the Fourier Transform of the autocorrelation, which is an
even function). It won't be perfect, but it'll help.

Hmmm... IMHO, it just means that you can't rely on statistic tests
alone in order to measure entropy content. In fact, you can't measure it at
all: you can only set upper bounds, but, sadly, no lower bounds.
Remember: also pi's digits would pass DIEHARD, and an external attacker
could well inject such kind of EMI into an unshielded receiver.

Well, linear analog filters are reversible, so, by themselves, they neither
destroy nor create information. In practice they may add some noise of their
own, drowning the original signal, but in our case this is good, not bad :-)
The relationship between entropy and reversibility is a deep one, of course.
That's also why reversible computing can, among other things, reduce the
power consumption without any theoretical limit.

Uhm, strange: I thought that the main attraction of a Dutch company was the
lack of withholding tax on royalty payments made to non-residents, that,
combined with the tax treaties between The Netherlands and most countries
(which allow tax-free payment from those countries to the Dutch company),
makes it an ideal vehicle to receive royalties on a (almost) tax-free basis.
But if the patents were held by Digicash Inc., what was the point of having
Digicash BV?

Anyway, "methinks" is in Shakespeare ("The lady doth protest too much,
methinks." - Hamlet, Act III, Scene 2), so perhaps "mewrote" might vaunt an
illustrious pedigree...
