@_subject: totally secure email? 
Howdy!  I'm trying to totally secure email as soon as it comes into a site,
before it hits me mailbox.  I don't have root access, though. :(
What I've tried is to do a "|pgp -feat ecarp|rmail erc%khijol at apple.com",
but pgp just produces empty files!  If I execute it by hand, it works.
Anyone know either (1) why it isn't working wnd how to fix it, or (2)
suggect a better alternative?  For political reasons, my email must be encrypted
as soon as it hits the site before it gets dropped in my mailbox, or the sysadmin
will read it (snoopy bugger) and find out I'm looking for a job elsewhere.
Thanks for all your help!!
