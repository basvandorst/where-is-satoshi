If a non-expert may interject.. while I can't judge how realistic it would be to repeal laws or to do some of the other things mentioned in this thread, it seems to me that "making parole cost less" would be defeated by the simple economics of spending x to house someone, and not spending x not to. Like I say, I'm not intimate with the details of costs of prisons or of monitoring parolees - is there more to it than that? It seems like it would be too artificial to simply add costs where there aren't any.
