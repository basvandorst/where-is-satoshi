do the math.
  s
where: d = stamp delay in seconds
        s = spam size in bytes
        b = bandwidth in bytes per second
assuming unlimited bandwidth, if a stamp spammer compromises roughly the same number of PCs as were compromised during the last worm attack (350,000) at 15 seconds per stamp, you end up with 1.4 million stamps per minute or 2 billion stamps per day.  When you compare that to the amount of spam generated per day (high hundred billion to low trillion), they are still a few machine short of what is necessary to totally render stamps useless.  Yes, maybe one spammer could muster a few machines to be a nuisance but that's the extent of it.
When dealing with hardware acceleration, it becomes a hardware war.  If they can make a custom hardware, Taiwan can make us USB stamp generators, postage goes to a period of rapid inflation, and the world goes back to where was before with no advantage to spammer's.
again, work the numbers to figure out the basic model and where the threat roughly lives.  Personally, I think that any system that tweaks the e-mail protocols basically loses for reasons of adoption and backwards compatibility.  I've put a lot of effort into the camram implementation to create significant backwards compatibility without leaving someone vulnerable to spam.
also, zombied machines are a threat but the beauty of any proof of work system is that the machine will start overheating if it's used too much and the CPU load will become noticeable to the user.  So in a way, stand generating zombies might actually do the net some good and takeout these machines.  or cause another blackout in New York State...

References: well, stamp speed is method of rate limiting.  This equation/formula gives you the ratio of performance degradation.  So,
Given d=15, b=49152 (aka 384kbps) and s=1000
the slowdown ratio or factor is 737.28 times over what an unimpeded spammer can send.  But as you increase spam size, the slowdown factor actually, it would take 15 but only because you can be sending one stamped piece of spam at the same time as you're generating the next stamp.  But using your spam size, , the slowdown factor becomes roughly 73 times.  So they would need 73 machines running full tilt all the time to regain their old throughput.  It's entirely possible that one evolutionary response to stamps would be to generate larger pieces of spam but that would also slow them down so we still win, kind of, sort of...
actually, I'm hearing that there are roughly one billion addresses but unfortunately have lost the source.  The numbers for spam I'm hearing are on the order of 76 billion to 2 trillion
2 tril spams /day 76 bil                 If you have a better source (and I am sure there are some), I would like to hear it.
unfortunately, I think you making some assumptions that are not fully warranted.  I will try to do some research and figure out the number of machines compromised.  The best No. I had seen to date was about 350,000.
well, that might be the case but I must have a who cares attitude about that.  For the most part I rarely send mail to strangers and the stamp generation process is in background.  So if it take several minutes to queue up and send a piece of mail a few times a month.  What's the problem? (yes, I know I'm being cavalier)
wrong unit of costs.  The stamps still take 15 seconds (give or take) which means approximately 5760 stamps per day.  Hardware acceleration is an attack against stamps by using dedicated hardware to shrink the cost in time of a given size stamp.  so, if and evil someone can build an ASIC to shrink the cost of a stamped by 100 times, then mercenary somebody else can build the same functionality and performance as well.   Plop it onto a USB interface chip, sell for $15 and balance is restored

take a look at my headers and you'll see a real example.

References: R. A. Hettinga propagated:
actually, no it doesn't.  The real, working code has a configuration file which contains a list of all known addresses associated with the account.  That list of addresses is necessary because of people having virtual domain based addresses collecting all at 1 mailbox.
The code uses that list of valid addresses in the stamp validation process.
mailing lists are your "friend".  While I don't have the code in there yet, I expect I will need to pay attention to the -request form of addresses and white list both the -request form and the plain form for a while.  Ideally, the mailing lists would sign each message with its own private key and use the white list by public key filtering method client side.
while I know this is the cypherpunks list, but if you ever get tired of debating this to death and would like to write some real code, let me know.  ;-)

actually, we mean burned literally.  the stamp creation process raises the temperature of the CPU.  Most systems are not build for full tilt computational load.  They do not have the ventilation necessary for reliable operation.  So, they may get by with the first 8-12 hours of stamp generation (i.e. roughly 2000-3000 stamps per machine) but the machine reliability after that time will degrade as the heat builds up.   Feel free to run this experiment yourself.  Take a cheat machine from your local chop shop, run hashcash in an infinite loop, and wait for the smoke detector to go off.
there is nothing quite like waking up to the smell of freshly roasted Intel.
that is a nasty bit of news.  I'll run some numbers based on that and see what the ratio of spam to stamp engines would be.  gut sense is that it's still not horrible, just not as advantageous.  but you never know until you run the numbers.
thanks for the information and the source.

*ouch*.  on 24x7 both power and connectivity?
and nobody has noticed.  That's mine bogglingly astounding.  A friend of mine just bought an XP machine and insisted on grabbing updates herself over her modem.  yes, she has soft firewalls and virus protection in place but I'm willing to bet she's one of the compromised now so I should probably investigate detection/removal tools.
you do need to give Microsoft credit, after all, they are the world leader in zombie friendly software.  I figured they probably have at least a three-year head start over Linux in this arena.
no, it was a stock Intel motherboard, CPU, CPU fan in a standard (i.e. not cheap) case with reasonably sized power supply (i.e. 300 watts).  It has the standard number of fans.
I think this makes it even more imperative to develop the kit ability of dynamically increasing postage process based on what your peers say.
what a way to start the new year.  ;-)  Alan, I do appreciate you carrying the message as it were.
