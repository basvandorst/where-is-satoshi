I would hope so.  Does the Neo claim to be compatible with the open
specification?  Exactly!  :)  Rootkits or compromised firmware...  And even if a
compromised device does cache my pin and use my card (while briefly
inserted), I hope to be alerted of any illicit accesses courtessy
of the signature counter built into the card.
There seem to be at least 3 potential "cards" that I'm aware of:
(I put "cards" in quotes, because the Crypto Stick includes a
"thumb" form-factor USB interface.  Though not as tiny as the
Neo, it still supports 4096 bit keys.)

I selected the OpenPGP SmartCard V2 for my personal use, because
the Crypto Stick has been out of stock for a while, and the Yubikey
Neo appears to only support 2048 bit keys.  If I really want the
"thumb" form factor of the Crypto Stick, I may try popping out the
ID-000 minicard from the OpenPGP SmartCard and putting it into a
"Gemalto USB Shell Token V2" (aka the "IDBridge K30").  Otherwise,
the "SCM SCR3500" reader is almost small enough for use on a key
chain, and is widely available at reasonable prices.  (about $40
total for a SmartCard V2 with a SCM SCR3500 reader.)
