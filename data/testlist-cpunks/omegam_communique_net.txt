This is a straw man anyway.  You don't know this now.  Someone you are
communicating with could already be forwarding plaintext to a third
party unbeknownst to the sender.  This is a "do you trust the recipient" issue.

No.  But there is in their's(PGP Inc.) as I think you and others have
amply demonstrated.  The technical issues alone are enough to reject
usage of PGP5.5's CMR features.
It intrigues me that there has been virtual silence from PGP employees
on the technical issues.  Only Hal Finney via the IETF-Open-PGP has come
anywhere near commenting upon this.  I haven't seen anyone from PGP
Inc. comment on your data-recovery implementation ideas.  In my optimistic moments, I take this as a sign that internally, PGP
inc. is giving consideration to producting more sensible and effective
solutions.  (Maybe even as outlined here)

See above.  The prescence of flags does not prevent this.  By
definition I might add ;).  Trust issues, etc. are involved.

Hal Finney's description of key sttributes indicate that implementing
separate storage keys would not be hard for PGP Inc to implement in
the next release.   > Decentralised control is good, of course, but the pgp5.5 and SMTP

systems.  That PGP, with it's reputation and stated policies, would is
surprising.  Hopefully, PGP will live up to their reputation by realizing this
misstep and correcting it with a more secure, less GAK-compliant
implementation.  > The PGP bashing PGP observes is an attempt by the pro-privacy crypto

The "bashing" in this notoriously harsh forum has been rather tender
in my view.
Perhaps the perception of "bashing" is based on recognition (and
guilt) that the CMR mechanism is flawed and goes against "the spirit
of PGP."  Methinks, y'all doth protest too much.
