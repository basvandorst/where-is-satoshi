@_subject: The NSA (Was Re: Factoring - State of the Art and Predictions ) 
As a former civilian TS Clearance holder working for the government, I can tell you I was amazed at what a small percentage of classified material really deserves to be classified.  90% of what I saw could be categorized as 1)trival, 2)in the public domain already, or 3)politically embarrassing.  For example, look at the long classified human radiation experiments just coming to light. The government certainly wasn't hidding that info from the Russians, they were hiding it from the voters. I remember once fighting for months to get access to some classified papers on the fracture characteristics of ceramics only to find them to contain nothing that hadn't been available in the public domain for 20 years. This of course has a lot to do with the strange sociology of government bureacracies where the combination of classified information with need-to-know restrictions create powerful petty-fiefdoms that lead to increased perks and prestige.  The other thing to realize is that inside the bureacracies there's little in the way of the vigorous competion of ideas (primarily because of the manipulation of need-to-know restrictions) that characterizes academia.  Bureaucracies tend to foster myopia and tunnel vision rather than risk taking and originality.  My guess (and it's only that) is that if all of NSA's secrets were laid bare, maybe 10% of what they have would be truely unique and the other 90% would be surprisingly pedestrian.
