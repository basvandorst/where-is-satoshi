@_subject: For your information 
After seeing some of your newsgroup postings, I may have something that will interest you.  If you're not interested, just delete this message.  This will be the only message you will receive.
$$$ GET ATTENTION FOR YOUR PRODUCT OR MESSAGE $$$
It's an application called Ready-Aim-Fire for Windows 95. It will connect to your news server, download the Email addresses of all the people posting messages to that group (or groups), and Email your message to all those addresses.  Ready-Aim-Fire will get your product or message out of the crowd and into your customers' hands.  Ready-Aim-Fire will deliver your message right to their door, so to speak.  If you post a message to a business oriented newsgroup it's stuck right in the middle of hundreds of others.  A prospective customer may look in once in a while, or only once, and you'll miss him.  With Ready-Aim-Fire you can focus on the persons in the group who are most interested in the subject.  That is, the people who post the messages.  The great part is the price!  It's only $39.95.
