government approach, you still retain some level of choice -- i.e. if you don't like Mankato's ability to track you through this card, don't go to Mankato, or perhaps more realistically, minimize usage of the card.  This seems kind of similar to the arguments about a company's right to use escrowed keys.  There is no reason why a company can't mandate that all use escrowed keys for employees conducting company business (email, transactions, etc.).  If the company is regularly using its keys to examine your mail and it pisses you off, quit and work for a different company that treats its employees with more respect.  In any case, choice is preserved.
