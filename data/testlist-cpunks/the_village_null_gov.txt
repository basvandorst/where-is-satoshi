This is supposed to have a legal basis?
Duncan, it's even easier. Here ya go:
1. Buy a copy of Windows 95.
2. Install it on a machine.
3. Install it on a second machine.
There, SPA: you can now go sue every ISP from which every reader of
this list obtains their mail.  They have just published information on how to pirate Windows '95.

@_subject: write to SPA re: suit against C2 et. al. 
If you haven't read it yet, read the press release
on their page at  and see how they'd
like to 1. impose prior restraint on speech, and 2. turn ISPs into little police organizations, doing SPA's will.
I think it's time for a little outrage.
