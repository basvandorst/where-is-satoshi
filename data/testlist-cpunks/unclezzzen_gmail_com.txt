@_subject: [liberationtech] What I've learned from Cryptocat 
will soon stop being a web-based service, and will
only exist as a browser extension.
The question is, what should future web-app developers do if they need
crypto? Rewrite all crypto primitives from scratch [and hope there's
enough interest in reviewing the code], then let users install yet
another extension?
I believe there's a better solution. I've posted something about it. I
hope some of you would  find it interesting.

@_subject: [liberationtech] Request for comments - a #CryptoParty-oriented 
I have an idea for a keysigning protocol that IMHO can better suit
 events than the "traditional" ones.
Please comment (preferably at the post) if you see faults it it,
possible attacks in it, etc.
This is not theoretical. We might have an event soon :)

The reason why FireGPG no longer ships with tails is that the DOM of a web
app is not a safe place for plaintext
Any architecture where plaintext is stored inside a web app's DOM is
dangerous. Especially a webmail app that can be expected to save drafts,
but not only. Web apps can be MITMed, XSSed, etc. If it came via the web,
it's a suspect.
I'd expect a crypto add-on to only accept plaintext (and other sensitive)
information via separate GUI that can only be launched manually (not via
javascript in an app's DOM) and has a hard-to-imitate look-and-feel (to
discourage phishing). The only communication between this add-on and the
rest of the browser should be via the clipboard. Users who can't handle
copy/paste shouldn't be trusted with a key pair :)
provide even more shooting-yourself-in-the-leg firepower than FireGPG.
