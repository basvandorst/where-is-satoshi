I have problem understanding time complexity for the

We place it on a single tape turing machine

the book says it takes  roughly 2n steps to match

therefore the whole computation takes O(n^2) time.
how is that,should n't be O(2n)
the same if placed on a two tape turing machine is as

tape2 : aaabbb

As far as i can extend the previous attack,i.e faking
1 packet for interlock protocol in the above 1 you
propose,extending the same attack it only takes
one and a half faked packets to launch a succefull
attack on the above proposal.
let let 1:1  indicate 1 st packet ,1st half
1:2  indicate 1 st packet , 2nd half
2:1  indicate 2 nd packet, 1st half
2:2  indicate 2nd packet , 2nd half and so on
so we are now have  1:2 and 2:1 as one complete
and so on
No:     A               M                B
1                    A->1:1           M->1:1   2    M->1:1          B->1:1           3                    A->1:2           M->1:2 4    M->1:2          B->1:2          5                    A->2:1           M->2:1
6    M->2:1          B->2:1
7                    A->2:2           ******
The blank spaces corresponding to each row indicates
that it is a sender and the other 2 are receivers.
Once Mallory receives A->2:2 ,he has 2 full packets in
hand and has faked 1 and a half packets(Step 7)
**** indicates that it is now the earler packet Bob
receives of Alice after Mallory's manupilation.
I hope that table will give some clarity.
now he can send Bob the original message of Alice.
So I think the above suggested protocol will not work.
Mallory can still get away with his scheme

then an extra parameter would govern it & we

so can we say atmospheric noise is random or a coin
flipping is random-only because it passes die hard

@_subject: Diffie-Hellman and MITM 
If there is no previous shared secret,then ur
communication on an insecure network is susecptable to
the man in the middle attack.
One solution suggested against the man in the middle
attack is using the interlock protocol
InterLock Protocol Is used to foil a man in the middle attack, 1:>Alice sends Bob her public key 2:>Bob sends Alice his public key 3:>Alice encrypts her message with Bob's public
key.She sends half of the encryped message to Bob. 4:>Bob encrypts his message using Alice's public
key.He sends half of the encrypted message to Alice. 5:>Alice sends the other half of encrypted message to
Bob. 6:>Bob puts the 2 halves of Alice's message together &
decrypts it with his private key.Bob sends the other half of the message to Alice. 7:>Alice puts the 2 halves of Bob's message together &
decrypt it with her private key. Here Mallory can still substitute his own public key
for Alice & Bob . Now when he interceprs half of Alice's message,he
cannot decrypt it with his private key & re-encrypt it with Bob's public key .He must invent a
completely new message & send half of it to Bob. When he intercepts half of Bob's message to Alice,he
has the same problem. He cannot decrypt with his private key & re encrypt
with Alice's public key. By the time the second half of the message of Alice &
Bob arrive,its already too late to change the new message he invented. The conversation between Alice & Bob need to be
completely different. How ever if Mallory can mimic Alice & Bob,they might
not realise that they are being duped & may get away with his scheme
here is what i think
It is not compulsary that all the blocks of messages
must be invented by Mallory.
he only need to make the first full message  for alice
and send it to bob & vice versa.
1:>alice send bob part of 1 st block
2:>bob makes the 1 st half on his own and send to bob
& keeps alice's message
3:>now bob sends his first half of message
4:>mallory intercept it and make his own message and
send it to alice
5:>Again bob sends alice the other half of the msg
which mallory intercepts & substitue his own 2nd part
of his block
6:>the same happens when bob sends the second half of
his message to alice,mallory intercepts it and sends
his own 2 nd block to alice.
since he has send one full block to each other & has
the full block of alice's and bob's true
messages,mallory can now split  it as half and
complete the protocol
since the 1 st packet is fake,he has the true packets
of alice & bob & can complete the protocol.
All mallory would have to do is send the half of the
(n th) packet when he receives the half of (n+1)th
packet since the 1 st packet was faked by mallory.
so i dont think the interlock protocol will work in
this case.
thats how i understand it.
am i not rite?

1:>Choose 2 large prime numbers p & q 2:>choose n=p*q & z=(p-1)*(q-1) 3:>choose a number relatively prime to z anc call it
d. two numbers (a,b) are said to be relatively prime if
gcd(a,b)=1 eg: (5,25) are not relatively prime coz 5 is gcd & not 1 how ever (5,27) are relatively prime coz gcd is 1 In particualr a prime number is relatively prime to
all the numbers except its multiples. 4:>find e such that e*d=1 mod z here ' = ' means equalance or congrurnce & not equal
to. a ( congruent) b modulo c,if c/(a-b) or in other words
if a/c gives remainder b 5:>to encrypt plain text p,cipher text c is calculated
as if ^ denote exponent c=p^e (mod n) 6:>to decrypt, p=c^d(mod n) We take an example, It is just for the understanding of the reader & uses
very small numbers. choose p=3 q=11 hence n=3*11=33 z=(3-1)*(11-1)=20 we find e,such that 7*e(congruent)1 (mod 20),yeilds e=3 I will try explain with the same example. 7*e=1 (mod 20) means,find e such that 20/( (7*e)-1) For this we use the euclidean algorithm & the euiler
fermat theorom The eucledian algorithm simply find the gcd of 2
numbers. here our purpose of using it is to find gcd of 2
numbers & see if they are relatively prime. Accoring to euiler-fermat theorom if gcd(a,m)=1, that
is they are relatively prime then the solution (unique mod m) of the linear
congruence ax (congruent) b (mod m) is given by x (congruent) b* ( a^(phi(m)-1)) (mod m) where phi(m)
is the euiler totient function or the euiler phi function. if(a,m)=d,then it will have d solutions modulo m. how ever we are only interested in (a,m)=1,hence 1
solution mod m. well,Just a few defenitions Defenition of Euiler Totient If n>=1 ,the euiler totient phi(n) is defined as the
number of positive integers not exceeding n that are relatively prime to n. here are just a few examples if n=1 phi(1)=1 if n=2 phi(2)=1 (only 1 is relatively prime to 2) if n=3 phi(3)=2 (1 & 2 are relatively prime to 3) if n=4 phi(4)=3 (1,2,3 are ...) if n=5 phi(5)=4 (1,2,3,4 are...) if n=6 phi(6)=2 (1,5 are...) here is a usefull property 1 might need to apply some
times phi(m*n)=phi(m)*phi(n) if gcd(m,n)=1 If a prime p does not divide a then a^(p-1) (congruent) 1 (mod p) now as in the example 7*e (congruent) 1 (mod 20) let us take e=x so, 7*x (congruent) 1 (mod 20) by eulier fermat theorom x(congruent) 1*(7^(phi(20)-1)) (mod 20) phi(20)=8.i.e there are 8 numbers less than 20 which
are relatively prime to 20 This process of computing the euiler totoient is
speeded up on a computer using the eucledian algorithm which finds gcd(a,b),for all a les than b &
count those a which are relatively prime to b whose sum gives the euiler totient. ok,so x (congruent) 1*(7^(8-1)) (mod 20) x (congruent) (7^7)mod 20 x (congruent) 823543(mod 20) 823543/20 gives remainder 3,that is 823543(mod 20)=3 therefore x=3 or e=3. this is how e is actually obtained in the above
example. the rest of the encryption & decryption are as
mentioned above,i haven't continued the example with that part since i guess u only need to
know how the key is generated. to encrypt we have 2 keys (e,n) to decrypt we have 2 keys (d,n) n=p*q is easy to calculate d is a number relatively prime to z choose a random d,test gcd(d,z) =1 using the euclidean
algorithm,continue the process till u find one. the only othe key is e,which as above explained is
found using the euiler-fermat theorom & the euclidean algorithm. In this manner e,n,d can be found for large primes as
well. Do You Yahoo!?

One more query on the same topic.
Two events E1 and E2 are said to be independent,if
As in the above case we assume that the bits under xor
are independent.
if the inputs are frm different sources then we
consider them independent.
what about the following case.
i open any two text files in binary mode and xor 1 st
bit of file 1 with file 2,2 nd bit with 2 nd bit with
second bit and so on.
The rate of english varies between 1.0 bit /letter &
1.5 bit/letter for large values of N.
absolute rate of english is R=log(26)base 2=4.7
There is lot of redundancy in the language,0.6 to 0.85
percent redundancy.
Since in ASCII we use 8 bits to represent english
alphabets,the redundancy is 8-1.3=6.7 bits/charecter
of redundancy.
Since in both files opened,english charecters are
represented in the same set of ASCII charecters.
there is redundancy in both the files.
Does that mean that such bits we xor are not

Bill Stewart"  wrote
okay-lets look the same in a communication protocol.
We have digital cash transactions between Bank A and
Bank B.
Say I am an employee of Bank A.
I don't keep the IV as secret,i just append the IV
along with the cipher text which i have chained using
a chaining mode and send it to bank B.There is a man
in the middle M,who also sniffs out the IV,now he can
successfully perform a block replay attack.
I can think of one way this can be prevented.
It would take us to share a common seed value (a
secret)between Bank A and Bank B.
1.Bank A uses a pseudo random number generator like
Tauss88 with a period of nearly 2^80 or MT19937 with a
period of 2^19937-1 and generates the first IV using
the generator.
2.This IV,is used for chaining but the IV itself is
not transmitted along with the cipher text to the bank
of B.
3.Once the chained cipher text reaches bank of B, they
use the common seed to generate the first IV and this
IV can be used to obtain the actual cipher text.
4.Continue steps 1 to 4 till the period of the
generator.If we use Taus88 we can get nearly 2^80 IV's
and if we use MT19937 we can get upto 2^19937-1 IV's.
We also dont need to hash the IV's itself though they
form a linear recurring sequence, since they are not
transmitted from Bank A to Bank B and we derive no
information of the IV from any number of blocks of the
chained cipher text.
In this way the attacker can no longer perform block
replay attacks.
The funny part is that I have seen some cryptographic
utilities simply appened the IV to the chained cipher
text and transmit to a receiver.

I was reading the following paper Complexity, Vol. 7, No. 5, May/June 2002, pp. 14-21
PARADOXES OF RANDOMNESS
Gregory Chaitin
Under the sub heading- Program-Size Complexity,it says
"Okay, so what does it mean then for a number to be
interesting or uninteresting, now that I'm giving you
a better idea of what I'm talking about. Well,
interesting means it stands out some way from the
herd, and uninteresting means it can't be
distinguished really, it's sort of an average, typical
number, one that isn't worth a second glance. So how
do you define that mathematically using this notion of
the size of computer programs? Well, it's very simple:
a number is uninteresting or algorithmically random or
irreducible or incompressible if there's no way to
name it that's more concise than just writing out the
number directly. That's the idea. In other words, if the most concise computer program
for calculating a number just says to print 123796402,
in that case, if that's the best you can do, then that
number is uninteresting. And that's typically what
happens. On the other hand, if there is a small,
concise computer program that calculates the number,
that's atypical, that means that it has some quality
or characteristic that enables you to pick it out and
to compress it into a smaller algorithmic description.
So that's unusual, that's an interesting number. "
How ever if i take the set of positive whole
numbers(zero included),i.e S={0,1,2,...} ,I can
compress every positive whole number using a computer
program which says
f(x)=2x for all x=0,1,2,... ;
f(x)=2x+1 for all x=0,1,2,...;
and  i simply put it an infinite loop shown in the
following pseudo code
int x=0;
generate f(x)=2x;
generate f(x)=2x+1;
In this way we can compress all the positive whole
numbers because
say i have a number 10. I try to find if it is
interesting or not.
decimal 10 = 1010 in binary
it takes 4 bits to store decimal number 10
I can write a computer program to generate decimal 10
=10    for x=5;
Decimal number 5 can be represented in binary as 101.
So we have 3 bits to represent 5.
Using these 3 bits of information,i can get the
decimal number 10,when i use f(x)=2x;
Similarly-any positive whole number can  be compressed
using the above pseudo code.
This is because
Any whole number multiplied by 2 will give an extra
I have f(x)=2x
I choose x=2, 10 in binary(2 bits).
2*2=4 , 100 in binary(3 bits).
There is an extra bit that gets added ,when we
multiply by 2. I am sure that this is very obvious
So this way I can compress any positive whole number
and thus I can show all the whole numbers are
interesting contradicting the claim in the paper that
most of the whole numbers are uninteresting numbers. He uses this concept of uninteresting numbers to
demonstrate algorithmic randomness.
The paper further says-
"Once you set up this theory properly, it turns out
that most numbers, the great majority of positive
integers, are uninteresting. You can prove that as a
theorem. It's not a hard theorem, it's a counting
argument. There can't be a lot of interesting numbers,
because there aren't enough concise programs. You
know, there are a lot of positive integers, and if you
look at programs with the same size in bits, there are
only about as many programs of the same size as there
are integers, and if the programs have to be smaller,
then there just aren't enough of them to name all of
those different positive integers."
But we already have developed a small concise,as in
the pseudo code shown above,that generates me any
number of whole numbers. This contradicts the above
Further down,under the sub heading Redundant,he says-
"Is this K bits of mathematical information? K
instances of the halting problem will give us K bits
of Turing's number. Are these K bits independent
pieces of information? Well, the answer is no, they
never are. Why not? Because you don't really need to
know K yes/no answers, it's not really K full bits of
information. There's a lot less information. It can be
compressed. Why? "
All logs are base 2.
"And this is going to be a number between zero and K,
a number that's between zero and K. 0 # # that halt # K
And if you write this number in binary it's really
only about log K bits. # that halt = log K bits
Now how can there be redundancy in various instances
of a halting problem.
Say-i have a sack with 64 programmes of which ,i know
that 32 of them will halt and 32 of them will not
halt.I pick,without any order, 32 programs from my
sack to check whether they halt or not.
If the input programmes are picked truely
randomly,then I know 16 of the programs will halt(i.e
50% of the programs halt).
So where is the redundancy in different instances of
the halting problem? I don't see any redundancy.
If the input programs are picked independently,i.e
without any mathametcial structure,the output is by no
means reduntant.
In the section-Redundant,he obtains a real number
called k,which he transforms to k bits of information.
Then he says that there is redundancy in the output
and says that there is only log k(base 2) bits of
information. Here he treats k as a real number and
says that-he only needs log k(base 2) bits to
represent the whole number k. But that is the minimum
number of bits that is required to hold the real
number in binary representation in its information
theorotical sense. What does it have to do with
algorithmic randomness?
it comes to such a question-
I do a fair coin throwing experiment with 64 coins.
To represent 64 coins,i need 5  bits of information.
If the experiment is truely random,i will get 32 of
them as heads and 32 of them as tails-though I dont
know which all are heads and which all are tails.
now-I see which all are heads.While counting,when I
get 32 heads,I can stop counting,since i know the
remaining 32 coins are tails.
To represent 32 coins-i need 5 bits of information.
Since the experiment is truely random-i know half of
them will be heads,so in this case using 5 bits of
information,i can determine all the coins that are
heads and that are tails.
So-the question is what is the minimum number of bits
or entropy required to determine which all coins are
heads and which all coins are tails,is it 5 bits or 6
bits of information?
What chaitin does in his k instance halting problem
-is he compresses the 6 bits to 5 bits,if we draw an
equivalent with our coin tossing experiment,which we
can,as it is equivalent to the coin tossing problem.
 It appears that it is on these lines he obtains the
omega notation,though the exact details are not given
in this paper.
This is what I think.I would like to know more.

Okay- I need 5 bits to represent 32 coins.I count as
coin 0,coin 1,... coin 31.
If it is a perfectly random fair coin throwing
experiment,then 50 percent of them will be heads.
So I know that 16 of them will be heads.
What we do is i simply place all the 32 coins on the
table in a row or column.
I look at the first coin and determine if it is a head
or a tail. I repeat the same proccess till i count 16
heads. If I count 15 heads at coin 31, then I cant
reduce the entropy. How ever, if i count 16 heads at
coin 30,then I dont have to check that coin 31,I
already know its a tail,so I have less than 5 bits of
So if it is a perfectly random experiment,I wouldn't
get 16 heads before i look at coin 31,which is the
last coin and thats what you said-isn't it?
So how did chaitin get to compress the information
from k instances of the turing machine in
 under the sub-section redundant?
he says-
"Is this K bits of mathematical information? K
instances of the halting problem will give us K bits
of Turing's number. Are these K bits independent
pieces of information? Well, the answer is no, they
never are. Why not? Because you don't really need to
know K yes/no answers, it's not really K full bits of
information. There's a lot less information. It can be
compressed. Why? "
If the input programs are truely random-there is no
redundancy and thats a contradiction to the claim in
the paper.

Thank you-one more question.
Will the information obtained from the 2^32 tests have
a zero compression rate? If one of the occurance should yield all heads and one
occurance yields all tails-there appears to be scope
for compression.
If the output is random,then it will have no

compress it at all.

India has 30 million middle class people.An income of
1000 US dollar per month is considered as middle
Thats one reason of strong foreign market in india.I
guess 30 million may be bigger than the population of
some countries.
According to reports the number of dirt poor people
another 25 million,that is those who are below the
povertly line,that means less than an income of 10 US
dollars per month.
This is what the report and statistics keep saying but
any daily wager gets a minimum 3 US dollars per
day,however poor he may be.
That accounts to 90 US dollar per month.Thats the
poorest you can find in india for a *working* person.
So its open to interpret what dirt poor really is.
That is still too less,considering the present cost of
living in india.
Open drains,diseases,insanitory conditions are still
visible in india-though its comming down very slowly.
Go to a govt. hospital,the sanitation and facilities
are poor,escpecially in villages.
A large portion of the indian community depend on
farming and its upto the 'rain gods' that they yield a
good harvest.
To eliminate poverty the govt. employs 5 year plans.
here is a detailed list of the plans
The govt. provides rations to all its citizens-that is
to buy basic essentials like rice,wheat,kerosene
etc... at a much lower prices that commercially
Schooling is pretty affordable to the poor in
government schools and there are enough govt schools
and provide free mid day meals for children.How ever
the state of govt schools are sad.
This year there were over 500 cases of food posioning
among children in one of the 27 states of india all
because of unhygenic food supplied.I am not aware of
the condition in other states.The govt. schools in
many areas have thatched roofs and some are even very
near collapsing.Some schools occupy just 1/10th of an
acre of land and some even less.
The quality of education is also pretty poor.Most
schools only teach in the local lingo and finding
english speaking people in many  regions are hard.Many
of the students emerging from govt. schools eventually
joins the labour class.
In india the average number of students that pass
tenth grade is only 50 percent of the students
appearing 10th grade.
As for politics,2 of the states in india are ruled by
the communist party of india.The case of labour class
is slighly better here but now a days corruption is at
the peak,that the ruling party and opposition party joins hands to fill up their pockets.
More over elections in india are won over simple
majority and there are over one thousand registered
parties in india.The oppoition against the ruling part
is usually high.
Rich people constitute around 3 to 5 percent of the
Rich people tend to grow very rich because India is
one country you can be 70 to 80 percent sure that any
person you approach will accept a bribe be it sales
tax,income tax or any kind of tax.
Tax evasion is very common among the rich.If you would
like to reduce your electricity bill for industries
just bribe them and they will reverse the electricity
meter for you.
If a few barrels of illicit liquor gets caught,you can
bribe them to replace it with water.You can get away
with a lot of things and make a lot of money-if you
are rich.
Atleast there is'nt much stigma in viewing the
poor.they are more or les treated as equal and well
respected.Others aren't really bothered of poor ppl.
These are just a few basic issues.the conditions in US
are much better than here.
One part is better in india-privacy rights and liberty
are much better compared to US and even if you do
small crimes you can get away with it.
I can spit on the road,i can stand on the road and
block the traffic till i just get shoved off the road
side.There is no way I get arrested.I can do a lot of
things and not get arrested.
If u get arrested-for minor crimes,you can bribe the
cop and you are freed.I never have a swat team that
breaks down my doors.The streets are guns and snipers
free.I have no surveillence cameras watching me.

@_subject: base conversion 
thank you for the reply.
If we are to convert a k-bit integer n to a base b
number,it takes us O(log n) if the base b is a power
of 2 is still a correct statement.
Say if we are to multiply a k-bit integer n with the
same k-bit integer n,  i.e multiplying integer n with k-bits by itself.
The multiplication takes atmost k^2 bit operations.
n=5=101 base 2.
i.e the multiplication takes atmost 3^2=9 bit
Thus multiplication of O(k^2) for a constant c and
All logarithms are to the base 2.
Since k=[log n]+1
k^2=([log n]+1)^2
in our example
= ([log 5]+1)^2
=3^3=9 operations.
it is correct to write O(log n)=O(k), as n or k are
the inputs to an algorithm whose time complexity is to
be determined. O(log n)=O(k)is the time the algorithm
takes for processing the input which are essenctially
the same.
yes,I was asking if there is an algorithm in O(k)=O(log n) to convert a k-bit integer n to
arbitrary base. I only know to do it in O(k^2).

In Diffie Hellman key exchange we choose a large prime
in Fp. The prime is publicly known,so is g,preferably
a generator in Fp*.
The reason that you might need to change the prime
frequently is only if you donot choose g(element of)Fp
to be a generator in Fp or the prime field be too
If the attacker knows the prime factorization of p-1,
where p-1=q_1*q_2*...*q_n,he can compute which of
 g^((p-1)/q_i)== 1 mod p and determine the order of g.
If it has a lower order, the attack is easier.
If you choose g of maximum order in Fp, then you will
have maximum security.
The diffie-hellman key exchange works under the
assumption that knowing only g^a and g^b, it is
computationaly infeasible for the attacker to
calculate g^(ab) and breaking it is conjenctured to be
as hard as the discrete log problem.

 Though Mr.Mike Morgan in the bug report attrbutes the

think it is automatic type cast form type signed char

Forwarded on request by Michael.B
Also the bug IS a very serious security issue if you
read into the bug doc, making Blowfish a very easy
crackable cipher... and yes you are right every
responsible programmer should use test vectors etc., I
do, but how do I know someone else did if I can't
review the code and have no other means of testing,
for example with (proper - see below) test vectors? And... (you really did not read into the bug-doc)...
standard test vectors DO NOT SHOW the bug. Which is
why it is such an evil one, aside the extreme security
loss. 150 products use Blowfish so far, as counterpane.org
states, and many of them don't have a verification
scheme at all. I recall a Secure Shell for example,
implementing Blowfish as an optional cipher to choose
from among others. Now with that (commercial) product
I would choose Blowfish never more since I can't
review the code or test with selected test vectors.
And this is the point. The bug thing coming directly
from Schneier does create a general distrust in
Blowfish for me.
now this is an ORIGINAL quote from the bug-describing
doc taking direct from schneier's website. next, please consider this ORIGINAL paste of the

Two conjectures (or are they?):
1. The order of an integer 'a' modulo P^m =
P^(m-1)*(Order of a mod P); where P
is an odd prime .
2. If a, m, and n are elements of Z and (a,mn) = 1,
then Order of a mod mn =
QR/(Q,R); where Q = Order of a mod m and R = Order of
a mod n and (Q,R) is the
greatest common divisor function.
For example:
Example 1:Let a =2 and P=7. Then the order of 2 mod 7
= 3 and the order of 2
mod 7^3 = 7^2(3)= 147.
Example 2: The Order of 2 mod 11^2 = 11*(Order of 2
mod 11) = 110
Example 3: The Order of 2 mod (3*7) = (Order of 2 mod
3)*(Order of 2 mod
7)/(U,V) = 2*3/1 = 6; where U = Order of 2 mod 3 and V
= Order of 2 mod 7.

NTP but that wouldn't work either.Say that the client
clock can be updated ever one millisecond. However the
minimum network delay between the time server and the
client is usually 300ms to 800 ms.During this period a
large number of outboud packets are send from the
client depending on the speed at which the client is
blasting away. There are plenty of packets to analyze
for the attacker to determine the skew.

Yes, I found it. Thankyou.
True, Its a secure MPC protocol. I confused it with
Zero knowledge protocols.
How is there information leakage?
Mr.Bruce Schneier in his book titled " Appiled
Cryptography" mentions the following MPC protocol to
compare the income of two parties, Alice and Bob
without revealing their income.
The protocol works as follows:
Let 'i' be Alice's income.
Let 'j' be Bob's income.
Let Eb be Bob's public key.
Let Db be Bob's privare key.
Let n be Bob's public modulus.
To start with we assume that the range of i and j is
from 1 to 100.
1) Alice chooses a random number x and using Bob's
public key computes
c=x^Eb (mod n)
2) Alice computes k = c-i and sends the result to Bob.
3) Bob computes the following 100 numbers
y1 = (k+1)^Db (mod n)
y2 = (k+2)^Db (mod n)
y100 = (k+100)^Db (mod n)
Bob now chooses a large prime p, such that p=2 for all i,j in the range 1
to 100. If this is not true Bob chooses another prime
and starts again.
5) Bob sends Alice the sequence in the exact order
let _ denote subscript, e.g. a_b is a subscript b.
Z1, Z2, ...,Zj, Z_(j+1) +1, ..., Z_(j+100) +1, p
6) Alice checks if the  (i th) number in the sequence
is congruent to x mod p. If yes, she concludes i<=j, otherwise i>j.
When we have the case i>j, Bob computes Z_(j+1) +1,
..., Z_(j+100) +1, this makes the (i th) sequence
Alice looks at incongruent (mod p) and makes the
protocol work. We have |zi-zj|>=2 so that the
sequences donot collide with one another.
The protocol as such donot detect cheaters in the

Looking at the Open Source Hardening Project sponsored
by the department of Hoemland Security-it says on
"The bug hunt is part of a three-year "Open Source
Hardening Project," dedicated to helping make such
software as secure as possible. In January, the U.S.
Department of Homeland Security awarded $1.24 million
to Stanford University, Coverity and Symantec to find
vulnerabilities in open-source projects.
Developers have been quick to fix many bugs found as
part of the program. More than 900 flaws were repaired
in the two weeks after Coverity announced the results
of its first scan of 32 open-source projects. "
But it appears that the money is spent only in hunting
down the bugs but not in fixing them. It says on
"It is regrettable that DHS has decided once more to
ensure that private enterprise profits from the
funding, while the open-source developers are left to
beg for the scraps from the table," he said. "Why does
the DHS think it is worthwhile to pay for bugs to be
found, but has made no provision to pay for them to be
Since Free/Open source software is widely used on
public infrastructure which is probably why the
Department of Homeland Security is funding it(to
secure it), I am wondering about the follwing
- Will an open source developer be forced to maintain
the code(with or without funds) and fix the bugs if
his code runs on public infrastructure citing reasons
such as national security? - Is the authour responsible to fix bugs in the code
(free of cost/paid) citing he is responsible to ensure
public safety?
- What does this means to licenses like the GPL. Will
it be rendered void?

@_subject: Regarding Windows Vista Disk Encryption Algorithm. 
I ran across this paper titled "AES-CBC + Elephant
diffuser A Disk Encryption Algorithm for Windows
Vista". Paper downloadable at:
There are a few questions I would like to know about.
pg 3:[ Bitlocker makes use of a tamper resistant chip
security chip mounted on the motherboard. Bitlocker
makes use of the TPM security chip that will be
incorprated in most PC's.]
How do we know if future PC's make use of this chip on
their motherboards in future and how can we trust this
pg 3.[The seal/unseal functions of the TPM allow
selective access to cryptographic keys based on PCR
values. The seal function is used to encrypt a key
into a string which can only be decrypted by that same
TPM. Furthermore, the TPM will decrypt the string if
and only if the selected PCRs have the value that was
specified during the seal operation. In other words:
we can store a key in an encrypted string so that it
can only be accessed when selected PCRs have a
particular value.
During the boot process the PCRs are used to keep
track of the code that runs. The key used to encrypt
the disk is sealed against a particular set of PCR
values. During a normal boot the PCRs reach the same
values, and the key can be unsealed by the TPM. If an
attacker boots into any other operating system, the
machine will be fully functional but the PCR values
will be different and the TPM will not unseal the key.
Thus, other operating systems cannot read the data on
the disk, or find out how to modify the disk to reset
Administrator password.]
It prevents the protected operating system from being
operational as the key cannot unlocked. The encrypted
disk can still be removed from the machine with the
security chip and re-inserted elsewhere and its
contents dumped for further analysis. Doesn't a data recovery expert usually work under the assumption that
the encryption keys are unavailable?    Isn't this the case, if we are looking at stolen
    If the disk can be removed and dumped, what
advantage does the TPM security chip provide over
software encryption?
pg 6.
[BitLocker also allows users to use a PIN that the TPM
checks, or a USB key that contains a cryptographic
key.Without the right PIN or USB key the laptop
doesn't have the right information to even find the
disk decryption key, so the information is safe unless
the PIN is written on a post-it stuck to the machine,
or the USB key is left in the laptop bag. In practice,
we expect that many laptops will be used in the
TPM-only mode and that scenario is the main driver for
the disk cipher design.]
But if we work with the assumption that the attacker/
recovery expert will not be able to find the key on
the disk ,is there any need to implement the TMP
security chip? Is the assumption reasonable?
pg 7.
[A software implementation of AES runs in around 20-25
cycles per byte on a P4 class CPU.(Synthetic
benchmarks can achieve somewhat higher speeds, but
they exclude various overheads encountered in real
system implementations.) Other overhead adds around 5
cycles per byte for a total of 25-30 cycles per byte.
Based on this data, our performance analysis concluded
that a single pass of AES, for example using AES in
CBC mode, would have acceptable performance. An
twice as slow as AES (45-55 cycles/byte) would be on
the edge of being unacceptable, and a high-risk choice
given the many uncertainties in the analysis. Anything
slower than that would be unacceptable.]
2.6 BitLocker encryption algorithm requirements
pg 7 & 8
[We get the following major requirements for our
BitLocker encryption algorithm:
It is fast enough that the slow-down of the laptop is
acceptable to most users. Our best estimate is that a
speed of 40 cycles/byte or faster will be acceptable.]
It looked like that the AES-CBC implementation was
part of the hardware security chip to speeden it up.
appears that AES-CBC is software implemented by
pg 9.
3.2 AES-CBC
[Any time you want to encrypt data, AES-CBC is a
leading candidate. In this case it is not suitable,
due to the lack of diffusion in the CBC decryption
operation. If the attacker
introduces a change 'delta' in ciphertext block i,
then plaintext block i is randomized, but plaintext
block i + 1 is changed by 'delta'. In other words, the
attacker can flip arbitrary bits in one block at the
cost of randomizing the previous block. This can be
used to attack executables. You can change the instructions
at the start of a function at the cost of damaging
whatever data is stored just before the function. With
thousands of functions in the code, it should be
relatively easy to mount an attack.]
This appears to be why the diffusers are being used.
The overview of the AES-CBC + diffusors if given in
Figure 1, pg 13.
pg 16.
[Our AES implementation uses about 20 cycles/byte for
AES-CBC on a a Pentium 4. The diffuser takes about 10
cycles/byte.The overall cipher speed is just over 30
cycles per byte, including various overhead.]
Appendix A on pg 18 gives a sketch of a proof on why
AES-CBC+Diffusers are atleast as secure as AES-CBC.
The diffusers consumes about 1/3 rd of the cycles per
byte. Given this overhead is it useful to implement
the diffusers unless the implementation can be shown
to be more secure than AES-CBC?

As you have mentioned chaining with CBC looks good
Encryption particulars: The default data encryption
algorithm is AES-128-CBC with an additional diffuser.
The diffuser is designed to protect against
ciphertext-manipulation attacks, and is independently
keyed from AES-CBC so that it cannot damage the
security you get from AES-CBC. Administrators can
select the disk encryption algorithm through group
policy. Choices are 128-bit AES-CBC plus the diffuser,
256-bit AES-CBC plus the diffuser, 128-bit AES-CBC,

   In classical cryptography, there is no way of doing
a secure key exchange without a pre-shared secret.
 Tor uses onion routing but eventually you will need a

Those who are going to school's, colleges are more

propaganda sinks in,it is easily communicated among
peers and it grows.The uneducated are also vulnerable.
So, maybe the question is-how easy it is to

AbstractbOur study analyzes the security and privacy properties
of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). Introduced
to the U.S. market in 2003, this model of ICD includes
pacemaker technology and is designed to communicate wirelessly
with a nearby external programmer in the 175 kHz frequency
range. After partially reverse-engineering the ICDbs communications
protocol with an oscilloscope and a software radio, we
implemented several software radio-based attacks that could
compromise patient safety and patient privacy. Motivated by
our desire to improve patient safety, and mindful of conventional
trade-offs between security and power consumption for resourceconstrained
devices, we introduce three new zero-power defenses
based on RF power harvesting. Two of these defenses are humancentric,
bringing patients into the loop with respect to the security
and privacy of their implantable medical devices (IMDs). Our
contributions provide a scientific baseline for understanding the
potential security and privacy risks of current and future IMDs,
and introduce human-perceptible and zero-power mitigation
techniques that address those risks. To the best of our knowledge,
this paper is the first in our community to use general-purpose
software radios to analyze and attack previously unknown radio
communications protocols.

I was looking at TOR's wikipedia entry
"Eavesdropping by exit nodes
In September 2007, Dan Egerstad, a Swedish security consultant, revealed that by operating and monitoring Tor exit nodes he had intercepted usernames and passwords for a large number of email accounts.[15] As Tor does not, and by design cannot, encrypt the traffic between an exit node and the target server, any exit node is in a position to capture any traffic passing through it which does not use end-to-end encryption, e.g. SSL. While this does not inherently violate the anonymity of the source, it affords added opportunities for data interception by self-selected third parties, greatly increasing the risk of exposure of sensitive data by users who are careless or who mistake Tor's anonymity for security.[16]"
Since a lot of people may be interested in running rouge exit nodes, why not have an optional setup where we can get rid of encrypting the traffic(i mean user data) and provide anonymity alone? It is best to take security out of the hands of the end user but in case the end user knows what he is doing and can run end to end secure services, wouldn't getting rid of this encryption(an optional provision) significantly speed up TOR?
Thank you,

The TCP header maybe encrypted if it can somehow can violate anonymity but I am referring to its payload/data here. Or am I mistaken. Does Tor nodes not encrypt the payload?

I was going through the wikipedia example of shamir secret sharing which says it is information theoretically secure.
In the example in that url, they have a polynomial
f(x) = 1234 + 166.x + 94.x^2
they construct 6 points from the polynomial
the secret here is S=1234. The threshold k=3 and the number of participants n=6.
If say, first two users collude then
1494 = S + c1 .1 + c2.1
1942 = S + c1 .2 + c2.2
clearly, one can start making inferences about the sizes of the unknown co-efficients c1 and c2 and S.
However, it is said in the URL above that Shamir secret is information theoretically secure
in the url below they say
"Secret sharing schemes such as Shamir's are information theoretically secure (and in fact perfectly secure) in that less than the requisite number of shares of the secret provide no information about the secret."
how can that be true? we already are able to make inferences.
Moreover say that, we have 3 planes intersecting at a single point in euclidean space, where each plane is a secret share(Blakely's scheme). With 2 plane equations, we cannot find the point of intersection but we can certainly narrow down to the line where the planes intersect. There is information loss about the secret.
from this it appears that Shamir's secret sharing scheme leaks information from its shares but why is it then considered information theoretically secure?
They do appear to leak information as similar to k-threshold schemes using chinese remainder theorem.

@_subject: Mark as unread - gmail and yahoo 
it has been some time since both gmail and yahoo has introduced this (Mark as unread) feature in their webmail access. if your mail account has been compromised (someone else figures your password), then the attacker can at will read your unread mail and then mark it as unread. When the 'mark as read' option was not available, a successful attacker would have to delete the unread email to do avoid detection, but then the sender will at some point of time inform the recipient about the mail that he never received.
In both cases, the attacker can still read all the mails already read by the recipient but if the recipient has the habit of deleting(including trash) immediately after reading the mail, it helps the attacker to have a mark as unread option. As soon as the mail arrives, the attacker reads it and marks it as unread. Then the recipient gets to read it and he will immediately delete it.
as far as mail clients such as Outlook goes, I think if it is deleted from webmail, it will not appear in your Outlook mail client (not sure, someone can confirm this). It may be better for security if there is no unread option.
Moreover, Gmail allows you to see the last login ip to your email and the current session ip's but that won't help if the attacker is from the same organization (with a lot of computers connecting through the same public ip) that you use to access your email.

The first visit scenario is definitely an issue. that brings it to the other question - why cannot CA's issue certificates to sites say like 10 years or 20 years and get the corresponding money for that. Most certificates issued by CA's usually have 2-3 years validity. Incase of a significant mathematical breakthrough the CA should provide an alternate secure certifying mechanism if the breakthrough occurred within the service period (10/20 years). The question is why do popular https sites not go for certificates that expire in 10/20 years if it helps security?
Another question, this one is specific to gmail - which the entire session is on https.
when i click a pdf in my gmail to be opened with google docs, the certificate is signed by google(used a third part browser plugin to check this). that is fine, however my browser never alerts me as a potential untrusted certificate and if want to add it as an exception. does that mean google is an intermediate CA or what does that mean?

From the firefox trusted certificate list it is seen that Equifax is a root CA and has issued certificate to Google Internet Authority.
This being said why does google gets certified from thawte and prsents us its certificate when we open gmail.com? The firefox browser trusts Google Internet Authority and doesnot warn of a potential untrusted site when i open a pdf from gmail(https) with google docs.

my bad.i meant disable/remove the certificate from the browser and not
'revoke' as such.
Also curious, what is the browser's audit mechanism of the CA? what safeguards
do the audit provide end users like us from malicious CA's and how is the
audit carried out?
    Is a non disclosure agreement signed between the browser and the CA?
    Doesn't the following attack model also work. Say we have rouge
intermediate CA X(trusted by the bowser) itself issuing a certificate to
BankofA.com. Note: BankofA.com never requested this certificate from CA X.
BankofA has its legitimate certificate issued by (say for example Verisign).
Now, say that is possible to carry out a MITM attack at the end user (bank's
client) ISP.
When the end user opens BankofA.com on the browser, with the MITM in place -
the fake certificate issued by CA X will be presented to the end user. The end
user's browser trusts CA X and no red flags are raised. If any monetary
transactions are carried out, all the money can be funneled out.
Thank you,

this doesn't make sense. this is more or less same as de-anonymising the
voters secret ballot.
say 3 people are contesting the election and you make negative comments about
the first and the second contestant on the internet. That pretty much means
that everyone gets to know that you are voting for the third. it defeats the
whole purpose of a secret ballot.

@_subject: Basic Birthday Paradox question 
I have a basic doubt of the birthday problem  for the case k=2, i.e 2 lists, where it is required to find a xor b =0(implies a=b; such that a is from the first list and b is from the second list).
Now, if we operate on 'n' bit values, then the basic algorithm is said to work in O( 2^(n/2) ) time and space. That is the time  and space requirement to find a collision between the two list.
What we do is fill the two lists(each) with  2^(n/2) random integers and 'JOIN' them. JOIN gives the elements that are common to both the lists.
JOIN (done efficiently) basically means sorting the two lists individually and then looking for a match between the two lists. We are assuming that we will have practical memory constrains when 'n' is large.
Sorting x elements can be done in O(x.log x) <--(1)
For e.g. if k=2 and x=256 elements; sorting takes O(x.log x) . But we store only 2^(n/2) elements in each list. Hence n=8 bits.
SO, we have 2^4 = 16 elements in each list. By eq (1), sorting takes
O(2^4 * 4) time= O(2^6) time.
Since x=256 , n=8 and we should have got O( 2^(n/2) ); i.e. O( 2^(8/2) ) =  O( 2^4 )  time complexity
there is a mismatch between the time complexities. what am I doing wrong here?

thank you. there was a small typo in the link you posted. it is
some questions.
Monkey sphere says:
Everyone who has used a web browser has been interrupted by the "Are you sure
you want to connect?" warning message, which occurs when the browser finds the
site's certificate unacceptable. But web browser vendors (e.g. Microsoft or
Mozilla) should not be responsible for determining whom (or what) the user
trusts to certify the authenticity of a website, or the identity of another
user online. The user herself should have the final say, and designation of
trust should be done on the basis of human interaction. The Monkeysphere
project aims to make that possibility a reality.
will try this out. in the meantime other questions related to browser
1. How do we know which CA's (root/intermediate) have certified a domain
2. How do we know the CA trust chain. i.e. who all are the root CA's and who
are the intermediate CA's and which root CA is associated with a given
intermediate CA?
3. Can we make the browser notify us if a domain was certified by an
intermediate CA?
4. Say domain xyz.com is certified by CA 'A' and CA 'B' whose
(root/intermediate) certificates are available in the browser. if i find CA
'B' to be malicious how can i get domain xyz.com certified by CA 'A'?

I have facebook.com logged in through one browser tab and  through another browser tab and was watching the scoreboard of the live match.  on looking closely, there is a small live chat area box within the cricinfo website discussing the game - where it identified my Facebook profile and had the facebook logout button on it. I clicked on the facebook logout button embedded on the cricinfo website and it logged me out of facebook on the cricinfo website as well as the facebook on the facebook.com website on the other browser tab.
probably this site is affiliated to facebook. i really donot wish to be identified through the facebook account when i choose to visit a website(which i might not even know is affiliated to facebook). however, there seems to be no way to disable this feature from facebook privacy settings. if anyone knows of a way to stop identifying facebook sessions on its affiliated sites, please let me know.

@_subject: Facebook is spooking me - privacy concerns 
Yes, its not a https connection. Infact, most of us are conscious of what we say on facebook. we are aware of the unknown element of being pried on without our knowledge.
  Allowing other sites to recognize us through our facebook account is a bit scary. we don't even know that the site we are visiting is affiliated to facebook or if it will identify us through our Facebook account.     A cookie may keep track of me or some info may leak from the browser - it doesn't matter much (to me). It doesn't give out the IDENTITY of the end user. Facebook here totally nails your identity to what you are looking at.
  I was expecting a Facebook privacy option to turn off this identification feature while visiting facebook affiliated sites.

@_subject: Reliably Erasing Data From Flash-Based Solid State Drives 
This may be of interest
Reliably erasing data from storage media (sanitizing the media) is a critical
component of secure data management. While sanitizing entire disks and
individual files is well-understood for hard drives, flash-based solid state
disks have a very different internal architecture, so it is unclear whether
hard drive techniques will work for SSDs as well. We empirically evaluate the
effectiveness of hard drive-oriented techniques and of the SSDsb built-in
sanitization commands by extracting raw data from the SSDbs flash chips
after applying these techniques and commands.
Our results lead to three conclusions:
First, built-in commands are effective, but manufacturers sometimes implement
them incorrectly.
Second, overwriting the entire visible address space of an SSD twice is
usually, but not always, sufficient to sanitize the drive. Third, none of the
existing hard drive-oriented techniques for individual file sanitization are
effective on SSDs.
This third conclusion leads us to develop flash translation layer extensions
that exploit the details of flash memorybs behavior to efficiently support
file sanitization. Overall, we find that reliable SSD sanitization requires
built-in, verifiable sanitize operations.

Or, much scarier, you might be on a plane and there's a problem with the board computer.
Now think what we constantly want from software: more features, better performance, cheaper prices. And we want it everywhere: in mobile phones, cars, planes, critical infrastructure, defense systems.
What do we get? Mobile phones that can be hacked by SMS. Cars that have more software problems than mechanical ones. Planes where computer problems have lead to serious incidents.

The assumption is that the user is unaware of the virus. Google wallet is either available/coming up as an Android application. It is reasonable to assume that a lot of phones running Android connect to the internet due to the way gmail,google chat,googlemaps and youtube is integrated into it. Personally, I am going to wait and watch its security for a while. There may be an issue of how this affects personal security. The user is now 'forced' to carry his wallet just by carrying his/her smartphone.

Yes, true. Also have to check the scenario as to how the card details are first entered into the phone and a malicious code already running at that time.
