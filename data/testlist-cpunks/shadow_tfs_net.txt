What if Dr.Seuss Wrote Technical Training Manuals?
                             With Apologies to Dr. Seuss
If a packet hits a pocket on a socket on a port,
And the bus is interrupted as a very last resort,
And the address of the memory makes your floppy disk abort,
Then the socket packet pocket has an error to report!
If your cursor finds a menu  item followed by a dash,
And the double-clicking icon puts your window in the trash,
And your data is corrupted 'cause the index doesn't hash,
Then your situation's hopeless, and your systems gonna crash!
You can't say this? What a shame sir!
We'll find you another game sir!
If the label on the cable on  the table at your house,
Says the network is connected to the button on your mouse,
But your packets want to tunnel on another protocol,
That's repeatedly rejected by the printer down the hall!
If your screen is all distorted by the side-effects of gauss,
So your icons in the window are as wavy as a souse,
Then you may as well reboot, and go out with a bang,
'Cause as sure as I'm a poet, the sucker's gonna hang!
If the copy of your floppy's getting sloppy on the disc,
And the microcode instructions cause unnecessary RISC,
Then you have to flash your memory, and you'll want to RAM your ROM,
Quickly turn off the computer and be sure to tell your MOM!

@_subject: UPSs 
some protection is better than none. my roommate and I have our
computers in the same room off of the same outlet but my computer has an
UPS and his does not. During a storm, lightning hit near the apartment
building and it took out his computer but not mine. But I do have a
friend who lost his computer to a direct strike to the power lines and
it took out the surge strip as well. At least in my case, it was not a
direct strike into the power lines but what happened to my roommate made
him get an UPS to at least have some protection next time. At least he
will not have to possibly shell out another $1,500 for another computer.

Well lets see, what kind of government budget are you working with or
are just indepentantly wealthy?
It takes lots o' money to get setup in satellite transmission unless you
just want to receive the info then that is as cheap as getting a used
dish and the equipment to go with it. If you plan to transmit, then the
good ol' boys of the FCC will want your money for a license. Then there
are zoning laws to check into, construction permits, concret to pour,
power for it, and oh a wife that will put up with it in the yard.
