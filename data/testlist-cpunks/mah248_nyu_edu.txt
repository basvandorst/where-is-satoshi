Bad bad bad bad bad bad *bad* idea.  This might be ok in the Russian
countryside, or any other countryside, but it an *excessively* bad thing
in just about any modern city.  If running water fails to run in the
cities, and people do as you suggest, and take their business outside,
it will not be long before tremendous numbers of people get sick and
die.  What with the high concentrations that people live in in most
cities, I expect that this'd make the Black Death look like a mild case
of the flu.
You cannot sustain a modern city without a working sewer system. Remember what cities were like in the middle ages?  I believe some
historians refer to them as "population sinks" for the surrounding
countryside.  Not for a lack of wealth or commerce, but for a lack of

Latrines aren't sufficient to the task.  In a city like NYC, latrines
might solve the problem for perhaps a week (assuming that we tear up all
the roads and sidewalks --something which we cannot do in time, even if
we wanted to), but then they'll be full, and there won't be any more
places the latrines can be rotated to.
Then we're back to doing it in the open.  Less concentrated cities might
last a while longer, but not much longer.  There's no getting around it,
we *need* working sewer systems to have modern cities.  Otherwise, the
cities die.

A temporary solution, at best.  You still have to go down to the ground
to shop, go to work, etc.  Besides, even if you don't get infected
directly from the offal on the ground, you can still be infected by
other people.  Yah, but they are pretty good at siphoning the stuff out of the city,
where people live, which is the point.  *Where* it's siphoned to may not
be the most intelligent place, but as long as it's not next to us, we
don't get sick and die nearly as often.  I'm not saying that existing
sewer systems are perfect, but they *are* keeping us alive. Michael Hohensee

This assumes that we can compress it this much, which assumes that we
have sufficient machinery.  It further assumes that we will be able to
ignore the "wet" component of human waste.  You can't just pour it down
the drains.
Next, we should realize that these latrines are themselves not going to
be particularly sanitary, and it would be most unwise to use them for
any extended period of time.  Hell, even *with* flush toilets, I've seen
people squatting down in subway stations to take a leak not more than 5
feet from the restroom.
Further, we should realize that for the above reason, people are not
going to be particularly motivated to use these latrines.  After all,
nobody wants to hold it for a long time while they wait in line to take
a leak, just for the privilege of relieving themselves in disease
central.  You're going to see shit in the street in any case.
Finally, even if we dig these holes, (and they're *going* to be bigger
than what you describe, as they must contain liquid, as well as solid
waste), we're going to end up messing up the roads something fierce. Big cities *need* roads to transport life-critical items.  If we dig
them up, we're in even worse trouble.
In the *very* short run.  Like, say, a few weeks.  That is if the food
doesn't stop coming in first --then things finish up a bit sooner.

No government can protect individual rights.  The only way one could do
so would be if it: (a) could predict the future, and act to prevent
certain futures from happening; or (b) it controls every aspect and
motion of each individual's life, thereby ensuring that nobody steps out
of line.
Unfortunately, the first scenario is impossible, given the current state
of the art, and the second results in the complete extinction of
individual rights in the name of safety (which is the ultimate goal of
the current powers that be, it seems).
All any state can do is threaten to "retaliate" against (why not just
say "attack") people who disobey its edicts.  In order for this threat
to be credible, the state must wield sufficient power to kill any
individual (or group of individuals) who would stand against it.  If it
does not have this power, it cannot govern.  The problem is, if it does
have this power, then there is nothing to stop those individuals in
control of the state from violating the individual rights of its
citizens.  As often seems the case today, for example.
The system you suggest, which I assume consists of a state with a
"minimal" amount of power, run by enlightened people, is in a state of
extremely unstable equilibrium (if it is indeed in equilibrium).  If it
wields just enough power to enforce its will, that power can be used by
evil men to increase its power.
Just look at what happened after the Constitutional coup took place in
the fledgling USA.  Remember the Whiskey Rebellion?  When we lost the
Articles of Confederation, we were taking the first steps down the road
to the tyranny of today.  The anti-federalists predicted this, although
they sorely underestimated how far it would go --assuming that it would
be stopped by another revolution.
The minimalist state has been tried.  It lasted less than a decade
before it started turning into what we have today, and what was left of
its spirit died with the war of northern aggression.
The only truly free system is one in which there is no body of people
calling itself a government which can enforce its will over the
individual.  The only way people can seem to be free living under such a
body is entirely dependent upon the good will of their masters, and this
is a shaky assumption to make.
How about:  Any action that involves the initiation of force against the
property of another person (the person belongs to himself, of course) is
This neatly tidies up the obvious question of exactly what "individual
rights" are.  There's a partial list of them in the bill of rights, but
it is not complete, by its own admission.  Furthermore, the above
definition excludes such dubious rights as the "right to an education",
the "right to welfare", etc.
All of the above involve the initiation (or threat of initiation) of
force.  Hence they are immoral, and the victims and any bystanders would
be morally justified in using force against the initiators.  Of course,
this would not be true in a governed society, where the state must hold
a monopoly on the use of force, if only to maintain its own position. Much less efficient.  Besides, putting a subset of the population to the task of defining what
is and isn't moral leads to such inanities as "homosexuality is
immoral", "premarital sex/underage sex is immoral", and "ingesting
certain compounds is immoral."  We've all got our pet peeves.  Would you like to live under mine?  Would
I like to live under yours?  Can I trust you to be tolerant?  Can I
trust your successors, 20 years from now?  Can my descendants trust
subsequent successors, 200 years later?  Experience tends to show the
The anarcho-capitalist free market is not one where "everything goes,"
and there is indeed a strong concept of individual rights.  What is
moral and not moral is defined by society on an individual basis.  The
first and only rule is:
No one has the right to initiate force against another or another's
This is the fundamental and only "social contract" we make.  Anyone who
disagrees with this is obviously antisocial, and nobody's going to want
to live with him (or allow him to continue living, if he attacks
immoral, then X is not going to be very popular with Z or anyone else,
unless he can make amends.  No one will want to trade with him, be near
him, etc.  This is a very strong motive to avoid doing immoral things.
If Y is really nasty, such as the initiation of force, then X is going
to be in *deep* trouble.  Z may well shoot him out of self defense, and
even if he survives his action, he'll have to pay a *lot* of restitution
before people will trust him again, if ever.  Law enforcement by
ostracism --read L. Neil Smith's "The Probability Broach", for a more
detailed description.  In summary, a free market is far from being an immoral market.  In fact,
it is the most moral market there is, since there is no state which
holds the "right" to initiate force.

You missed my point.  What I'm trying to point out is that no government
(or any other body, for that matter) can prevent someone from doing
something.  All the state can do (and does, if you look closely) is
offer to punish anyone who disobeys it.  It doesn't matter whether that
state is protecting individual rights or not --it can only punish, not
Correct.  There are none.  There are no collectives, only groups
comprised of individuals.  Therefore it would be meaningless to speak of
"collective" rights.
I'm explaining why it is impossible for the state to protect individual
rights. I offer two mechanisms by which the state *could* _protect_
individual rights, and then point out why they are impossible.  It is
something of a strawman argument, but if you disagree, I'm willing to
tear down any mechanism you might propose. :)
Is it really?  Then could you please explain to me exactly why I would
have to pay taxes (or otherwise make submission) to a state which did
*not* have the power to kill me?  If it lacks this power --and I mean
this in a physical sense, not a legal one-- then what is to stop me or
anyone else from telling it to fuck off?  Such a state cannot govern
those who do not wish to be governed, and so would not be a government.
Occasionally, yes.  The state does not yet have absolute power, or does
not yet choose to wield it fully in all situations.  But we've already
got an impressive list in the USA alone.  We've had Ruby Ridge, we've
had Waco, the countless raids on the homes of innocent people in the
name of the drug war (and the countless raids on the homes of innocent
drug-addicts, for that matter).
Correct, which is the main reason that we cannot trust a state in any
shape or form, regardless of how good the people running it may seem.
Actually, I wasn't thinking of Hayek at all.  ;) I was just pointing out that a "benign" state, even if it were possible
to create one (which, as you pointed out in your last paragraph, is
impossible), would not stay benign very long.  Economics is not
discussed in this portion of the argument.
Forgive me, I was trying to shorten the sentence a bit, and assumed that
"evil men" would be understood to refer to those men (and women) who
wish to rule other people, for whatever reason.  Your personal
definition of evil may vary.  Can we agree that it is wrong to rule others?  This is the fundamental
distinction which sets us apart from the statists.
The war of northern aggression is more of a reverse revolution, from
this standpoint.  The south peacefully left the union, and the north
reconquered it. It's roughly analogous to what would have happened had
the british won the american revolution.
As for the civil rights movement; it just goes to show that not
*everything* that happened after 1776 was a bad thing.  Not by the definition of a state given above.  The minimalist state must
wield sufficient power to rule those who would disobey its edicts,
otherwise it's not a state --just a bunch of losers who dress pompously
and issue meaningless proclaimations.  Anarchy is the *absence* of the
state.  You are proposing a means of setting up a benign government.  For it to
be a government, it must wield sufficient power to rule.  For it to be
benign, it must be run by "good" men (i.e. those who will not use the
state to increase their personal power).  But as you pointed out, it is
foolish to trust that the state will be run by such individuals,
regardless of who they are.  Thus it would seem that it is impossible to
create a benign state.  Thus we should avoid having one.
I used the word because the person I responded to used it.  Exactly what
is considered "immoral" does of course vary from person to person. Perhaps a better word would be "wrong", "antisocial", "socially
unacceptable", or perhaps "not to be tolerated".
No, a person belongs to him or herself.  *Someone* is directing my
actions, and guess what: it's me.  I choose what I will and will not
do.  I choose what I say.  I choose what I think.  I belong to me.
Correct.  It is wrong to initiate force against another person or their
property.  It is of course no problem if the person owning the property
gives you permission to harm it.  Then it's not initiation of force.
I agree.  This more detailed explaination of how much force should be
applied in response to an attack.  It should be small enough to ensure
that you don't accidentially end up looking like you're in the wrong
afterwards, and large enough to ensure that there *is* an afterwards. ;)
Correct.  No state can be benign if it is run by corrupt individuals. This is another example which supports the idea that the state is a bad
No, I'm describing what are obviously *not* rights.  If someone has a
"right" to an education, then that means that he has a right to get it
whether or not he can pay for it.  That is, if he can't pay for it, he
has the right to take money which belongs to other people (i.e. steal
the property of others).  (either that or he has the right to a "free"
education, which translates to him having a right to make someone teach
him without compensation, which is also theft).
The same argument applies to welfare.  If you do not agree, then what
you said about it being wrong to harm another person or that person's
property without their consent is sheer hypocrisy.
So, you're saying that you're a statist? :/
In a strictly legal sense, you are correct.  In reality, however, things
are slightly different, since there is a large supply of men with guns
who are apparently willing to execute these legally unjustified orders
--and me, if I get in their way.
When I talk about power, I'm not talking about namby-pamby _legal_
power.  I'm talking about raw *physical* power.  From a practical point
of view, what's written on a piece of paper is irrelevant if I'm
confronted with armed men who are willing to ignore it.
Why?  Is it insane not to trust in the state?  *You yourself* have
pointed out why we cannot trust those organizations called states.  If
I'm insane, you appear to be schizophrenic. ;)
You are forgetting *social* mechanisms.  You are assuming that everyone
won't care if one of their friends is hurt.  You are assuming that
people will never take action against those who they percieve to be
threatening or harming them or their friends.  These assumptions are
You misunderstand what is meant by the "initiation of force".  If I were
to attack you, it would be I who would be initiating force, not you. The force you use in response to my initiation of force would not have
initiated the conflict, thus you are not initiating force.
Nope.  Theft is an initation of force against my property.  If I happen
to be there, it would usually involve the initiation of force against
me, as I would probably desire to keep my property.
Again, I apologize for using the word "morality", since it obviously
triggers your religion button.
Afraid not.  Just because there's more than one X out there doesn't mean
that Y is still a good thing to do.  If there is a sufficient number of
Z's who are willing to ostracize any X who does Y, then X is given a
strong motivation to not do Y, lest X end up starving and alone.
If, however, very few people consider Y immoral, then X will have no
problems.  Any Z's who treat X badly for Y will tend to be shunned by X
and his friends, putting pressure on the Z's to mind their own business.
This an example of a negative feedback loop --in stark contrast to the
positive feedback associated with the level of corruption in a state.
No, I never painted it that way.  This is what *you* associate with
anarcho-capitalism.  This is not the optimal strategy.  The optimal strategy is to warn your
neighbors, or call the neighborhood security service.  You do this
because you want them to do the same for you, should you come under
attack.  This is why most primates (specifically humans) live in groups
--it's easier to see the predators coming with everyone watching, and
it's easier to fend them off if everybody picks up a stick.
Fortunately, most people are already programmed to behave in a social
fashion (the ones who weren't got eaten 40,000 years ago).  The scenario
you paint above relies on the assumption of a sudden change in human
nature, if the all protecting state were to evaporate.  This is an
incorrect assumption.  Many have been the times that people have thought
they could change human nature, and equally many are the failures.
You are overlooking common law.
Except, as I've pointed out, it is *not* the optimal strategy.  Perhaps
you would enjoy the works of Richard Dawkins.  He goes into great detail
describing exactly how nonviolent strategies are superior to violent
ones.  I'll just give one example here.
When two bears approach the same berry bush, they do not immediately
start fighting over it.  Instead, they each stick to one side of the
bush, and do not disturb one another.  Why, if your strategy is the
optimal one, would this be the case?  After all, bears are already
pretty good at attacking things.  It would be pretty easy for a
exceptional bear to break this rule, and become dominant over the other
bears, if what you say is true.
But it is obvious that bears *don't* do this.  That any bears or
ancestors of bears that ever did do this were somehow out-competed by
their peaceful counterparts.  Thus it would appear, from available
evidence, that your approach *is not* superior to the peaceful
approach.  Read Dawkins' "The Selfish Gene" for a more in-depth

It works much the same as it does today, except that there isn't a
parasitic state wasting resources on feeding a useless band of
politicians, or pointing guns at people who don't obey its whims.
Oh yeah, like they'd be much more willing to bust their butts simply to
see 50%+ of it yanked away by "regulated" (by someone else) monopolies.
You can't have malignant monopolies in an anarchy.  If any monopoly
behaved in such a manner, it would be opening itself up wide for
competition.  The only way malignant monopolies can survive is by the
use of political power (i.e. force) to keep down competitors or to force
patronage. And exactly how is your paragraph related to the one you quote above it?
Ok, I'm going to tell this to you one more time, in simple words of no
more than three sylables.  I'll even put it in caps, so you can see it
LAWS DON'T GOVERN, PEOPLE DO.  I keep pointing this out to you, and it keeps sliding in one eyeball and
out the other.  What's written on paper is *meaningless* if those in

It's what you missed in the above paragraphs.  No government can prevent
something bad (i.e. the violation of individual rights) from happening. No government can keep you safe.  All any government can do is initiate
force after the fact, and this is *not* protection.
And why would that be?  I don't see any of them words written on them
sheets of paper getting up and standing guard around *my* house.  I just
see the actions of the people who are allegedly enforcing them.  Their
behavior is not always correlated to what's written on their sheets of
I don't say that all men are bad.  I simply say that not all men are
good.  Furthermore, I say that no man is good enough to rule another.  This
applies to you, me, and everyone else. You're *almost* there.  It means that all systems of state-governance
are broke.  I propose the abolition of the state  -the lack of such a
broken system.
Wow, that's very nationalistic of you.  Nationalism wasn't always the
way people viewed the world, you know, and society existed then.
You keep saying that the state and society are somehow synonymous.  This
is simply not true  --unless you're saying that if it were not for the
existance of an organization which tells other people what to do, all
human interaction would be impossible.
Heh, if you've been listening, you'd have noticed that I never said that
governments *have* rights -only that they assert that they have them.
There are no group rights, only individual rights.  Do you agree?  If
so, then how do you resolve the contradiction which develops when you
notice that members of the state apparently have the right to do things
that non-members cannot?  Specifically, the "right" to initiate force,
and the "right" to rule others? (both of which are of course non-rights,
in my view)
*Who* punishes the punishers?  You fool, who do you think is going to
tell the highest enforcer (who supposedly wields sufficient power to
enforce anything) what to do?
*sigh* I'll say it *again*.  If the rules are going to be ignored, it
doesn't _MATTER_ how they're written.
No one ever said that.  I'm sure crime will still exist.  Robbery,
murder, etc. People go insane sometimes, some are anti-social, etc. What we *won't* have, however, are such state-sponsored crimes like
taxation, "regulatory" taxes designed to keep competition away from
state sponsored monopolies, and, of course, that highest of all crimes,
the initiation of force on a worldwide scale.
Why?  Why wouldn't the services which people obviously need and want
suddenly vanish if the state didn't exist?  People are obviously going
to be willing to pay for services they want.  You think that mail, fire
protection, etc, wouldn't exist if they weren't state monopolies?  What
evidence do you have which supports this belief?  It certainly runs
counter to all available evidence (i.e. in *every other* service which
isn't monopolized by the state).
Read to the end of the paragraph, my dear fellow, and you will be
enlightened.  You really should be a little more patient before you
shoot off your mouth.
What's that?  Someone's running outside regulation in an anarchy?  Your
comment makes no sense in this context.
They'll be able to buy it with the money they save in taxes and reduced
prices due to the lack of taxation at each step in the production of the
goods they purchase.
Then they put out the fire, lest it spread uncontrollably to houses
which *are* covered by ABC insurance.  Then they present the homeowner
with a bill, who in turn presents the bill to his insurance company.
It is in the interest of the insurance companies (who run or finance the
fire depts.) to make it easy for people to contact a fire department. (it saves on claims).  Of course, what would probably end up happening is that local fire
depts. would form, and be paid by insurance companies according to an
agreed upon rate.  A per-fire deal, if the frequency of fires is
sufficient to support this, or a flat rate (which is nicer for the
insurance companies, since they get to minimize their expenditures this
Insurance companies don't have a problem collecting lots of small fees
if they don't have to pay large ones very often.
Significantly lower, overall, since we eliminate the middleman.
Yes, but I'd rather do it *without* having a gun pointed at my head.  I
like to be able to choose which organization I want to give my money to
(rather than having the decision made for me by armed men).  Besides, money is fungible.  For all you or I know, 100% of the money
I've paid in taxes has gone to government boondoggles.
Perhaps the reason everyone hates each other so much these days is
because they all know, deep down, that they're being screwed over by (as
far as they can tell) everyone else.  And they are, via that amazing
organization, the state.

Of course not --if these services were provided in a free market.  The
problem is, they're currently provided by a monopoly which is willing to
initiate force (or threaten to do so)  against any competitors.  Look at

Quite frankly, I do not have the time (nor the space) to explain to you,
in detail, how an entire civilization operates.  In fact, any attempt by

No, the intent *is* to make the system better and more equitable.  It's
just that we don't favor the socialist definition of "equitable".
We support voluntary systems, not coercive ones.
Except that it's personal improvement for *everyone* (except for tyrants
and other politicans, but we didn't like them much anyway).
Our proposals do not leave things up to chance any more than the current
system does.  In fact, it can be argued that our system leaves less up
to chance than yours does.  Lets do a comparative analysis.
In today's system:
1:  	Social Ill exists.
2: 	Social Ill is identified by someone.
3:	That someone makes a lot of noise, and lobbies the state to supply
money to finance the correction of the Social Ill.  This is done by
convincing a majority of voters in some election or other, which may not
take place for at least a year, that this Social Ill is very important
--more important than all the other Social Ills.
4:	Someone who wants the Social Ill corrected gets into power, and
proceeds to try to correct the Social Ill with a huge rumbling
centralized governmental machine.  This often excacerbates the Social
Ill, rather than correcting it.
The net result:  The Social Ill is not likely to be corrected until the
next election, and will be paid for by taking more money away from
everyone else (since the state gets its money from taxpayers, and cannot
create value out of thin air).  Even worse, the person lobbying for the
correction of the Social Ill may not get into power, since he may have
lost the election to someone who used lots of money to make him look
bad.  Thus, the Social Ill may not get corrected for some time, if ever.
Under a truly free system:
1:	Social Ill exists.
2:	Social Ill is identified by someone.
3:	That someone makes a lot of noise, alerting everyone else to the
existance of this Social Ill.  Those who agree with the first someone
will contribute time, money, and resources to correcting this Social
Ill.  4:	Social Ill is dealt with in the most effective manner possible, since
people will be free to try to correct it in any number of ways, and will
of course prefer to contribute their money to an effort that has the
best effect.
This is an improvement upon today's system.  We no longer need to have
the majority of voters approval to start correcting the Social Ill.  All
we need is a group of people who are willing to support the correction
of the Social Ill.  This makes the most sense, since we obviously don't
need to draw on *everyone'* resources to correct every Social Ill.  (of
course, some rare Social Ills will be that large, but the larger the
Social Ill, the more people wil recognize it as such.)
Better yet, frivilous problems (i.e. those invented for the advancement
of some politician's career, or out of sheer stupidity) will not have
large amounts of resources wasted upon them.  Only the most blind and
stupid of people would contribute to the correction of nonexistant
Social Ills (of course, that is their right, but at least nobody else
will have to waste their money, if they don't wish to).

I love you, too.
If they wield no real power, and proceed to do whatever is best for them
in the short term, they will be screwing themselves over in the long
term (or short term, if doing what they want results in someone shooting
them in self defense).
And precisely what dirty deeds has Mr. Gates ever done?  Excluding those
actions in which the judicious use of state regulation was involved.
Yah, and then somebody else points a gun at Mr. would-be warlord and
goes Bang, Bang, he's dead  (it's unsafe having warlords about --sorta
like scorpions).  That is, if Mr. would-be manages to shoot me without
being shot himself.
It hasn't happened yet.  But then, neither had the USA, before 1776. The above is not a reasonable argument.
You can, of course, as me how it *could* happen.  And unfortunately,
you're partially correct, it couldn't happen under current conditions. The amount of personal firepower that is easily accessible by everyone
is not sufficient to back up the soverignity of each individual.  It's
all linked to whether weapons technology is such that individuals can
operate weapons which are just as effective as those wielded by highly
trained and specialized groups.  The pendulum of weapons tech. swings
back and forth over time.  During the American Revolution, the pendulum
was on the side of individuals, as can be shown by the fact that the
revolutionaries were carrying better weapons than those carried by
professional soldiers, and could use them to equal or larger effect.
Today, of course, the pendulum is on the other side.  Tanks, fighter
planes, aircraft carriers, etc are where it's at.  Read "Weapons Systems
and Political Stability" by Carroll Quigley, for an interesting analysis
on the subject.  Of course, the pendulum keeps on swinging, and there are some
indications that it's moving back.  For example, anti-aircraft missiles
have gotten so small that they can be carried by one man.  In any modern
war, planes had better be damned careful of what they fly over, lest
they get a missile up their rears.
So, all we need right now is to produce either a convienient
impenetrable shield, or perhaps high-energy weapons.  When one man can
take out a tank with an inexpensive handweapon, we'll be all set. :)

But how can you plausibly threaten the power of he who has the most
power?  That would imply that a greater power exists -if so, how do we
control those who wield *it*?  Checks and balances don't work if those
in power aren't willing to check others in power (because, for example,
they're on the same side).
So?  As long as he doesn't initiate force against anyone, I see no
reason why he should be physically prevented from doing what he does.  I
dislike the way he operates, but neither I nor anyone else has the right
to initiate force upon him to stop him, so long as he doesn't initiate
force himself.
My solution to the problematic behavior of Mr. Gates is not to patronize
him wherever possible, to within a certain level of convienience.  For
example, I do not run MS software on my system --it sucks compared to
Other people hate microsoft even more, and actively work against it. These people either work for competing companies, agitate the public to
shun microsoft, or write good open source software, in an attempt to
remove microsoft's market.
How?  What rights have been violated?  Did he at any time initiate force
against any of these workers?  Did he hire soldiers to storm into
competitors' offices to murder and destroy everyone and everything?  If
he has, I certainly haven't heard of it.
I suspect that any "rights" which you think have been "violated" turn
out to be non-rights, if you're anything other than a socialist.  (which
you may very well be  --in which case, you'd be irrational and very good
at doublethink, making intelligent argument futile)
I do not agree with this appraisal, and do not care, as long as he
doesn't initate force, or use the state to initate force.  Until then,
he has as much right to do what he does as you have to do whatever it is
that you do.
But my point all along is that anyone who takes a gun and tries to take
something *is* likely to face retribution --either from those he steals
from, or from others who don't wish to be robbed by him.  This
retribution can take many forms, ranging from death, to ostracism, to a
lowering of his reputation, depending upon how severe his crime was.
You just haven't been reading what I've been saying, have you?
Such events would be rare, since it's pretty easy for all parties
concerned to figure out the likely result of such an exchange.  Mr.
would-be-warlord will probably not act on his desires, since he knows
that it would at best drop his reputation through the floor, and at
worst, result in his death.
Unless of course, he's a real lunatic  -in which case, he'd have gone
out and attacked someone anyway.  It's actually better this way.  At
least we don't have to worry about intelligent would-be-warlords
manipulating the state to do their dirty work for them. In sum, the possibility of getting killed tends to put a damper on the
would-be-warlord population.
Ok, then think of it this way.  Instead of having one big, centralized
state, where orders are given from on high, and are thus frequently
inequitous to lowly individuals, let's go for a more evenly distributed
model.  Let's carry this distribution to the point where everyone
governs himself and his property.
Previous attempts at such things would have failed, since humaity lacked
communications systems which were fast enough to link such a system
together.  Previous forms of government all reflect this fact.  Communication was
always very centralized, and thus governance had to be as well, to keep
everyone up to speed on what's going on.  As communications technologies
improved, states have become more and more decentralized.  (go from the
mesopotamian warrior-kings, to Rome, to monarchy, to parliamentary
government, to the US).  And today, we are presented with the internet --the ultimate in
decentralized, near instantaneous communications.  We aren't very far
from making it possible for anyone, anywhere, to communicate with anyone
else, wherever they may be.  Obviously, this makes it possible to
progress even further by decentralizing things even more!
The net result is indistinguishable from anarcho-capitalism.  I'd be
satisfied with it.  Do you like it better from this angle?
No, but you couldn't have cited the United States before it existed
Only if you persist in confusing society with the state.
Nope, it's based on *reality*.  The only way to ensure that no one will
inflict violence upon you is to be capable of inflicting at least as
much violence upon any attacker.  What I'm telling you is that if the
above conditions exist, violence will become a very unhealthy trade, and
will not be practiced by anyone aside from the occasional lunatic who
wants to commit suicide in an interesting fashion. I beg to differ.  It would appear that *you* just don't get it.  Re-read
what I've said in the light of my above paragraph, and see if you come
to the same conclusion.
I agree that war destroys infrastructure, and is not going to cause
widespread economic growth.  I never said otherwise.  But lets look at
war for a moment, hmm?
Those who start wars usually do so because they think they can win them,
am I correct?  It would be insane to do otherwise.  If conditions were
such that nobody could be sure of winning, there would be very little
incentive to start a war, don't you agree?
Of course, in reality, wars are started between nations by their
leaders, who supposedly act on the behalf of their people.  It is
currently possible for the leader of a nation to have an incentive to
start a war which his country cannot win, so long as *he* profits by it -in terms of money, power, etc.  As long as he doesn't lose personally,
he can do whatever he likes (if he's sufficiently amoral, which we must
assume that some leaders will be).  This is not the same on an individual level, however.  It is never in
the interest of the attacker to attack someone unless he can be
reasonably sure of winning.  The attacker cannot divorce himself from
the results of his actions, as the leader of a nation can, because he
cannot separate his being from his body in any effective sense.  That
is, if his body loses the fight, he's screwed.
The point you raise would seem to be yet another argument for
anarcho-capitalism.  It would appear that preople have even more
incentive not to hurt each other under those conditions than under
present ones.
This is untrue.  Organized government is not necessary for the
maintenence of infrastructure.  See my other posts, or "The Market for
It is an impossible task, as my discussions with Jim Choate have shown.
I've offered plenty of validation.  You haven't bothered trying to
invalidate these validations, which would be the only way you could
logically disprove my arguement.  Instead, you've deliberately or
unconsciously misunderstood or misread my arguements until they fit in
with what you wanted me to have said.  At which point, you spewed forth
whatever canned response you had ready for what you wished I'd said.
You would be correct.  I like to count myself among them.  I have no
desire to hurt or be hurt, rule or be ruled.
100% correct.
Incorrect, for the above reasons.
We don't really disagree on the fundamentals.  I suggest that you take a
very close and unbiased look at the points where we seem to disagree.  I
suspect that upon closer examination, you will come to the same
conclusions that I have.  It all hinges on being able to think about
*why* the state might be the only possible solution to various
problems/required services.  This is usually very difficult for most
people, as they've had those beliefs drilled into their skulls since
they were young.  I've found that it's much like a religion, in some
respects.  At least, all the arguments I've ever had with religious
people on the topic of their religion kept ending up much like our
current discussion).  I've since realized how pointless it is to have
such religious arguments.  I haven't given up on politial arguments,
however, and I hope I never have to.  The result is unpleasant to think
Good luck, and watch out for doublethink!

Now wait a minute, which side was it that said that an "anarchistic
society" was an oxymoron?  You know, that we can't have a society
without a state?  The state is nothing but an organization which kills
anyone who doesn't obey its will (however that will is determined, or
however many orders it will give you before disobedience is fatal).  By
saying this, you *are* saying that it is necessary to "have a social
institution that announces that it has the job of killing anybody who
competes with it or fails to obey its proclamations of the will of the
majority" in order to have *any* social institutions (i.e., to have a

Is that so?
Are you saying, then, that you aren't in favor of the "right to medical
care", you were so big on earlier?  You're saying that you don't support
taxation to pay for this universal medical care?  That's not what you
said before. :)
Since when have we said this?  Just because I'm not *obligated* to help
someone doesn't mean that I'm going to do anything to make his/her life
worse.  The lack of an obligation to help does not necessarily imply the
existance of one to harm.
Furthermore, if you'd bothered to read Anon's next paragraph (and you
must have, you cut it out), you'd have seen an example of why it is in
one's self-interest to help one's neighbors.  We respect others because
doing so increases the odds of their respecting us.  This isn't a
particularly complicated line of reasoning, and just about everyone
understands it (unless, of course, they're anti-social statists, who
imagine that force is the best solution to every interaction).
You really *do* have a reading disability, don't you?  Here, I'll quote
what you appear to have missed:
:All that being said, it may be in my own best interests to do "what is
:best" for my neighbor; then, if my house should catch fire, I have a
:much better chance that my neighbor will help extinguish the fire.
Ok, Jim, here it comes.  The meaning of this paragraph is: to help
others is to help oneself in many cases.
You think we don't recognize this fact?  Hell, we *rely* on it.
Read the entirety of someone's post without reading what you *want* the
author to have said into it.  Hell, just try reading *all* of a post

As far as I know, the only bio-weapon test that occured in San Francisco
was when they scattered some large volume of apparently harmless
bacteria over the city in order to find out what effect a bio-attack
would have on them, and to get an idea of what countermeasures are
useful, and of course, to test their own delivery systems. :)
I don't know what kind of bacteria they were, so I've no idea if they
were harmless or not.  Suffice to say that a bunch of people in San
Francisco think they weren't (harmless), and get upset about it
It seems unlikely, however, that the few deaths that people have tried
to attribute to the bacteria were actually caused by them.  San
Francisco is a big city, with lots of people.  If the bacteria really
were dangerous, *manY* people would have died, rather than the handful
(10-15?) that did in fact die, for one reason or another.

This still doesn't explain why you think you need 100 accounts on the
same ISP.  All an account is is a login/password pair.  wtf do you use
100 *different* accounts for?  Email bombing?  Some kinda sick means of
avoiding spam mail from posting on Usenet? *rototflmao*
I suppose that if your ISP has 100 computers on its internal network,
and your login works on each one of them, you could say, technically,
that you have 100 accounts.  Of course, since your ISP is probably
running Solaris, that's a somewhat silly thing to say, as it is likely
that the /etc/passwd (or equivalent) file is NFS mounted over the whole
network, and your home directories are almost certainly NFS mounted from
a constant HD (located somewhere in the depths of the network), from
machine to machine.
Hell, I worked at Sun over the summer.  *I* had an account there, and
could login to any of the several hundred machines we had on our subnet
of SWAN.  Does that mean that I should go around saying "Yeah, I have
like, 500 shell accounts where *I* work, which proves I'm a VSC (Very
Smart Cookie), or at least not an AOLuser" *lol*
Get over it kid, you've either got a single account, which exists on a
bunch of different machines, or your ISP is even more retarded than AOL.

What part of "or equivalent" don't you understand?  If you don't already
know, even in a shadowed system, the encrypted passwords reside
*somewhere*.  If you knew that already, you have again raised an
irrelevant point in your attempt at a defense.
Me: 2
You: 0
So?  I was just giving an example of what it is to have an account on a
network which uses NFS.  I won't even bother awarding myself a point for
this one, but you lose one, for such a pointless statement.
Me: 2
You: -1
Ohhhh, I see.  You really *do* have 100 different logins!  Now, back to
my original question: "Wtf do you use 100 different accounts for?"
Hmm, so what you're essentially saying is, you're doing some stuff that
might get your account disabled (such as email bombing, spamming,
posting moronic stuff to usenet, or downloading too much kiddie porn).
Now let's all think really hard for a second.  Who could possibly be the
cause of any disabling that occurs to this fellow's account?  Could it
be, the ISP?  *YES*, (you win a cookie).  Now, if the ISP's sysadmin
looks at this fellow's account and says, hmm, I'm going to disable this
loser's account, mightn't that very same sysadmin think to himself,
"ooo, look at this, the guy's got 99 other accounts.  Maybe I'd better
disable them, too, otherwise, disabling this one account won't have much
of an effect."
Ok class, it's time for a quiz.  In the scenario above, what kind of
good would having 100 different accounts at the same ISP do you?  The
answer?  Absolutely None.
No no, I understand completely.  You're an idiot.  :)
Oh, you're using it *illegally*?  Why didn't you say so *before*?  In
that case, my flaming becomes so much easier.  When your (unwitting) ISP
disables one of your accounts, they will very likely run a check on
their system for any other little nasties which may be around.  (as they
will assume that their system has been compromised at superuser level)
They will very easily find the accounts which shouldn't technically
exist, and delete them.  If, on the other hand, you've just found the passwords for a bunch of
otherwise legitimate users, you'll be screwed when the ISP sends an
email to all the users telling them to change their passwords.
Because having X number of extra accounts at a single ISP will *not*
give you anything to fall back upon when one of them is disabled.
But don't worry, I seriously doubt that you have the knowledge necessary
to do anything more obnoxious than send foolish emails to the
cypherpunks list.

@_subject: Democracy... (fwd) The Nature of Religion 
Actually, you may be interested to know that *everyone* is religious, in
some manner.  Everyone has at least one untestable assumption about the
world.  That is, everyone has a kind of faith.  Let's give some
Christians believe that there exists a Being, called God, which somehow
created the universe and guides (or not, depending on whether or not
you're a Deist) its development.  Furthermore, they believe that Jesus
Christ was the son of God.  This is an untestable assumption.  Nobody
can *prove* that God exists.  They simply choose to act on the
assumption that He does.
Moslems believe in the existance of a different God, and have different
rules and details in their religion, but their fundamental assumption is
the same.  God exists.  God created the universe.  They can't prove any
of it, but they nevertheless choose to act as if it is true.
Atheists believe that God *doesn't* exist, which is essentially the same
kind of belief that is described above.  If you can't prove that God
*does* exist, you can't prove that He doesn't exist either.  This is
their untestable assumption about the universe.
Even people who are nonreligious, or agnostic, have a religion.  For
them the question is not whether or not God exists,--they don't know one
way or the other-- but whether or not the *universe*, (the external
world) exists apart from themselves.  After all, if I choose to believe
that the universe doesn't exist, and is instead some dream that I'm
entertaining myself with, there is no test you can perform which can
convince me otherwise.  Similarly, if I choose to believe that the
universe *does* exist apart from myself, there is no test that can be
carried out what will convince me otherwise (because, if it *doesn't*
exist, I must be very good at decieving myself).
The Transcendentalists of the 19th century, for example, do not really
believe that the universe exists apart from themselves.  They believe
that the human mind (or, more specifically and honestly, their minds)
are what governs the way the universe works.  To them, when men
"discover" new effects in nature, those effects are a direct result of
the discovery.  That is, that the belief in the effects are what cause
the effects.  To them, the map is the territory.
Scientists tend to think differently.  Their beliefs can be described by
those laid out in General Semantics.  "The map is not the territory; the
word is not the thing."  That is, the universe exists *apart* from our
conceptions of it.  This is my personal religion.  I begin from the
fundamental assumption that the universe does in fact exist apart from
myself, and base all further beliefs on that.  I personally feel that this philosophy is one of the most mature and
socially responsible ones in existance, because, knowing that the
universe is not in fact something I've dreamed up, I know that other
people are emphatically *not* mine, and that I have no natural right to
impose my will upon them in any coercive way.  This is quite different
from the stance that many God followers and Transcendentalists take.
But then, that's just my biased point of view, since I'm religious and
everything. :)
