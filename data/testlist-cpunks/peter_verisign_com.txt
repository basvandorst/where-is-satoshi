Its nice to see a carefully reasoned argument.
Consider, also reading
  The thesis is fundamentally flawed in the case of publickey applications
which provide or exploit digital signatures, as its assumptions are false,
patently. However, a gem of truth is revealed; however, possible outcomes
may be unpalatable as "pay-per-view".
Crypto metering for commercial-grade systems is easy. A number of companies,
including those who are bantering about the latest batch of payment protocols, are beginning to really understand that to combat intruder-in-the middle
attacks of the commercial end-systems' keying material, its necessary to
authenticate the source of keying material used for all subsequent security services. Contrary to
the thesis, there are an ever evolving number of practical ideas upon the nature
of security services and secure applications. (In fact, its ever harder to track
the explosion of innovation which is actually happening.)
To combat the threat which intruder-in-the-middle represents to the key
exchange/agreement crypto underlying most applications, a notion of public-key
certificates was formulated. The certificate is a certified end-system key. The evaluation of the certificate requires users to consider trust models, as
someone "trusted" digitally signs the key to assert that the key is certified
for purpose X. The number of trust models being propounded is astounding; the
innovation wonderful to behold; contrary to the thesis. Two models are
prevalent - the Kent RFC 1422  model which uses third-parties to base non-repudiation services,
and the  Zimmermann PGP model which does not use third-parties, and accomplishes
something other than non-repudiation. Other models are in heated discussion!
There is a little truth in the thesis that asserting upfront to the
licensor the nature of your idea does hamper innovation. However, a solution
maybe at hand. Note, anyway, that (a) RSA is an excellent public-key scheme which is free of patent restrictions anywhere in the world except US territories (b) personal use of RSA in the US is effectively unlicensed (see
PGP/PGPfone) (c) RSAREF is a free reference implementation available for
developers to  innovate with, before deciding how to make their ideas
commercially available (d)  there are lots of competitive providers of RSA stuff supporting
many form-factors  and packaging styles. So either all innovation occurs in the
US, else free public availability is not the key to idea generation. Both these
conclusions are  patently wrong, in my view.
Whats a solution?
Well there is a solution which gets rid of the up-front, tell-all requirement.
Its called controlled certificate issuance. Given the importance of the
certificate role, if one meters certificate issuance such that a postage-stamp
fee goes to the licensor for each key used in any idea, for any purpose, however often or valuable-a-transaction, then the developer is effectively freed up - in terms of innovation. The keying material can be Diffie-Helman,
anything the developer like.
Whats the downside - well its like having a pay-per-view box on your company
TV. Still,
this is highly regarded by many industries and is the basis of much
competition in the broadcasting & programming distribution industry. Some
people, really object to pay-per-view. But then, some people object to
inventors getting benefit from their discovery. One metering product is the BBN
safekeyper. Metering certificates causes about as much hate mail, as MIT patent
enforcement though. So beware about even thinking about reading the following
pages for more information about the options and issues:  - for digital ID material (lots of  - for metering and "simple" licensing
How do we do away with the say-it-all-up-front restriction, which is currently
the only means whereby the licensor can collect a negotiated fee?
RSA DSI invested heavily in a hardware product for metering the issuance of
those critical certificates. That is, any developer w

You might wish to look at the Apple DigiSign design. RSA DSI ran a CA
under contract as a notary enrollment system for 2 years. The people from
RSA DSI,
now at Verisign, have a certain amount of experience with this system.
I dont understand how you intend to make CA spoofing illegal. Who
who perform the enforcement? (By illegal, I assume you mean that
there is a criminal offence involved, rather than a tort.)
This has been tried, and many certificates issued under a variant
of this scheme. it seems likely that only an ABA-certified notary
would be reasonaby secure from professional liabilities. Good
efforts have been made to qualify what the professional procedures would
be. Notary fees might be best controlled by the notary, not the CA. Seems
an unreasonable restriction of trade to price-fix, even at the low-end.
There is indeed a large body of legal ramifications in this
area. The best way to learn about it is to become a CA and do it. Risk
taking is part of being in the CA business, however you operate it,
even for free.
Running as a not-for-profit may not prevent general liability. You can
give the service away for free and will still be liable for the
mis-representations you or your agents make. There are DARPA reports written
the issue (though these do not usually constitute advice.)
Navigator betas seem to already facilitate users configuring their own
trust points in a manner rather similar to adding a key to your
personal PGP keyring.
IBM browsers allow formal configuration of trust points.
CAs as a business and economic growth area are just happening. We have
two declared companies; Verisign and GTE. I personally expect another
10-20 to declare soon. The large (phone company) networks seem to
be where the current action is, followed by the large accounting firms. As
a small software company, I personally back the other similarly
small software companies making and selling organizational CA
systems to help people manage their own community of interest as
they see fit.
