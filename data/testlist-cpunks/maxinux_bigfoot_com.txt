@_subject: Power Outage in San Fransisco/bay area 
Well, we are going on hour 4 now, most of the power is back.  One group of
2-4 employees caused it they say.  This was admitted 3 hours later, and
then they knew 15 minutes after it happens.. typical.  They expect to be
back on by this afternoon
On the Shell Building at 8:30AM
"Building closed, no power.  Power will not be restored for 6-8 hours."
I wonder how they knew.  The estimate is probably about right too, wierd.
The mission village sub-station has been re-oppened, and most peoples
power is now being revived.  Funny how 2-4 people not following procedure
were able to shut down 4 substations.  Looks like PG&E have lots of work
ahead to find out the cause/effect of this type action.

No horror stories of bestcrypt, but I hear that PGPdisk is damn dope,
except for two things.  The crypto 'file/partition/whatever' is static in
size, not dynamic, and it does _not_ use your pgp key.. But it looks like
it should still be neat.. I still like CFS for  linux :-)

Well, They were automagically put back on the list when NAI bought TIS,
this has no baring on PGP at all.  Source code is in stores, and being
scanned as we speak, the PGP developers would not let them initiate any
KRAP stuff with pgp, they value there dignity and integrity.

MY only question in regards to this topic are these:  How many members of this mailing list have been selected for search?  How many of these are NOT registered republicans or democrats?
While I was selected (both going and returning to Ca) I talked to people at the table, none of them were dems or repubs (I was registered libertarian, one guy was green and another libertarian). Is there algorithm really "What are they registered to vote"?

These things are TOUGH MOTHER FUCKER that go big boom.
EIELSON AIR FORCE BASE, Alaska (AFNS) -- A B-2 Spirit bomber dropped two B61-11 bomb shells to test their improved ground penetration capability March 17 at the Stuart Creek Impact Area, 35 miles southeast of Fairbanks.
The tests here were designed to measure the nuclear bomb casing's penetration into frozen soil and the survivability of the weapon's internal components.
These were the final two tests needed to certify the weapon system as A team excavated the two unexploded dummy bombs and took careful measurements of their angles and depth of penetration into the soil, which were 6 and 10 feet, according to Ellsworth Rolfs, a B61-11 program test manager. The shells were sent back to Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico for full analysis of how the simulated internal components fared in the impact.
"The test unit casing didn't rupture in any of our tests, including drops through concrete from 40,000 feet," he said. "We fully recovered all test units 100 percent intact."

Many molds (stachybotris, is what I have the most experience with, for one) would need much more bleach than that as  the water will make the molds grow more.  Besides many molds live _in_ the walls not on them, there will always be holes, i.e. the floor.  So you know, my experience with this is 3 years of vollunteering at an elementary school I used to live near.
Crescent Elementary in Suisun California.  If you want more info, drop me a line this topics getting a lot of attention already, so it must be a cypherpunk topic.
