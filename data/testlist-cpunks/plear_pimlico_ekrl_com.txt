@_subject: Announcing SecureDrive 2.4 (fwd) 
Does anyone have any experience with the SecureDrive program and if so can you make any comments about it?
I've been looking for something like this for a while and I'd also like to know which other programs compare / are better / are worse if any.
Thanks for any input ...

@_subject: Locked out of Quicken - HELP! 
I recently created a new file in Quicken and used a password to protect it from prying eyes (I know ... it isn't very strong encryption ... and I hope it isn't) but now I can't remember the @ password.
Does anyone have any suggestions regarding how to break in?
