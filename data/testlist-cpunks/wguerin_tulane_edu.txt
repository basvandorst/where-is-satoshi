CarBomb Rips Berkeley California
A large though prude carbomb rips through the student community of Berkeley, CA at exactly 4:20 am pacific time on friday Dec. 12th.
Friday December 12th, 4:20am Pacific, Berkeley California:
The device, a 10 element remotely detonated carbomb rips through the dense student populated section of Berkeley, CA less than 4 blocks from the southwest corner of the UCB campus.
An audio recording by a student preparing her oral component of a final documents the sequential detonation of a 3-element primary fired by a tap off the vehicles car horn security system, followed by between 5 and 8 secondary charges detonated presumably by burnout. Students in the area have exactly 2 comments on the event:
Most living in the adjacent appartments say in a monotonic way: "I'm sorry, I do NOT know what you are talking about." and a limited few others, also from the same areas, say "I am not at liberty to discuss these issues."
Students from the surrounding appartment complexes are concerned about the excessive secrecy regarding this explosion that woke over half the people within a quarter mile radius, early friday morning.
The explosive elements, after audio analysis, appear to be roughly equivalent to 10 cases of TNT.
At least one Berkeley Police Department officer has said that they had a "NO RESPONSE VECTOR" during and prior the time of the explosion. This author has not yet determined the meaning of this phrase.
Numerous appartment complexes in the surrounding area have had multiple unexplained fire alarms and other strange activities in the last few days.
No mass media coverage or documentation has been available to this author, and most parties researching this event are hesitant to discuss for obvious (forwarded - WLG)
