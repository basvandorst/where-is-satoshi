You always have similar concerns with any closed source software (or even
open source you haven't audited yourself). Or am I missing a new problem
that occurs with auto-updates?

All valid points I wish I had thought of.
The generic off line update could very easily detect the user once
installed and update itself to a backdoored version as needed.
