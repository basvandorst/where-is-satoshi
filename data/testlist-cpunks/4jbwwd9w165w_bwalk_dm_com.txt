Actually, it has nothing to do with speech. Mr. Gilmore owns the machine, and
allows the list to be run from it. At any time he could stop allowing the
list from being distributed from his machine, as would be his right.
If he does not want someone using his resources, it's his right. The fact
that you're the only (someone correct me, was Detwieler also kicked off?)
or one of the only people that has been removed from the list due to
abusive behavior speaks volumes.
As to the cries of censorship and peoples rights being violated, I'd contend that rights are not a zero-sum proposition. The minute a person
exercises a right, some other person does not lose a right, or have a right violated. What some people would assert is a right (list membership) is actually a privilege granted by the owner of the resource.
