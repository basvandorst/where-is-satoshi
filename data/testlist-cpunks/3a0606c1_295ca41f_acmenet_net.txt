Not a question of wisdom- the 14th basicly says, thou shalt no longer make state laws that ignore the constitution.  Note- this didn't happen until the civil war.  Prior to this it was well understood that states could pass whatever laws they darn well pleased.
Something that many don't realize is just how much the constitution/our government has been molded and changed since it's creation.  In it's original form it was very clearly treated as a tool of the states, not the people.  It was given just enough strength that it's decisions could be made to stick if a decision went against a particular state (this was the problem with the articles of confederation).
LOL.  It's a priority queue, designed for easy distribution of labor when the proverbial sh*t hits the fan.
