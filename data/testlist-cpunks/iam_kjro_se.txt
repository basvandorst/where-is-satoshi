Put the server into the hands of a third party outside of the US. Have
that 3rd party have total and absolute rights to the SSL root
certificate and your party to not have any capacity to force said party
to hand over the certificate. You use it, but you don't have any ability

Legally rolling them would defeat the point of the request and thus likely
out you in contempt.
The only solution is to not have the private key itself available to you
and design the system such that you don't need it to do the minimal job
Adminning the server.
It's like having no logs. You can't give away something you don't have. The
solution is to design the systems so Americans simply don't have access to

On Tuesday, February 25, 2014, Cathal Garvey I guess this is one painful way to learn why banks and other financial
institutions have very bureaucratic but very well established techniques
for handling money and don't work with systems that were tosses together
over a few weeks.
Almost everything that seems to have happened is an example of either
inexperience with proper bookkeeping or a complete disregard for
established techniques in banking software.

I find it somewhat ironic that they are shutting things down to avoid a run
on the bank. They can't go to fractional reserves without essentially
upsetting the ideology of many of their users and they cannot let their
users take money out because they didn't implement the most basic
accounting procedures for these things.
Sadly, this is the precise reason banks are generally heavily regulated.
Without that regulation, corners get cut and millions of dollars get stolen
with no recompense.

They were given the coins by people who trusted them and their code to not
be easily manipulated. Their code was crap and didn't do the tracking
properly. They didn't steal the coins, they screwed up the code by not
ensuring that it was to the level of quality needed for such a high amount
of finance moving through it. This is not theft, it's incompetence. This is
closer to your bank leaving it's vault open or, in the case of Target,
accidentally having all of the credit card numbers stolen.
The problem here is that it is cheaper in the short term to create crappy
code security-wise and push it live than it is to create code that is
actually properly implemented for a banking environment to handle both the
large amounts of money and the quite serious number of attacks that will
take place once the amount of money available is established.
In a competitive environment, the folks who take short cuts will save money
in the short term, and thus will be more likely to pick up users than a
more expensive equivalent that actually did the security correctly.
Regulations in this circumstance only have the effect of ensuring a certain
level of quality and security for the end consumer by levelling the playing
field to a certain standard.

The NSA has an almost unlimited budget. I could easily see them being
used in this fashion. Especially since if bitcoin was being used by the
official enemies of the US, it would allow the NSA to directly screw
around with them.
True, but the mining needs to happen in the open somehow.
Actually, someone mentioned the fact that they could just do the "think
of the children" CP/Drugs line, and that would resolve the problem more
or less in the public eye. Especially when you combine that with
"proceeds of a crime" laws, arguably turning a bitcoin into a similar
object as a stolen stereo.
In China and other similar countries they are dealing with it in a more
direct manner, essentially telling people that if they continue to use
it there will be severe consequences. Hence why the banks in China
backed out so quickly.
Unfortunately, utopian thinking is commonly wishful thinking, that's why
so many bad things happen when utopian extremists start to get their way.

there is a lot more to the equation than simple coding up some crappy ruby
code and putting fixes in place whenever it doesn't quite do what you want.
Financial cryptography is expensive to do mostly because there is a strong
