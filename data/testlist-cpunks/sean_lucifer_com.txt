Democracy works because it recognizes the power of a majority.  If a
leader's policies are at odds with the will of the majority, sooner or later
they will rise up against him/her.  If you will allow me to throw a cliche
back at your "tyranny of the majority", how about "might makes right"?  Or
as Churchill said (more or less), "Democracy is the worst possible form of
government, except for all the others."
Notice that "might makes right" does not imply that any education is necessary.

@_subject: CDA outside US (Including Indian Reservations) 
This is not an idle threat.  When Pierre Trudeau was elected prime minister
of Canada (1969?) there was some scrambling in the US to get him off the
_persona non grata_ list.  Seems that in his student days he had been busted
for trying to kayak from Florida to Cuba.  Canadian author Farley Mowatt
(sp?) was turned back at the border for imagined pinko associations (best
guess was that it was because he had traveled to the USSR to research _Sibir_).
Such a blacklisting would really hurt me in my current job.  I made about 15
business trips to the US (from Canada) last year.
That makes no sense.  "Country Y would pass a law saying that country X may
bar you for something country X doesn't like"??  That's unnecessary on two
counts: Country Y has no jurisdiction in X, and X doesn't need Y permission
anyway.  Example, so called "sex tourist" from western countries travel to
the far east to have sex with minors.  You can't do it back home, but there
nothing to stop you from doing it abroad.  Or if you want an example closer
to home, how about Californians traveling to Nevada to gamble?
