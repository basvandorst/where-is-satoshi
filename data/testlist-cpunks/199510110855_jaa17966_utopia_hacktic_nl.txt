Two years ago, I pointed out that getting a single message past
the man in the middle isn't good enough; you have to convince your
readers that the key they received on one channel is more accurate
than the key they're receiving on all the other channels.
But if they'll believe that, they may also believe the man in the middle's
announcement that the key in your name on all the keyservers is
wrong, and the correct key is the one he's putting out.
Can't win either way, but it's still important to get the key out.
My current key is 0x54696D4D; the fingerprint is 4D 65 44 75 53 61 21 2F   41 73 55 64 85 6D 21 7F.
