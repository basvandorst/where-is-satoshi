Help with encryption needed
        Can someone point me towards a set of C functions along the lines of:
char *encrypt (cleartext_string, key);
char *decrypt (encrypted_string, key);
Where encrypt would return the encrypted string and decrypt would return the
decrypted string.  The stronger the encryption the better.  Thanks.

It should be a secret key algorithm, and be able to hanlde blocks of at least 256 characters in length.  Keysize isn't as important as the type of encryption
being used.  Something that is reasonably secure such as IDEA or DES is preferable to a function that just XORs everything.  I'm sure if I was a more patient person I could download a few megs of source from the net and pore through it to find what I'm looking for.  I was hoping that someone on this list could be of assistance and save me the trouble.
