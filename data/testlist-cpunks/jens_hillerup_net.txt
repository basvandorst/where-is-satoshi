There's a good one made by Swedish hacktivists called fripost.org. They
won't bow down unless they are forced by Swedish judges, for what it's
worth. I believe they also provide an English version of their website.
Heh, neat hack.

Absolutely! There's a mirror of the now-404'd doc here: According to Twitter it's 404'd because there's a new version around:
Haven't looked into that, though. It may or may not be the same document.

If you're paranoid about lower-level backdoors you could have a look at the
open-source BIOS implementation CoreBoot(.org) which has support for the
X60 series. A plus is that you get super-fast boot times! Here's Peter
Stuge explaining some stuff about the project much better than I'm able to:

Whoa. Me too!
BTW, Nicolai Sennels is a racist nutcase. He's had a long career of nobody
taking him seriously in Denmark, resorting to having his hate speech
distributed by a publisher mostly known for its far-right affiliations:
 Just because
he has a degree in psychology doesn't mean his "scientific" writings should
be taken seriously if they aren't published in a peer-reviewed journal.* *
Also, wasn't this list supposed to be about cypherpunk?

Nice information, thanks. Would it be wrong to assume larger data
rates to be attainable on an FM "link" than over the telephone line?
For music etc. FM has far superior sound quality in any case.
Yes, I thought of that too in September. Luckily I've taken courses in
abstract algebra and error-correcting codes at my university; I think
I'd be able to write a working RS implementation from my theory books.
Another thing I didn't tell in my first mail is that I've been wanting
to design a protocol for metadata, too, since it doesn't really make
sense to decode and save half files anyway. It would also make it
possible to send the file names and file sizes beforehand so the
receiver can know how much of the file s/he has already received.
And yes, I want this to be truly one-way -- no acks. The idea is that
I want the receiving end to need as little hardware as possible: one
FM radio and one computer with a sound card (and this software). The
sender obviously has access to an FM transmitter (or whatever becomes
the sound carrier). This modulation algorithm should not provide
authenticity of the sender, instead cryptographic signing of the data
should happen at higher levels of the stack.
Thanks a lot! I'll have a look at it soon.

Isn't RTLSDR only for *reading* signals?
