@_subject: wall street journal television piece 
wall street journal television is looking for someone who can talk to
them (anonymously if necessary) about computer system security,
specifically, breaking in.  ideally they are looking for someone who
can appear on camera in NYC (again, anonymously if necessary) for a
taping in the next day or two.
this is apparently in response to a recent New York Times article
about a christmas day break in.  the person doing the piece has an
email address which i'll pass on to anyone who wants to talk with her.
she has indicated that she is interested in getting the big picture,
though anything is possible with the press, she sounds like she is
hoping to desensationalize / make more realistic some of the
inaccurate info in the NYT.
please contact me if you are interested, and i'll forward email on to
her so she can get back to you.  feel free to use any of the anonymous
email remailer services if that is appropriate.
i'm not on this list, apologies if this is inappropriate, and please
cc me on any relevant communication.  yowsa.
