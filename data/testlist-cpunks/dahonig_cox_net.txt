@_subject: Did you *really* zeroize that key?  
Wouldn't a crypto coder be using paranoid-programming skills, like *checking* that the memory is actually zeroed? (Ie, read it back..)  I suppose that caching could still
deceive you though?
I've read about some Olde Time programmers
who, given flaky hardware (or maybe software), would do this in non-crypto but very important apps.

Two points.  First, Joe Sixpack won't use it if it requires
an extra click; but he might if the mail queueing is in
the background.
Second, spammers use trojans that establish local mail relays (!)
You think they won't steal some cycles to pollute? Ok, three points.  If you're sending from your PDA, either deal with the battery-life-loss as a cost of emailing from your PDA, or have your net-connected host
do the work.  Again, transparently, or no one will use it.
Personally, I favor an Assasination Politics flavor solution,
but that's unlikely to gain widespread favor :-)

@_subject: "Scan design called portal for hackers" 
EETimes 25 Oct 04 has an article about how the testing structures on ICs makes them vulnerable to attacks.  The basic idea is
that to test a chip, you need to see inside
it; this can also reveal crypto details (e.g., keys) which compromise the chip.  This has been known to us with an interest
in both crypto and IC design for some time,
but its nice to see it exposed in the public
lit.  There are methods that avoid this,
such as BIST, but they are less popular.

@_subject: Intel to also add RNG 
Obviously there are costs associated with a HW RNG as someone enumerated.  Since Intel
can no doubt shut it off when not used, it is free.  And die authors
are always looking for more content to add.  (And obviously to this
list, without crypto tools the net is worse than useless, its deceptively
reliable :-)  So crypto hw will continue to be increasingly useful.)
Since the crypto cluefull would never use a single raw RNG of any kind,
and would even seek to use multiple diverse conditioning algorithms, cpu bandwidth allowing, a "hw" source can only help.
(Unless they were implementing something useless like DRM)
Except as someone wrote, if its the devil's hwrng, or can be clandestinely
switched into that mode as useful.

References: <20110106011631.A19080 Frankly ridiculuous, JA must realize that only ideological motivations are
robust enough for his purposes.  Actually, religion would be sufficient
motivation as well, but all the clueful are atheists.
One must have a day job, semiretired architect, say, so that one can pursue
one's own noble ideals.  Mozart had to tutor and perform and otherwise sell
his time so he could do what he wanted.  I won't speculate on JA's personal
finances but intelligent people capable of controlling their environment
are always valuable.
I'll mention Gilmore and May as examples of selfish-atruistic-techsaints.
Young and Assange will be discussed this way, one day. On the Daniel <---> JA axis of access-to-leaks I look forward to those more
brazen than JA who don't bother with protecting (US) Collaborators and
other collateral damage.  Daniel, by offering material only to MSM, is a
distraction.  If MSM were adequate there would be no niche for cryptome, WL, or Daniel's
honeypot.  WL's current trickle is a disgrace.  Open the pod bay doors, Hal.

A long time ago I bought a geiger counter for crypto exploration.  Problem is, you can't buy rad sources strong enough to generate enough entropy (which is *still* subject to conditioning of course, despite the hype, and any way a GM tube will saturate..).  Even if you take your smoke detector apart and use an alpha-windowed tube.
But a detuned FM radio card seemed to do quite well.  Admittedly, no white vans driving my amps.  Are these sources not supported as entropy sources?   (Pardon my linux randomness being out of date)
Also, why u no trust Intel's RNG? :-)

A number of public reviews of DPR's infosec mistakes have been published.
I think a strong solution to the 'tackled in library' defects would be to have:
1) program to notice his magic bracelet is not near
2) program to notice that vid cam is not a head but a chaotic scene
 is particularly easy without extra hardware (ca. 2015)  You'll have to switch it off when you
visit the loo.
And of course, things like 'back to wall facing forward' would have been helpful.
