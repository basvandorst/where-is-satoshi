@_subject: Feds reading this list, Jim Bell, and threats 
Horseshit. Anybody here ever hear of the Boston Tea Party? How
about the American Revolution?  War of Independece? French Revolution?
  You know, people who said "Fuck this shit, I've had enough." People
who acted in concert to fight injustice and oppression.
  Perhaps Phill and Tim might want to take afternoon tea together
and watch the tanks roll by, since Hitler only wants Austria...
  I haven't noticed anyone on the list suggesting that they are
going to wait to buy a gun until they hear a burglar/murderer
coming through the window.
  If we are going to castigate someone for suggesting ways to take
action against oppressive taxation, then perhaps we should call
the Queen of England, tell her we're sorry for our forefather's
error in judgement, and that we'll start flying the Union Jack
  Excuse me? Only people whose views you personally approve of
should be presented as a representative of cypherpunk views?
  I hate to burst your bubble, Phill, but everyone on the list
is a representative of cypherpunk views and people outside the
have a right to pick and choose the various viewpoints as they
see fit.
  So did Hitler and Mussolini.
  Then why bring it up? To cast vague aspersions?
  So you're calling Tim a blowhard who likes to play at anarchy
but lacks the balls to propose anything concrete? *
{* DisinfoTranslation Technique (c) Greg Broiles}
  Your own propensity for murderous thoughts in no way reflects on
other individual's interpretations of Jim Bell's intentions.
  Certainly Jim Bell tended to answer questions such as, "What day
is it?" with a speech on AP, but what do hashcash programmers
discuss? Hashcash. What does anyone talk about? The things they
have an active interest in? So what's your point?
  It seems quite likely that Hallam-Baker is inventing facts which
don't exist because he is being paid to do so in order to do a
character assassination on Jim Bell.
  Anyone else want to jump in with off-the-wall claims about what
is "likely" and what is not?
  It seems to me that many list members have their heads further
up their ass than the Feds, since they don't even view Bell's threats serious enough to even arrest him. They are on a simple
fishing expedition to try to find a cause to harrass him into
shutting the fuck up.
  A *true fact* (rather than vague bullshit about what is "likely")
is that John Perry's remailer *was* used to send direct threats
to a government official.
  So, Tim and Phill, which one of you wants to step up to the plate
and be the first one to attempt to ostracize him so that his views
about the need for anonymous communications will not be taken as representative of the cypherpunks views?
  Or is Perry's implementation of a system that can be abused to
be allowed while Bell's theoretical design of a system to fight
oppression is not to be allowed?
  Does the government wait until the enemies missles are launched
to start preparing plans for defence and counter-attack?
  It is outright riduclous to suggest that individuals and groups
should act otherwise, and contrary to their own self-interest.
  Government and corporate entities are regularly castigated on
the cypherpunks list as thugs who must be dealt with in one manner
or another. Various levels of action are suggested in relation to
the severity of the infringement on our interests.    Jim Bell's pet project was to work on a solution for problems
which reached the point of requiring the ultimate action--total
removal of the threat. Each cypherpunk had his or her own views
of what constituted a problem of that magnitude.   To suggest that any cypherpunk should not be allowed to express his or her opinion in regard to who his solution might apply to, and why, is not much different than saying that none of our discussions should address specific issues, only generalities.
  This is akin to saying that we cannot mention older people,
or sick people, when discussing euthanasia.
  Excuse me, but someone is shooting at me.
  I need to go buy a gun...

What are you going to testify to?
  To Bell's scheme not being a threat to anybody because it would
never work?  That it is nothing more than a theoretical exercise
which does not present a danger to a single soul? That it is preposterous of the government to prosecute someone on the basis
of a pie-in-the-sky, preposterous idea?
  I'm certain the government is anxiously awaiting your testimony,
as well as that of a number of others on the list who seem to think
that Jim Bell is such a powerful and evil force that his mere thoughts and speculations are an overwhelming threat to civilization
as we know it.
  Everyone who thinks they can implement Jim Bell's AP system
in the near future, raise both hands.
  Now bend over backwards, placing your head near your rectum.
  Now...

Amazing that they notified you right after I made note
of it, isn't it?
  I think that they are confusing you with Hallam-Baker, who
offered to testify against Bell in court.
  This is an understandable error, since even a modicum of
traffic analysis shows that you work in concert with one

So, according to the Air Force, an armed warplane was
allowed to approach within a few miles of one of the
most important underground military installations in
the country, without anybody noticing.
  Are bears Catholic? Does the Pope shit in the woods?
Are cypherpunks revisionists handling the current
military disinformation campaign on this event?
  An armed warplane capable of delivering its payload
upon unwary U.S. citizens gives every indication of
making an attempt to do so, and no major media even
broach the possibility of this being the case.
  I think perhaps I'll drop my cable news channels and
subscribe to the 24-hour a day "Happy Days" network.
  If I'm going to live in fantasy land, I'd rather watch the Fonz raise his eyebrows when mentioning the
Bobsie twins, without once suggesting that he would
like to bang the living shit out of them.

Mein Fuhrer,
  I am happy to see that the wall around East Berlin was
torn down to prepare for the new ElectroMagnetic Curtain
that is currently being built around the whole of Germany.
  Surely the age is past when we can expect to hold power
over our citizens by enslaving their mere bodies. WE MUST
CONTROLTHEIR MINDS!
  Please be advised that the enemies of the CyberReich are
already plotting to undermine the ElectroMagnetic Curtain.
  Herr Gilmore calls our efforts at maintaining ElectroMagnetic
purity as "damage" which others on the InterNet must "route
around." Herr May seems to be questioning our right to crush
all electromagnetic emanations which are generated from ethnically inferior electromagnetic sources. Herr Hughes is
is producing StegoDolls with paper and plastic scissors, in
an obvious attempt to subconsciously corrupt the minds of
Aryan children. (These StegoDolls have suspiciously large
breasts, leading me to believe that they are meant to undermine the morals of adults, as well.)
  There are attempts being made to put mirrors in place to
begin the formation of an organization known as InterNet Free Europe, in an attempt to allow our citizens' minds
to immigrate beyond the walls of the ElectroMagnetic Curtain.
  However, our Western Allies are even now taking steps to
seize control over the InterNet Domain registration system,
placing it in the capable hands of the FCC. With these efforts
and the ones being made to route technological development into
increasingly narrow channels, we should be able to keep control of bandwidth in the hands of those with interests
similar to our own.
  There should be no reason that we cannot control the citizens
by a combination of 'shortages' of bandwidth, strict laws limiting
the use of bandwidth to 'pure' purposes, and regulations which
allow us to control the nature of encryption programs so that
we can ferret out those who attempt to "route around" our control
  We must also take steps to limit our citizen's access to the
dangerous materials contained in "The True Story of the InterNet."

@_subject: commercial web remailer myemail.net 
is a commercial remailer service;
you can get an account for $5/month for some services,
and use their web form free to send email and post news.
Some parts of it are still under construction.
Email has a nice attention-getting footer that gets put on each message
to indicate that it's anonymous mail (so if you want to chain
through other remailers, you'll need cutmarks), which says there's
no sender identity logging.  On the other hand, there's an interesting
pixel in the web form that you use to send the email:
Blocking is available both for email addresses and newsgroups.
For email, just fill in your address in a form; it's not verified
(my attempted mail to testme at bogus.com was rejected).
The blocking works immediately, and since you submit email via a web form, reject messages get presented directly rather than
being emailed to the bit bucket at some remailer.
For news, the policy is that newsgroups will be blocked if there are
requests from 12 different people (as distinguished somehow from
12 different requests by the same person forging headers.)
Encryption: If you connect to  the button
for anonymous email will fetch the form using https: ; if not, then not.
So you'll have to remember to use it correctly.  It's 128-bit RC4,
which may affect some non-US users who haven't gotten SafePassage yet.
It's a good start.
