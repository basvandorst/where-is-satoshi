UPDATE: Further research shows that the Express didnt quite have all
its facts straight. This scheme is active, and the numbers are fairly
accurate (if estimated), but the mentions of actual cameras in
peoples homes are exaggerated. The truth is that the scheme can take
the most troublesome families out of their homes and move them,
temporarily, to a neutral, government-run compound. Here they will be
under 24-hour supervision. CCTV cameras are not specifically
mentioned, not are they denied, but 24-hour supervision certainly
doesnt rule this out from the camera-loving Brits.

I established  on Freenode for essentially the same purpose, and
there's virtually always active conversation going on.

I'll check out this new channel, too, of course.
