a stronghold in the capital and in the hearts of American
culture, demonstrating their interest in power, rather
than in the Truth.
  Truth is the enemy of those who hunger for power.
  Truth must be pursued vigorously, honestly, and
  Truth is what we offer in the pages of the Conservative

testimonials from just a few of the thousands of readers
of the Conservative Chronicle, as well as from some of our
 Please allow me to add my thanks, along with millions
of other conservatives, for the fine job you people do
in bringing us the thoughts and feelings of so many fine
columnists. I don't know how you do it. We can't get this
side of the news through our local papers or, for that
matter, the television media. Keep up the fine work. I
couldn't get through the week without you.
  -- Wow. I wish everyone I know could subscribe to this
  -- Wish to thank you for your publication, and the
great writers. It is nice not to have to rely on the TV
media for their views.
  -- The first thing I do when I get my copy of the
Conservative Chronicle is to look at a choice selection
of political cartoons. It's truly a laugh-and-learn
experience. Then I settle down to read political cartoons
from the most brilliant conservative writers in America.
The Conservative Chronicle is more than a publication; it
is a revered institution, whose pages are reserved for the
most talented, conservative columnists and cartoonists in
America. That's why I frequently send gift subscriptions
to special friends and fans. (Linda Bowles)
  -- It's rare to find columnists who haven't fallen into
the immoral trap of situational ethics. the good think
about the Conservative Chronicle is that it provides badly
needed moral leadership all in one place. (Walter E.
  -- It amazes me how many people stop me on the street
to say they read my column in the Conservative Chronicle.
People really devour this publication, and for good reason:
it tells you everything you need to know about the
conservative perspective on current events, and more. (L.
