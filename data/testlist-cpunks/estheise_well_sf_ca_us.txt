Jacking In: A Series on Cyberspace Literacy presents
ONLINE COMMUNITIES AROUND THE BAY: THE INNS AND THEIR KEEPERS
Every computer-based conferencing system lets its subscribers access relevant community information and discuss topics ranging from Apple Computers to zymurgy.  While these systems are all based on the same conceptual model, each one evolves its own personality and community standards based on underlying software, management policies, and, ultimately, the subscribers it attracts.
This installment of Jacking In will feature a talk about building and nourishment of online community, followed by community-conscious demonstrations of several San Francisco-based conferencing systems.
In cyberspace, community is not geography.
