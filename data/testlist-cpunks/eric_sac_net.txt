@_subject: Traffic analysis by FBI against Earth First 
Remember the phrase "social networks analysis".  The FBI seems to use it as
a term of art.
I'm right now listening to Judy Bari on the pirate radio station in Berkeley
(104.1 FM).  She's being interviewed over the telephone and talking about
her court case against the FBI relating to the coverup of the bombing that
she's being charged for.  (It was under her own car seat, for those of you
who know nothing about this.)
In any case, there have been depositions and discoveries in this case, and
one of the revelations was that there was a document the FBI seized (under
circumstances I'm not familiar with) with which they wanted to perform a
social networks analysis upon.  It was the interviewer's phone and addess book.

As for me, I stopped having time to read cypherpunks a year and a half ago.
Tim had nothing to do with it.  The cypherpunks list has changed and I have
changed; so be it.

@_subject: Proposed Addendum to International Standards 
I was, for some reason, browsing ISO two letter country codes today and
came upon such oddities as
EM	Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (Trademarks and Designs)
So I decided we needed some new ones, since it wasn't just for countries
CB	Cyberspace
CP	Cypherspace
Cyberspace, the domain of electronic communication.  Cypherspace, the
domain of encrypted and untraceable electronic communication.
Do you think we can get ISO to approve it?
Better yet, do you think we could get some of those oval stickers like you
see on European cars?  I'm sure Ian will want some little ones for his Pilot.
And now all we need is an ISO 639 natural language identifier for
ciphertext.  How about "xx"?

@_subject: Trademarking CypherSpace??? 
All this fuss is really not such a big deal, as long as the Patent and
Trademark Office  hears about it.  I know nothing
about trademark procedure, but I imagine that a letter (or three) to the
PTO referencing the right application number on it could scotch an
application but quick.  Printing out email and adding a stamp seems almost
Maybe the nice folks at i-planet (I know you're getting this) could just
post their application number and save us the trouble of finding it ourselves?
And I checked:  The fee for a formal _ex parte_ appeal filing is only $100.
 I'm sure the i-planet lawyers will spend far more than that defending one
of those.
