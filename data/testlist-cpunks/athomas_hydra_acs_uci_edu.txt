@_subject: Two basic questions... 
First:  Is there an FTP site with the excellent cypherpunk article from Whole Earth
Review online?  If there isn't, would someone be willing to email me a I couldn't find a clear answer from the pgp docs, is there any reason to
upgrade your public key with newer versions of pgp?  I generated my
keys with 2.2 and am now using 2.3a, does this matter at all? I'm sorry if these questions have been addressed recently, I'm a little out of touch (I've got 700+ unread cypherpunks messages in my folder 8(

@_subject: Liability wrt making pgp available to the campus 
About six months ago I was going to to compile and install pgp in the
campus software library which is made available to hundreds of systems
distributed accross the campus.  I decided against it at the time
becuase I was unsure if anyone (namely the University) would be liable
for providing the pgp executable to the public without having a
liscence for the RSA algorithm.  I had pretty much abandoned the idea
until I saw this post.  If i'm correct, it's the resposibility of the
user to obtain a liscence which is why pgp is freely available at ftp
sites without putting the owner of the site at risk.  In this case
would the University be resposible for aquiring a liscence?  This also
brings up another question: is there anyone out there using freeware
pgp who has obtained a RSA licsence so they can use it legally?  Also
I'm curious if there are there any sysadmins out there that have made
pgp available to their users?
