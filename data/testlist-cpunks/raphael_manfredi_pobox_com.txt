Quoting "Vijay K. Gurbani"  from ml.p2p.hackers:
:This looks like Pirate Pay is injecting multiple sybils into the
:DHT with node-IDs close to the info-hash of the file, thus making
:the sybils responsible for the file.  This assures that all queries
:are sent to the sybils, allowing the sybils to sent out false
:information to the other peers.
This is a protection that can be added to every DHT nodes and which will
significantly increase the cost of widespread Sybil attacks.
This DHT protection algorithm has been implemented in gtk-gnutella, with
a few enhancements of mine (transmitted back to the author of the above
Here's my summary of the article, as C comments within gtk-gnutella:
