I've been trying to get True Names by Vernor Vinge, and have been told it's
out of print (like most good cypunk ), does anybody have it scanned? I realize this is without permission, so does anybody have Vinge's address?
(e-mail or otherwise) or could anybody ask him? Btw, does he have any other
crypto/anonymity related stories? Thanks in advance.

@_subject: Vinge's True Email name ? 
I can see your point, but since it's been asked (and you're all responsible people and he knows about killfiles) This is the address I just
found in the cyberpunk faq : vinge at aztec.sdsu.edu
And btw, thanks for all the replies to my True Names question. I did end
end up finding it (on loan), but somehow this city's used bookstores seem to have every one of his books but True Names. Sigh...
Back to crypto though, would anybody know about any more recent works on
the NSA than Puzzle Palace (other than the Wired articles or the NSA handbook that was posted to the net)? For that matter, has anybody heard of a recently published book on the Canadian Security Establishment (it
came out just two months ago I think, I just can't remember the author or title) or anything else on that agency? Mucho Thank you.

@_subject: Why use plastic for remailers and DH? 
This point may have been raised before, but anyway, unless you're using a swiss-bank issued credit card for a numbered account (if that's at all possible), or a bogus name on the card, why would anybody want to use something as completely traceable as a credit card to pay for a remailer or a data haven?

The book "Temporary Autonomous Zone" is available online at wiretap.spies.com
The most recent issue of Mondo 2000 talks about the CD with Hakim Bey and
the producer.
I also saw another e-book site that had some more of his stuff, can't remember what it was though.
Of course, one could always just buy them on paper (remember that?)

Sorry about that.
The hazards of being brief, I guess (never post when you're half asleep). Gopher and ftp work for the same address on this one.  gopher. The pointers to the other etext sites might lead you to his other
stuff (there were two others as far as I can remember).
