I really doubt that they would make it lock up the machine.  If that
were true, I could just walk up to the copier, slap down a $1 bill, hit
the button and walk away.  Poof -
I've just created weeks of downtime and a hefty repair bill.  Gee sounds
like fun.  Now, how many businesses do you know of that would be willing
to take that kind of risk in buying a copier?
