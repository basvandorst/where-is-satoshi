I agree this is the general direction, but I think there are some
major exceptions; for example, the doctrine of prior restraint was not
established in court until 1931.

This article does not say that he was charged with "possibly thinking
about possibly making ricin".  It says he was charged with actually
producing hundreds of lethal doses of it.

I don't know if they are standardized nationally or internationally.
In some areas traffic signals change at night to blinking-red for the
cross street and blinking-yellow for the main road; this is intended
to be similar to a two-way stop.

Routers do not have any ability to take input from a frequency
standard, even if you have one available.  Each interface recovers
clocking from the line, or can use an internal clock.  Some discussion
of this as it applies to routers running PPP over SONET over dark fiber:
Those routers will operate independently of any external clock.
Routers that are connected to a mux (which includes anything DS3 and
below) will recover clock from the mux, which will have its own timing
interface or internal clock.
I'm not a SONET guru, but my understanding is that even with the
internal clocks, you would see at worst an occasional error burst for
a few ms.  No credible engineer would make a network that fell over
without GPS anyway, since it's just too easy for someone to
accidentally knock over your antenna while installing another, or nick
the cable with a saw, or who knows what.  In a nutshell, this isn't
something I'd worry about.

Only because Joe Burglar doesn't yet have the tools to crack the weak
encryption on this device.  Joe Burglar now has tools to break the
"password protection" on word processor and other files, and if this
new device becomes at all popular, then tools to crack it will become
readily available.  It's only a matter of time.

Yes, it is.  Despite the disk manufacturers' intentionally misleading
spec sheets, most hard disks are not very much faster than 30 MB/s.
For example, the new Barracuda V transfers between 23 and 44 MB/s,
depending on where on the disk you read from.
Even if the disk were infinitely fast, the Firewire interface is
limited to 50 MB/s.
I think this product would be extremely useful, if it is trustable.

Most of the security features of a dollar bill are not directed
toward the serial number; they are designed to prevent changing the
denomination, or to increase the cost of creating a real-looking bill
from scratch.  Changing the serial number is likely to be fairly
For this to be secure, you would have to keep the serial number a
secret; and in that case, the paper could be any piece of paper with
a secret written on it.

For perspective, however, current-model Palms have 33 MHz Motorola 68k
processors, which used to be considered a nice desktop CPU.  In 1991,
when PGP was first released, the Mac Classic II had a 16 MHz 68030 and
2 MB of RAM.  If that was enough for PGP, then a Palm m500 ought to be
capable of it also.
Granted, you will want to use longer keys now.  But the hardware in
your pocket can do more crypto than you might think.  And they're only
getting faster.

Please read the paper.  What's sent is not a picture of the token, but
a hash of a picture of the pattern produced by a laser shining through
the token.  Because the laser scatters through the token in three
dimensions it is difficult to model or reproduce the token.  By
varying the angle of the laser you can produce a large number of
possible patterns, too many to be stored -- it's claimed this can be
as much as 7 TB of data.  So you can have a useful level of security
even with untrusted token readers, and an extremely high level of
security with trusted token readers.
