[Please reply via netmail or Cc: - I have only periodic access to list.]
Is the Mixmaster user software for DOS platforms completed yet?
Thanks for any help.

@_subject: Need Mail-to-News gates 
Could someone PLEASE netmail me some _known reliable_ gates that use the
straight netmail address format (alt.whatnot at bosco.kollege.edu)?
All of the old reliables are shut down and none of the ones listed in
the last remailer helpfile I got work either:
group.name at news.demon.co.uk
group.name at dispatch.demon.co.uk
group.name at bull.com
group.name at cass.ma02.bull.com
group.name at paris.ics.uci.edu
group.name at crs4gw.crs4.it
group.name at berlioz.crs4.it
group.name.usenet at canaima.Berkeley.EDU
NONE of these work, or were nonfunctional when I tested them, anyway.
I use the other gates like mail2news at utopia.hacktic.nl with the
Newsgroups: field format, but the straight address format is useful for
some other purposes.
