@_subject: Privacy and mail-lists 
This might be a step away from 'cypher' topics, but, Duncan, I was
curious as to wether you publish any manuals on privacy, and/or can
suggest books or sources for privacy and financial privacy info. Ideally
of a hard-headed type, not the "If we could only start an offshore
digital Free Bank" genre.
Back to 'cypher' topics; I've not seen anything mentioned here about
anonymous and secure mail-lists-- probably I missed the discussion. Can
anyone suggest any files in soda.berkeley.edu or other archives that
tackle this topic?
Later, Bill
