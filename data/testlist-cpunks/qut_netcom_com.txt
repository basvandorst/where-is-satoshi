@_subject: License Plates 
One method of protest against License Plate invasion of privacy is to simply not use license plates.  When I bought my car six years ago the front license plate was never drilled for license plate holes, so I simply took off the rear plate too, and in six months I only got two tickets for it, one for twenty dollars in Walnut Creek which I only had to pay, not needing to "fix the defect," and another on the Richmond Bridge, costing seventy six dollars because it was a fix it ticket which I didn't want to fix, and pulled over another time with only a warning.  Not bad at all for California, has any one else practised this form of protest?  I had to put the rear plate back on though, because I acquired a drinking problem and I didn't want to get busted for drunk driving.
Now that I'm sober, and with worse threats concerning license plates, it's time to pull off that rear plate again!  Doing it tonight, join me!

@_subject: Racists Speak Up For Crypto 
Good Morning from the Zundelsite:
I have a sweet friend in Santa Barbara, California who grew up with me in
the rain forests of South America.  Elvira and I share many things,
including an "encryption language" of sorts.  We used it with relish as
teenagers when the Mennonite Elders were spying on us, trying to ferret out
The key was really very simple, but our "government" just never  managed to
catch on.  It used to drive them wild.  Yet it was so ridiculously simple -
". . . repeat a vowel with a 'b'".
Prebesibidebent Clibintobon?
Just practice it a bit - no one will understands it!  It is hilarious.  It
gave us a tremendous edge on wickedness - mostly romantic wickedness but
now and then legitimate revolt against authority peddling a dogma we didn't
always like.
This story often comes to mind as I peruse the arguments regarding
censorship, particularly as I was reading a recent Phyllis Schlafly's essay
on "Clinton Is Trying to be Big Brother":
". . . We hope the appropriate government agencies will soon solve the
recent terrorist crimes and punish the criminals. But all Americans who
care about civil liberties should vigorously resist President Clinton's
attempt to use the terrorist attacks as an excuse to carry on his all-out
war against the personal privacy of law-abiding Americans.
Now the Clinton Administration is trying to make it illegal for individual
Americans to have private conversations with one another. That's the real
meaning of its effort to control encryption technology, and it's a direct
assault on the First Amendment.
It would be downright ridiculous to assert that the First Amendment
guarantees our right to speak in public but not in private. It would be
just as ridiculous to say that we have freedom to speak in words that the
government can understand, but not in words the government can't decipher.
Americans have the right to speak to one another in private, behind closed
doors, and we should likewise have the right to speak to one another in
code and to put our coded messages on computer in a process called
encryption. Americans would not tolerate the government opening and reading
the letters we send through the mails, and we should not tolerate the
government opening and reading our encrypted, or coded, messages sent via
Yet, Attorney General Janet Reno, FBI Director Louis Freeh, and Vice
President Al Gore are all demanding the authority to read our encrypted
messages. In a speech to the Commonwealth Club of California, Reno bluntly
stated her demand for "ensuring law enforcement access to encrypted data.''
Reno boasted that there is "a consensus'' that the government should create
a system known as "Key Escrow'' (i.e., a supposedly "neutral third
party''), to which all Americans should be forced to "entrust'' the keys to
their encrypted messages, and to which the government would have access. On
the contrary, there is no such consensus.
Do you trust Janet Reno with access to your private messages? Do you trust
the FBI to keep your files confidential?
On July 12, Al Gore announced that the Administration will continue to push
for the adoption of a massive public key infrastructure to give the
government access to all encrypted communications. In a blatant bid for a
police-state surveillance society, Gore warned about "the dangers of
unregulated encryption technology."
A neutral panel of the National Research Council was set up to make policy
recommendations about encryption. The panel called on the government to
abandon its efforts to restrict encryption.
The NSC panel concluded that increased use of encryption would enhance our
national security, not diminish it. Thirteen out of its 16 members had
security clearances with access to secret information, and they saw no
national security reason to justify the Clinton policy.
The Clinton Administration bases its campaign to control private encryption
on the alleged need to fight crime through wiretapping. However, the NSC
panel concluded that the ability of the private sector to transfer
confidential financial and other data over the information highway without
interception is far more important.
Encryption is a First Amendment issue, not a crime issue. If the Clinton
Administration is allowed to control encryption, it would be the biggest
expansion of federal power since the passage of the Income Tax Amendment in
1913 . . ."
And come to think of it, still after all these years: the Elders had no
business whatsoever spying on some teenagers.  They made the laws, and they
enforced the laws, and it was pretty much authoritarian business, but even
as young teenagers we knew that what they did was Trespass!
They had their reasons - but we had ours!  It was called privacy.

! !  Since version 2.1, PGP ("Pretty Good Privacy") has been rigged to ! allow the NSA to easily break encoded messages. Early in 1992, the author, ! Paul Zimmerman, was arrested by Government agents. He was told that he ! would be set up for trafficking narcotics unless he complied. The Government ! agency's demands were simple: He was to put a virtually undetectable ! trapdoor, designed by the NSA, into all future releases of PGP, and to
! tell no-one.
! !  After reading this, you may think of using an earlier version of ! PGP. However, any version found on an FTP site or bulletin board has been ! doctored. Only use copies acquired before 1992, and do NOT use a recent ! compiler to compile them. Virtually ALL popular compilers have been ! modified to insert the trapdoor (consisting of a few trivial changes) into ! any version of PGP prior to 2.1. Members of the boards of Novell, Microsoft, !

The only true part in this hoax is the extent of corporate and political membership in international capitalist organizations like the Council of Foreign Relations, Trilateral Commission, Bilderbergers, and hundreds of other redundent alike organizations dedicated to making the whole world the same.

@_subject: Anti-Racist Laws Stifle Political Liberty 
The mere lack of enforcement of an unjust law does not justify the continued extancy of that law.  That very "dead letter" law can be fired up at any time to harass critics of the university's anti-racist Some examples of dangerous dead letter laws:
* Abortion
Most people presume that abortion is legal in the USA, wrong.  Most states make abortion very illegal, our whole abortion freedom as currently exists rests entirely on a few federal court decisions.  If the previous Supreme Court decisions are overturned, most states will suddenly start enforcing their fascist anti-abortion laws.
* Hate Crime
Denmark used to be presumed by racists to be the only country in Europe where racism was legal.  Denmark's anti-racist laws were not enforced in ages.  Yet, the anti-racist laws sprung into action to persecute Gerhard Lauck, an American Nazi who desired to move to Denmark on the account of a provocateur that his organization would not be harrassed in Denmark.
Mr. Lauck was deported to Germany where he was sentenced to four years in prison to the outrage of professional anti-racists of the "moderation" of his punishment for merely speaking in pro-Nazi terms in Germany, where politics that challenge the ruling order is strictly illegal.
* Racism In Other Countries
Racist politics are explicitly illegal in every "white country" in the world except, so far, the USA.  The mere lack of enforcement in many of the countries such as South Africa, Canada, Denmark, Russian Federation, Malaysia, Australia, etc., does not exonerate that country from the charge of censorship as political intrigue.
* "We Will Take Power"
A lot of fake anti-censorship activists insist they are for free speech in the sense of allowing such political purposes as "we don't like your policies and we want you to change," but desiring to make illegal such political goals as "we don't like your power and we're going to try to take it away from you."  Yet there is no purpose, no purpose whatsoever in political speech, if there is no threat allowed to the ruling order expressed in idealogical terms and organizational forms.  Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Paine and all the nationalist founders of the American nation would approve of radicals organizing and expressing their goals of seizing power legally, or if denied the means of a republic for succession, illegally. * Unfree Nations
Germany is an example of a nation that prohibits any type of Nazi political party.  Therefore, Germany is not a free country, not an honest republic, in fact, less free even than Wilhelmian Germany in allowing radical parties to challenge the power structure.
I marvel at the resilience of the white people.
Their best characteristic is their desire to learn.
No other people has such an obsession with the intellect.

Oh, every value can be escaped, there's no reason that the full 8bit range cannot be incorporated throughout every operating system.  It's just legacy junk which keeps us putting up restrictions in everything that we really don't want.  Ditto for network software.

Neither Rush Limbaugh or Pat Buchanan are populists.  Populists tend to
believe in strong government with strict regulation of business, an
actually progressive tax system, confiscation of businesses which break
the rules, government enterprise in competition with the private sector,
no secrecy in government of the type required in the private sector,
bias toward small businesses and sole proprietors, etc.
Letting business "do whatever they want", really doesn't qualify.
FWIU, Buchanan's only claim is opposition to "free trade"(forcing the US
to trade)
AFWIU, Jefferson didn't like slavery, and later freed his slaves,

Although your viewpoint is well expressed, I feel you've
overlooked the possibility of socialism to solve the high

Socialism, a truly progressive economic system, would have
an actual graduated income tax, to discourage useless
make-work by the rich.
There are so many other benefits to patriotic socialism, it
would take a book the size of Das Kapitol just to list them.
For instance:
Taxes on trade, will act as a tonic on the national economy.
The tax on trade, of course, prevents it; relieving the
national security apparatus of 90% of its reason for being.
The state itself as a unifying theme, rather than patho
meanderings like crime, anti-racism, and religion.

PLEASE TURN YOUR ATTENTION TO THE CONTINUING CRYPTO EMERGENCY
! where are there so few remailers? the reasons are pretty obvious.
! these problems have been transparently apparent from the very ! beginning.
! ! 1. there is no economic incentive.
! ! as soon as there is a good economic incentive to run remailers, you
! will see them proliferate. but currently they have no virtually
! no value to the creator. it's like building a house for other people
! to live in out of humanitarianism. note that with web pages, you

! typically buying yourself *negative* publicity by running a remailer.
! ! what is the current incentive to run remailers? answer: adulation
! by other cypherpunks. hmmm, not necessarily all that motivating
! to very many.
WORKS FOR MEEEE
! 2. there is no good way to deal with spams or other so-called "abuse"
NETNEWS SPAM IS CAUSED BY MODERATION GET RID OF MODERATION TO END SPAM ONCE AND FOR ALL
! I commend the remailer operators for starting a mailing list to
! deal with spam. but the solution remains essentially "stop
! spam by hand". spammers still have the ability to be a serious
! threat to the network. this has been a threat from the beginning
! and has never been resolved. note that "spam avoidance" is a
! very, very difficult problem that plagues far more than remailers,
! such as mailing lists and usenet. but it is particularly acute
! with remailers.
USENET SPAM SAVES DISK SPACE ADMINS LOVE IT
! 3. liability
! ! there is a lot of liability to the operator of a remailer, and
! again, this risk is totally unsupportable from their current
! returns (nil). Hal Finney recently suggested restricting posts
! from remailers to avoid copyright liability. this will limit
! the liability and risk but does not totally remove it.
THE BEST STUFF IS CUMMING FROM CRYPTO WANNA BEE ON INSIDE TRACK FOR CLEAR TEXT TEEN NUDES
! 4. no need for a network
! ! in fact there is not really a need for a remailer network on one
! level. there is only a need if the service is not available. why
! is there only one anon.penet.fi? well, because of the above reasons,
! and also by the fact that only one is sufficient to serve all of
! cyberspace, virtually. what I mean is that there is easily enough
! traffic to justify another anon.penet.fi type remailer, but it's
! not totally critical (i.e. to the point that someone puts their
! resources where their mouth is) as long as anon.penet.fi is running.
THERE IS EXTREME UNDERCAPACITY FOR CRYPTO AND ANONYMINITY
! 5. etc.
! ==
! ! if people want to know why remailers haven't proliferated  in
! the same way that other cyberspace infrastructure has in the
! past, such as news servers and web sites, you have to focus on
! the above issues. remailers are NOT like other cyberspace services.
! they are a tremendous burden to run, instead of being of high
! use to the maintainer (even though they don't generate cash)
! in the way a web page or usenet server is.
INCORPORATE AND SELL ADVERTISING SPACE IN THE SIG THE COOLEST PEOPLE GET ANONYMOUS MAIL POSTS THERE IS A VAST UNTAPPED SOURCE OF REVENUE GUNS DRUGS CRYPTO PYRO PORN PERSONALS ETC INFORMATION WANTS TO BE PAID FOR
! the main problem, getting cash for the service, is slowly dissolving
! to the point that it will not be an obstacle. I predict that ! remailers (and many other unusual services) may begin to proliferate
! at that point-- but not as much as other areas of cyberspace such
! as the web. remailers are always going to be plagued by the other
! problems I mentioned above unless some really brilliant genius
! comes along to solve what seems to be the unsolvable.
INCORPORATE AND SELL ADVERTISING SPACE IN THE SIG THE COOLEST PEOPLE GET ANONYMOUS MAIL POSTS THERE IS A VAST UNTAPPED SOURCE OF REVENUE GUNS DRUGS CRYPTO PYRO PORN PERSONALS ETC INFORMATION WANTS TO BE PAID FOR
! another tact the cypherpunks might take to get anonymity into ! the cyberspace infrastructure is to target forum architecture.
! instead of trying to create remailers that "feed into" other
! networks, why not build in remailers into those networks themselves?
! I am thinking of the way NNTP could be a massive anonymous ! remailer network, and that in fact it was once but that this
! was purposely designed against in the protocol (preventing people
! from anonymously submitting articles to NNTP hosts).
BUT IN THE MEAN TIME WE WANT MORE SERVERS
! I propose that as long as there are serious elements involved
! in building up cyberspace that are hostile to anonymity, you
! are not going to see it flourish in the way other services have.
! it seems to me the major obstacles to widespread anonymity
! are perceptual, not technological. if people can find a way

! to handle the above issues and still provide anonymity, it will
! spread. otherwise, I doubt it will ever become very "mainstream".
! perhaps the above problems are intrinsic to anonymity, which would
! be a pity in my view.
! ! BTW, TCM laments that he hasn't seen master's thesis on remailers.
! I consider Lance Cottrell's mixmaster work to be really on that
! level, and highly commendable. LC has really advanced remailer
! technology by tremendous leaps and bounds since putting his mind
! to it. also Levien's remailer page is another very outstanding
! service. it is possible that all the real research into remailers
! is being done at the NSA ! ! seriously, though, I think cpunks have an opportunity to do some
! introspection here. it seems a pretty good rule in cyberspace that
! "cool and useful services flourish and grow". witness Usenet
! and the web. why haven't the cpunks been able to tap into that
! kind of exponential force with remailers? the problems are not
! merely technological. I would say the technological problems
! associated with the remailers are the most straightforward to
! solve. its the complex social issues that are seemingly insurmountable.
! ! I really believe that if anyone wants to get more anonymity in
! cyberspace, they must deal head on with the sociological ! "anonymity taboo" in society. why is there a taboo in society
! against anonymity? could it be there are some good reasons for it?
! is it possible to create a "socially acceptable" anonymity? of
! course this line of thinking is going to be utterly repulsive
! to some on this list, but I contend it is essential to remailer
! growth strategy.
! ! of course if people don't want remailers to ever go "mainstream"
! anyway, well then there is no problem. the remailer network still

! ! In a survey conducted in Sweden a few years ago, 50% of Swedish

Hundreds of thousands of private American citizens legally own machine guns, silencers, live hand grenades, .75 caliber machine guns, etc.
Perhaps 40% or so of the populace lives in an area without significantly
higher regulations concerning such than the federal, which is not that bad.  There is no federal law making silenced machine guns substantially more difficult to purchase and shoot than ordinary handguns.  The feds certainly don't require training or any other similar requirement.  Contrary to popular fiction, ALL firearms have been permanently registered since the 1968 Gun Control Act.  The media monopoly lies when they say the contrary.
How many firearm crimes were committed by these hundreds of thousands of ordinary untrained destructive weapon owners with their destructive weapons in the entire span of 1980-1996?  *NONE*!  THEREFORE, everyone in Sweden and America should be allowed to own silenced machine guns without any greater than the usual restrictions.
BTW, I muse that the issue of guns, drugs and censorship make an excellent litmus test for libertarians: either you support the legalization of, all of, or your a fake.

I just mean to throw the media's lies right back at them.  If crypto
anonymity is considered to lend itself to crime, no doubt by the same

! I circumcized Andrew "Skippy" Mathis  with my own hand,
! as the Right Reverend Colin James III pronounced the blessings.
! ! Igor Chudov, our understudy, sucked out the blood.
No, you forget, Brother Schlomo, Rich Graves did the cutting and
Dr. Fuckhead did the sucking.  From the right hand to the left!
Your a little confused about when you circ'ed Dr. Fuckhead and he
ended up with gangreen, that was before Mr. Graves decided to use
anti-septics, I was the first with the new style rite.

@_subject: How To Do Cgi Against www.anonymizer.com 
There are two difficult ways to tell how to Cgi your page against
                 Either ask Rich Graves for the details on how he did it with
Use a decent browser client with 100% debugging mode, {and|or}
telnet:// {and|or}
and enter a telnet script to find out how he did it.
BTW, how to do telnet scripting and data transfers between two remote hosts with standard telnet clients available for Unice shells?  It's rediculous to have to sz to my local machine before sz to my remote account if I simply want to transfer a file between two remote hosts!  Yes, I'm aware of the mail utility, I mean telnet.

@_subject: Declaring The Ultimatum To Fascist Germany 
! (I also don't dislike Germans in general. I studied some German in high
! school--don't ask me to use it, though!--and have visited Germany. They
! just have a certain well-known tendency to take the authoritarian path at
! times.)
Yes.  How to get an anonymous Unix shell account in Germany, Singapore
and the UK?  Easy here, but is some *law* or custom in Germany to
force ISP customers to show to demand passports or Germany's national
ID card the citizens are forced to carry at all times under penalty
of jail for the failure to do so?
There's obvious reasons why I and Declan would like to get accounts
anonymously.  But I'd do it with my passport name if I am able to do
so.  Distributing censored information carries more of a political
statement if conducted by those with accounts that are located in the
unfree country itself.  If something like Gerhard Lauck is practical
proof, only those who intend to actually ever go to Europe or Asia
in the status quo need worry about actually getting incarcerated for
situationist anti-censorship activities.  Who cares, I don't,

! ...
! ! Though my German friends will perhaps feel I am picking on them, this is
! not so (this week Germany is in the hot seat, last week it was
! Singapore....).
! ! A Modest Proposal:
! ! * as Germany is bent on blocking sites which carry this subversive
! pamphlet, "Radikal," let us mirror it on thousands of sites around the
! world.
! ! * when the Germans went into Danmark and insisted Jews wear badges,
! ordinary citizens (and the Danish Royal Family, as I recall) also took to
! wearing these Star of David badges.
! ! * wouldn't it be deliciously ironic if the "Free Speech Blue Ribbon" now
! attached to so many pages were to be joined by a "Star of David"? This Star
! of David symbol could mean "We support freedom to read, and our site
! contains the "Radikal" publication which Germans are forbidden to access."
! ! (I know nothing of how such symbolic campaigns are actually launched and
! managed, so I'm suggesting the hint of an idea. I do think mirroring the
! banned publication (_any_ banned publication, by _any_ government) on as
! many sites as possible is a Good Idea.)
Can someone post an uncensored copy here?  That's a good start.  I could repost Jolly Roger which I think I archived, or post
something from Kurt Saxon in de.soc and soc.culture.german for a good start!

Bill Clinton is the Nazi of the USA.  Thank you.

! Too long. A few hours ago, the blocking ended, so Ingrid's wacky analysis ! of how this is all a ZOG plot is moot.
Your consistent defence of censorship noted.  The mere fact that
censorship is evadable, never justifies the evil.  Would you make
the claim that there are no drug laws merely because it's easy to
evade the laws against possession?
