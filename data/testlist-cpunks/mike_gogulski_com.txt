FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Defense Fund Launched for Ross Ulbricht, Accused Silk Road Marketplace Operator
New York, NY, November 20, 2013 – The family of the man accused by the US government of operating the Silk Road online marketplace has launched a fund for donations to their son's legal defense.
Ross Ulbricht, 29, was arrested on October 1st and charged with creating and operating the web marketplace Silk Road, under the pseudonym “Dread Pirate Roberts”. The allegations include a variety of conspiracies, including narcotics trafficking, computer hacking and money laundering, as well as planned acts of violence. Ulbricht denied all charges in federal court in San Francisco in October. He will appear at a bail hearing at the United States District Court, Southern District of New York at 11:00 am EST on Thursday, November 21.
On their website, the Ulbricht family states: “Our goal is to provide Ross with what every American citizen is promised: a fair trial. In the USA we are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. We firmly believe in Ross’s innocence and are working hard with the best legal team to prove it.”
The family has retained New York-based attorney Joshua L. Dratel to defend their son in court. Mr. Dratel stated: “It is crucial that we have a level playing field for defending Ross, and that requires resources from the communities that support him.”
The Ross Ulbricht Legal Defense Fund LLC is a Wyoming-based corporation established by the Ulbricht family. All donations are used solely to pay attorney fees, fund accounting fees and ancillary legal expenses.

Oh no. Please not this. I forsee a grim future in which the fairy tails
are rewritten to have cryptoknights riding out to rescue
cryptoprincesses and return them to their cryptocastles... all sealed
with a cryptokiss... *shudder*

@_subject: bitcoin as a global medium of exchange (was Re: Interesting take 
References: The concern with the current price rise and deflationary aspect seems a
bit short-sighted to me.
The mining reward is algorithmically destined to fall to less than 1
Bitcoin per block somewhere around 2032
( at which point
around 99% of all Bitcoins that will ever exist will have already been
mind. In the intervening years, Bitcoin has the potential (I dream) to
draw in most or perhaps all of the global economy. The after-2030 state
then looks like a more or less fixed money supply (99% is mined by 2060).
This is early days. I liken it to the phenomenon of momentary shock
sometimes experienced when one sits on a train, perhaps reading a book,
and misidentifies what is seen out the window as the station suddenly
moving. We're still getting up to speed.
You're still left with the
same problems though. Unless you can make the coin's real-life value
constant in some way. Best I can come up with is increasing mining payout
with the difficulty. That'll link the value of a coin to the cost of
mining, directly. Meaning you can turn electricity into coin, but not the
other way around. I suppose you'll need demurrage because else the coin
will inflate beyond making mining cost neutral, and the mining rates will
decline accordingly.
Actually.. Why isn't this how Bitcoin worked in the first place? Maybe it
just complicates things too much.

Hello Harish,
I'm going to be extremely harsh now, because that's the easiest way for
me to communicate my reaction to what you write here. If you find
disrespect or impertinence in my writing, please know that I apologize
in advance. I do not write to attack you, but perhaps to attack certain
ideas you have expressed which I see as fallacious, and I do so lacking
better linguistic strategies. If you were pointing in a different
direction, I apologize; hopefully the remainder of my drunken rant has
some value greater than that of your time reading it.

References:  <526D3E52.7090903
A bit of mis-cue here, Jacob. Coderman is quoting Tarzie's post
It criticizes *Greenwald* for implying, repeatedly, that whereas Edward
Snowden, he, Laura Poitras, and the rest are being "responsible" by
holding back and/or redacting 98+% of the NSA material, Manning and
WikiLeaks were irresponsible.
Thank goodness we've got good, proper gatekeepers on this one, with
stellar liberal credentials and the civic spirit to withhold what we
need to have withheld from us, drip-feed us heavily-redacted tidbits to
"encourage debate" about how best to send the criminal Anglo-American
Empire to its room with no supper, and no doubt round-file the rest.

I see what you're up to.
Illegitimate =? unconstitutional | unjust
As for me, I don't give a fuck about your constitutions, and in many
cases I don't care about your theories of justice either.

Hopefully that will look something like: "When the WAN LED on your $9.99
Myanmarese consumer Wi-Fi cable modem router slows its blinking rate to
sub-epileptic levels, SAFE SURFING ON THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY mode
is activated, and AL FREAKING GORE. It is now safe to press the 'connect

Of course, few will be able to extract that meaning from the
poorly-translated manual.

No puns. The subject line is the title of a late-70s Devo album, which
contains, among other horrors, the song "Secret Agent Man" (n.b.:
cavities of evil have nothing to do with fiendish fluoridators):
You know I live a life of danger for the FBI
Keeping tabs on our nation
On the land, on the sea, in the sky
But every single night before I go to bed
I get down on my knees and thank God
I'm a secret agent man
Secret agent man, secret agent man
They've given me a number
But they've taken away my name
I got one hell of a job to perform for the U. S. of A.
Got the responsibility of our nation's top security
But every night and day I salute the flag and say
Thank you Jesus 'cause I'm
I'm a secret agent man
Secret agent man, secret agent man
They've given me a number
But they've taken away my name
You know they got me doin' this doin' that
And a little bit of something else
Fighting cavities of evil, safeguarding America's health
But not an afternoon pass, I don't get up off my ass
Thank you God 'cause I'm
I'm a secret agent man
Secret agent man, secret agent man
They've given me a number
But they've taken away my name
'Cause I'm a secret agent man
