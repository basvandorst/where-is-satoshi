@_subject: Toolkit for detecting ISP modifications to web pages 
Hi Dave--
 There has recently been some discussion on both this list and the  Net Neutrality Squad mailing list about ISPs modifying web traffic  (e.g., the recent messages about Rogers modifying Google's home  page).  Related to this, I wanted to point you to a toolkit that a  server could use to detect whether its pages are being modified in  flight.  The toolkit is available at the URL below:
 The toolkit allows publishers to deploy "web tripwires" on their own  web pages.  Web tripwires are JavaScript code that can detect when a  web page is modified in flight, so that the publisher is aware of the  event and can notify the end user if appropriate.
 The URL above also has a brief summary of a measurement study that  used a web tripwire to detect changes to a web page ( ).  A message on your IP mailing list back in July helped draw users  for the study.
 We'd be happy to get feedback on either the toolkit or the study  Charlie Reis
