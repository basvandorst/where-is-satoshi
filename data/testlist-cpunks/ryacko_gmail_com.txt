I suggested on the bitcoin forums and devlist that currency minting be the
square root of current block hashing power, this would be inflationary yes,
but it would stabilize the currency and incentize mining (unlike current
plans to reduce fees further).
but you know, a hundred people who first heard of bitcoin through the
cryptography mailing list either lost their bitcoins, or own combined a
large percentage of bitcoins.
inequality begets instability.
the funny thing is that after the next block subsidy cut, a 51% attack
would easily be committed.
but if there's a major war, the world's internet connections will be
disrupted, and bitcoin would probably die in areas in which mining is less
than the biggest contiguous block of miners.
Bitcoin is the worst currency to hold during WWIII, you literally cannot
spend it until the world internet is repaired.

Common Americans are no longer considered worth protecting as part of
national security.
 Mr. Carboni,
Thank you for providing the information below.  We have conducted an
initial search within the organization that is most likely to hold records.
That organization advised that the request, as worded, is overly broad.
Querying any of our organizations would likely result in the same
response.  The phrase “malware transmitted through USB firmware” is overly
broad, such that any of our internal organizations would not be able to
determine which files to search or be able to conduct a search with a
reasonable amount of effort. Terms such as “malware” or “firmware” may turn
up in any number of NSA records and most likely would not be related to
securing home networks. Furthermore, added search without a clarification
of context and specific records sought, would incur significant fees which
would be passed on to you as an “all other” requester.
  A large facet of the NSA/CSS mission is to protect National Security
(i.e. government, DoD, Industry partners) information systems.  In doing
so, this Agency provides guidance on Information Assurance security
solutions to our Industry and Government customers regarding risk,
vulnerabilities, mitigations, and threats.  While it is not part of our
mission to provide guidance on securing home networks, we may occasionally
post information on our website as you may recall from our letter. Our
Information Assurance Directorate (IAD) has provided some information to
the public that may be of interest to you.  Here are some additional links
that you may peruse:
(this is a recent article the does provides a link regarding malware)
  The last paragraph provides a video
link under “IAD's Latest Security Guide Helps Customers Protect Home
Networks,” and there is also a fact sheet titled “Best Practices for
Keeping Your Home Network Secure.” Since the information you appear to be
requesting (protecting home networks) does not fall under the purview of
NSA/CSS missions, continued search of our files would not be productive.
Your request will be administratively closed as an improper FOIA.  If,
after reviewing the information on our website, you wish to submit a FOIA
request on similar topic(s), please provide enough detail to allow for an
accurate and focused search.

If the government produced records on how to best design a tree house, I am

@_subject: The Moral Character of Cryptographic Work 
Chomsky seems to be doing quite well for himself, so I doubt this Rogaway
will suffer much.
I think I will write on how cryptography is not a science.

@_date: 2015-12-05 15:13:21
@_author: Ryan Carboni 
@_subject: Cryptography is not a science currently 
Recently The Moral Character of Cryptographic Work was published online by
Philip Rogaway.
I am going to explain that the disciplinary culture of cryptography is not
a scientific discipline. Cryptography itself is a science. Cryptography in
many respects is the inverse of forensic science, while forensics follow a
protocol, their results are no better than guessing. While cryptography's
results are concrete, the culture is a serious failure.
Cryptographers are well aware of the moral implications of their work...
since Diffie and Hellman condemned DES's short key length (
 ). If according to Rogaway,
"Most academic cryptographers seem to think that our field is a fun, deep,
and politically neutral game—a set of puzzles involving communicating
parties and notional adversaries", the fault is not with most
cryptographers, but with all cryptographers.
Paranoid fear surrounded the AES competition, that a cipher might have a
backdoor (it turns out backdooring ciphers are more difficult than
expected). Yet after the AES report turns out the full of lies (
 ), that additions are
more vulnerable to timing attacks then... table lookups, one should do some
critical self analysis.
That a cryptographer calls for some sort of self-analysis long after the
AES competition, the SHA-3 competition, basically after all the currently
accepted ciphers have become entrenched is alarming.
Each and every cryptographer seems to fail to understand what the US
intelligence community actually does. They truly do, they do not seem to
understand that for anyone of import, they'd develop biographies on people,
if one is important enough, they might create a psychological profile.
Maybe this sounds paranoid. But given that the greatest intelligence
scandals involve what is believed to be true to be absolutely false and
what is believed to be false to be absolutely true, paranoia is to be
expected if the state takes an interest in your profession.
And all cryptographers know that the state is interested in cryptography.
What about the constant struggles of cryptographers getting their papers
published in the seventies and eighties? Maybe only Dan Bernstein remembers
that he went to court just to publish his own cipher.
Naturally for Philip Rogaway, these issues came to a head after the Snowden
disclosures (I'm still waiting for the next drip). For anyone to discredit
themselves in the first paragraph of a forty-six page PDF is amazing.
Potentially if all cryptographers somehow manage to ignore this immense
logical failing is an indictment against the entire cryptographic
profession. Especially given that it is commonly accepted that mathematics
requires logic.
Truly Rogaway is the Chomsky of Cryptography. Chomsky will deny the
Cambodian holocaust and claim that oppression in the US "isn't that bad".
For anyone to run out and say they are taking on the elite without knowing
a damn thing about anything, I wish them a lot of luck.
I might as well post a modest suggestion: cryptographers should support an
FPGA integrated into the CPU or the ability to use integrated graphics for
cryptography. This would remove entrenchment of standards, and allow people
to pick their own ciphers. It's possible the AES-NI instructions were
developed after the NSA panicked at seeing AES usage in TLS drop rapidly
after the timing attacks were revealed. The AES-NI instructions are
overkill, and seem to take CISC too literally. One only needs,
mixcolumn+subbytes, subbyte, reverse+mixcolumn+subbytes, AESIMC and
subbytes instructions of 32-bit sizes each (no need for AESENC, AESENCLAST,
AESKEYGENASSIST, AESDECLAST, AESDEC, AESIMC), it would save one
instruction, and the instruction will use only one operand. The way the
AES-NI instructions are designed precludes usage for Rijndael with 256 bit
blocks, and it seems odd that the AES-NI instructions only accept data from
the XMM registers.
Rigidity should be viewed with suspicion.

Excellent, except why didn't all the targets in Prism join all at the same

of encryption they should change their plaintext encoding? Maybe for
additional security everyone should proprietary plaintext?
So when the Snowden papers came out 20 years later they suddenly realized
Snowden isn't such a big deal.
Maybe no one cares about Nicholas Merril and his fight against a national

immunity to telecommunications providers in cooperating with the government.

Why am I wasting my time? There are thousands of events that transpired
before Snowden, and Snowden is a big deal? How is he a big deal? If you
didn't know the NSA was spying on everyone before Snowden, you're a moron
or a shill. There's no respectful way to get this point across, it's
abundantly clear to anyone with half a brain and pays attention to anything
that this is all public knowledge. To pretend that there was some big
secret before Snowden is ridiculous. The only interesting new bit of
knowledge in 2013 was parallel construction. I had no idea that the federal

The logistics of it is impossible to hide. They have satellites next to

operates DITU). The NSA has five times the budget and same number of
employees. The CIA has seven times the budget and twenty thousand
employees. This is just the US, the rest of Five Eyes puts in their fair
share as well.
To ensure staying on the topic of cryptography, how many cryptographers do
you think there are? Given the discovery of high level spies within
intelligence agencies (Redl, Ames, Hanssen), how could cryptographers hope
to assure security if the top spies can't? It has been alleged that
activist groups had been penetrated and the course of discussion
manipulated. If one million dollars per year is spent towards manipulating
cryptography, how would you think it would be used?

Law enforcement personnel and public officials may be at increased risk of

leveraging open source, publicly available information identifying officers

With this in mind, officers and public officials should be highly aware of

example, posting images wearing uniforms displaying name tags or listing
their police department on social media sites can increase an officer's
risk of being targeted or attacked.
Many legitimate online posts are linked directly to personal social media

an enhanced awareness of the content they post and how it may reflect on
themselves, their family, and their employer, or how it could be used

It just simply doesn't matter.
To have a modern lifestyle, depends upon having devices of dubious or poor
security. The government has shown a willingness to accumulate dossiers
(seemingly including IRC chats), and then leak them when it serves their
own needs.
Our Congress is criminally incompetent. The chairman of the House Oversight
committee just had his secret service application leaked, and there is no
threat of the the most powerful tools that Congress has: appropriations
micromanagement (famously done in Congressional reconstruction) or
impeachment. The same goes for Benghazi (which probably was a meeting with
a rebel group that went sour). I think our government is more malicious and
less competent than Hoover's FBI.
For comparison:
“Another early Bureau practice was to index names on lists when the list
reflected possible association with a subversive group (e.g. Communist
Party petitions or subscriptions to the Daily People's World), or where the
names might have future reference value (American Legion contacts, loyalty
forms). The heavy demands on staff time and resources, however, and the
absence of substantial information about the individuals whose names
appeared in the this context caused the Bureau to limit indexing in these
areas. In 1949 the Executive Conference decided that names on Communist
Party petitions and subscription lists to the Daily Worker and Daily
People's World be indexed in the appropriate field office only.”

I've been subjected to police harassment before and after that point
though. For legal reasons I can't explain further. Yes, exceptional claims
require exceptional evidence.
Fortunately systems are incapable of treating people as individuals, so
there must be others. Obviously the claims of "gangstalking" are nuts. But
there is the Rancid Honeytrap.  Who for some
reason is being trolled by Wikileaks? And Greenwald seems to be fine with
people trolling him?
Perhaps there is now probable cause for a reasonable person to conclude
that there's the potential of a pattern of government misconduct waiting to
be uncovered.
I made every reasonable effort to contact various advocacy / legal aid
organizations when I felt I had enough evidence to merit some help and they
have rejected me (I've sent large envelopes to them of multiple pages). I
have made anonymous letters to various journalists hoping they would
attempt to investigate a possible pattern of misconduct but I have seen no
evidence that they have done it yet. I do not plan on acknowledging those
anonymous letters as they were made a while ago, my memory isn't so great,
and they could have been intercepted and modified in transit (especially
since I didn't sign them).

Dianne Feinstein condemns Hoover, but the times were much more ambiguous in
the Cold War, the commies were funding and supporting radicals, and there
was a greater quantity of Progressive terrorism then than Islamic terrorism
today (although the quality seems to be different since people are more
afraid of Islamic terrorism). Director Comey condemns Hoover. Senator Wyden
asked Clapper a question in public, under oath, and Clapper lied. Wyden is
on the Senate's oversight committee over Clapper and Clapper still has his
job. Lying to Congress is obviously an impeachable offense (unless Congress
wants people to be employed by the taxpayers who lie to Congress).
Clearly all these people are under duress, if their public statements are
to taken as sincere expressions of opinion. Only legally allowed
explanation I can give.
An employee of the ACLU says: Over the past three years, it has become
clear that the government often performs legal acrobatics in order to
justify surveillance that was never authorized by Congress in the first
place. Such acrobatics appear to extend to the NSA’s “Upstream
surveillance,” which it operates under Section 702. (
 )
Perhaps Neema Singh Guliani is simply not representing the ACLU properly,
afterall the ACLU sued the government over FISA on the grounds it would
intercept privileged communications. (
). The same law granted retroactive immunity to telecommunications
companies, authorizing their complicity in warrantless wiretapping. But
then again, the ACLU isn't simply a legal aid organization, Ben Wizner is
acting as a secretary for Snowden, assisting him in setting up
videoconferences. And there's no legal acrobatics involved in that

I do think this is an opportunity for our members of Congress to start a
joint committee to investigate. Naturally I won't testify unless I'm given
immunity, but I'm also willing to waive all legal liability against any

In WWII, it took America several years to build up it's fighting strength

Perhaps today, if we were to start a military from scratch, it will take
fifteen years to do it (probably longer if you desire aircraft).
The point I'm making is indirect, there is a lot of inertia today brought
on by the complexity of technology. The decisions made today once fully
implemented cannot be changed for a while.
The elites have made wrong decisions, they have erred in the direction of
mass surveillance instead of mass liberty, but it did not stop the success
of terrorists. Now we are all less secure. Apparently Juniper routers were
backdoored... some of which were used by US agencies. One seems to hear
more about the OPM hack then the Obamacare website being totally insecure.
Government IT policies and organizations have been totally inadequate for a
long time. The GCHQ wants MIKEY-SAKKE, as opposed to MIKEY-DH, they don't
just want to intercept and decrypt future communications, they want to
decrypt past communications ( as if that has been a major obstacle to
investigations prior to the computer).
But I ramble, to be very clear, to make the internet itself secure, it will
probably take ten years. While frequent derisions that people don't use
encrypted databases are nonsensical, the solutions more likely to yield a
result will take longer to implement.
Basically ten years ago, all the elites made the wrong choice, and they
don't even have the excuse of saying they properly weighed the issues.

Why is the FBI against encryption?
Why did the former NSA and CIA chiefs come in favor of encryption?
Their statements are hard to decipher on the subject, but not hard to

It is usually easier to make everything but the cipher weak. Protocols
and programs commonly used are either not done properly or non
standardized, and best practices have been slow in coming.
Furthermore, the FBI has not been clear on this, but apparently they
want data in motion to be decrypted and encrypted by a central point,
and for data at rest to not be encrypted. (I seriously doubt Marcy
Wheeler's claims of Comey's charisma if he has not even been able to

For groups to organize they need to communicate. Criminals use off the
shelf encryption tools, and their devices are not continuously
connected, and even less likely to be able to run root code on each
other's devices (although social engineering does work).

design a proper protocol (AFAIK). Furthermore, you do hear in the news

Obviously if state-level actors use these methods against the NSA,
steganography does have a good role to play. Problem is that machine

be obvious that you have steganographic files, that is if photodna
