Excerpts from internet.cypherpunks: 22-Jun-96 Re: FW: Bashing "Wired" by
Bill Stewart at ix.netcom.c Bashing Wired is, in fact, a bit tired itself. I recommend checking out
 for one treatment.
Now I'm no fan of Katz's front-pager -- I thought it maundered about and
was twice as long as it needed to be. But folks who write for Wired like
Jim Warren, Brock Meeks, and Mike Godwin (and Katz) do hang out online,
basically know what's going on, and are approachable.
Somehow, I suspect that cypherpunks aren't Wired's target audience...
