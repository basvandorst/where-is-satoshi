Mark and friends -
I just returned from the Internet Expo in Boston, at which the NSA had a booth where they were pushing the FORTEZZA card. Some interesting things (at least to me):
* Netscape has a working prototype of their browser and server that uses
  FORTEZZA for encryption
* There are three (or 4??) companies building FORTEZZA cards, including   National Semi (the only one I recognized).
* The NSA guy I talked to said that they planned to market a "token card"   that uses RSA/DES, instead of Skipjack and friends, "sometime next year".
