@_subject: Small question about the list 
I've been around the Cypherpunk list for a couple of month now and
it don't correspond exactly to what I've expect.  I would be realy happy if someone could tell me the adress to remove my name
from the distribution list.
Could anyone send me the procedure on how to remove my name of the list ?
Thanks for your time and for your help,
