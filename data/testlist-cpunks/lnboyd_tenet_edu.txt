@_subject: PGP 2.3 
I don't have Usenet access, so I can't post this on the pgp newsgroup, and this is the only other place I know of to ask this...
I just got pgp23.zip and pgp23src.zip from soda, and I can't make it give valid signatures with the -a option (well, actually the Armor=on line in the config.txt file)!  It will work correctly if Armor=off, and if the file is also encrypted, but a straight signature with ascii armor appended to the message doesn't work.  Even pgp22 gives me an invalid signature "doesn't match contents" message!
Has anyone else had this problem with 2.3?  I've even re-
compiled with Borland C++ 3.1, and get the same problem.

Please forgive me!
        It seems that the signature generated by the pgp 2.3 _IS_ good (according to 2.2), in any form.  It's just that pgp 2.3 will not read a signature that is appended to an ascii message and ascii armored.  If the signature is in a separate file, or if it isn't armored, it will read it fine.  Just not a message with the signature block attached to it...
        So the problem is in the reading of the pgp signature
block, not in the generation of the signature.  I'm not very adept at programming, but am trying to work my way through
it to see if I can find the problem.
        Sorry for the previous mistake.  Again, maybe this is just my machine...
