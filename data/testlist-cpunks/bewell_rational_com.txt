@_subject: Include Your Java Applets in New Java Community 
I am Barry Ewell.  I am in the process of the developing an exciting new
Java Community with sponsors like Rational Software. It is scheduled to go
live in February.  The site will focus on the needs of and desired resources of the entire Java
development team.  The site will be promoted monthly to the international
Java community. I would like to include your applets as part of the site.  If you have more
than one, that is great.   I will make sure you have a chance to preview the
site and your appletss before the site goes live to make sure that we have
represented them as you desire.
Would you be willing to place your applets on the site?  If so, please
return this e-mail with downloads them?
I look forward to working with you.
PS.  Are you a writer? Do you have articles, Whitepapers, FAQ's or other
writings about Java that you could share with the community?  Then please
send us the link , your instructions, and we will do the rest.
