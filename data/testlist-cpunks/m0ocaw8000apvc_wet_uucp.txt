@_subject: Reply to Michael's criticism of Tim 
I think Michael's reaction to Tim's experiment re
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.children deserves comment.
Who was manipulated?  Those who reacted did so freely.
As Tim said, it was an experiment, not an attempt to
achieve anything.  The point was to see what would happen.
This mailing list is about encryption and other matters.  The use
of PGP to distribute erotica is thus a relevant topic.
I think Michael has missed the point.
I don't recall Tim's belittling anyone - except perhaps the
Net.Censors - who certainy deserve it.  I don't think we need
be too concerned about hurting their feelings.  After all,
they plan on doing worse to us.
On the contrary, were it not for the trickery some folks wouldn't
bother reading Tim's comments on this subject.
Ha!  Chortle!  Where you been all your life, Michael?
People listen to reasonable arguments only when it suits them to.
Garbage.  If we are to go into spurious psychoanalysis then I think
Michael's post reveals that he is still fixated on pleasing his parents
by being a good little boy and not giving anyone any trouble.
Fact is, there are people in the world who want to restrict our
freedom and make us behave in ways they think best.  Fuck 'em all!
