@_subject: PING packets illegal? 
Concerning the ITAR ...... what would happen if some Evil Hacker Dude in,
say, England, decided to ICMP-ping a host in America? Nothing wrong with
that ...... but if those ping packets contained little pieces of something
like PGP ...... would the host being pinged be breaking the law? Would
all the hosts in the route between that host and the host in England that
was doing the ping also be breaking the law?
