law enforcement is effective enough to prevent the average
criminal from
having access to firearms, then the law-abiding population can
be compelled to
disarm. That day is coming through US force as "Operation Gun Runner" from
ATF allowed Mexican drug cartel straw purchasers to come in, purchase
5 or
so AK-47 rifles, and when the gun store owner had suspicions
about not selling
it - the ATF told the owner to "let the guns walk"
so the group could track
down the weapons. Unfortunately, those weapons were used to kill a DEA agent
in Mexico
and a Border Patrol agent who was only armed with bean bag rounds in
his shotgun then died trying to cycle out those rounds to put in live
Also with al-CIAda patsy Adam Gahdan inaccurately reporting in his
video to other jihadists about purchasing "automatic weapons"
from gun shows,
I believe the ball is rolling for everyone in the
United States to be disarmed
through force by new legislation to
outlaw weapons. I do not think the average
gun owner would ever disarm
because the gun culture in our country is so deep
and passionate in
any freedom loving citizen's blood. The Second
Amendment, in my opinion and most gun owners agree with,
was put in the Bill
of Rights for the average citizen to remove
tyrants if the process of
democracy does not work. At present, the average criminal in my area does not
have firearms, and so I
do not own one. Gun crime is on the increase, however,
so this situation may
change. Better get one before it's too late :-) --
