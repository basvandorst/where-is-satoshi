@_subject: comments on emoney story 
There's been a few comments about my Emoney story in the December WIRED and
I thought I'd clarify a couple of things.
FROM JOHN YOUNG:
For the record, I didn't consider Chaum rude to me.  Actually our
interviews (which were considerably lengthy) were quite cordial and not at
all contentious. In fact, I think gracious would be be a better way to
describe Chaum's behavior towards me.  Perhaps John is thinking that
David's reticence to publicly talk about some personal stuff is akin to
rudeness.  If that's what came out in the story, it was certainly
And I certainly hope I was not rude to Chaum in the article. I tried to
portray him fairly, give him his say, and explain his work so that people
would agree with me that it is extremely important.
BTW, Chaum has indicated that he had no problem with the article.
FROM KAWIKA DAGUIO:
I confirm this, and it wasn't my intent to make Kawika a crusader against
anonymity, but someone who, as he says, has concerns about anonymous cash.
I've gotten some good feedback on the article, but unfortunately on the bio
line Wired misspelled my email address (!) so I'm probably missing some of
the best remarks.

@_subject: Exact quotation from Freeh on banning unapproved crypto ? 
I was the one who asked Freeh the question, after he gave a talk at the conference on Global Cryptography.  I said that while the administration is currently saying that they are not interested in regulating cryptography domestically, what if in the future the wiretaps you get yield scrambled messages that you can't decipher.  (Meaning, do you regulate then?)  Freeh asked, "In terms of encryption being a voluntary standard?"
"Yes," I said.
"Oh yeah, definitely," he said.  "If five years from now we solved the access problem, but what we're hearing is all encrypted, I'll probably, if I'm still here, be talking about that in a very different way; the objective is the The objective is for us to get those conversations whether they're by an alligator clip or ones and zeros.  Wherever they are, whatever they are, I need

@_subject: radio program - Los Angeles area only 
I was on the show. It was a good presentation, a full hour, with me, Jim Kallstrom (FBI), Bidzos, John Droge of Mykotronx (maker of clipper), Marc Rotenberg, and a NIST guy, in that order I think.  The host was especially deft at sifting the points of disagreement and allowing both sides to have a say.

@_subject: seeking Pr0duct Cypher 
I am working on a story for WIRED about digital money, and notice here that
someone named Pr0duct Cypher is behind the scheme that some people are
experimenting with.  Would Pr0duct Cypher mind contacting me?  Use this
email (steven at echonyc.com) to make the connection.
Also, if anyone else wants to point me to interesting stuff, feel free.
I'm probably on top of the obvious (Chaum, etc), but better to assume that
I'm missing stuff.

A tiny correction to Vladimir's interesting posting. It wasn't J.Gilmore I quoted on the "Titanic deck chair" in the NY Times, it was J.Barlow, who indeed has a propensity for soundbyte.

@_subject: newsweek oct 30 Levy digital cash article 
if one's hard drive crashes was answered in the affirmative by Levy.
But as I said, if the drive is backed up you don't lose it. It's my understanding this is the case with the current Digicash/Twain bucks.  But not necessarily with all implementations.
This "lose your money" with digital cash really does seem to get to people. I always point out that when you take $ out of an ATM machine, you don't expect to get it back if you lose it.  For those forms of e-money that are irretrevable when lost users are warned not to download huge amounts. Question: will people's worries about losing their e-money lead them to accept a higher degree of tracibility as a tradeoff?

It may not be a crime, but it's not nice to steal a title.

@_subject: "Hackers"-- brief review and anecdote... 
No chance. The problem for me isn't that someone wanted to call a movie Hackers but that it causes confusion in that for eleven years there has been a preexisiting work by that name.  There is a novelization of the screenplay now in paperback, so when if a friend recommends that you buy Hackers, you'll probably buy that one. (especially since Dell is determined to do as little as possible for my own book).

@_subject: "Hackers"-- brief review and anecdote... 
It's my impression that the play was staged a few years after my book came out in 1984 (though I chose the title in 1982). I remember reading the reviews then, and they didn't seem to mention that it was a revivial of a years-old play whose name I had unintentially used for my own book. (Unlike the case for the current movie, whose screenwriter seemed to know of my own book.)  If you have evidence that the play was indeed produced before 1984, please let me know.  Otherwise, I'd be happy to accept your apology, Peter.

@_subject: Denning interview in Wired 
This was not an interview, but an article.  Though all quotes are accurate (and checked with the source) it was me who did the choosing, so it's really not fair to fault Dorothy for not addressing issues x and y, etc.For a more comprehensive defense of her position you can go to her web site, where she has lotsa position papers.
Incidentally, I didn't set out to rehash the Clipper issues in the article, but to try to give some insight into Dorothy herself. On Mon, 26

Didn't mean to be defensive or criticize you, Vladimir.  Just wanted to make it clear that the story didn't necessarily include all her reasonings. You make some fine points.

@_subject: Codebreakers on the shelves! 
The events occuring after the finish of the original codebreakers (beginning the seventies, and including public key, Clipper ,etc) and covered lightly in the rewrite will be at the center of my book CRYPTO, which I am still finishing. Meanwhile, the re-release of Codebreakers is a firm reminder of Kahn's awesomeness.

@_subject: A Sign of the Future 
Give me a break.  I do not work for Wired but I write for them at times, and most often my subject is crypto related. I can tell you for a fact that there is no anti-cypherpunk policy there. I have a long article that deals in part with cypherpunk-related cryptanlysis in the March issue and I was, as is always the case, left to make my own editorial judgement.

@_subject: Class III InfoWar: TST Article 
If it's a myth, it's quite an elaborate one. On Saturday night I was interviewed by the BBC about this.  The producer read the entire article to me, telling me in was on the front page of the Times. (My comments were not about the specific story, but the underlying security issues.) I don't think he was making it up.
Maybe the London Times isn't on Nexus.
